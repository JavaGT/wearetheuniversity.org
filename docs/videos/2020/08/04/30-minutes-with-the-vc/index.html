opening convocation and<br>in the beginning a lot of these things<br>were happening somewhere else<br>and they weren't directly affecting us<br>here at otago<br>for us the immediate impact of the<br>pandemic announcement meant that our<br>chinese students couldn't come to join<br>us<br>and that really took up a huge amount of<br>our time in thinking in the beginning of<br>2020<br>those were the students we were focused<br>on we started thinking<br>first about how we could support our<br>chinese students who were offshore<br>and we began academic planning<br>to provide them with online learning<br>and because this university is is so<br>traditional in its approach to education<br>which has<br>stood us well for 150 years there was a<br>bit of resistance in the beginning<br>one of the things that we did<br>immediately was to gather together<br>mandarin speaking students here on<br>campus<br>and had them contact personally students<br>offshore and their families<br>and i think that was a really good<br>opportunity for<br>students who were essentially stranded<br>in their own home country desperately<br>trying to get back to otago<br>to speak to someone here about the kinds<br>of support that we could provide<br>so i think that person-to-person<br>communication was really best in show<br>and i'm incredibly grateful for all of<br>the mandarin speakers<br>here at otago who put their hand up<br>identified themselves and said and<br>and literally sat on the phones around<br>the clock contacting those students<br>so i think in that sense we did a really<br>good job obviously<br>they can continue to study with us and<br>as difficult as that might be many of<br>those chinese students are sticking with<br>us<br>because they still see this as an<br>interim step<br>one of the things we were really lucky<br>in new zealand is that the prime<br>minister provided us with<br>very clear compassionate and almost<br>daily updates about her thinking<br>and when she initially set forth the<br>alert levels i thought<br>all right this is actually going to go<br>someplace<br>that we probably have not anticipated<br>and at that stage the senior leadership<br>team<br>started meeting daily and it was those<br>daily updates<br>that we were all bringing together<br>information that we had from various<br>places<br>that indicated that the train was going<br>only one way<br>and that was towards lockdown so i think<br>it was<br>initially watching her publish the alert<br>system<br>indicated that there would be a level<br>four and that we needed to get our house<br>in order to be able to provide education<br>under those circumstances<br>one of the decisions that we made early<br>on was<br>to pause our teaching only for a week<br>once the prime minister made the<br>announcement that we would be going into<br>lockdown<br>at midnight on the wednesday we paused<br>our teaching on monday<br>but the decision that we made was to<br>begin teaching the following monday<br>with a very brief break and not every<br>university made that decision<br>but our thinking on this was that every<br>single thing<br>in our students lives was<br>in upheaval and the one thing that we<br>could do<br>to provide some normalcy and some<br>consistency<br>was to keep the teaching on track so we<br>did make the decision early on<br>that we would only take that one week<br>break and then immediately jump back<br>into<br>it now initially a handful of students<br>emailed me<br>and said they were finding it difficult<br>and they were aware that other<br>universities had taken a greater pause<br>and had<br>had a toggle thought about taking a<br>longer break<br>and i responded personally to each of<br>the students who contacted me<br>and i explained the rationale that<br>really what we wanted to do was to have<br>something constant in their life<br>and not a single student blocked at that<br>they all understood the reasoning and i<br>think<br>now in hindsight they're very grateful<br>that we made that decision<br>because they're finished with semester<br>one and many of their other colleagues<br>around the country are still<br>in the heat of either their lectures or<br>when i reflect on some of the things<br>that happened in the beginning there<br>were a lot of times when i was getting<br>high-level briefings from the ministry<br>of health from the ministry of education<br>from the tec<br>from my own staff but some of the<br>biggest changes in my own thinking<br>actually came from interactions with<br>students<br>and in particular i have a a former<br>chinese phd student who is now my<br>postdoc and<br>i was speaking to her in the early<br>phases of the pandemic<br>and we were talking about her own family<br>in china<br>so her parents were in lockdown at the<br>time and she was describing how they<br>were going about their daily life that<br>only one person could go out to get<br>groceries they could only be out for 30<br>minutes and<br>and she said it was a really good thing<br>because<br>it was keeping them safe and i remember<br>clearly saying to her<br>that's amazing but that could never<br>happen<br>in a western democratic country there<br>would never be an instance where a<br>government<br>could force their citizens to stay home<br>and of course fast forward just a matter<br>of a few weeks<br>and that was exactly what had happened<br>here in new zealand<br>so i think in thinking back for me that<br>that really demonstrates how<br>quickly my thinking changed about<br>not only the seriousness of the pandemic<br>but also the lengths that we were going<br>to have to go<br>in new zealand and at the university of<br>otago in order to keep our own people<br>safe<br>i think one of the greatest achievements<br>of the lockdown<br>was the lengths that academic staff went<br>to<br>to maintain contact with their students<br>so<br>the technical distribution of the<br>lecture material may not have been world<br>class<br>it wasn't designed to be world-class it<br>was a response to an emergency<br>but what was world-class was the human<br>face-to-face virtual interaction that<br>staff<br>had with students and i know so many of<br>them<br>held multiple additional tutorials were<br>available<br>almost on call to students on zoom or by<br>text or<br>by email to help students adjust<br>to this new learning environment so i'm<br>not<br>for a minute going to claim that the<br>online teaching that we did would<br>compete<br>with the best online teaching in the<br>world but i am willing to bet<br>that the human contribution to that<br>online teaching would<br>be absolutely best in show and certainly<br>the emails that i've received from<br>students during lockdown<br>and since lockdown have really<br>highlighted how much they appreciated<br>the huge amount of support that they<br>received from their teachers<br>and their tutors at a time which for<br>otago made the decision again very early<br>on that the colleges would remain<br>open and that we would continue to look<br>after students<br>throughout the alert levels and the<br>ministry of health was really keen on<br>that strategy because their concern<br>was that students might go back into<br>their communities<br>and although coveted 19 wouldn't affect<br>them<br>as badly if they were positive it might<br>in fact<br>infect you know their grandparents and<br>their elderly neighbors so they were<br>really<br>really keen for us to keep them here and<br>we were keen to have them and<br>one of the great things about collegiate<br>life at otago is that<br>our students have live-in adults who are<br>there with them 24 hours a day<br>so all of our collegiate staff not only<br>work with students during their working<br>hours but they actually live<br>directly on site which meant that the<br>colleges were a perfect place to look<br>after young people during lockdown<br>so in one college for example we might<br>have had 75 students<br>and at the same time we probably had<br>seven to ten staff<br>who were living with them during the<br>lockdown providing them with outstanding<br>care 24 hours a day and i think<br>that constant presence of other caring<br>adults<br>really helped to support students in<br>collegiate life<br>during the lockdown in the beginning i<br>think the students who stayed behind<br>probably felt a little uncertain because<br>their<br>collegiate life was different they had<br>to maintain social distancing they had<br>to establish<br>smaller bubbles within their bigger<br>college bubble<br>i think they probably were uncertain<br>about how things were going to unfold<br>but the colleges as you might expect<br>really rose to the challenge<br>and created normalcy<br>out of a completely abnormal situation<br>and they really went above and beyond to<br>provide these students<br>with a fun and engaging<br>and you know community of care<br>environment while also supporting them<br>in their studies<br>the students who stayed behind in the<br>colleges were obviously posting on<br>facebook about<br>what they were doing and and how they<br>were feeling<br>and it wasn't long before students who<br>had gone home<br>were contacting the university to find<br>out you know when they were going to be<br>able to come back<br>and when the signal came that they could<br>come back some of the students arrived<br>with their bags on their college<br>doorstep at midnight<br>saying okay we're here so i think that's<br>a really good signal of how<br>the students who got who had gone home<br>had already felt this really strong<br>connection to their college<br>but also how students who remained in<br>the colleges were sending signals out<br>to their college mates around new<br>zealand saying you know<br>we're really having a great time and we<br>one of the first things that i saw with<br>the professional staff was that<br>everybody took charge of their own area<br>and got stuff done again if i think back<br>to last year<br>one of the things that characterizes<br>otago is that we don't change<br>rapidly we like to think about things we<br>like to debate them endlessly<br>but covet really stopped all that and it<br>gave people permission and license<br>to do what they thought was best in<br>their particular area of the university<br>so you know by way of a few examples the<br>um the chief operating officer came to<br>me<br>about a month before lockdown and said<br>he was going to move 50 of his critical<br>staff off site and<br>and i thought he was crazy that he was<br>really overreacting and that he was<br>going to scare people<br>but i said you do what you think is best<br>and and thank goodness he did<br>because it meant that we were able to<br>continue with payroll and<br>and i.t and a whole host of things<br>because he had the foresight that we<br>were going to need<br>to have some people off site but that<br>happened throughout the university not<br>only at the highest levels of the chief<br>operating officer<br>what amazed me was watching how<br>different parts of the university really<br>took<br>charge of their own activity you know by<br>way of one really public example<br>um in pharmacy the the city and the<br>country was running out of hand<br>sanitizer<br>so they took it upon themselves to<br>become a production facility<br>producing literally leaders and leaders<br>and leaders of hand sanitizer<br>for emergency services<br>i don't think they asked anybody if they<br>could do it i i don't think they sought<br>permission from the head of the<br>department or the dean<br>or the pro vice chancellor and they<br>certainly didn't ask me but thank<br>goodness they had the foresight<br>to just take charge of something that<br>they could do<br>the same thing happened with it many of<br>the i.t experts<br>started running zoom tutorials with<br>people to help get them online<br>to facilitate moving teaching materials<br>they<br>made themselves accessible to people at<br>a moment's notice<br>and again somebody must have been<br>leading that but<br>it certainly wasn't me it was that area<br>and the leaders in that area and people<br>like<br>emerson pratt who just really galvanized<br>their people to do whatever they had to<br>do<br>in order to keep the university running<br>recreation support services the gym was<br>completely closed but<br>they then provided a full online program<br>of activity<br>and exercise for students both on campus<br>and those students who had gone home for<br>the duration of lockdown<br>again i don't recall them asking<br>permission or<br>seeking advice they just did what they<br>thought was necessary<br>during these unprecedented conditions<br>and that<br>those examples were repeated throughout<br>the university<br>and and it just happened over and over<br>and over again<br>and that's one of the things that i hope<br>we don't lose coming out of covet i hope<br>we can continue<br>to be brave and be bold and take<br>decisions that we need to take<br>at the time they need to happen so that<br>that stuff can get done<br>rather than getting ourselves caught up<br>in a in a complex decision-making<br>process where lots of people have to be<br>consulted about this that and the other<br>thing<br>there are lots of instances in which<br>that has to happen but there are so many<br>instances where we just need to empower<br>the people at the coal face<br>to do the job that needs to be done and<br>this<br>university has demonstrated time and<br>time again during<br>covet 19 that that we've got the ability<br>i think one of the great things that the<br>prime minister did during the<br>new zealand's response was to talk about<br>our team of five million<br>and and i think that provides an<br>outstanding framework for us to think<br>about how otago responded because<br>within the team of five million we also<br>had our team of 25 000<br>staff and students and every single<br>member of that team<br>played their part so in addition to<br>staying at home<br>in order to save lives in new zealand<br>our staff and students were still going<br>about their business of providing<br>education<br>and of learning so every single person<br>here<br>did something in order to make that<br>possible<br>so from the senior leadership level we<br>were really really lucky to have<br>the support of public health officials<br>and experts from our own university<br>those people that were advising the<br>prime minister were also advising us<br>and that was a huge advantage that<br>allowed<br>us to work our way through complex<br>material<br>to learn about a virus that none of us<br>knew anything about and to feel really<br>confident in the decisions that we were<br>making<br>so i'm incredibly grateful that we had<br>that expertise<br>but we had other expertise as well we<br>had emergency management expertise we<br>had communications expertise<br>we had academic staff who<br>just a few weeks earlier were arm<br>wrestling with parts of the university<br>about providing education<br>online immediately getting their<br>materials and making them available to<br>students<br>we had professional staff who made that<br>possible<br>i've often laughed and my my adult<br>children laughed that<br>the irony has not escaped them that it<br>was<br>boomers teaching zoomers and the boomers<br>definitely didn't have<br>the technical expertise many of us to do<br>the kinds of things that we were asked<br>to do<br>so in many instances it was students<br>helping staff to<br>get their materials online or supporting<br>them when they couldn't figure out what<br>to do on zoom<br>so it was a real community effort<br>teamwork by<br>25 000 people in order to get through a<br>semester that we have now completed very<br>successfully<br>one of the biggest changes at the<br>university over the last few years has<br>been the establishment of the ascotago<br>team<br>and they were really at the front line<br>during much<br>of their university's response to<br>covid19<br>they provided a huge amount of support<br>to both staff and students with respect<br>to their daily welfare checks<br>where they literally rang or contacted<br>people by email<br>who were alone or who were unwell to<br>check<br>on them on a daily basis and again i<br>think that signals the huge human to<br>human contact that we tried to provide<br>at the university even though we were<br>all<br>locked down in our own home bubbles<br>the other really important service that<br>askitago provided which<br>in many ways i think saved us during the<br>pandemic<br>was their very clear and careful<br>communication<br>they were the one source of truth when<br>people from the outside or from<br>university staff and students contacted<br>them<br>they had the answers to the questions<br>and there was only one answer<br>and i think that really helped<br>people to get a clear sense that the<br>university<br>was under control ascotago's<br>response to questions was sometimes<br>updated three or four times a day<br>because the situation was evolving very<br>quickly<br>and there's no way that we could have<br>distributed that level and frequency of<br>change in any other way<br>if we didn't have ascotago so as one of<br>the newest<br>services on campus they've really had<br>their metal tested during the pandemic<br>and i couldn't be prouder of what they<br>one of the things that positioned us<br>really well for responding<br>to the challenges of covet 19 was the<br>incident management team which is led by<br>andy ferguson<br>and we are really lucky to have andy at<br>the helm<br>he has stood beside us during other<br>emergencies in the past<br>and he's also a person who is very<br>concerned about<br>training not only his staff but also<br>training us<br>and he's got systems and procedures<br>in place to deal with any emergency that<br>might<br>might happen so i felt as i always<br>feel when andy takes control of an<br>emergency<br>that we were in really good hands he<br>continued<br>and continues to provide steadfast<br>advice to me and to the university<br>he's gained the trust and the respect of<br>the vast majority of the university<br>community<br>who depends on him to provide us with<br>advice<br>to make sure that the water is going to<br>continue to run<br>and that the electricity will still work<br>and that will have sufficient rations<br>and supplies<br>no matter what happens and so i again i<br>think the university was served<br>incredibly well<br>by having that depth of talent as part<br>i think one of the the most important<br>lessons that we learned in response to<br>the pandemic<br>is the value of teamwork so<br>very early on the senior emergency<br>management team<br>started meeting daily and that group<br>obviously consists of the vice<br>chancellor's advisory group but it was<br>also supported by other<br>expertise around the university so<br>andy ferguson as the head of the<br>emergency management team is part of<br>that group<br>we had megan mcpherson the director of<br>communications was part of that team<br>we had public health expertise in the<br>form of professor philip hill who<br>participated in that<br>team and we also had our ousa president<br>mr jack manning so we<br>had quite broad coverage around the<br>university and we met<br>every single day initially in person in<br>the lead up to the lockdown<br>and then during the lockdown we met<br>every day by zoom<br>and those daily meetings allowed every<br>person<br>who held a leadership position to<br>communicate to the others<br>what was happening in their particular<br>portfolio<br>it also allowed people to feed<br>information in to each other that they<br>had learned from other sources or<br>problems that we had to solve<br>we put our heads together and we made<br>decisions<br>we made them quickly on limited<br>information because that's what we had<br>but because all of the people were in<br>the zoom room<br>at a time i think the decisions we made<br>were really good<br>so again i don't want to lose that<br>teamwork<br>going forward i think every senior<br>leader at the university now<br>knows more not only about their own<br>portfolio<br>but also about the portfolio of all the<br>other senior leaders<br>than they ever would have taken the time<br>to learn<br>before it does feel like everyone had<br>everyone else's back and that people<br>were prepared to provide<br>fair and frank advice critique<br>commentary about what was happening so i<br>think collectively<br>because we worked so well together the<br>level and the quality of the decisions<br>that we made were much better<br>than they would have been had we all<br>been off in our own little areas<br>and because we also had that lovely<br>contribution of public<br>health advice everything that we were<br>doing was<br>consistent with what was happening in<br>the rest of the country<br>and we were making the decisions that<br>were not only best for education<br>but also best for the safety of our<br>the question i've been asked the most<br>why in the world did you put a student<br>on the senior executive team<br>and i think for us the decision was<br>really very simple<br>the university of otago first and<br>foremost is a school<br>and it was important for us to have<br>input from the student community<br>about the kinds of decisions that we<br>were making<br>it was a risk because we brought jack<br>inside the tent and he had access to<br>every piece of information that the<br>other senior leaders had including all<br>of the<br>sensitive financial information all of<br>the government briefing information that<br>we had<br>and his contribution was equal<br>to every other member of that team<br>jack kept our moral compass focused<br>fiercely<br>on students which is the way it should<br>have been<br>he raised issues with us that we needed<br>to consider<br>we worked through our solutions with him<br>we road tested ideas with him<br>which he then subsequently road tested<br>with the student community<br>and i think it allowed us to move<br>through some<br>complex and potentially controversial<br>decisions in a much<br>more successful way than would have been<br>possible without jack's contribution<br>and it wasn't only jack i mean jack was<br>in the senior tent but<br>many other members of the ousa exec<br>also made invaluable contributions<br>during the pandemic<br>emily coyle who is the education officer<br>was a fundamental member of the team<br>that was developing the online exam<br>system<br>she was fundamental in bringing the<br>discussion about<br>the grade bump to the table so<br>these young people really were working<br>well beyond their years<br>but the university's response to covet<br>19 is better<br>because of the contributions that they<br>made<br>one of the greatest gifts that we have<br>in the new zealand<br>tertiary education system is that our<br>academic freedom is enshrined in<br>legislation we are really obliged<br>to be the critic and conscience of<br>society and<br>when we reflect on covert 19<br>obviously there was a lot of the of our<br>experience that<br>you know made us fearful and uncertain<br>and<br>challenged our thinking about a whole<br>host of things but but the one thing<br>that gave me immense confidence<br>during this whole process was the<br>incredible depth of talent the<br>university of otago has<br>in the area of public health many of our<br>academics<br>stood up quite boldly and very early<br>to say things that not everybody wanted<br>to hear<br>so our contribution not only the<br>contribution of those people to the<br>university<br>but more importantly perhaps to the<br>nation is<br>a source of immense pride not only for<br>me but<br>i suspect for the entire university<br>it was amazing to watch people who i<br>have known for years whose work i have<br>respected<br>whose opinions i value including people<br>like sir david skagg<br>professor david murdock professor<br>phillip hill dr ayesha verrill<br>professor michael baker professor nick<br>wilson<br>i mean these are people i have known for<br>a very long period of time<br>and all of a sudden they were becoming<br>common knowledge throughout new zealand<br>because<br>they were providing the words of wisdom<br>to the government about how we should<br>react<br>and right now if we look at the way in<br>which new zealand is positioned<br>internationally<br>our response to covet 19 the prime<br>minister's leadership<br>the leadership of the director general<br>of health is being held up<br>as best in show but i think we all need<br>to acknowledge that the reason that the<br>prime minister and the director general<br>of health could do their job so well<br>is because they took the advice of the<br>experts here at the university of otago<br>and and internationally this needs to be<br>a model<br>going forward not only for this disaster<br>but for any disaster<br>that universities have an amazing wealth<br>of knowledge<br>that can be used for the common good and<br>we saw that<br>day after day after day during covet 19<br>where experts around the university<br>the danger of hindsight in reviewing<br>how the university or the country<br>responded to the pandemic<br>is to assume that we had time<br>we never had the luxury of time<br>everything was happening and changing<br>quite dramatically we started talking<br>about covet time as being 48 hours that<br>we'll this is our decision now but in 48<br>hours we're going to have to reconsider<br>it so i'm not sure we could have done<br>anything differently because<br>everything we did was a function of new<br>information<br>that we were receiving in many ways it's<br>probably good that in the beginning we<br>didn't know<br>how it would end because we had to do<br>things in the beginning that we would<br>have been quite fearful about i think if<br>we would have known<br>where we were headed so we just<br>approached each<br>decision as it came before us and i'm<br>thinking for example<br>of the the issue of the number of<br>students that we had abroad and we<br>haven't really talked about that that in<br>addition to<br>international students who were stuck<br>and couldn't get to a toggle we also had<br>a large number of study abroad students<br>and<br>trainee interns who were overseas at the<br>beginning of the pandemic<br>and the question was what should we call<br>them home or not<br>and and for me the biggest lesson<br>learned<br>was as the virus started infecting<br>countries where our students were<br>located like italy for example<br>and we called our students back from<br>italy and<br>and we got a lot of pushback in the<br>beginning from students from<br>parents saying this isn't a big deal<br>you're overreacting<br>let them stay it will be fine and i<br>remember having those conversations with<br>students and with families<br>and within 72 hours things had changed<br>so dramatically<br>that those same students were on flights<br>coming back to new zealand<br>so it's that rapid pace in which the<br>world<br>changed dramatically<br>that would have made it impossible i<br>think for us to make decisions in a<br>different<br>way you know in hindsight there are also<br>things that<br>if a pandemic was going to happen thank<br>goodness we had done some stuff<br>so our our university wi-fi for example<br>the upgrades that we had done to i.t<br>in the last few years imagine if we<br>hadn't done that what would happen<br>imagine if we didn't have ascotago what<br>would have happened<br>imagine if we didn't have key people in<br>the roles who who were in those roles<br>who had many<br>many of them had recently joined the<br>university or had recently taken up the<br>role that they had<br>imagine if they weren't there so rather<br>than thinking about<br>would we have
