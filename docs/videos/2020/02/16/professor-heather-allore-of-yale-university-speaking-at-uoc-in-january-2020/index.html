before we get into the<br>slides and everything let me just kind<br>of give you an overview of why we're<br>going to be talking about chronic<br>conditions dementia and and caregiving<br>today and this arose out of my work with<br>a number of doctors and healthcare<br>professionals that were really noticing<br>that their patients that had cognitive<br>impairment that is a whole spectrum from<br>mild to profound dementia that they also<br>had typically multiple chronic or<br>long-term conditions and that we expect<br>older adults to be able to manage many<br>chronic conditions that often have<br>multiple medications and these<br>medications or injections have to be<br>given at different times they have to<br>change their diet in lifestyle and this<br>is complicated when you're cognitively<br>intact let alone when you have cognitive<br>impairment and so much of the burden<br>would fall on caregivers of these older<br>adults and they found that caregivers<br>rarely had any training on how to do<br>this very little understanding of the<br>chronic conditions and often they<br>themselves had multiple chronic<br>conditions they were trying to take care<br>of and so that's really what motivated a<br>whole line of research and I'm going to<br>touch on a little bit of that today so<br>I'm just going to acknowledge I'm really<br>grateful for foundations in New Zealand<br>that are supporting my visit<br>they include aging well National Science<br>challenge and Canterbury health care of<br>the elderly education service Education<br>Trust and much of the work you're going<br>to see has been funded by the National<br>Institutes of Health their National<br>Institute of Aging and I have no<br>conflicts of interest<br>so this as I told you some of the<br>motivation behind this work it also<br>stems from in the u.s. our Department of<br>Health and Human Services published<br>something called the multiple chronic<br>conditions a strategic framework and I<br>believe you often call these long-term<br>conditions chronic conditions and it<br>really asked us to be engaging more and<br>shared decision-making because patients<br>are facing multiple diseases and they're<br>often in the u.s. their healthcare is<br>fractured so they may go to the<br>cardiologists for their heart disease<br>they may go to a doctor for their kidney<br>disease they may see a different doctor<br>for their diabetes and they may be<br>getting conflicting information and<br>there really isn't a sharing and setting<br>of what matters most to that person what<br>is that goal setting and so this<br>strategic framework called for setting<br>that and really partnering in<br>decision-making and to really realize<br>that not all patients are the same and<br>as as we age we find that there's more<br>diversity in the mix of conditions<br>people have and their ability to care<br>for them and treatments don't always<br>work the same so we know you can take a<br>pill for your blood pressure and it's<br>not going to work the same on everybody<br>because there's a different mix of<br>diseases that person has and so we<br>realize there's more and more variation<br>so let's talk a little bit about the top<br>calming chronic conditions and older<br>adults and so this is from the National<br>Council on Aging and so here we can see<br>high blood pressure most common<br>condition high cholesterol we see our<br>thright is's very common and this is 65<br>and older once you get into the 80s<br>you're seeing that<br>these are very very common and we see<br>that 80% of people over 65 have at least<br>one chronic condition and and over<br>two-thirds have at least two chronic<br>conditions and so we can see there's<br>several heart diseases kidney diseases<br>depression and we see Alzheimer's<br>disease and other dementias is about 11%<br>but we have to understand that many<br>cognitive impairments are not diagnosed<br>or are under diagnosed and that comes as<br>a result of stigmas it comes as a result<br>of people feeling that nothing can be<br>done but what they don't realize is<br>there may be services provided such as<br>services in New Zealand are provided<br>that it's often in access to other forms<br>of care and that there may be medication<br>changes that may allow cognition to<br>remain stable for longer before<br>declining so it is not a hopeless<br>situation and often our social factors<br>are very important in the maintaining of<br>cognitive health I'm going to be talking<br>a lot about functional disabilities and<br>these are really based on the concept of<br>activities of daily living and these are<br>considered essential activities a person<br>must be able to perform themselves to be<br>able to live independently so these are<br>relatively basic things these are eating<br>bathing dressing getting from a chair to<br>a bed toileting walking or some sort of<br>moving around if that's with an assisted<br>device and we know that these can change<br>over time so much of the work I have<br>done has been on functional disability<br>and we know that there may be a period<br>especially after hospitalization that it<br>may a person may need assistance and one<br>or more of these activities but they may<br>be<br>to recover that function so it's not<br>once a person as a disability it's a<br>permanent disability but they're<br>changing all the time so this slide is<br>from the Ministry of Health here in New<br>Zealand and they also take a multi<br>morbidity or multiple condition approach<br>and I thought this was a lovely a lovely<br>slide from the National Institute for<br>clinical excellence guidelines in 2016<br>because it's you can see all the<br>elements are and their focus is about<br>improving the quality of life so it's<br>very patient-centered and those as I<br>said it's very important to assess that<br>person's needs what are their needs what<br>are their goals and treatment<br>preferences what are their priorities<br>and that's really where we need to keep<br>our focus if we see over here the<br>benefits and risks of following single<br>disease guidelines at least in the u.s.<br>we have developed a lot of guidelines<br>that other countries follow as well and<br>it's really based on a single disease<br>approach with a biologic outcome so<br>maybe you're left ejection fraction is<br>improved if you take this drug but<br>rarely does anybody feel that and rarely<br>is that anybody's goal or their<br>preference what they want to do is they<br>want to walk up the stairs because their<br>bedrooms on the second floor and their<br>kitchens on the first floor and they<br>just want to be able to be in their<br>house and they're saying I'm having<br>chest pain I feel fatigued I feel dizzy<br>when I try and go up the stairs and so<br>there's a real shift between how we've<br>developed and tested medicines and<br>medical procedures and devices from how<br>people want to live their lives and<br>what's important to them and so that's<br>why when we consider guidelines that are<br>solely based on following a single<br>disease protocols they may not fit for<br>so let's talk a little bit about<br>cognition and function so if I was only<br>more clever here we go so if we see this<br>blue box up here in the UK in 2016 they<br>found that about 3 &amp; 5 carers say that<br>their health has been affected<br>negatively by caring for someone with<br>dementia so we're often our focus is on<br>there's a person they have a condition<br>that's where that's where our focus is<br>but the carers also face burdens<br>remember some carers are older they also<br>have their own health conditions some<br>carers are adult children and they're<br>the Sandwich Generation they're taking<br>care of their own kids they're taking<br>care of their parents so we really have<br>to to realise that care is that that is<br>affected by the health as well so having<br>the cognitive impairments and then<br>functional disabilities those activities<br>of daily living that are required much<br>of that at least in the u.s. is covered<br>is provided by cures that are unpaid<br>right these are family members spouses<br>partners adult children cousins extended<br>family and we've found that providing<br>substantial health is associated with<br>the caregiver having difficulties with<br>emotional regulation their physical<br>health as well as their finances so<br>we've we've tried to expand where the<br>research was very focused on that person<br>with dementia and their their behaviors<br>and what we really want to look at is is<br>some of the management of those chronic<br>conditions for that person who can't<br>manage them themselves is there a role<br>in that and and what does that really<br>matter so here we can see these are us<br>numbers this is from the<br>Arpi which is the Association for the<br>Advancement of retired people and we see<br>that families in the u.s. spend nearly<br>$7,000 out-of-pocket for caregiving and<br>nearly twelve thousand US dollars on<br>average if that caregiver doesn't live<br>with the person so they live at some<br>470 billion US dollars in unpaid care so<br>when you want to say is this an<br>expensive condition and should we fund<br>social services and should we improve<br>the quality of life not just medically<br>because I think generally medical<br>services are doing an excellent job but<br>in the u.s. it's four hundred and<br>seventy billion dollars and that's using<br>our minimum wage scale and we know that<br>more than three and four family<br>caregivers are incurring out-of-pocket<br>costs as a result of caregiving so<br>that's beyond that four hundred seventy<br>billion and family caregivers are<br>spending on average nearly 20 percent of<br>their income on caregiving activities so<br>that's why providing these social<br>supports and services and well-being<br>factors at least has a real monetary<br>cost it's a hidden cost but it's real<br>I'd like to just draw your attention New<br>Zealand is paying attention to this and<br>you have publications such as improving<br>the lives of people with dementia the<br>estimate was from a few years ago that<br>50,000 people have to mention New<br>Zealand we're going to expect that to<br>grow to 78,000 by 2026 and it's very<br>costly it's costing this the medical<br>care was costing 1 billion dollars<br>annually in New Zealand and these costs<br>are<br>affected to rise as a number of people<br>with dementia are increasing because of<br>populations aging<br>and your Ministry of Health's<br>publication health losses in New Zealand<br>from 2013 said that dementia was one of<br>the top four leading causes of health<br>loss in people 75 or older so it's not<br>just Americans that are facing this I<br>really liked this graphic from New<br>Zealand carers strategy and action plan<br>I there may be some new newer<br>information that the panelists will be<br>sharing with us this is from your<br>Ministry of Social Development and it<br>really recognizes that what I really<br>like is that it's very person-centered<br>it recognizes the roles of family and<br>friends awareness keeping well so this<br>is not conceptualizing aging as a<br>disease aging is not a disease aging is<br>a good process there's a lot that older<br>lives contain and so what we need to do<br>is keep supporting that yes we face<br>challenges but aging is not a disease<br>you may have diseases but there's social<br>supports that can as well as your health<br>supports that can address this I'm going<br>to talk to you about a concept of a type<br>of caregiver called a Care Partner and<br>we define this a little differently than<br>just a broad caregiver and so we define<br>it as a person who sat with their care<br>recipient during a doctor visit in the<br>last year or who helped the care<br>recipient with a prescribed medication<br>in the last month some caregivers may be<br>providing support in those activities of<br>daily living they may be cooking meals<br>they may be doing laundry<br>housekeeping any number of things we're<br>really trying to focus on that<br>management of those chronic conditions<br>so we're looking at<br>this concept of a care partner so this<br>was defined so we have a nationally<br>represented study of Americans we call<br>it the National Health and Ageing trend<br>study it is of Medicare is an American<br>insurance scheme for older people it's<br>supported by the government people who<br>are 65 or older are eligible for that<br>program so we use data from that and we<br>looked at as I showed you earlier there<br>were a number of very common chronic<br>conditions so we looked at several of<br>those that were symptomatic that you<br>could feel you have them and non<br>symptomatic but they such as high<br>cholesterol high blood pressure and poor<br>thyroid function but those may affect<br>your well-being in a number of ways<br>what's so in this in this study they<br>have a number of cognitive measures and<br>they didn't have a physician per se<br>interview each person to decide if they<br>had dementia or not but they used a<br>number of common screening scales to to<br>ascertain if a person had normal<br>cognition possible dementia or probable<br>dementia and so we're going to talk a<br>little bit about just probable dementia<br>in this data set because it kind of<br>points out under diagnosis are not<br>understanding your diagnosis and so here<br>we can see of the individuals with<br>probable dementia over 19% were<br>diagnosed but they were unaware of<br>really what dementia was or that<br>condition and the characteristics<br>associated with that was they had less<br>education they attended medical visits<br>alone so remember one of the roles of<br>the Care Partner was they part they went<br>with the person to medical visits and<br>they had fewer functional impairments<br>they're they're pretty intact and being<br>able to transfer move around bathe dress<br>things like that but the more may be<br>more alarming as nearly 40% were<br>undiagnosed but by these clinical<br>measures we would say they have probable<br>dementia so there's a lot of undiagnosed<br>and though it characteristics associated<br>with that was being Hispanic which is a<br>very large ethnic minority in the US and<br>then the rest were the same less<br>education and tended medical visits<br>alone and had fewer functional<br>impairments so then we had a question so<br>among these multi morbid persons with<br>cognitive impairment does having a Care<br>Partner modify the impact of these<br>chronic conditions on the number of<br>activities of daily living that that<br>person could perform and again we're<br>kind of motivated by there's in the u.s.<br>there's 40 million older adults and of<br>those 8 million or 20% have multiple<br>chronic conditions and then we can see<br>that those with chronic conditions and<br>ADL disabilities have about our about<br>double of in the spending and so<br>collectively we're looking at more than<br>a hundred and forty billion dollars when<br>you're looking at the cost of people<br>that have multiple chronic conditions<br>and functional impairments so here's a<br>little bit about the data this is going<br>to generalize to oh about 3.6 million<br>Americans and we can see the vast<br>majority so these are all people with<br>cognitive impairment by this screener<br>and two or more of these chronic<br>conditions and we can see those that<br>have<br>Keir partner present which would be the<br>vast majority they tend to be older they<br>tend to need more help in more<br>activities and they a higher proportion<br>quite a few nearly half had been in the<br>hospital within 12 months of baseline<br>with if we just want to kind of look at<br>are there some differences in the<br>presentation of diseases so we can go<br>back to that earlier graphic of what<br>we're common diseases and we see there's<br>a lot of similarities so we see the<br>atrial fibrillation heart disease is<br>more common the benign prostatic<br>hyperplasia that affects men is more is<br>actually more common in those that don't<br>have a care partner while kidney disease<br>one of those most common diseases much<br>higher than the population average we<br>have lung disease the chronic<br>obstructive pulmonary disease<br>depressions very common nearly 1/3 of<br>the the people have depression as well<br>as heart failure being much higher than<br>the population average nearly half of<br>the people have heart failure and then<br>another heart disease called ischemic<br>heart disease and then we've also see<br>far more people have had strokes that<br>have care partners so this is very small<br>and and so don't worry about the numbers<br>and just go tell you what these this<br>slide means so we're we're trying to see<br>if having a care partner helps you<br>maintain some function so what we found<br>was and this just came out last year<br>chronic kidney disease worsens your<br>function as does depression and heart<br>failure however having a Care Partner<br>all of these are negative signs so that<br>means that they all actually reduce a<br>negative effect of the diseases so let<br>me try and show you this in another way<br>because figures are nicer than<br>numbers so here we can look at not<br>having a Care Partner if you have<br>chronic kidney disease and this is a<br>risk ratio so weighting greatly<br>increases the amount of risk you of have<br>of having more functional disabilities<br>if you do have a Care Partner you're<br>less likely to have as as much<br>depression we see a similar where those<br>that are absent much higher risk than<br>those who have a Care Partner so that<br>care partners doing a number of<br>different things and a heart failure<br>again absent we see it's higher than<br>when the Care Partner is present so care<br>partners are not and these were very<br>simply defined right this was attending<br>a medical consultation generally with<br>the GP or a specialist and helping take<br>prescribe medications that's it that's<br>the only thing we were defining it on so<br>then we were also looked at were there<br>socio demographic factors are<br>characteristics of caregivers that were<br>determinants of rest home and mission<br>and we're modeling this at the same time<br>as those functional limitations because<br>some earlier work said when the person<br>can't do these functions that's why they<br>end up in the rest home but we're saying<br>well is it also characteristics of that<br>relationship between the Care Partner<br>the caregiver and the care recipient and<br>one of the things that we found very<br>interesting is if you looked at people<br>who in the u.s. who use long term<br>services to support their disabilities<br>those who are non elderly are<br>predominantly in the community while<br>those who are seniors over on the left<br>side you see they they are about 50/50<br>being in rest homes and receiving<br>community<br>a scare so there's a real question of<br>even though these are nearly the same<br>amount of people nearly two million in<br>each group in the u.s. we're better at<br>providing services for younger people to<br>stay in the community than we are for<br>older people so these are just some<br>characteristics of the people we were<br>studying and again this is from that<br>generalizable group to the US and so I'm<br>just gonna bring your attention if I can<br>make this point to kind of the the Khoa<br>cohabitation status is your living<br>status so of those who were eventually<br>admitted to the rest home this column we<br>have about 48 percent that we're living<br>alone and 26 percent with a partner<br>living with others was only about six<br>percent and living with a partner or<br>others was also very low when we look at<br>some characteristics of those who were<br>admitted to a rest home over here we can<br>see about a third had dementia compared<br>to about 21 percent who did not we saw<br>that they were send their function over<br>time they had worse self-rated health<br>chronic conditions but when we look at<br>those who had a caregiver at any point<br>we can see that of those who went to<br>arrest home 20 percent had a paid<br>caregiver because at some point some<br>individuals have such needs that<br>families are paying out of pocket in the<br>u.s. I think you may have a better<br>health care system here but we often<br>have to pay out of pocket for caregiving<br>those who had a medically supportive<br>caregiver or what we've been calling a<br>Care Partner about 62 percent did fewer<br>had a partner caregiver child care<br>givers both groups had over 90% of<br>people whether they went to a rest home<br>or not had a child caregiver so again<br>that sandwich generation taking care of<br>kids taking care of parents friends and<br>neighbors you know it's really maybe<br>surprising in the u.s. context by 26 and<br>over 30 percent of just friends and<br>neighbors as a caregiver I think in and<br>groups in New Zealand you have much more<br>community support and extended family<br>than possibly in the u.s. if we had<br>looked at any type of family caregiver<br>almost a hundred percent 90 over 98<br>percent and often we have multiple<br>caregivers sources so what did we find<br>out so in this group 11 percent a little<br>over 11 percent went to a rest home<br>you should tell you something about<br>American rest homes and how we pay for<br>them very interesting you won't want to<br>do this so how do you get into one well<br>you better go to a hospital and be<br>admitted for three days not two days not<br>one day and not for observation you have<br>to be admitted for three or more days<br>then you can be discharged and for 20<br>days our insurance plan will pay a<br>hundred percent at day 21 it starts<br>declining until day a hundred where it's<br>$0 until a whole calendar year has<br>happened or you spend another three days<br>admitted to the hospital so what do you<br>think happens<br>the most common length of nursing home<br>stay in the u.s. is 20 days going to the<br>hospital is really costly and we're<br>going to see a few numbers on that in a<br>few minutes but think about this<br>gatekeeping system that requires you to<br>go back to the hospital to get that<br>refreshed that might not be a very<br>economically efficient system so<br>when we looked at some of these values<br>we found that those who go to the rest<br>home had three times greater worsening<br>in their functional status that nearly<br>everyone over or nearly 93 percent had a<br>caregiver at some point and we saw<br>factors that were associated with rest<br>home was going having a low level of<br>education while it was protective in the<br>u.s. sitting setting if you lived with a<br>partner or you lived with other people<br>also the number of caregivers oddly you<br>think more caregivers the better but<br>we're finding is you start to get sort<br>of fractured care because as the number<br>of caregivers went up it actually<br>increased your risk of going to a rest<br>home as well as worsening functional<br>status when we started to look at the<br>characteristics of the the care<br>providers then we saw if you had a<br>medically supportive caregiver you<br>actually were increasing your risk of<br>going to a care home so this really<br>seems to be a marker that the person's<br>struggling to take care of their own<br>medical needs so someone else is having<br>to help with that well again that<br>partner caregiver is protective no<br>effect of the child caregiver no effect<br>of neighbor these are protective but<br>they're not in statistically significant<br>but there could be some some information<br>there so let's get back to our focus of<br>that older adult and the research to<br>improve the lives of elders so there<br>were some high-priority evidence gaps<br>that were recognized in a publication in<br>the u.s. that helped set research<br>priorities and these were really about<br>service utilization such as hospitals<br>emergency<br>services disease-specific outcomes such<br>as diabetes chronic pain cardiovascular<br>disease depression Falls stroke all<br>those things that we saw were having<br>very large effects earlier in among<br>those who have multiple chronic<br>conditions and in the presence of<br>moderate to severe cognitive impairment<br>so that's where there were research<br>efforts and so we're going to try and<br>address those so you have a beautiful<br>hospital here at BER blood I'm really<br>lucky to be based there with dr. J<br>Manson and his group for a month I've<br>only been here a few days and it's been<br>an excellent experience and so as we<br>think about hospitalizations I wanted to<br>examine the associations between these<br>chronic conditions and costs because in<br>the US and we're capitalists we care<br>about costs among people with cognitive<br>impairment in two or more of these<br>chronic conditions because you know that<br>poor management of those chronic<br>conditions they're going to exacerbate<br>and they're either going to have to seek<br>care and the emergency services or be<br>hospitalized that that hospitalization<br>is a marker for kind of poor health<br>management and also in the u.s. setting<br>at least kind of poor care coordination<br>because our handoffs sometimes people<br>fall through the cracks during those<br>care transitions so again we have our n<br>hats folks<br>we're looking over five years of<br>longitudinal data the 21% discontinued<br>when someone goes into a a rest home in<br>this status that we no longer follow<br>them so about 21% were discontinued<br>because they're in a rest home and<br>nearly half the people died these people<br>are are are old and sick we can see that<br>nearly 29%<br>have six or more conditions and and they<br>all have cognitive impairment so these<br>are risk of going to the hospital for<br>each condition and then these are costs<br>and these are rates so let me tell you a<br>little bit about how to read this so in<br>acute myocardial infarction is having<br>had a heart attack right really<br>increases your risk this is having a<br>previous heart attack not the reason you<br>went to the hospital having had one in<br>the past really increases your risk of<br>going to the hospital<br>in u.s. dollars just the cost of the<br>hospitalizations going to be over 23,000<br>u.s. dollars<br>relative to those who did not previously<br>have a heart attack what is the rate so<br>what's a rate it's like it's like it's<br>like a speed in a car right hundred<br>hundred kilometers per hour so this is<br>you're going to have a hundred and<br>twenty six persons admitted who've had a<br>previous heart attack<br>for every hundred persons per year so<br>that means some of these people are<br>going more than once right<br>so this is a big indicator of people<br>with dementia and multiple chronic<br>conditions what else do we find atrial<br>fibrillation I seem to keep repeating<br>myself it's a bad disease don't get it<br>over thirteen thousand dollars ninety<br>one per hundred person years they're<br>almost all going to the hospital every<br>year we see that chronic kidney disease<br>only about $13,000 ninety-eight per<br>hundred persons what else do we have<br>heart failure no good don't get it<br>depression ischemic heart disease<br>rheumatoid are in osteoarthritis so from<br>that very first top ten chronic<br>conditions we can see this poor man in<br>his camera he's decided to chase me<br>around<br>so you can see those top 10 these are<br>not rare conditions and these are costly<br>their frequent hospitalizations and so<br>if we're trying to target things and can<br>we move that to ambulatory care we can<br>start to focus on things now that was<br>direct cost and you might say we have<br>this great Health Scheme here so you<br>know the government pays I don't know<br>how your government makes money but ours<br>in the US taxes the people so I'm paying<br>but look at this those blue lines are<br>direct medical costs that's not just a<br>hospital that's your GP visit that's all<br>the cost your medical devices XY and Z<br>these are our diseases everything just<br>got more expensive because I have a lot<br>more healthcare costs but look at the<br>societal costs what is societal societal<br>is counting the hours that were reported<br>by informal caregivers for just those<br>six activities not going to the doctor's<br>visits not cooking not cleaning not<br>doing everything else they do just those<br>six activities how much time they spent<br>and suddenly you take something like<br>atrial fibrillation that direct medical<br>costs were only around thirty five<br>thousand US dollars and now it's about<br>fifty five thousand US dollars so that<br>hidden cost of informal unpaid<br>caregiving that most of you either are<br>doing or you will do or you have done<br>that is a real cost and that is the<br>importance of providing these social<br>services and well-being supports and all<br>the ways that you try and connect your<br>people with dementia or multiple chronic<br>conditions or all elders to services and<br>why that's so important so we also<br>looked at you say well hospitalization<br>that's pretty intense you know what<br>about just emergency services so we<br>looked at that too<br>and we call it oddly enough treat and<br>release it sounds like you're catching<br>fish and letting them go but you know<br>you are you're catching old sick people<br>and letting them go and so we wanted to<br>look at well were those conditions<br>different right for for those people for<br>emergency visits so again you're getting<br>really good at this we're generalizing<br>to about 3.6 million older Americans<br>they all have at least the two<br>conditions and they all have possible or<br>probable dementia and remember these are<br>sick people nearly 30% had six or more<br>conditions over 35% were over 85 years<br>old these are very vulnerable complex<br>patients about 94 percent had more more<br>than one informal caregiver and nearly<br>70 percent are helping with those<br>medical visits so here the picture is a<br>little different and I want you to think<br>remember what really happens you have an<br>acute event you're sent to the emergency<br>department from there they adjudicate<br>you have to be admitted or can you go<br>home so we're looking at the people that<br>can be treated and be able to go back to<br>their home in this which is different<br>than we saw for the hospitalization so<br>here and so these we can think could<br>this have could this care have occurred<br>in the clinic the GP practice or<br>clinical setting as opposed to having to<br>use emergency services which are very<br>disruptive to the person's life and so<br>here we can see chronic kidney disease<br>we keep hearing about that depression<br>heart failure the ischemic heart disease<br>and the rheumatoid and osteo arthritis<br>so a lot of very painful conditions<br>offering that pain is driving the person<br>to seek help and so we can also see that<br>these rates again still remain pretty<br>high so whether<br>being admitted to the hospital or their<br>seeking emergency services in the u.s.<br>they can be very high and this this just<br>came out this month in the American<br>Journal of emergency medicine so I'm<br>just going to kind of summarize what<br>we've been talking about so the panel<br>has time to have an open discussion with<br>you one of the things we need to kind of<br>focus on in this is the caregivers<br>aren't really getting support in the<br>u.s. to understand the activities they<br>need to do to provide care to their care<br>recipient that person with dementia with<br>multiple conditions we know that the<br>symptom presentation may be different<br>for a person with cognition how they're<br>expressing the symptoms how somebody<br>might recognize them and that that<br>really hasn't been embedded in any sort<br>of caregiver support programs they're<br>starting to develop videos and some<br>other resources in the US but it's the<br>caregiver has really been kind of left<br>behind in providing the care and they're<br>really doing the bulk of the everyday<br>care of that person and so when we look<br>at what are really the activities there<br>they're doing we see that they had<br>nearly 8% are giving shots or injections<br>you're thinking about things around<br>diabetes and some other medications<br>managing medical tasks helping with skin<br>wounds over 20% are helping with skin<br>care older people skin can get very<br>frail and can tear so there's a lot of<br>needs for skin care our insurance<br>practices are complicated thank goodness<br>I hope yours are easier but many of<br>these conditions require a special diet<br>so over 27% are having to have special<br>diets and here<br>nearly 50% are having to keep track of<br>medications<br>it can be really complex than medication<br>regimes if you look at what pill you're<br>supposed to take it what time before a<br>meal after a meal that you know you have<br>to have a complex pill minder when<br>you're taking 15 or more medications at<br>different times of the day it can be the<br>older adults complain that just managing<br>their medical conditions is a full-time<br>job<br>it's taking them away from their social<br>activities they're feeling more isolated<br>and suddenly we're giving drug after a<br>drug to treat the side effects of the<br>previous drug so it's very complex that<br>over around 55 percent are helping speak<br>to that medical provider and over 60<br>percent are helping with medical<br>appointments so these care givers are<br>doing a lot of medical activities of<br>which we find they need more support and<br>so with that I don't want to leave you<br>in a negative space these things are<br>related we have found that care partners<br>can actually improve function for some<br>conditions we believe some conditions<br>can be managed better an ambulatory<br>setting in your GP practices and not<br>necessarily have to go through emergent<br>care or in some cases hospitalizations<br>if they can be stabilized that although<br>dementia may not have a direct treatment<br>there's many supports and services both<br>to the person living with dementia and<br>their caregiver and that this all<br>affects the person's ability to live at<br>home as long as possible and again I'm<br>going to leave you with this slide this<br>is from your own Ministry of Health it<br>has nine key areas to approve the<br>quality of life for people with dementia<br>I know that New Zealand is very<br>committed to this and I think you have a<br>lot of promises to keep growing these<br>services<br>and thank you very much for your<br>intention</p></main><footer
