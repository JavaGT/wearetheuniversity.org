Frugality and moderation are the cornerstone notions for reducing consumption and production under the concept of post-growth. The challenges that landscape architects face today are to build for a better future, ensuring a better quality of the spaces in which we live and the well-being of its users while respecting existing values and introducing restrictions on the use of non-renewable materials.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>all right so now whom I had in mind tena<br>koe tu tena koe tu tena koe tu plan to<br>Allah not me he knew a cook to pass away<br>it's a pleasure to welcome you to these<br>lecture and thank you thank you for<br>inviting me to introduce Chris so<br>creates Christopher Christopher and<br>Herrmann is our visiting scholar in<br>landscape architecture and he is<br>visiting us from barso University of<br>Life Sciences in Poland from the Faculty<br>of civil and environmental engineering<br>where he also obtained his PhD in<br>landscape architecture while studying at<br>Harvard Graduate School of Design<br>as the robot fellow so I never pressured<br>a pleasure to know creates for about 15<br>years by now we're almost there it seems<br>it was yesterday Chris<br>so his research and professional<br>interests includes low budget frugal<br>design strategies temporary lance<br>tactical urbanism community<br>participation and well being an aging of<br>urban environments apart from being the<br>scholar cranes also reminds deeply<br>involved in a profession of landscape<br>architecture through his conceptual<br>designs at double xca of our so based<br>architectural office he is also one of<br>the founders of on-site and NGO that<br>works with local communities and senior<br>citizens to create better urban<br>environments so the talk that he's about<br>to present as relaxing and a nice title<br>for Galatea and moderation is the key<br>values in landscape architecture in the<br>face of climate crisis it looks at how<br>landscape architect's can address issues<br>pertaining to climate crisis as well as<br>responsible and we need to use of<br>resources reflecting as well the<br>international climate for reducing our<br>own carbon footprint through changes and<br>materials design practice travel in<br>operations trees we'll be presenting as<br>different approach<br>to further design including upcycling in<br>low-budget strategies as part of a<br>research project that he carried out at<br>the University of Algarve in Portugal my<br>home country as well as and the case<br>studies from his hometown bar so the<br>capital poland so please join me to give<br>a warm welcome to crease Thank You Bruno<br>it's a pleasure to be here in New<br>Zealand at Victoria Victoria University<br>of Wellington this is a little bit<br>different than I expected<br>I was supposed to be here for three<br>months now I'm staying for six but I<br>feel it's a great place to be right now<br>and I'm happy to be here and happy to<br>present today so yes I'll be talking<br>about frugality and moderation as key<br>values in landscape architecture in the<br>face of climate crisis and I think this<br>is even more relevant now because of the<br>situation in the pandemic and economic<br>crisis that will hit us as well<br>unfortunately so this adds to the value<br>of the frugality and motivation as those<br>those key elements in practicing<br>landscape landscape architecture so I'll<br>start with my hometown and I will move<br>to other places but I'll keep keep<br>around were so a lot this is actually<br>part of my town is Vistula River which<br>sorry biggest river in Warsaw and it'll<br>be the largest liver river in Poland and<br>it goes through the middle of Warsaw and<br>has relatively urban bank Boulevard on<br>one side and rather wild and natural<br>sides which is the right side the Prague<br>a district which is also very urban but<br>the area<br>right by the by by the water the banks<br>are quite natural obviously this is not<br>nature this is the fourth nature this is<br>the urban nature this is what grew on<br>the rubbles of Warsaw that was destroyed<br>during the second world war war so<br>during the second world war was<br>destroyed in 85 to 90 percent the urban<br>fabric was just basically gone so the<br>rubble is a lot of the rubbles remain<br>and this riparian forest grew on top of<br>those rebels and the river used still<br>floods this this area but it's a now a<br>popular spot for people of war so to be<br>and actually right now I'm talking about<br>climate climate crisis the climate<br>change<br>we see the lowest levels and the river<br>and it's unprecedented that during<br>springtime when usually we saw very high<br>levels we have less than half a meter of<br>water in some points and you can walk<br>through the river mmm the bare food and<br>it's just very scary how low the river<br>is there was no snow in war so for the<br>last couple of winters so the melting<br>snow is not adding to the body of water<br>and yeah anyway so the left side of the<br>river is very urban and developed and<br>has been developed the last 10 years RS<br>Arras landscape architects the leading<br>company and in Poland has won the Cup in<br>competition open competition and<br>developed the bank's boulevards on that<br>side bringing the city much closer to<br>the river generally over the years up<br>until the laughs maybe last 8 years this<br>river and the areas around the river has<br>been seen as we<br>very dangerous play place and not a lot<br>of people use the area both banks of the<br>river but with these projects this one<br>and the ones that I will show in a<br>second that has changed tremendously<br>actually the office that I work with the<br>wxc a architects has won the competition<br>for the second stage of the boulevard<br>projects and this is rendering of part<br>of this part of this project and both<br>stages of the design were mmm you know<br>multi-million dollar projects and this<br>was supposed to be quite expensive as<br>well and right now we know already even<br>before the coronavirus the pandemic we<br>knew that city will probably not build<br>this in the shape and form of the<br>competition winning entry now that the<br>crisis will hit hit after panic we are<br>sure and 100% sure that this will not be<br>built at all in the next few years but<br>the other side of the river is is where<br>I would like to focus on right now and<br>this is a very low budget project<br>actually it was never designed but the<br>head of the greenery department matic<br>people water-ski has developed this very<br>simple path on this side which took the<br>goal in the aim of this path was to<br>activate this area and let people just<br>actively use this this space so it was<br>never designed because it was done and<br>created while carrying some of the<br>invasive species there are mostly<br>boxelder maple that was not native to<br>the to the riparian for forest and was<br>over growing some of the other species<br>and it's obviously a permeable surface<br>and<br>there's the orders made of a seam very<br>simple simple design and it's obviously<br>quite resilient to the flooding<br>situation the changing levels the levels<br>of water but is it became chairman<br>tremendously popular with users with<br>people of Warsaw<br>we're so a city of three million people<br>we have quite a lot of green spaces but<br>this is unique green space right on the<br>banks of the of the river and people<br>love to use it and there's not much else<br>it's just it's just the path so in the<br>face of have to sorry would like to move<br>your faces because I can't read okay so<br>in the face of climate crisis<br>responsible limited use of resources has<br>became of paramount importance for gala<br>tea and moderation are the cornerstones<br>and notions for reducing consumption and<br>production under the concept of post<br>growth so we know that we can't continue<br>growth right right the current economic<br>model is not sustainable we can growing<br>forever and ever we have to plan for<br>other situations and maybe the growth is<br>not not not sustainable and actually the<br>International Federation of landscape<br>architects have put forth this<br>declaration for climate and biodiversity<br>emergency and they called for reducing<br>our own carbon footprints through<br>changes in materials design practice<br>travel and operation so in everyday<br>practice and the way we approach things<br>we have to think about this frugality<br>and we the way we use resources and that<br>has not been the case for landscape<br>architects and architects mostly because<br>architects system is are much stronger<br>as a profession in Poland<br>and so I was born in early 80s in wersal<br>during the martial law and it was empty<br>shelves in the stores there was was very<br>kind of great period of time strikes and<br>you know throughout my early childhood<br>the frugality was wasn't the norm but<br>actually start of my professional career<br>and and my 20s and 30s mmm<br>we're doing the best times possibly the<br>best farms in Polish history when Poland<br>joined to European Union in 2004 and the<br>last 15 years were times of<br>unprecedented prosperity and the money<br>that came from you from European Union<br>was used for a lot of infrastructure<br>projects it actually helped build roads<br>it helps to develop build bridges and<br>also builds a lot of public spaces in<br>Polish towns and the architects of the<br>older generations the architects the age<br>of my parents had very different<br>concerns - what's my generations of<br>landscape architects and architects have<br>they were concerned with modernization<br>and approach that led to these kind of<br>projects that are shown here this is in<br>Polish because this is a mean from<br>popular internet website that show a<br>town square before and after<br>revitalization that costed six point<br>three million dollars water which is<br>roughly 1.5 million euro and this is<br>just one example and there's way more<br>examples like that actually town squares<br>and market squares and most of Polish<br>towns during the history and a lot of<br>those towns have quite old history you<br>know built in the medieval times they<br>were places of gathering their places of<br>free market<br>before the Second World War and after<br>the Second World War during the<br>communist regime obviously the<br>government didn't want to have free<br>markets they controlled markets so<br>places like market squares were not used<br>all the sales in the market moved into<br>state controlled shops also the freedom<br>of gathering was not well the government<br>wanted to control gather means they<br>didn't want any protests so a lot of<br>those stone town squares changed into<br>green spaces and that was prevalent and<br>apparent in many many towns in in Poland<br>but in 2000's and up until now really a<br>lot of money went into the public domain<br>and the for design of public spaces and<br>the architects decided to go back and<br>restore this space as a spacious space<br>of meetings and events and markets and<br>that required in their opinion required<br>this cutting down of most of the<br>greenery making square town squares<br>quite concrete build out of concrete or<br>stone and with some maybe water features<br>and you can see before after in many<br>many places small towns larger towns<br>that those green squares were using this<br>money from European Union turned into<br>those concrete squares that sometimes<br>have some events concerts once every<br>half a year or during the New Year Eve<br>celebration and actually this became a<br>big issue right now and it's very viral<br>there's a hashtag battle Nosa which is<br>the hashtag the concrete trending last<br>year on Facebook and Twitter and people<br>would show examples from their places<br>how<br>the money from European Union and public<br>money is being used to create those<br>spaces that are not sustainable and<br>they're not looking the way we would<br>like to have them when we're thinking<br>about heat islands in the cities and<br>permeable surfers and basically all the<br>challenges that we face during the<br>crisis climate crisis<br>so how sure landscape architecture<br>practice respond to the needed frugality<br>and design can low low budget low impact<br>low fruit footprint and informal green<br>spaces be attractive in inviting for the<br>users I looked at exhibition an<br>exhibition catalogue that was published<br>few years ago<br>and it looked that the catalog presented<br>best projects from the cigarette<br>countries which is Hungary Czech<br>Republic Slovakia and Poland and this is<br>what landscape architect's wants to show<br>to the world and this is what they want<br>to see as the best practice one of the<br>elements in this catalog was price tag<br>it was every every project hence had his<br>price tag and how much money was put<br>into developing this project so out of<br>the 40 featured public designs most of<br>them in public spaces only four had a<br>budget lower than 50 thousand euro at<br>the same time half of them had budget of<br>more than million euro the average cost<br>for all the 40 exhibited projects<br>because it was 10 projects from each<br>country was 1.9 so this is this goes<br>with I think the history of our<br>profession exhibiting and showing and<br>looking at the rather grand projects<br>then bed this is what we like to share<br>with other people like the projects that<br>are quite expensive and visually very<br>attractive but maybe it's time to<br>he invents the way we think about our<br>profession and example was actually in<br>this catalog examples from Czech<br>Republic are quite interesting and<br>showing how Landscape Architecture can<br>be different there were three or four<br>three projects that were very cheap and<br>one of them was just a community<br>engagement project that was all about<br>cleaning up the landscape in the village<br>this action of reducing the amount of<br>garbage around there their village and<br>also planting some trees and putting on<br>some benches so very very simple simple<br>actions this is obviously I would like<br>to have maybe just grass a little bit<br>longer here but this is a very simple<br>project as well from the city where a<br>small budget was used just to add some<br>trees and answer at some benches or this<br>very kind of critical<br>maybe more like land or landscape art<br>projects when the artists took elements<br>from fences actually different samples<br>of fences from around the village and<br>created this very low budget space for<br>meetings with the use of this the<br>samples of the fences here's no I joined<br>very interesting workshop in Hamburg and<br>the HafenCity university that was called<br>what's the value of saving costs the<br>urban economics and policies of every<br>day's saving practices and actually we<br>published this book called saving the<br>city and I with my article and it's that<br>was called low budget design in in<br>landscape landscape architecture and<br>when during this workshop we lived in a<br>very interesting space that I will show<br>in a second but the idea behind this<br>that this workshop that lasted for<br>two weeks was to look at social<br>practices such as urban gardening car<br>sharing co-working and food cooperatives<br>ticket sharing and wise waste recycling<br>as trends to organize the city<br>differently often the descriptions of<br>these accounts are discursively linked<br>to the economic reality of austerity<br>politics and impending threat of<br>resource scarcity and demographic change<br>in large cities of Canterbury welfare<br>societies which seem to prompt many<br>people to develop innovative alternative<br>or entrepreneurial ways of coping of the<br>challenges of the old order of the day<br>these practices of urban dwellers show<br>re-evaluation of the notion of scarcity<br>waste and consumption collective way of<br>organizing a low budget and appreciate<br>appreciation of slower simple self<br>organized and local ways of producing<br>and consuming now we looked at upcycling<br>and upcycling is a way of using products<br>and materials and adding value so you<br>take a product and through design you<br>don't use too much material but you make<br>something into a higher quality project<br>so it's it's something more than<br>recycling right we lived in the space<br>built by an architecture students from -<br>City University in Hamburg and it was an<br>old unused house that was partially safe<br>to live in and so the students actually<br>did check checks on the construction of<br>the building they checked which parts of<br>the building they could use and their<br>unusable parts was over built if that's<br>the right word to use with the<br>scaffolding and actually the scaffolding<br>became kind of a hotel for them for the<br>summer and students would build their<br>own kind of little cubicles like in the<br>hotels in Japan places to sleep and<br>where the temperatures is higher in the<br>summer months they would<br>sleep there and the sleeping Saxons<br>build this space while they live in it<br>and learn and classes would be held<br>there as well we had those we have the<br>workshops while building this space from<br>reused materials mostly now meanwhile we<br>were building space around it with very<br>low budget materials and the space in<br>the park and the elements would be used<br>by local residents who often joined us<br>to cook meals in this impromptu mates<br>kind of temporary culture center that<br>was in the middle of the park there was<br>there's interesting manifesto put on<br>last year by French architects that is<br>my manifesto for frugality happy and<br>creative fatality and finality they look<br>and finality and energy materials<br>technology territorial buildings they<br>called for raw materials upkeep and<br>maintenance with low tech approaches and<br>that doesn't mean an absence of<br>technology but the use of revelant<br>relevant appropriate non polluting or<br>wasteful techniques along with<br>appliances that are easy to repair<br>recycle and reuse during my stay in<br>Portugal one month stay at the<br>University of Garf I looked at three<br>projects that we build parks that were<br>built after the year 2000 in the city of<br>Pharaoh and one of those projects was<br>part of the others a big park outside of<br>the city that featured football stadium<br>that was built for the Europe that was<br>so now I finish 2004 and in portion of<br>the football Cup and that whole the<br>amount of resources<br>money spent on this was 78 million<br>dollars obviously that included the<br>football stadium but the space around it<br>was quite designed and quite high budget<br>design as well and during my month in<br>Portugal it was a summer month I used to<br>go there pretty much every day I would<br>never see anybody in this huge park it<br>was a space that was totally unused also<br>there was no matches matches held in<br>this Stadium<br>the stadium is not being used as well is<br>used a couple of times a year perhaps if<br>that by the national team mochi brought<br>jiggler Gibraltar and did you brought it<br>doesn't play a lot of football matches<br>internationally it's not a very<br>successful successful team the other<br>project that I looked at was Park very<br>near the fire it was a park on the banks<br>of the water banks the ocean and it was<br>a huge investment as well as the euro<br>included camping grounds and a lot of<br>non permeable surfaces and amphitheater<br>and other elements and it was reasonably<br>used but there was not a lot of use in<br>it as well and the third part that I<br>looked at was was not even a park that<br>this space had never been designed this<br>is the only image of the design that I<br>saw this is the third one on the right<br>this is a space that used to be a gas<br>station but then the gas station was<br>tear down because of legal reasons and<br>it just became an empty space with some<br>grass and the concrete straight concrete<br>path a road that used to be used by the<br>gas station I guess and it's outside of<br>one of the biggest malls in the<br>in the city so it has quite a good<br>location and this park and the pictures<br>nd when I observed it had users every<br>single day there was nothing there<br>basically it was just grass just lawn<br>and outside of this long there was a<br>small pizza restaurant and had<br>tremendous use people are coming up with<br>different ideas how to use it they were<br>bringing their own equipment to comment<br>use this use this space meanwhile the<br>other two spaces that had this huge<br>NSYNC those huge investments had barely<br>been used at all but I didn't stop at<br>just observing the use of those spaces<br>because maybe that's not important maybe<br>there's other values like environmental<br>values that are important in those<br>projects and I asked both experts at the<br>university RF and local landscape<br>architects as well as some residents to<br>tell me how they value those spaces and<br>the third one the very low budget space<br>was very appreciated for most of the<br>impacts this is actually I'm using WH<br>for kind of scheme for researching urban<br>green space the green spaces in looking<br>at environments and lifestyles social<br>equity impacts so it has been the space<br>this very simple space was very<br>appreciated by both experts and the<br>local community even though it has not<br>been really designed so now skip again<br>to Warsaw and another design I was<br>involved with this is plan of Warsaw<br>Central Park called polemic atop skin<br>this park was developed and designed in<br>the 60s in a very modernist way with<br>several sport fields and national<br>library in the middle of the park and a<br>quite large<br>mmm pond or a small lake with a concrete<br>basin in the in the middle of it as well<br>and two years ago there was a national<br>competition for that modernization or<br>revitalization of this Park which is one<br>of the most known well known parks in<br>Poland and the architects that I work<br>with and we won this this competition<br>and we showed how we would like to<br>approach this space first of all this<br>competition was very interesting because<br>to enter this competition you had to<br>read about a thousand pages of reports<br>and one of the largest report was a<br>report from public consultation<br>community consultations that had about<br>200 pages and it was very very long and<br>most of it was all about how people<br>appreciate this space and how they use<br>it a lot and how they really deeply<br>value this space that the other half of<br>the other part of the reports were<br>environmental reports and showing how<br>both flora and fauna the animals are<br>doing very well in that space and the<br>plants are doing very well there's a lot<br>of plant communities there and there's a<br>lot of rare species of animals that are<br>unusual for urban environments in there<br>so we thought we wanted to join this<br>competition but on the other hand we<br>felt not much but not much has to be<br>changed in that Park it was so so well<br>appreciate it so most of our design was<br>or what most of our work on this design<br>was not not design it was just analyzing<br>and looking into the current values of<br>this place so we don't don't break<br>anything don't don't don't make it make<br>the space worse basically by by our<br>design so we looked at how the world of<br>plants and animals<br>interacts the house of nature let's say<br>interacts with the activities of people<br>and how they interfere and so that was<br>that was a lot in our minds creating<br>added value in both biodiversity and<br>possibility of uses in this in this<br>space so the analytical element of this<br>project was quite big and the one thing<br>that we really changed about this area<br>was this I wanted to change about this<br>space was this pond that was like I said<br>concrete base and they used community<br>pipes is that the right word the<br>basically drinkable water to refill this<br>this pond and this obviously had to be<br>changed also the whole water system that<br>was developed in the 60s 70s was based<br>on those concrete rivers that wanted<br>that actually was we're trying to be<br>formed like meandering natural rivers<br>but have been laid out with with with<br>concrete and the company was cracking so<br>the water heard the drinkable water was<br>wasteful waste there was a lot of water<br>waste so we looked at how the world<br>gathers in some parts different parts of<br>the park and we didn't start to design<br>some water features in different places<br>as well the places where the water<br>naturally collects stagnant after after<br>rainfall and what you have to know about<br>Poland is that actually Poland is going<br>through a like I said going through a<br>drought and the drought is very very<br>apparent in the last year's and there's<br>Parsifal and there's being desertified<br>desertified there's problems with water<br>shortages in places already and that's<br>only going to get worse and you can see<br>that because of the climate change<br>there's more extreme rainfall and<br>there's periods of long weeks and months<br>with without rain actually March and<br>April this year there was pretty much no<br>rainfall which is really unusual so then<br>when the rain falls it's a lot of rain<br>so that has changed a lot within the<br>climates of Poland's that used to have<br>that this this picture shows here so<br>many different types of rain this is<br>kind of a research on different types<br>this typology of different types of<br>grading so what we wanted to design<br>their first of all get wanted to get rid<br>of the bed the concrete basin and make<br>more a natural pond with natural<br>filtration and also build in a place of<br>existing small building cafeteria build<br>building that its main function would be<br>to collect rainwater so we can see in<br>this little scheme here that this big<br>roof would be a space of gathering<br>collecting collecting rainwater and<br>rainwater would be moved to the bottom<br>was your collector place that collects<br>the water and actually so during the<br>heavy rainfall and then during droughts<br>and months without rain hot days this<br>would be used as a kind of a water<br>screen a mist fountain that helps with<br>with with the heat one of the elements<br>of the design was to design in this<br>Candice competition was to change area<br>around the national library that used to<br>be that's funny but this is very random<br>but this is how one were so is a lot of<br>random spaces<br>this area just outside of national<br>library for years was workshop for city<br>buses and this is where my city buses<br>were fixed a few years ago that that was<br>moved and there was a big green space<br>great lawn that that was set up there<br>and so we wanted to in this design look<br>at how we want to use this space without<br>building anything adding anything to<br>that so what we proposed for that space<br>was just maintenance and letting the<br>grass grow a little bit longer and kind<br>of a playful arrangement of the grass<br>while cutting it in different different<br>shapes and that would create space that<br>is ephemeral that can change a lot and<br>we can make it a bit more biodiversity<br>few trees but also just having longer<br>longer grass areas with uncut unmown<br>plants but there's also a scheme for<br>actually gathering water on the top of<br>the top of the roof of the building with<br>the national library and making as well<br>temporarily puddles in that area so the<br>last research that I wanted to talk<br>about was me and my co-workers from the<br>West University of Life Science obtained<br>like we got this large grant to look at<br>green wastelands in the in the city<br>believe it or not there is quite a lot<br>of green spaces that are just informal<br>they're kind of they look like this and<br>they are by some water stormwater creeks<br>or train tracks or those are brownfields<br>that post and post industrial sites and<br>they're just overgrown<br>by just kind of wild greenery and those<br>phases in the official plans of Warsaw<br>or wastelands that should be built built<br>over but they actually have quite a lot<br>of environmental value and so forth<br>we're looking at how they change the<br>quality of air and what are the what is<br>the use of those spaces and how people<br>use it as well<br>so my team I worked with psychologists<br>and we used portable EEG devices called<br>muse to look at the emotional well-being<br>of people who used those faces so we<br>went to a lot of those green overgrown<br>wastelands and told people just to sit<br>there and you know not move too much<br>because then the signal is not clear but<br>just kind of relax in this in places<br>like this right or places like this over<br>ground overgrown ruins for example and<br>you want to see if how that differs from<br>actually designed spaces parks you some<br>of the new bye-bye parks as well and we<br>found so far this is still ongoing but<br>we found found so far that there is not<br>much difference that people when it<br>comes to feeling of relaxation feeling<br>of being calm it's similar in both<br>design parks urban parks and those green<br>wastelands or what we call them informal<br>green spaces so we think that those low<br>budgets or those informal green spaces<br>can be easily turned into low budgets<br>urban parks and we see that in places<br>and there's this is I'll give you one<br>example of how that came came about how<br>one of the informal green spaces<br>wastelands became usable park with very<br>small intervention so actually this is<br>old fortification that was just<br>overgrown it's kind of in the outskirts<br>of Warsaw but there is a big development<br>architectural development there there is<br>residential building being built there<br>but and on the outskirts of the<br>fortification that is actually protected<br>because it's 19th century fortification<br>there was still this kind of you know<br>messy wild space that wasn't used too<br>much and what the landscape architects<br>did there was just created a little bit<br>added some stairs simple stairs that<br>allowed to access that space they didn't<br>change that much in the space at all and<br>this space became usable and just added<br>simple elements like this place for<br>growing vegetables community garden and<br>with very few elements they changed this<br>space to be from being unused wastelands<br>with very low budget to being a place<br>that is well used by both newcomers and<br>the people who used to live in that in<br>okay Thank You Becky are you<br>facilitating the next stage I know you<br>need to go as soon maybe I'll leave it<br>to you for the first 5 mins and I'll<br>make it over okay just to say thank you<br>very much Chris for the fantastic talk<br>and it's really cool to see these frugal<br>initiatives making more impact than some<br>of the far more expensive ones that you<br>showed us so thank you very much<br>there's a couple of questions coming<br>through so if I could hand it over to<br>Bruno to facilitate that I just have a<br>class and a couple of minutes so I need<br>to need to zoom off soon but but thank<br>you again for being part of our virtual<br>talk series Thank You Becky okay thank<br>you crease I just want to read right<br>Becky's words and thank you for your<br>lecture and I think was very interesting<br>to see the approach to landscape<br>architecture across Europe and across<br>different countries and someone just<br>wrote on a chat box a question is from<br>German and she's asking just curious<br>regarding your opinion on creating small<br>temporary installation projects in the<br>why to introduce low-cost urban<br>interventions during an economic<br>slowdown specifically in small town<br>urban centers that are heavily resistant<br>so listen interesting and actually me<br>and Bruno with friends started at this<br>special issue for one of the journals on<br>the pandemic urbanism and we we are very<br>curious about approaches and tactical<br>urbanism approaches that are happening<br>right now around<br>world and it's actually to see that this<br>tactical urbanism became became real<br>policy in a lot of towns during this<br>James panting and that you can see that<br>you can do a lot with very little so<br>closing down you know one lane of a<br>street creates so much space for this<br>social distancing there is so many ways<br>of turning especially streets space more<br>pedestrian friendly using very little<br>resources so I am a big fan of urban<br>prototyping I so testing elements in an<br>urban space I think it can be Donald's<br>done also in smaller smaller places so<br>looking into changes that are<br>temporarily you don't want to use too<br>much resources on that but you can with<br>very little research you can you can<br>create a temporary change that you could<br>test and see how people react to it and<br>then you can either back back up a<br>little bit or go forward with the change<br>or kind of negotiates the changes with<br>that if people see the change and the<br>the test is done so people can see how<br>change would influence the space they<br>could they could they could adapt to the<br>change and you can be sometimes<br>surprised that people are more happy<br>with these kind of changes that you<br>thought they would be that's the right I<br>think um was a good answer Thank You<br>cream any other questions from our<br>to any it yourself all right while some<br>people warm up<br>I think craze I have a question for you<br>um so based on your experience of being<br>here in Ottawa New Zealand and what how<br>do you compare the practice of landscape<br>architecture here from what you are used<br>to and how do you see the ideas around<br>low budgets interventions in landscape<br>architecture being used here in the<br>context of New Zealand there's there's<br>quite a few projects that I'd be<br>interested in looking at as as low<br>budget projects I see a lot of just you<br>know simple paths and walks and in the<br>native bush even here in Miramar where I<br>live I I explored a lot of Miramar<br>because we're supposed to stay local so<br>so I saw a lot of pressures that you<br>know just help you with the access to<br>some natural sides but created in a very<br>kind of low-key<br>low-key way and I and I really like it<br>and also I was really interested in how<br>some of the parks here are used and that<br>marks in a Miramar are not like the<br>parts in Warsaw like parks here in the<br>peninsula are just sports grounds<br>basically and they're just big grass<br>fields and right now in the period of<br>social distance things that is so useful<br>I mean those are maybe not the most<br>environmentally friendly spaces there's<br>not much natural vegetation there but<br>for social distancing and staying within<br>your bubble it's interesting to see how<br>people here are innovative with bringing<br>their own equipment because the kids<br>can't play on the playground so they<br>have people here have a lot of their of<br>their own stuff they just bring it in<br>and create those temporary situations<br>and those big sports fields and I have<br>seen so many different<br>types of uses perhaps even more than you<br>thank you and opening again before to<br>anyone that is attending and if there's<br>any questions I think everyone is still<br>digesting or they just don't know how to<br>a mute hi Chris<br>I'm Maria I was really quite interested<br>in the in the big park and Warsaw that<br>you redesigned with others but you<br>really spent a long time understanding<br>and dot make ping and diagramming and<br>communicating the values that were<br>already there and look the good things<br>that were on the site in the site<br>already and that people experienced and<br>valued how what is the state of that<br>project at the moment has it been<br>finished or is it still ongoing or will<br>it be affected by the pandemic no that<br>shouldn't be affected too much actually<br>because the budget was already in place<br>and it was subsidized heavily subsidized<br>by the European Union as well so the<br>municipality has to use that money that<br>project so they have but it's like a lot<br>of projects this was designed in to be<br>built in stages and I think actually<br>some of the things will not be built<br>maybe that's okay because yeah no budget<br>design that I'm so attracted to and but<br>I think some of the crucial things will<br>be built and I'm<br>looking forward to the change of the of<br>the pond and development of some of the<br>playgrounds that we redesigned trying to<br>use the elements that were in there but<br>also making them more natural<br>environments and like expanding them<br>into the park rather than closing them<br>and fencing them off you know being more<br>open spaces that could be more spaces of<br>kids adventure in the park rather than<br>just little bubbles of fenced<br>playgrounds that are there right now so<br>so those are the changes that I really<br>look forward to and that should be built<br>so the playgrounds and the water system<br>that is there that as you're talking<br>eyes I was thinking about you being a<br>father and do you think that that has<br>changed the way you look at you have<br>young children has that change the way<br>you look at the way you design or think<br>about public space I actually first<br>playground I designed I mean I continued<br>designing because obviously on the on<br>the conceptual stage you design<br>playgrounds but then you a lot of times<br>I when I work with the architects I stop<br>at the conceptual stage and on the kind<br>of largest clear and then don't go into<br>detail and this is actually the first<br>time I went in this design and the next<br>stages of preparing the documentation<br>and started designing the playground so<br>so it was great it's it's fast that<br>fascinating and I mean so so much has<br>changed<br>and actually the Bruno in the<br>introduction mentioned that we're<br>running a foundation in Warsaw that is<br>dealing with kind of also temporary<br>interventions and we were asked by the<br>greenery Commission or the department in<br>Warsaw Council to develop temporary<br>playgrounds for once one or two season<br>that only used natural elements that<br>were found in parks so we had this this<br>task and we build several playgrounds we<br>basically only found objects and and<br>it's not natural elements and that was<br>basically building by design by building<br>right and that was quite a successful<br>program I'm saying a lot of those<br>playgrounds even though they don't they<br>they were only supposed to last for a<br>season or two now they are up kept by<br>communities that joint into that so they<br>rebuild those playgrounds and a more<br>permanent even the site is changing<br>those time thank you thank you very nice<br>what is it um you talked about creating<br>a low impact on already kind of rundown<br>spaces what's your opinion on changing<br>these concrete two places back to<br>organic structure do you think this is<br>sustainable kind of so if I may I just<br>can show you do you see this quickly<br>like much you need to so just now can<br>you see this image yeah okay so this is<br>this was a project that we were working<br>on it this is just what you asked about<br>this is a huge concrete area square<br>between two big blocks of flats each<br>about thousand people living in it<br>and this is this is the area that had a<br>very little permeable surface and we<br>went there and wanted to change this<br>space and we build it with we build it<br>with the local community I could talk<br>about it some other time but we did a<br>lot of kind of temporary<br>approaches and testing first and doing<br>things together with the people who live<br>there and one of our main goals was to<br>cut into this concrete and create<br>Islands and actually kids were done in a<br>democratic way voting on the islands on<br>what should be in those islands and we<br>created this program that was cutting<br>through those the concrete and creating<br>little islands like this one for example<br>this is a little vegetable garden that<br>grew in the middle of that concrete<br>field there right or this is a labyrinth<br>with some IVs growing so there's also<br>little islands cut into the concrete so<br>we left the concrete four paths around<br>those islands but actually created a lot<br>of islands that were either places to<br>play or you know places to grow things<br>you can see that a little bit here so<br>yeah I'm really into that and that was<br>was a low-budget project very low budget<br>project alright thank you for this<br>question and any other questions before<br>we wrap these up now<br>okay Chris thank you very much for<br>sharing with us and your amazing work<br>and experience in years on on an<br>alternative way to landscape<br>architecture it is equally valid and<br>exciting</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
