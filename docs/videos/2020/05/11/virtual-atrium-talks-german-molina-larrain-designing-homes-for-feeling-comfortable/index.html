Nonetheless, capturing all the complexity, subjectivity and richness of this construct in models that are useful in building science contexts is far from straightforward. <br><br>By prioritizing usability, several models of comfort (e.g. acoustic, visual and thermal) have oversimplified the concept to a nearly-objective sensation that can be assessed through equations. On the contrary, models that refuse to perform such oversimplifications often reach levels of complexity that make them unusable in practice. <br><br>Based on a set of interviews, this research proposes an analogy between Comfort and Emotions that ultimately leads to a model of the Feeling of Comfort. This model has the advantage of being both usable in building science contexts and of conceptualizing the construct of comfort in a much richer way.<br><br>The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation’s Virtual Atrium Talks are a series of seminars where staff, PhD students, and external design and built environment practitioners present their current research and seek feedback from the community.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>to make a knowledge between comfort and<br>emotions just a quick note I am working<br>with comfort as a general concept but<br>today's examples are going to refer to<br>mostly to thermal comfort and some day<br>lighting mainly because that's the<br>that's my field of expertise and also<br>because that's it that I've gathered so<br>far so the rest of my PhD is gonna be<br>about gathering trying to generalize<br>this idea for other domains of comfort<br>such as acoustics and air quality right<br>so let's talk about comfort every time I<br>say I'm working with comfort the first<br>thing that people tell me is that<br>comfort is subjective like saying that<br>you cannot work with comfort that<br>comfort is a state of the mind but I if<br>I let that stop me I wouldn't do<br>anything so if I if I let the the<br>subjectivity as you stop me we would<br>never do so anything about comfort but<br>we have done some stuff in fact in the<br>70s fine gear proposed one of the first<br>and one of the most popular models of<br>thermal comfort called the rational<br>physiological approach and he basically<br>removed the idea of subjectivity from<br>the comfort equation so he said he model<br>the human body as that's a machine<br>perhaps that exchanges that generates<br>heat and exchanges heat with the<br>environment and from that you can<br>calculate balances and imbalances of<br>heat and I would generate a thermal<br>sensation so feeling cold hot or neutral<br>and it's assumed that if you feel<br>neutral or close to neutral your comfort<br>right the problem with this model is<br>that is developed in a lab and it<br>doesn't work well all the time so<br>there's paper published in 2019 they<br>said that two or three times is wrong<br>I'm not sure if this is fair I don't<br>think finders model was developed for<br>predicting individuals thermal sensation<br>I think it's about having a general idea<br>of what would groups of people think but<br>anyway still it's not a good predictor<br>necessarily and that's something that we<br>didn't have to wait to until 2019 to<br>know that people in the so-called<br>adaptive approach to thermal comfort<br>they've been saying that comfort this in<br>the mind of the beholder for years this<br>is the actually the title of a<br>conference paper published by<br>year and some colleagues and he is one<br>of the probably one of the most<br>remarkable proponents of the adaptive<br>approach to thermal comfort in this<br>paper he explains what this approach<br>does it says a person same with thermal<br>history an adaptation level including<br>behavioral psychological and<br>physiological processes operating at<br>various temperatures about their time<br>skills also influence thermal comfort<br>right so instead of starting from the<br>idea that thermal sensation is the only<br>driver for comfort the adaptive model<br>says that comfort is a state of the map<br>which is great but then in the same<br>paper he explains how research is done<br>usually we said that the basic research<br>design is to gather paired observations<br>of objective in diplomatic parameters<br>and comfort rating scales which is<br>basically Likert scales so asking them<br>whether they feel comfortable where they<br>feel neutral or not now<br>changed to 2020 Richard the dear<br>partisan hamburger all great researchers<br>in this field they say the same thing<br>the analysis they're doing is by<br>calculating thermal neutral T's which<br>are assumed to be comfort temperatures<br>again and correlating that to indoor air<br>temperatures<br>so what's the mistake that I see here is<br>that first we're assuming again that<br>thermal neutral --'tis so feeling<br>neither cold nor hot is Comfort which<br>some even even adapted thermal comfort<br>boots said it's it's not true and that<br>we're trying to predict something that<br>depends on human psychology based only<br>on indoor air temperatures so just as<br>fungus said you know basically between<br>20 and 25 degrees you should feel<br>comfortable these models are saying in<br>the end when you see the result is in<br>winter 20 degrees or right in summer 25<br>it's all right<br>so the psychology is sort of removed or<br>hidden and therefore this is all almost<br>and I'm stretching this a little bit but<br>this is almost a saying as comfortable<br>it's a physiological phenomena and<br>and this is a contradiction I see this<br>as a contradiction that it's everywhere<br>Ellucian so July 97 published a small<br>book that is in the library I want to<br>reread it because the contradictions<br>just to evidence they say physiological<br>neutrality does not necessarily mean<br>comfort so comfort is a state of the<br>mind and then they say in page three of<br>the same book<br>Comfort is the minimization of<br>physiological responses saying that<br>this is a post in LinkedIn I removed the<br>picture and the name of who posted it<br>but it's a natural distinguished<br>lecturer he says that comfort is a<br>perception formulated by the brain which<br>is great conferences then a state of the<br>mind but then in the same paragraph says<br>that when people say they're cold it's<br>cold in here what they're saying is that<br>heat is living their body at a rate<br>greater than it can be replaced so no<br>state of the mind at all in the end then<br>there's a book published being 20/20<br>saying that the roots of thermal comfort<br>are based upon physiology an equally<br>important psychology so then again<br>comfort is the state of the mind but<br>then the thermal comfort fractures<br>don't include any psychological element<br>so there's tension in the in the field<br>of comfort if you want to at least in<br>thermal comfort and visual comfort it's<br>sort of the same idea between this idea<br>of comfort being a state of the mind in<br>principle but in practice never is and I<br>see and I've heard teachers and<br>professors complaining how students or<br>industry stick to the numbers and stick<br>to the temperature and forget that<br>comfort is the state of the mind but the<br>truth is that our guidelines are models<br>for calculating don't really reflect the<br>state of the mind part of comfort now<br>these two different paradigms which are<br>contradicting I mean they they shouldn't<br>exist together but they do and the<br>reason for that I think it's very simple<br>every time we do mathematical modeling<br>of anything we simplify the world right<br>so since there is no really an absolute<br>standard for thermal comfort but we know<br>that in general comfort occurs when<br>physiological effort regulation is<br>minimized we'll take that as a proxy for<br>comfort effect will be effectively<br>removing all the subjectivity from the<br>matter almost all now this is a<br>daylighting core actually christopher<br>ryan hart saying that there is a fear<br>that quality assessment of the space for<br>instance the visual interest of the<br>space leaves too much room for<br>subjective interpretation and i think<br>this may be the reason why psychology is<br>removed from these models because<br>there's a fear that subjectivity will<br>lead to an infinite rabbit hole<br>rendering all these models and usable<br>because they're just too complex but I<br>don't think subjectivity necessarily<br>means chaos subjectivity implies that<br>people are entitled to like something<br>and you can not tell them they're really<br>wrong but it doesn't mean that there's<br>no consensus so for instance people may<br>be entitled to liked the rooms to be at<br>five degrees Celsius at night they just<br>don't they rarely do the same way people<br>may like windows with rooms with no<br>windows<br>or triangular doors and furs that are<br>non-flat or whatever right<br>the world is much more much less Cowell<br>taking all sorts of subjective things<br>and for some reason comforts always<br>treat us no we can't work with that we<br>need to reduce it to oversimplify to<br>something that it's thermodynamics or in<br>the case of visual comfort we work with<br>contrast and we work with the is<br>essentially instead of asking people or<br>working with the psychology so the<br>propositions for this presentation and<br>I'm not sure if these are going to be<br>the propositions in my thesis but are<br>that given that comfort is subjective<br>experience everyone says that in<br>principle every book of uncomfort says<br>that in principle then it cannot be<br>limited to physiological sensations such<br>as glare and daylight's efficiency or<br>contrast or thermal thermal sensation<br>therefore I would propose a current<br>models cannot properly represent comfort<br>real comfort which is sort of obvious<br>because we out making simplifications<br>the second proposition is that embracing<br>psychology and subjectivity can help<br>solving this which is also obvious like<br>adding more complexity to a model<br>usually improves it if you do it<br>properly and the third one is II I think<br>my contribution is that despite being<br>subjective comfort might be the<br>consequence of our relatively small and<br>therefore manageable number of factors I<br>will try to show you that third part in<br>this presentation so I did some research<br>which meant interviews this is already<br>somehow new in building science we tend<br>to not ask things to people we tend to<br>give them small questionnaires that I<br>can answer Likert scales so we can use<br>numbers but I just let them talk I<br>interviewed so far eighteen people nine<br>from New Zealand nine from Chile nine<br>male and female and so on and so forth<br>all of them had purchased a house<br>recently I was looking for people who<br>had searched for houses but they all<br>happen to already what I want and what I<br>asked him to I mean the only<br>question of this interview was to<br>describe a warm house to describe a<br>house with good natural light and from<br>that description I extracted the<br>following ideas<br>first of all comfort in residential<br>settings it's a goal in itself it's not<br>a means to anything people don't want to<br>be comfortable to be productive at home<br>they don't want to be comfortable not<br>even to save money they want to become<br>fertile just because they want to feel<br>comfortable it's a matter of quality of<br>life I cannot put my finger in anything<br>different a cold house is just<br>uncomfortable on a warm house in the<br>winter more than any other season is<br>give you a surplus our well-being<br>surplus that you appreciate you actually<br>want to get to a warm house and and this<br>quote also reveals something that is<br>interesting that comfort when you<br>approach comfort from a physiological or<br>a thermal sensation point of view if you<br>want it's always negative or neutral so<br>the best house you can aspire is a not<br>bad house and not uncomfortable house<br>because every physiological response<br>implies discomfort so the best you can<br>be is relaxed if you want in this case<br>this person is revealing that day a<br>comfort is positive you want to get to<br>along house it's not as it's not just<br>and then I I get there in the evening<br>this person was talking about a house in<br>Mount Victoria that he wanted he didn't<br>have but he said I can read a book or<br>drink a beer with the Sun over me right<br>now he doesn't want the Sun to be able<br>to read them he just wants the Sun<br>reading a book is just an example he<br>wants to feel comfort and from that feel<br>comfortable starts my comfort emotional<br>comfort I would say something like an<br>emotion I cannot say it's an emotion the<br>literature in emotions is quite chaotic<br>and I don't have the authority and<br>saying that and it would be getting into<br>trouble so it's a chess analogy I think<br>I propose that comfort can be treated as<br>an emotion and specifically I'm using<br>the model model of emotions this model<br>gathered ideas from two other models of<br>motion and says that emotions don't just<br>happen instantly they develop over time<br>in a cyclic sister so you start from a<br>situation that you need to pay attention<br>to from that you evaluate the situation<br>in what it's called and a price also<br>it's a cognitive process it's a fully<br>cognitive process is a state of the mind<br>and then it generates a response which<br>is the emotions of the response it's not<br>people's behavior is the emotion itself<br>in my case that response is going to be<br>a certain level of comfort which I need<br>to put names to everything here I'm<br>developing new language how does it look<br>in my case the situation it's includes<br>three elements so objective climatic<br>variables which is what we've been using<br>for years in building science of<br>temperature wind speed relative humidity<br>contrast slide illuminance and so on<br>environmental cues just everything else<br>everything we can to measure about the<br>physical world so smell maybe you can<br>measure that I don't know how it looks<br>is the view nice everything that people<br>can use for making inferences or ideas<br>and then there's people internal<br>elements and here's this is interesting<br>because a situation it's not a physical<br>situation it's<br>ecologically relevancy to it so your<br>expectations your lifestyle your<br>perceptions control your budget if you<br>want your household composition they are<br>all relevant in the way you perceive<br>different situations then you pay<br>attention to it and the appraisals are<br>adorned based on three concepts first is<br>perception which is again thermal<br>sensation clear and what we've been<br>building since we've been using for<br>years<br>then there's inferences so you want to<br>know how long is it gonna be warm the<br>house you don't want it to be in just a<br>moment everything you wanted to remain<br>warm forever hopefully and then there's<br>trade-offs so what did you sacrifice in<br>order to become warm to get comfortable<br>and that leads to comfort and comfort<br>may from from that level of comfort you<br>may behave and engage with the<br>environment so put a sweater turn the<br>heater on if you can and so on and so<br>forth something interesting about the<br>attention is that it rises a question is<br>every time you go and ask people about<br>the thermal sensation you are forcing<br>them to pay attention maybe they will<br>say they're uncomfortable or comfortable<br>even if they weren't thinking about it<br>so they weren't uncomfortable until you<br>asked them maybe that's one of the<br>questions that the this model would rise<br>now how does it work let me compact this<br>and try to explain it a little bit so<br>the first thing to say is that what we<br>understand of building is in building<br>science for comfort is contain these<br>models so objective climatic variables<br>lead to perceptions that are leading to<br>comfort<br>now since perceptions are the only thing<br>that leads to comfort it's only natural<br>to use it as a proxy and that's why<br>thermal sensation has been so often<br>assumed to be the main predictor for<br>comfort right a neutral thermal<br>sensation is calm now I'm arguing a<br>couple of things so the first thing is<br>that environmental cues are relevant<br>there are a lot of maybe not a lot but<br>there's there<br>the reserve it is showing that for<br>instance in 2007 rolls published this he<br>says that people in a fridge at 23<br>degrees felt colder that in a room at 23<br>degrees rolls it's a psychologist he<br>says that the reason for this is<br>intuition is that from past experience<br>since you know your brain knows your<br>subconscious brain knows that fridges<br>are cold you feel cold right some of my<br>data reveals that and I'm still<br>recording that but it says something<br>about so how space looks it's relevant<br>and people will change their answers to<br>thermal sensation votes based on how the<br>space looks or whether they know the<br>temperature rolls also made this<br>experiment of telling people<br>temperatures sometimes they were wrong<br>sometimes they were right on seeing how<br>the thermal sensation changed based on<br>knowing a temperature even if it's wrong<br>internal elements are relevant again in<br>in thermal comfort and even day lighting<br>as well and visual comfort we would say<br>everyone is different so some people<br>less tolerant more tolerant due to<br>physiological or anatomical reason suit<br>cold or to glare but my data shows that<br>it's not only that<br>so responding to in chile for instance<br>said that when you do not have children<br>cold does not matter I don't care about<br>children but cold if I'm not with the<br>kids right so the situation is<br>psychological this is not a thermal<br>sensation that he is feeling is his<br>extending she's concerned about comfort<br>perception I'm gonna skip it just<br>because it's what we already know<br>although my door is revealing that we<br>need to worry about more sensations that<br>we've been or perceptions that we've<br>been talking about for instance in<br>daylighting the people who mentioned<br>obviously glare and have been able to<br>read is one thing but there's also the<br>sense of connection with the exterior<br>you want to know how time is going you<br>want to know if it's day or night when<br>you wake up in the morning so those are<br>perceptions I would say<br>that we haven't cited at all that I am<br>aware in Francis referred to your sense<br>of stability so physiological neutrality<br>will not imply confidence you don't<br>think that's gonna last so one<br>respondent here Wellington said that she<br>wanted she liked to feel the rain as<br>long as she knew it was not going to<br>affect her so just getting the idea of<br>rain is gonna get in my house<br>it feels cold it it's it's a concern<br>related to work we may remember that I<br>asked her to describe our warm house and<br>she said she said she didn't like to<br>hear the rain or if she heard it she<br>wanted to hear it knowing that she was<br>not going to get into the house and<br>finally but I think this is pretty<br>important in my model is Trados so<br>physiological neutrality does not imply<br>comfort if sacrifices were made to<br>achieve for achieving such a state one<br>example and just one example is how many<br>layers of clothing do you use in a cold<br>which is awful right but there's also<br>money people don't just spend all the<br>money required to be comfortable they<br>struggle to decide how much money they<br>can spend there is also safety so not<br>all heaters are equally safe there's<br>privacy when daylighting you want more<br>windows but you don't want to to be<br>exposed and so on so if you ask me what<br>what is a comfortable house or<br>comfortable home well it's one that it<br>not only is warm and I'm gonna use warm<br>just to generalize that to other domains<br>not only it's warm which means it to<br>satisfy perception also looks warm which<br>satisfies the inferences or you feel<br>safe and it doesn't force people to<br>choose between warmth and other<br>nuisances and what<br>trying to build now and this is my final<br>slide is a model this is what I'm<br>calling the Atlas of comfort is not<br>finished but each concentric circle is<br>one element in this model so personal<br>internal elements environmental cues<br>objective climatic measurements<br>perception trade-offs and comfort and<br>the codes that are left in comfort are<br>about freedom and about well-being<br>people want to live their lives free<br>they don't want the house to tell them<br>what to do and they want the house to<br>feel like it's good for them so this is<br>for me comfort according to my data this<br>is a comfortable house is the goal that<br>Thank You Herman um if we could give him<br>a virtual clip if he can find the<br>virtual clip symbol that'd be great<br>thank you very much Cole so any<br>questions just again raise your virtual<br>hand or your actual hand if you've got<br>your do on um I can merely see you we<br>want any questions can I can I start off<br>like<br>one just before I can say now justjust<br>for that was in um just like what what<br>got you interested in this topic in the<br>fish like what why are you well I said<br>by so long it's a long story but I'm<br>gonna make it shirt so as an engineer I<br>wanted to sell comfortable houses<br>because that's I think the way that<br>houses will get better because<br>politicians are not improving building<br>codes so if we allow developers to make<br>money by selling comfort I think that<br>would help at least partly and what they<br>told me that people don't want comfort<br>they're not interested and I found that<br>really weird and I started researching<br>comfort and what people meant by comfort<br>and how can we offer comfort and I asked<br>the questions and I found these data and<br>I said well we don't know anything about<br>comfort with you that's what I'm doing<br>now right and Nigel you've got a<br>question it's mom I see you did your<br>study in New Zealand and in Chile<br>presumably to see if there were<br>differences between the two countries<br>yes I two parts the question number one<br>were the differences are number two are<br>the cultures in the two countries<br>there's always differences it depends on<br>the level of abstraction where you<br>analyze it I think so in the details of<br>course aware in Chile most people don't<br>like carpets so at that level of detail<br>they were but these blocks that I showed<br>you they were present both in Chile and<br>in New Zealand so this idea of<br>trade-offs they were mentioned every<br>time in Chile and in New Zealand the<br>idea of the role of perception there<br>they were similar so they were more<br>the cultures I think they're pretty<br>different<br>I would describe well I will describe<br>Chilean culture as of Western culture<br>although sometimes they classify us as<br>flats in which I don't know what that<br>means<br>but it's it's serious I mean it was<br>conquered by Spain so it's different in<br>that sense from to New Zealand right so<br>from from a very origin of the country<br>we have had different cultures and the<br>climate is different it's very different<br>so in Santiago and Wellington they have<br>Reaganite I feel like you should ask a<br>question because I'm just interested in<br>how comfortable your spaces cuz you're<br>doing ahead here you're here I am you<br>know probably the most unhappiest person<br>according to whom because togged up in<br>my little work from home the space but I<br>have a favorite saying which is<br>engineers have feelings which I often<br>have to repeat in the School of<br>Architecture there is an engineer we<br>care about other things than solely the<br>numbers but we should care and that's<br>why I think I congratulate you about on<br>choosing what will be a difficult<br>property study is no doubt about there<br>but the question I've got from my<br>freezing-cold is where I'm quite happy<br>and I'm very you know you know my<br>well-being is fine and what I'm<br>wondering about is are these spatial<br>things that are showing up in your<br>survey data that sort of kind of lead<br>towards this warmth for comfort for<br>instance materiality yeah we have this<br>assumption but there is a sense that and<br>would our warmer materials to deal with<br>them say steel in from the light<br>perspective is having say light on more<br>than one wall more comfortable and more<br>like do you actually feel better or more<br>comfortable in either one or you know<br>but the point I'm trying to make is are<br>these spatial issues or spatial things<br>that we can learn about as we move from<br>this rational design to a kind of<br>architectural designer gift to<br>understand what are the factors that<br>make the<br>comfortable mmm so I'm not well<br>war materials and war materials they<br>were mentioned right so and light colors<br>they were also mentioned in daylighting<br>but I'm not getting into the specific of<br>which materials exactly I think there's<br>two reasons to buy materials may be<br>important first because there's a<br>physical reason that some materials feel<br>warmer so the contact temperature is not<br>the same in timber as in concrete but<br>I'm not getting into the how many<br>windows you need I think that would be<br>ascetic on stage when we start doing<br>research on these perceptions that I'm<br>identifying right so I would like to<br>know how much direct light do you need<br>to actually feel that or to feel that<br>you're connected to the exterior and<br>knowing the weather okay yeah the<br>weather so yes or no I guess and I want<br>to mention something so someone spent is<br>saying here that you are they're asking<br>me whether you are uncomfortable because<br>you're wearing a jacket you said you<br>were cold<br>or you were in a cold place but just to<br>make some precision there is if you're<br>fine wearing a jacket then you're<br>comfortable but some people sometimes<br>feel they're forced to wear more layers<br>and they would like to because it's cold<br>so the question wouldn't be are you<br>uncomfortable though the question would<br>be would you like it to be warmer so you<br>could take off your hat and your jacket<br>that's the positive concept of comfort<br>that I'm trying to use you said somehow<br>kill the record and the reason I have<br>hidden in scarf on is because I can't<br>turn the heater on the same time it's a<br>fan heater so it makes a Helen Louise<br>that's a trade off it's a trainer yeah<br>was part of your definition wasn't it<br>the last part of any any final questions<br>I can't yeah lots of the<br>- hands clapping go my nickel well<br>obtain go go for it I'm just under<br>supervisor so I was going to say some<br>thanks at the end but question should I<br>I just wanted to say that I thought like<br>your introduction to the research<br>problem and working through the<br>literature was really clear there was<br>actually one of the better ones I've<br>seen in quite a while actually so thank<br>you for sharing that with looks like<br>quite a large community of other PhD<br>candidates so um thanks for preparing<br>that so clearly because I think people<br>often jump through what they know quite<br>quickly and so I thought you did that<br>thank you very much Mike Lee yeah well I<br>wanted to as one of the three<br>supervisors and the other two were here<br>Meroe<br>Michael Lee Johnstone from the Commerce<br>faculty and Casimir mcgregor from brands<br>have been I think hugely influential in<br>adding to my physicists background and<br>focus engineering well exactly and<br>focusing her man and my attention on to<br>a broader range the range that we wanted<br>to explore but bringing the expertise so<br>I just wanted to acknowledge those two<br>contributions as having helped immensely<br>in focusing this research congratulate<br>as tainted Herman on a very elegant and<br>erudite<br>presentation because I think it<br>influenced the the engagement that we<br>could all have with where you're<br>currently at in it's part way through<br>the thesis we know if to say what if<br>this model works let's apply it to<br>acoustics and air quality and see if it<br>still works<br>that's essentially what stage two of<br>this thesis is about but just wanted to<br>thank everyone for coming and encouraged<br>them if they don't want to ask a<br>Christian right now to email her man and<br>engage in a conversation because the<br>broader the conversation the better the<br>research will be and his so yeah we wish<br>you luck Darryl PhD and hopefully we'll<br>get to hear from you again towards the<br>Internet</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
