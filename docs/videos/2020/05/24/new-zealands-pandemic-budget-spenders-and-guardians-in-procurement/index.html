Barbara Allen Bob is an expert in<br>public procurement and performance she<br>is a senior lecturer in public policy<br>public management she also works<br>extensively in the fields of digital<br>governance particularly in the realm of<br>procurement and we're here today to talk<br>about some of the recent developments as<br>we move into the recovery from corvid 19<br>and particularly in response to last<br>week's budget so morning Bob morning<br>Michael nice to see you nice to see you<br>so if I if I could just bowed at the top<br>obviously we're all watching the<br>situation here in El Teatro very closely<br>and I just wondered if I could ask you<br>your thoughts generally about the<br>spending package that was announced last<br>week by the government in its budget<br>yeah thanks Michael really exciting<br>times isn't it from a public policy<br>perspective and what we've seen in the<br>last week is this 50 essentially 50<br>billion dollar kovat response and<br>recovery fund and we're looking at<br>spending that's across innumerable<br>sectors and sections of society and<br>business we've got an extended wage<br>subsidy package business support huge<br>infrastructure programs housing plans<br>train trades and training support jobs<br>around the environment money for the<br>health sector in terms of the district<br>health boards and PHARMAC and a reset<br>there early childhood education is<br>getting some money so it's a it's a<br>broad broad package that they've been<br>entitling the jobs budget so that's one<br>aspect to it for sure<br>but this is going to have a deep you<br>know repercussions across the economy<br>and across our health and well-being for<br>years and years to come so pretty big<br>big numbers there yeah there's no doubt<br>I think it's fair to say it probably in<br>the eyes of the world are currently<br>watching New Zealand not just because of<br>the remarkable response to Corbett but<br>the response movement in recovery with<br>this pretty landmark would you like you<br>say so specifically but if I could just<br>ask what do you think some of the kind<br>of the opportunities and challenges in<br>terms of the procurement space from the<br>government's point of view yeah well I<br>always sort of think back to some of<br>these frameworks that we've been taught<br>along the way so you'll you'll probably<br>be familiar or I'm sure you are with the<br>spenders and Guardians idea and Lebowski<br>talked about many many years ago but I<br>just saw something recently that savoie<br>Donald Savile wrote about spenders and<br>Guardians so it's by no means a sort of<br>a lost idea but this idea that you know<br>there's certain departments and agencies<br>that are spenders anxious to get<br>packages of money and want to hold on to<br>that money and understandably so and<br>then guardians who are looking after the<br>money and trying to monitor it control<br>it claw it back and that interplay<br>between the spenders and guardians so I<br>think Wow has there ever been you know a<br>bigger moment of spending than this and<br>how is that all going to play out now<br>that's understandable in a you know in<br>an emergency situation we have this<br>absolute need and I totally support this<br>package of spending but of course we go<br>to well what are the implications for<br>how that's going to be spent and how<br>we're going to procure the goods and<br>services that are going to be needed<br>along the way to do this so in an<br>emergency situation<br>naturally the government will relax some<br>of its procurement requirements and you<br>can obtain goods and services under<br>various you know guidelines that allow<br>you to do it quickly and around some of<br>the normal long processes which is<br>completely understandable<br>we have a centered lead procurement<br>agency here with and be the Ministry of<br>business innovation employment as Center<br>led as opposed to centralized which<br>means the departments and agencies hold<br>the responsibility for this their<br>spending decisions it's a<br>very flexible procurement framework<br>regime what what have you and there's a<br>set of government procurement rules that<br>have had various iterations the 2012 set<br>has been recently updated in 2019 to<br>allow for something called broader<br>outcomes which means organizations and<br>agencies are going to have to consider<br>wider wider elements of society and<br>well-being when they're procuring and<br>that was a much needed elaboration of<br>the rules so when we're thinking about<br>how we're going to be spending and just<br>quite quickly massive spending say in<br>infrastructure<br>how are the procurement rules going to<br>be applied and how are we going to guard<br>in fact against all those natural things<br>that go on when you want to procure you<br>want to go not in a you know people<br>aren't doing it because they want to be<br>corrupt they're just wanting to hurry up<br>and get the spending done support their<br>industries and get what needs get what<br>needs doing done so the frame there's a<br>very good framework in place that New<br>Zealand has built over over a long<br>period of time now you know in terms of<br>the the guardianship of the public purse<br>is something that I watch for and then<br>I'm really quite concerned about about<br>how that's going to be done going<br>forward as supportive as I am of the<br>need for jobs and doing all this quite<br>quickly there's still really important<br>role for watching the ways in which the<br>money is being spent and how actually<br>we're going to do all of that<br>sorry bit long-winded there but no not<br>at all and obviously as we both know my<br>research interested in on corruption and<br>fraud and that kind of thing and there's<br>a very strong correlation that massive<br>increase in public spending always<br>increases the opportunities and<br>fortunately for for things to go around<br>and so I'm particularly interested in<br>you're picking up on this notion of the<br>guardianship in the public purse rather<br>than just most people I think of<br>probably focus on the spending aspect<br>because he is such a such a generous<br>budget well picking up on this notion to<br>guardianship who do you think then Bob<br>are currently the guardians of the<br>public purse here in New Zealand and are<br>they're the best placed agencies to do<br>it what else would you like to see mmm<br>well very interesting because the<br>Ministry of business innovation<br>employment has had some reviews of of<br>its procurement frameworks and one of<br>the big guardians here is the Auditor<br>General the office of the Auditor<br>General plays a huge role and it's a<br>very interesting organisation in New<br>Zealand that's taken on a a role in<br>helping in fact the procurement function<br>to work better so three years ago<br>approximately they announced a<br>three-year review of the procurement<br>framework in New Zealand so that's a<br>number of different facets to that and<br>one of them has been looking at what's<br>called here the functional leadership so<br>MB plays the role of functional<br>leadership for procurement across the<br>New Zealand government so they are<br>essentially responsible for looking at<br>it in a holistic manner across all of<br>the organisations and that's looking for<br>economies efficiency it's interesting<br>the way that functional leadership<br>procurement is written up and so the OIG<br>has been looking at that it's been<br>looking at local government procurement<br>as one of its aspects and for example<br>recently with Co vyd it was asked to<br>look at the personal protective<br>equipment and the procurement of<br>personal protective equipment which of<br>course across the world you know you<br>don't have to look too far to see issues<br>that have been raised with that so<br>they're going to be reporting very very<br>soon on their their findings about what<br>has gone right and what has gone wrong<br>and that role that the OED plays is is<br>really really important because it's not<br>just saying you've done this wrong and<br>you've done that wrong well they're not<br>afraid to do that they're looking for<br>best practice<br>in terms of how organizations can do it<br>better really pushing the envelope and<br>saying hey in fact<br>with functional leadership it has said<br>to the state services commission hey you<br>need to figure out what this functional<br>leadership is and how it's going to work<br>and is it going to be a value and I've<br>noticed that some of the things that we<br>have access to have been taken down<br>recently because obviously everybody's<br>trying to reshape that and in this<br>current situation what's that role going<br>to be in terms of how we're going to<br>procure across government we have all<br>this spending about to be happening with<br>actually no national procurement<br>strategy for watching how that spending<br>is going to happen now I have no doubt<br>we have really good people in<br>procurement<br>we have excellent policy analysts and<br>people and there's been a lot of growth<br>and a lot of improvement in procurement<br>and spending and this kind of analysis<br>but there's still a lot of challenges<br>and a lot of weaknesses as well so<br>there's going to be a really important<br>role for the oag to continue in that<br>vein but they're only one organization<br>and who else is watching this well mb is<br>trying to put in place its own and again<br>that comes back to can we monitor<br>ourselves and are we able to get this<br>national procurement strategy in place<br>in time because I think we're really<br>lacking this overarching framework for<br>how we're going to do all this spending<br>the construction sector has come up with<br>this thing called a well in partnership<br>with government construction sector<br>accord which is a an excellent move<br>forward in terms of the sector working<br>with government to try to work it<br>improve some of the weaknesses in the<br>construction sector and anybody who's<br>followed New Zealand's construction<br>sector that's been a huge problem around<br>lack of cashflow workforce retention the<br>pipeline and there's there's a real need<br>to improve the the matching of that with<br>what the government's plans are so<br>there's there's that construction sector<br>Accord that's really involved in the<br>kovat response as well so that's really<br>good to see but I think there's<br>there's some there's some work to do<br>there as you know is being recognized<br>but some thinking for us to do as well<br>around well we have the spenders and who<br>are the guardians and what role are they<br>going to play in all of this and can we<br>with the speed at which this is going to<br>happen I think are we going to be able<br>to carefully look at that spending<br>thanks I've got one of the final<br>question we spent a lot of time this<br>morning talking about the government and<br>time what they're kind of the outside of<br>things but what about the supply side of<br>things what do you think that the<br>challenge is not maturity is in<br>procurement they're bearing in mind the<br>lips spending packages and everything<br>else mm-hmm yeah that's another video<br>isn't it the well the construction<br>center is part of that supply side which<br>is interesting and certainly some of the<br>big players have been able to get<br>involved in that and even be involved in<br>helping to develop a response to kovat<br>but there's certainly a lot of<br>challenges for SMEs the wage subsidies<br>have gone some way to help support them<br>there's government's given some relief<br>in terms of taxes and interest payments<br>and things like that but the SMEs that<br>supply a lot of you know government<br>goods and services are definitely in a<br>difficult position and we've got to pay<br>some attention to how they're going to<br>be supported over time and I know I know<br>there's work going on around that you<br>know there's opportunities in terms of<br>information technology and new zealand's<br>in a very good place to benefit from its<br>high-tech workforce from its really<br>innovative people and I think getting<br>the getting some of the weaknesses of<br>the supply chain management so I've<br>worked out which as we as innovative as<br>we are there are there are quite a lot<br>of sort of break points in supply chains<br>where they they actually don't have<br>enough technology to do things quickly<br>or to get seong into trading<br>relationships because we are a trading<br>nation to be able to scale up to say hey<br>you know we're really good at this and<br>we need to sell that to the world so<br>there's there's<br>some work to do there and some of the<br>small companies on the you know on the<br>infrastructure side there's different<br>associations like the employers and<br>manufacturers association today is<br>pushing really hard to get progress<br>going around for example upper north<br>island to get its projects off so we're<br>going to keep coming back to this<br>pressure on infrastructure projects and<br>big the big pipelines but we do need to<br>make sure we continue to focus on the<br>small organizations as well and not let<br>them fall by the wayside too much thank<br>you very much thank you for those<br>insights I just want to say general<br>thanks again to my colleague professor<br>Barbara Allen quite Michael a sorry not<br>to Vanara hopefully there Bob sorry dr.<br>Barbara Allen thanks again and if any<br>viewers would like to get in touch with<br>Bob she is available at the School of<br>Government Victoria University of<br>Wellington for all your procurement<br>questions and to share our insights with<br>you thanks again and hopefully we'll see<br>you next time thanks Michael it's been</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
