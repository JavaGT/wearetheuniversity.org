The Master of Drug Discovery and Development is a full year 180-point programme offered at Victoria University of Wellington in a collaboration with the Centre for Biodiscovery, the Ferrier Research Institute and the Schools of Biological Sciences and Chemical and Physical Sciences.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the Master of Drug Discovery and Development<br>is a one-year three semester intensive<br>taught program which has got equal parts<br>of taught coursework and also a<br>laboratory environment so the students<br>will get to see aspects of target<br>identification how natural products are<br>used in the manufacturing and drug<br>development world how we actually<br>physically manufacture these aspects<br>of toxicity and safety and the physical<br>nuts and bolts of getting a drug into a<br>manufacturing environment and out into<br>the clinic and as part of that too<br>they'll be exposed to research topics<br>about analytical chemistry and also<br>legal ramifications i.e. how do you protect<br>your intellectual property when you're<br>discovering and developing drugs with<br>the students working at the Ferrier<br>Research Institute we think we bring a<br>dedicated research environment because<br>all of my colleagues and peers are PhD<br>level research scientists with anywhere<br>between five and forty years experience<br>and that's a very very rare and special<br>environment for a new graduate student<br>to be involved in if they can't find the<br>answers in the literature or from their<br>supervisor they're just surrounded by<br>this artists collective of scientists<br>who have all this experience so it's a<br>bit more intensive than an Honours course<br>and it's but shorter the full Master's<br>degree course does require pretty good<br>grades to pursue it as well but those<br>who have bit more of an aggressive<br>attitude I think would really blossom in<br>the environment we're providing<br>so I was interested in this course because<br>I've been working in a pharmaceutical lab for the last five years<br>and looking at what was involved in this course it just seemed to be perfectly tailored to what I was<br>using and what i needed for the industry<br>I plan on using the information and knowledge I gain from this course to<br>further my career I'm going into drug<br>development network it's a relatively<br>new company here in New Zealand and in<br>they're wanting to get into development<br>I was interested in the Master's of drug<br>discovery and development because it's a<br>one-year master's it's great being<br>surrounded by professionals who can<br>always help that's a great community<br>sense and great resources available so<br>after the Master's of drug discovery and development I plan to<br>do my PhD I want to carry on doing further study<br>and I think this is been a great way of stepping up to do that.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
