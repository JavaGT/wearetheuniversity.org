today with Spencer<br>Lowe a recent graduate of the University<br>and he's here to share a little bit of a<br>story that has experience with work<br>integrated learning so Spencer before we<br>get started with my questions you want<br>to tell us a little bit about yourself<br>and what you do yeah absolutely so my<br>edge you know my name's Spencer I'm<br>originally from the Manawatu<br>and start of 2017 I made the trip up to<br>Waikato to begin my bachelor's degree<br>Bachelor of Communication Studies<br>majoring in marketing public relations<br>so yeah I've been up here for three<br>years now I'm loving the city it grows<br>on me more and more every day<br>believe it or not and ya know I've<br>thoroughly enjoyed my time up here so<br>far I've gotten involved in a lot of<br>different kind of groups and clubs and<br>and met some really neat people of<br>medicine medical stuff along the way<br>awesome and you've had a bit of a cool<br>experience with work integrated learning<br>so I really want to hear about that tell<br>us about the experience and kind of what<br>went through yeah sure so I was actually<br>a friend who sent me the the the link<br>for the job application or the<br>internship application originally so I<br>applied for an internship with a company<br>called chefs 72 and what they do is<br>since you make software for video<br>on-demand platforms primarily so I went<br>in and had a chat with them and even in<br>the interview it was really great they<br>kind of asked what I want out of this<br>this internship you know and I pretty<br>much said that for me the best thing is<br>to be able to learn as much from as many<br>different aspects of the organization as<br>possible from a marketing perspective a<br>sales perspective NPO as well and they<br>did exactly that they they throw me in<br>the deep end with a lot of different<br>stuff which is what I wanted and it's<br>helped me kind of really steer my<br>passion in my career kind of focus onto<br>a nice path where I can lay out my<br>future quite well so yeah it's very<br>great I've worked alongside some really<br>cool people and some some neat stuff<br>from from working with them there I<br>don't think I would have necessarily got<br>from study so that it's kind of tired<br>and really well<br>to kind of prepare me as best as<br>possible kind of leaving University in<br>getting into the working world come in<br>talking of the working world your now<br>what's the company Agnew yes yes so over<br>the break actually I was working packing<br>packing you know online orders for know<br>lemmings and I get a message from the<br>CEO asking if I'd be interested in<br>jumping into their team and they're kind<br>of and the sales aspect of it which is<br>definitely that the the kind of part<br>that was the most interesting to me<br>through my time as an intern and because<br>right now obviously video on-demand<br>platforms and all they're kind of<br>shifting a lot of that physical stuff<br>into an online presence it's very bad<br>given the current kind of state of<br>things so obviously for being one of the<br>lucky companies to come out of us let's<br>sit up okay<br>so ya know it's really really cool have<br>you had any challenges like have you<br>faced anything in your current role or<br>during an internship that you've found a<br>little bit difficult and how did you<br>overcome lows yeah so there is there is<br>an element of difficulty I think and<br>translating what you've learnt at<br>University into a proper applied City so<br>and especially right now given how busy<br>things are for us it's really it hasn't<br>been a gradual transition into the role<br>as much as would have been nice but at<br>the same time I felt like I've learned<br>more this way and I've been able to<br>prepare myself better because I've been<br>you know it's all been on the fly and<br>I've just been picking up stuff as as I<br>go and I guess that's kind of work for<br>me so that would probably be it because<br>at the same time I've had an amazing<br>mentor and nephews over it was actually<br>a recent graduate of the University of<br>Waikato as well so we've been working<br>together on a lot of projects and he's<br>been nothing but outstanding at helping<br>me kind of pick things up and get moving<br>that's really awesome<br>you must be so stressful starting a job<br>during the pandemic yes it's interesting<br>a because move it you know with a lot of<br>people with the<br>talking about redundancy and jobs going<br>under and things like that to get a I<br>missed it from the CIO asking me for you<br>know to join their team this was such an<br>awesome experience and and you know I'm<br>very proud of yeah that's really cool I<br>love the fact that you've been able to<br>find work and this time to show that<br>there are jobs available out there it's<br>just fine yeah absolutely<br>um have you been any particular skills<br>that you've actually had to adapt<br>through the pandemic am i working from<br>home<br>definitely upping my motivation or do I<br>should I say it's I'm easily distracted<br>I guess you could say so working from<br>home of head to almost barricade my my<br>door shut to the store you know built up<br>office that I've made over the last<br>couple of days so just being able to<br>keep focused throughout the day because<br>we're still working you know 8 to 5<br>Monday to Friday so you know and just<br>making sure that I'm always on task in<br>keeping keeping focuses it's been<br>difficult but good have you played any<br>systems in place to make sure you don't<br>feel isolated or like anything to help<br>with that motivation because you are<br>alone I think as a lot of people who<br>know me would what appreciate is I'm a<br>very social person so for me it's just<br>making sure that I'm keeping in regular<br>contact with my lovely fiancee obviously<br>but also my friends so just just kind of<br>regular chatting with them outside of<br>work hours obviously has been the most<br>important but we've also gotten some new<br>flatmates in as well so that's kind of<br>helped keep me you know keep me<br>socializing and and<br>allowing me to kind of have there that<br>divide from work time to social and<br>relaxing time oh it sounds like you're<br>dealing with it really well I'm trying<br>to yeah yeah I'm from your time at the<br>University have they made any<br>significant learning say you've taken<br>into your career and kind of have helped<br>you yes that's that's a really good<br>question and it's probably something<br>that I'd like to talk to quite a lot<br>life from<br>from the time that I've spent at<br>university I think the thing that I've<br>learnt the most moving forward into my<br>career has have been official nitwit sir<br>being able to build strong networks<br>early and through the University of<br>Waikato that was one of the easiest<br>things to do with the amount that's on<br>offer be there clubs and societies and<br>just spending time on degree and things<br>like there have helped me develop helped<br>me to develop very strong relationships<br>and strong networks and connections with<br>people that have really kind of helped<br>me get to where I am today so that would<br>be a recommendation for anyone else out<br>there would be to would be to get<br>involved wherever possible awesome so<br>that your key piece of advice for<br>students yeah yeah essentially it would<br>be just just get involved it's not<br>actually you know people people quite<br>often say to me that it's quite<br>difficult kind of transitioning into a<br>job that pertains to your degree I think<br>and without sounding without sky ting I<br>would almost say that that's not the<br>case if you put in the work I think by<br>having a strong Network getting involved<br>wherever possible it makes that the<br>opportunities just present themselves<br>and the University of Waikato is such a<br>great platform to do so come that's<br>awesome and eating advice for students<br>post pandemic is there anything you<br>would say to them to help them stand up<br>from a crowd<br>I guess much the same you know just keep<br>those keep those networks open I keep<br>those communication channels open get<br>involved in and you know as much as it<br>might seem like a bit of a drag take on<br>an unpaid internship or even offered it<br>to fill in a company and do some unpaid<br>labor like through the break I even got<br>in contact with I can't remember the<br>name just asked me hey can I help with<br>any marketing I'm just at home I'm doing<br>nothing you know this is time where I<br>could spend you know sitting on on my<br>playstation or I could actually be out<br>helping people and obviously through<br>that you're making new teachers every<br>day so yeah just keep those<br>communication channels open and<br>and hit the ground running as soon as<br>those things back to normal awesome<br>thanks so much for that Spencer it<br>sounds like you've had a great time<br>transitioning from university life they<br>kind of where your career goes from here<br>yeah thank you so much for your time<br>today not a problem at all you have a<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
