Government at Victoria University<br>of Wellington and I’m speaking today with<br>my colleague, Professor Michael Macaulay and<br>we’re interested in bring to you some information,<br>some thought about some of our research interests<br>and Michael is going to talk to us about his<br>particular areas which I’ll let him expand<br>but are primarily around, trust, integrity,<br>and anti-corruption.<br>Michael did you want to say any opening words<br>before I ask you our tough questions?<br>Thanks, Barb.<br>No, I’m just happy to be talking to you<br>this morning.<br>I’m very happy to be talking about not just<br>my work, I’m not going to talk about that.<br>But what I’m interested in is the impact<br>of COVID-19 and the New Zealand response on<br>some of the areas that I’ve been researching,<br>particularly trust and integrity.<br>Fantastic.<br>Okay, let’s get right into it.<br>So, would you say that New Zealand is generally<br>a trusting nation or maybe a more trusting<br>nation than any of the others and how that<br>maybe has emerged through this last period?<br>Well, there’s no doubt that public trust<br>in the government and the government response<br>is very high, extremely high at the minute,<br>and you can see just by how well people have<br>accepted the lockdown and kept within the<br>boundaries and rules of the lockdown that<br>people don’t just say that they have a good<br>trust, but they have demonstrated that trust<br>through their own actions.<br>And the short answer is that New Zealand generally<br>is a more trusting nation certainly than most<br>OECD countries the latest figures from the<br>OECD show, for example, in terms of satisfaction<br>and confidence, which is about as good a proxy<br>as we can get for trust, that 64% of New Zealanders<br>have trust in their government and satisfaction<br>and confidence across the public service and<br>that’s with an average of 45% across the<br>OECD countries.<br>It’s not just the OECD though, within New<br>Zealand there are a number of different surveys,<br>a number of different pieces of work.<br>There’s the Institute for Governance and<br>Policy Studies that has a survey that they’ve<br>been running since 2016 which has shown that<br>there has always been a high level of trust<br>in the government and that has increased under<br>the Ardern government’s reign.<br>There are also very specific pieces of work<br>and studies on specific areas of the public<br>service.<br>So there are numerous different surveys of<br>New Zealand Police, again that shows a higher<br>proportion of trust in the Police, disproportionally<br>high when you compare it with other jurisdictions<br>across the world.<br>The Police’s own statistics I think show<br>about 75-78% trust in the Police at the minute.<br>Other surveys, outside of the Police, actually<br>have that higher.<br>And we have things like the Kiwis Count survey<br>which looks at trust in the public service<br>more generally and again you can see that<br>public trust in the public service is very<br>high – it’s up to about the high 70s early<br>80s I think.<br>That’s trust from have experience and work<br>within the public sector, so are customers<br>of the public service, not actual public servants.<br>So it is very high – that’s the short<br>answer.<br>There is a longer answer.<br>Let me just prompt the other part of the answer<br>I suppose then in the sense of the government<br>has clearly benefited from that in terms of<br>getting people to agree to do a very restrictive<br>lockdown.<br>Without a doubt – so we’re starting from<br>a high trust base but I don’t think we should<br>overlook some of the leadership behaviours<br>that have come from the government, particularly<br>from the Prime Minister.<br>Which I do think really show a high level<br>of trustworthiness.<br>So we’re building from a relatively high<br>base compared to other countries, but lets<br>not underestimate just how much trust this<br>particular government has generated and what<br>our political leaders have generated in this<br>moment because I think they have exponentially<br>taken that higher.<br>So does Jacinda Ardern deserve her international<br>reputation for leadership do you think?<br>Yes, I do think she does.<br>I think she shows trustworthiness across the<br>basic building blocks, the psychological building<br>blocks of trust.<br>So anyone will be able to tell you this, any<br>psychologist will be able to tell you this,<br>they might not use these exact terms or these<br>exact words, but the main building blocks<br>of building a trust relationship are to demonstrate<br>credibility, to demonstrate reliability, and<br>to demonstrate knowability and I think Jacinda<br>Ardern demonstrates all those three things<br>in spades.<br>The knowability part of it…<br>Well, knowability is about empathy.<br>Ok.<br>And obviously she comes across as a very empathetic<br>person but its also in communication style.<br>So one of the things that went around the<br>world, but I think it does show a great aspect<br>of Jacinda Ardern’s leadership, was the<br>public announcement about the Easter Bunny<br>for example.<br>That kind of demonstrates a humanity, and<br>it demonstrates a friendly face on top of<br>the very serious nature of the message that<br>just gives that added empathy, and like I<br>say, that added knowability.<br>I think there’s a strong sense in New Zealand<br>that we feel we really know our Prime Minister<br>in a way that some jurisdictions don’t.<br>Although that’s obviously a little bit speculative.<br>Do you think there’s any chinks in that?<br>Obviously every leader takes criticism and<br>it appears the opposition there’s some struggles<br>to even, sort of, criticise effectively.<br>So what’s that about do you think?<br>I do think there are chinks.<br>Within New Zealand, the big chink is while<br>the vast majority of people really do have<br>a huge amount of affection and respect for<br>the Prime Minister, it doesn’t mean they<br>support the Labour Party.<br>And of course the way the last election went<br>– the Labour Party was quite handily defeated<br>and so there’s no guarantee people will<br>translate their respect for Jacinda Ardern<br>in any upcoming vote.<br>I suspect they probably will to be honest,<br>but there’s no guarantee of that.<br>And so you’ve got to balance the personalisation<br>of politics in New Zealand with the reverence<br>we have for Jacinda Ardern with the more day-to-day<br>understanding of belief and party support<br>that exists within the country.<br>So that’s very much a chink in the armour.<br>All the great things she does might not have<br>quite the impact that you’d expect them<br>to have due to the way people vote.<br>And because of the way we have for our electoral<br>system.<br>The other thing of course is that Jacinda<br>Ardern is brilliant in a crisis.<br>When we talk about credibility, reliability,<br>and knowability.<br>In terms of reliability she has shown time<br>and again that she is brilliant in a crisis.<br>She showed it at the Christchurch tragedy<br>last year.<br>She’s fantastic at being able to generate<br>public sympathy, generate public empathy,<br>and really generate a sense of togetherness<br>and community feeling which is a genuine,<br>genuine gift and a skill so she’s brilliant<br>in a crisis.<br>One thing I should mention though is that<br>New Zealand is not always going to be in a<br>crisis.<br>Right<br>And a lot of the criticism that has been connected<br>to Jacinda Ardern has been the non-crisis<br>elements of it.<br>I don’t think anyone would argue that she<br>isn’t brilliant in this situation but obviously<br>she does have her critics in the day-to-day<br>policy making and the day to day policy decisions<br>that her government have made.<br>Absolutely, so all of that leads into our<br>next question pretty nicely in terms of future<br>challenges to this notion of public trust<br>as we move through our lockdown levels.<br>Even into some different and new phases of<br>this worldwide pandemic and what do you think<br>those are going to be?<br>Well I do think there is a potential for trust<br>to ebb and flow particularly during the rebuild<br>phase.<br>And that’s quite natural and that’s quite<br>common.<br>In the middle of a crisis there does tend<br>to be more of a sense of togetherness.<br>And you see this on a personal level let alone<br>a kind of public/political level.<br>When a family member dies they all pay their<br>respects and put their differences aside.<br>Once the will starts to get read and things<br>like that begin to happen and people try to<br>move on with their lives frictions and factions<br>occur again.<br>I suspect that could be the case here.<br>So even in the media we’ve already had a<br>number of medical experts attacking the credibility<br>of the government’s data on community outbreaks<br>and community transmission and suggesting<br>that they’re only reporting on 4% of community<br>transmission cases when you reread the data<br>in another way it could be up to 28% of community<br>transmission cases and things like that.<br>So already the credibility of the data may<br>already be under some scrutiny, I wouldn’t<br>quite go attack just yet.<br>But as we rebuild it will be the phase of<br>who’s going to get what, who’s going to<br>do what, where are resources going to de deployed,<br>how can we say they are going to be deployed<br>to the correct people or the most appropriate<br>groups or the most needed situation and so<br>on and so forth.<br>Trust can go again, and it really can.<br>Yeah absolutely.<br>Well I think our School of Government has<br>a lot to offer in terms of expertise like<br>your own and others that we’ll be talking<br>to.<br>Is there any other messages or ideas or questions<br>that you want to raise that people could think<br>about or ask us about as time goes on?<br>The only other thing I guess I’d like to<br>mention is how unhelpful it can be sometime<br>to have cross-jurisdictional comparisons.<br>It is true that New Zealand is doing incredibly<br>well, there’s no doubt about that and it<br>should be praised and I firmly believe that<br>the government should be praised for their<br>reaction to this crisis.<br>That doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re<br>transferable or even comparable to other nations.<br>We obviously had a little bit of fortune in<br>that we had a relatively long lead in time<br>and the physical location of New Zealand gives<br>a number of advantages.<br>The ability to control borders and so on and<br>so forth which definitely helped.<br>Now that’s not to minimise the leadership<br>response which obviously took advantage of<br>those but I do see the international press<br>and see New Zealand as being hailed as almost<br>like a saviour which I think is a little bit<br>worrying when I’m not sure that other countries<br>could respond like New Zealand did just because<br>of the contextual differences but I wish that<br>more of them did respond with the same level<br>of decisiveness that our government has shown.<br>Great points I think that there’s so much<br>for us to study and learn and reflect on going<br>forward I think that it is really important<br>we learn from our country examples, not just<br>from New Zealand but around the world, but<br>also that we really weary of this comparison,<br>as we are in Public Policy and Public Management,<br>that we’re always really careful of that<br>and we should be.<br>So that’s absolutely fantastic Michael.<br>I really appreciate you contributing today<br>and we will probably come back to this in<br>many forms in the future so thank you very<br>much.<br>Thanks Barb.<br>Kia ora.</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
