Wellington School of Business and Government hosted a fascinating discussion with Professor James Higham from Otago Business School, Professor James Renwick from Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington, and Professor Susanne Becken from Griffith University where they discussed what a sustainable future for New Zealand tourism might look like post COVID-19.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

to<br>katoa<br>so I'm welcoming you as the chair for<br>this webinar I'm Christian shot I'm from<br>the tourism group at Victoria University<br>I am currently living in my tea tablet<br>area on the south coast of Myton and<br>it's a real pleasure to to host this<br>webinar because I think it definitely<br>resonates with people we we are looking<br>at a situation which is unprecedented we<br>have never been in this situation for<br>and hopefully we'll never be in this<br>situation again but it is a situation<br>which is on the one hand very<br>challenging and as tragic as it wipes<br>through the website people across the<br>world but it is also an opportunity<br>where we can think that as we need to<br>stop and re-envision and reimagine what<br>we want the tourism industry museum to<br>look like this is really the opportunity<br>because everything had to be paused and<br>in this context of really thinking about<br>what we can do with the tourism industry<br>in New Zealand the contextualization<br>sits around the report by the<br>parliamentary Commissioner for the<br>environment about tourism being pristine<br>popular and imperiled so very strong<br>wording and it was very timely when it<br>came out in December 2019 and this is<br>giving us the the context for this talk<br>so how can we reimagine tourism in New<br>Zealand ideally sustainable tourism and<br>it's my pleasure to introduce the three<br>speakers we have professor James Renwick<br>and James has 40 years experience in<br>weather and climate research his main<br>field is large-scale climate variability<br>over the southern hemisphere and the<br>impacts of climate variability and<br>change on the Pacific Museum<br>the Arctic James has been a lead author<br>for the International Intergovernmental<br>Panel on Climate Change for many years<br>including the sixth assessment reports<br>to be published in 2021 he was awarded<br>the Prime Minister's 2018 Prize for<br>science communication and has recently<br>been appointed to the New Zealand<br>climate change commission and James is<br>based<br>so James Renwick is based at Victoria<br>University and he is talking about<br>climate change and the future of tourism<br>second in our lineup will be Professor<br>Susannah bacon from Griffith University<br>and Susannah bacon is a professor of<br>sustainable tourism at Griffith<br>University and the principal science<br>investment adviser in the visitor area<br>and the Department of Conservation she<br>is also a Vice Chancellors research<br>fellow at the University of Surrey in<br>the UK Susanna's mission is to undertake<br>robust research on some of the pressing<br>problems facing the tourism sector and<br>working with key stakeholders towards<br>developing positive solutions and she<br>will talk about sustainable tourism in<br>covert 19 and the question back to<br>basics and we have from the deep south<br>professor james heim who's a professor<br>in the OU Targus Business School at the<br>University of Otago his research<br>interests address tourism and global<br>environmental change at the global<br>national and local scales of analysis<br>and in pragmatic terms his working<br>hypothesis is that the covert 19<br>recovery pathway must lead towards the<br>climate safe and resilient tourism<br>system that we need and want and he will<br>be talking about a global prototype<br>building a 21st century post culvert<br>tourism system so I think you will all<br>agree that these three people are truly<br>experts in their field and they bring<br>very nice and enriching and diverse<br>perspectives and before we ask James<br>Renwick to kick us off I would just like<br>to<br>remind people that there is no<br>opportunity to throw questions into the<br>the panelists talks but instead to<br>please use the Q&amp;A function where you<br>can post your questions and they can<br>also be uploaded and at the end of the<br>three presentations we will take the<br>opportunity to go through a Q&amp;A where we<br>will target the questions at the<br>appropriate speaker I'll put it out for<br>everyone okay so thank you very much for<br>giving your opportunity to introduce<br>everyone and I hand over to James<br>Renwick with climate change in the<br>thank you very much Cristian I'm Jorah<br>koto<br>thanks to Victoria University Wellington<br>business for hosting this event today I<br>think it's really great so I am I guess<br>you might say I'm the bad cop I'm giving<br>some of the bad news in a way upfront so<br>as you can see my totally a climate<br>change in the future of tourism and my<br>goal here is just to to put a few things<br>on the table about where we're at with<br>climate change what the future may hold<br>and what are some of the implications<br>not just for tourism but really for<br>global society domestic society and how<br>we live our lives in future so if we<br>could have the next slide please<br>so one of my favourite pictures here<br>this this is a graph of carbon dioxide<br>concentration in the atmosphere over the<br>last thirteen thousand years the reason<br>I show this graph that mostly comes from<br>ice cores and Antarctica because we only<br>have a record from the atmosphere of the<br>last 60 years or so but the climate<br>system in the carbon cycle on earth<br>operates on this kind of times go ten<br>thousand years it's quite fast for a<br>rise in carbon dioxide like we've seen<br>in the last couple of hundred years of<br>nearly a 50% increase on the<br>pre-industrial level and the stuff warms<br>the atmosphere you put more carbon<br>dioxide in the air and the surface of<br>the earth gets warmer that's a bit of<br>basic physics so if we've pumped all us<br>carbon dioxide into the air and unless<br>we find ways to remove it through some<br>new technology that will be there for<br>thousands of years so we have already<br>changed the climate significantly and if<br>we don't stop adding to the problem like<br>this we are going to see significantly<br>more climate change and the feeling near<br>future so I just put please so we've had<br>this rise and carbon dioxide since the<br>start of Industrial Revolution<br>nearly three hundred years ago the first<br>half of that rise took about two hundred<br>and thirty years and the second half of<br>the rise<br>click again has taken only 30 years so<br>in the time that the intergovernmental<br>panel on climate change has been doing<br>its work we've actually doubled the size<br>of the problem so while it's been a lot<br>of talk about action there hasn't<br>actually been any action yet and we're<br>now at a point where there's more carbon<br>dioxide in the air that has been for<br>several million years so this is a<br>pretty again another unprecedented<br>situation for Humanity and if we keep<br>going the way we are now at the amount<br>we put into the atmosphere and you click<br>will find that in 10 years we will have<br>lot done one and a half degrees of<br>warming which was the threshold of the<br>zero carbon actors as the the limit<br>we're not supposed to go beyond or the<br>Paris agreement really talks about two<br>degrees of warming somewhere between 1.5<br>and two and if we click again that that<br>two degrees of warming at the present<br>rates will be there will be very close<br>to it within 20 years and final click on<br>the slide and 40 years we'll be at 3<br>degrees of warming and those sorts of<br>levels of warming we're talking about<br>seriously dangerous changes to the<br>climate in terms of how humanity<br>operates so we just go to the next slide<br>so these are the kind of things we're<br>talking about with climate change so<br>high temperature extremes heat waves<br>droughts big risks around food security<br>so crop failure and also water<br>availability issues as the sea levels<br>rise because the waters warmer partly we<br>get more and more coastal erosion and<br>damage to coastal infrastructure warmer<br>temperatures and drier soils lead to<br>greater increase and the risk of fires<br>the photograph there is actually from<br>the port hills in Christchurch a few<br>years ago and at the worst end of the<br>scale and I'm not saying this is going<br>to happen and now neighborhood<br>necessarily but that picture of the<br>burning tank down bottom right there<br>that's from has taken in Syria a while<br>ago and the Syrian civil war was partly<br>triggered by a very severe drought that<br>in that part of the Middle East over a<br>number of years and it's well known that<br>that the severity of that drought was<br>enhanced increased by the climate change<br>that we've already seen so the more<br>warming we get the more of these kinds<br>of things are likely to happen and when<br>you have problems with food security and<br>resource availability for large<br>populations and places like Asia let's<br>say you know this can lead to major<br>issues for human populations<br>displacement because of sea level rise<br>or an ability for populations to feed<br>themselves are going to be potentially<br>at least really damaging to society and<br>really damaging to the global economy so<br>if we go to the next slide the World<br>Economic Forum thinks about all the<br>stuff on a regular basis they put out a<br>Global Risk report every year you can<br>look it up online and one of the<br>graphics they have is this this one I<br>show here they have a a two-dimensional<br>plot of the likelihood of different<br>risks this is risks to the global<br>economy and then the impact that's the<br>vertical scale and you can see from this<br>year's report on the top right corner<br>these are the things that are most<br>likely and most dangerous the very top<br>one is failure to act on climate change<br>plus extreme weather and biodiversity<br>loss all three of these are tied<br>together and according to the World<br>Economic Forum which was a bunch of<br>central bankers from around the world<br>mostly they are saying that these are<br>the biggest risks to the global economy<br>our water crises are in there too and<br>over towards the left-hand side we've<br>got infectious diseases so that the<br>pandemic we're experiencing right now<br>certainly is up there in terms of impact<br>on the global economy but in terms of<br>you know looking to the future we may<br>well see another outbreak down the track<br>but climate change is happening right<br>now and it's ongoing so it's considered<br>to be far more likely to affect the<br>global economy then then another<br>pandemic<br>or and further over on the Left we've<br>got nuclear Wars which of course are<br>extremely damaging if they happen but<br>relatively unlikely so no it's hard to<br>overstate the risks for the future in<br>terms of climate change and that's<br>really the message I want to give not so<br>much about tourism but we really have to<br>think about what society will be like<br>and future if action on climate change<br>does not pick up a lot of speed and the<br>next well next year or two actually then<br>it's very hard to say what the global<br>economy and walk travel and tourist<br>activities what what are they going to<br>look like so just to run through a few<br>ideas for a wrap-up if we go to the next<br>slide and click again so obviously<br>tourism was a significant sector of the<br>global economy but it does depend on<br>affordable and reliable international<br>travel something that's come along I'd<br>say just in the last thirty years or so<br>but growth and the middle classes and<br>some what we're at least developing<br>countries such as in China and it's well<br>known that air travel is a big emitter<br>of carbon dioxide that the best way to<br>improve you or increase your own carbon<br>footprint is to fly more so as a part of<br>the global total we're only really<br>talking on the order of five percent<br>right now but as other sectors<br>decarbonize emissions from from flying<br>from travel from tourism are going to<br>become more and more important and<br>there's going to be more pressure put on<br>reducing those and unless we can develop<br>let's say electrically powered long-haul<br>aircraft it's it's going to be a major<br>issue for the sector I think click Next<br>so it really to meet this one point five<br>degree threshold or to stop at that<br>threshold emissions globally really have<br>to start reducing no later than this<br>year and they are reducing because of<br>the pandemic because of all the<br>lockdowns but that is just not a<br>sustainable way to go and we have to<br>find ways to capitalize on the<br>reductions we're seeing this year and<br>move rapidly towards renewable energy<br>production and so on so all of these<br>really projects people talk about we<br>have to make sure we choose ones that<br>move us in the right direction in terms<br>of energy energy use so you know the<br>risks to the global economy if we don't<br>achieve reductions and really get on top<br>of the problem I mean I think the best<br>way to express it as you know code<br>nineteen on steroids it could be a lot<br>worse than it has been this year if we<br>don't watch out so final slide I just<br>clicked through I think so international<br>tourism I think could come back as it<br>used to be it's possible if several<br>things happen if the airlines were just<br>resuscitate if travel remains affordable<br>and if there aren't other you know major<br>hurdles down the track with the global<br>economy but I think tourism is likely to<br>become more local more domestic you know<br>I think the global economy might might<br>permanently shrink a bit and there'll be<br>more emphasis on sort of the detail the<br>authentic experience closer to home than<br>zipping off to Paris to see the Eiffel<br>Tower for instance and in New Zealand<br>itself you know coastlines are eroding<br>glaciers are melting etc it really is<br>going to change what New Zealand is and<br>what it means to us and what it means to<br>possible visitors from overseas so you<br>know I'd like to pose the question<br>there's tourism a sustainable or<br>reliable part of the economy at all and<br>wonderful thank you James and that's a<br>nice noir to finish on and I'm sure that<br>we'll get the discussion going and<br>hopefully the the transition has worked<br>well and everybody has been able to hear<br>well and seen the slides clearly I would<br>now like to shift over to another person<br>who was an expert in climate change more<br>on the tourism context but has also done<br>a lot more work more broadly into<br>sustainability so professor zona beckon<br>from Griffith and doc and the University<br>of Surrey on the sustainable future for<br>in new zealand's Thank You Christian Qi<br>everyone and James we couldn't have<br>planned it better with your segue to my<br>talk because I think the short answer of<br>course is that I think chosen will play<br>an important role in New Zealand for the<br>economy and society the question is how<br>big and what type of person bats are I<br>will I will give you some of my thoughts<br>and and also been looking forward to<br>where James<br>I am take so then where the questions<br>come and I invite everyone in might be<br>first slide question I invite everyone<br>to go back to the basic specter of<br>history and you can see a collection of<br>out tours and effort items but what I<br>wonder if everyone can try and remember<br>the first time they actually and went on<br>an aeroplane because my my hypothesis is<br>that it is has been such a significant<br>event such a meaningful experience that<br>people probably can remember their first<br>flight who they went with where they<br>were and how they felt it cetera and and<br>then maybe think about how many flights<br>you've taken since then and it all<br>becomes a bit of a blur and I can hear<br>some people probably talk about my<br>carbon footprint which obviously this<br>current crisis gives us an opportunity<br>to rethink some of it so some back to<br>basics in terms of why do we actually<br>travel what does it mean and in where<br>has this how machine North rose and I<br>might call it that's why we talk about<br>an industry not so much a social<br>activity and in Watson industry we have<br>taken us and next slide and I'm a little<br>bit cheeky by putting up stereotypes of<br>images here so I know that and cheap<br>low-cost airlines freedom canvas coaster<br>up so I thought I'd just sort of trigger<br>a little bit of a rain break here but of<br>course people say we have democratized<br>travel and that's fantastic and the<br>missus can can go everywhere but there's<br>obviously and I think before the carpet<br>crisis it became very clear and in many<br>parts of the world and in New Zealand<br>and then it was a bit too much of a good<br>thing it has become quite commercial<br>it's become faster and faster<br>a lot of external influence outside from<br>the communities and it really market<br>driven often by garbage companies and in<br>public sectors have often step back so<br>my question is what can we learn from<br>that where to be not going to go back<br>and we can we maybe have that the good<br>things that tourism offer and on the<br>next slide and and sort of linking a<br>little bit to what James said and you<br>can find on the internet a lot of<br>discussion on how is Carwood competing<br>with climate change and desert crowd or<br>climate change with the opposite etc um<br>I try to take a positive spin here to<br>say okay it's it's a huge opportunity I<br>in some ways I would actually say it's a<br>rehearsal because if you looked at<br>James's lights the climate crisis is<br>potentially but in fact it is much<br>bigger because it will literally affect<br>everything and everyone and not just<br>particular groups and industries but it<br>will change the how thin is how it is it<br>is bigger and we need to make sure we<br>learn from this the good thing I think<br>it shows people understand that<br>everything is connected and also<br>everyone's every everyone's washing<br>hands has an impact so don't say in the<br>future when you jump in the car<br>oh it doesn't make a difference<br>everything else and the chart on the<br>right hand side is really interesting<br>and because it shows the forecast of<br>where the co2 emissions for this year<br>for me four to seven percent flower and<br>there's the kind of in your reductions<br>we would need to see year-on-year and<br>and you can just now think about oh my<br>god how hard was that and hopefully it<br>will have minimal plant life but they<br>will obviously be significant change I<br>just put a few points down there from<br>the recent budget in New Zealand and<br>they've got a little bit in that<br>direction to make sure recovery is green<br>but they could probably be a bit more on<br>the climate fund but there's there's<br>money left so here's my hub<br>next slide I thought before we talk<br>about the future let's have a quick look<br>at where tourism in New Zealand was at<br>saw some diagnostics and while we're<br>definitely not Bali or the Costa Brava<br>and I think New Zealand has seen the<br>start of mistress and where in some ways<br>there's been diminishing returns on more<br>and more volume so it has<br>volume written and you can see the<br>arrivals here and then next you can see<br>the spending which even though we try to<br>get high spending visits in here's<br>actually stagnate and if you think again<br>you see the just a 2009 value which is<br>inflation adjusted so in in real terms<br>we've actually gone downhill in terms of<br>spending and next we've also seen a<br>reduction in jobs per 1000 arrivals and<br>some people might say that's a great<br>thing because it's good for labor<br>productivity<br>so we've mission alized the right<br>workforce and but is that is that a good<br>goal and the last one question is the<br>value 8 that has been created by tourism<br>and every dollar spent and again in his<br>in his state stagnant I checked<br>Australia we're actually better than<br>Australia so they got that gave me a bit<br>of joy back and it hasn't increased and<br>that's really probably what we want to<br>drive next one okay so really briefly<br>before I give a bit more detail what<br>should the future look like I think in<br>chimes made it really clear it has to be<br>low carbon and because otherwise the<br>future hasn't isn't big right it has to<br>be circular economy and because we just<br>cannot afford afford to waste resources<br>it has to come from bottom up with with<br>the communities having a say and many<br>voices being represented and nature has<br>to sit at the table and New Zealand has<br>a great president with the panga nuevo<br>by having legal status and so that's<br>that's already really leading and we<br>have to move from this industrial<br>expected model to a more regenerate of<br>them next so now I'm pouring from the<br>PCE report that was mentioned in the<br>introduction in this little equation<br>which I find actually quite helpful and<br>essentially what the report argued was<br>that the the environmental pressure by<br>tourism and you can replace our solar<br>culture as well it's a combination of<br>the footprint of each activities on the<br>green box what people choose to do the<br>yellow box in how much volume will come<br>for the system and I think the green one<br>in some ways we agree so that's for<br>example the efficient<br>see of buildings of in sport so that's<br>the matter of of sort of efficiency<br>programs or conservation the politics<br>and stats and that's why put a certain<br>amount them this is essentially the<br>value versus volume debate so what do<br>people do and how how big a number of<br>tourism would be a good one for New<br>Zealand and I think that's a little bit<br>and taking your question further James<br>on is she wasn't playing what what role<br>of tourism do we want a New Zealand and<br>that inevitably links to volumes and if<br>we arrive at a point where we get<br>actually increasing returns on either<br>decreasing or stable volumes I think<br>we'd be in a very good place and to<br>qualify what return means I think we're<br>talking value or values so dollar might<br>be one value it a regional development<br>contribution to well-being to hear it<br>etc so I think that's really important<br>and answer my first question slightly<br>provocative would be in the next 12<br>months we've got the chance to really<br>find out where are the absolutely value<br>segments that we do not want to regrow<br>and I've got two candidates for that and<br>then my Beth I had research told us to<br>give out I would get a study into<br>freedom camping and really investigate<br>what's the value of it and we might be<br>surprised and cost of tourists so<br>that'll be my two suggestions<br>and on their fun next slide and<br>decarbonizing obviously I think that's<br>because that is the the big crisis<br>looming and we have legislation and<br>tourism will have to fall upon part of<br>that so we gotta do something about it<br>and I try to sort of simplify it into a<br>shift replies reduce and for example<br>five iation and it's happening in Europe<br>shifting for example well away from<br>aviation onto land transport so about<br>Germany France and investigate or invest<br>now into rail away from here we can<br>opposite to that here in New Zealand and<br>there's an electrification of lynchings<br>what's happening we can look at<br>replacing the fossil fuel and in we own<br>our aviation is the hardest but there is<br>work underway on electric aircraft for<br>short-haul or synthetic fuel for longer<br>there's a cost element to that and again<br>a volume but in theory that's something<br>I think New Zealand is an island we need<br>to invest in em or if there doesn't work<br>would use volumes and just to show you<br>that my analogy of pick to those basics<br>works for accommodation move away from<br>air-conditioning get a ceiling thin or<br>if that's still too much<br>open the window so that's kind of the<br>logic and so I just want to conclude<br>with my final slide and the beacon of<br>hope and I think this is a beacon for<br>help not only for New Zealand but I<br>think the role we play in the moment in<br>the world as a country that seems to get<br>a few things right and here's the right<br>ingredients on the table and in this new<br>economic thinking new models that are<br>being discussed and based parts of<br>government but also in the industry<br>actually in the tourism industry around<br>whether it's down at economics with<br>clinically limits whether it's<br>well-being whether it's prosperity<br>without profits if like me all of those<br>different ways of looking at what would<br>we want out of an economy and and<br>integrated this well I like this one and<br>they match its if Samari<br>it's a maori version of the donor and<br>where we can actually integrate that<br>Maori worldview that's already much more<br>interconnected with economy humans<br>nature cards it's all of course<br>connected we can't just cut out one or<br>maximize one and then don't worry about<br>the rest and things up i spaced that's<br>why I keep saying work with the<br>communities and I think we need to<br>really drive innovation and person and<br>they could be technological but also<br>service delivery experience integrating<br>culture nature back into what we call<br>not tourism industry but maybe the<br>phenomenon of Trevor something that's<br>where I leave with Chris Young and thank<br>you everyone<br>perfect thank you very much Susanna<br>that also makes a very nice transition<br>transition to the next speaker<br>and clearly that's the donor that's<br>something to ponder maybe we can revisit<br>it a little bit more detail during the<br>like a 23-19 system thank you take it<br>away James mmm<br>can I go toecutter puree everyone Thank<br>You Christian Thank You to colleagues at<br>Vick for organizing this this really<br>important event a quick hello to friends<br>and colleagues around the world who have<br>been in touch with me in the last 20<br>minutes to say we're online<br>despite their various time zones it's a<br>great opportunity to share some thoughts<br>so thank you very much I want to use my<br>10 minutes or so to begin with the<br>parliamentary commissioners report which<br>Christian briefly introduced at the top<br>of the hour<br>the parliamentary commissioners report<br>highlights problems associated with<br>sustained high tourism growth it notes<br>that tourism has eroded the very<br>attributes that make otero is such a<br>nice place to live in and also a nice<br>place to visit it's also placed enormous<br>strain on popular locations that will<br>only get worse if we continue under<br>business as usual so some of the issues<br>highlighted by the parliamentary<br>Commissioner include infrastructure<br>constraints resource pressures crowding<br>waste<br>Susanna's mentioned freedom camping it's<br>it's a classic example I think of one of<br>the issues that has has been vexing for<br>many in this country it talks about<br>concentration and bottlenecks that has<br>compromised social licence in parts of<br>New Zealand it highlights pressures on<br>the conservation estates which is valued<br>for its natural beauty its relative<br>emptiness its natural quiet and<br>qualities of solitude and it highlights<br>the vulnerabilities of the tourism<br>sector also at the global level<br>it addresses carbon constraints and our<br>reliance on markets that are on the<br>other side of the world to where we are<br>as a destination I want to propose that<br>the parliamentary commissioners report<br>calls for us to move away from<br>volume-based<br>what we might call 20th century tourism<br>it claims that Maori perspectives and<br>principles need to be at the very center<br>of this shift as Susannah has mentioned<br>of course that report was released on<br>18th of December last year right at the<br>very end of last year no one at that<br>time could have foreseen the crisis that<br>loomed in the new year the situation we<br>face now if you go to the next slide<br>Christian is that we are facing a black<br>start and a black start is a term that's<br>used in the energy sector to describe<br>trying to restart a system after a total<br>shutdown as Christian has mentioned our<br>current circumstances are completely<br>unprecedented and it's actually very<br>difficult to restart a system when it's<br>being completely shut down<br>that said covert 19 has also offered us<br>a very rare opportunity to ask some<br>important questions reflecting the<br>issues raised by the parliamentary<br>Commissioner those questions might<br>include what is the tourism that we want<br>in the future and we need to ask this of<br>all stakeholders and all actors we need<br>to know what are the parts of terrorism<br>that we want to retain and what are the<br>aspects of tourism that we don't like<br>and we want to resolve do we want to<br>return to normality we can think about<br>these questions while reflecting on our<br>covert 19 lockdown experiences which<br>have been fascinating for all of us they<br>have included working virtually less<br>time commuting less consumption less<br>congestion less noise less pollution and<br>we've also heard reports of more family<br>time more downtime more bird life more<br>birdsong we're hearing and less ventolin<br>dependence this is a funny one but I was<br>really struck by an item on the news a<br>week ago that reported a young woman<br>living in Auckland who was high risk<br>under Cove at 19 because of pre-existing<br>conditions very highly reliant on<br>ventolin inhaler because of their asthma<br>and what the lockdown proved to her what<br>it showed was that she actually began<br>reducing her ventolin dependent<br>because of lack of car fumes to the<br>point that during lockdown she actually<br>stopped using the ventolin inhaler<br>altogether and these are some of the<br>insights that I think we need to inform<br>what we want the future to look like do<br>we want to return to the relentless<br>pursuit of growth or are there<br>alternatives if there are alternatives<br>what are they what are they we need to<br>think about this really carefully at<br>this time so this run right raises<br>fundamental questions should we can we<br>use this opportunity to disrupt the<br>industry as described by the<br>parliamentary Commissioner there are<br>probably two schools of thought and if<br>you are looking at the slide with the<br>WTO and the WTTC they represent a school<br>of thought which is that we need to<br>recover as quickly as possible and these<br>organizations focus very much on people<br>on saving jobs on restoring traveler<br>confidence on recovering quickly and<br>returning to growth in tourism the<br>alternative school of thought a more<br>critical perspective as we are<br>addressing here and now is how can we<br>reimagine the future of tourism I think<br>the opportunity exists in New Zealand<br>for us to not only lead the world in<br>terms of our management of the cove at<br>19 pandemic but also to lead the<br>recovery from the crisis in terms of<br>perhaps the trans-tasman bubble on<br>reopening our borders we may be one of<br>the first in the world to restore safe<br>travel but we might also lead the world<br>in terms of rebuilding tourism for the<br>future and I now want to think about<br>that because 20th century tourism has<br>been based on moving very long distances<br>very quickly for very short durations<br>high carbon transport dependent low<br>value high impact Susana is that already<br>addressed this we need to rebuild the<br>sort of tourism that we've actually been<br>talking about for a long time and I want<br>to think a little bit about 21st century<br>tourism we're actually already two<br>decades into the 21st century so we<br>better get on with it<br>precious time has been lost but 21st<br>tourism is going to be very different it<br>has to be climate safe as James has said<br>we must decarbonize it needs to be far<br>more sustainable we need to protect our<br>environment our culture's our<br>communities our resources and it also<br>needs to be resilient this will not be<br>the last Bioshock that we face there<br>will be other pandemics there will be<br>earthquakes extreme weather events and<br>such like we need to be prepared and we<br>need to rebuild tourism at a range of<br>spatial scales so at the global scale<br>parliamentary Commissioners report calls<br>for attention to the global scale of<br>tourism impacts climate change has been<br>described as a pandemic and slow motion<br>but Susanna has alluded to this point a<br>paper was published in Nature Letters a<br>couple of days ago titled how the corona<br>virus has slashed carbon emissions and<br>the scale of reduction of emissions this<br>year is similar to what we need to be<br>able to sustain year in year out in<br>order to make the Paris climate<br>objectives however if we look at the<br>2008 global financial crisis emissions<br>quickly recovered and returned to<br>business as usual we cannot allow this<br>to happen we need to have climate<br>conscious tourism policy we need our<br>tourism policy to recognize that there<br>is a car high carbon cost associated<br>with tourism that tourism GDP comes with<br>a high carbon footprint that we've got<br>some real challenges and decarbonizing<br>tourism because although the industry<br>has achieved some gains and<br>decarbonizing it's been overwhelmed by<br>growth in visitor volume and we need to<br>benchmark ourselves against other<br>sectors so you highlight how we're<br>tracking and how much more we need to do<br>to mitigate our tourism carbon emissions<br>we've already seen that transportation<br>is at the absolute part of this problem<br>so we need to tackle aviation I have a<br>slide here that looks at some of the<br>things that we might want to start<br>thinking about quite quickly when<br>to think about inbound travel outbound<br>travel and we also need to think about<br>domestic regional air travel dependence<br>the current technical regime is locked<br>in there are no silver bullets on the<br>horizon we are dependent on long-haul<br>markets we are going to have to get<br>offsets we're going to have to get<br>tourists to pay to offset their<br>emissions if those emissions are<br>unavoidable as they are in the case of<br>air travel and that offset funding has<br>to be invested in the development and<br>maintenance of sustainable tourism<br>systems of this country we've got to<br>have low-carbon transitions but it's<br>also interesting to see that Airlines<br>many airlines now are dependent on<br>government bailout packages some<br>countries adding so-called green<br>conditions to bail out terms the French<br>government has banned Air France from<br>serving domestic routes that compete<br>with high-speed rail that's an<br>infrastructures in place to allow for<br>these modal shifts we need to get a move<br>on with facilitating these sorts of<br>modal shifts also in France taxes to<br>support low-carbon investment in<br>alternative transport modes the other<br>thing that's come through is the growing<br>importance of domestic tourism and in<br>many parts of the world domestic tourism<br>is the foundation of the tourism<br>industry we have neglected our domestic<br>tourism too long and we need to that<br>transform that into a long term<br>commitment to our domestic and regional<br>markets next slide at the national scale<br>the focus here needs to be on national<br>transport networks the cruise center<br>needs to come under close scrutiny it<br>has a very high environmental cost we<br>need to move from domestic flights and<br>private vehicle use to invest in<br>sustainable transport infrastructures<br>within this country and to encourage<br>businesses to innovate finally the local<br>level we need resilient and regenerative<br>tourism at the local level the problem<br>we have is that tourists in most cases<br>pay for the resources that they consume<br>whether it's water or waste or<br>infrastructure or or solitude in the<br>national parks the burden typically<br>falls on ratepayers<br>and some of the resources that tourism<br>tourists consume were actually never<br>intended for them to consume at all by<br>going to quiet beaches that are now<br>being overrun by tourists to see our<br>populations of wild animals so we need<br>buiness businesses to innovate in<br>regenerative tourism and there are some<br>great examples of this happening now<br>businesses that engage in funding<br>wildlife science predator control<br>wildlife hospitals plantings beach<br>cleanups offsetting donating to<br>conservation causes signing petitions<br>all sorts of ways that we can refocus on<br>regenerative tourism and we need to be<br>thinking about that my last slide<br>summarizes the different scales at which<br>we need to act to pursue 21st century<br>tourism as I'm beginning to explain it<br>we need to think comprehensively about<br>how we act at different scales of<br>analysis to enact a new form of tourism<br>my final slide suggests that we have an<br>opportunity for disruption historians<br>argue that the 20th century actually<br>began in 1914 which obviously is the<br>date of the first world war which swept<br>away the old Victorian ways that have<br>continued into the 20th century I'd like<br>to think that in future we might reflect<br>that the 21st century of sustainable<br>tourism began in 2020 with the covert<br>crisis it's been said previously that<br>it's only in crisis that we can produce<br>real change but as Milton Friedman said<br>in 1982 when the crisis occurs the<br>actions that are taken depend on the<br>ideas that are lying around at the time<br>so we need to start talking France so<br>much about the problems they're well<br>rehearsed we know that well we need to<br>make sure at this time that good ideas<br>are available and I've<br>finished by saying that the<br>parliamentary Commissioner will produce<br>a second report with policy<br>recommendations and I would argue that<br>there has never been a more timely and<br>important report to make policy<br>recommendations to government as to how<br>we might tackle the issues that we face<br>and move towards 21st century tourism<br>Accura thank you very much wonderful<br>thank you very much James<br>I didn't mind reached James's thoughts I<br>did have a cheat sheet but it may have<br>been slightly out of touch when I<br>changed the different slides but<br>hopefully that worked I would love to be<br>able to read James's mind but I don't<br>think it's gonna happen okay so now we<br>shift over to the Q&amp;A sessions if you<br>have additional questions please add<br>them to the Q&amp;A and I will handle the<br>two eviant Colette to read out the first<br>question please and to direct it at the<br>panelists wonderful Thank You Christian<br>we have some wonderful questions going<br>over on the Q&amp;A chat box which you are<br>able to continue to ask questions as we<br>do this process as Christiane said this<br>first question I'm going to direct<br>towards James Hyman as it touches on<br>something you just talked about and<br>that's the idea of Industry and<br>government working together you<br>reference that in your discussion on<br>aviation and made reference for example<br>France so your words please on how you<br>see industry and government working<br>together please well we've got a great<br>track record in this country of Industry<br>and government working closely together<br>and that is continuing through the coda<br>crisis the tourism industry otherö<br>leads the the industry voice in this<br>country working closely with the key<br>ministry the Ministry of business<br>innovation and employment and obviously<br>tourism New Zealand faces in huge<br>challenges at the moment to refocus from<br>its extremely successful historically<br>very successful international marketing<br>campaigns so our focus<br>on the domestic market and there's a an<br>enormous challenge there because it's<br>been neglected for a long time and where<br>we're really starting from scratch in<br>how we are going to go about marketing<br>to domestic tourists so there are lots<br>of players in the tourism system there<br>are lots of actors there are lots of<br>stakeholders I've named three of the key<br>groups obviously but more broadly<br>speaking I think Susannah has alluded to<br>this we need communities involved we<br>need the public voice we need the key<br>players in the tourism system as very<br>widely defined to to be empowered to<br>have a voice on what the future of<br>tourism might hold I don't know if that<br>answers the question but happy to speak<br>more on that I think it definitely adds<br>some nice contact because it needs a<br>comprehensive stakeholder framework to<br>not just be talked about but to be<br>applied I think for every member of that<br>stakeholder framework has a has a voice<br>but I think Susannah might also like to<br>speak to this and yes I was just<br>thinking that and also because I saw the<br>original question which did refer also<br>to other countries developing countries<br>in particular not only New Zealand and<br>and I've worked in a number of also for<br>example Pacific Islands my impression is<br>that sometimes the evidence base is<br>lacking and I think even some of the<br>questions here where for example how<br>valuable is domestic tourism how<br>valuable push a person where governments<br>might develop certain policy because and<br>so this is not New Zealand this is<br>another place that I'm having in mind by<br>saying this external interests coming in<br>convincing government you need a big<br>cruise ship terminal and because it's<br>good for you and there's not enough data<br>evidence insights into what that<br>actually truly means in terms are very<br>generated for the country and so<br>policies or things are permitted and<br>often under the banner of a projects<br>that actually ultimately undermine I<br>think the future of the country<br>potentially more and less because they<br>weren't researched well so that's I<br>think about having really good evidence<br>about the true benefit in costume for<br>thank you very much can I now sift over<br>to a different focus which is what is<br>Maori values proposition that could<br>contribute to the future of sustainable<br>tourism would you like to start with<br>this one sorry you just cut out their<br>thanks for still yeah that's a really<br>good question and I think it's it's very<br>pertinent the whole the way we think<br>about the environment really would<br>benefit from taking a totally Matauranga<br>Maori<br>viewpoint it's really about loving well<br>Suzanne showed the the doughnut are the<br>the Maori doughnut of a Maori doughnut I<br>mean oh absolutely right we have to live<br>with an Eric and on economic and<br>ecological<br>means and take a really holistic view of<br>who we are and how we fit in to the<br>environment<br>so I think taking a sort of TR Maori<br>approach to tourism and to economic<br>activity generally would be hugely<br>beneficial to the environment and and<br>ultimately to the economy and of<br>sustainability all the - Susannah and<br>thank you and I'm by no means an expert<br>in this space but my understanding is<br>that the Mari viewers of the sea and<br>want much more balanced one and we've<br>obviously really prioritized the<br>economic dimension in the past and an<br>interesting fact and that I learned<br>recently is that there's now Mary wait<br>for external cost there's a survey<br>that's done to him because we produce<br>external costs and in the Maya world<br>there's no such thing because whatever<br>is an output becomes a minus input so I<br>think there's there's a lot of guidance<br>excellent thank you and I can see that<br>in the questions one about economics is<br>rising which was just talked about so<br>let's address that one where does<br>economic sustainability fit into the mix<br>can I chuck this in James hyams<br>direction sure it's a really important<br>question<br>you know we're focusing a lot on on non<br>economic factors that have become really<br>front of mind and are really important<br>but tourism is of course also an<br>economic activity so so it's it's a<br>really important question but when the<br>question is raised it kind of takes me<br>back to James Renwick's presentation<br>because if we don't get on top of<br>climate change then economic prosperity<br>and future will be will be lost so the<br>stakes are very high and you know I<br>think certainly in the short and medium<br>term there are going to be fewer<br>tourists there are going to be fewer<br>tourists flying in the air there are<br>going to be fewer tourists flying<br>long-haul particularly given the the<br>crisis that is confronting the aviation<br>industry<br>Susanna has alluded to the importance of<br>value-added<br>she's alluded to the importance of<br>optimizing our tourism markets so one of<br>the challenges that we face and we need<br>good science to inform decisions in<br>these areas is what two discrete markets<br>bring to the table what do they bring in<br>terms of their environmental costs and<br>their environmental burdens but also<br>what do they bring in terms of their<br>economic impacts to the New Zealand<br>economy but also what do they bring to a<br>regional dispersal into regional<br>communities and regional destinations<br>part of the problem we've faced in the<br>past is concentration of tourism and<br>huge pressures on bottlenecks or high<br>profile destinations well many other<br>parts of the country are largely empty<br>so we need to think about optimization<br>and we need to think about how we<br>optimize our key markets in ways that<br>clearly include carbon foot<br>a tourist coming from Australia eastern<br>seaboard Australia to New Zealand has<br>about thirteen percent of the carbon<br>footprint of someone coming from Europe<br>so we can think about how we optimize<br>markets and environmental in social and<br>in economic terms and that is going to<br>be really important in the future thank<br>you for that I'm mindful of time but I<br>you know it would be great for all<br>panelists to talk to this point but I'm<br>interested in a comment that Susanna<br>made earlier about freedom campus and I<br>think that ties into the economic<br>discussion and I heard on the rate on<br>their news of this I couldn't verify<br>this anymore that someone in Queenstown<br>I think put on a a petition to ban<br>freedom camping once we come back from<br>lockdown as a as a fresh start and then<br>I saw that the person withdrew it<br>because she had received threats and on<br>the basis of that withdrew their<br>petitions what does that mean about<br>tourism in New Zealand and what does<br>that mean about how far these practices<br>have established themselves and how many<br>important stakeholders are wrong<br>involved basically it was economically<br>driven<br>the petitioner said why was it then with<br>joy<br>you just browse you just browse for<br>moment that you want me to provide some<br>pose<br>I thought Susana would be excellent for<br>this yes okay and so I think what does<br>this show it's obviously a show us that<br>freedom camping is an extremely<br>polarized political fall in New Zealand<br>that's number one it confirms what I<br>suggested earlier we actually need some<br>really good data on it could actually be<br>that only certain types of freedom<br>kenting generate greater cost and<br>benefit and others are actually really<br>producing their value that I talked<br>about I actually could see even how that<br>emerges and this is why I think also<br>about the question and concerning the<br>economy earlier we need to actually be a<br>bit more clear what we mean by the<br>economy and of course in the past it's<br>may be maximizing profit for a<br>relatively small this is also questions<br>about distributions and what other<br>metrics we're looking for is it<br>employment is that equitable<br>distribution and what other models said<br>even say something like like thinking<br>freedom camping we can actually drive<br>some of those economic outcomes by<br>people for example engaging in<br>activities that generate high employment<br>in the regions for example so I guess<br>what I'm saying it's not quite as black<br>and white as I may be also try to make<br>it athletics but this is where we need<br>to be quite clear on what is the value<br>proposition of Troezen<br>what's the policy goal and in how do we<br>get them thank you and I suspect also<br>you know the democratization of travel<br>comes into this where we the<br>international freedom campus do have a<br>particular group that is that's<br>financially resourced to do it at the<br>same time they provide a good resource<br>for the the low-skilled workplaces<br>around New Zealand it's a really complex<br>and interesting question that I've been<br>also following for a while but<br>definitely one that I think needs to be<br>discussed as we re-enter into this<br>reimagine world it's our opportunity<br>and if I can change over to a question<br>that is directed to those Anna or James<br>your thoughts on managing tourism in our<br>hotspots in national parks such as<br>Milford the glaciers tongariro national<br>park and Susannah had started answering<br>that in the chat version so I would like<br>to hand it over to James hi and turn his<br>thoughts sure thank you and thanks for<br>the question<br>it's it's an issue that's highlighted by<br>the parliamentary Commissioner our most<br>natural and beautiful<br>resources have come under enormous<br>pressure the tongariro crossing is a<br>classic example of this my own sense is<br>that we need stronger government and<br>policy in all of these areas we need to<br>realize that that demand can very easily<br>overwhelm supply of such valuable<br>experiences and we need to manage those<br>experiences very very carefully to<br>safeguard them I've said previously that<br>in many parts of the world you pay to go<br>into national parks there are booking<br>systems there are user pays systems no<br>one complains I think when you go to<br>beautiful national parks it's it's it's<br>worth paying a sum for that for the<br>absolute privilege of doing so I read a<br>year or so ago I may be corrected on<br>this that the Great Walks in New Zealand<br>operated at financial costs to the<br>Department of Conservation that the<br>costs of actually developing and<br>maintaining and providing those<br>experiences on the Great Walks isn't<br>recouped even though we now have a<br>tiered costing system for such<br>experiences it seems to me absolutely<br>remarkable that the taxpayer would be<br>effectively subsidizing what is absolute<br>premier national park experiences in in<br>the Great Walks so we need to think<br>about how we meet the costs of providing<br>these sorts of experiences and how we<br>meet the costs of maintaining the<br>various<br>courses that tourists use and consume<br>when they're here so those are some<br>initial thoughts I might just add really<br>briefly because both James and I<br>mentioned the word innovation in our<br>presentation and this is where I think<br>we can we can do a little bit of<br>innovation for example working I don't<br>know if any of you have seen these<br>pop-up hotels I've seen them somewhere<br>else in the world so they're temporary<br>structures that you could put up in a<br>scenic spot for example for tourist<br>accommodation quite funky design they<br>could be operated by a third party and<br>for example Department of Conservation<br>works with them leave no impacts I think<br>in because we talked about in economic<br>opportunity so here's a here's an<br>opportunity for an entrepreneur to come<br>up with ideas of how we can use maybe<br>conservation land in different ways that<br>allow impact and generate economic<br>activity I think there's one for that<br>thank you<br>and in response this will be our final<br>question in response to a question about<br>few suggestions for implementation<br>issues the question basically asks is it<br>going to be a a best all the ideas that<br>we previously had approach or do we need<br>to adopt a more nuanced approach for<br>example to freedom camping and to cruise<br>cruise tourism so the question itself I<br>think is a bit too detailed to go into<br>but could each of you leave us with one<br>core implementation suggestion that you<br>could put to government that you think<br>is going to be a core part of<br>reimagining New Zealand Post Cove at 19<br>and please don't all just talk about<br>climate change can we start with James<br>hi James Renwick please<br>literally and I won't mention those two<br>words so I think for me and that graphic<br>that Susanna showed before about the<br>tourist numbers versus the tourist<br>dollars tells a real story I think we<br>need to try and move towards a quality<br>over quantity model where perhaps less<br>people come to New Zealand but they come<br>for a really rich experience and for<br>some depths and the experience they have<br>I can only imagine that tourism has<br>become more superficial over time more<br>people traveling but this less of a<br>meaningful experience let's say so I'd<br>love to see some marketing if coming<br>from government agencies and and<br>business selling the idea of New Zealand<br>as a destination we can really have a<br>high quality experience thank you answer<br>yes oh here's an idea so when you go to<br>Bhutan you actually have to hire a local<br>guide now I haven't been to Bhutan<br>because I'm too scared to fly into their<br>Airport but anyway I would have to have<br>a local guide and so so there's actually<br>twice as a museum where this is starting<br>to happen with the representative of a<br>local EB to generate employment get the<br>right stories get people to take time<br>and I think why not certain types of<br>chosen weather school ships at the<br>Burien they have to when they come on<br>sure they have to give our guys I don't<br>know it's just an idea<br>excellent thank you very much and James<br>hi thank you Christian<br>a couple of concluding thoughts to<br>address this question I think we've<br>alluded to some of the open questions<br>some of the things that we need to know<br>more about we talked about optimizing<br>markets for example we need good science<br>to inform decision-making so the onus<br>will be on on the right research<br>questions being addressed rigorously to<br>inform pathways forward I actually think<br>that forums like this these sorts of<br>webinars are a fantastic opportunity to<br>share ideas to put forward the sorts of<br>ideas that might need to be available to<br>inform the future<br>and to repeat what I said right at the<br>end of my presentation<br>the parliamentary commissioners first<br>report was extremely comprehensive and<br>really identifies the challenges that we<br>face his second report to make policy<br>recommendations to government I think<br>we'll be in a critically important<br>pathway forward and to the strong<br>government and the policy initiatives<br>that we need to create the new tourism<br>that we want for the future excellent<br>thank you very much I'm very mindful of<br>the preparation of pulling this together<br>and giving it a theme and for inviting<br>me to chair this but I have to take I<br>have to say I can't take much credit for<br>much of what happens here I just try to<br>help bring it together so thank you to<br>you and before I thank the speakers also<br>very quickly a basically an<br>advertisement for the upcoming webinars<br>to try and continuous Americas will try<br>to bring together different perspectives<br>and 25th and for details just go to the<br>Wellington you know Wellington<br>University website our foursome and<br>events yes the called Victoria but it's<br>not in there in the URL and then I would<br>also like to thank our excellent<br>presenters for sharing their expertise<br>thank you to James Renda chooses a<br>napkin that you James hi and was a</p></main><footer
