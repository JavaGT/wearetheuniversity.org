font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Kia ora, what I've learned over the last few<br>weeks has been the importance of being able<br>to get outside and get some fresh air.<br>I've learned that I've missed the daily contact<br>with all of my colleagues in ALPSS and across<br>the university.<br>Organisational communication works best when<br>there's a border collie involved.<br>Working from home can be a real challenge<br>when you've got your family around you so<br>it's important that they understand the boundaries<br>between your work life and your home life<br>"Dad can we play football", Ewan, I'm trying to<br>make a video!<br>This lockdown has been a challenging time<br>for everyone but I hope, like us, you've found<br>the odd moment of lightheartedness to enjoy<br>along the way.<br>One of the things I've learned in lockdown<br>is that you have to have a great coffee maker.<br>I didn't have a coffee maker up until just<br>hours before lockdown, I thought no, too expensive<br>too extravagant.<br>My sister worked it out, how much would the<br>coffee maker be in relation to your mortgage<br>payment, I thought hmmm ok alright I'll do<br>it!<br>It has saved my life! This coffee maker has<br>been absolutely amazing.<br>During lockdown, we've obviously all become<br>very good users of Zoom.<br>But I'd like to address some of the security<br>issues that Zoom is known to have, and how<br>I've solved them at home.<br>To do that, I'm going to introduce to you<br>to a couple of members of my bubble.<br>This is Rhubarb, a German Wirehead Pointer,<br>and this is Begel, don't worry she's a Cornish Rex<br>she's meant to look like that.<br>Only compatible with windows.<br>One thing that I've learned, well not so much<br>learned but been reminded of is just how committed<br>the staff are to the institution and just<br>their willingness to do whatever it takes<br>in order to keep the organisation running,<br>to keep our students learning, and to keep<br>our research going and it's been amazing.<br>Hi fellow bubblers, as a newbie to the area<br>I'm enjoying getting around Hamilton and enjoying<br>the sites and the weather over the lockdown.<br>Another thing getting me through is coffee,<br>my son bequeathed me a coffee machine when<br>he moved away and I've learned some barista<br>skills over the last few weeks.<br>I've spent lockdown at home on my own and<br>because of that, it's been important to me<br>to have a bit of structure in my working day<br>so that I can find a bit of separation between<br>work life and home life.<br>My biggest highlight has been the introduction<br>of this guy.<br>During COVID19 and the countrywide lockdown,<br>my research has lead to the discovery of the<br>perfect peanut butter, chocolate chip, raisin,<br>and oatmeal cookie with smarties on top.<br>The secret is nutmeg and Whittaker's chocolate.<br>I've learned that being home with my family<br>and juggling work and unexpected interruptions<br>can actually be a wonderful thing.<br>And if it hadn't been for that, I wouldn't<br>have seen my youngest boy Tommy learn to ride<br>his bike for the first time, and I'm really<br>thankful for that.<br>Here's an example of the skill development,<br>our ancient scrabble board, I've been trying<br>to improve my vocabulary, I'm sure it's getting<br>much better.<br>Kia ora e hoa ma, one thing that I'm really<br>grateful for in the lockdown is being able<br>to flow from the busyness of emails and phone<br>calls and Zoom hui through to quality time<br>with the whƒÅnau, looking after our taha wairua,<br>taha tinana, taha hinengaro and for that,<br>I'm truly grateful.<br>Sitting at my desk at home, I've had the pleasure<br>of seeing and hearing our local birdlife.<br>Visitors to our bubble have included tui,<br>quail, kingfisher, and fantail.<br>You could say that I've enjoyed zoom hui - zui<br>- and tui!<br>I've been absolutely blown away by, you know,<br>people's ability to come together, to think<br>of new ways of doing things.<br>You know, whether that's you know the staff<br>at the University or students and our international<br>partners and even my children, you know everybody<br>is really thinking of ways to do things differently.<br>One thing that I've learned in lockdown is<br>how incredibly valuable I find it having diverse<br>perspectives around me to call on.<br>It's not insurmountable on Zoom, but the ability<br>to take a walk around campus and bounce ideas<br>around with someone gives me that combination<br>of walking, thinking, talking, that I find<br>incredibly valuable.<br>On the flip side, I've yet to master creating<br>an activity which keeps a four-year-old entertained<br>for longer than 20 minutes.<br>" Mummy, can you please come and help me".<br>Over and out.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
