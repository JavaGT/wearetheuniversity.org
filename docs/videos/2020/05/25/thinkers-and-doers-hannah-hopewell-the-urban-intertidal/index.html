is<br>about the presenters the urban<br>intertidal in other scoping parentheses<br>is a provocative presentation that draws<br>on thought outside landscape<br>architecture is genealogy and<br>disciplinary ideals asking what forms of<br>seeing might prefer under the idea of<br>non landscape in a context of the<br>coloniality several experimental scope<br>it's are discussed in their significance<br>to broaden in critical modes<br>of landscape practice we will have a tea<br>and some time for questions and but<br>without further ado please join me in<br>giving the warm welcome to<br>Henan<br>tena koutou katoa if you want hello to<br>you all out there and thank you for<br>signing in and making the space of this<br>session he ought to thank you to the NC<br>de la Wellington branch and the cold<br>thompson for this invitation and the<br>wellington school of architecture<br>especially bruno marcus for your<br>excellent organization at the beginning<br>now i'm a little clunky here given i<br>couldn't print anything and i've got two<br>computers in front of me and no mouse so<br>I'm a little yeah uncomfortable but lit<br>let's begin<br>all right here we go if you begin so the<br>aim of this short presentation that's<br>Bruno has outlined is is to introduce<br>several experimental and radicalized<br>ways of seeing that may provoke<br>possibilities the fracturing the<br>dominant modes of order regards to<br>landscape visuality as outlined these<br>approaches to seeing arise from my<br>concern with a perennial issue whereby<br>lens that bridge realities as both<br>constitutively and currently mobilized<br>and indeed naturalized are on the one<br>hand entangled in a Eurocentric<br>universalism of image and on the other<br>the marketer magnetization of the earth<br>and thus emblematic of various forms of<br>violence we call colonization under such<br>conditions what is called for is more<br>than new spatial imaginaries but do we<br>invent new means of prob what it is to<br>imagine so motivation to depart from<br>naturalized ways of seeing arose from<br>where I find myself quite plainly as<br>part of the many forms of subtle and<br>pronounced existence that make the world<br>visible he also heard of a machine that<br>cuts and dices denying the world for<br>color a world with whiteness is so<br>pervasive rendered unseen and<br>housebroken<br>it is a betwixt place one that doesn't<br>go here at me fit into the firm shapes<br>made to cook things in universal shapes<br>like landscape architect or poet in fact<br>I describe it as a non place quietly and<br>slowly manifesting by way of a holding<br>back turning away and stepping over the<br>confining lines of orthodoxy its non<br>place however as a founding an<br>idiosyncratic mode of transfer Celyn<br>quiring<br>conscious of the politic that it<br>performs he's alongside energies of many<br>others who are concerned with the deep<br>politicization of landscape practices in<br>recent this as recent discourse his is<br>vigorously showing this inquiry is a<br>becoming aware of the multiple ways<br>domination hides in the landscape to<br>avoid getting trip<br>by the clerks of Kobuk power it baths<br>and provides a practice under the rubric<br>of D coloniality one that acts on the<br>legitimate and landscape summative<br>thought decoupling from Eurocentric<br>ambitions of modernity the start of<br>scholarship taken has no interest in<br>aiming its experimental scope of tools<br>at anything other than a response to<br>localized instances and which they used<br>hence what I sketch here is not a<br>counter practice it has no strikes on<br>trumping or any form of generalized or<br>reproducible application instead my<br>interest is in the condition conditions<br>within which alternative ways of<br>perceiving and representing landscape<br>can emerge enter into discussion build<br>understandings that both can test the<br>totalizing claims and political<br>epistemic violence of modernity while<br>being a gene tech to the creation and<br>performance of new relational shapes of<br>seeing by introduction these apparatus<br>or skopic technologies the ways of<br>seeing and thus thinking are not<br>governed by the spatial codes and linear<br>temporal ization opportunity nor do they<br>emerge from the esteem of the pre-modern<br>or the indigenous but improvised by a<br>strand of non-standard thinking and<br>convergence with what has been come to<br>known as a general ecology or ecology<br>unbound from the modern idea of nature<br>that is alongside the physical practice<br>of encountering the urban landscape so<br>whilst not adhering to a prescribed<br>field as such the project is a<br>speculative form of realism in so far it<br>explores ways of conceiving the urban<br>landscape the human and dependently of<br>its relationship to the cop to cognitive<br>forms or phenomenology I've used these<br>ways of seeing in a writing practice I<br>named pair affectional a type of field<br>poetics or sight writing of the everyday<br>urban landscapes of like capitalism but<br>before I<br>I moved to that piece of work I firstly<br>want to speak to the problem regards to<br>Seminole landscape virtuality<br>to reinforce the deep entanglement of<br>landscape and welding forms of trauma so<br>it's well-established that landscape and<br>power are constitutively related in such<br>a way that is central to the colonial<br>control and classification of space land<br>and people landscape is an image it's<br>critical to this bearing in fact as<br>James corner States landscape and image<br>is inseparable with our image there is<br>no such thing as landscape only<br>unmediated environment the politic that<br>lies and what kind of image what kind of<br>image of thought is deployed it is<br>because of the role of landscape<br>visuality and the political imaginary we<br>should continue to explore its continued<br>visual construction Paul Carter points<br>out the modern concept of landscape<br>emerges as a key rhetorical term and the<br>vocabulary of unprecedented internal as<br>well as external colonization thus<br>honing subjectivity whilst extending and<br>appropriating physical territories this<br>the landscape way of seeing the<br>landscape image therefore brings with it<br>more than just spatial code it sutures<br>epistemological Authority to power and<br>renders this association naturalized<br>within the cosmology of the moderns<br>modernity is bruno latour reminds us<br>means Seleucia experience of relations<br>thereby asserting ex of division cut and<br>carving out categorizations of the<br>discrete spheres to separate out the<br>viewer from the view the subject from<br>the object the future from the past the<br>human from the nonhuman the individual<br>from the collective such binaries are<br>set within a default narrative of<br>progression envisioned of linear time<br>keeping its fuel for domination and<br>exclusion charging epistemological<br>authority against other ways of knowing<br>and being such as the blind spot of<br>whiteness similarly in a scoff Goa<br>critics and Ellenberger to him<br>articulates landscape as a way of seeing<br>a cop<br>and structuring of the world so that it<br>may be appropriated by a detached<br>individual spectator<br>and structuring of the world so maybe<br>sorry to whom an illusion of order and<br>control with offered through the<br>composition of space according to<br>certain geometries landscape he writes<br>the distances us from the world in<br>critical ways defining a particular<br>relationship with nature and those who<br>appear in nature it complements the real<br>power humans exert by the land is<br>property while seemingly it aligned to<br>individualistic self-examination Acula<br>equalization WT w JT mitchell and<br>landscaping up in power reinforces the<br>Westerners of landscape its modernity<br>and it's visual pictorial essence and<br>further that the rides and development<br>of landscape was a symptom of rise and<br>development of capitalism the harmony<br>sword and landscape<br>greed it's compensation for screening<br>off acts of violence penetrated their<br>the historical narratives landscapes<br>generate a tailor-made for the discourse<br>of imperialism he writes we buy an<br>expansion of landscape it's understood<br>as an imitable progress development in<br>history an expansion of culture and<br>civilization into a nature space and a<br>progress that is itself narrated it's<br>natural<br>thus landscape becomes the medium to<br>express extension outwardness in space<br>in a way is it's a way of moving forward<br>in time the prospect that opens up is<br>not just a spatial one but a projected<br>future of development and exploitation<br>like imperialism itself landscape<br>becomes a representational practice<br>reflecting how cultures could imagine<br>their wealthy destiny in an underground<br>prospect of endless appropriation and<br>conquest<br>as the disc messages of this<br>constitutive landscape image ads today<br>still active of course landscape<br>practice it's no lot no longer recent<br>I'll ignore as its so seduced by the<br>pictorial as contemplative we now have<br>also the prevalence of the<br>my knowledge and the relational image in<br>summary landscape architecture has<br>witnessed are significant and critically<br>influential shift and representational<br>intentions in the last twenty years<br>mainly in resistance to the Sina<br>for example James corners addictive<br>methods<br>the temporal ization of complexity Emin<br>straited and many of the down through<br>part 2006 competition ecologic sub<br>process and forms of periodization such<br>as phonology along with embodied<br>practices practices that are more<br>relational engaged with how landscapes<br>are produced and lived in fact we've<br>seen the arrival of the non<br>representational image and design<br>purpose as engagements with happenings<br>and events I anticipate there will be<br>significant critique to come of the<br>ecological edge in its smoothing of<br>neoliberal moves however as the<br>constitutive landscape practice still<br>active<br>does this perspective continue to assert<br>a hallucinatory continue to assert a<br>hallucination spatial truth a realistic<br>image despite the absence of a viewer<br>don't we still speak to the theatre of<br>foreground and background does the<br>promise of prospect drive the privilege<br>and marketization of use or organize how<br>recreation trails are marked out there<br>for how the earth and along with it the<br>even subject is rated so that's<br>considered the horizon as a projective<br>imagery and which the landscape image is<br>complicit the horizon according to<br>anthropologist Elizabeth probe analogy<br>is vital to liberalism it's toxic in<br>continued and irritation of the earth<br>horizons are open they shift and we<br>enter them and they in turn move with us<br>they deploy a spatial imaginary to break<br>it all forms of violence incurred as a<br>result of unintended and unfortunate<br>unfoldings of lake modernity xym<br>dialectic in this way the law of the<br>horizon keeps the real from ever landing<br>it allows the effacement of finishing<br>the minimizing of ongoing Glenn Chalmers<br>with us with an assumed Nort of<br>orientation and speculative rule of<br>sorry specific rule of law it is the<br>horizon that forges<br>delicious absorption of entire worlds<br>into their react regimes of capitalism<br>with an apology that should have been<br>that should have been done more gently<br>with more cultural and social<br>sensitivity it is the horizon that<br>allows the nerve to be given cultural<br>and social values such as Matata Mali<br>but at the same time policies police's<br>rather anything that will be actually<br>it's actually sweetened the skeleton<br>principle which gives the body of law<br>its shape and internal consistency it is<br>the horizon that I wish endure unseen so<br>was it to think the urban landscape<br>without these relics kopecks imposing<br>their claim design entanglements no<br>prospector no perspective no horizon or<br>in fact without the assumed consent to<br>be a single individual from we're<br>therefore if not myself and my<br>suggesting one does this scene this is<br>the spirit of project some of my recent<br>work is provisionally intended and to<br>which I will now turn as a caution<br>during its likely you will find aspects<br>of my practice chal challenge for<br>comprehension<br>it is perhaps disorientation estranging<br>using ways of seeing unrecognizable the<br>image of thought not quite graspable<br>possibly offering very little relevance<br>to your established practices of<br>engaging with the landscape image I<br>forewarn this terrain and which this<br>provisional work occurs builds on its<br>fall on its non-place lessness and is<br>best described as a non landscape not a<br>loci in opposition counterparts to or<br>fought to a fault or false to the real<br>landscape but an idea alongside<br>coexistent or on a different plane that<br>is in its difference it is another name<br>for landscape unbound from modernities<br>binary based opposition's<br>and he's a customer logical scope it<br>drives in the seats non place no sorry<br>non landscape is not let's get not it's<br>not landscapes other in advance I thank<br>you for bearing with me and allowing<br>this transdisciplinary and rather French<br>scholarship to try this performative<br>thought within the landscape frame if I<br>mentioned<br>this research theoretically emerges at<br>the posthuman variant from a convergence<br>of general ecology there is a ecology<br>without nature and non standard theory I<br>will bypass explaining this couple<br>context other than to name the thought<br>of Francois lore'l very influential what<br>follows outlines a little account the<br>scope acts and operationally unveiled<br>and sketch how the urban into title in<br>the stranger as I call them occurs whose<br>they are constructed the urban enter<br>title in the stranger and non-human<br>scope it's formed in superposition with<br>the urban landscape is a non<br>representational practice the screen but<br>I hope that your mind is free of image<br>so the the primary operation of this<br>work it's called the non the non is<br>coming from L'Oreal's non-standard and<br>as the catalyzing agent offering a<br>sidestepping of governing orders that<br>promulgate the ruling motifs of urban<br>and landscape discourse it is the key<br>methodological feature affording thought<br>to radicalize or to shift into<br>superposition I do not think about the<br>non but with it and significantly it<br>offers new experiences of thought it<br>brings an aberrant mode of operation a<br>practice and material behavior the non<br>ex positively making tools of thought<br>physical it really makes tombs as they<br>are lived bypassing functional<br>signification at the level of the<br>signifier thinking what this non becomes<br>part of the real rather than becoming<br>understood as bit as in tations of it my<br>writing practice of pair of sectioning<br>uses this non informing distinct bodies<br>with urban waterfront landscapes the<br>knot is not concerned with exerting<br>overt oppositional force there was no<br>dialectical movement for example non<br>landscape is not landscapes other nor<br>non-human is humans other the second<br>operation I'll introduce is<br>superposition the superposition names<br>the property in position it offers a<br>place for the experience of thought when<br>we be enduring binaries and modernity in<br>its linear<br>temporalis II cannot take holes with a<br>normative means of the human as an<br>individual agent knowing subject and<br>soliciting subject B is no meaning it<br>creates a new world and the in the right<br>here now<br>the term superposition comes from<br>quantum physics and references the real<br>existence of all quantum states as they<br>are superposed superposition outlines<br>this method logical and outlines our<br>method logical analog analogizing<br>gesture over non esthetics affection by<br>which thinking itself becomes an<br>embodied material participation and not<br>a representational mode of the true of<br>all the false following the logic of<br>superposition past present and future<br>exist as an effect to time to issue a<br>flowing thickness of a future you'll now<br>so with brevity I want to emphasize that<br>despite the labour of these technical<br>operations the orientation of this work<br>is geared towards a subtle texture of<br>encounter with the everyday landscape as<br>most broadly construed so the first of<br>these topics I call the urban intertidal<br>and this is focused on sustaining ways<br>of seeing time alternatively to capital<br>time it names the clone of the tide and<br>locates recursive temporality folded<br>into the urban everyday and it turns to<br>the generic rhythm or temporal economy<br>of movement and in this way the urban<br>intertidal moves without a boundary but<br>with a guiding age that's always in the<br>last instance showing up a circulation<br>that cannot hold like a time machine<br>removed from any inflationary time the<br>urban intertidal flows as an on space<br>the acuity that can never be filled<br>becoming a performative scrap of<br>technology for composing as if from<br>everywhere yet without invoking any<br>sense whatsoever of interior or exterior<br>aren t the analogy my impetus for<br>involving this technology is to use it<br>somewhat like a nonhuman and embitter a<br>walking kind mechanism in much the same<br>way as even researched during the 20th<br>century adopted the<br>Walker is the city two means of plural<br>perspective revenant - Tyler is also a<br>skopic technology for focusing on event<br>or non ground or non place territory<br>within a realm of the urban that I call<br>non human it is also a way of<br>constituting a movement that resists<br>axial extension resists accumulative<br>position and that doesn't see the point<br>of the city but feels it's precious here<br>I use its urban intertidal for defining<br>contour including moments all together<br>eluding any particularity of a moment's<br>content in other words the urban enter<br>tile composes time along with the Tecna<br>city that not only allows time to go<br>both ways but as well the next aesthetic<br>the suspended to have descents of<br>everyday finitude the time of the urban<br>intertidal is thus pervading EHD<br>realized and different - yet enduring<br>alongside the urban or world time the<br>urban intertidal clones tide dynamics to<br>amplify a texture it's like a weave of<br>reading between distant geometry of<br>incomplete time the incomplete<br>expressives a full fold of recursive<br>same difference that seems to move<br>inexorably through and perceptibility<br>through a gradient as a diagram it makes<br>a non representative chamber whose<br>boundary skin is constantly renewed like<br>a tuning wheel it is without density yet<br>forms an energy technology though the<br>human and to title equally engages the<br>notion of material or the flux of<br>thought it occurs in waves and particles<br>it operates on a composite compositional<br>principle resistant to the dissection<br>seal a bit like a like the surging sea<br>heats the urban intertidal is a minimum<br>generic probability graph and it maps<br>the structural pattern of whatever is<br>passing without exacting content the<br>neutral and personal inflection points<br>to the singularity of potentiating and a<br>recursive series under the fourfold of<br>the end completion of time there was no<br>notion of fragmenting there is no is no<br>total as assumed<br>instead it's assumed oscillation so this<br>poor fold is a suspension flood<br>retention and it's an incompletion of<br>time time as a generic materiality<br>without there being essence to time the<br>urban into title it tends to encounter a<br>seeing of free fall thought outside kind<br>of present capital time that can of its<br>own accord<br>begin again for the first time making a<br>sort of tabla rasa of time even flood<br>operated energetic forces of drag and<br>pushed in this recursive series crucial<br>in this regard is the inclusion of<br>suspension and retention and perceptible<br>and mobile points where the<br>vulnerability of common finitude is<br>included at every unseen tune the scope<br>work is inherently focused on the<br>virtuality of space and time and way to<br>the generic to locality the second of<br>these apparatus are the stranger the<br>scope at scope at op orientates towards<br>generic humanity the undivided multiple<br>the very identity of all relation to see<br>with what I named stranger and the<br>context of this research is to see the<br>enable of urban living and dimension for<br>close to will be representational<br>recognition yet to inhabit the seeing<br>practice in urban landscapes an act of<br>cloning is necessary and now just a<br>method to the use of the tide and the<br>enter title here I use the figure of the<br>stranger as a clone of non standard<br>generic humanity<br>it opens seemed that dimension of the<br>priests objective the priests lingual<br>human equality of non humanists without<br>recourse to a philosophic philosophy of<br>being this clone radicalization of the<br>urban subject in the last instant is<br>used as a skopic technology for in<br>counting the lived without figure or<br>figuration is inscribed representation<br>an affords ways into a territory that<br>includes the human it is beyond its<br>discrete bounds there's been a resort<br>sorry to interrupt you are your slides<br>stuck no no definitely not thank you<br>thank you sorry go ahead then<br>it will become I think obviously the NY<br>it wisely so we were they it affords<br>ways into its territory that include the<br>human it is beyond its discrete grounds<br>this method resists the prevailing and<br>normalizing dyad with an urban discourse<br>of stranger and citizen and gives effect<br>to unilateral encounter with the real as<br>the left it's the only basis for<br>identity theft of food scene based on<br>species gender ethnicity and so on and<br>thus sees without division without<br>categorization the cloning of an effect<br>of the real gives space to the stranger<br>as subject in the last instance<br>inhabiting a radically radical solitary<br>and fundamentally vulnerable real to<br>complicate the Urban's prevailing<br>categories of individuation forms to see<br>with the stranger is not thereby to<br>attempt to represent it but allows its<br>notations to afford a host of<br>alternative posthuman images of a living<br>sitting the scope it works through<br>bleating it remains strange when the<br>human is free of the meaningful not to<br>become meaningless but to become<br>singular and non identical now as much I<br>could say about how these scope it's<br>moved my experience of encountering<br>urban landscapes and along with Hill non<br>landscape offer one such possible route<br>to reinvent the means of what it is to<br>imagine new relational shapes of seeing<br>here instead instead I will conclude<br>with a piece of field poetics and look<br>forward to taking some questions just

hollow<br>land with no view to ask what does<br>thought have to become so I'm going to<br>end my presentation there and I hope to<br>take some questions and still you went a<br>little on some of the background of some<br>of those sky picks so please Thank You<br>handy very much for dead and for sure it<br>took us to a different type of landscape<br>I'm very happy now to open to anyone can<br>see is willing to pose a question to<br>Hannah do not forget to n mute yourself<br>raagh I Hana it's fun if you know can<br>you hear me<br>right yeah yeah I love the poem or part<br>I mean I wonder in a wonder what the<br>part of me that loves the poem love's<br>about the poem and that makes me ask you<br>a question about the mediation that you<br>find the image involved in on that kind<br>of constant and power driven way if<br>we're going to critique the image where<br>does that leave us with the word itself<br>a mediating condition so I mean you seem<br>to be using words in a way that you able<br>to get your interests but I don't don't<br>words come with all their practices of<br>whiteness and horror too but what else<br>have we got<br>okay I mean in some regards this<br>particular inquiry could have taken a<br>may not use words and used to<br>diagrammatic or used kind of different<br>form of image making why I've taken up<br>words that the truth of the matter is<br>probably I do find a certain seduction<br>and the medium of poetry and and that<br>might be in contrary to some of the<br>things I'm attempting to come to claim<br>so I can't help but continue to operate<br>and the sort of world I've been educated<br>staying with us it would you know<br>prevailing tools we have to a certain<br>extent but then reframing how they can<br>be used that makes any sense yeah I'm<br>not going to just leave it there but the<br>interesting thing for me about the<br>contrast between word and image<br>is that the word usually has some origin<br>in a particular linguistic culture and<br>so we have this thing we call<br>translation and I'm not sure how there<br>operates in the image so I'm not going<br>to go on go on a better better I think I<br>understand your question but better now<br>and and and exactly this project tries<br>to do is to cap it the form of a stream<br>translation offered its needs and rather<br>than use them the next most or default<br>you know ways of knowing to reach into<br>these these forms of I'm calling I'm<br>scoping apparatus to use those as is<br>proxy so idea is that there's a form of<br>translation taking place of course but<br>it shows itself in a very different way<br>okay<br>so we're always working with proxy yeah<br>cool cloning are cool thank you I think<br>our next question is from Becky kibble I<br>won't to my camera on cuz I'm still in<br>my pajamas<br>yeah just thank you for that that was<br>really really interesting I guess just<br>to follow on from rods question I wonder<br>in fact a bit by you not changing the<br>slide for a long time actually and if if<br>you'd thought about not writing things<br>down because you know there's that kind<br>of is sort of words in terms of kind of<br>verbal or oral communication methods and<br>in these words in terms of stuff that is<br>written on the page and you know just<br>thinking thinking about Marty traditions<br>and how you know knowledge meaning was<br>conveyed orally I don't know just you<br>not actually I mean I guess the medium<br>of this kind of poetics I don't even<br>like poetry but the sort of word that I<br>use in the creative practice is meant to<br>be a spoken word and and I can I guess<br>and I hope this doesn't appear to be a<br>cop-out but it the that's work was<br>developed and you know as an academic in<br>an academic environment and it's not to<br>say I couldn't have engaged in some<br>other speaking practices of course but<br>it gives me something to think about it<br>actually yeah in a way I guess what<br>you're saying is I'm stand still<br>maintaining a kind of tradition one that<br>I'm actually trying to resist so these<br>are possibly a contradiction there you<br>know that it's interesting there's a<br>there's a First Nations Acton and Canada<br>who who kind of subverts writing in<br>another way by whenever he writes he<br>doesn't use use kind of traditional<br>punctuation and English so he'd be using<br>no capital letters and use of full stops<br>or anything like that so there may also<br>be other ways of kind of reframing the<br>written word as well potentially today<br>is not like any other and fixed as they<br>emerge they're all different so it's not<br>like I've got any sort of conventions or<br>rules around how the word is supposed to<br>be elaborated in fact I speak about it<br>as words without language so without the<br>formality of what we perceive is to be<br>comprehensible language around it and<br>the words and moves through the air<br>encounters and engagements through these<br>kopecks and in sort of real places so<br>that's that's the kind of backgrounds of<br>it this particular project<br>thank you thank you I think I have a<br>question for you and how how much does<br>these have inform your thinking in your<br>prezis<br>and the landscape architects that's a<br>really good one this has been my enquiry<br>in this<br>quite difficult space has been going on<br>quite while and in the first instance<br>it's actually stopped me designing so<br>one reason why I withdrew from active<br>design practice is because I thought I<br>was participating and occurrences that I<br>would have rather rather not and they<br>said absolutely no criticism of it of<br>anyone at all but I was wanting to kind<br>of find new ways of framing things so it<br>has shifted my practice quite<br>dramatically and it's a continuum and I<br>find it quite difficult to answer that<br>directly but and then or in a more<br>specific way it's made me see the<br>landscape really differently most<br>definitely and and it focused my<br>attention on things that perhaps are<br>just passing so on time a lot more and<br>in this needing to kind of formalize and<br>put things in and categorizations and so<br>on it's it's enabled me to kind of see<br>the complexity in new ways thank you for<br>that any other questions from our<br>thanks Bruno hi Hannah thank you that<br>was fascinating I'm imagining that<br>because I don't really have an academic<br>brain quite a bit of that needs to be<br>digested by me a bit more thoroughly<br>before I can fully understand everything<br>that was being said but I do think that<br>we need a new way of thinking about<br>landscape and not not just in New<br>Zealand but globally in terms of how<br>would he appreciate it and bring it back<br>to my own experience as a landscape<br>architect here in Wellington we're faced<br>with a resource consent process that or<br>RNA framework that puts a lot of value<br>in the image in the scene of landscape<br>and how other things might sit within it<br>or upon it and I think coming at it from<br>a different direction is something that<br>could be really useful to us as<br>practicing landscape architects to not<br>be so mesmerized by the image and what<br>that image might contain I think we have<br>to go deeper than that and your work the<br>I'm gonna call it a poem I don't know<br>that it's appropriate but that starts to<br>help us I think delve deeper beyond this<br>theme and to understand the processes<br>that are involved so thank you thanks<br>Nicole<br>um I I mean it there's a sort of<br>relations also to what Bruno asked I<br>have been thinking quite a bit about<br>landscape extent assessment practices<br>recently in Epping just reading a bunch<br>of them and I'm finding I've got a kind<br>of excite renewed sense of critical<br>faculty around you know some of the<br>conventions that are employed there and<br>how they do appear to be quite out of<br>step with I think how maybe designers<br>are kind of taking up the landscape so I<br>mean X related to a whole lot of<br>conventions around RMA and so on but I<br>think there is some work to be done<br>there that possibly that's what abuse<br>things I've been thinking about might be<br>able to to kind of you know assistant<br>you know or at least hear some opinions<br>on yeah I think thanks Nicole<br>I think beyond everything else I know<br>that I'll be thinking about this for<br>some time so am i right in thinking this<br>is recorded and we can dip in and out of<br>this more quenon as we choose you are<br>absolutely correct okay final question<br>Peter you raise your hands a mute<br>yourself sorry I'm still getting used to<br>zoom yes hi Hannah and ever else nice to<br>see a few people haven't seen for a<br>while I'm so with some I must say I know<br>I think I need to look at a text version<br>of what you're saying<br>and would really listen to the video but<br>I've got the feeling that and tell me if<br>I'm wrong but just your idea image<br>always is it always something that<br>mediates I'm not really claiming that<br>I've got a particular idea of image I'm<br>just experimenting with some things so<br>it's not like I'm coming out here and<br>you know come up with this working in<br>forming a kind of conclusive body or<br>opinion I've basically home to sort of<br>new way of formulating thought and then<br>taking that and to into a writing<br>practice to to consider new ways of seen<br>and they always like what I do think you<br>know mediation and translation is as we<br>see it before there is always something<br>at play yeah I guess there's also<br>something kind of powerful about in the<br>idea of an image not being like a<br>cultural frame or something or some sort<br>of filter but something that's a<br>reaction<br>and so an image is also something that<br>hits you and that you're joined to and<br>has consequences and things I mean I<br>certainly agree with Nicole and you<br>about the issues of new needing new ways<br>of looking at landscape and issues of<br>power and things like that and but<br>there's yeah I'm so just curious because<br>I'm you know always interested in the<br>power of representation or the power of<br>action or thought or whatever and if<br>yeah it's a it's sort of how to not have<br>you know had to not just say things as a<br>mediated thing so I'm curious as what to<br>what your thoughts were about that and<br>quite happy to keep talking with you<br>about it at some stage yes or it's like<br>for me in this work that the the<br>internal image versus the external image<br>has no boundary and that image forms a<br>shape and that shape actually is also<br>thought so in a way I am exchanging<br>bought an image in a way that is<br>probably quite unconventional<br>I mean it's sense like you're yeah I<br>mean you're exploring words and other<br>things and so they're trying to connect<br>in some way beyond the cliches I suppose<br>yeah so yeah I mean I and I feel<br>sympathy for what you're doing so but<br>yeah we could discuss a bit of you know<br>had non mediating sort of ways of<br>engaging which I think we always we are<br>actually always doing in the landscape<br>for whatever ending in designing and I<br>think designing that's one of the<br>challenges of landscape because<br>landscape is so prone to being sucked<br>into and the imaging you know there's<br>sort of a disconnection from that sort<br>of thing the disconnection from images<br>which are actually not mediating and<br>there is many people asking in the chat<br>box where they can read your work or<br>find your work well<br>to get myself organized and put it on<br>I will update my my webpage on the V eww<br>yeah what I can do is I can send you the<br>mailing list of people that registered<br>for this talk and you can always send<br>them and so on you know something to<br>read okay thank you everyone for<br>attaining this early breakfast talk and<br>I think it's quite successful and just a<br>reminder that in two weeks from now<br>we're gonna continue and there is Tim<br>Waterman associate professor from<br>Bartlett School of Architecture in<br>London and Thank You Hannah and thank<br>you everyone for joining us from<br>literally across the globe I'm seeing<br>names here or people I know from<br>Argentina to Africa to you know Europe<br>like it's just amazing to see how<br>everyone is connected and yeah thank you<br>everyone for coming thank you so much<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
