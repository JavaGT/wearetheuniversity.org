style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you um so in terms of the dominant<br>trends ends identified three key areas<br>here so he's identified visiting friends<br>and relatives and that'll be the the<br>last segment of today's webinar that is<br>my research focus as people may know<br>we're here identified that in times like<br>over nineteen friends and family become<br>more at the center of people's thinking<br>it becomes more important and those<br>connections become quite central for<br>people and that's been identified in<br>other times such as economic recessions<br>that we've identified that that this is<br>a key area and also identified that<br>people start to search for slower things<br>so as life changes people start<br>searching for enjoyment out of simple<br>things where life has slowed down for a<br>lot of people and so they actually take<br>time and search for more information has<br>start to explore more things in the<br>their locality and they start to do more<br>nature based things those things become<br>quite important those regional sort of<br>experiences and also identified the<br>focus on the boardroom and from that<br>what he has seen is um<br>that governance comes under the<br>spotlight so those of you working in<br>institutions may have recognized that in<br>your own setting that when when things<br>start to actually slow us down we start<br>to look more carefully at governance<br>structures governance within our own<br>organization comes under scrutiny as<br>well as governance in other<br>organizations so that comes much more<br>under the spotlight when when things<br>start slowing down when people start<br>actually looking at the values as well<br>and that matters more to people next<br>so in terms of things that Anne has<br>identified as advancing our staycations<br>and given that everyone is sort of in in<br>lockdown that sort of a natural<br>staycation but people are actually as<br>lockdown starts to change and people<br>start looking beyond the lockdown phase<br>people are starting to see things in<br>their own backyard<br>and that they could actually enjoy some<br>of those things without actually going<br>to a destination and staying in<br>commercial accommodation elsewhere<br>there's actually that discover your own<br>backyard kind of mentality and people<br>start to think about enjoying things<br>such as could be photography and<br>appreciating the things and actually<br>engaging in touristic activities but by<br>staying in their own house so those<br>things start becoming a focus the other<br>thing that has been identified is that<br>in times like overnight and other sort<br>of recessionary conditions people's<br>consumer behavior changes so the idea of<br>impulse buying is almost eradicated<br>people start to pause and plan and they<br>take much more responsibility for<br>budgets and there's a lot more care<br>being taken and the the third item that<br>was identified is the end of adventure<br>and by that what Anne's talking about is<br>that there's so much data that tracks so<br>many things if you start searching for<br>things you would have already noticed<br>that you know things that you're<br>searching for in the internet suddenly<br>it's coming up in your Facebook feed and<br>that type of thing and so he calls at<br>the end of the adventure because in<br>other words that information is starting<br>to come to you and through that the<br>advantage is that recommendations can be<br>more tailored specific to what you're<br>looking for and might actually help you<br>with your planning we're now up to the<br>Thank You ELISA and I continue more<br>about the slowed in the arista tree<br>but of course also about the<br>opportunities and that really taps into<br>what Alisa already said and we really<br>trying to do to honor<br>Ian's work here who does a lot of<br>scenario planning and that's where it<br>actually comes from the big one is<br>really extreme experience seeking now<br>anyone be it families anyone else still<br>wants to accumulate experiences but it<br>will look differently it will look more<br>for slower trends it will be more<br>thrifty trends it will be more local<br>trends as well so relatively cheap and<br>connect people to nature in more holes<br>on thrift instead of the exotic<br>experiences such as really expensive<br>frivolous risky or environmentally<br>destructive will be much more frowned<br>upon as well we all spend quite a lot of<br>time on social media as well and it used<br>to be a real appeal to you know show off<br>some of these extreme extreme<br>experiences but that's all changed in a<br>recession in a covert nineteen<br>environment as well we know that a lot<br>of families I actually struggling and<br>hurting and this is not the time to show<br>off so conspicuous consumption is now<br>much more out of favor in simplicity in<br>slower more nature in more thrifty<br>experiences dominate but of course<br>there's the whole opportunity about<br>simplicity in truth the other one is to<br>decline of deference we live in a world<br>of fake news I'm sure we're all familiar<br>us that fun and public respect and Trust<br>for institution experience and<br>government has declined there's an entry<br>of skepticism about the quality of<br>information provided by anyone who<br>assists I'm an expert economics<br>economists academics and others but<br>again that's in an economic recession<br>there's also in real opportunity that we<br>actually seek leadership that we<br>actually do see experts in their field<br>in authority and I think some of this we<br>can actually already see next slide<br>please<br>the other slow trends is our cream<br>consumerism<br>yes it's become a lot more mainstream if<br>we do want to have you know more<br>sustainable living but not at a high<br>price we know from research and<br>the past a lot of people who actually go<br>to high-end luxury resorts ecotourism<br>resorts do this again as part of the<br>image what I sort of talked about<br>earlier is part of the extreme<br>experiences but I actually know much<br>more price sensitive so when it actually<br>comes to price and there's an extra<br>premium for a lot of these sustainable<br>or Korean consumer items that's much<br>more slow to people will be much more<br>cautious cautious about spending all<br>that money and the opportunity of course<br>is then more the basics<br>the other one is materialism and again<br>as hopefully you can see all of these<br>things tie in was what we've been<br>talking about before it's less about<br>materialism because we've learned I<br>think we've all been in lockdown for the<br>last few weeks we actually realized well<br>maybe we actually don't have to spend so<br>much money maybe we don't actually need<br>to accumulate so much so it really is<br>about social change and human<br>development and that's during a<br>recession as well behaviors really<br>change and it's a move away from<br>individualism to much more thinking<br>about others it's about collectivism in<br>again that some of the things we're<br>seeing people are much more where we're<br>they're spin their money it's a lot more<br>about local businesses in a much more of<br>a concern for consumption . so there's<br>their real opportunity for volunteering<br>in social tourism something i will talk<br>about later on as well next slide please<br>so that's the work from ian Yeomans and<br>i now want to talk about really about<br>the opportunities for family and social<br>tourism in new zealand now my background<br>I did my PhD on domestic tourism which<br>is now just about 10 years ago<br>but since then have actually done a lot<br>of research not just in New Zealand but<br>other research as well on family tourism<br>so for me it's actually a real<br>opportunity to showcase in advocate war<br>for thinking of families in a domestic<br>what we actually seeing now domestic<br>tourism you know in that sense wanna<br>include Australia as well and of course<br>ELISA is in Australia we're talking<br>about the trends Testament bubble and of<br>course we have a lot of relationships in<br>at least I will talk more about to be if<br>visiting friends and relatives a lot of<br>travel between Australia in New Zealand<br>as visiting friends and families and is<br>a lot of family tourism as well so many<br>ways it's an extended Oceania bubble as<br>well as an opportunity next slide please<br>so as an opportunity estimated family<br>tourism is estimated to be worth about<br>seven to twelve billion and it<br>represents a large and growing market<br>for domestic tourism now for anyone who<br>isn't aware of that but domestic tourism<br>is actually bigger than international<br>tourism it makes about 57 percent the<br>issue really is that most international<br>tourism in a lot of focus of course<br>because this is export earning is really<br>predominantly focused on individuals or<br>couples in not so much on families which<br>is why a lot of businesses that<br>primarily have catered for the<br>international market might actually have<br>to realign some of these things and<br>that's what I actually like to advocate<br>as well because I really think there's a<br>real opportunity for any of us for<br>families traveling in New Zealand but of<br>course any tourism businesses and you<br>see land in Australia as well to tap<br>better into the family market as well<br>family holidays are primarily about<br>reconnecting it's all about connecting<br>getting in touch with each other<br>increased communication creating fun<br>memories children want to have fun I had<br>one eight year old boat say that if it's<br>if it's fun it's a holiday if it's not<br>fun it's not a holiday so fun very much<br>comes into it but then it also actually<br>means children want to be entertained<br>all the time and one I actually have<br>these fun experiences<br>it's about memory creation the photo<br>opportunities so taking photos is very<br>much part of that family story and it's<br>also a real opportunity to leave a<br>legacy and that's something very<br>important we have to remember because<br>for a lot off you see that families and<br>that's probably the same for Australian<br>families as well it's handling their own<br>values as well but it's also values<br>about who you are belonging in a family<br>also the sinner nations are for example<br>in New Zealand a lot of families and<br>deaths from my research as well actually<br>said well we really want to show our<br>family New Zealand and appreciate it and<br>it goes back to that 80s campaign don't<br>leave home until you've seen the country<br>so it's a real showcasing of you know be<br>proud of who we are more local<br>experiences as well and that's your<br>domestic holidays are part of that whole<br>who we are the Kiwi identity creation<br>and then of course this would be similar<br>in Australia as well<br>families predominantly drive in their<br>own car it's the easiest but also<br>families actually have a lot of gear and<br>that just makes it a lot easier so it's<br>predominantly self drive rather<br>necessary flying and that's of course<br>won't be probably going to see when we<br>move into the next alert level two more<br>self-driving travel as well next slide<br>please<br>some of the key trends associated as<br>family tourism so I really want to<br>stress this that yes that dominant<br>family crib is probably still the<br>nuclear family there's two parents and<br>two children but that's of course<br>increasingly increasingly changing and<br>we need to really think about that much<br>more and I will get to that later on as<br>well when it comes to pricing so it has<br>a lot more families that be blended and<br>reconstituted so they're smaller<br>families but also these bigger families<br>more non-traditional families single<br>parent families one parent in you know<br>several children and then we shouldn't<br>really forget and that's really<br>important as well we have more immigrant<br>families now a lot of immigrant families<br>don't actually have their own family<br>here but then they're quite often make<br>friends their own family as well and I<br>think that's something important what at<br>least I will talk about as well the<br>visiting friends and families and even<br>though you might not have family here<br>friends actually become your new family<br>as well the other thing that's really<br>important when we talk about immigrant<br>families many of them have not<br>necessarily seen the country or<br>travelled around the country so there's<br>a real opportunity as well<br>so the face of what families look like<br>today<br>this changing rabidly the other big<br>trend the scran travel crane travel is<br>friend parents and grandchildren travel<br>in multi-generational travel we have to<br>remember that in the last few weeks<br>during lockdown most families probably<br>hadn't almost crenshaw and haven't<br>really seen their grandparents and those<br>can't grandparents really wanna spend<br>some time with their grandchildren in<br>cran travel could include day trips as<br>well we've recently done some research<br>on that and we really found it's a very<br>very special relationship that cran<br>children have missed their grandparents<br>and vice versa it's usually less tension<br>it's a lot more fun there's a lot of<br>humor involved and it's a lot about<br>handing down values in legacies as well<br>so again that's actually really<br>important when we talk about these<br>things because a lot of grandparents are<br>probably really happy to show their<br>grandchildren places around New Zealand<br>in Australia as well a point further<br>down grandfathers become much more<br>involved as well and fathers so from our<br>research quite a few crane father said<br>well you know as when I was a father I<br>was really really busy and I really<br>relish the opportunity as a grandfather<br>now I have more time to actually show my<br>grandchildren to teach them things teach<br>them skills how to be water save take<br>them fishing take them to places and<br>again for the current mothers as well<br>take them to museum so it could be day<br>trip but you know longer trips as well<br>and that sort of really important to<br>remember as well we've had a situation<br>now where a lot of families which cooped<br>up in their houses and particularly<br>mothers who had to work all of them<br>struggled immensely having to work from<br>home or actually had to leave the home<br>as well and children had to stay at home<br>so a lot of mothers and of course<br>fathers as well seek a break from those<br>care responsibilities and I think this<br>is where extended families will come in<br>as well the other big point is that<br>children are nowadays a lot more<br>involved in decision making we're<br>talking about more democratic families<br>so they have more of a say in what to do<br>and where to go in anyone who wants to<br>target vehicle architecting else really<br>needs to take that into consideration as<br>well and then of course fathers are have<br>become much more actively involved as<br>well I'd want to take them to places as<br>so when we talk about reimagining<br>tourism we know from a new cinema<br>perspective<br>we're talking about responding<br>restarting and now reimagining tourism<br>as well and my agenda here in probably<br>we are hoping to really make a<br>contribution as advocating more taking<br>families into account as part of their<br>reimagining tourism as well<br>TV holidays are very much part of the<br>keenya identity and there's a real<br>opportunity to really market more on<br>that to play more on that because it's<br>all about connecting children to their<br>roots so not just us in the family roots<br>but you know it's part of becoming part<br>of a New Zealand identity Kiwi identity<br>aware as well the big issue really is<br>affordability a lot of families are<br>hurting yes they are families who might<br>have come through the last few weeks<br>unscathed but we do know a lot of<br>families are hurting and you know that<br>really has to be taken into account and<br>there needs to be some more creative<br>pricing the other thing we should really<br>remember kids are part of families as<br>well in those weeks you do have pets<br>don't always leave want to leave their<br>dog at a kennel and I think from a<br>tourism industry industry perspective<br>and holiday accommodation providers if<br>they can become more pet friendly that<br>will go a long way as well because a lot<br>of families don't really want to leave<br>their dog behind but actually be able to<br>bring their dog along as well making<br>tourism overall much more accessible for<br>all families as I sort of mentioned not<br>everyone can afford it we have a lot of<br>struggling families we're not talking<br>about procession maybe even a depression<br>and this is where that whole idea of<br>social tourism comes in tourism social<br>toriel<br>as tourism as an added moral value in<br>mr. primary aim is to benefit not just a<br>host but also to visitors so it could<br>actually really be both sides benefiting<br>any disadvantaged or struggling families<br>but also benefiting any struggling<br>businesses as well which quite often of<br>course are family businesses as well<br>next slide please<br>so as part of a covert 19 recovery<br>strategy strategy I think what we really<br>have to think very hard if we want to<br>cater better in target more towards<br>families in a domestic environment and<br>hopefully also long-term as well is<br>family-friendly pricing and incentives<br>so getting away from that idea I'm only<br>having a family price for two parents<br>and two children but be actually more<br>creative as well<br>another thing that's also I know in New<br>Zealand it's usually children have to<br>pay full price when they're 2 and 14<br>anyone who's got teenagers actually know<br>that that period of 14 to 17 is actually<br>really really expensive they eat you out<br>of the house and so maybe we actually<br>need to think more creatively there as<br>well I know that for the great Hawks<br>Department of Conservation all children<br>under 18 actually free and that's a real<br>incentive to get families walking on<br>those great walks and maybe that's sort<br>of one way of thinking as well other<br>things I like to sort of float are<br>mainly family discounts cards vouchers<br>for struggling families and maybe other<br>social tourism initiatives and that of<br>course could become part of a government<br>package as well so at least I like to<br>float that idea that this could become<br>part of a government initiative not just<br>in many ways providing benefits benefits<br>for the for the tourism businesses but<br>also allowing a lot of struggling local<br>families to engage with the tourism<br>industry and go to attractions at a<br>reduced or maybe even at a free private<br>price so that's really something we need<br>to consider the other one as I sort of<br>mentioned children have a lot more say<br>today so anyone marketing to the<br>domestic market really has to take it to<br>a<br>that there are high tech savvy children<br>they want to be enticed by it as well so<br>it really needs a creative marketing the<br>other really big issue we have a school<br>hallways and I know an economist floated<br>the idea of actually staggering the<br>school holidays which is actually a<br>really good idea but might not be<br>practical we have these issues yes if<br>you want to entice families they only<br>have a two week holiday break when it<br>comes to ski tourism and of course<br>that's what we happened last year we had<br>really really long fuse and we can't<br>really have that under any alert level<br>we can't have beacuse maybe another idea<br>is allowing families to take their<br>children out of school for one week so I<br>think we really need to talk as a nation<br>about more flexibility if we actually<br>want to entice the families they have to<br>be able to travel as well but not the<br>whole of New Zealand at the same time<br>necessarily health and safety has always<br>been paramount for any families and that<br>really has to be taken into account<br>professional cleaning social distancing<br>really has to be taking into account the<br>really nice thing I've been seeing I<br>live in Devonport I saw so many families<br>out on their bikes it's been a real real<br>pleasure and that whole more active<br>families I think provides a real<br>potential for our cycle trails could be<br>tramping could be skiing could be other<br>things as well<br>in here's just to reiterate it's a<br>really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity<br>for a lot of for me families those who<br>can't afford it and for others we<br>actually really have to make it more<br>affordable to see their country but also<br>to support local businesses and just to<br>sort of leave on one last message from<br>me before I hand it over to Alisa we<br>should consider families aren't not just<br>this somewhere else but also try and<br>entice families in our neighborhood for<br>any tourism businesses so think local as<br>well as national as a first spot and I<br>thank you very much so just in case<br>there was a bit of confusion with the<br>slide here that's there so my personal<br>name that I go under is Elise's Enfield<br>but all my publications are under ELISA<br>Becker just in case people confused by<br>the two names um if I could have the<br>so wonder start out by talking about<br>life post covert 19 so I'm not sure what<br>countries the the participants are from<br>I know we've got about 300 participants<br>here with us at the moment and no doubt<br>from all different countries and so<br>we're at different stages people are<br>experiencing different levels of of<br>lockdown but then going beyond that what<br>happens when organizations and<br>destination marketing organizations want<br>to say look we're open for business<br>how'd he get the timing right now there<br>was a piece of research that Brent<br>Richie from University of Queensland and<br>I did I've got the reference down there<br>for people interested in that that was<br>in International Journal of tourism<br>research and we actually looked at VFR<br>travel as being a suitable market when<br>organizations start saying hey we're<br>open for business and trying to get that<br>balance right and it is really really<br>important because what we're seeing with<br>and it might have been a natural<br>disaster or something where there's<br>pressure for demos to get started and if<br>the timings wrong it doesn't go down<br>well the community's not happy and<br>people feel it's inappropriate so<br>getting that balance right is incredibly<br>crucial one of the things that Brent and<br>I looked at is whether VFR travel should<br>be considered as one of those early<br>markets to move and we did see that it<br>was a suitable market segment for<br>destinations recovering from various<br>different things if I could have the<br>not only do we have to consider the<br>readiness for people to want to move to<br>other destinations and experience<br>touristic activities but also<br>communities receiving people so if we<br>think there's a range of different<br>destinations all in different stages<br>different stages of lockdown different<br>levels of nervousness we've got some<br>places that have a lot of active cases<br>and a lot of transmission still and then<br>there are some communities that don't<br>have haven't had any active transmission<br>for maybe five weeks so destinations are<br>at different stages and you can<br>understand that communities may feel<br>nervous about the idea of receiving<br>people once we see locked-down changing<br>and whether they feel at risk of you<br>know more transmission so we we have to<br>think about how that's managed one of<br>the things that is the case with VFR<br>travelers is that the perception of them<br>is different in their community because<br>people are connected to the community<br>they're either a friend or a family then<br>there does tend to be more embracing and<br>acceptance of those people so that that<br>can just be something to consider in<br>terms of appropriate timing the thing<br>that Brent and I looked at and people<br>may be familiar with Weaver and Lawtons<br>work on market segmentation testing we<br>actually went through the eight market<br>segmentation test for VFR travel and<br>found that it passed all of those<br>criteria so therefore we determined that<br>it was an appropriate market segment to<br>also don't want to leave with a point of<br>of life in covert 19 I think to look<br>beyond it we have to recognize what it<br>is and some people are doing better than<br>others but there are a lot of different<br>emotions amongst people so<br>the picture at the top right-hand side<br>is is sort of an interesting one that's<br>actually taken in the state of New South<br>Wales in Australia because technically<br>what those people are doing as innocent<br>as it is is actually against the law and<br>potentially a $1,600 Australian dollar<br>fine because that's really a social<br>gathering outside of the house so that's<br>allowed so those types of things<br>an innocent you know sitting down on<br>grass and the innocent activity can<br>attract fines and and and that's very<br>uncomfortable for people there's also<br>the concept of sensory deprivation<br>because you know people are experiencing<br>you know social monotony<br>isolation lack of connection and that<br>sort of makes people feel uncomfortable<br>some people are suffering high levels of<br>anxiety depression there's a lot of<br>people citing inability to sleep there's<br>a lot of uncertainty nobody knows when<br>it'll be over and so that makes planning<br>hard and then low morale so on the flip<br>side of that planning a holiday without<br>handing over money and getting to that<br>level of data can actually raise morale<br>it gives you something positive to look<br>forward to it gives you something to<br>think about people miss friends and<br>family and the idea of looking at oh<br>where could we connect next and who<br>visits who and and those types of things<br>can be really helpful for people people<br>are definitely feeling the need to<br>reconnect now some interesting research<br>that came out of University of<br>Queensland from Gabby Walters recently<br>actually highlighted and this is<br>Australian centric so I do apologize for<br>that that more than half of the people<br>that were surveyed did state that they<br>were looking to a planned holiday it was<br>some domestic it was in Australia and<br>and the things that came up is that they<br>weren't keen to go to a city they were<br>looking at regional locations<br>door and there was a reticence about the<br>idea of flying people were looking for<br>drive experiences and you can sort of<br>understand that because people are more<br>aware of Hygiene and the idea of being<br>in close proximity in an aeroplane and<br>feeling trapped is is more likely to be<br>a negative indicator so those drive<br>tourism experiences and and now more at<br>the forefront for people I'm could I<br>have the next slide please<br>so on the subject of hygiene certainly<br>it's come up that people are more aware<br>and conscious of Hygiene and ago one of<br>the attributes of visiting friends and<br>relatives is that for people that feel<br>that that's quite central there is a<br>little bit more control over your<br>environment if you're connecting with<br>friends and relatives particularly if<br>you're staying with those people then<br>you might feel more comfortable and in<br>control of those types of matters people<br>who are nervous about it may feel less<br>in control of hygiene matters in<br>commercial accommodation and those types<br>of things so so it does sort of resonate<br>a key point there the other thing is<br>that people because they've been in<br>lockdown they've kind of reconnected<br>their own thinking about the value of<br>friends and family there's a bit of loss<br>rgi I had the opportunity to catch up<br>with my mom or my friend I didn't take<br>that opportunity when I could have and<br>now I wish I had of and I can't wait to<br>reconnect again and there's people who<br>have missed opportunities a grand<br>child's first birthday or Mother's you<br>know seven years birthday and those sort<br>of things graduations you know cancelled<br>as a point of celebration and connection<br>so those things are making people<br>consider the importance of friends and<br>family and appreciate that long for that<br>more and as indicated at the beginning<br>of my presentation VFR travel has been<br>identified through previous research as<br>an appropriate early market to target<br>after crises because people can stir<br>thinking about life after covered 19 but<br>it's which markets to move first<br>that is the point to consider next slide<br>please<br>and just as my final point to mention<br>that the thing about the if I travel is<br>they do spend money and local economies<br>and people sometimes forget about that<br>they also are a larger travel party<br>because you've got the people coming<br>into the region as well as a host travel<br>party so you're looking at a substantial<br>travel party there and it's also a wide<br>demographic it's also a wider<br>socio-economic groups that's very<br>inclusive and a key point is that it's<br>also suitable for older single travelers<br>so if you think about an elderly person<br>maybe they're a solitary survivor the<br>idea of travel even in normal times is<br>uncomfortable and frightening for them<br>but VFR travel actually engages for them<br>because they're going to see friends and<br>relatives and so it motivates them to<br>connect and they feel comfortable with<br>that as opposed to going on their own<br>leisure holidays so it is a an important<br>segment that is very inclusive and<br>previous research has also shown that it<br>actually improves quality of life and<br>certainly at the moment we have a strong<br>focus on quality of life so it's<br>particularly important so that's the end<br>of my presentation I'll now hand over to<br>our chair poor Whitelaw to capture<br>questions terrific thank you very much<br>ELISA and also thank you to likely for<br>your presentation enter in in absentia I<br>was listening to the presentations but I<br>got a news flash that jumped up on my<br>screen I'm not sure if anybody is aware<br>but the australian cabinet met this<br>morning and and they have announced the<br>series of initiatives in true australian<br>fashion we've nicked some of it from New<br>Zealand so the 3s model where patrons<br>need to be seated separated<br>separate servers so there's no counter<br>service and the Australian model is is<br>what they're calling the factor ten<br>model so at first blush bars and<br>restaurants will be open with a maximum<br>of ten patrons at any one time provided<br>they're seated separated and have<br>individual service and then after four<br>weeks they'll roll that to a hundred<br>people and then another four weeks to a<br>thousand people and then beyond that so<br>you your timing for this discussion is<br>is quite precent now we have a number of<br>questions that have come in what I'll do<br>now is throw to our colleague Colette<br>who has been tracking those questions<br>and I think we've got about four or five<br>questions collet yes that's correct<br>we've got one question here from Suzanne<br>beacon and I believe this is for high<br>card this one's for you<br>she asks do we have any evidence if a<br>family holiday taken in New Zealand ie<br>the great Kiwi summer holiday differs<br>from a trip for taken overseas for<br>example do people have different<br>motivations treble styles or spending<br>patterns etc and she adds if they do do<br>expect that they transfer these from<br>overseas trips that can't be done now to<br>New Zealand's so a few questions and<br>therefore you hiker okay thank you and<br>thank you so so no yeah that's a lot of<br>question I'm not sure I can answer all<br>of it I'm not sure about the spending so<br>but yes there is there are definitely<br>different motivations from my research<br>the domestic you know the kini family<br>holiday it's very much about handing<br>down that tradition of the Kiwi family<br>holiday as well and I think that's<br>something we can actually really Tappin<br>at the moment and there will be families<br>who usually actually go in winter to<br>some exotic resort island or Bali and<br>actually haven't been to any winter<br>winter holiday in New Zealand and I<br>think there's an opportunity in maybe<br>they might transfer debt spending<br>pattern I'm here in Auckland and I know<br>in Auckland air a lot of families and a<br>lot of children haven't actually<br>in the snow which of course would be<br>hard for both of us the Sun is from<br>southern Germany as I am as well so we<br>corrupt the snow so I think there's an<br>opportunity but in terms of coming back<br>to your question yes ago going overseas<br>the fundamentals are still the same<br>about a family holiday it's about<br>reconnecting having fun the memories the<br>photos and all of that but there is<br>still a different motivation and from my<br>research as well I had quite a few<br>families work she said it would like to<br>take their children overseas and expose<br>them to a different culture and that's<br>their cultural you know element<br>sometimes into more developing countries<br>as well like Vietnam and so on and<br>system anyways actually showed them that<br>sort of social consciousness as well<br>maybe showed him how lucky they are<br>and of course traveling in New Zealand<br>is different in that sense because it's<br>maybe showing them how lucky they are<br>that they actually live in New Zealand<br>so that is a different motivation behind<br>that and I hope I sort of answered that<br>question but in terms of spending I<br>can't really comment on that because my<br>research just looks really more at the<br>sociology and the qualitative elements<br>of traveling but I suspect that those<br>families who can who haven't who've come<br>through October 19 situation and still<br>have some money in their budget might<br>see it as an opportunity opportunity -<br>yeah for example having a winter holiday<br>which they might have never had with<br>their children and hopefully then<br>actually spent money in the local<br>economy<br>thank you that certainly was getting<br>several questions in for the price of<br>one nice would ik call it next one<br>please<br>fantastic this one here is directed for<br>ELISA this is from Randy Alan Pei and he<br>asks what a fig do you see the quote<br>decline of deference having on consumers<br>going to travel agents and other<br>intermediate and intermediaries sorry<br>related to this how will covert 19<br>experience change the tourist trip<br>excellent question thank you the answer<br>is not much at all because VFR travelers<br>are not really very responsive to<br>generic promotional campaigns they rely<br>very heavily on the local resident as<br>the source of knowledge and that's the<br>interesting thing about VFR travel<br>because they believe that the local<br>resident will be the best point of<br>contact and the best point of knowledge<br>that they can trust for where to stay if<br>they're choosing commercial<br>accommodation where to go out the best<br>travel were all those types of things<br>with their planning but of course<br>operators market outside of the region<br>so when asked the question where is a<br>good place to say if they're wanting<br>commercial accommodation a local<br>resident won't know because they're<br>clearly not staying there but the VFR<br>will actually look for the local as the<br>best point of care information as<br>opposed to a travel agent or other<br>sources terrific thank you next great<br>we've got two questions here from<br>Christopher Joyce the first one is open<br>to both speakers Christopher asks how do<br>you think the share of commercial<br>accommodation may change will people be<br>wanting to avoid hotels hostels etc and<br>focus on Airbnb rentals where they can<br>have an entire building to themselves so<br>quite specific this one I might start<br>and then hand board to hiker I think<br>it's a really interesting question<br>I think the honest answer is it's hard<br>to know but certainly early research has<br>indicated that people are very aware of<br>Hygiene in a completely new way and<br>certainly as I mentioned before wanting<br>to have avoid aeroplanes and looking at<br>drive tourism that may translate to<br>wanting to be more independent with<br>their accommodation initially until<br>people<br>you know become more accustomed and you<br>know start to gradually feel more<br>relaxed I don't know if you want to add<br>anything to that hiker yeah thank you um<br>you know for some other questions as<br>well when I raced a point versus<br>grandparents traveling in yes absolutely<br>I think self-contained probably because<br>that whole awareness of safety of house<br>and when you're self-contained and there<br>will definitely be an emphasis on<br>professional cleaning in social<br>distancing and that will you know in<br>what we talkin you seen and staying in<br>our bubble and ensuring that bubble I<br>think that well initially but then of<br>course it really depends on how hotels<br>in other shared accommodation providers<br>what what initiatives they taking as<br>well to ensuring you know the safety and<br>the physical that the social distancing<br>as well just to continue on the hiker<br>the second question relates to your<br>answer there which talks about<br>grandparents for example and whether<br>there be potentially any reluctance or<br>whether their behaviors might change<br>given that they are the oldest<br>demographic who are most likely at risk<br>from Co the nineteen if you have any<br>further comments to that point please<br>mmm good question<br>I suspect yes there will be just a<br>really heightened awareness about health<br>and safety in there really apps you know<br>they have to and they probably want to<br>make absolutely sure that is a safe and<br>that's maybe there might be you know a<br>combination was VFR cream grandchildren<br>staying with them in then doing to stay<br>trips to safe places rather than going<br>to places where there lots of other<br>people in yes was I sort of mentioned<br>earlier probably more self-contained in<br>professionally cleaned places just to<br>minimize any risk until we know more I<br>think that will be sort of the immediate<br>future and then we have to see I mean<br>everyone is really cautious in<br>particularly and that's in many ways<br>that has been the government message for<br>the last few weeks that anyone over<br>seventeen he needs to be really really<br>careful so we will have to move out of<br>it slowly and carefully and really<br>reassure that it is safe too<br>do so thank you thanks Ari<br>next one call it great I'm gonna make<br>reference to the first question that was<br>posed by Julia and whether we can answer<br>this or not I put to the speakers<br>because this is based on in yeoman's<br>work who was unable to be with us today<br>she comments that Ian wrote a report on<br>the experiential economy predicted to<br>arise in 2020 of course this year is<br>this now a real opportunity for New<br>Zealand especially with regards to New<br>Zealand owned version of the air BnB<br>like platform offering events<br>accommodation and experiences I doubt<br>whether our speakers and we have<br>intimate details of this report but I<br>yeah thank you I certainly don't feel<br>qualified to answer that question I'm<br>not intimately familiar with Ian's work<br>to the extent where I'd feel confident<br>speaking for him so and and not being<br>based in New Zealand again that's just<br>not in my comfort zone it's a great<br>question I just I'm afraid I can't honor<br>it okay I just jump in here but I<br>completely agree this is work I've done<br>some work on experiences and<br>experiential travel so maybe just from<br>this perspective in probably tying into<br>what Ian's identified at some as some of<br>the growing trends there will be<br>experiences people still want to look<br>for experience as an experiential travel<br>but it will look differently it might be<br>more slow experiences it might be more<br>connecting as our loved ones and that<br>could be friends and family it might be<br>more cycling trails it might be more<br>going back to nature I think most of us<br>in lockdown have really appreciated that<br>it's much quieter there's less traffic<br>on the road it's a slower pace of life<br>and I think the experiences that we've<br>gained through that period period might<br>continue on and more people who want to<br>actually seek that was their loved ones<br>as well but yes we need eared for that<br>one so thank you I thought so Paul if<br>you're happy I'm just gonna go ahead yes<br>please fantastic we've had quite a few<br>questions as we've started the Q&amp;A so<br>I'm just going to be reading somewhat<br>randomly from that we've got one here<br>which asks what kind of tourism do we<br>want to have post covert and which type<br>of tourism we don't want to have so for<br>example asking for a best case in a<br>worst case scenario and do we really<br>want to continue with unethical business<br>models of international company<br>companies such as cruises and Airbnb s<br>I'll open this up to both presenters and<br>this in some way does reference IANS<br>work too with the idea of green<br>consumerism and the idea that and many<br>people are looking in that direction<br>yeah thank you<br>it is a really important question<br>I certainly don't want to talk much on<br>cruise tourism but I think it's fairly<br>obvious to say that that's not going to<br>be one of the first markets moving it<br>has a lot of work to do so I'll leave<br>that there but you know as I mentioned<br>in the beginning of my presentation<br>about VFR certainly it's incredibly<br>important from an individual point of<br>view as well as at a community level to<br>look at what markets are appropriate I<br>think it goes without saying that<br>domestic tourism will be the focus<br>international tourism won't be the<br>initial focus for operators and as that<br>early research has shown people are<br>looking for non city experiences they're<br>looking for coastal they're looking for<br>regional they're looking for country<br>they're looking for drive tourism and<br>they're looking to reconnect<br>so therefore VFR is an appropriate first<br>market there are lots of opportunities<br>for operators to actually actively<br>engage with that market because they do<br>spend money and there's been research in<br>some destinations that show they see<br>they spend the same in some cases more<br>money so it does depend on the<br>destination but yet from an economic<br>perspective it's definitely there and I<br>think and Hika will speak more on her<br>own research but elements like<br>reconnecting and going away as a family<br>make obvious sense as being first and<br>appropriate segments but goal tambul -<br>hi canal okay thank you Lisa you're<br>probably covered quite a bit yeah I<br>think most will say we don't want to go<br>back to what was normal we really look<br>at it and that's where any scene in debt<br>talk about the reimagining reimagining<br>and really think of it differently<br>cruise ships are actually very popular<br>with families but I completely agree and<br>you probably find every academic tourism<br>academic say to say we don't really want<br>to go back to that and it was really<br>interesting to say that as tourism<br>academics we've been highlighting a lot<br>of criticism about cruise ships the big<br>cruise ships and<br>no one really was willing to listen but<br>suddenly people communities are I live<br>in Auckland we affected by this as well<br>and it's really interesting to see which<br>really allows us and that sort of why I<br>felt it's really important to have this<br>webinar in race be if our raise families<br>and also that whole concept of social<br>tourism a lot of families in New Zealand<br>have also felt themselves displaced I<br>live here in Auckland<br>probably most families in Auckland have<br>not been to the South Island of New<br>Zealand it's actually perceived to be<br>cheaper to travel to Australia to the<br>Gold Coast for example so that allows<br>for an opportunity but it's also a bit<br>of a wake up call that may be actually a<br>lot of families in you sit and feel<br>excluded in whether we want to continue<br>actually having a tourism industry that<br>is actually not really catering for its<br>local population as well and that's<br>where maybe social tourism maybe family<br>discount cards be if our travel all of<br>these things really have to be taken<br>more into account as well and maybe less<br>exclusive tourism as well or maybe just<br>for a certain market there's all sorts<br>of ideas being floated I listen to it<br>here a seminar as well and they were<br>talking about a quota system make it<br>primarily domestic and then maybe you<br>know be more selective in who's actually<br>allowing to allow to come to New Zealand<br>or maybe to Australia as well so it's<br>absolutely an opportunity to think and I<br>think it really has to go back to<br>communities we have to ask communities<br>what kind of tourism they're warned as<br>well and as Lisa of course pointed out<br>VFR because that's you know it's like<br>friends friends I buy that and of course<br>we would want to have that that's one of<br>the first form of tourism that any<br>community feels safe and want to<br>encourage and it's very similar with<br>families as well because we are all<br>families but you know what the next<br>steps are a lot more research is needed<br>for that one thank you we probably had<br>the time for a very quick response to<br>one final question and that is just on<br>the applicability of virtual tourism<br>experiences and how both speakers might<br>say that playing a role as we move<br>forward<br>yes thank you I actually sense that<br>people are a little bit tired of using<br>their computer like a lot of people are<br>connecting with their friends and family<br>at the moment through things like zoom<br>and it's it's created quite a bit of<br>zoom fatigue in a sense because if<br>people are working using a screen and of<br>course we've got kids in I don't know<br>how many countries but certainly in<br>Australia we've got cases where the<br>online learning is replaced normal<br>schools so we've got a lot of screen<br>dominance people are connecting with<br>their friends and family as I said with<br>with zoom there's a lot of that and zoom<br>is actually cognitively demanding it's<br>it's actually much more demanding then<br>like having a normal meeting and so<br>people are quite fatigued so the idea of<br>having more of that when life becomes<br>more normal again I'm not sure people be<br>looking for that that's that's my sense<br>of it I'll hand over to hiker for her<br>thoughts you know I completely support<br>VFR in family it's all about<br>reconnecting it's about having a chat<br>together of a glass of wine of a good<br>meal it's about sharing things it's<br>about having a hug it's about having a<br>laughter that's normal it's all these<br>little things sitting together<br>grandchildren sitting with their<br>grandparents in poking fun at each other<br>it's so I think well if we talk about<br>families in VFR virtual room that that's<br>that that boss has been happening for<br>the last few weeks so that's why<br>actually I think yeah as soon as we<br>allowed to travel and go down in eluard<br>levels people would want to react<br>reconnect in person because mutual does<br>what they've been doing the last few</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
