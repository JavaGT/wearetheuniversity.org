public policy<br>who got a slight change of pace today<br>instead of focusing on responses to<br>Corvin we're going very much further<br>beyond that with today's wonderful guest<br>professor Christopher Newman from<br>Northumberland Northumbria University in<br>Newcastle all the way over in the UK<br>morning Christopher hello Michael how<br>you doing very well sir thank you very<br>much for being with us today I really<br>appreciated now just before we gone I'll<br>give a little brief introduction the<br>expression jack of all trades and master<br>of none is frequently used for a lot of<br>different academics and it couldn't be<br>further from the truth for this<br>gentleman here Christopher<br>is truly a master of all the trades the<br>many trades that he's been involved in<br>over the years<br>Christopher is originally a former<br>police officer former member of Special<br>Branch former Andy terrorism and<br>counterterrorism expert in the British<br>intelligence services a farmer<br>practicing solicitor and now a very<br>successful professor at North Ruby<br>University but also most importantly it<br>was he is Britain if not Europe's<br>leading expert in space law<br>thanks for coming Chris I know you're a<br>very busy man I hope I was treating you<br>well now a little looking to be with you<br>thank you know we want to talk to there<br>just a little bit about space policy and<br>space line I know this may seem a little<br>bit out of the ordinary for a few people<br>so if I could just ask you Chris<br>generally speaking does New Zealand have<br>an interesting space law one of the<br>reasons I'm so glad to be talking to you<br>right now is that New Zealand is one of<br>the leading countries in developing<br>space policy and developing its space<br>activity there are a group of<br>like-minded countries the UK one<br>Australia's another New Zealand is a<br>third and they're all developing that<br>there in what I call a second wave of<br>space activity very much looking to<br>develop independent launch capacity and<br>become a center of small space activity<br>but I use small space in the term of<br>small satellites so the really are right<br>at the cutting edge of technology<br>actually in many ways New Zealand are<br>leading the way in this you know you<br>keep got a rich tradition of<br>manufacturing small satellites but<br>actually New Zealand's beating them to<br>the punch with the 2017 high altitude<br>and Space Act so they've not only<br>developed the policy very very quickly<br>they've developed independent large<br>capacity now that capacity comes from<br>rocket labs it comes from a a<br>Californian launch company that again<br>specializes in launching these smaller<br>satellites into low-earth orbit so it's<br>a very specific market that they're<br>looking at but that's a market that<br>every developing space nation and I use<br>the term developing space very carefully<br>here I'm talking about nations that are<br>looking to develop active space programs<br>and all of them are fishing in a very<br>similar pond and New Zealand have stolen<br>a march on pretty much all of them by<br>developing this capacity in partnership<br>with rocket labs of California well<br>thank you very less that's good to know<br>and I'm to be honestly I'm not entirely<br>sure how much is really known within<br>Altair or about about the space capacity<br>and capability that we have with you the<br>nursing industries that we've got it's<br>not something that gets a huge amount of<br>publicity just maybe here or there and<br>in fact that brings us very nicely to<br>the reason why we're having a chat this<br>morning because in these crazy times of<br>corvid with the focus of the world's<br>media being very much on responses to<br>the pandemic and the disaster that is<br>saddling befallen many many nations<br>which we seem to have managed to simply<br>let all we're quite successful here in<br>New Zealand if there's a lot of other<br>public policy issues that have<br>definitely flown under the radar and one<br>that attracted my attention a few weeks<br>ago was over in the US and it was<br>President Trump and I believe on April<br>the 6th around about that time Donald<br>Trump sign an executive order about moon<br>mining in for the United States<br>government and I think interestingly he<br>signed an executive order that said that<br>the United States no longer recognized<br>any aspects of space as part of the<br>global Commons now Donald Trump<br>obviously signed a hell of a lot of<br>executive orders I think he signed the<br>most in in history<br>surly up there so you know you you take<br>these things as they are but then just a<br>couple<br>days ago there was a fairly broad ish<br>media coverage about his intention to<br>start mining on the moon so he's<br>obviously following up not just in word<br>but in action as well and I just wonder<br>if we could maybe touch on a few of<br>those things today I just thought we'd<br>start off by could you just explain is<br>this a significant development I mean is<br>there something that's really different<br>now between the u.s. stances and what<br>it's traditionally being involved in in<br>space exploration in the past this is a<br>really really interesting thing to look<br>at especially now especially at the term<br>that we're talking because of the unique<br>challenges posed by the Cova guy I<br>suspect as academics and probably is as<br>policy makers and as lawmakers and as<br>Representatives we're going to be<br>looking at everything through the corvid<br>lens over the next few years but one<br>thing I do see is that the way out for<br>you know any comic terms is going to be<br>the newer industries that the space<br>industry is going to be leading the way<br>one of the things I've always had to get<br>over and it's something that you'll<br>probably appreciate it's um there was<br>there's a policy guy at the secure World<br>Foundation Brian Whedon he introduced me<br>the term but only if he coined it but he<br>introduced me the term the giggle factor<br>getting over the giggle factor with<br>space he's a real problem because you<br>talk about moon money and it seems<br>science fiction certainly the people of<br>our you know our generational it seems<br>science fiction but actually it's not<br>talking about going the moon and digging<br>up gold and bring it back what they're<br>talking with with with lunar resources<br>is what we call in situ resource<br>utilization now to put that in context<br>let's go back to Apollo<br>every time the Apollo mission was<br>launched every time somebody went to the<br>moon on Apollo it was effectively a<br>brand new mission new rocket new<br>hardware you know the same problems that<br>you have with every new mission is where<br>is it gonna work is it gonna you know is<br>everything gonna click that never went<br>to it so Apollo 17 was just vulnerable<br>to hardware malfunction to you know to<br>any problems with it as Apollo Apollo 8<br>Apollo 9 was so it that's why it was so<br>expensive that's why we didn't keep<br>going back to the crashing why didn't we<br>go back to the moon<br>expensive it was too expensive each each<br>mission was a huge undertaking so there<br>was no sustainability behind it that's<br>what that was the problem<br>because getting the moon's expensive and<br>its card and it's tough so what you want<br>to do is you really want to go there and<br>you want to live off the land now there<br>isn't a lot to live off in them and but<br>there is bits and pieces the solar<br>energy there's little bits of you know I<br>aged water that can be used to make<br>rocket fuel that can be used for energy<br>so what you want to do is you want to<br>land on the moon and you want to use<br>these resources and that's really what<br>the Trump order is about it's about<br>focus in the minds on ok they're looking<br>to go back they've got project Artemis<br>which is a follow-up to Apollo and going<br>back to the moon and staying there now<br>if they're gonna stay there they're not<br>it's not sustainable to bring all the<br>stuff back from Earth and you know have<br>a have a transit in the way that we do<br>with the inter so what I do is work out<br>right okay firstly how are we going to<br>allocate responsibilities and I mean you<br>know if I land on one particular pot but<br>these are pixel lightweight you can get<br>24 hours or I wait and get a whole you<br>know infinite sunlight that's a real<br>useful resource because that's gonna be<br>a lot of energy to power your moon<br>village to power your moon Rovers and<br>whatever you want to do so how do we<br>work how do we allocate that how do we<br>sort of manage that now this is where<br>space law and space policy and space<br>politics and space diplomacy all<br>intersect because the treaty<br>arrangements that we've got at the<br>minute are very much based in Cold War<br>so the design to stop any sort of<br>imperial land grab on the moon anymore<br>the celestial body so there's no<br>appropriation permitted so I prop what<br>is what do we mean by appropriation do<br>we mean sovereignty do we mean<br>territorial grabbing well if I want if<br>I'm there am I not making a claim of<br>appropriation so there's this type of<br>wrestling between these terms these<br>legal terms of you know is it<br>appropriation or no because the treaty<br>to usage so are we using outer space so<br>that's the distinction makanda were kind<br>of hobbling around international lawyers<br>have talked about this for years and<br>years and eventually kind of come to<br>conclusion that okay when you're mining<br>the moon or when you're using the<br>resources you don't want<br>you just want to use the resources that<br>are in place so it's usage come up with<br>usage executive order really just really<br>enforced the extant us position one of<br>the things I got to tell you one of the<br>things about the Trump space position is<br>that there's nothing new in it<br>this is American space policy that has<br>been large for you know as long as the<br>wing in this space they they are aware<br>that they have space donuts and they<br>want to keep space dominance so that's<br>that that's the lens through we've got a<br>we've got to look through that there's<br>no change here doing is they're just<br>being a bit more proactive in promoting<br>that policy so there's a there's the the<br>director of the hate direct<br>international space Council a guy called<br>dr. Scott Pierce he his fingerprints are<br>all over these the you know these latest<br>maneuverings very very shrewd operator<br>very sort of well-versed in an<br>international law very well-respected in<br>in in in space law circles so he's<br>pushing and driving a lot of it and<br>actually it kind of makes a lot of sense<br>because what what bedeviled lunar<br>exploration has been this uncertainty of<br>well can we use these resources how does<br>it work there's a piece of international<br>lore about it called the moon agreement<br>I see its agreement it's not really an<br>agreement only a few states have signed<br>it because it contains this common<br>heritage of mankind principle Conrad did<br>you mankind principal bedeviled on klas<br>that's the United Nations Convention on<br>the law of the sea really caused a lot<br>of problems about because it's a very<br>vague on certain principle you know you<br>ask a roomful of international law<br>academics what the common heritage<br>principle means you get sixteen<br>different answers even if there's only<br>four different academics in the room<br>it's a real sort of you know it's a<br>vague principle nor States gonna<br>voluntarily sign up to give away<br>resources based on that so the moon<br>agreement was it was it was more even<br>but it was original it was it was<br>something that the states thought well<br>you know we can try to have cooperation<br>America had never signed it they've<br>never shown any interest in signing it<br>and all we've had recently the last the<br>executive order and then these<br>discussion on what what they call the<br>Artemis cards are saying look we have<br>not only not signed it we repudiating it<br>and we're doing it again we repudiate it<br>we're not gonna be bound by it what we<br>are going to do is instead we're going<br>to<br>within the outer space tricky now that's<br>something that they've been very keen to<br>stress in all of the work that the but<br>they're working within the OST doubt<br>Space Treaty guidelines and the working<br>within the principles laid down in it so<br>I've kind of come a very long way around<br>of sin and actually what this means is<br>cabinet business as usual but it's also<br>actually a quantum leap forward because<br>it's once-dead growing out and sitting<br>actually this is how we're going to<br>interpret the Outer Space Treaty in<br>respect of lunar resources and in<br>respect of any celestial resources we're<br>gonna use them because they're they're<br>to be used and the Outer Space Treaty<br>says we can use them so canga circling<br>back round what happened last week with<br>the discussion of these Artemis Accords<br>there's no real detail on them but what<br>I'm getting and the sort of mood music<br>that's coming out of the out of washing<br>is that it's going to just be we're<br>going to the moon with Project Artemis<br>if you'd like to be involved this is how<br>we're going to do business and you can<br>sign up to it so it's very much sort of<br>multilateralism but with a singular<br>state approach behind it so it's kind of<br>a hybrid approach again Scott Pierce's<br>finger prints I think pretty much all<br>over this see that that's a very<br>interesting concept 211 such as myself<br>and obviously I don't really know<br>anything about the world of space policy<br>but the idea of multilateralism with you<br>know a single state focus is a very<br>interesting idea to me conceptually<br>because it sounds like we're saying it's<br>collaboration but with a very strong<br>command lead which makes me wonder is<br>actually just another word for<br>unilateralism and it's very interesting<br>he is speak of the idea that the US has<br>always aligned the stuff to one<br>particular treaty hasn't signed up to<br>another one probably because it's in its<br>own interest like you say it's always<br>dominated space exploration to begin<br>with and even more interestingly what is<br>obviously being perceived in the media<br>as a very strongly unilateral approach<br>might not be the case so that's that's<br>interesting so broadly speaking what has<br>been if there's been much what has been<br>need the International responses it's<br>one of those things that you can almost<br>without even looking at the press you<br>could probably guess what was what was<br>said in chat and kept quiet because<br>China has got its own focus Chinese is<br>pursuing a very singular space policy<br>since about late 2018 we've had rumors<br>that there's going to be a new challenge<br>space law coming out haven't seen<br>anything of that yet I'm witty and with<br>really with interest of that there's a<br>season China watch a guy called Andrew<br>Jones who I've worked with and<br>collaborated with before he's got his<br>ears or opening you know we keep<br>thinking it's gonna happen and then it<br>doesn't happen then he gets delayed I<br>think Cove it again is probably gonna<br>put a little delay on it again but we're<br>waiting very keen to say which we're<br>challenged ups on resources are they<br>going to put a law forward and work<br>again within the Outer Space Treaty<br>region and said we're using space and<br>we're going to authorize got to use<br>space in this way which is what America<br>have done because America have passed<br>the 2015 Space Act which again send up<br>an Obama piece of legislation which said<br>we're very much money we're going to<br>allow US companies to train to use to<br>work with these these resources and<br>we're going within the international law<br>framework so we're adhering to our<br>commitments under the Outer Space Treaty<br>the interesting to see if China does<br>that Russia have described it as you<br>know a land grab and I said it's it's<br>akin to I think that one of the courts<br>was it is King to be the Iraq the<br>invasion of Iraq because it's it's such<br>a you know such a blatant attempt to<br>impose their you know impose their<br>superiority on their not a surprising<br>reaction from Russia and but<br>interestingly Russia have not yet moved<br>towards signing the moon agreement<br>because that would be the obvious<br>counter step if you that opposed to it<br>you sign the moon agreement just the<br>reason the moon agreement is floundering<br>and doesn't really have any advocates is<br>because none of the major space powers<br>and by major space powers I mean the<br>likes of America China Russia you know<br>they they haven't touched it Japan they<br>haven't got anywhere near it<br>the couple of European countries have<br>dallied with it and recently there was a<br>bit of interest in it but really truly<br>it's a question of well America<br>well we're doing this we're not going<br>with the moon agreement we're not<br>allowing it and we're actively<br>repudiating he so he can't even become a<br>custom he can't even slide into<br>customary international law and the<br>obvious answer is well if you oppose it<br>that much of Russia if Russia thinks<br>it's that bad why not sign a moon great<br>something happened<br>just just one just one final quick<br>question reading what is next for the<br>moon line in approach for sustainability<br>of resources in space generally and I<br>guess does New Zealand what role could<br>New Zealand play in that<br>well I think firstly in terms of New<br>Zealand New Zealand are very heavily<br>aligned with America through the rocket<br>labs you know project if I can call it<br>that all the rocket labs collaboration<br>and so I see that collaboration getting<br>stronger I see companies in America<br>looking to New Zealand's a really sort<br>of friendly place to launch from so it<br>would surprise me if New Zealand didn't<br>in some way align itself with American<br>with American interests because I think<br>that's that's all he says I think the<br>United Kingdom will align itself as well<br>which would be really interesting to see<br>a major European Space Agency power saw<br>heavily slant towards an on moon<br>agreement settlement I think I think<br>Russia and China are gonna be<br>interesting seeing which way they jump<br>if if if the Chinese space law has<br>resources within it then I can see the<br>moon you know I can see the moon<br>agreement withering on the vine and<br>dying I think it probably is dead<br>anywhere because America repudiated it<br>but honestly I think what we're gonna<br>see is firstly America go back to them<br>and now the question is when they've set<br>the target of 2024 I have to say I'm<br>extremely skeptical whether they'll make<br>they there or not I think with corvid<br>with us with the economics that that<br>means I don't think there'll be the<br>budget that you need to get to them and<br>getting to the moon is expensive it took<br>you know it took a Manhattan Project<br>style attempt to get them there in 1969<br>it still takes a huge amount of cash to<br>get to the moon now and that's gonna be<br>one thing there's going to be in really<br>short supply so I would be stretching 24<br>to 27 28 maybe<br>let's say the if they make it back by<br>the way by the 2030 they've done really<br>well Shatner will be looking to go to<br>the moon as well China have got a really<br>interesting and aggressive lunar<br>exploration program the Chang a program<br>there are looking to get a sample return<br>mission in the next few years they're<br>looking to put boots on the moon as well<br>so I think what we're going to see is<br>from years and years of inactivity and I<br>think we're poised to really see the<br>moon become a serious sort of area of<br>policy debate of legal debate and you<br>know of actual technical advancement<br>which I think you know he did it's about<br>time<br>so we're facing another space race then<br>potentially yeah yeah I think so I think<br>we're certainly going to see an increase<br>in space activity the likes of which we<br>haven't seen since the 60s well on that<br>Christopher just say thank you very much<br>indeed<br>it just goes to show you you see we talk<br>about these things that may seem a<br>little bit up scoops and miss you a<br>little bit rarefied but even ideas such<br>as pulse in space law have direct<br>impacts on global DeVault diplomacy<br>global leadership notions of<br>sustainability and so many different<br>directly affecting factors for everyone<br>will be watching this so thank you very<br>very much thank you for your time and I<br>wish you very well space here for the<br>rest of the lockdown</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
