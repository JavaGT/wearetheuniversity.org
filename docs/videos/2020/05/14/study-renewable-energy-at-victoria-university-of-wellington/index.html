Study Renewable Energy Systems at Victoria University of Wellington and learn how to help build stronger communities and a more resilient economy.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Renewable energy is a super exciting<br>field to be working in at the moment<br>because it's so dynamic and we have such<br>a range of areas of research that are<br>involved, everything from electronics<br>artificial intelligence through to<br>policy-making which is all coming<br>together to solve a problem.<br>Victoria University of Wellington offers students the unique opportunity to study towards<br>specialised programs in renewable energy<br>systems. The program that we've developed<br>is really well-rounded so you've got<br>everything from technical right through<br>to policymaking. We're at a tipping point<br>New Zealand and the world wants to<br>decarbonize we want to reduce emissions<br>such that we don't have 1.5 degree<br>warming two degree warming. The<br>electricity sector has a great role to<br>play. There are lots of roles within<br>electricity companies and the<br>engineering world for you to be involved<br>in. I've worked in the New Zealand<br>electricity sector for more than 20<br>years, it's a fascinating field and<br>there's lots more to come. Here at<br>Robinson Research Institute we involve<br>undergraduate students and our research<br>projects through the final year project<br>that they might do and also we employ a<br>range of summer students as interns.<br>As researchers we're changing the world<br>because we're creating the future.<br>We need more researchers to help us with<br>that task, we need researchers who want<br>to research new market structures,<br>different regulations policies and even<br>into the realm of human behaviour. I'm<br>excited to work in the renewable energy<br>industry when I graduate as it's an<br>emerging industry with so many different<br>fields that I could delve into whether<br>it's on the hardware and the technical<br>side or more of a foreign aid sense<br>being involved with rural projects.<br>Many communities in New Zealand and elsewhere<br>do not have access to energy to provide<br>for sustainable livelihoods and this is<br>a key focus area here at Victoria<br>University of Wellington to develop<br>renewable energy systems to cater for<br>those leads. Being in a capital, Victoria<br>University of Wellington is<br>well-positioned to engage with all the<br>relevant stakeholders in the energy<br>sector including industry and<br>policymakers.<br>At Victoria we pride ourselves on having a collaborative approach to learning.<br>We keep our doors open for students to come and have a chat as much as possible and<br>we have plenty of hands-on experience in<br>the labs.<br>As a young person leaving high school it can feel a bit futile trying to combat climate change by yourself but<br>coming to study renewable energy<br>actually gives you the skills needed to<br>try make a difference</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
