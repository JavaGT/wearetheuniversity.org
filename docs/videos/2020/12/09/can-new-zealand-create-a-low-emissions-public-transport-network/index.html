These emissions have been growing steadily, but now need to significantly decline.<br>The workshop will bring together researchers, policy makers, campaigners, and industry participants to explore the potential for New Zealand to significantly reduce transport emissions both within and between regions. The re-establishment of the passenger rail network has gained popularity. However, coordinating rail with an improved long-distance bus network, town and regional cycling, walking and last-mile shuttle services could relieve our national dependence on cars and aviation, as well as providing many social and economic benefits.<br><br><br>Presenters:<br>Professor James Renwick: Reducing transport emissions<br>Thomas Nash: Rebuilding a rail network<br>Paul Callister: Upgrading our long-distance bus network<br>Professor Robert McLachlan: The future of aviation<br>Heidi O’Callahan: Why a national public transport network?<br><br><br>About our presenters<br> <br>James Renwick is a climate researcher who studies Southern Hemisphere climate variability, and the impacts of climate change on the Pacific, New Zealand and the Antarctic.

0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so welcome this is a zoom discussion<br>on the question of whether new zealand<br>can create<br>a low emissions national public<br>transport<br>network and if so how so we're focusing<br>very much on the context<br>of transport emissions<br>which as you know constitute something<br>in the vicinity of 40<br>of uh total carbon dioxide emissions and<br>around 20 percent of<br>overall emissions depending on the<br>global warming potential<br>measure that's used and<br>we are operating in a context where we<br>know globally we need to reduce<br>our overall carbon dioxide emissions by<br>around 45 to 50 percent by<br>2030 if we're to have any reasonable<br>chance of avoiding<br>more than 1.5 degrees of warming and<br>then go<br>to zero net carbon dioxide emissions<br>uh by 2050 at the latest and then<br>negative net emissions so i'd like to<br>begin by just thanking paul callister<br>for setting up this<br>uh this zoom discussion and<br>uh also for being willing to contribute<br>as one of six<br>uh esteemed contributors if i could just<br>briefly<br>mention a few administrative matters<br>then i'll introduce the speakers and<br>then we'll get straight underway<br>so um you're welcome to be visible or<br>not<br>through your video<br>but it is nice to see people but i<br>appreciate you may be coming and going<br>and<br>and if you want to turn your videos off<br>that's fine um<br>uh please remain uh muted while people<br>are speaking<br>um but there will be an opportunity<br>later obviously for you to contribute<br>um verbally this discussion is being<br>recorded<br>um so well it should be recorded<br>i it doesn't yes it is recording it says<br>so that's good um uh please feel free to<br>use the chat function<br>during the presentations and it may well<br>be that<br>we can get some answers uh during the<br>presentations not by the presenter who's<br>speaking but by others<br>and please when it comes to when we come<br>to the discussion time<br>um uh please use the hand<br>uh function or wave your hands<br>and and i will bring you in uh as i'm<br>able<br>so just very quickly uh we've got six uh<br>contributors to this session<br>so we're going to have quite a few<br>presentations and i imagine they will<br>take<br>uh at least an hour so we're going to<br>start with uh<br>professor james renwick from victoria<br>university and also the climate change<br>commission<br>and james will be talking more generally<br>about the subject of reducing transport<br>emissions<br>he'll be followed by thomas nash who's a<br>member of the wellington regional<br>council and chair of its climate<br>committee<br>and thomas will talk about rebuilding<br>the rail network<br>uh he'll be followed with a response uh<br>by ben<br>ormsby who's from the ministry of<br>transport and who's part been part of<br>the<br>ministry's future of right rail project<br>fourth will be paul callister uh paul is<br>an economist and a senior associate of<br>the institute for governance and policy<br>studies<br>and i should have mentioned this event<br>as being sponsored by the institute<br>for which i'm very thankful and paul<br>will be talking about upgrading our long<br>distance coach network<br>the penultimate speaker is robert<br>mclaughlin<br>from massey university robert is a<br>distinguished professor<br>uh applied mathematics at massey and<br>he'll be talking about the future of<br>aviation<br>uh and finally but not least uh heidi<br>o'callaghan who is beaming him from<br>auckland uh we'll be speaking on the<br>subject of why do we need a national<br>public transport<br>network and she'll be trying to draw<br>some of the threads together from the<br>previous<br>discussions uh heidi is an analyst and<br>author<br>at greater auckland and a civil engineer<br>by train<br>so without any more ado um james i'll<br>turn to you and if you'd like to screen<br>share and we'll get underway and i will<br>endeavor to keep people<br>to their time all right all the best<br>okay<br>thank you very much jonathan<br>let's uh let's get going i'll just<br>the right foot of my screen here here we<br>go<br>all right so hopefully everybody can see<br>my title slide<br>yes yes it's it's fine yeah okay so this<br>everyone well maybe everyone recognizes<br>this picture from<br>uh nzta taken<br>near plymouth a couple of weekends ago<br>flooding event i thought it nicely<br>captured a<br>impact of climate change and a little<br>bit of transport as well<br>so i'm not sure if i've i'm going to say<br>anything that you haven't<br>heard before we'll find out i guess but<br>just<br>very much a general overview of<br>where we're at with carbon dioxide<br>climate change<br>transport emissions so just to start off<br>you know here's the problem we've got<br>this massive spike<br>in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere this<br>is the<br>one of my favorite graphics the last 13<br>000 years of carbon dioxide atmospheric<br>carbon dioxide with the<br>massive increase uh since the industrial<br>revolution and you know the times<br>the human time scale which has really<br>brought this about is much much shorter<br>than the<br>climate system time scale that<br>ultimately we'll<br>remove it again give them time<br>um and that those time scales i mean<br>there are various time scales<br>there's short time scales to do with<br>exchange of the ocean<br>and the biosphere and then there are<br>much longer time scales to do<br>with really geological processes so<br>there's a nice paper written<br>10 years or so ago by susan solomon and<br>i was looking<br>at the future of carbon dioxide in the<br>atmosphere<br>with a pause or a stop in emissions<br>at different levels of atmospheric co2<br>indicated by the numbers<br>on the sides of the graphic<br>um so we're not quite at 450 parts per<br>million but we're getting pretty close<br>um obviously the higher you go the<br>longer the stuff stays in the air and<br>more of it stays in the air so<br>this this graphic goes out to 3 000 so<br>it's the next thousand years and it<br>demonstrates that<br>the dashed line at the bottom is the<br>pre-industrial level and even if we<br>stop emissions today essentially we<br>won't be back to pre-industrial carbon<br>dioxide<br>for uh well actually thousands of years<br>into the future<br>unless we can develop negative emissions<br>technology which is<br>still a bit of a pipe dream so co2<br>is the big issue because it has this<br>very long<br>lifetime and<br>new zealand actually puts out a lot of<br>this stuff jonathan mentioned<br>um here's our our<br>emissions profile from the last um<br>national inventory put out by mfe<br>earlier this year<br>44 of our emissions are carbon dioxide<br>methane and agriculture get all the<br>press um<br>for various reasons but really um<br>one of the big issues for new zealand<br>like every country is carbon dioxide<br>emissions and it's an area where we can<br>make some<br>rapid progress i think more easily than<br>we can with<br>um ruminant animals so just breaking<br>that down a little bit from the<br>last national inventory from the mfe<br>here's<br>emissions by gas the darker lines darker<br>bars are<br>1990 emissions and the lighter blue bars<br>are 2018 emissions and you may or may<br>not be able to read the numbers on the<br>vertical scalar and<br>kilo tons of co2 equivalent and just to<br>make the point that carbon dioxide is<br>the first<br>set of bars there there's been a big<br>increase in co2 emissions<br>in the last 30 years um yeah 30 years<br>28 years more so than<br>for other gases that are considered<br>under the unhcc<br>and when you look more closely what you<br>know and find that the biggest increase<br>um comes from transport in terms of fuel<br>combustion which is where most of the<br>carbon dioxide emissions in new zealand<br>come from so manufacturing and so on<br>haven't really changed all that much in<br>fact the energy industry has gone down<br>but transport emissions which was mostly<br>white vehicles i.e the likes of us<br>driving to and from the shops and so on<br>have been responsible for the biggest<br>increase<br>in co2 emissions in the country and this<br>is yeah<br>this is over the last 30 years but it<br>would apply<br>further back in time i'm sure so that's<br>that's the sort of scene i guess that's<br>why we're talking about this today<br>because<br>it's a big issue for new zealand and it<br>is an issue that we can make some<br>progress on<br>so what are the actions that we need to<br>take and i think this is<br>fairly obvious um<br>electrifying the vehicle fleet um is a<br>great idea<br>and it's easy to say something like that<br>it takes time to do we can't just wave a<br>magic wand<br>and electrify everything overnight but<br>we can certainly<br>move in the right direction more quickly<br>you know the government's announcement<br>of a<br>climate emergency recently and the idea<br>that the public sector the public<br>service would be<br>carbon neutral by 2025 great step<br>and that would involve electrifying or<br>largely electrifying the<br>public service vehicle fleet which would<br>really push the market in new zealand<br>but government can bring in things like<br>um<br>essentially incentives for people to buy<br>ev's it's not going to work for<br>everybody<br>but it could work for a lot more people<br>than<br>at the um time um stopping importing<br>internal combustion engine vehicles and<br>setting emission standards for the ones<br>we have you know we have one of the<br>older flights in the world<br>and uh we're one of the few countries<br>that don't have emissions standards for<br>transport which was seemed rather<br>strange<br>and and at the same time as we're<br>importing all these electric vehicles<br>we do need to improve charging<br>infrastructure and it's not<br>it's there and my local supermarket has<br>a couple of um<br>charging points in the car park that's<br>great<br>but if you and and most of the charging<br>happens<br>at people's homes anyway but if you're<br>traveling around if we really are going<br>to electrify the fleet<br>i think we need a better infrastructure<br>across the country so that it's not<br>not a risk or not a coin toss as to when<br>you're going to get the<br>napier or wherever if you're driving a<br>long distance there might only be one or<br>two places you can charge your vehicle<br>along the way um and we'll hear a lot<br>more about this but um<br>other obvious action is to boost public<br>transport<br>make sure that's renewably powered i i<br>got off one of those vehicles at the top<br>here<br>only an hour or so ago and the transport<br>public transport network in wellington<br>is pretty good it could be<br>better it could be more reliable it<br>could be more accessible it could be<br>more affordable and i think investment<br>in public transport<br>really does pay dividends and in terms<br>of sort of civic engagement as much as<br>reducing greenhouse gas emissions and<br>integrating<br>public transport with active transport<br>so making sure<br>yes i can take my bicycle on the train<br>if i really want to<br>but it's not entirely easy at the moment<br>with the way the wellington trains are<br>set up<br>and you can take a bicycle on the bus or<br>clip it on the front of the brush in<br>wellington these days which is great<br>but we could go further with that kind<br>of thinking<br>around helping those who are cycling and<br>proving<br>you know softening that's i think we<br>could make great strides there and that<br>would be helpful for public health<br>in a number of ways as well as again<br>reducing the missions<br>uh getting and hopefully not treating on<br>anyone's toes here<br>saying these things but just just an<br>entree i guess<br>road transport and freight transport<br>increasing<br>the use of rails generally especially<br>for freight but also for<br>passenger services uh a good idea<br>ideally<br>again uh renewably powered so<br>electrifying<br>main all of the main trunk line and<br>other lines would be<br>a very good idea uh possibly more use of<br>coastal shipping i'm not<br>i'm no guru on this kind of thing but<br>uh that would be saving an overall<br>emissions as opposed to road freight<br>um and possibly there are some renewable<br>options<br>on that front as well and there's been a<br>lot of talk and i've heard a lot lately<br>about<br>a hydrogen economy and hydrogen being<br>the ticket for<br>heavy vehicles um trucks and road<br>freight<br>others might know more than i do i'm i'm<br>not seeing it as a magic bullet or<br>something that's going to be<br>huge in future i would i'd like to hear<br>more about this but it is on the table<br>as a<br>possible option and there are some<br>hydrogen powered vehicles<br>coming on stream already because of the<br>image of a<br>hyundai truck and uh yeah not just<br>um heavy trucks but also um<br>private vehicles there are some around<br>and we'll see how that developed<br>so that that was pretty much all i had<br>to say i just wanted to finish off<br>the last slide just to remind everybody<br>or<br>think about what it is we need to do and<br>jonathan mentioned this at the beginning<br>again we need to be<br>looking at if we're stopping global<br>warming<br>at around one and a half degrees then we<br>need to get to<br>50 reduction in emissions especially of<br>carbon dioxide in the next decade<br>and get to about zero by 2050.<br>and there was a paper published by johan<br>rostrom in<br>co from the stockholm center in science<br>a few years ago looking at this and they<br>proposed this kind of carbon law that<br>we've got to harbor missions every<br>decade<br>essentially and i just i was looking at<br>this this morning and reminding myself<br>of just the section headings i i liked a<br>lot they<br>they tell the story so you have a look<br>at this paper<br>talks about this decade 2020 to 2030<br>being the decade of<br>herculean efforts and i totally endorsed<br>that we do need to pull out all the<br>stocks and<br>a lot of the stuff we're talking about<br>with transport emissions i think<br>it doesn't have to be that peculiar and<br>it might be expensive in some ways<br>but not all that difficult and then<br>assuming we get to that halfway mark in<br>2030 we have<br>technology and innovation has really<br>been inspired and we have many<br>breakthroughs at least hopefully<br>in the following decade and then by the<br>2040s we're actually we've not done most<br>of the change we need and we're just<br>sort of helping to to reinforce the<br>change so<br>uh i like that thinking but the upfront<br>decade that we are in now and will be in<br>2021 in a matter of days<br>um it is the herculean one and we do<br>need to make as much progress as we can<br>as fast as we can and that's<br>my life well thank you very much james<br>that was an excellent introduction<br>um uh we now turn to thomas thomas nash<br>so thomas if you have some slides if you<br>could um<br>screen share and begin your presentation<br>on<br>rebuilding the rail network and while<br>you're getting ready i note that<br>there's quite a few messages on the<br>chats<br>box so that's good and some interesting<br>points being raised<br>and i'm sure they will be discussed<br>zoom if not by some of the speakers in<br>the next 40-50 minutes<br>so thomas greetings welcome<br>and uh how are you going<br>uh good thanks um yeah what are you on<br>just trying to see how i can<br>get all this done let's go to screen<br>share at the bottom<br>yeah terrific okay well that's one<br>anyway i mean it's not exactly the one i<br>was hoping to<br>use but i'll see what i can do um okay<br>well<br>jonathan kirapal thanks for organizing<br>in yeah<br>so yeah i guess i come at this um<br>whole topic as uh as a counselor<br>um regional councillor for greater<br>wellington and<br>uh the chair of our climate committee as<br>you mentioned jonathan<br>and i also come at it as someone who<br>has lived and worked in other countries<br>and particularly in europe where you<br>know rail travel<br>is sort of a completely normal expected<br>um way of of getting around and really a<br>preferred<br>way of getting around convenient um<br>it's part of a part of the sort of<br>culture<br>um and so yeah i guess i guess i'm<br>hopeful but<br>that we'll be able to get to this point<br>in fact i think i think we i'm<br>i'm convinced that we will be able to<br>get to uh a point where<br>where rail travel is a much more<br>embedded part of our everyday lives<br>um in new zealand um so the first thing<br>to say<br>was i think i'll just i'll just leave<br>this um i'll just leave this thing up<br>there<br>because i can't find any other i can't<br>find the way to get my other<br>slides up but um i i wanted to put some<br>slides up that would show that<br>uh first thing i wanted to say which is<br>an encouraging thing is that whenever i<br>do<br>a tweet so i do i dabble in twitter and<br>whenever i do a tweet with a<br>with an image of a train or something<br>about<br>railways it it is invariably<br>the most um well the<br>most widely viewed tweaks i've ever done<br>so uh i did a tweet of the harpoon<br>phenomena viaduct around ohakune with um<br>with the northern explorer going over it<br>and you got like 40<br>000 views which is you know about 40 000<br>views more than<br>my average tweet would get so there is a<br>there is a i guess i'm saying that at<br>the outset to say<br>there's a deeply um held<br>connection towards railways um still<br>in this um in this country so that's<br>encouraging um<br>and then the other thing i was going to<br>say was just um<br>over the last few months we've we've had<br>quite an interesting experience<br>a positive experience with fellow<br>councils district councils and regional<br>councils along the<br>north island main trunk line route<br>where you know the northern explorer<br>kiwi rail stopped the northern explorer<br>um<br>but during the the lockdown the the<br>covered quarantine<br>period and they they didn't restart it<br>afterwards and we kind of suspected that<br>maybe<br>they didn't really intend to restart it<br>because they didn't think it was worth<br>it<br>uh so we sort of mobilized um and we got<br>all<br>i think was 16 councils that wrote a<br>letter um<br>to kiwi rail and we we we mobilized a<br>bit and<br>that was quite successful uh we got we<br>got the thing restarted maybe never<br>going to restart it anyway but<br>um as a result of that collaboration<br>between<br>uh councils along the north island main<br>track line there is now a conversation<br>happening<br>um between those that collective<br>councils and kiwi rail<br>about whether we could get a some<br>additional<br>services uh that would run<br>in a business case so well there's work<br>towards a business case for<br>a northern connector as opposed to a<br>northern explorer<br>and this northern connector would pick<br>up some of the other um<br>you know railway stations that that have<br>been missed out by<br>um by the by the normal explorer<br>in that kind of central north island<br>area so so that's that's quite good so<br>that's encouraging<br>and of course you know the railways were<br>a<br>they were a major part of the transport<br>system that<br>that underpinned our economy and our<br>society in this country for<br>for many decades so uh there's a there's<br>a big opportunity i think to<br>to rebuild the braille network<br>uh yeah as i said i i i guess i think<br>um not to be too deterministic about<br>this but i do feel that it's inevitable<br>really that our<br>regional and intercity rail system<br>scales up<br>massively in this country it's just<br>really a question of when<br>uh when we decide to to start investing<br>in it properly<br>and yeah i was i was just going to refer<br>to the<br>the the green party proposal during the<br>election of uh<br>they proposed a 9 billion regional rail<br>plan over 10 years<br>and that sounds maybe it sounds like a<br>lot of money but<br>to put it in context after the global<br>financial<br>crisis the government spent about 12<br>billion dollars<br>on a relatively small set of motorways<br>so you'd get a lot more bang for your<br>buck<br>um with a with a rail plan so i guess<br>the but there's a lot of work to do<br>obviously um<br>and i'm just going to run through a few<br>points and then stop<br>um but i was basically thinking about a<br>little bit about the infrastructure<br>uh think a little bit about figuring out<br>who does what<br>um and then maybe talk a bit about the<br>sort of cultural shift<br>that will be required and then maybe a<br>few points on<br>what what we might want to focus on next<br>um so right just to say thomas if you<br>can be very brief about each point<br>please<br>otherwise we'll be here already i've<br>been ravaging<br>right infrastructure first um the tracks<br>will need to do a lot of double tracking<br>in certain areas straightening of the<br>tracks<br>um and obviously maintenance question<br>there is<br>where to focus uh and i would suggest<br>massively increasing<br>capacity in the metro areas second<br>trains we've got to buy<br>a substantial number of new trains<br>we could look at tilt trains which would<br>be able to run at a maximum speed of 160<br>kph<br>we should probably also be looking at<br>battery electric dual multiple units<br>and i would suggest we want national<br>procurement uh of<br>um of these uh to get the best<br>value the question about electrification<br>of the lines in some areas this may not<br>be worth it it might be better to go<br>battery electric for example the<br>wellington's wide upper line<br>might be better value to get battery<br>electric trains um<br>rather than electrify that and yeah just<br>a point about construction and expertise<br>and planning um be a good idea to see<br>what we can do to keep<br>the contractors that are in this country<br>for things like city rail link<br>here so they can work on upgrading our<br>rail system<br>who does what so there's a there's<br>there's a<br>this is quite political i guess but<br>right now kiwi rail<br>is in charge of the tracks they're in<br>charge of the freight uh and they're in<br>charge of the<br>intercity uh services that we have which<br>are tourism services<br>commuter rail is done by councils and<br>council control organizations<br>um there's a question there about<br>whether some other<br>reconfiguration of entities or<br>responsibilities may be a new entity for<br>passenger rail<br>who knows um and and what about<br>commercial operators like transdev<br>uh which runs the uh trends in<br>wellington auckland<br>what about them maybe running a sleeper<br>train they've suggested that<br>uh culture yeah i guess there's a<br>cultural shift from sort of<br>the individualism that we have with uh<br>the convenience and freedom of<br>driving in our cars to point to point<br>and then the kind of collectivism<br>of being in a in a public transport<br>environment with other people<br>which is normal in other countries and<br>to an extent in wellington<br>and auckland but not so much uh the rest<br>of the country<br>yeah i guess thinking about the<br>experience on board how how<br>enjoyable it can be to be on a train and<br>i guess slowing down about<br>the ability to work from home now which<br>is more accepted<br>that should help to to make trains<br>long-term journeys<br>um more more attractive and then<br>i was just going to mention anthony<br>tunnell the musician uh<br>an artist who has done the rail land um<br>performances that's a i think this is a<br>helpful way to<br>to start to embed this cultural shift in<br>uh around the country<br>three very very brief final points one<br>in terms of what we do next<br>i think it would be useful if we could<br>get a a pledge<br>from organizations and businesses saying<br>that if<br>a sleeper train should be worse to be<br>introduced for example<br>that those organizations would would<br>pledge to uh purchase tickets on that<br>for their<br>for their employees and as you as you<br>mentioned with<br>with as someone mentioned with the the<br>net zero um public service by 2025<br>commitment<br>you could imagine that there would be a<br>lot of organizations that might want to<br>to do that um yeah i guess<br>i guess we do need a bit more facts<br>figures images maps artists impressions<br>to start to give give an idea of what<br>what this rail system would look like<br>and why<br>people would like to be on it and then<br>we're going to need to go to the hard<br>edge<br>of the actual business cases which is<br>quite expensive to do<br>um it needs a lot of expertise um but<br>yeah that's what i was that's what i was<br>going to<br>say i'll leave you with that well thank<br>you very much<br>thomas and sorry to give you a hurry up<br>i'm just conscious that we<br>uh we've got quite a few present<br>presenters um now ben<br>uh i think you were going to respond and<br>perhaps made some make some specific<br>comments of your own so if you're able<br>to<br>screen share with your presentation that<br>would be great and while you're just<br>getting organized<br>uh just to say thank you for the<br>excellent chat comments that are coming<br>in and the responses<br>um uh lots of important points being<br>made<br>um i don't have um i don't have any<br>slides to share i thought i was<br>gonna i guess just sort of respond or<br>add to what um<br>what thomas has said so that's fine go<br>ahead great thanks jonathan<br>all right so um yeah i'm ben ormsby i'm<br>part of the<br>place making and urban development team<br>at the ministry of transport<br>um and so my team's role i guess is<br>about how we integrate transport with<br>urban development<br>within cities and between cities and<br>regions<br>um and i guess just thinking about what<br>the<br>the ministry of transport role is um<br>it's at that system setting level so um<br>i think some of the things that<br>that maybe thomas referenced around who<br>does what that's the sort of thing that<br>the ministry is thinking about in terms<br>of<br>rail and passenger rail um and i think<br>one of the one of the key things<br>um that sort of guides our work is that<br>the transport<br>outcomes framework and i don't know if<br>people are um familiar with that or not<br>but it sort of covers the range of<br>outcomes uh transport outcomes in terms<br>of access<br>you know health and safety of people<br>environmental sustainability and<br>resilience<br>which really sort of underpins how we<br>how we design the system<br>and so i'll just put in a plug for our<br>newly refreshed website<br>transport.govt.nz<br>which has a lot of information that i'm<br>going to talk about today and it's<br>reasonably easy to search and you can<br>filter by mode as well if you're<br>interested<br>so future of rail started about three<br>years ago<br>and this was uh came through the<br>the government uh what that came in in<br>2017<br>and they were thinking about um more<br>sustainable long-term funding<br>and a a planning model i guess for rail<br>and for the role of rail in the<br>transport system<br>and so this was looking at things<br>such as investing in rail i guess to to<br>turn things around from the managed<br>decline that had been happening over<br>a number of decades i guess since the<br>privatization<br>and then um re<br>uh the public purchase of rail back into<br>the government<br>and thinking about i guess more from a<br>freight perspective so growing key rails<br>network<br>and and looking at a mode shift from<br>things such as supporting connectivity<br>between the regions<br>and economic development as well as<br>growing the urban commuter rail and<br>regional rail<br>and giving more priority through the<br>government policy statement for<br>for land transport so starting to look<br>at whether funding could come through<br>the national land transport fund rather<br>and so with this review some of the<br>recommendations were<br>were aimed at sort of integrating<br>to enable better investment decisions i<br>guess across across road and rail<br>investments<br>and providing kiwi rail with longer term<br>funding and<br>greater certainty and then also a better<br>transparency for<br>government expenditure on rail so this<br>is through like the projects and<br>and spending that come through the<br>national land transport fund<br>so the um so the rail act was<br>was passed um and that was one of the<br>key outcomes from the<br>from the review and that was looking at<br>integrating<br>um the network rail network planning and<br>funding into the national land transport<br>system<br>so to go with that a long-term plan was<br>needed<br>to guide the the government investment<br>investment and also<br>supporting private sector decision<br>making<br>and this this<br>this guidance i guess sits alongside the<br>the government policy statement and<br>informs the investment that that happens<br>and um what this means is through the<br>gps we can focus on<br>um more of the non-commercial benefits<br>of rails so currently it's<br>it's kiwi rail's mandate is around<br>running a business and i guess what we<br>see<br>from passenger rail is that there are<br>other other benefits<br>other social benefits other access<br>benefits that that people are looking<br>for from rail<br>um and so i guess sort of tuning to the<br>to the um the infrastructure side of<br>things and what and what thomas<br>mentioned<br>there is at the moment the investments<br>focused on sort of<br>and so um you'll see for the likes of<br>auckland<br>um city rail link which i guess is a new<br>piece of infrastructure but really is<br>about unlocking the benefits of the<br>the whole system um the third main line<br>extending the electrification to pukakoi<br>and the new station jet jury so a lot of<br>not so much expanding the network but<br>making the network<br>work better and so<br>providing providing enhanced services<br>and better infrastructure<br>to make the most of the the passenger<br>rail network and similar things<br>happening in wellington as well with the<br>renewals and maintenance work happening<br>on the wellington network double<br>tracking<br>strength them to upper hut and<br>and then also i guess as thomas<br>mentioned the<br>the northern explorer those are the kiwi<br>rail kind of tourist services<br>um improving the infrastructure to<br>support them and then<br>you know with this potential expansion<br>in the future<br>um i guess um<br>some of the key things that have also<br>um come out recently if we're thinking<br>about<br>passenger rail and building up a<br>passenger rail network<br>is tahuia which is the new hamilton to<br>auckland service<br>and so yeah this was some this was a key<br>thing that was going to be<br>um introduced i guess it had been tried<br>before<br>and um but the the sort of need was<br>expressed again to<br>to try and have this service start and<br>although there's been some delays with<br>um<br>with the opening due to the um<br>the issue the issues on the auckland<br>network i guess with the role in contact<br>fatigue and<br>the maintenance issues um that is<br>sort of tenderly scheduled for february<br>and that's really an expansion of the<br>of the regional network to start<br>thinking about connections between<br>cities that<br>that didn't exist before or haven't<br>existed for a while<br>i should say um and the other one<br>another key one i guess is the capital<br>connection so between palmerston north<br>and wellington getting refurbished<br>through the new zealand upgrade program<br>so even though um it was<br>quite a roads heavy sort of package of<br>investment<br>some of it is going towards enhancing<br>and i guess looking to the future one of<br>the key projects that i've been involved<br>in<br>is the hamilton to auckland rapid rail<br>and so this is<br>um this is really looking at providing a<br>service an inter-regional service that<br>goes beyond that tourist<br>you know tourist design tourist level of<br>train service and a<br>so sort of an indicative business case<br>has been prepared over the last<br>year or so um which is um available on<br>the<br>transport website and this is really<br>looking at that<br>160 kilometer an hour potentially up to<br>250 kilometer an hour<br>commuter or far service to connect<br>hamilton and auckland<br>and also looking at is there an off an<br>offline solution or a new<br>a new um corridor rail corridor between<br>those two cities<br>so this is really starting to get into<br>that sort of advanced<br>rail planning and thinking about<br>building a network<br>for you know the next 100 years and<br>being fit for purpose i guess for those<br>reducing carbon emissions and<br>and integrating integrating land use<br>and and transport so particularly in the<br>auckland hamilton<br>tauranga triangle really thinking about<br>where growth's happening where where the<br>demand for<br>for housing and businesses are and then<br>connecting those<br>um providing people with alternatives<br>rather than than just<br>driving or relying on the motorways and<br>just one more minute please<br>yeah i guess that's uh that's kind of<br>all i had to<br>to really comment on i guess in terms of<br>the um<br>wrapping it all together the the review<br>of<br>um the future of rail and the rail plan<br>which is<br>which is still draft but will be<br>released um next year<br>is really starting to drive the system<br>towards providing these sorts of<br>solutions<br>and thinking about things from an<br>inter-regional perspective which hasn't<br>been<br>all right ben thank you very much for<br>those comments and we look forward to<br>seeing the uh<br>the plan when it comes out um uh i hope<br>there will be some degree of urgency<br>in in this process because as jim has<br>highlighted uh<br>we have very little time from a<br>planetary<br>um but thank you um now paul<br>uh over to you um on the topic of<br>upgrading our long<br>distance coach network good morning<br>um it's been an interesting discussion<br>so far<br>but i'm talking about something that<br>actually still works<br>at the moment i'm of a generation that<br>use the integrated bus and train<br>services provided by<br>new zealand railways and just looking at<br>the videos of people on<br>today i think many of you probably use<br>them<br>but in recent years i've been<br>undertaking research<br>on long-distance coaches and as part of<br>that i've been using them<br>quite quite substantially including<br>trips between<br>paikakuriki and and auckland and<br>it's it's both a good and a bad story<br>and the good story is that we already<br>have a long distance coach network<br>um intercity run about 130 services<br>per day we don't have data on the<br>numbers traveling but it's likely to be<br>in the thousands on a good day if you<br>think 40 people might be on each coach<br>and these coaches link every small town<br>and every large city<br>in new zealand so they're already there<br>we also don't know who actually uses<br>these coaches<br>but i suspect from my own travels it's<br>mainly young people and older people<br>and they seem to be over represented<br>from the poorer communities so when you<br>go through places like manukau<br>peru tocara you see<br>more of those sort of people getting on<br>and off so<br>we don't have an ethnic breakdown but i<br>suspect<br>maori and pacific people and new<br>immigrants<br>are over represented in the users<br>pre-covered we also had a number of<br>tourist services aimed at young people<br>first of all there was naked bash which<br>then got taken over by mana<br>and then skip which is run by intercity<br>but skip's not<br>running at the moment long distance<br>coaches are already a low emission form<br>of travel<br>and if you look at the various carbon<br>calculators<br>you find that if you compare driving in<br>an ordinary ice car<br>or flying the coach trip is about 80<br>percent less<br>carbon dioxide emissions so the<br>technology's<br>already there and what we're also seeing<br>is that<br>the technology will get better they're<br>already<br>experimenting with electric buses<br>overseas<br>and and hydrogen buses i know there's a<br>big argument about hydrogen but<br>certainly<br>the electric buses are being trialled in<br>north america<br>and europe so we're going to see even<br>lower emissions um<br>coming on fairly fairly soon and then<br>they're not the fantasy that often we<br>talk about with electric planes<br>and hydrogen powered planes which may be<br>there but not in the time frame that we<br>we also know that as both thomas and ben<br>have talked about<br>that there's a lot of planning going on<br>about trains but it's going to be<br>a long-term effort to actually get<br>trains back in<br>to the situation we were in the past so<br>we need the train the buses to<br>complement the train network<br>if you look at say new south wales they<br>have an integrated network<br>if you go out to somewhere like broken<br>hill you go on the train to dubbo<br>and then you catch a bus and every stop<br>along the way there's a bus waiting to<br>take people out to the rural areas<br>but even with a good train service we're<br>going to have to have<br>buses or coaches to service the low<br>density spurs<br>to link the stations on the fast um on<br>the fast lines because we don't want the<br>train stopping too often<br>and there's big areas of new zealand<br>where um<br>rail is unlikely to to be built in any<br>anytime future one of my big issues of<br>traveling on the buses is that the off<br>coach infrastructure in many towns<br>and cities is extremely poor<br>and this includes the the downtown bus<br>depot<br>the most used bus depot probably in new<br>zealand<br>at um sky city in auckland for example<br>when the photo is of the men's toilets<br>the toilets are frightening to go into<br>you think you might get mugged<br>they they have um they're hopeless for<br>parents<br>they don't have showers they don't have<br>drinking waters and such like<br>and taupo is also the same there are<br>some<br>good examples in new zealand hamilton is<br>an excellent example<br>franz joseph is an excellent example and<br>that came about through funding from the<br>provincial<br>growth fund but one of the problems why<br>we also need the good of bus and<br>structure infrastructure is that<br>most of our coaches don't have toilets<br>on buses<br>and we're really unusual in that you can<br>look at just about any country in the<br>world<br>norway britain australia<br>the united states even the greyhound<br>buses they have<br>all have onboard toilets and it's just<br>an oddity that we don't<br>strangely enough intercity has just um<br>announced a service yesterday<br>that's going to go from palmerston north<br>to wellington<br>it's targeting it the the flying market<br>taking people down to wellington airport<br>and they are going to have an on on bus<br>toilet so<br>they realize that flyers want on bus<br>toilets<br>um so they need to to do it for the<br>others<br>the other issue that's i find really<br>shocking is that facilities for um<br>disabled people<br>are really poor um you can see on the<br>the screen there's a<br>example of a bus in australia where you<br>can put wheelchairs onto buses<br>in all the greyhound buses in australia<br>in america<br>you can do that but we also have the odd<br>situation in new zealand that<br>bus drivers are not allowed to help<br>people on and off buses<br>and if if anybody travels on buses often<br>you'll find that<br>the steps are really steep especially<br>the double deckers<br>and i've been on buses where the bus<br>driver says i can't help you on and<br>passengers have had to get off to help<br>an elderly person<br>now in north america again on greyhound<br>buses<br>the bus drivers are allowed to help<br>disabled people on and off<br>also on the slide is a picture of the<br>the toilets in the bus stop<br>in taupo now this is an important<br>interchange for buses<br>and it's an important comfort stop for<br>buses<br>you can see in the very distance in the<br>photo is a double decker bus<br>and you can see the award-winning<br>toilets with their lovely painting on<br>the side<br>but it's a it's a 150 meter walk 300<br>meter walk um to go from the top the bus<br>to the toilets<br>and so you know often it's raining it<br>can be snowing in taupo<br>and when you get there they're very<br>tired toilets there's there's no<br>communal<br>things for families no changing tables<br>no drinking water<br>it's it's it's a really poor situation<br>the other issue where we really fall<br>behind europe is that we<br>can't take bikes on most buses<br>occasionally you can if you book ahead<br>and you get the right bus and you get<br>the right bus driver<br>they'll allow you to do it but in<br>europe the the flex buses<br>they most of them can carry bikes and<br>it's not just for getting around to<br>um the the the great biking tracks that<br>we've got around new zealand but<br>people often want to take their bikes as<br>the final mile<br>so to get to the bus stop and to get off<br>the bus stop<br>so it's a really simple thing to do<br>but we don't do it as yet in new zealand<br>there's also the issue of who does pay<br>for the off-bus infrastructure<br>and i've just submitted to the taupo<br>council's<br>sustainable transport plan whoops just<br>gone backwards sorry<br>um and and basically taupo<br>taupo says that they're not going to<br>provide a good infrastructure for the<br>buses<br>because um the the bus passengers and<br>the bus companies are not going to pay<br>for it<br>now they've just got a grant from the<br>provincial growth fund which is just<br>finished of course<br>and from their ratepayers to upgrade<br>their airports so they're quite happy to<br>use taxpay and rate payer money to<br>upgrade airports but they're not willing<br>to do it for their um<br>for their bus travelers so so how do we<br>bring about<br>improvements theoretically competition<br>would work<br>but we've seen companies come and go um<br>naked bus went bought by mana now mana<br>bus closed<br>mana bus did bring in toilets<br>intercity is the dominant force in new<br>zealand so competition is probably not<br>going to work<br>this could be regulation there could be<br>subsidies there could be<br>renationalization<br>in terms of regulation i think that's<br>the first thing that we need to do<br>for example in australia the regulations<br>are that you cannot operate a long<br>distance coach<br>without onboard toilets and i think that<br>would be something that we could<br>we could really do in new zealand i've<br>i've written to a range of politicians<br>about this<br>um suggesting that that should be um<br>brought into<br>um government policy as yet i haven't<br>actually<br>received any replies to those letters so<br>it's it's a bit of a<br>bit of a problem um campaigning so<br>i'll leave it there um but i'm sure<br>heidi can<br>fill in some other details about the<br>network aspects of<br>buses paul thank you very much that was<br>really excellent and these<br>uh simple but very practical and<br>important<br>issues that you've raised like toilets<br>um you know really really do resonate i<br>have a relative who<br>who uh finds it difficult to travel long<br>distance by bus<br>because she has a weak bladder and as<br>you say there aren't toilets so<br>these things matter and and thank you<br>that was excellent um<br>robert we're in your hands now we're<br>tuning i think from land to air<br>uh the future of aviation so please if<br>you'd like to share<br>your screen and move on that would be<br>great<br>let's see how we go here<br>can you see my screen yes that's<br>excellent okay very good thanks<br>everybody uh<br>uh and thank you paul callister for<br>taking the initiative to organize this<br>paul and i have been looking at this<br>issue of aviation emissions for some<br>time<br>and some of our past work on this is<br>collected on this website<br>planetary ecology if you're interested<br>in taking that further<br>uh here's a map of airports in new<br>zealand this is actually well out of<br>date this is from 2006.<br>it's from the heyday of uh aviation in<br>some sense in new zealand<br>because in those days there were<br>international flights from also from<br>dunedin<br>palmerston north and hamilton live in<br>palmerston north in 2006 you could fly<br>to<br>five different international<br>destinations directly from palmerston<br>north it was<br>kind of ridiculous so we have a lot of<br>airports in new zealand are still<br>serving 20 of them<br>it's a very large market uh 20 million<br>domestic passengers a year<br>i don't know how many bus passengers<br>there are but i would<br>think not that many and of course if<br>you're lucky if you're on a major route<br>and you're booking ahead you can get<br>that's the backdrop um but of course<br>that is<br>that's not lower mission in terms of<br>regional<br>public transport um fifty percent of the<br>country live in auckland wellington in<br>christchurch<br>and that was still more or less the case<br>forty years ago in 1980<br>so there may have been a rural decline<br>but it hasn't really been a regional<br>decline because a lot of the regional<br>cities<br>have also been growing rapidly in that<br>period<br>so you'd either say half of us live in<br>auckland wellington and christchurch and<br>half don't<br>uh you could say that half of us live in<br>uh auckland wycattle and bay of plenty<br>that's also 50 of the population in that<br>little circle there<br>or you can say the 60 of the population<br>live on the<br>main track line between auckland and<br>wellington<br>so even though it's a sparsely populated<br>country and on average um<br>there's certainly regions where regional<br>uh<br>transporters uh there's reasonably high<br>density<br>uh before i go on to the aviation i just<br>put in a plea for this little region<br>here i live in palmerston north<br>and this corridor from palmerston north<br>to wellington is<br>likely to undergo significant growth and<br>as far as i know no one is looking as<br>that as a single region<br>it doesn't really make sense to have 150<br>strip development along 150 kilometer<br>stretch with the<br>kind of populations we're talking about<br>but that's exactly what is<br>about to happen so what's the problem<br>with the current<br>setting well there's a million tons a<br>year of co2<br>and nobody is looking at that there is<br>no plan to cut emissions from domestic<br>aviation<br>and as we heard from james earlier all<br>of that has to stop<br>so at the moment it's not even on the<br>radar and all the discussion<br>of various issues related to aviation<br>you can go back through a paper trail<br>going back<br>for decades essentially none of that is<br>looking at emissions it doesn't have to<br>be that way<br>the uk of course has a very well<br>developed rail and bus network and they<br>have just one seventh the<br>per capita domestic aviation emissions<br>and it's been going down in recent years<br>as basically fewer flights are available<br>what's also wrong with that the current<br>system is it's not really sustainable<br>even financially a lot of the passengers<br>were international tourists we don't<br>know what's going to happen there<br>a lot of them were business travel<br>people doing day trips<br>for work that may not continue to quite<br>the same degree in the future<br>and of course if there is less travel<br>air travel in the future that would tend<br>to raise costs<br>as paul mentioned the regional airports<br>they're pretty marginal financially and<br>this is<br>this is the main issue that's been<br>discussed in the media over the past<br>decade as they're basically desperate<br>for more subsidies<br>uh they were rebuffed for quite a while<br>but then they they<br>had more luck with the provincial growth<br>fund and they're more likely to shove<br>already fund the most alarming one here<br>is<br>uh masters in the airport got 10 million<br>dollars from the shovel already fund to<br>expand their airport<br>they don't have commercial air service<br>from from masters and airport<br>and the council never discussed this<br>application to the shuttle ready fund<br>no one knows actually what they're<br>planning to do with that with that<br>airport<br>there's a complex mixture of ownership<br>and this gives the councils<br>uh generally have an incentive to try<br>and promote growth from their local<br>airport<br>so on the 11th of march just before we<br>locked down hamilton<br>city council wrote to hamilton airport<br>asking them to<br>aggressively pursue international<br>so there has been some shrinkage of the<br>network i'm in parmesan nelson and<br>parmesan hamilton have been cancelled<br>and then origen came and picked them up<br>but it's not really the same service<br>it's 400 return<br>and there's much uh fewer seats<br>available it's really aiming at a<br>different market to what used to exist<br>and these little short flights that they<br>have just closed recently and<br>i'd be very surprised if they come back<br>um<br>into the present way things work<br>there's also a local debate about the<br>capital airport which is scheduled for<br>closure and some of the locals including<br>the council<br>another for another way in which the<br>regional airports get a subsidy is<br>through the airways corporation<br>who are state-owned and they provide the<br>air traffic control services<br>and they are withdrawing from from six<br>of the smaller<br>commercial airports i mean they operate<br>commercial flights but<br>they're non-commercial in the sense that<br>they're subsidised by airways<br>corporation<br>um and this has the fact that the whole<br>the air and the<br>train and the bus system isn't<br>integrated that is a problem<br>and that encourages people to drive to<br>the airport and park rather than using<br>public transport to get to the airport<br>paul mentioned there is a narrow<br>very fancy bus connecting to the farmers<br>north airport and to the wellington<br>airport<br>so the main thing that has to happen<br>here is just to get aviation emissions<br>onto the radar so that somebody is<br>looking at it and dealing with it<br>there's an interesting legal question<br>here which i'm not i'm not a lawyer but<br>i'm throwing this out there<br>currently airports don't have to account<br>for their scope 3 emissions which would<br>be the<br>emissions from the aircraft using their<br>facility<br>so what happens when you apply for<br>resource consent to build a new airport<br>like the<br>proposed airport in terrace in central<br>otago<br>their claim they claim that the<br>emissions of the aircraft that would use<br>the airport are not<br>part of their responsibility but<br>under the rma which itself is going to<br>be<br>replaced you do have to account for all<br>the cumulative<br>downstream effects of the new activity<br>that you're doing<br>so it's a question in my mind whether<br>that would in fact include the emissions<br>of the<br>uh what are the other alternatives well<br>here's a little electric plane of course<br>that looks rather nice<br>a little two-seater electric plane<br>flying over the swiss<br>alps it's actually got uh uses less<br>energy than in the sand leaf to<br>of course go much go much faster it<br>looks pretty nice<br>and there is now a two-seater electric<br>plane in nelson that they're going to<br>offer<br>i'd be very surprised if there was any<br>significant electric aviation in new<br>zealand<br>in the next 10 years looking out further<br>it is a possibility<br>it is technically possible to fly a<br>medium-sized<br>electric plane from auckland to<br>wellington but that's that's so far off<br>the radar<br>in terms of what people are considering<br>now that it's uh almost can't really<br>take it into consideration and you've<br>just seen all the difficulties that<br>we're having decarbonizing land<br>transport which is much easier<br>this is far pitched so i would put this<br>in the camp of sort of<br>kick no utopianism people just basically<br>clutching at straws<br>or not that's putting it a bit harsh but<br>people pro looking to things that might<br>possibly happen in the future<br>rather than planning for actual steps<br>that will make a lower emission future<br>come about<br>uh the other possibility that paul and i<br>have been interested in<br>is you can in fact reduce emissions from<br>aviation<br>by producing fully synthetic aviation<br>fuel which is basically<br>kerosene and here we see it's just this<br>little bit here this is a plant in<br>norway<br>it's just a computer graphic the plant<br>doesn't exist yet but it's under<br>construction<br>and they will make synthetic kerosene<br>out of water by<br>electrolysis of water and the carbon<br>comes out<br>sucking co2 out of the air so this would<br>actually be technically<br>climate neutral it's quite a large plant<br>500 megawatts of electricity going in<br>it's expensive to build<br>and if you build something like that in<br>new zealand you'd uh you could eliminate<br>three quarters of the<br>co2 emissions from domestic aviation<br>so it's a technical solution which is<br>just starting to<br>come about you just need eye-wateringly<br>large amounts of renewable electricity<br>to make this happen robert just<br>one more minute that's all right yeah so<br>although this is a technical solution<br>you would need a major change in the<br>entire energy situation in new zealand<br>for anything like this to happen<br>so what should we do obviously aviation<br>emissions is a difficult sector<br>we should stop subsidizing it and we<br>should try and integrate the<br>overall planning of aviation together<br>with um<br>with bus and rail and other systems we<br>should connect the networks up together<br>so that<br>the regional bus and train systems<br>connect to the airports<br>looking out longer term the main trunk<br>line passes very close to the palmerston<br>north and to the hamilton airports<br>it's literally just two or three hundred<br>meters away<br>um that would be something to look at<br>for the for the future<br>of course there is the fly less movement<br>as there is greater awareness of<br>climate change the fly less movement has<br>grown deidre kent and paul callister<br>starter<br>facebook group fly less kiwis it's been<br>popular<br>however this is very difficult for some<br>people<br>when you're faced with you know when you<br>want to see your uh<br>your elderly relative in auckland and<br>you live in wellington and you've got a<br>29<br>fare on the table uh it's going to be<br>pretty tempting<br>i guess all we can do at this point is<br>just continue to work to try to get<br>lower aviation emissions onto the radar<br>so that it becomes<br>part of our planning<br>thank you robert thank you very much a<br>really important topic area<br>as you indicate uh frequently totally<br>ignored by<br>policy makers and the public um but uh<br>but critical uh i'm just to say<br>personally uh just while heidi's getting<br>organized uh we have deliberately<br>brought a long-range<br>ev or navy with a long range so that we<br>can<br>travel by land rather than fly since all<br>our relatives are<br>scattered across the country typically<br>at least<br>three or four hundred kilometers from<br>wellington heidi<br>you might need to unmute if you are<br>muted heidi<br>heidi you're muted you just need to<br>unmute<br>heidi<br>right<br>uh except i've lost it just demo<br>well just while you're um finding that<br>heidi just to say<br>i think we've had some fantastic um<br>points made by the previous speakers and<br>it's been great to see the<br>chat discussion going on those who've<br>been presenting you might just like to<br>have a look at the chat<br>uh sections that you may have missed<br>while you were making your presentations<br>and heidi you need to go to the audience<br>that's it right off you go<br>um it's not right for me yet sorry<br>that's is that still okay with you<br>or has that changed that's changed no we<br>can you just talk to what's on our<br>screen<br>no you've got to start your meeting your<br>thing probably go back to this<br>escape<br>no so just while heidi's getting<br>organized as soon as height is finished<br>um like the opportunity for discussion<br>and um<br>are really be just led by what people<br>want to discuss<br>is obviously a wide range of issues and<br>some of them<br>are very much at the policy end of the<br>spectrum<br>both about so regulatory matters<br>subsidization matters<br>and so on some of them are more<br>technical<br>some of them relate to the whole system<br>design<br>and and how we ensure we have integrated<br>approaches<br>to uh this challenge of reducing<br>emissions<br>uh there's obviously you know lots and<br>lots of very specific<br>matters from the question of you know<br>toilets on buses<br>um through to ensuring that we we<br>properly integrate bus rail and air<br>arrangements how are you going heidi<br>does that work yet it looks fine at the<br>moment great<br>sorry about that everybody um and i have<br>a lot to say<br>too so talking pretty quickly<br>um i will if we apply some kiwi<br>compassion and<br>are willing to challenge a few standard<br>practices we have the potential to<br>create a transport system that enables<br>new zealanders<br>to flourish let's aim not just for lower<br>emissions but for nicer lifestyles<br>more opportunities thriving businesses<br>and a healthy environment<br>we've heard today about planes and<br>trains and coaches<br>trains and coaches are two elements i<br>think in a lower missions national<br>public transport network<br>they complement and maximize ridership<br>for each other<br>in a network built around passengers<br>needs<br>ideally long journeys can be taken<br>mainly by train<br>because they're smoother and more<br>comfortable with the ability to get up<br>and walk around<br>and they should be fast but coaches<br>provide coverage<br>extending the network to more places and<br>in terms of long-term planning the<br>flexibility of coaches is useful<br>coach routes can be changed once new<br>rail lines are added<br>i'm going to talk about the other<br>elements and why this should be<br>public funding for establishing and<br>maintaining this network<br>even if the services themselves are<br>privately run<br>first up bus stops<br>depots and stations are network elements<br>this is the ruacarca bus stop a good<br>example of why we need regulation to<br>allow the network to function<br>there are vans shuttles and taxis that<br>fill the gaps where timetabled services<br>don't exist<br>or where the services are hopeless for<br>people with disabilities or health<br>issues<br>many are driven by volunteers a full<br>network should ease that burden on these<br>volunteers but<br>the network will probably still need<br>smaller vehicles in the most remote<br>areas<br>some of these services simply highlight<br>the lack of a network for other users<br>who don't qualify for the service<br>and a critical part of the network often<br>overlooked is safe walking and biking<br>infrastructure<br>if passengers can't get to the station<br>safely they can't use the service<br>so what else is needed operations need<br>to be coordinated so that the services<br>function together i think there was a<br>comment on<br>on the chat about that and there needs<br>to be a single combined booking<br>information and communication system<br>using both digital platforms and<br>traditional ones<br>and finally we need a robust and<br>intuitive wayfinding system in each town<br>in the same way that drivers are<br>provided with signage<br>we'll know it's a network when it<br>doesn't take three days to get from<br>auckland to the hokianga<br>or when a delayed train doesn't mean<br>your ongoing coach ticket is forfeited<br>the entire network the vehicles the<br>built environment and the systems need<br>to be accessible for people with<br>different needs<br>we need this network for people the<br>economy<br>and the environment first people<br>more than a quarter of new zealanders<br>don't have driving licenses<br>and the number of people who can't drive<br>is going to increase<br>firstly because our population is aging<br>as you can see<br>elderly people will be a significant<br>part of the population in many regions<br>by 2033<br>but decision makers in auckland and<br>wellington where the populations are the<br>youngest<br>are the least likely to be aware of this<br>remaining fit<br>and socially connected is important to<br>our health as we age<br>the ability to walk to a bus stop and<br>then to bus to a walkable town<br>helps enormous enormously with this and<br>we cannot continue to help<br>uh to to rely on volunteer drivers<br>as the ratio of older people to younger<br>drivers<br>increases this volunteering will become<br>an onerous<br>secondly fewer city dwellers will be<br>drivers our cities<br>need massive mode shift and driving will<br>become optional for<br>more and more people plenty will choose<br>not to drive<br>or not to drive frequently enough to<br>feel confident on the open road<br>thirdly organizations adopting<br>sustainable transport policies will be<br>looking for public transport options<br>to reduce their staff members flying and<br>driving emissions<br>many people traveling between towns for<br>work prefer to arrive relaxed<br>rather than exhausted after<br>concentrating on driving<br>and of course children don't drive a<br>child<br>might simply want to go by coach to keep<br>in contact with both her parents<br>who now live in different towns but we<br>should be providing independent mobility<br>so kids can pursue interests<br>too one problem is the intercity<br>won't take unaccompanied children if<br>their journey involves a transfer<br>we can actually fix this we can make<br>travel safe for independent children<br>and regulate to ensure they are not<br>excluded<br>youth in regional areas need public<br>transport too<br>they often can't afford to buy or<br>maintain a safe car<br>and few regional towns provide driver<br>licence testing so<br>getting a license can end up an enormous<br>hassle<br>young adults may want to be able to take<br>up employment or training opportunities<br>that come up in nearby towns<br>or to engage in sports games and<br>cultural activities<br>forced to rely on workmates or teammates<br>who may be<br>inexperienced drivers and have older<br>less safe cars<br>leads too often to a tragic loss of<br>young life<br>a national public transport network will<br>allow all these people to flourish<br>where today's system does not<br>the second reason for establishing a low<br>emissions national public transport<br>network<br>is the economy wakakotahi research shows<br>that when a lack of access to transport<br>in rural areas means people cannot get<br>to goods<br>services and activities it leads to an<br>observable spiral of depopulation and<br>further loss of opportunities<br>rather than our regional towns being too<br>small to justify investment and better<br>transport choices<br>the lack of transport investment has<br>been a constant dampener on local<br>regeneration of our regional towns is<br>something we should plan as part of the<br>shift<br>from a linear economy to a circular<br>sustainable economy<br>the different model requires different<br>transport planning<br>green low carbon businesses involve<br>material reclamation<br>loops that turn one person's waste into<br>someone else's raw resource<br>every business is different but these<br>often involve<br>smaller more frequent transport<br>movements green businesses can also be<br>more reliant on local labour<br>therefore transport planning for<br>developing a healthy regional economy<br>needs to prioritize trips for people and<br>for people with small amounts of cargo<br>and uk research shows that rural areas<br>in particular offer huge<br>emissions reduction potential<br>via e-bikes and e-cargo bikes their<br>analysis has shown they can cut their<br>transport emissions by<br>50 through e-bikes and e-cargo bikes and<br>it's mainly in the rural areas<br>the last thing these modes need is<br>transport planning to suit a linear<br>economy<br>prioritizing large trucks barreling<br>along at unsafe speeds<br>we need to get as much freight as we can<br>onto rail<br>and lower the speed limits on the roads<br>in terms of sustainable domestic tourism<br>the same issues hold<br>we have gorgeous geography but a lack of<br>public transport to small towns and an<br>inability to walk or cycle safely within<br>and around the towns<br>is a major repellent to holidaying there<br>relaxing without having to drive<br>is a good reason why people who can<br>afford it fly overseas to walkable<br>places for holidays<br>is a swiss carriage half of which is<br>equipped to take bikes or skis<br>we can do this too and rental or share<br>bike schemes can also meet the needs of<br>tourists<br>a common theme here is the need for safe<br>walking and biking infrastructure<br>it's needed as part of the network and<br>it's needed for everyone<br>locals visitors children the elderly<br>and businesses no one should have to<br>walk or cycle on a road like this<br>whether they're on holiday and wanting<br>to see the countryside<br>meeting a bus or going to school or work<br>this spot is less than 4.8 kilometers<br>from a high school<br>incidentally so children living here<br>would be considered<br>as within walking distance by the<br>ministry of education<br>and they wouldn't qualify for a um<br>for a bus service<br>we need programs to improve safety for<br>children walking and biking<br>throughout the whole country our safety<br>statistics are valid reasons for anyone<br>to want to go by bus or train<br>and not have to drive but they are even<br>more valid<br>reasons to not want to walk to the bus<br>stop<br>the third reason for a low emissions<br>national public transport network is the<br>environment<br>for starters we have enough roads<br>coaches and trains don't require roading<br>expansion and don't cause the<br>destruction to soil biodiversity and<br>waterways<br>that road building causes<br>secondly if people will switch from<br>driving to public transport<br>our land transport emissions will drop<br>but that<br>is just the tip of the iceberg of the<br>environmental impacts of driving<br>here's the rest of the iceberg and if we<br>manage to normalize domestic tourism by<br>having reliable public transport<br>that also cuts our aviation emissions<br>given all these benefits an equally<br>important question to ask is<br>why don't we already have such a network<br>to answer this as always you need to<br>look at the budget<br>funding is usually allocated via the gps<br>activity classes<br>we don't have an activity class for a<br>national public transport network<br>we don't have an activity class for<br>inter-regional coach travel<br>there are public transport activity<br>classes but they aren't<br>intended for inter-regional travel and<br>there is a new<br>rail network activity class but it only<br>covers maintenance and renewals<br>not upgrades the walking and cycling<br>activity class<br>is still severely underfunded a fraction<br>of the amount recommended by the un who<br>say at least 20 percent of our transport<br>budgets<br>is needed we can only imagine the ease<br>of movement by foot and bike<br>we would have today had we built to make<br>sure drivers<br>paid for the facilities to keep people<br>safe<br>from motor vehicles as is their duty<br>in summary some activity classes are<br>missing<br>and others are not matched with funds<br>appropriate for the job<br>and that's because what we have been<br>investing in<br>is transport emissions i know new<br>zealanders<br>care about our children's future but<br>somehow<br>we've just lost our way why is this<br>i suppose if you're not somebody who<br>sometimes travels<br>with a goat it wouldn't occur to you to<br>design for someone<br>who sometimes travels with a goat we<br>don't need to design for people<br>traveling with goats i think<br>but what needs to change so we do start<br>designing for all our people<br>do we really have to fight for or<br>against each project<br>with evidence one of the problems we<br>face is a lack of data because without<br>funding from an activity class the data<br>is not being collected<br>for example the public transport<br>ridership<br>kept by wakakotahi doesn't include<br>ridership<br>on the scenic rail or the intercity<br>coaches let alone the many smaller<br>operators<br>that makes mode neutral analysis<br>impossible<br>there's no database of regional bus<br>stops waka kotahi don't know how many<br>bus stops there are<br>where they're located who owns the land<br>who maintains them<br>or how much money is spent on their<br>maintenance<br>there is no database about safety<br>associated with long-distance public<br>transport<br>we know coaches and trains are very safe<br>modes<br>but we can't intelligently regulate<br>vehicle design<br>because we have no local database about<br>passenger or driver<br>injury rates whether it's from traffic<br>trauma<br>passengers falling down steps personal<br>safety<br>or from drivers hurting their backs<br>handling luggage<br>how do we know whether investing in<br>public transport can offer better value<br>for money than making<br>changes to the road if the safety<br>benefits<br>of public transport are not evaluated<br>it would be nice to see a multi-criteria<br>analysis including important social<br>benefits too<br>like how children are stunted in their<br>development<br>through a lack of independent mobility<br>how transport independence<br>reduces youth depression and suicide<br>how elderly people are afraid of falling<br>and need to be provided with walkable<br>places<br>in order to remain confident enough to<br>go out<br>when waka kotahi provided advice to the<br>provincial growth fund on transport<br>investment for regional development<br>given what we know about data<br>availability can you tell me<br>how a mode neutral analysis to inform<br>that advice<br>was possible and when a decision is made<br>to invest in a row do you think they<br>compared the benefits<br>for investing that money instead on<br>improving public and active transport<br>including all the benefits for our<br>people economy and environment<br>people's reckons are actually the reason<br>for the direction we've taken<br>so what do we do now we have<br>ill-conceived<br>sprawl-supporting roads being designed<br>and built all around the country<br>we are subsidizing the most polluting<br>form of transport of all<br>aviation this is fundamentally<br>inconsistent with our climate and<br>wellbeing goals<br>we need that funding retrieved<br>declaring a climate emergency is<br>meaningless without actually<br>changing direction we need to become<br>more confident<br>in managing change we're capable of<br>u-turns on<br>transport decisions and major shifts in<br>practice<br>so let's discuss now what we can do<br>thank you well thank you very much<br>indeed<br>uh heidi perhaps just leave that um<br>slide there just for a f<br>for a minute so people can uh have a<br>look um<br>thank you to all the presenters you've<br>covered a<br>terrific range of material<br>some of it very focused on on transport<br>and particularly public transport but<br>some of it highlighting the need for an<br>integrated<br>approach to planning which um<br>views transport in its wider economic<br>social environmental context<br>and which highlights the importance of<br>systems<br>and and interdependencies and and also<br>some actually very simple things like<br>toilets on buses and so on<br>so um we've now got about 45 minutes or<br>so for discussion<br>um uh i'd<br>ask people if you would like just to put<br>to use the hand function<br>um to uh indicate you'd like to comment<br>or you can<br>wave your hand and<br>we'll simply proceed as best we can<br>through a series of issues um and i<br>might just take the opportunity<br>depending on the nature of the topic to<br>to seek views from a range of the of<br>of the panel members again depending on<br>the<br>particular issue so<br>uh who who would like to<br>i um ralph<br>rafe rather sorry yes please if you're<br>just unmute yourself<br>yeah thanks jonathan um so uh<br>a key theme that came out of that i<br>thought was um<br>lots of great themes of course but a key<br>theme was around funding<br>and um you know how the um<br>government policy statement well the<br>yeah the funding system the national<br>land transport fund and<br>um and so on are allocated and how we<br>should be shifting that<br>um i've long thought that that was a<br>um<br>a fund that's pretty hard to scrutinize<br>um<br>it's it's really hard to extract the you<br>know from the<br>published reports a good sense of you<br>know what's been put into public<br>transport and<br>and other modes of course um and<br>um partly because of the stupid<br>arrangements of funding<br>um you know through treasury grants and<br>so on for for rail<br>um but just you know leaving aside the<br>technical difficulties of access and<br>understanding<br>um there seems to be a critical um<br>problem there and and understanding the<br>strategic implications of the funding<br>envelopes and how they're growing or<br>shrinking<br>and and so on um and that needs to be a<br>lot more transparent<br>um and and of course you know there<br>needs to be a substantive<br>reallocation towards public transport um<br>you know i i i would have thought um a<br>very clear ministry of transport<br>directional statement around that would<br>thank you thank you ralph i mean in in<br>terms of the funding issues there's also<br>the the wider questions of implicit<br>subsidies<br>uh and explicit subsidies and and a<br>failure to price<br>uh emissions effectively and so on all<br>of which affect the incentive structure<br>in which decisions are being made by<br>organizations businesses and individuals<br>etc<br>who of this of the speakers would like<br>just to comment on what<br>rafe has said if any one you're most<br>welcome<br>i know ben has had to go but um<br>paul robert yeah if i can<br>so it's paul if i can sort of say<br>something<br>i mean we see this yeah we see this very<br>much at the local level of the<br>complications around funding<br>i mean i use the example of the taupo<br>interchange<br>and i went and talked to the teleport<br>council about this<br>um and also talked to intercity about it<br>and they're all passing the back and i<br>can sort of see why so the taupo council<br>says<br>are you know a significant number of the<br>passengers coming through<br>are not stopping in taupo i mean they<br>might be buying goods and services<br>on the stop so we don't want to pay for<br>it<br>intercity doesn't want to pay for it<br>because those private companies will try<br>and push the cost<br>you know naturally to someone else and<br>the government<br>won't pay for it because it simply<br>doesn't know about it<br>um you know it just doesn't have the<br>information so<br>you have and what you see is where it<br>works really well<br>is it works well through a push through<br>tourism for example the franz joseph<br>little bus interchange which is opposite<br>the cafes<br>now that came through a tourism fund so<br>where people see<br>the direct thing they can go to a<br>specific fund but it it just<br>it it's like fighting for um crossings<br>for<br>for cycle tracks you end up fighting<br>each individual case um so that's why we<br>need the overall<br>network to say look you know these are<br>these are things that we need to do in<br>each town each city<br>um yeah so all i've got to say<br>well thank you paul robert can i can i<br>throw that one back on you rafe because<br>this question about<br>urban form was raised earlier uh<br>there's an example in my mind where<br>they're proposing to build four and a<br>half thousand houses in levin<br>and of course the motorway the houses<br>are actually going to be on the other<br>side of the motorway which hasn't even<br>been consented yet but of course it's<br>likely to be built<br>and this will lead to a lot more car<br>traffic<br>out of the region so they're consulting<br>with the locals and live in about this<br>new project but<br>the impacts will be felt far outside<br>their region<br>what's a model where transport decisions<br>and<br>urban decisions can be joined up in some<br>way<br>right do you want to comment um yeah i<br>mean that's<br>you know there's been quite a lot of lip<br>service to the integration of<br>transport and urban form or urban<br>planning if you like but<br>not a huge amount of it actually done<br>and um<br>i i did comment in one of um you know<br>the chat<br>things earlier um that there's a massive<br>i mean it's very good auckland blog i'm<br>not i think it was matt<br>lowry um did quite recently about the<br>massive expansion of of auckland in<br>various directions<br>sprawling away over lots of new land<br>and um you know of course um<br>when you plan more arterials and build<br>more<br>roading um and don't really<br>develop the public transport network<br>sufficiently to go with that you you've<br>set in stone<br>a pattern of urban development that's<br>very car dependent<br>and we see that regularly all over new<br>zealand<br>um especially in the tier one cities as<br>as<br>as they're described under the national<br>policy statement of urban development um<br>but the problem is that yeah we're<br>locking in<br>a pattern of carbon emissions um which<br>we're unlikely to be able to shift<br>within<br>the crucial period that james renwick<br>described<br>at the beginning and so um<br>you know we're sort of building the<br>wrong shape of<br>city i don't want to hijack this the<br>discussion on to this alone but<br>you know with with levin and with um all<br>these peripheral urban development<br>issues and<br>urban expansions um the crucial thing is<br>to have enough rails going to these<br>places<br>and you know really good quality and and<br>coach coach services as well<br>you know very accessible ones and and a<br>sort of coherence of planning around<br>that it seems to me<br>from the ministry of transport through<br>to<br>um you know hud the new ministry of<br>housing and urban development<br>those two working together waka kotahi<br>very much<br>linked into that and they are doing some<br>good thinking about urban development<br>um but it's quite um incipient you know<br>it hasn't been developed very much<br>um all those things working together<br>very<br>well and very effectively so you can get<br>a really good public transport network<br>in place<br>as the cities expand and develop<br>thanks rafe i i'll just make one brief<br>comment and then i'll go to<br>uh david lass and i'm not sure who david<br>larson is but we'll come to you shortly<br>but just<br>simply say having been on a road trip to<br>visit relatives in new plymouth auckland<br>hamilton and so on just over the last<br>few weeks uh<br>sort of with forced holiday from the<br>university um i'm just being very<br>conscious of the amount<br>of um urban sprawl that one sees in many<br>many uh small and and larger centers<br>across new zealand whether it's toppo or<br>hamilton or<br>new plymouth etc uh low density housing<br>um you know in many cases using valuable<br>land<br>that could be much more productively<br>used for agriculture and so on<br>anyway uh the challenge there is of<br>course partly nimbyism<br>with respect to urban density isn't it<br>and um<br>the the power of those who own<br>valuable inner city properties to stop<br>um increased density david<br>now david larson i'm off sure sorry who<br>you actually are but<br>you have your hand up so you're next and<br>then i'll go to darren davis<br>um i'm not even sure who david larson is<br>and i have no idea why it seriousness<br>david lasted on my thing<br>so my name's adam um<br>so i'm adam weller and um um i<br>this will be fantastic i question in<br>regards to<br>heidi's presentation around um because<br>often you get solutions<br>um what this if we can get a network in<br>place which is what heidi was referring<br>to<br>i was curious on who people think should<br>be running that should that be an nzta<br>running network i.e setting up making<br>sure that there's facilities for<br>um bus networks and someone throughout<br>the country or a nurse in the chat<br>someone's saying a new agency should be<br>created<br>to run the network per se um curiously<br>people think<br>um hey who should be responsible and and<br>if it's coming to mit<br>and how we get you know um the<br>administer to maybe look at how we can<br>progress that because it seems amazingly<br>easy<br>thing to do needs to be quickly but no<br>one's taking ownership<br>right so david there's a variety of<br>issues there which include integration<br>in relation to funding in relation to<br>digital<br>services uh in relation to just the<br>whole planning of the networks and so on<br>so heidi do you want to respond to that<br>um sure um i think<br>in the short term i would say it would<br>be an nzta thing<br>um because i think they need to set up a<br>a public transport activity class<br>for this um but this brings in the wider<br>question of<br>what nzta are good at and they are<br>really good at building roads<br>and i actually think they'd be better<br>off split off<br>uh with a new agency alongside which is<br>for all the sustainable<br>modes um and then the size of them can<br>be<br>adjusted according to the country's<br>direction it's going in<br>so there are a number of reasons<br>why it would be good to get sustainable<br>transport out of nzta<br>it's you know we're not in the situation<br>we're in now because<br>of just um<br>how do i put this there's the political<br>economy of car dependence and most<br>of that is a whole lot of people doing<br>what they do<br>which isn't particularly wise but it's<br>not particularly bad it's just people<br>doing what they do<br>shoveling this political economy of car<br>dependence forward all the time<br>supporting each other and then there are<br>a couple of<br>black spots where there is actually<br>um support for the fossil fuel<br>industries<br>and the automotive industry and i would<br>say that<br>traffic modeling and transport<br>investment<br>in evaluation is one of those places<br>where there's a bit of a<br>black spot so i think it'd be great to<br>get sustainable transport out of the<br>nzta for that reason<br>all right thank you heidi um james i<br>wonder if i could just<br>move to you just to ask you may or may<br>not be able<br>or willing to comment on this but to<br>what extent the climate change<br>commission<br>uh in its thinking about the need for<br>rapid decarbonization over the next<br>decade<br>has thought about some of the uh<br>integration issues if i can put it that<br>way that have been raised by many of the<br>speakers over the last<br>hour or so very good question jonathan<br>and i knew somebody was going to ask<br>that<br>um the short answer is yes<br>so things are being worked on still<br>obviously<br>but you know the clock's ticking the the<br>draft advice will be up for<br>public consultation on the first of<br>february so that's not too far away now<br>um and yeah transport's a big part of<br>the story for obvious reasons as<br>discussed today<br>and a lot of the ideas that we've heard<br>about today<br>uh in the mix you know that the actual<br>form of the recommendations that will<br>come from the commission<br>um yet to be decided to a certain extent<br>but yeah<br>obvious things like the pumping up the<br>public transport and integrating<br>transport systems and<br>electrifying the vehicle fleet all of<br>those things are<br>definitely going to be part of the story<br>yeah<br>all right thank you darren if i can come<br>to you now<br>um uh please go ahead<br>uh kia ora tattoo um really great set of<br>presentations so i really<br>really appreciated it so thanks to all<br>of the um<br>panelists so i think what you've come up<br>with<br>is i think in urban public transport<br>we've probably got better over the last<br>couple of decades particularly in the<br>largest new zealand cities<br>from what it would seem is that regional<br>and long distance public transport is<br>just another dog's breakfast<br>in this country not to put too fine a<br>point on it they're<br>completely down to you know regional<br>councils and<br>um you know what they might provide and<br>subs you know provide<br>subsidised within regions uh into<br>regional public transport at least<br>theoretically is not eligible for<br>you know funding out of the national<br>land transport fund which ends up with<br>you know odd situations of you know<br>buses from nelson to richmond running in<br>two regions or from<br>tokokuita to tuica or you know stuff<br>like that that you have to have these<br>bizarre arrangements<br>so completely kind of you know take that<br>point on board<br>and interested first any comments on<br>yeah how we get past that and you know<br>i know there's been some comments about<br>uh you know having some sort of national<br>coordinating<br>organization but there's a lot of work<br>to do on the ground the second one<br>and it kind of falls out of this is a<br>lot of<br>i work in a consultancy and i do a lot<br>of work on public transport planning<br>across the country<br>and if you put a an equity or a<br>deprivation<br>lens over the current provision of<br>public transport in new zealand you'll<br>find almost an inverse relationship<br>between<br>deprivation and public transport access<br>then that by that i mean that<br>the more affluent you are generally the<br>better public transport you get<br>and that deprived communities generally<br>often at the urban periphery get uh get<br>poorer<br>public transport and i presume that<br>would apply not just<br>you know within urban areas but across<br>the entire country so<br>how do we address that sort of divide<br>uh you know yeah we've got a situation<br>in new zealand of<br>fast growing cities medium growth cities<br>and<br>frankly places that are zombies uh you<br>know<br>towns that are really really in<br>communities that are really really<br>struggling and i really take the point<br>about<br>the role of public transport and<br>providing for both social inclusion but<br>also for<br>revitalization of those places so any<br>thoughts from anyone would be much<br>appreciated<br>thanks darren a number of important<br>issues there um<br>i just wanted thomas would you be<br>interested in coming to commenting on<br>that<br>um or any of the other speakers<br>um thanks jonathan maybe not<br>specifically on that but<br>i guess i'm listening and thinking that<br>often when we're thinking about what<br>what we want is<br>some kind of significant political<br>change right we have a<br>we have a setup in the country which<br>massively prioritizes roads<br>and individual car transport um and and<br>tracks for freight that's what we've got<br>in aviation right<br>so we want and in order to get from that<br>point to<br>the other points which we would like to<br>see we have to have some very<br>significant political change right so<br>so that's that's what we need we have a<br>political change problem i actually<br>don't think we have<br>particularly a let's work out the<br>detailed policy issues problem<br>because it's kind of that's kind of easy<br>i actually think<br>and ben you know<br>from the mot people were kind of dumping<br>on him in the comments but<br>frankly he's probably one of our biggest<br>allies in the public service<br>and in the ministry of transport he<br>would probably like to have a massive<br>rapid transition to to trains so<br>i kind of think it's for me<br>this might be an annoying thing to say<br>but the<br>the most important focus of energy for<br>all of us<br>probably is to get people to<br>make noise politically about whatever<br>the issue we want<br>might be for me i think a really good<br>pinch point<br>is going to be rail transition to rail<br>now look at housing right the government<br>has a massive mandate we've got the most<br>popular prime minister<br>ever in the world university ever and<br>she's not going to do anything about<br>housing really<br>she's going to say no i think it's good<br>that housing prices continue to go up<br>because most people think the house<br>house prices should continue to go up<br>she literally said that so<br>that is a political problem and if she<br>stood up tomorrow and said<br>uh actually we're gonna we're gonna<br>completely move away from motorways and<br>get everyone on trains<br>then their focus groups her focus groups<br>and her<br>targeted polling would explode and she<br>would not do it<br>so he if we want the train same as we<br>want housing changes<br>if we want trains we need to massively<br>organize<br>to ask for them to demand them and<br>otherwise all the brilliant policy ideas<br>just kind of mean nothing and i think<br>that we can do that<br>and i think there are some specific<br>areas that we can push on um and<br>organize around<br>uh to to get there but i guess that's<br>that's um<br>that's a challenge for all of us to work<br>out how we want to do that organizing<br>yes thomas can i say because you're<br>involved you know in local government as<br>an elected official um uh<br>while we need obviously public pressure<br>from individuals from public<br>sector organizations civil society<br>organizations and so on we also need you<br>folk<br>in the local government sector uh who<br>care about these matters to be organized<br>across<br>uh the local government sector as a<br>whole so that there is pressure coming<br>uh from a wide range of sources is not<br>that the case<br>oh totally and and in many councils<br>we're a million miles away from that<br>and many councils they're dominated by<br>people who uh<br>basically bitumen swelling road<br>uh enthusiasts and and so we're we're<br>we're not there you know in in the<br>wellington regional council<br>we've probably got a relatively<br>progressive majority i would say so most<br>things are going to be<br>good but then we've got a huge layer of<br>the public service in our council and<br>all other public service organizations<br>in the entire country<br>that is used to doing things in a<br>certain way in a kind of neoliberal<br>abstractive capitalist economy which<br>is run on roads and cars and and that's<br>quite difficult to shift you know i mean<br>it takes time and<br>you could you could have great<br>politicians who wanted to move but so<br>you know i'm not trying to pass the back<br>here we i have to do better we all have<br>to do better as elected officials oh one<br>thing i would say is<br>uh get progressive people who like<br>trains in public transport<br>to run for council yeah you know hardly<br>anyone runs for council<br>there are a significant number of<br>council seats in the country<br>that are elected unopposed yeah you know<br>people just turn up and<br>just get elected so good point let's<br>well let's get elected let's get people<br>on there and let's um<br>let's basically push for public<br>transport<br>yeah no no all good and and i'm rather<br>hoping that<br>when james's commission's report comes<br>out<br>in early february the stark reality of<br>the<br>of the carbon budgets that will be<br>evident will will<br>helpfully shock uh public opinion<br>somewhat and and help mobilize the kind<br>of<br>change we need now look i've got another<br>david last year what's the plan jonathan<br>yes yes just to reiterate so this thing<br>comes out for<br>public comment for six weeks from the<br>first of february<br>everybody needs to comment absolutely<br>because as<br>rod car said at a meeting recently we're<br>bound to have got it wrong<br>so we need to hear why it needs to be<br>changed and how<br>well i hope it's not too wrong james all<br>right now i've got another<br>day<br>i've got another david larson um who i<br>think is different from<br>uh adam uh so if you would like to<br>um unmute and ask a question and then<br>is there another david larsen<br>with a question with a hand up<br>no all right so we go to chris chris<br>mckellar<br>you can hear me yes please go ahead<br>yeah look let's just firstly about this<br>whole public transport situation we've<br>got some<br>um decommercialize the public transport<br>at the moment public transport is a<br>service<br>it should not be a commercial be run on<br>a commercial basis where regional<br>councils<br>have to start looking at fair box<br>returns<br>public transport has got to be<br>subsidized<br>and there are especially here within the<br>it's all about trying to save money it's<br>all about to<br>reduce services to save money because we<br>don't want to keep going to nzta<br>to get extra funding for public<br>transport<br>and this is the reason why i'm a really<br>really keen<br>advocate to get a national public<br>transport<br>agency established very similar to what<br>transport new south wales has done but<br>more so<br>using the public transport victoria's<br>model<br>the public my version of this of the new<br>zealand version would be<br>under ministry of transport a separate<br>state entity<br>and its sole role is to take over the<br>procurement<br>planning and funding of all public<br>transport across<br>all 16 regions within new zealand we've<br>got regions in new zealand that don't<br>have public transport<br>but ratepayers or<br>sorry taxpayers in those regions are<br>through<br>are actually funding public transport<br>for auckland wellington<br>what we need is to do standardise<br>because currently regionalized<br>funding doesn't work it's very very cost<br>the cost is high a lot of regional<br>councils don't have the budget and i<br>know here in waikato regional council i<br>know that auckland region count<br>auckland council has got similar issues<br>we've got the great williamson regional<br>council have got<br>funding issues but if we bring it back<br>under one state entity state governments<br>do<br>actually have a better bargaining power<br>when you're dealing with<br>and buses and<br>it to me it just doesn't it just doesn't<br>take a rocket science to figure this out<br>because you know to reintroduce regional<br>rail<br>into back into new zealand we're going<br>to have to convince kiwi rail kiwi rail<br>owns the track<br>current policy of kiwi rail is saying no<br>we want the track for our freight<br>services and now scenic trains<br>but who is going to say to kiwi roll<br>well hey listen<br>let's get regional trial trains back<br>again<br>who's going to say that if we had a<br>national public transport agency to say<br>yes this is what it says go to kiwi<br>royal and say<br>hey we want to use the track how much<br>are you going to cost<br>the government also needs to stop<br>treating kiwi rail as a money-making<br>machine<br>the the national track infrastructure<br>should be actually separated out like<br>they've done in victoria<br>where they've got vic rail and that<br>whole track infrastructure is<br>then separated once again being another<br>state entity<br>under the ministry of transport that is<br>an open access track that means<br>anybody who wants to run a train service<br>can actually<br>operate with on the national rail<br>network the national rail network is<br>grossly underutilized<br>um and you know<br>we keep talking about this but nothing<br>really really happens anyway that's<br>my personal views on that all right<br>chris well thank you there's actually<br>quite a few different points there<br>who would like to comment uh again<br>thomas or<br>heidi um robert yes<br>i definitely agree that the operation of<br>the track should be separated from<br>the operation of passenger rail i mean<br>kiwi rail is not really interested in<br>passenger rail and i can't see it being<br>interested in that really in the future<br>i think<br>i'm not sure about a national public<br>transport agency i'm not against it<br>it might take quite a while to set up<br>and one of the things that<br>you have is regional councils they might<br>get a bit like protective<br>of their turf you know for better or<br>worse i'm not saying i would but<br>so that might be that might be a little<br>tricky to actually get in place<br>i think i probably want to do some stuff<br>more quickly that you don't have to have<br>a massive restructure for but i think we<br>should<br>i think you're right that we should<br>think about the<br>the restructuring of passenger rail it's<br>very important thanks thomas anyone else<br>want to comment<br>down that yeah i would just add i'll be<br>very brief<br>everybody's talking about the the<br>carrots that would make everything<br>better but uh in other countries they<br>also use the stick<br>and that's a problem for new zealand and<br>that we're just<br>we just have no tradition of um using<br>disincentives like charges to<br>get people out of their cars if you look<br>at the current pricing regimes for<br>driving a private car in europe it's<br>just completely off the charts compared<br>to<br>you know things that would probably be<br>put in place in new zealand at the<br>moment<br>somehow we're basically making it very<br>difficult for ourselves so<br>somehow i think that should be included<br>as well<br>absolutely uh robert i think that's a<br>crucial crucial point in terms of the<br>incentive structure for individuals and<br>businesses and so on<br>um now look i've had one or two people<br>ask me how do you put your hand up<br>uh uh could could um<br>peter uh doubt and you're next can you<br>just tell<br>people how you put your hand up<br>um yes you can do it like this in front<br>if you click on participants at the<br>bottom of the you click on participants<br>that's right<br>so that's right thank you because i i've<br>forgotten<br>if i click on participants i don't need<br>to raise my hand<br>i can't all right peter go ahead or alex<br>i sort of like the idea of a national<br>public transport<br>service but then if<br>maybe that should be sort of a public<br>transport version of nzta<br>i'm a bit worried that if you make a<br>public transport version of<br>um if you make a completely nationalized<br>public transport network<br>all the places that currently have<br>really good public transport will end up<br>getting theirs kind of pushed down to<br>the average<br>and yeah it'll be great for westport and<br>and otaki but it might make<br>christchurches or hamilton's public<br>transport get worse so that would be a<br>bit of a worry<br>now i think that the places that have<br>the most wonderful public transport or<br>the all the most improving public<br>transport<br>um which in new zealand might be<br>auckland um<br>i mean famously in britain might be<br>london<br>it's something to do with the fact that<br>you can sack boris the mayor or you can<br>sack phil<br>off the mayor if you don't think the<br>transport is very good<br>in dunedin um people blame our local<br>mayor when the public transport is bad<br>but in fact<br>it's not the dunedin city council's<br>responsibility it's run by this<br>organization no one's ever heard of<br>called the otago regional council<br>and so to some extent i feel that if<br>most<br>reasons if most of the time people when<br>people get on a long distance coach<br>is to travel somewhere within their<br>region then maybe<br>regional councils should be the main<br>agency for promoting regional transport<br>such as<br>that operated by inner city and skip and<br>some of those other companies<br>um but um then i feel<br>well you know donating to christchurch<br>is a pretty big um transport market and<br>that is across two regions so<br>i i don't i don't have a really good<br>answer but um i do like to<br>mention to people whenever i get a<br>chance that um we used to have this<br>famous nationwide travel company called<br>intercity and<br>yes i hear you all say oh well we've<br>still got it but actually inner city<br>used to run trains in<br>buses it was what was called the<br>passenger<br>business group of the new zealand<br>railways corporation<br>but then they separated the transport<br>the trains off and called that<br>you know scenic journeys whatever it's<br>called this month they seem to change it<br>quite often<br>um and and then inner city coaches were<br>separated off as well um but um<br>i i to perhaps to do that better now<br>would be to set up a national<br>long-distance transport booking agency<br>that didn't actually attempt to sort of<br>take over all the services but maybe<br>just<br>ran a clearinghouse for booking tickets<br>on them um<br>like a bit like google transit you know<br>you might use something like google<br>maps to um um<br>plan a journey from my house in dunedin<br>to say<br>jonathan's house or or um or paul<br>callister's house<br>um and then you could just sort of click<br>something and it would take you to the<br>site where you could actually basically<br>do all of the ticketing in one go<br>and even if it was completing um coach<br>and bus and train services all the way<br>and then um just before i go um<br>i'd really love to see as i've been<br>hoping on in the comments<br>um or all afternoon all morning um i'd<br>really like to see<br>kiwi rail just simply fill up its seats<br>so<br>you know don't don't spend billions and<br>dollars on more trains just yet but how<br>about<br>just filling up with empty seats on your<br>existing trains in the same way that air<br>new zealand would never allow a plane to<br>fly half or even three quarters full<br>and we shouldn't we should have all our<br>trains running to capacity<br>and and um if you if you make 10 people<br>pay 108<br>and instead of that you have 100 people<br>paying 10.80 to travel on<br>on the door of the explorer then you'll<br>sell a lot more in the snack bar and you<br>make more money that's as simple as that<br>and yeah in new zealand would never<br>allow empty seats to that extent<br>that'll do all right well thank you<br>again a range of issues there some of<br>them about institutional design and the<br>pros and cons of different ways of<br>organizing things um<br>some specific issues about um<br>booking systems the digital integration<br>again uh heidi you commented on that<br>previously do you want to comment on<br>that now uh yes<br>i i agreed with everything you said<br>there and i don't think there's any need<br>to privatize operators<br>one of the posts that paul and i wrote<br>was about a history of long-distance<br>um buses in new zealand and<br>it really showed that in a place like<br>new zealand we've never<br>gone for a complete monopoly um<br>by uh by the state um<br>we've we've never you know you can<br>choose to go completely<br>uh state-owned or you can go completely<br>commercial and<br>um and and<br>there are pros and cons of both so i<br>don't think the first thing that we<br>should ever try to do is<br>is try and bring it all into one place<br>there's lots of low-hanging fruit we can<br>do<br>to help coordinate it and that's the<br>best thing to be doing now as you<br>talk i was also wanting to<br>suggest another really low hanging fruit<br>which is the overnight train<br>because that doesn't require the<br>upgraded track<br>so it's something we can do really<br>quickly and it<br>there are lots of different ways to um<br>lots of different markets for that and<br>it would bring ridership<br>up and uh cut a whole day of travel<br>for anyone who's spamming both country<br>both islands<br>which makes holidaying by train<br>uh in from auckland or the north island<br>down to the south island you know<br>practical um so i think that that's<br>something that we need to push as well<br>um and i just wanted to also<br>respond to what uh thomas said although<br>unfortunately<br>i think he's gone now um about the<br>public pressure because we've<br>been putting public pressure on for a<br>long time and<br>we are making gains at the moment um<br>but it's not going to be enough in for<br>the speed that we need to<br>move so there needs to be something else<br>to complement with the public pressure<br>uh yes everybody needs to do their part<br>but the the one missing thing<br>is actually the legal situation um and i<br>don't mean a whole lot of litigation<br>but what i do mean is people need to be<br>able to lay out quite clearly<br>to uh all the different layers of<br>government and all the different people<br>involved<br>what their legal obligations are<br>hopefully without<br>legal cases but it might take a few<br>legal cases<br>to make this really clear so that<br>because at the moment we've got<br>um councils and road controlling<br>authorities and so on<br>only listening to those vocal minority<br>voices<br>i think it's that those are the people<br>they<br>see themselves as or something it's a<br>legal conservatism<br>but if they were to see a threat of<br>action<br>for not uh taking steps on on<br>public health on climate on<br>uh equity and so on um<br>then they can start putting things into<br>a more balanced framework<br>okay so we need a better regulatory<br>framework uh stronger if you like legal<br>rights and responsibilities and the<br>public<br>yes and the public pressure needs to<br>include reference to this<br>yes sure now i'm conscious of time we've<br>got about five minutes before we need to<br>wrap up for 12 o'clock<br>um uh and we've had a pretty good<br>sort of feast of material so far uh<br>rainer you've got a question so<br>uh or a comment to make so we'll take<br>yours and then i<br>thought i'd just give the the<br>contributors an opportunity<br>to speak for now for now for a minute or<br>so if they wish<br>to kind of uh reinforce any particular<br>points they want to<br>or or address any matters that they feel<br>haven't received adequate attention<br>so um i know we've lost uh ben and i<br>think we've lost<br>um thomas but uh the other four<br>contributors are there<br>serena the floor is yours uh thanks<br>jonathan uh thank you for the<br>presentation<br>very very interesting to hear um<br>after this after listening to everybody<br>i mean<br>we can see we all determined that there<br>is a lot to do in new zealand<br>uh and we determined uh that<br>uh we require some political change now<br>i'm a pragmatic realist and<br>the fact is we are a car society sadly<br>and i think political change<br>requires populist movement and that<br>won't be the case<br>so my question really is what can be<br>done to facilitate<br>what we discussed today because<br>obviously<br>the key is our administration in<br>wellington we need to convince<br>some leaders because what this country<br>needs is leadership<br>uh not doing what the people want<br>because they want to drive cars i mean<br>that's effect<br>we need a leader who looks beyond that<br>and talking about<br>the legal framework like heidi talked<br>about it<br>who is determined to fulfill our paris<br>climate agreement<br>requirements uh because i mean that is a<br>legal framework too<br>too we we have to do a bit more than uh<br>not doing anything and build more roads<br>so my question is<br>what can really be done to to get all<br>this going what<br>what was mentioned today because i mean<br>that's that's the easy one to understand<br>the technology to understand that there<br>is a network requirement<br>all those things but i think the big<br>step is to get politicians on board and<br>uh the populism won't work we we need a<br>leadership<br>thank you all right reyna look thank you<br>um<br>who would like to respond to that um in<br>in the context of having a new minister<br>of transport<br>michael wood um who is uh<br>you know a thoughtful person but not<br>probably an expert in transport<br>thanks jonathan thanks for the question<br>rana<br>quite right uh i'm hopeful there is some<br>leadership emerging<br>in government and the zero carbon act<br>which has been enforced now for over a<br>year uh<br>sets the framework in new zealand for<br>action on climate change so when the<br>climate change commission's advice<br>is tabled next year the government is<br>required to respond and actually even<br>though the<br>advice will be a bit delayed they still<br>have to respond by the end of the year<br>next year and i know james shaw is keen<br>to<br>push on this it's a little bit hard to<br>tell exactly<br>you know what the mood of cabinet is in<br>general but<br>at this stage i'm i'm reasonably hopeful<br>that<br>we are going to see some action<br>happening but you know<br>i'm not in the inner circle politically<br>all right so a number of people have<br>emphasized the critical importance of<br>of politics in this context and<br>political economy and<br>and the fundamental question how do we<br>get political change<br>um can we just leave that there and can<br>i just the last couple of minutes just<br>say to the contributors uh the speakers<br>if you'd like just to offer a few brief<br>reflections<br>now to wrap things up uh here's the<br>opportunity<br>so uh paul heidi<br>uh james and<br>yeah i mean my my one thing i'd like to<br>see happen<br>in 2021 and it's a very small thing<br>but get a decent intercity bus depot in<br>auckland<br>we've been writing to people for about<br>five years about this<br>um it's it's doable and if we can't do<br>that<br>we we can't shift all the other things<br>so it's grand to talk about<br>um you know the the restructuring of<br>nzta and all those sort of things<br>but we've really got to do some small<br>practical things that would actually<br>help<br>so yeah that's my my big big plan for<br>2021<br>right well thank you paul i think you've<br>really highlighted you know the critical<br>importance of small steps<br>as well as the big design issues<br>so thank you for that robert i'll reply<br>to rayner's point<br>my impression is that james shaw and<br>jacinda ardern are pragmatic realists<br>and that the labour party probably did<br>go as far as they could go in the last<br>election<br>in terms of putting in a large number of<br>small things to cut emissions<br>and that they did actually risk a<br>backlash if they'd gone further<br>so as a realist uh yeah they do have to<br>be careful and once we've got those<br>things bedded in then we can do<br>something else<br>that's basically the only practical way<br>i can see<br>thanks robert and i guess realism means<br>you have to take<br>account of the political wind and part<br>of the challenge here is how do you<br>change the political wind<br>and i guess i hope the climate change<br>commission will be a<br>contributor to that and with that in<br>mind james did you have any<br>final comments and then i'll finish off<br>with heidi yeah<br>um thank you jonathan just quickly i'd<br>like to thank everybody i found this a<br>really interesting discussion i've<br>taken a lot of notes um and it's<br>it's heartening to know that yep the<br>discussions at the commission and what's<br>shaking up and the draft advice lines up<br>a lot of what's been said here<br>so yeah thanks everyone and um<br>hearing your comments on the<br>commission's work next year<br>thanks james thanks for all that you've<br>been doing too publicly and privately<br>in your various capacities so uh all the<br>best for the coming months<br>heidi uh well thank you everybody i've<br>really enjoyed this too<br>um i guess one last thought<br>is if everyone could remember not to<br>accept the myths being<br>stated without challenging them so<br>we don't have data available so that the<br>myths about<br>we're too sparse a country to have<br>public transport<br>can be easily challenged the myth that<br>everybody drives can be easily<br>challenged no<br>actually more than a quarter of us don't<br>and many more people don't want to<br>on the open road so that's<br>that's that's really my last<br>part parting thought um but i suppose<br>the other one<br>is that the climate commission has<br>looked at<br>uh the whole emission situation as from<br>a<br>from a long term view first end of<br>century emissions<br>what we need to do for that and then<br>work back from there<br>to decide what we can do now that's in<br>line with that that also helps with our<br>2030 emissions<br>and that i think is a really critical<br>thing to remember<br>we need to be setting up for the long<br>term that means<br>our cities and our towns must not sprawl<br>full stop what can we do now<br>to make sure that doesn't happen and<br>then we work out what the emissions<br>changes for 2030 from that<br>not the other way around yeah thanks<br>easier said than done heidi well look<br>thank you everybody<br>that's actually quite easy well<br>the political economy of this is the<br>challenge heidi um<br>yes so the technical side of it is<br>probably quite straightforward um<br>look uh first of all a big thank you to<br>paul for setting this up uh<br>paul has put a lot of work into uh<br>coordinating with the various<br>contributors<br>and uh organizing things so thank you<br>paul a really<br>important uh area of of of um<br>activity in relation to trying to<br>address this enormous challenge<br>of climate change um and transport<br>really from new zealand in terms of<br>carbon dioxide emissions is at the<br>center of that<br>that challenge so thank you very much<br>thank you to the other contributors<br>for your presentations and so forth<br>we're trying to make sure that they are<br>available<br>on the igps website uh the recording<br>will be available on the igps website in<br>due course<br>um thank you to all the people who have<br>asked questions<br>and who have contributed to the chat<br>session i know there's a wealth of<br>expertise<br>among uh the people who have zoomed in<br>today<br>uh and it's been great to see the very<br>thoughtful comments in the chat session<br>though i appreciate i haven't had a<br>chance to contribute<br>to that myself um lots and lots of<br>issues<br>ongoing um obviously the next few months<br>is going to be pretty critical<br>um as we await the the climate change<br>commission's uh<br>climate change budgets uh emission<br>budgets and the advice on how to achieve<br>those budgets<br>so uh i think we're all going to be<br>required to be fairly<br>uh active uh in the next of the while uh<br>even more so perhaps and<br>has been the case you're the two a<br>critical time for new zealand<br>so um thank you all uh just a sign of<br>kind of comment i don't think i've ever<br>seen so many david larsen's<br>um but i'll tell david that he's uh he's<br>how kind of<br>and with that thank you everyone again<br>and<br>let's hope we can continue this<br>discussion in some way uh over the<br>coming months<br>you</p></main><footer
