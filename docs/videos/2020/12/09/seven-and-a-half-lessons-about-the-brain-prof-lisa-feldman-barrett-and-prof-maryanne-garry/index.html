Along the way, they also discuss the state of the world from the perspective of psychological science, and answer some of the questions submitted previously by the university and wider communities.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i'm marianne gary i'm a professor here<br>at the university of waikato<br>in psychology and to the new zealand<br>institute for security and crime science<br>and today i'm delighted to sit down<br>again with professor lisa feldman<br>barrett to talk about her new book<br>and a lot more professor barrett is a<br>psychological scientist<br>a neuroscientist one of the world's most<br>respected scientists in the field<br>of human emotion her research has<br>radically changed the prevailing wisdom<br>about how the human brain and the body<br>work together to create emotions<br>she shows that our emotions are not<br>built into our brains from birth<br>nor are they triggered by outside forces<br>instead they're events that our brains<br>construct<br>they're shaped by our experiences our<br>language and our culture<br>professor barrett is a university<br>distinguished professor of psychology<br>at northeastern university and she has<br>appointments at harvard medical school<br>and massachusetts general hospital her<br>work in cognitive<br>social and affective neuroscience has<br>significant implications<br>for both everyday and high stakes<br>interactions<br>her books and her more than 200<br>peer-reviewed scientific papers<br>show the impact of her research on a<br>range of fields<br>she's also the immediate past president<br>of the association for psychological<br>scientists<br>which is the global organization of more<br>than 30 000 members<br>she's unsurprisingly won a fistful of<br>awards and by any respected measure of<br>impact professor barrett consistently<br>is in the top one percent of scientists<br>around the world<br>in march professor barrett came to new<br>zealand as part of the new zealand<br>writers festival to talk about her book<br>how emotions are made the secret life of<br>the brain<br>the university of wakato is a proud<br>sponsor of the festival<br>during her stay here at the university<br>professor barrett delivered a sold-out<br>public lecture<br>and received an honorary doctorate this<br>is the university's most prestigious<br>honor<br>and it recognized her substantial<br>contribution to the field of<br>psychological science<br>and her pioneering approach to human<br>emotion<br>and now professor barrett has a new book<br>seven and a half lessons about the brain<br>a collection of short essays that amazon<br>has described as one of the best books<br>of 2020.<br>they named it an editor's pick and they<br>announced it in a spectacular billboard<br>in new york city's times square but when<br>it comes to praise for professor<br>barrett's new book<br>don't just take amazon's word for it you<br>can take leonard melodnose<br>seven and a half lessons about the brain<br>reads like a novel he says one whose<br>main character<br>is all of us read this book it will make<br>you smarter about yourself<br>and your species or take the kirkus<br>reviews<br>which i claim the book is an excellent<br>education in brain science<br>or my favorite review from stanford<br>neuroscientist david eagleman<br>who described the book this way<br>beautiful writing and sublime insights<br>that will blow your mind like a string<br>of firecrackers<br>if you want to run down to the brain and<br>its magic start here<br>you can find professor barrett's book in<br>all the usual places including online<br>from one of my favorite shops<br>unity books in wellington in the<br>meantime we hope you enjoy this<br>conversation with professor lisa feldman<br>barrett<br>in which we talk about her new book the<br>state of the world<br>and answer some of your questions<br>seven and a half lessons about the brain<br>here's my first question<br>lisa barrett the half do you have a fear<br>no but i have a definite desire to be<br>different<br>okay um and unique<br>um and and also i occasionally aspire to<br>funny although that's hard in my house<br>because<br>my daughter and my husband are both like<br>um really really really funny people so<br>i usually come in third<br>oh you're funny well often not<br>on purpose i mean i try but<br>anyways i thought seven and a half<br>lessons was a cute<br>title but also i'm not really telling<br>the whole story of brain evolution i'm<br>only telling a little snippet it does<br>feel<br>like a half lesson and so um i i think<br>it's um<br>i think it's it's truth in advertising<br>oh that's great uh do you have a do you<br>have a favorite lesson<br>out of the seven and a half um<br>yeah well i have favorites for different<br>things<br>um i i think the half lesson is my<br>favorite<br>in the sense of um i think it's just<br>incredibly cool i think brain evolution<br>is incredibly cool<br>i think the question of like why do we<br>even have a brain is incredibly cool and<br>the whole<br>the whole evolutionary story um<br>only part of which i tell this lesson is<br>really um<br>unexpected and um<br>so that's fun i like i like things that<br>are unexpected and things that make me<br>that challenge my own beliefs um<br>i like the seventh<br>lesson because i think um<br>which is the seventh lesson is about<br>civilization so how do we<br>how do we create reality um how do our<br>brains<br>in concert with one another and our<br>bodies you know<br>create reality i like that lesson<br>because i think<br>there are moments where<br>you can connect what's written to the<br>current moment<br>and als although the book was written<br>you know obviously completed before<br>um the pandemic started or before the<br>the presidential election in the united<br>states and i also like it because<br>um<br>in there are places where i'm being a<br>little snarky<br>um but then but then<br>very quickly i'm becoming i'm really<br>inviting people to have<br>to think deeply about some things and<br>that contrast is fun<br>i think um and i would say<br>i like lesson three which is about um<br>little brains how little brains wire<br>themselves<br>to become adult brains that lesson i<br>like because<br>it's one place where i felt um<br>i broadcast for people that i take off<br>my lab coat and i basically<br>i try really hard in each lesson not to<br>tell people what to think but to invite<br>them to think<br>um but um in that lesson i come pretty<br>close to telling people what to think<br>having to do with childhood poverty and<br>the effect on the brain and i feel<br>really passionate about that<br>um and i feel like the the science is<br>really on my side and politics really<br>gets in the way<br>of doing what's right and so i feel very<br>str i feel very strongly about that so<br>um that was an opportunity for me to you<br>know express<br>like responsibly ex<br>express my views based on the science as<br>i understand it<br>how would this book have been different<br>if you had written it even<br>five years ago would there be fewer<br>lessons or would there be different<br>lessons<br>that's so interesting that you asked me<br>that because you know um<br>about i guess almost 15 years ago now<br>i was gonna write a book called six<br>facts about the brain<br>and i realize i'm using the f word fact<br>which scientists don't like we don't<br>like that f word because<br>you know everything is probabilistic and<br>contextual and so on<br>but um but i really had this idea of<br>writing six facts about the brain<br>and um if you<br>look at those facts and i decided not to<br>write it really because i was<br>awarded a an nih director's pioneer<br>award<br>um right when i was starting to write<br>the book i had just<br>started a sabbatical and i was just<br>starting to write the book and<br>and then i was given this award very<br>lucky to receive this award<br>but it meant that was the end of my<br>sabbatical and the end of my book<br>um and uh and so<br>if you look back though um i would say<br>that um that<br>not every single one of the essays is<br>exactly the same<br>but they there's a family resemblance<br>huh well that's interesting<br>yeah yeah that's really interesting uh<br>i love that i'm just looking at your<br>website about some of these<br>quotes and i really like this one seven<br>and a half lessons about the brain reads<br>like a novel one whose main character is<br>that's really nice and it will make you<br>smarter about yourself and your species<br>so any idea what<br>how will this book how will this book<br>make me smarter lisa<br>about myself i would like to be smarter<br>about myself<br>first of all i think that<br>sorry i've got some in my throat first<br>of all<br>i think that i need a glass of water<br>first of all i think that um<br>i really think that science and<br>philosophy are tools for living<br>and i don't necessarily mean that in a<br>self-help kind of way<br>i mean that um that really the best<br>science and the best philosophy<br>and maybe this even applies to you know<br>to history and anthropology too<br>really have little nuggets of knowledge<br>that you can use<br>to to think about<br>who you are like what kind of a human<br>are you what kind of a human do you want<br>to be<br>and what kind of choices do you have how<br>much responsibility do you have for<br>yourself and for other people<br>um and i think these are big perennial<br>questions<br>then and all of us need a little bit of<br>nudge to think about them<br>so that we don't wake up and we're 70<br>and wonder what we did with our lives<br>write a series of essays that were<br>entertaining that would<br>offer people little nuggets of<br>neuroscience that they could take to a<br>dinner party<br>because you know when i was writing this<br>i was assuming we were all still having<br>dinner parties<br>um take to a dinner party entertain your<br>friends<br>have a little bit of fun but also<br>have the lessons linger and where you<br>would<br>you would continue to think about them<br>so even though each one only takes you<br>know half an hour or something to read<br>it's a there are little essays about<br>very very big ideas<br>and they they're written in a way to<br>make to make<br>to sort of invite you to think and to<br>keep thinking to kind of linger<br>on these ideas um for for a little while<br>after you read them<br>and my so far the kinds of reviews the<br>book is getting and the comments i'm<br>getting from people<br>indicate that it was largely successful<br>i mean there are a lot of people reading<br>the book who would never pick up a<br>science book ever<br>you know that's just not their interest<br>and that that's partly what i was going<br>for i mean in a way i wrote it as a kind<br>of um<br>you know choose your own adventure right<br>you can just read the essays<br>and that's fine and get something out of<br>it if you want a little more of a<br>traditional popular science experience<br>you can read the appendix<br>and if you really want to dive deep on<br>reference scientific references<br>from peer-reviewed journals<br>or other books you know there's a whole<br>website<br>uh full of web notes full of references<br>so people can can dive into the science<br>as little or as much as<br>as they want but it shows everybody<br>how much fun science is i hope so i<br>don't think you need that lesson but i<br>think<br>it's not for some people that's probably<br>a bit of an epiphany<br>and i hope i think it will maybe<br>maybe lead you to think a little bit<br>about<br>uh questions about human nature<br>and your human nature that you know<br>maybe you haven't thought about for a<br>while<br>yeah that's cool uh<br>i'm gonna ask you some questions that<br>people have<br>sent in and uh hopefully we have enough<br>time to get through all of them and<br>can go off tangents if we wish uh so<br>here's one<br>uh it's about the state of big<br>technology companies taking advantage of<br>social media<br>altering our habits uh<br>can you talk about the implications of<br>you know maybe<br>put that in a context that has to do<br>with what you do shaping our emotions<br>and behavior and<br>and comment on that maybe what you would<br>like to see them<br>well in order to answer this question i<br>i i i have to<br>take a few steps back and fill in some<br>um details that we'll need<br>for for me to answer the question in a<br>way that would make sense<br>right the first thing that i would say<br>is that<br>in neuroscience and in really in<br>popular culture we for a long time<br>believe that and some people still<br>believe that<br>um brains evolved you know in an upward<br>progression towards the human brain<br>which is the most rational brain of all<br>and that rationality is really the<br>pinnacle of<br>of and um<br>what we can learn from brain evolution<br>is that that's not actually<br>what happened at all and the main<br>hypothesis now<br>based on um a tremendous amount<br>of evolutionary and developmental<br>neuroscience is that<br>brains you can't really say what a brain<br>evolved for but you can say brains<br>one of the most brain's most important<br>job is to run your body to run<br>the systems of your body in a<br>metabolically efficient way<br>that doesn't mean that everything is<br>reduced to metabolism but it does mean<br>that metabolism<br>is a hidden factor in everything<br>psychological that you do<br>everything that's psychologically<br>meaningful to you um metabolism is a<br>hidden factor<br>and your brain so the um the technical<br>word for what your brain is doing<br>is allostasis which is um predictive<br>regulation of your body<br>your brain in every moment is attempting<br>to anticipate the needs of your body<br>and meet those needs before they arise<br>um<br>and you might wonder what does this have<br>to do with social media or technology<br>companies and i'm going to get there<br>because i actually think the link is<br>important for people to understand<br>so when i'm talking to the public i<br>explain allostasis which is a mouthful<br>as uh by a metaphor called body<br>budgeting so you can think about your<br>brain as running a budget for your body<br>and it's not budgeting you know money<br>it's budgeting salt and glucose and<br>water and oxygen and all the resources<br>that your<br>body needs to stay alive um<br>so that you know you can do the most<br>important job that you have from<br>evolution's perspective<br>which is to pass your genes on to the<br>next generation<br>and have that offspring survive to<br>so your brain is running a budget for<br>your body<br>and you can think about deposits like<br>sleeping and eating healthfully<br>and drinking water and so on you can<br>think about<br>spending like exercise is an investment<br>right where you expect to get a return<br>on that investment it's a big<br>expenditure but you expect to get a<br>return<br>and in general the biggest expenditures<br>you have<br>um are moving your body and learning<br>something new<br>so those are like those are the real<br>expensive items<br>um you know i like to tell my i like to<br>tell my husband like when you know when<br>i<br>there's a you know really beautiful pair<br>of shoes or a gorgeous jacket that i<br>really want and he's like<br>looking at me like at the price i'm like<br>the most expensive thing that i can do<br>is learn something new you know so<br>um this jacket doesn't even come close<br>to that expense<br>so that's my pathetic attempt at a joke<br>anyways<br>so um what does this<br>uh what does this have to do with social<br>media<br>well it turns out that you know<br>things that are very predictable to you<br>things that you expect<br>that you easily understand information<br>that you're familiar with or that you've<br>seen before or that you can easily<br>predict<br>is um not very expensive for you<br>to process and information which is<br>unexpected<br>novel unusual is very expensive for you<br>to process<br>okay so the situation we have<br>with social media is the following we<br>have<br>um or technology companies you know we<br>have<br>technology companies that are basically<br>using machine learning algorithms<br>serving us<br>um material that is similar to or<br>consistent with<br>what we've already consumed so<br>terrific um uh<br>um movie um documentary on this<br>the social dilemma on netflix really<br>fantastic<br>depiction of this and<br>it's comfortable for people because it's<br>familiar<br>and it's similar to what they already<br>believe or stuff they've already<br>consumed<br>and it's not very metabolically costly<br>and you know right now<br>maybe not even right now but for a while<br>now<br>the cultural context in which we live is<br>pretty expensive from a<br>body budgeting kind of standpoint so if<br>i had to architect a<br>cultural context that would bankrupt a<br>human body budget<br>and throw people into depression or<br>um you know opioid addiction or<br>any number of metabolic illnesses it<br>would be the one<br>that we live in not all of us but many<br>of us you know in modern<br>western civilization um<br>uh you don't sleep enough don't eat very<br>healthy<br>often don't exercise enough might live<br>in a food desert<br>might have real issues with real with<br>economics you know<br>the how much they earn or economic<br>distress concerns about being able to<br>feed their kids or take care of their<br>kids like real<br>serious um demands on the body budget<br>lots of withdrawals<br>not a lot of deposits add to that<br>you know a culture of like casual<br>brutality and how people speak to each<br>other<br>and um the political<br>um situation in in a lot of countries<br>with nationalism<br>rising or not i mean like you know for<br>some people<br>the rise in nationalism is not troubling<br>but for a lot of people it is<br>um anyways you add all of these things<br>together and what you have are people<br>who are really really encumbered<br>metabolically but they don't experience<br>it as a metabolic encumberment they just<br>feel like<br> they feel like basically<br>and um you know do i think this is the<br>only reason that depression is on the<br>rise and opioid<br>dependence is on the rise and so on no<br>it's not the only reason but i do think<br>that<br>it is partially a reason it is one of<br>the<br>you know we have to stop thinking about<br>these things in like simple linear<br>terms like like there's one cause for<br>any<br>um phenomenon there are usually multiple<br>you know weak non-linear causes that you<br>know synergistically produce<br>an outcome like you know um uh<br>a tsunami of depression you know that is<br>um sweeping<br>many many countries and many many young<br>people along with it<br>so this is the environment in which<br>technology companies are serving you<br>information that keeps you in a silo or<br>that sort of builds a silo for you<br>and the truth is all you have to do is<br>click one button to get out of that silo<br>if you're a conservative you can just<br>click one button and get to the new york<br>times<br>front page um or any other newspaper<br>you know most newspapers you can at<br>least get to their front page<br>if you're a liberal in the united states<br>all you have to do you can't click on<br>the wall street journal because<br>they're behind a pay wall but you can<br>click on fox news<br>so you know how much um<br>effort does one click<br>take on the one hand you might say not a<br>lot of effort<br>but on the other hand you know<br>we are asking people<br>to when i say this what i'm asking<br>people to do<br>is to make an expenditure to expose<br>themselves to something that is new<br>and novel and unpredictable and probably<br>that they don't like<br>yeah it's not the click it's what you do<br>when you get there right exactly<br>so it is kind of but so what i would<br>suggest is that it is kind of like<br>um exercise that um<br>it's it's it's a metabolic expenditure<br>but it's a metabolic expenditure that<br>will pay dividends later<br>and so it's an investment so<br>just like exercise it feels like<br>when you're doing it but you know it you<br>know the payoff is going to be<br>it's going to be good later you know<br>you're going to be glad that you did it<br>later even though right now you're<br>really not happy that you're doing it<br>i think it's kind of the same and i<br>think what technology companies should<br>do<br>is um make that easier for people<br>i i think that everybody has to stop<br>saying this is not my responsibility i<br>don't have to care about this<br>i think we should be making it easier<br>for people who disagree with each other<br>or who hold really really different<br>views to talk to each other<br>to talk to each other in beneficial ways<br>which doesn't necessarily mean that<br>they're happy or that their minds are<br>changed<br>but it does mean that um they listen to<br>each other<br>and that they try to connect with each<br>other around uh their humanity<br>because you know nationalism isn't<br>rising for<br>for no reason at all there are a bunch<br>of people<br>who for all the people who are made<br>miserable by nationalism there are a<br>bunch of people<br>who are made so miserable that they felt<br>nationalism was their only option<br>and so i i think you know i guess what i<br>think is that um<br>that technology companies can do a lot<br>um in fact the entertainment industry i<br>mean like a lot of the<br>the sort of big cultural um institutions<br>that we have<br>some of which are in industry and and<br>some of which are<br>are in the media and entertainment you<br>know can do a lot<br>actually can have a huge influence um<br>on um not just not just what<br>what you might think of as a a civics<br>issue but it's also a public health<br>issue<br>um that is is really maybe not<br>global but it's certainly<br>sweeping large parts of the western<br>world i would say<br>i was just thinking like a for a place<br>like fox<br>to encourage people to like kind of<br>scaffold them into i don't know<br>watching a bit of here's what rachel<br>maddow said last night<br>you know it's there's uh<br>they would have to do something to get<br>some economic incentive to do that right<br>like because otherwise they're sending<br>their audience<br>away isn't that what they would say yeah<br>sure so i mean i think you know you<br>you have to um i guess what i would what<br>i would say and maybe this is just<br>you know me being like uh you know um<br>a pie in the sky uh intellectual but<br>i don't know how it is everywhere in the<br>industries are more interested in<br>entertainment than they are<br>in education and<br>they confuse entertainment and news<br>i'm certainly not the first person to<br>make that point but you know<br>sometimes i mean i'm a huge fan let's<br>say of like i'm superhero movies you<br>know<br>and my so my family will all watch<br>superhero movie<br>and then you know the amazing like<br>special effects right like black panther<br>love that movie the special effects<br>comes up and they're like<br>a thousand people not a joke<br>like a thousand people working on<br>special effects<br>and i think to myself what if that one<br>of those thousand people who are<br>probably all really brilliant<br>like computer geniuses working on<br>special effects<br>what if they were trying to cure cancer<br>or what if what if they were trying to<br>send the first you know mission to mars<br>or<br>what if they were trying to like you<br>know just like there are so many things<br>that are so<br>interesting about the natural world and<br>so many<br>you know eventually achievable um<br>things that we can do to make people's<br>lives better<br>um uh you know cute<br>you know cure like get rid of<br>childhood poverty around the world you<br>know like just like a lot of<br>a lot of things that could be done yeah<br>if we only put our minds to it and so<br>yeah i mean you know like right now i<br>think for example<br>you know what could technology companies<br>be doing what could<br>in uh the you know um<br>the um music industry be doing what<br>could the media be doing what could<br>holly would be doing in all of the<br>you know movie industries around the<br>world i don't know how about<br>social influence to get people to take<br>vaccines and wear masks<br>like what about using network science<br>what we know like this beautiful work by<br>betsy pollock showing that you know when<br>you want to reduce bullying in a school<br>you don't educate everybody in school<br>you just go find the popular kids and<br>you educate them and then it just<br>percolates out to everybody<br>it's like really consistent with lesson<br>seven um<br>but it's really consistent with uh<br>evolutionary um<br>anthropology work in evolutionary<br>anthropology um<br>that you know we we learn from one<br>another<br>and we we are there are a lot of animals<br>who are social learners but we are<br>really like you know souped-up social<br>learners<br>and we tend to learn uh faster and<br>better from people<br>who are have prestige or power or<br>influence and so<br>you know companies could all<br>get together and find i mean we have<br>around the world<br>brilliant marketers who try to sell us<br>all kinds of we don't need<br>what about putting them on the case and<br>trying to get like a bunch of<br>influencers in<br>every domain of influence to try to get<br>people to<br>take the vaccines because you know<br>like you can spend billions of dollars<br>making a vaccine<br>but then you have to get people to take<br>it and you have to get people to take it<br>in<br>huge numbers in order to be effective<br>that might not be an issue everywhere in<br>the world and it might not be an issue<br>in new zealand but i can tell you it is<br>certainly an issue<br>in on the united states and so the shoe<br>people<br>it reminds makes me think a number of<br>these questions are just uh<br>well i mean talking about some other<br>things from a different point of view so<br>on your on your website<br>luisafeldmanbar.com<br>you have an essay called every pandemic<br>tells a story<br>in which you write about the villains<br>involved in<br>covid and the pandemic and you say uh<br>of course scientists for example are not<br>the villain<br>and i'm wondering how did how did<br>scientists become a villain<br>and and scientists are always the<br>villain or they're idiots i mean like<br>look at how scientists are portrayed in<br>movies they're either<br>evil or stupid i mean right okay yeah<br>you know i mean science<br>i don't know i mean maybe depressing<br>yeah it's really depressing so<br>baby i mean why aren't scientists on the<br>cover of<br>vogue why aren't scientists on the cover<br>of<br>you know people magazine<br>like we you know you know i always<br>thought that um<br>somebody should do like a 10 o'clock<br>drama so i don't know how it is in<br>new zealand but in the states um and in<br>canada<br>the two countries i've lived in you know<br>there are always these 10 o'clock dramas<br>these are the cop shows and the lawyer<br>shows whatever and they're always<br>doctor shows and they're always filled<br>with like money and sex and intrigue and<br>you know and i'm thinking you know<br>academia<br>okay money is not always there but you<br>know there are grant dollars and you<br>know<br>people are i mean it's really a lot<br>about ideas and discoveries and you know<br>there<br>is illicit sex and there are all these<br>like really interesting<br>like there's always like that evil<br>person and like a person who's really<br>striving hard you know just like really<br>wants to do the right thing and like<br>there are all these really you know um<br>interesting characters that that you<br>could portray and<br>you could make science a really cool<br>sexy thing to do<br>like as much as being a banker um<br>because you know um in the end it<br>you know if you if you go into if you go<br>into finance and you make a lot of money<br>in the end<br>all money becomes to you is a way of<br>keeping score<br>academics also have a way of keeping<br>score you know we call them publications<br>i suppose that's a really cynical thing<br>to say but oh it's not as cynical as<br>what i was thinking<br>um but but i guess my point my point is<br>that um<br>science is fun science is interesting<br>science is um<br>often incredibly frustrating um<br>but um but<br>the way that science is usually<br>portrayed not necessarily in novels but<br>in the movies and on television and so<br>on is usually<br>um you know scientists are evil or<br>they're<br>they're they're incredibly stupid like<br>they're just<br>you know totally total they're not even<br>the smart kind of geek<br>you know they're just like like a like a<br>total um doofus<br>and um<br>i wrote that piece um<br>you know that piece appears on my blog<br>on my website because i couldn't get a<br>that's sad um well it is what it<br>is you know yeah i had something to say<br>and i really wanted to say it<br>so um yeah so it's there for anybody to<br>read it's really about the stories that<br>we tell ourselves<br>um and how those stories can sometimes<br>be helpful and sometimes not so helpful<br>and sometimes we can<br>you know in order to change the course<br>so would you draw a line from what you<br>were saying earlier<br>and what you just said now about<br>you know people are really just heavily<br>taxed on a number of different<br>dimensions<br>into how we get to this<br>outrage over mask wearing or<br>first you say don't wear a mask now you<br>say we're a mess or people thinking the<br>election is rigged or it seems like<br>there's this whole<br>some people call it outrage culture or<br>you know like<br>is it just easier or is that all you<br>have left is to have that kind of<br>reaction rather than to sit back and<br>have the<br>you know um i feel like any<br>any way that i answer this question can<br>sound trite<br>and sort of common sensical so i'm gonna<br>answer it in a bit of a different way<br>and say the following<br>i um<br>can't i could not fathom why someone<br>would not wear it why somebody would<br>choose not to wear a mask<br>i just could not fathom why someone<br>would<br>choose to put other people in harm's way<br>i think part of the reason is that the<br>messaging was bad<br>people do not understand their own<br>biological residue<br>even very sophisticated people who you<br>would imagine to be sophisticated about<br>such things like physicians for example<br>you would expect that they<br>they don't have to be virologists you<br>would imagine that just your average<br>physician<br>and some are but some are not<br>right um some of them you know wear<br>their masks down here it's like<br>you know that just completes wishful<br>thinking you know<br>um so that that's part of it and part of<br>it maybe<br>um you know uh like why should i make<br>myself uncomfortable for<br>other people who i don't even know you<br>know but i think there's something<br>deeper going on actually and<br>so i really put myself to a challenge<br>and i<br>i decided that you know i was gonna sort<br>of like drink my<br>own kool-aid and um i decided that i<br>wanted to try to<br>you know see the try to see the world<br>from the perspective of somebody who<br>doesn't want to wear a mask or who<br>feels like their um<br>you know their rights are being<br>infringed on and um<br>when in fact you know being asked to<br>wear a mask is<br>you can i guess you can see it as<br>infringing on your rights but<br>not wearing a mask in my view is<br>infringing on the<br>on the potential life actually of other<br>people<br>um and uh but so i but so i tried to put<br>those you know arguments aside and i<br>tried you know and<br>at the same time i was listening to<br>um a book by uh robert reich<br>um called the system so he's an<br>economist you know who was in the<br>um obama admin the first obama<br>administration i think right and<br>um i think that's right um was he i<br>think he was<br>clinton something maybe he's a treasury<br>secretary yeah man that's right yeah<br>you would know i'm not i'm not american<br>by birth so you know<br>i was who knows anyways<br>he was a democrat using a democratic<br>administration but the book<br>um really takes to task<br>both republicans and democrats actually<br>in the united states um for<br>setting up what he calls an oligarchy<br>you know that there are a couple of like<br>a handful of like incredibly wealthy<br>people<br>who enrich themselves<br>at the expense of the working person<br>and um in order to keep power<br>and there was you know several passages<br>i found really compelling but one<br>was that before the 1980s<br>the average ceo made<br>20 times what his and i use that<br>adjective very clearly his<br>employees typically made<br>and his job was to be a steward of the<br>community and of the people<br>for the people who worked for his<br>company<br>his corporation now<br>ceos make on average 300 times<br>what their employees make<br>and they no longer see themselves as<br>the stewards of anybody other than their<br>own wealth<br>and whatever gestures they make towards<br>um charity or philanthropies<br>are really just gestures relative to the<br>mountains and mountains and mountains of<br>money<br>that they are essentially stealing from<br>the productivity of their workers<br>and i i just<br>you know so i just try to imagine i'm a<br>person let's imagine myself i'm a person<br>who<br>i actually come from a working poor<br>family i work<br>two jobs to put myself through school<br>and<br>so i'm imagining that um i'm living<br>paycheck to paycheck<br>my wages haven't gone up in 20 years i<br>can't give my kids the things i want to<br>give them<br>i worry about my ability to send them to<br>college<br>um or even just to get them new shoes<br>for the next school year or a new<br>computer or whatever right if<br>my daughter when my daughter uh you know<br>during covert her computer broke<br>and we bought her a new computer<br>but like there are millions of people<br>who can't do that and<br>it's a really serious thing during covid<br>because if you don't have a computer<br>you can't go to school you know you<br>can't because<br>you're cuz you're using your computer<br>for school assuming you even have a<br>computer to begin with<br>so i'm thinking to myself imagine that<br>you are<br>that you are living like this<br>and maybe even imagine that<br>your body budget is encumbered for other<br>reasons you know it's not<br>just that you're stressed over you know<br>which means you know metabolically<br>you know encumbered over you know<br>economic things let's say<br>there are other things too like maybe<br>you know you believe um that abortion is<br>is evil you know personally<br>i'm a supporter of um a woman's choice<br>to do<br>uh over her own body but imagine for a<br>minute if you weren't<br>like imagine if you really believed<br>really really really believed<br>that um uh<br>life began at conception you would have<br>experienced the last couple of decades<br>in the united states as a genocide<br>now you can say oh you know you can sort<br>of argue with that if you're<br>on the other side of that debate but<br>that's not the goal of this exercise the<br>goal of this exercise<br>is to try to put yourself in somebody<br>else's shoes not so that you can argue<br>with them in your head<br>but so that you can really try to<br>understand what could bring them to the<br>point where<br>they would think that<br>voting for trump is a good thing or<br>believing his stories about kovid<br>is okay or believing that um it's okay<br>to um you know throw democracy in the<br>toilet because it really hasn't done<br>that much for you to begin with<br>i mean or or even just take a stand over<br>something what that seems like really<br>small but maybe not small to you<br>because if your life is already filled<br>with a bunch of<br>like with it with discomfort after<br>discomfort after discomfort<br>maybe one more discomfort is just the<br>breaking point i mean<br>we've all had moments where we feel not<br>one more thing i cannot take just one<br>more thing<br>so again i would say it's not that these<br>when you when you go through an exercise<br>like this or when i go through this kind<br>of exercise it's<br>not like i'm letting those people off<br>the hook<br>or saying that um i now think it's okay<br>um that you know they're not wearing<br>masks because that's that's not true<br>but i am i'm trying to really understand<br>how<br>somebody could get to a point where they<br>would do something that to me<br>inexplicably<br>wrong yeah<br>you know and it's like it's the same<br>kind of thing<br>we talked about at the beginning which<br>is like why don't you just click away<br>you know it takes a lot of effort to try<br>and understand a different way of<br>thinking and if you just don't have that<br>in your<br>budget if you haven't budgeted for that<br>it's really hard<br>it is but you can but you can do look i<br>mean<br>uh you know i am um<br>i used to say that i'm not a fan of<br>exercise i think what i would say now<br>is after putting in 30 years on a<br>day-to-day basis i'm probably more of a<br>fan<br>in a sense not in the sense that i enjoy<br>it when i'm doing it because i don't<br>um unless i've like you know lifted a<br>really heavy weight for some reason and<br>not throwing my back out and it's like a<br>big accomplishment i might feel happy<br>for a minute<br>but in general i dread doing it i don't<br>like it while i'm doing it but i feel a<br>lot better after i've done it<br>um and i do it every day and it's in my<br>schedule it's just something i do<br>it's one of the things i do that um i<br>think of as an investment in brain<br>health frankly<br>and um uh<br>and exposing yourself to views and news<br>that um you don't like and that you<br>might even find offensive<br>is also an investment you can see it in<br>exactly the same way<br>sometimes it just allows you to have<br>empathy<br>and dissolving that anger is actually as<br>good for you<br>as it is for other people you know the<br>content from a contemplative standpoint<br>anger is considered a form of ignorance<br>like if you're if you can be angry then<br>you really don't understand<br>um you know what the what the other side<br>of that argument is<br>sometimes you know investing in in um<br>some perspective taking helps you hone<br>your own arguments better<br>sometimes right actually helps you just<br>connect with somebody on a human basis<br>and you can just feel good about the<br>fact that you treated somebody with<br>human dignity<br>even if you completely disagree with<br>them um you know there are lots of<br>uh lots of ways that you can find<br>meaning in it but in my view<br>it's it's it's something akin to to<br>exercise it's a it's a way of um<br>of um keeping your brain healthy<br>right right right uh<br>okay a question that i think is from one<br>of my colleagues<br>is about what are your thoughts on the<br>relationship between<br>constructed emotions your view of<br>constructive emotions<br>and how we see ourselves as authentic<br>particularly against the backdrop of<br>well<br>there are so many ways to answer that<br>question um<br>i guess the first thing i would say is<br>that<br>the traditional sort of classical view<br>of emotion<br>um where you know emotions come<br>pre-wired into your brain at birth<br>and um that your brain is kind of like a<br>battleground between emotion and<br>rationality for control of your behavior<br>um in that view which is wrong by the<br>way there's really no evidence for it<br>at all um uh but in that view<br>emotions were seen as<br>evidence of authentic self<br>that you know this was really what you<br>really what you experience really what<br>you believed<br>um and um<br>and actually you know in the court of<br>law<br>in the united st actually in western in<br>western courts of law<br>usually you were considered less<br>responsible<br>um for unfortunate actions for the harm<br>that you would cause<br>um uh because you were less in control<br>of yourself and you had less free will<br>when you were under the influence of<br>emotion<br>you know i<br>there's so much to say about that um<br>some of which i said<br>in my first book you know how emotions<br>are made there's a little chapter on<br>emotion in the law for example um<br>but i guess what i would say is this<br>when you are born you are not born with<br>an adult brain you are a baby's brain is<br>not a miniature adult brain<br>it's a brain that is waiting for wiring<br>instructions from the world<br>and the baby's brain wires itself<br>to the world that is cultivated for that<br>infant<br>both the physical world and the social<br>world<br>so what a baby's brain<br>is doing in a child's brain all really<br>up to well<br>continually actually because our brains<br>continue even though they don't continue<br>to develop<br>uh you know at that same speed we have<br>plasticity throughout our lives<br>we can acculturate to new environments<br>we're learning<br>things all the time um<br>using exactly the same neural mechanisms<br>as we use in infancy<br>but basically um<br>your brain is bootstrapped into itself a<br>model<br>of your own body in the world that you<br>or in the the niche the parts of the<br>world that are important to your<br>well-being and your brain uses<br>past experience to reassemble<br>um uh what what we would call<br>you know an internal model of the world<br>it's constantly reassembling to the past<br>as a way of<br>creating uh the immediate future which<br>becomes your present<br>and it's very very very automatic<br>much of the time meaning you're really<br>you're not<br>thinking about it you're not doing it<br>deliberately it's just that's just the<br>way the brain is working<br>it's just constantly constructing<br>constantly<br>um reassembling the past um for the<br>purpose of controlling and<br>um controlling your actions and and<br>constructing your experience in the<br>present<br>you know what's authentic really<br>is um that um<br>you know your your brain tailors this<br>internal model to the immediate<br>circumstances<br>that you're in so what's authentic is<br>um that uh you um<br>are not one you don't have one self like<br>with an<br>asset of essences you know you have a<br>set of features<br>that you can use to describe yourself um<br>based on the situation that you're in<br>based on whatever past experiences<br>are most relevant to the situation that<br>you're in and<br>some features are foregrounded at times<br>other times they're backgrounded<br>i mean basically what's authentic is to<br>think of yourself<br>not as um you know<br>a static self which is the same in every<br>context that you're in<br>but you know who you are how<br>your way of being in the world is<br>largely influenced<br>by where you are and who you're around<br>and so and you have a lot of control<br>over your actions in in<br>if you understand how that works so and<br>by that i don't mean that you have to<br>like<br>put the brakes on you know some uh<br>irrational<br>you know response in order to respond<br>more<br>rationally i mean uh but you know you<br>can choose to put yourself in<br>a context where you can be your best<br>self<br>be a be the person that you want to be<br>um don't<br>you you can most people can't control<br>everything about their<br>context but they can control some things<br>everybody can control something<br>you know so if you don't want to eat<br>potato chips don't keep them in the<br>house i mean like that's the that's the<br>basic message<br>if you want to be a generous person<br>create a circumstance for yourself where<br>it's easy for you to be generous<br>where you can use generous instances<br>from the past<br>to be generous again and if you don't<br>have that past<br>cultivate it for yourself you can't go<br>back into your past and change what's<br>happened<br>but you can change what you do right now<br>with quite a bit of effort but that<br>seeds your brain to predict<br>you know to kind of like automatically<br>use you know your<br>what you're doing now it sees your brain<br>to do something automatically different<br>in the future<br>so i mean i i'm not really sure what<br>your colleague intended whether you know<br>the idea that construction<br>somehow implies that the whole thing is<br>like very artificial but<br>the fact is everything you see<br>everything you hear<br>everything you feel everything you smell<br>everything<br>is constructed everything<br>is made up partly every experience you<br>have every action you take is<br>partly so it's like some combination of<br>what's out there<br>and in here and up here<br>always always if<br>if what you experience is not partly<br>driven<br>by your internal model by your past<br>then you are experientially blind you<br>what you<br>yeah all right uh<br>i don't want to take up more of your<br>time<br>it's been a really great conversation uh<br>and<br>you i always like talking to you you are<br>beautiful writer<br>and you are performing an important<br>service for everybody and i<br>personally can't wait for you to come<br>back here and visit<br>in the after times in the after times<br>yeah the after times wow always<br>wonderful to talk to you marianne</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
