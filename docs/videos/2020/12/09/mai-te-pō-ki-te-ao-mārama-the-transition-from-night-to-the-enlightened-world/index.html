He acknowledges the weight of expectation for the court to improve its response to the disproportionate rate at which Māori interact with the law. He draws on the rich legacy of his Maori and European forebears, including Te Maiharoa, a Kai Tahu prophet, who led a migration to Te Ao Mārama in the Mackenzie Basin in the late 1870s.<br><br>In this lecture, Chief Judge Taumaunu shares his thoughts on the modern-day pursuit of Te Ao Mārama as it relates to the way forward for New Zealand’s District Court; a place where all New Zealanders should feel that they can come to seek justice, and be heard and understood.

forefront<br>of cutting-edge legal research and its<br>dissemination within the professional<br>community<br>and civil society and i'm sure that this<br>lecture tonight<br>is going to contribute to that cutting<br>edge legal knowledge<br>now it gives me great pleasure to<br>introduce sam<br>hood sam is managing partner of norris<br>ward mckinnon<br>and i'm inviting him to say a few words<br>see<br>one of the purposes of the me i just<br>gave was to acknowledge those departed<br>those who have departed from this earth<br>and i know that sounds quite<br>probably quite spiritual in nature but i<br>do want to take a moment<br>to acknowledge the late warren scotter<br>warren is a legend of the waikato legal<br>community<br>he was a long-standing litigation<br>partner in the great firm harkness henry<br>he was a staunch advocate of the<br>hartness henry lecture which is what the<br>selection originally was and even when<br>it became the norriswald mckinnon<br>lecture warren continued his involvement<br>in that<br>at norriswood mckinnon every time this<br>lecture rolls around we have a chance to<br>reflect<br>on warren and his contribution to the<br>lecture and to the law and i'd just like<br>to acknowledge<br>uh judge simon menzies in particular who<br>had been a long-standing partner<br>of warrens and his uh sorely missed<br>introducing the keynote speaker in a few<br>minutes is it's hard to do the job<br>justice<br>but every every life has a story and<br>every story is an adventure<br>and for the chief judge his adventure<br>began in in gisborne<br>deep in the heart of ngati para<br>territory which is one of the eoi 2<br>to which the chief judge papas<br>the other being naitahu<br>when i think of ngati pero i think of<br>leaders and and warriors i think of i<br>think mount hikirani that the sacred<br>monument which i believe is one of the<br>chief judges maunga<br>and i think in particular the 28th maori<br>battalion and i think it was the<br>charlie company that had the close<br>affiliation with<br>with uh with ngati padau<br>second lieutenant moana nuyaki was a<br>the only member of the battalion who was<br>awarded the the vc<br>it was a posthumous award for gallantry<br>in north africa<br>and so when you think of tortara<br>like that it's no small surprise that<br>the chief judge<br>the chief judge spent his early years in<br>tolanga bay before he<br>went down south to naitahu territory in<br>christchurch<br>he went to primary school and high<br>school in christchurch<br>and at the age of 16 he left high school<br>to pursue a career in the new zealand<br>army<br>i understand that he spent five years in<br>the army four of those years<br>in the royal new zealand signal corps<br>as a non-commissioned officer now anyone<br>who's had any affiliation with the army<br>will know that it's the ncos<br>who run the place and i'm sure that in<br>addition to<br>traditional army discipline the chief<br>judge would have learnt the importance<br>of clear communication<br>21 i think 1993 the chief judge<br>graduated from victoria university<br>i understand that he was the first<br>member of his hapu<br>ngati kanohi to graduate as a lawyer<br>he practiced for about a year in<br>wellington and then returned to his<br>roots in gisborne<br>in 1994 and had a 10-year career<br>practicing as a criminal barrister in<br>jury trials<br>as a advocate in the youth courts and<br>also<br>as lawyer for child in 2004<br>chief judge tomonu became a district<br>court judge<br>he was the first judge to take the oath<br>of office and allegiance in english and<br>tedious<br>and he began his service in whangarei<br>followed by waitakira in 2014<br>he transferred to auckland and sat on<br>the bench in auckland<br>and in 2019 he became<br>the chief district court judge if that<br>record wasn't distinguished enough the<br>chief judge continued his service to the<br>military<br>in 2012 he was appointed a judge of the<br>court martial of new zealand<br>and in 2018 he became<br>a deputy chief judge of that court<br>he's joined today by his wife ingrid who<br>i understand also served in the army i<br>won't give a biography because she's<br>going to be embarrassed if i do but also<br>joined by<br>by by whanau and i think some may be on<br>in transit as well<br>ladies and gentlemen please join me in<br>giving a warm welcome to our<br>guest guest speaker chief judge hemi<br>taumanu<br>my<br>can i just endorse all of the greetings<br>that have been already extended<br>to all of the distinguished guests who<br>are here<br>you know who you are and<br>rather than repeat them i just want to<br>welcome everyone who is here<br>and really thank you for coming<br>towards the end of the 19th century<br>in the later years of his life after he<br>had<br>imprisonment armed conflict with the<br>crown<br>an official pardon and the form<br>the canoe for you to paddle after me is<br>the law<br>only the law can be set against the law<br>i seek refuge in the law as a parent for<br>these powerful words continue to<br>resonate<br>and provide a relevant historical<br>context<br>for the modern day vision for the<br>district court<br>that vision is simply expressed<br>the district court should be a place<br>where all people can come to seek<br>justice<br>regardless of their culture or ethnicity<br>and regardless of who they are or where<br>is maitepo marama<br>the transition from night to the<br>enlightened world<br>cause for transformative change and the<br>district court response<br>so that title touches on three related<br>topics<br>the first concerns a maori world view<br>about this concept of taomarama<br>that has helped to shape the modern day<br>vision for the district court<br>the second topic touches on the multiple<br>calls for<br>transformative change that have been<br>the third topic relates to the district<br>court response<br>in terms of what we have done so far<br>in this regard i intend to speak about<br>the district court generally<br>and i also intend to speak specifically<br>about the hamilton district court<br>and the alcohol and other drug treatment<br>2021<br>in doing so i make it clear that the<br>pathway forward<br>is one that is intended to include not<br>only the two founding cultures<br>but to include all new zealanders of all<br>ethnicities<br>and of all cultures who are affected by<br>it is also a pathway that will respect<br>the independence of judicial officers<br>who will continue to apply the relevant<br>law and decide cases on the individual<br>merits<br>our intention will be to ensure<br>to the maximum extent possible that the<br>best available information is presented<br>to our judges<br>and our other trials of fact<br>to enable them to make well-informed<br>decisions<br>i intend to frame these remarks within<br>the applicable<br>criminal justice policy and legislative<br>reform<br>in the criminal justice system<br>are both matters for the executive and<br>examples that come to mind are the<br>legislation that established the youth<br>court in 1989<br>and in more recent times the government<br>funding that has been allocated for<br>specialist services<br>to support the alcohol and other drug<br>as chief district court judge i have a<br>statutory responsibility<br>to ensure the orderly and efficient<br>conduct<br>of the business of the court this<br>includes duties<br>around rostering of judges scheduling of<br>work<br>setting standards for best practice in<br>the district court<br>and to oversee and promote the<br>professional development<br>and education of judges<br>nothing i am about to discuss will<br>necessarily<br>clearly both the judiciary and the<br>executive<br>have a role to play in the kaupapa of<br>transforming the courts<br>and both branches of government have to<br>respect the prerogatives<br>and constitutional boundaries of the<br>other<br>in saying that however i do wish to<br>acknowledge the<br>presence of the secretary for justice<br>and<br>chief executive of the ministry for<br>justice mr andrew kibblewhite<br>and in doing so i look forward to<br>working<br>relationship with the executive as this<br>important work continues to be<br>progressed<br>and i turn now to the first topic that i<br>mentioned<br>the maori world view about this concept<br>the district court response to calls for<br>has been shaped by this reference to the<br>concept mighty poor kitau marama<br>which literally means the transition<br>from night<br>to the world of light the enlightened<br>world<br>this concept draws on several different<br>threads including the well-known<br>expression<br>and in fact i heard<br>in the karakiya today with that exact<br>expression<br>translated what does that mean the first<br>rays of dawn<br>herald the transition from night to day<br>behold it is a living environment<br>the concepts of tippur and taumaruma<br>have relevance to the maori creation<br>myth<br>when tane mahuta separated his parents<br>by pushing them apart and thereby<br>created<br>this general theme of moving to a more<br>enlightened world<br>is a universal and easy to understand<br>pan cultural<br>concept<br>when my father's great great grandfather<br>rang rangiuya<br>at toliga bay in may 1840<br>i do not know exactly what his thoughts<br>were at the time<br>but on an objective assessment<br>the promises exchanged between the<br>parties to the treaty at least on their<br>face<br>on one view of it the treaty imagined<br>in other words it envisaged the creation<br>of where maori<br>and pakia could live peacefully<br>alongside one another<br>and both parties could have<br>when tuta neho neho one of the leading<br>chiefs of my tribe ngati pro<br>composed his famous hakka takiringutu<br>in the 1870s<br>he expressed his fury that large tracts<br>of maori land<br>were being sold to pakhau settlers and<br>he was concerned about the future<br>problems that this would cause<br>those are the opening words of the hakka<br>that is a reference to the law as a<br>shadow<br>in 1877<br>my mother's great-great-grandfather to<br>me<br>led more than one hundred of his<br>followers on a migration<br>from arufinua which is just south of<br>tamuka in the south island<br>to te au maruma which is now known<br>as the modern day town of omadama in the<br>de maihiro and his followers occupied<br>the land and lived in accordance with<br>tikanga maori<br>consistent with a version of the<br>eventually they were arrested and thrown<br>when my english and scottish ancestors<br>traveled to this country in the eighteen<br>hundreds<br>they too were seeking a better life for<br>they settled in the south island and at<br>various times<br>married my tahu ancestors<br>they in their own way were in pursuit<br>from the time of coupes first voyage of<br>discovery<br>through until the modern day arrival<br>of immigrants from all parts of the<br>world<br>seeking a new life in our country<br>the search for a more enlightened world<br>this idea of tao matama<br>has been a consistent theme throughout<br>i suggest tonight that the calls for<br>transformative change<br>as they relate to the district court<br>could be translated as a concerted call<br>to move towards a more enlightened world<br>but for all people of all cultures<br>and of all ethnicities who are affected<br>this is because modern-day aotearoa new<br>zealand<br>is now a multicultural and vibrant<br>society<br>with two founding cultures bound<br>together by the principle of partnership<br>in modern thinking the vision of hope<br>that is expressed in the treaty<br>relationship<br>now extends to and call include all<br>maori<br>and non-maori new zealanders regardless<br>of ethnicity<br>hence the all-inclusive nature of the<br>this vision and move by the district<br>court<br>will still mean some people<br>who need to be held accountable and<br>responsible<br>will still be held accountable and<br>responsible<br>the sentencing act 2002 will continue to<br>be applied<br>and principled and lawful sentences<br>including imprisonment will still be<br>imposed<br>but we are hoping that this will be in<br>an environment<br>where more well-informed decisions can<br>be consistently made<br>based on better information with better<br>informed participants<br>better understood processes and<br>i want to move on to discuss the second<br>part of the<br>title i referred to relating to calls<br>for transformative change that relate to<br>calls for transformative change to the<br>justice system<br>have been passed down through successive<br>generations<br>they are not a modern phenomenon<br>nor just another worthy contemporary<br>cause<br>they come from all corners of our<br>society<br>and have relevance not just for the<br>founding cultures<br>but also for all other cultures in<br>in saying that though the sense of hurt<br>and unfairness driving the cause for<br>change is deeply felt amongst<br>maori in the 19th century these calls<br>were primarily directed towards maori<br>land alienation<br>when the treaty of waitangi was signed<br>in 1840<br>maori owned almost all of the land in<br>aotearoa<br>by 1892<br>it had reduced to almost a third<br>and a quarter of that was actually<br>leased back to pakistan<br>in the space of a generation<br>maori had effectively been transformed<br>during this period maori were<br>progressively excluded<br>from the economic opportunities of the<br>new<br>colonial society<br>as a result of the combination of<br>factors including armed conflict with<br>the crown<br>resulting land confiscations and the<br>devastating effects of disease on the<br>maori population by the turn of the 20th<br>century<br>maori were considered to be a dying race<br>the maori language was banned in schools<br>certain tikanga practices were banned by<br>statute<br>official government policies effectively<br>promoted<br>the assimilation of maori people into<br>the dominant<br>colonial settler culture<br>in the mid 20th century the maori<br>population began<br>migrating from traditional villages<br>into larger metropolitan urban areas<br>until that time the rate of maori<br>imprisonment was generally<br>proportionate with the maori population<br>percentage<br>however the generation of maori who were<br>part of the urban drift<br>became a visible and conscious minority<br>and faced further official government<br>policies that required maori to<br>assimilate into the mainstream<br>this urban shift and the social and<br>economic difficulties that followed<br>contributed to a dramatic increase in<br>maori representation<br>in the criminal justice system<br>between 1950 and 1970<br>the number of maori people received into<br>prisons compared to all prisoners<br>doubled<br>as the statistics continued in this<br>direction<br>calls for transformative change to the<br>justice system<br>continue to be directed towards the<br>this trend has continued for the last<br>three and a half decades<br>the message underlying these calls for<br>change is that defendants<br>whanau complainants<br>victims witnesses<br>parties and other participants in<br>proceedings<br>are leaving the district court feeling<br>unheard<br>unappreciated misunderstood<br>and in many cases with needs that remain<br>unidentified<br>by my account there have been more than<br>30 reports<br>stretching back over three decades<br>criticizing the justice system's<br>approach to maori<br>in this regard i'm thinking of seminal<br>reports<br>from the mid-1980s such as john<br>rangihoe's pua tautatu<br>the next topic i want to move on to is<br>what has the district court<br>done so far in response to these calls<br>over the past three decades the district<br>court has sought to address many of<br>these calls for change<br>by incrementally developing initiatives<br>including the development of specialist<br>courts<br>designed to meet perceived community<br>needs<br>some of the judge-led initiatives<br>started in the mid-1990s<br>when judges began embarking on regular<br>this was to expose judges to the maori<br>world<br>and for many they had not at that time<br>been exposed to the maori world and this<br>was<br>a journey to a mirai<br>to achieve that exact purpose to<br>increase understanding<br>this was followed by the development of<br>a maori advisory group to the chief<br>district court judge<br>maori announcements to open and closed<br>court<br>and tikanga was incorporated<br>into swearing-in ceremonies for newly<br>appointed judges<br>which are increasingly being held on<br>mirai<br>at the same time there has been a<br>natural development<br>of solution-focused judging in our<br>courts<br>this approach is underpinned by<br>extensive academic and jurisprudential<br>theory<br>it is not mere trend or fad<br>it is both evidence-based and legally<br>sound<br>these specialist courts are heralded<br>as centres of excellence<br>they incorporate te reo and tikanga<br>maori into our court processes<br>they attempt to improve the information<br>that is available to judges<br>they embrace active and involved judging<br>they increase community involvement in<br>the court<br>and they attempt to address the<br>underlying drivers<br>of offending in simple terms<br>silicon solution-focused judging seeks<br>to identify<br>the drivers of offending and to then<br>address them by facilitating the<br>provision of services and community<br>support<br>required to restore lives<br>the first new zealand example of<br>solution-focused judging that i'm aware<br>of<br>occurred in the 1980s when<br>judge mick brown as he was then<br>referred a maori defendant to sir peter<br>sharples<br>and sent him to the team<br>and asked sir peter and the people at<br>the marae to work with that particular<br>man since then<br>in the criminal jurisdiction we have<br>seen the development of a whole raft of<br>specialist courts<br>including the youth court rangatahi<br>courts<br>family violence courts a youth drug<br>the matariki court in kaikohe the<br>homelessness court in auckland<br>the special circumstances court in<br>wellington<br>the personal individual needs court in<br>masterton<br>the family violence intervention court<br>in gisborne<br>and the alcohol and other drug treatment<br>courts in waitakere<br>and auckland there are sexual violence<br>trial courts in auckland and whangarei<br>a criminal procedure mentally impaired<br>persons caught<br>in auckland and most recently<br>a young adult list court has been<br>the district court has an active<br>and deals with 121 000 matters<br>per annum specialist courts<br>deal with a relatively small percentage<br>of the overall criminal caseload<br>and tend to be resource intensive<br>however specialist courts are recognised<br>as centers of excellence<br>for best practice in the criminal<br>jurisdiction<br>to improve access to justice for all<br>people who are served<br>by our court the leadership of the<br>district court intends to develop a<br>model<br>that identifies the best practice<br>lessons from those specialist courts<br>and incorporate them into the mainstream<br>to the extent that is practicable<br>the intention being that the maximum<br>number of people<br>should benefit from the best practice<br>lessons that have been developed in our<br>now i want to address what it is that we<br>i've talked about the cause for change<br>i have outlined the district court's<br>response so far<br>particularly through solution-focused<br>judging<br>do we continue with a proliferation of<br>specialist courts that deal with<br>discrete issues dotted unevenly around<br>the country<br>and representing a small percentage of<br>the 37 000 active criminal matters<br>that constitute our current criminal<br>caseload<br>or do we take a broader more integrated<br>approach<br>it has become increasingly clear that<br>the way ahead<br>is to build a mainstream model on the<br>foundation provided by specialist<br>courts this will allow us to integrate<br>those best practices throughout the<br>district court<br>approaches that teach us about the value<br>of whanau<br>hapu ewi and wider community involvement<br>and the power of tikanga and fostering<br>rehabilitation<br>and restoring lives resonates<br>as applicable and beneficial for all<br>people<br>of all cultures and of all ethnicities<br>this mainstream approach will be<br>inclusive and designed<br>to increase levels of engagement with<br>all people<br>not just maori and not just defendants<br>but all new zealanders who are affected<br>there are several common features of our<br>solution focus courts that form the<br>building blocks<br>of a mainstream approach these range<br>from<br>inviting the diverse voices of our<br>communities<br>into our courtrooms toning down<br>courtroom formalities encouraging<br>engaged and informed judging practices<br>coordinating systems and community<br>expertise<br>to identify and address the underlying<br>woven through all of this is the<br>incorporation of tekango into court<br>procedure<br>to enhance engagement and inclusion<br>this mainstream model is intended to be<br>a deliberate<br>and comprehensive response to the cause<br>for transformative change<br>to the way that the district court<br>delivers justice in this country<br>we intend to refer to the mainstreaming<br>model<br>as the te aw maruma model<br>this concept is intended to represent<br>a natural extension of what we have done<br>so far<br>in responding to the cause for<br>it should also be seen as a considered<br>and meaningful step<br>towards improving access to justice for<br>i want to turn now to speak specifically<br>about the hamilton district court<br>and in doing so i want to acknowledge<br>the fact that we have a large<br>representation<br>present tonight from the district court<br>bench<br>in hamilton we have a large<br>representation of the profession<br>and we have a large representation of<br>the academic faculty in this area<br>as well as uh representation from<br>tainui<br>so what i'm about to say may be of some<br>interest<br>an addiction treatment court is<br>something the hamilton community has<br>been calling for<br>next year in hamilton with support from<br>government funding for specialist<br>services<br>hamilton's alcohol and other drug<br>treatment court<br>will have a stream in the criminal<br>jurisdiction<br>based on the current model in auckland<br>but significantly there will be a new<br>and distinct family court stream that<br>deals with care and protection issues<br>this stream will focus on young mothers<br>with addictions<br>who have or are at risk of having<br>a child removed from their care by<br>tamariki<br>and so have come within the sphere of<br>notably this means the alcohol and<br>other drug treatment court in hamilton<br>will for the first time include<br>participants<br>from both the criminal and family court<br>jurisdictions<br>this expansion of the alcohol and other<br>is primarily about the best interests<br>and welfare of the children<br>involved the fact is that many of the<br>children who come to the state's<br>attention<br>there is more than enough evidence that<br>children who end up in state care<br>go on to have vastly higher<br>children and young people living with<br>parents who are addicts<br>are vulnerable to harm and neglect as<br>well as<br>to falling onto the wrong side of the<br>law<br>the inclusion of a family court stream<br>as part of the aodt<br>court offers a new path for early<br>and better tailored intervention for<br>mothers with underlying addiction issues<br>hamilton district court will also be the<br>first court<br>in aotearoa new zealand where the te<br>al-marama mainstream model<br>we intend to develop this model in a<br>spirit of partnership<br>between the executive local ewe<br>and in conjunction with out of diverse<br>multicultural communities<br>non-governmental organizations service<br>providers<br>and with the support of the ministry of<br>justice and other cross-sector<br>agencies the te al-marama mainstream<br>model will recognise that the<br>communities<br>in each court location are different<br>a one-size-fits-all approach will not<br>work<br>and flexibility will be necessary to<br>adapt processes in a way<br>that best reflects the needs and special<br>characteristics of individual<br>communities<br>the taomarama model will be designed to<br>draw on<br>existing resources within each community<br>and it will also attempt to invite the<br>strengths<br>of each community into the courtroom<br>for the benefit of those who are<br>affected by the business of the court<br>and ultimately for the benefit of the<br>our long-term intention is to spread the<br>tao matama mainstream model<br>across all of our district courts from<br>kaitaia<br>to invercargill i acknowledge<br>that the district court cannot do this<br>alone nor in isolation<br>i look forward to navigating this<br>pathway<br>alongside ewe alongside the wider<br>communities that we serve<br>and with the support of the executive<br>the ministry of justice<br>and the other relevant cross-sector<br>agencies<br>in conclusion i emphasise that none of<br>the concepts and approaches<br>encapsulated in the te al marama model<br>the many components have already been<br>trialled in various forms<br>and specialist solution focus courts<br>over many years<br>and they have been found to be both<br>what is different is the intention<br>to develop the model in partnership with<br>local ewe<br>and alongside local communities to bring<br>the strength of the community<br>taking the lessons our specialist courts<br>offer about best practice<br>and targeted evidence-based responses<br>and applying them across the whole of<br>the district court to the point<br>they are normalized is a logical next<br>step<br>the intention of the tao mahama model is<br>to improve access to justice<br>and enhance outcomes for those who are<br>this is intended to result in judges<br>being presented<br>with the best available information to<br>enable well-informed decisions to be<br>made that achieve<br>fair and appropriate outcomes<br>this is all intended to build confidence<br>in the court process<br>and in the rule of law<br>within the communities we serve and<br>ultimately<br>this pathway towards tel marumo is clear<br>to end this address i'm reminded of one<br>of my grandfather's favorite wakatoki<br>hiti te mogoroa kahikatea<br>kahina which translates as<br>even the smallest insect the borah<br>the boro grub can fell the tallest tree<br>in the forest<br>to achieve a great feat time<br>perseverance and commitment<br>are necessary requirements<br>i commend this approach to all of us in<br>our collective endeavor<br>to reimagine the district court as a<br>place where all people can come<br>to seek justice regardless of their<br>means<br>or abilities regardless of their culture<br>or ethnicity regardless<br>and i commend this approach to all of us<br>to make this shared<br>my<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
