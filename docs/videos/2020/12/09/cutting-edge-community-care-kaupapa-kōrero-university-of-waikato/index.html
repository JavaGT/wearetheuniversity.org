where we're going<br>to explore the university of waikato's<br>role in pursuing<br>health research and in reimagining<br>health care training for new zealand<br>our speakers tonight are professor roger<br>strasser dr tony o'brien<br>dr waikara moana waitaki dr joe hicks<br>and professor ross lawrenson i'll<br>introduce each more fulsomely<br>when they have their turn to speak and<br>we'll hear from them as they<br>share their own health related research<br>as well as a range of perspectives on<br>issues related to regional health care<br>now these talks are an opportunity for<br>our researchers to share<br>their interests and their aspirations<br>and also<br>for our audience to ask whatever<br>questions you feel like<br>and the way that happens is through<br>slido so<br>if you have a smartphone or other smart<br>device<br>um we've trained you very well with<br>kovid we're all very<br>familiar with qr codes now this one will<br>not only tell the government where<br>you're sitting<br>it will also allow you to ask a question<br>so it'll fire up the slido app you can<br>type in whatever question you like<br>and then they will get beamed by some<br>magical process to my ipad<br>when we get to the q a session so at any<br>point you can<br>beam in and ask a question<br>now each of our panelists tonight has<br>just 10 minutes<br>which is hardly any time at all given<br>the interest of of what they can talk<br>about<br>and they're going to give an overview of<br>their particular area which ranges<br>across<br>across a wide range of health care<br>related research topics<br>so without further ado you're not here<br>to hear from me you're here to hear from<br>them<br>so i'll introduce professor roger<br>strasser<br>professor strasser is a professor of<br>rural health<br>at tehuataki wyoda of health<br>professor strasser joined the university<br>in may of this year it's been an<br>auspicious year for many people<br>before that he was founding dean and ceo<br>of the northern ontario school of<br>medicine in canada<br>and he has an international reputation<br>for developing strategies to train<br>health care professionals in and for<br>rural communities<br>professor strasser thank you<br>thank you brony i'm the one who's the<br>odd one out i'm not actually going to<br>use slides i'm just going to<br>talk to you but thank you for the<br>introduction and i must say it's<br>absolutely wonderful<br>to be here in person talking with you<br>because<br>the previous versions that were planned<br>for this event i was going to join you<br>by<br>zoom so great to great to be here<br>now for this short talk i'm drawing<br>inspiration<br>from uh albert einstein<br>so einstein defined insanity<br>as doing the same thing over and over<br>and expecting a different result<br>my focus is on the health and health<br>care of people living in<br>remote and rural communities so i want<br>you to just stop and think for a minute<br>think about over 20 percent<br>of the population living in remote and<br>rural communities indigenous people<br>and the health status of these people is<br>worse than the<br>than the general population<br>and they have less access to health care<br>than the general population<br>so just think about that now i'm betting<br>that as you think about that you're<br>thinking about new zealand<br>and the picture that i painted is true<br>for new zealand but it's also true for<br>canada<br>so i'm going to start with a story about<br>canada<br>back in 2002 my wife professor sarah<br>strasser who's here she's now the<br>the dean of the taiwaki waiara school of<br>health you want to stand up sir and take<br>so back in 2002 sarah and i and our five<br>children<br>moved from australia to canada so we<br>both have a background as rural general<br>practitioners in australia and<br>found our way into academic medicine i<br>was the first professor of rural health<br>in australia and we moved to canada to<br>northern ontario in canada to join<br>people in northern ontario to establish<br>a new<br>medical school the northern ontario<br>school of medicine on knossom<br>so in 2000 2001 the people of northern<br>ontario the communities right across<br>northern ontario<br>had had been advocating had been saying<br>if we're ever going to have enough<br>doctors and other health professionals<br>if we're<br>ever going to improve the health of the<br>people of northern ontario we need our<br>own standalone<br>northern ontario school of medicine and<br>the ontario government actually brought<br>that proposition<br>so sarah and i and our five kids went<br>over to<br>to northern ontario to canada uh to join<br>others in establishing<br>and from what i've said you can see that<br>the northern ontario school of medicine<br>was established from the beginning with<br>an explicit<br>social accountability mandate so that's<br>a commitment to be responsive to the<br>health needs<br>of the the people and the communities of<br>northern ontario with a focus on<br>improving the health<br>of the people of northern ontario so we<br>knew from research evidence<br>that the three factors most strongly<br>associated with going into rural<br>practice<br>after education and training are first a<br>rural upbringing that's having grown up<br>in a rural area<br>the second factor associated with going<br>into rural practice is<br>is clinical and educational experiences<br>in the rural setting as part of<br>undergraduate education so rural<br>clinical experience and the third factor<br>is after graduation<br>training that prepares the graduate to<br>to work as a rural practitioner<br>so that provided the basis for us to<br>develop the life cycle concept or the<br>or the facilitated career pathway in<br>northern ontario starting<br>in high schools actually in indigenous<br>communities even in the in the primary<br>schools<br>encouraging young people to see a future<br>for themselves that might include<br>health care uh and motivating them to<br>study meds<br>to study in high school and make it to<br>university and into to medicine<br>the selection admissions process for<br>northern ontario school of medicine<br>favors applicants from northern ontario<br>and then the most of the clinical<br>education occurs in the communities of<br>northern ontario<br>then there's postgraduate training for<br>the for general practice and disciplines<br>in medicine and the continuing education<br>professional development graduate<br>studies so you can see that's<br>the entire life cycle of cradle to grave<br>shall we say<br>of a rural practitioner or a medical<br>practitioner<br>in northern ontario<br>distributed community engaged learning<br>is the distinctive model of medical<br>education and health research that we<br>developed<br>in northern ontario so distributed<br>distributed means over 90 sites nine<br>zero sites where our students and our<br>trainees and our<br>other learners might undertake part of<br>their clinical learning<br>so those sites had to be connected<br>electronically both in real time and<br>asynchronously<br>and we have an extensive digital library<br>service which means if you have the<br>internet you have access to educational<br>resources and information<br>pretty much the same as if you're in the<br>big city like in a teaching hospital<br>environment but the centerpiece of<br>distributed<br>community engaged learning is community<br>engagement the active participation of<br>communities<br>in the development and the delivery of<br>the education programs<br>a a key feature of of this program<br>is the principal clinical year this is<br>the year when the medical students make<br>the transition from in classroom<br>learners to clinicians<br>and in northern ontario the medical<br>students leave the two<br>cities the university cities and they go<br>to one of 15<br>other communities in northern ontario<br>and they live in the community for the<br>whole academic year and they're based in<br>general practice<br>so you could say the curriculum walks<br>through the door like the first patient<br>might be a child that's pediatrics the<br>next patient might be pregnant that's<br>obstetrics<br>the next patient might have a surgical<br>problem<br>the learning outcomes for that year in<br>the six core clinical disciplines<br>are just the same as in the other<br>medical schools but rather than<br>doing block rotations in internal<br>medicine and in surgery and pediatrics<br>in the teaching hospital<br>the students are learning their core<br>clinical medicine from the community<br>general practice perspective so this<br>model is known as a longitudinal<br>integrated clerkship<br>and northern ontario school of medicine<br>is the first medical school in the world<br>where all of the students undertake a<br>longitudinal integrated clerkship<br>this is as you can see a real example of<br>immune music immersive community<br>engaged education the students are<br>living and learning<br>in the communities where you expect them<br>to to provide service<br>into the future this is really learning<br>in context<br>so what are the outcomes well the school<br>opened officially in 2005<br>so 15 years later we can say<br>that 92 of the medical students have<br>grown up in northern ontario<br>the other eight percent come from remote<br>and rural parts of the rest of canada<br>very different class profile from the<br>other medical schools in ontario and in<br>in canada the the feedback from the<br>students is very positive about their<br>experience so<br>i i think one example from one of the<br>students<br>uh probably sums it up you don't know it<br>until you live it you don't know it<br>until you live it<br>and so in a way it's not surprising that<br>62<br>of the graduates have chosen to train in<br>general practice mostly rural<br>general practice that's almost double<br>the national average for canada going<br>into general practice<br>33 have chosen other general specialties<br>general internal medicine general<br>surgery pediatrics<br>which leaves five percent if you're<br>doing the maths in your head<br>so that five percent have gone into<br>sub-specialties like dermatology<br>radiation oncology<br>neurology and that five percent is<br>important to us in northern ontario for<br>two reasons the first is we need the<br>subspecialists in to provide care in<br>northern ontario<br>they have to go elsewhere for their<br>training but they're coming back<br>but the other is that that it shows<br>that the northern ontario school of<br>medicine produces high quality doctors<br>who are competitive to match to these<br>very competitive training programs in<br>the sub<br>specialties and so that was something<br>that was important to us<br>as i mentioned there's training for<br>general practice and other medical<br>uh specialties in in northern ontario<br>and if you look at the graduates who did<br>their undergraduate and their<br>postgraduate training in northern<br>ontario<br>94 of them are practicing in northern<br>ontario<br>94 percent and that includes in the<br>small communities<br>so talking about small communities we<br>did a study a few years ago now looking<br>at small communities that before<br>the school came along they were really<br>struggling to maintain medical services<br>they had between them eight communities<br>they had thirty three<br>zero full-time equivalent vacancies<br>at the time of the study they had one<br>vacancy<br>they had moved from being in crisis mode<br>trying to fill gaps next week and<br>next month to planning ahead and they<br>were spending less money<br>on recruitment and speaking about money<br>we also<br>have done studies looking at the<br>economic impact of northern ontario<br>school of medicine<br>on northern ontario and have shown<br>that um there's a really substantial<br>return on investment<br>for the government with uh with the with<br>the school<br>so to give an example in 2016-2017<br>the budget of the school that's the<br>taxpayers money was 43 million dollars<br>and the level of new economic activity<br>in northern ontario was something over<br>120<br>million dollars and this economic<br>benefit flows through<br>uh to the small communities not just the<br>larger<br>larger centers so this was very<br>important we also looked at the<br>at the social impact and and there was a<br>sense really<br>of of community empowerment summed up by<br>the phrase<br>if we can do a successful medical school<br>we can do anything<br>so that's northern ontario that's canada<br>let's come back now to<br>new zealand and here we are in new<br>zealand as i painted the picture before<br>you know people living in remote rural<br>maori pacific communities<br>poor poorer health status less access to<br>to health care there are two medical<br>schools here in new zealand<br>who are who are doing the same thing<br>over and over<br>and they produce excellent doctors<br>comparable with doctors produced by<br>medical schools anywhere in the world<br>but unfortunately only about 20 of them<br>choose general practice as their career<br>direction and very few choose to serve<br>the people living in remote rural maori<br>and pacific<br>communities in fact<br>new zealand is very much dependent on<br>doctors who've trained outside<br>new zealand international medical<br>graduates so<br>just to talk about this year 2020 of the<br>161<br>new general practitioners in in new<br>zealand<br>almost half 44 are international medical<br>graduates<br>and there's quite a turnover so last<br>year 2019 there were<br>521 new new zealand medical graduates<br>and 102 new zealand medical graduates<br>left practice were no longer practicing<br>in new zealand now some of them were<br>retirements but<br>many were actually doctors younger<br>doctors who went to other countries to<br>pursue training<br>and their careers so we were left with<br>that's<br>a 102 is about 20 percent so we're<br>left with 100 419 new zealand medical<br>graduates there were comings and goings<br>of<br>international medical graduates as well<br>which which was added up to a net gain<br>of 313<br>international medical graduates so<br>putting all this together in terms of<br>supply of medical workforce<br>new zealand has a problem<br>so what what's to be done about this<br>well it won't surprise you to hear that<br>the solution that i would suggest is a<br>fresh start<br>is something new and different is a<br>socially accountable<br>community engaged medical school drawing<br>on the experience in northern ontario<br>so just to put this together the the the<br>canada and the new zealand<br>story and back to einstein i'm sure that<br>albert einstein would be very pleased to<br>know that the university of waikato<br>is seeking to establish a new and<br>different medical school that produces<br>doctors who have the skills and the<br>commitment to provide<br>care for the people<br>in most in need people living in remote<br>rural maori<br>and pacific communities thank you<br>thank you roger our next speaker tonight<br>is dr tony o'brien who's associate<br>professor of mental health nursing<br>dr brian's had a career in mental health<br>nursing spanning nearly five decades so<br>you wouldn't think it to look at him<br>his many research contributions have led<br>to changes in nursing practice as well<br>as police operational guidelines in<br>mental health emergencies<br>and this year he was made an officer of<br>the new zealand order of merit in the<br>thanks brian and thanks roger for your<br>sorry yep yeah um<br>presentation and um great to hear about<br>um<br>the the model of clinical practice in<br>that final year and i think that's<br>something that we're going to<br>take forward into our nursing program<br>here at waikato<br>um can i just say thanks to bryony for<br>organizing the evening and for you<br>people<br>coming along on a bit of a rainy night i<br>hope you find us worthwhile<br>um i'm going to give you a little bit of<br>how we see research<br>in the nursing program at the university<br>of waikato<br>so the nursing program as you know is<br>very new we've only just got<br>approval to run the program we're<br>planning to start<br>we are going to start in march next year<br>with their first intake of<br>40 graduates so it's a very big thing<br>for me<br>it's a very big thing for the university<br>it's a very big thing for the region in<br>terms of you know a new nursing program<br>the first one in new zealand for 20<br>years<br>um now when i say we the we<br>at the moment apart from the people at<br>the university who've worked with us to<br>get this established myself<br>and professor matthew parsons and<br>cheryl attifold chris baker at waikato<br>dhb we've been the kind of development<br>team over the last year<br>our work in the last year has been<br>around developing<br>the undergraduate program postgraduate<br>program and<br>if i'm quite honest we really haven't<br>had a chance to say<br>what about research how are we going to<br>develop a research<br>program and strategy we've talked about<br>it and obviously for<br>a university-based nursing program<br>especially postgraduate<br>that has to be underpinned by research<br>and the program has to be staffed by<br>nurses who are active researchers so<br>it's definitely there<br>on our agenda both matthew and i have<br>backgrounds in research matthew<br>especially<br>and we'll be bringing that in but we've<br>got we've got to kind of work up<br>our model of how we're going to develop<br>research within the university of<br>waikato so i'll go through my brief<br>presentation here and<br>i like listening to roger's kind of<br>story about<br>northern ontario and i'm going to be a<br>little bit indulged in to give you my<br>story about<br>research and nursing and how that's<br>brought me to where i am now and where i<br>see that going<br>try pushing some randomly see what<br>i think it's that one right there ah<br>so um what i've done here is i've taken<br>from our curriculum documents and the<br>discussions that i've had with um<br>chris and cheryl at the dhb with matthew<br>some of the underpinning principles that<br>will<br>support research in relation to our<br>nursing program<br>and they are a commitment to territory<br>or waitangi that's been very strong in<br>our development so far<br>equity and healthcare that's a very big<br>part of<br>our nursing program here we're not here<br>just to do the same thing as other<br>programs are doing<br>we're here to make a difference and we<br>want to be held to that<br>as a measure of how well we're doing we<br>don't want to be measured by<br>just the number of graduates we do want<br>to be measured by that but<br>we want to be measured by what<br>difference do we make to health care in<br>the waikato and midlands region<br>we know there are inequities in health<br>care we know there are unequal outcomes<br>we know which populations they affect<br>and we want to make an impact of that<br>through through this program population<br>health is a big focus<br>closely related to equity in health care<br>consumer engagement<br>we're not about being experts telling<br>consumers what they need we want to<br>listen to consumers<br>and help them develop solutions to the<br>problems that the health problems they<br>have<br>we want to be engaged with the sector<br>that's been a big part of how we've<br>developed our program so far<br>we've been very engaged with both the<br>dhb and the primary care sector<br>around what do they want out of these<br>graduates what do they want in the<br>nursing workforce what do they want<br>that's different<br>to what they're currently getting and<br>we've tried to work hard on<br>building that into the design of our<br>curriculum and we'll work hard in<br>building that into the delivery of the<br>program we're also about<br>research that translates into practice<br>we don't want research that<br>um just generates outputs we do want<br>that obviously in terms of<br>publication we want to put our work out<br>there but we want<br>research that will make a difference to<br>so some of the areas we've talked about<br>so far<br>are to do research that looks at<br>evaluating<br>the nursing programs at at the<br>university of waikato so we've got the<br>undergraduate program right through the<br>phd<br>and we want to run alongside those<br>programs evaluation research that looks<br>at<br>how we're doing an educational research<br>that looks at how we're doing<br>it from an educational perspective<br>within our honours and phd<br>engage students in research that's<br>aligned to health service<br>priorities both dhb and primary care<br>priorities<br>they're population priorities too but<br>we're particularly wanting<br>to engage with the dhb around what their<br>priorities for<br>service development and services are<br>phd program um<br>a research outputs by publication that's<br>and we also want to contribute to and<br>build interdisciplinary research with<br>our colleagues here at the university of<br>waikato<br>who i'm meeting more of every day and<br>even in terms of the people that<br>i'm working most closely with roger and<br>sarah in particular in the<br>school of nursing orders school of<br>health um<br>you know we haven't got to the point yet<br>of looking at how we're going to work in<br>um interdisciplinary teams but that's<br>that's something that's on our agenda<br>so i'm going to just give you a little a<br>brief outline of<br>some of the mental health research that<br>i've particularly<br>been involved in so far and i've<br>identified three areas<br>now this doesn't come as a kind of a<br>program that<br>i've built up is anybody tracking the<br>time<br>long yeah how am i doing<br>another four minutes great okay um<br>so there's three areas that um<br>i've been particularly involved in<br>they're not the only areas but they're<br>the areas that um<br>i think have been the most important for<br>me<br>one is the physical health of people<br>with mental illness<br>some of you will know about the um<br>equally well initiative that's<br>um is sponsored by topo the<br>national workforce and research center<br>and<br>within equally well there's been a very<br>big focus on<br>the health inequities experienced by<br>people with mental illness<br>to put it very bluntly people with<br>severe mental illness<br>have a reduced life expectancy of about<br>20 years<br>and there's a lot of reasons for that i<br>won't go into the<br>reasons all the reasons um<br>but it's obviously an area where health<br>practitioners need to<br>be aware of to make a difference from a<br>mental health nursing perspective<br>the area that i'm particularly aware of<br>is<br>the the work that mental health nurses<br>can potentially do<br>around helping people with mental<br>illness<br>improve their physical health care or<br>their physical health status<br>and there are things that mental health<br>nurses can do that don't always do<br>what i would like to see happen in our<br>program here is that those<br>areas of practice are highlighted so<br>that<br>the nurses that we produce will be<br>taking that knowledge into their<br>practice<br>one of the areas there is around the<br>side effects of psychotropic medications<br>um which contribute to metabolic<br>syndrome which in turn reduces life<br>expectancy and leads to a much higher<br>incidence of stroke and cardiovascular<br>disease so<br>it's very clear-cut issues experienced<br>by people with<br>um mental illnesses not just severe<br>mental illness it's also mental illness<br>and primary care depression and other<br>mental illnesses that also<br>carry worse physical health outcomes<br>um something that's mentioned on the<br>introduction there was um<br>police involvement in mental health<br>emergencies so a little bit of a story<br>about that<br>in 2008 um the police in new zealand<br>um made the decision to roll out tasers<br>into the<br>um police forces they had a trial<br>in 2009 i think it was<br>and at the time i was involved with the<br>college of mental health nurses i was<br>the president at the time<br>and i read in the newspaper that the<br>police were going to<br>introduce the use of tasers in<br>frontline policing and the police<br>identified three<br>groups that would be um the subject of<br>taser use and one was people<br>in mental health emergencies and i saw<br>that and i thought<br>you can't do this you know like that is<br>just not the way for police to function<br>and i thought we as a as a professional<br>group mental health nurses<br>we can't just sit back and let this<br>i did something that i wouldn't do these<br>days um i rang<br>tv3 and said to them hey um i've got<br>something<br>that i want to say to you about that and<br>um<br>they said okay well we'll organize um<br>you know a camera or whatever and i said<br>okay and they said where's your office<br>and um<br>within about half an hour or an hour or<br>so they were there<br>and of course these days um you can't<br>bring<br>media into a university just like that<br>yeah i mean you've got it's got to be<br>whatever<br>um so anyway that um they they came<br>and they they ran the story i was on the<br>news that night and the um<br>um on the um six o'clock news or<br>whatever<br>and then i wrote a couple of op-eds for<br>the listener and the new zealand herald<br>and got myself very unpopular with the<br>police<br>and i was quite happy to do that because<br>as far as i was concerned there was a<br>really<br>important point that was being<br>overlooked there through the police's<br>credit they really picked up on that<br>they and i don't claim credit for all of<br>this but um they now have a<br>um a special unit within the police that<br>looks at mental health response and how<br>they<br>how they manage that they take it very<br>seriously<br>they they do have their issues around<br>mental health<br>but they've really gone out of their way<br>to kind of try and do something about it<br>they did change their guidelines for the<br>use of tasers to take out that<br>contentious<br>statement about mental health<br>emergencies um<br>so i kind of felt as though you know<br>that was a good example of advocacy<br>and um and kind of making a difference<br>um<br>by responding to something that was<br>going on that leads to research which<br>i'll talk about shortly<br>the third area that um i'm bringing with<br>me into the university here is around<br>the use of advanced directives and<br>mental health services a little bit<br>different to advance care planning which<br>you may be<br>used to hearing about in relation to<br>end-of-life care and palliative care<br>that sort of thing<br>these are instruments which allow people<br>to state their preferences<br>for health care and mental health<br>emergencies<br>when they may be unable to<br>articulate their preferences and<br>expectations at the time um<br>one minute okay so this will be really<br>super fast<br>so i won't actually read this out i've<br>talked about the main ones um<br>i probably i'll just highlight um what<br>happened with the<br>taser research so the police<br>published on their website all the case<br>reports of the use of tasers in the<br>rollout year of<br>2009 or 10.<br>and we captured them off the website and<br>then<br>extracted all the data and did some<br>analysis and found that the police<br>if they brought a taser into<br>a mental health crisis they were two and<br>a half times more likely to use it<br>than they were if they brought a taser<br>into a normal<br>criminal arrest situation so there was a<br>very<br>kind of good statistical um piece of<br>evidence around<br>what the police need to be aware of in<br>terms of what's driving that use of<br>tasers we didn't think it was um you<br>know situational variables like risk or<br>threat it was more about<br>perception of mental illness so at least<br>we thought that was quite a<br>um significant part of of that one of<br>the other things we looked at a little<br>bit where we couldn't do much<br>as much analysis of because we didn't<br>have good enough data was in terms of<br>ethnicity there's definitely an issue<br>there as well so i'm still looking at<br>that issue more generally um<br>as part of a master group that's looking<br>at police<br>community response to people in mental<br>distress and and<br>that's relatively early work gets in the<br>second year um<br>but that's ongoing so look that's me um<br>it feels like a little bit of a<br>breathless run through i hope it's um<br>useful to you and interesting to you<br>obviously you can put questions through<br>the um app and i'll<br>be happy to discuss those at the end of<br>thank you<br>thank you tony i always feel a bit<br>brutish hurrying people along because<br>everybody's so interesting but then the<br>next person is going to be interesting<br>too so we just have to keep things<br>moving<br>our next speaker is doctor waikira moana<br>waitaki who is senior lecturer<br>at tapuinanga the faculty of marine<br>industrial studies<br>dr waitaki is the president of the new<br>zealand psychological society<br>and is a registered clinical<br>psychologist she's a member of<br>he payaka torturer the maori<br>psychologist network and she's also a<br>member of the suicide prevention<br>office maori advisory group and the<br>australian medical council aboriginal<br>and mari advisory group<br>thank you<br>my heart started thumping as soon as she<br>um kia ora thank you for the<br>introduction and thank you to the other<br>manufacture<br>um<br>so i have notes so if i read<br>and then kind of wander off a bit but i<br>am timing myself<br>it turns out that i am short by a couple<br>of minutes<br>which is kind of good um so in keeping<br>with the kaupapa<br>of the evening i would like to offer<br>some insights into what i consider<br>not just my own personal opinion some of<br>it is though<br>to be the optimal conditions for<br>developing cutting edge community care<br>and selecting the research projects i'm<br>involved with it was a little bit like<br>choosing the player of the day each<br>project is valuable for their<br>contributions to health and well-being<br>however the core features of the<br>projects<br>must be the mataranga maori and the<br>collective nature of the teams<br>and the communities of interest so i'll<br>come back to this picture<br>this is<br>so this is the central plateau<br>i was driving through there one day with<br>a group of friends coming back for some<br>research<br>data collection and we were regularly<br>doing well-being corridor on facebook<br>live<br>and we'd kind of got a bit too tired to<br>do the corridor so we set in the car<br>on our drive we decided that we would<br>just call it all<br>in the car um and so we did this big<br>spiel about keeping well during covered<br>while we were in the car and then<br>stopped along the side of the road and<br>took a photo<br>it's quite relevant for the kaupapa that<br>i'm<br>bringing today which is<br>these are the four projects that i've<br>chosen the embrace of our ancestors<br>reimagining and recontextualizing<br>materanga maori in psychology so it was<br>kind of cool to have this reimagining<br>and re-conceptualizing in this this<br>kaupapa<br>this image on the left hand side<br>is an image that my colleague and i<br>developed over the last<br>year and a half and we've been using it<br>a lot lately<br>there it's a well-being image it's fitsy<br>and there are six dimensions of<br>well-being that i'll i'll talk about<br>and it's just a really cool picture i<br>thought it'd be quite nice<br>um so how can um<br>i do want to want to focus on people and<br>i do want to focus on the shared<br>aspirations that our teams bring<br>to the to our projects<br>so how can training health care training<br>benefit from<br>waikato's world-leading medical research<br>and i wondered<br>how could i fit into the term medical i<br>think that health is interrelated<br>context informed and environmentally<br>influenced<br>in this understanding mata rangamati<br>flourishes and mighty flourish<br>so i offer four projects currently<br>underway that provide<br>core content for healthcare education<br>research and practice<br>is unique because it recognises the need<br>to embed mataranga maori into all phases<br>of a research project<br>i'd like to acknowledge professor ellen<br>hogg and all the team members for their<br>commitment to building and sustaining<br>relationships with maori<br>having the hard conversations being<br>willing to be flexible and seeing the<br>potential of each part of the research<br>to understand mighty well-being goes<br>back to the past<br>to uncover explore debate and cherish<br>those elements of our history that are<br>on the verge of being lost<br>well-being requires regeneration and<br>reclamation<br>each part of this project is a joy from<br>finding out about the science of<br>building power<br>to the reasons particular trees were<br>used and why they were built in the<br>first place<br>and this means that we have another<br>repository of knowledge<br>that can be added to our understanding<br>our understandings of well-being<br>um what's really exciting for me um<br>um so i'm like a psychologist and why am<br>i doing an archaeology project<br>and it's really because i wanted to<br>impress my son actually just as<br>simple as that my son's a scientist and<br>i thought i can talk to him about this<br>and he has come out on a<br>on a little bit of a like a shuffle and<br>a dig in a scrape around<br>and he's completely uninterested in the<br>mataranga maori part<br>and but the the beauty of the project is<br>that it really does<br>blend these two knowledge forms so<br>archaeology radiocarbon dating<br>wiggle matching technique which i'll<br>just say is this<br>incredibly um amazing<br>technique that does fine-tune the<br>character the date of a piece of wood<br>down to plus or minus four years<br>and so rather than a hundred year time<br>span which is a couple of generations<br>we can know that um the trees were<br>failed at a particular time<br>and we know um from records who<br>was there what kind of conversations<br>were happening what were people doing<br>and that that blending infusion of<br>matarangamati is<br>is really important to the project and<br>it's important to maori and it's<br>important to<br>my understandings of<br>of wellbeing and the fact that we are<br>looking at<br>korero and whakapapa puranko<br>the way that we hold knowledge the way<br>that we transmit knowledge<br>is something that i'm i'm really keen to<br>use to inform psychology<br>so the second project and possibly<br>my favorite is it's an examination of<br>mataranga maori in relation to<br>well-being and psychology<br>and so from the very early days of maya<br>there's a story i've told it's the same<br>song sheet<br>training in psychology is to really be<br>at odds with my mighty cultural identity<br>and going through training showed me<br>that there was just so much<br>more that we weren't learning that we<br>weren't being taught and yet<br>maori as we know disproportionately<br>affected across all of our health<br>statistics and so when our psychologists<br>go through training they come out<br>and they then incorporate the maori the<br>mataranga maori that they either grew up<br>with<br>or that they knew would actually work in<br>some way<br>with their clients and so my question<br>was is what is that knowledge you know<br>when you<br>are trained in a particular way and you<br>then go and you learn a whole new set of<br>knowledge<br>or you bring forth that knowledge what<br>is it about that knowledge<br>and so we're theorizing that knowledge<br>um<br>and the goal is to develop our<br>really i guess it's to develop our own<br>psychology if that's even the right word<br>it's psychology is even the right word<br>and so this is a group of maori<br>psychologists and students<br>and so in reimagining a healthcare model<br>this<br>is probably the first of its kind<br>weekend wananga where we came together<br>and we taught<br>each other mata ranga maori in relation<br>to psychology and in relation to<br>well-being<br>and it was a quite an inspiring<br>occasion and has then led on to the<br>development of our<br>so in thinking about well-being pathways<br>um<br>the six that we have here is language<br>creative arts spirituality genealogy<br>family and environment<br>and so from a systematic review of the<br>literature and co-design wananga with<br>maori colleagues<br>and experts we came up with this model<br>and it really looks at the way that we<br>consider what wellbeing looks like<br>and so if um say i want<br>and the center piece is about our modi<br>so the way that we flourish or our life<br>essence and so if our life essence is<br>not<br>flourishing something has caused that to<br>happen there's an environmental<br>influence there that's happened and so<br>we're wanting to understand while<br>you react to your environment and your<br>environment reacts to you so we're<br>understanding that relationality<br>these images we developed during the<br>covert period<br>it became really apparent to us that<br>during covert uh<br>pretty much this 25th of march<br>that there was not enough maori<br>psychosocial material<br>available to help maori deal with the<br>pandemic<br>and so we set about creating some<br>resources and they were<br>focused on these dimensions and so what<br>i did was i looked at what was happening<br>in social media<br>the news and across the country how were<br>maori responding to<br>the covert pandemic and across each of<br>the<br>things that i analyzed they either hit<br>language<br>creative arts spirituality waiduatanga<br>whakapapa<br>family and environment and i thought<br>these are just some examples of the<br>whakapapa corridor that we<br>ran really ran them during the second<br>wave<br>so we ran these three nights a week and<br>we<br>we being a group of mighty psychologists<br>half of us were the same ones each time<br>maybe we were like repeating repeating<br>that<br>and we just talked about some of the<br>topical issues that we felt were<br>relevant for maori<br>and it was targeted at consumers<br>we weren't interested in having<br>conversations with ourselves<br>so we talked about time and aroha we<br>talked about rangatahi navigating covert<br>we had psychologists in australia so we<br>talked about all these<br>what we felt were the core issues for<br>maori<br>geez okay and we did this<br>we did more pictures developed some<br>models um<br>the i just want to mention this project<br>here which is our<br>this is our hapu order maori wellbeing<br>project which has started actually<br>started during the covert period<br>again this is deeply embedded in mata<br>ranga maori and i'm just going to say<br>that in the recent<br>weeks we've had some research that's<br>come out that talks about the way maori<br>less likely to receive treatment for<br>diabetes or the way that maori<br>with gestational diabetes are not given<br>options for<br>for treatment and so those are key for<br>us and then the last one<br>which is about to start is we're all<br>working to end<br>racism and oppression<br>i guess this is really about the way<br>that structural racism inequities for<br>maori exist<br>and the things that need to happen the<br>changes that need to happen to address<br>those issues<br>i've run out of time<br>thank you dr wytoki i was chatting<br>earlier today to sonny collings who's<br>the ceo<br>of the health research council hrc and<br>it was quite interesting actually<br>because our conversation<br>really touched upon what we're seeing<br>here tonight which is the whole breadth<br>of what is<br>needed to advance health research in any<br>context let alone um in<br>aotearoa new zealand and and so with<br>that in mind what we're going to see now<br>is is really swinging<br>to the other end of the health research<br>spectrum and the hard out<br>biochemical biomedical research the dr<br>joanna hicks<br>dr joe hicks is a senior lecturer in<br>biological sciences<br>she works at the interface of<br>biochemistry and infectious disease<br>you're fun at dinner parties her<br>research focuses on how bacterial<br>pathogens are able to grow and survive<br>in unique often<br>inhospitable environments and critically<br>evade<br>immune host response host immune<br>responses so how might we overcome<br>antibacterial antibiotic resistance in<br>in our treatments this is an incredibly<br>important aspect to health research<br>thank you all for um being here tonight<br>to to listen to us talk about<br>our research so we present our research<br>a lot at scientific conferences but very<br>rarely do we have the opportunity to<br>present it to such a varied audience so<br>thank you very much for coming along<br>so as my introduction said i'm a<br>biochemist and a molecular biologist<br>so i kind of work at the minuscule<br>end of the scale so we often refer to<br>what we do<br>as working with small volumes of clear<br>liquids because what we work with you<br>cannot see<br>with the naked eye so we kind of um<br>are at this if we go back so if we work<br>at kind of the molecular or like atomic<br>level<br>and so kind of to put that into context<br>i've kind of shown here<br>so i'm showing in with the orange wiggly<br>lines<br>is dna and what dna kind of looks like<br>and then around that is um a<br>protein molecule so this is made up of<br>lots of different atoms<br>and these are the things that keep our<br>cells<br>going so everything that is happening in<br>your body<br>at the moment is driven by these<br>molecules that we can't see<br>so lots of our research is involved in<br>looking at<br>exactly how these kind of protein<br>molecules work<br>um with a focus on infectious disease<br>and what we do at this molecular level<br>can be kind of applied to the cellular<br>level to<br>organ function to um the whole body you<br>know when we're talking about infectious<br>diseases and different bacterial<br>illnesses<br>and obviously that has massive effects<br>for our family and whanau<br>and our communities as well so i started<br>off<br>here at the university of waikato in<br>doing my phd and so my phd with<br>professor vicarcus was looking<br>into tuberculosis and the ability of<br>tuberculosis<br>to kind of persist inside your lungs so<br>you can be exposed to tuberculosis<br>be absolutely fine don't even know<br>you've been exposed to it but you've got<br>this tiny little bacteria hiding out<br>inside your lungs that you know months<br>years decades after exposure can flare<br>up<br>and cause active tb so what we were<br>doing<br>was trying to look at these kind of<br>protein molecules<br>within the bacteria to try and see if we<br>could work out what exactly was causing<br>it<br>to kind of hide out in our lungs<br>and then so post phd i moved to the uk<br>um for three years and i did um a<br>postdoc<br>research project looking at<br>malaria at the university of cambridge<br>and we did kind of took the same<br>approach<br>trying to look at all these different<br>protein molecules that are within the<br>parasite that causes malaria to see if<br>we could find<br>some good targets for anti-malarial<br>drugs<br>so upon return to the university of<br>waikato<br>in early 2015 i was kind of<br>thinking about what i wanted to work on<br>and<br>rather serendipitously i kind of<br>stumbled on this paper about something<br>we've been looking at for a little while<br>and i started doing a little bit of<br>research into the bacteria<br>that causes gonorrhea so this is called<br>nesiria gonorrhea<br>and it turns out that this is a huge<br>problem<br>so antibiotic resistance in this<br>bacteria is a global issue<br>and it's also an issue that's becoming<br>very real here in aotearoa as well<br>so we've kind of gone from a situation<br>where in the 1930s and the 1940s<br>kind of the golden era of antibiotics we<br>could<br>you could get a shot of penicillin and<br>gonorrhea would be cured within four<br>hours but kind of 60 years later<br>gonorrhea has developed resistance to<br>every single antibiotic that has ever<br>been used<br>for its treatment and now we're facing<br>what the media<br>is calling super gonorrhea which<br>basically to us<br>means extensively drug resistant<br>gonorrhea so people<br>in the uk who have got this kind of<br>superbug require hospitalization with<br>four to five days<br>on iv antibiotics for some pretty nasty<br>side effects<br>to clear what was once an easily<br>treatable infection<br>so this kind of believe it or not<br>actually made me quite excited<br>i never ever thought i would ever say<br>that<br>but i became really excited about it<br>because i thought this is kind of a real<br>problem that we can actually start to<br>grapple with and work<br>in the lab so the aim of our research in<br>this project<br>is to determine the molecular details of<br>these key proteins<br>you can kind of think of them as like<br>molecular machines in the cell<br>because if we know what they look like<br>in three dimensions as shown up here<br>we can design chemicals to bind into<br>them<br>and kind of jam them up and stop them<br>from working and if some of these<br>molecules are absolutely essential<br>for the bacteria to grow and survive and<br>infect<br>human cells if we can design something<br>to kind of stick in there and stop it<br>from working<br>we potentially have a new antibiotic<br>so we can we can take this approach to<br>determine the molecular details and<br>design<br>and screen chemicals to bind in these<br>molecules<br>and then we can take these actually into<br>the laboratory<br>and use them to screen against<br>the gonorrhea bacteria and to see if it<br>kills the bacteria<br>and we can also test the ability to<br>affect infect human<br>cells as well so shown in purple down<br>the bottom there is a human cell in<br>three dimensions<br>and the little red blobs on it are the<br>um<br>bacteria that causes gonorrhea and<br>they're stuck to the outside of that<br>human cell about to invade<br>and infect it and you can see on the<br>other picture there you can imagine if<br>you take like a ball<br>and cut it in half in the middle what<br>you're looking at is you've got the<br>human cell around the outside<br>and all those purple dots in the cell<br>are the bacteria<br>that's infected the cell so even if we<br>find some compounds or some chemicals<br>that kind of stop these enzymes from<br>working<br>so if we find something that say for<br>example doesn't necessarily kill the<br>bacteria<br>but if we can prevent it infecting human<br>cells<br>so i kind of wanted to put this into<br>this into this wider context<br>of how because we're talking about<br>community kind of healthcare and i work<br>and how my work<br>at that kind of molecular level<br>can actually help to contribute to<br>addressing sexual health inequities<br>and hopefully better health outcomes so<br>i kind of made this kind of continuum<br>and so i think that to address sexual<br>health inequities<br>it's a collective effect so we need<br>fundamental research into those<br>into sexually transmitted infections and<br>the sort of research that we're doing<br>so we're looking at other projects that<br>look at non-symptomatic infection<br>so certain people with gonorrhea might<br>show no symptoms<br>but they can still transmit the disease<br>to other people which means you know<br>which is a major factor in driving<br>infection and we we need new antibiotics<br>i hope<br>i've got that um that point across today<br>and we also need vaccines as well so<br>vaccines are really good preventatives<br>for the spread of disease<br>and we've got anti-but we need those<br>vaccines to kind of keep our antibiotics<br>that are useful to remain useful<br>and then we also need kind of to we need<br>more<br>sexual health research as well so<br>research into what's driving sexually<br>transmitted infections<br>how they're transmitted through the<br>community is there you know<br>the quality of sexual health services<br>across aotearoa<br>and this relies on sexual health<br>services gps and maori and pacific<br>sexual<br>health services as well and if we<br>combine all of these things in a whole<br>lot more<br>we can actually go about kind of getting<br>some policy change to kind of start<br>addressing these inequities that we see<br>in sexual health<br>across aotearoa and and that<br>in that vein one of the other projects<br>that we kind of like to<br>um to start establishing is using<br>gonorrhea genomics and epidemiology to<br>actually trace<br>um gonorrhea infection so the prime<br>example of this<br>is covert 19. so at the moment they're<br>using whole genome sequencing<br>to identify you know where people have<br>may have got their um<br>that certain strain of covert from and<br>the prime example was just the miq the<br>auckland student who contracted the same<br>virus as the miq defense person and they<br>determined that using whole genome<br>sequencing<br>and so we can use the same sort of<br>techniques with whole genome sequencing<br>to actually look at the spread of<br>gonorrhea across<br>aotearoa and also other sexually<br>transmitted infections<br>and use this with actual data from<br>people<br>about what drives infection and what's<br>causing<br>this um this increase in infections that<br>we're seeing in our communities<br>and so our research is kind of down the<br>more fundamental end of the scale but<br>hopefully we can<br>um contribute to kind of addressing<br>these sexual health inequities<br>and to do this we have um we have<br>funding from the health research council<br>the waikato medical research foundation<br>locally the morris wilkins center<br>and this allows us to to establish<br>collaborations as a biochemist and<br>molecular biologist<br>with sexual health clinicians and maori<br>sexual and health and research services<br>such as tifariki<br>takapo as well so hopefully next time<br>i might be able to actually report on<br>something that we've actually designed<br>some of those chemicals to<br>to bind in those enzymes and we might<br>have tested them in the lab by that<br>point as well<br>thank you very much joe so our last<br>panelist tonight is professor ross<br>laurenson uh press lawrence and<br>professor of population health and he<br>divides his time between the university<br>of waikato and waikato district health<br>board<br>where he is chair of the dhb research<br>advisory committee<br>and president of the waikato<br>postgraduate medical incorporated<br>society<br>he's also a pharmac board member and is<br>active in health services related to<br>cancer diabetes and chronic conditions<br>chris lawrenson<br>thank you very much brownie yes so<br>the lucky last um it's a great pleasure<br>to be here i really<br>there we are there's one in four buttons<br>to go<br>really just want to talk to you about<br>some of the research that we've been<br>doing in the four years since<br>our team moved across to the university<br>of waikato<br>our overview and vision really was that<br>we need to<br>facilitate improved health outcomes in<br>our region<br>through clinical research and i think<br>there's a lot of evidence<br>that organizations that are research<br>active<br>are also have better health outcomes for<br>their patients<br>and as part of that we really wanted to<br>complement the work that our excellent<br>health partners both in primary care but<br>particularly in the<br>in the hospital sector have been doing<br>um and providing support<br>through the university um for the work<br>that they do<br>so our intent was to help those<br>busy clinicians answer some of the<br>research questions that are important to<br>them<br>so to do that we've had a really great<br>team that have come across<br>and we've built up over the last four<br>years of<br>basic scientists mixed with clinicians<br>who are<br>being honorary members of the university<br>who are working in clinical practice but<br>are really interested in supporting our<br>research<br>and you know i would note that you know<br>there's a range of<br>expertise that we need in order to do<br>that research<br>including qualitative researches<br>biostatistics health economics<br>basic sciences as joe was talking about<br>health psychology<br>and health services research um we have<br>been building up our international links<br>both with<br>the uk around our cancer research uh<br>with colleagues in<br>uh australia um sanjiva as uh sunnyvale<br>and<br>colombo who was a phd student here<br>and of course we've still got our<br>colleagues in<br>auckland and otago that we work closely<br>with<br>um the areas that we work in are the<br>areas that are really important to the<br>health board and and to our local<br>communities so<br>number one uh cause of mortality and<br>morbidity is heart disease<br>so we've been really lucky to attract um<br>professor adam<br>algamal as an honorary professor here<br>adam<br>uh was a head of cardiac surgery at<br>king's college in london<br>and came to waikato over 10 years ago<br>now<br>and has really built up a unit that is<br>only second to auckland at the moment in<br>size of<br>in size and capacity and it's growing<br>rapidly in the expertise that they're<br>doing<br>um and alum is particularly an expert in<br>valvular disease<br>which given our rates of rheumatic fever<br>is absolutely crucial<br>the other area as brian mentioned that<br>i've been interested in has been<br>diabetes i've been working in diabetes<br>research for<br>more than 30 years now and that started<br>off here in<br>in the waikato with the waikato regional<br>diabetes service<br>there's more than 25 000 patients in the<br>waikato who have diabetes<br>and are looked after by the service and<br>so the research that they do has been<br>really groundbreaking within new zealand<br>we're very lucky to now the lead<br>researcher there is<br>dr ryan paul who's just got a foxley<br>fellowship through the university<br>and the hrc and he's been working with<br>dr lynn chepoulos<br>who was on tv yesterday with some of her<br>research that<br>moana kindly mentioned we're also<br>working very closely with um<br>jade tamatea who is a maori researcher<br>and endocrinologist at the dhb<br>because as we all know the the<br>type 2 diabetes in particular<br>particularly affects maori<br>and we've recently just put in a another<br>hrc bed<br>in conjunction with colleagues from the<br>university of auckland and university of<br>otago<br>another project that i'm very proud of<br>and has been a<br>fascinating project to be involved in<br>has been our hrc lung cancer project<br>which is coming to its end now<br>on the bottom right there we have the<br>wonderful shimano kasim who's been our<br>project manager there and that was<br>really based around the fact that<br>in the midland region we have a lung<br>cancer register that has been recording<br>the problems of lung cancer for more<br>than 10 years now<br>and my colleagues in the respiratory<br>departments came and<br>said what we need to do is something<br>about earlier diagnosis and particularly<br>a<br>earlier diagnosis for maori<br>and and so i had a chat with my<br>colleague<br>who was at the time at the university of<br>auckland jackie kidd<br>who is a qualitative maori researcher<br>and she said ross what we need is a<br>kaupapa maori co-design project<br>so i said yes jackie whatever you say<br>jackie<br>and away we went and we've been engaging<br>with rural maori communities<br>throughout the midland region been you<br>know a<br>real joy to work with with jackie um<br>we've had<br>great support from brendan hokafitu and<br>maori indigenous studies here<br>uh dr anna ralston from the bay of<br>plenty and dr roberty keenan<br>have led this kopapa maori<br>co-design process where we've been<br>listening to the stories of<br>maori patients around cancer and lung<br>cancer<br>and then helping them design<br>interventions<br>that were suitable for their communities<br>and some of those publications<br>have been coming out recently the other<br>area that we've been working has been in<br>breast cancer<br>waikato was the pilot area for the<br>breast cancer pilot back in the 1990s<br>and at that time we attracted professor<br>ian campbell<br>who is the leading breast surgeon in the<br>country ian set up<br>the breast cancer register here in the<br>waikato<br>and out of that register we've had a<br>number of phd students<br>we had a big hrc project grant<br>and now dr chunwon lao has got a<br>breast cancer fellowship working on<br>metastatic breast cancer with professor<br>campbell and that work is ongoing and<br>it's been very productive<br>we're also interested in bowel cancer as<br>a real theme here<br>but these are the big causes of<br>morbidity and mortality in new zealand<br>here again we've been working<br>with our local clinicians particularly<br>ralph van darlen and judy<br>warren who are the lead clinicians here<br>at waikato but involving<br>on the left there i'm sure lots of<br>people know chris jackson<br>who i was involved with his piper study<br>on bowel cancer and that project has<br>carried on providing some really<br>important information about access for<br>services<br>for patients with bowel cancer tanya<br>blackmore there has been our research<br>fellow on that and tania<br>has recently just got a hrc activation<br>grant<br>to look at some of the work that we've<br>done previously around prostate cancer<br>that project or that work around<br>prostate cancer again i think we've done<br>some of the most<br>important health services research<br>around prostate cancer<br>in new zealand we did that about eight<br>or nine years ago and<br>tiffany schwartz has very kindly come<br>along tonight<br>michael holmes we're very much leading<br>the the need for that research<br>michael's doing a lot of work now on mri<br>and some leading work on<br>the use of mri for diagnosing prostate<br>cancer<br>but we've also been doing work with<br>richard egan<br>from otago and jackie again looking at<br>the supportive care needs for maori men<br>with prostate cancer<br>which was something that we identified<br>was a real gap<br>other opportunities for us to work<br>together there's the midland trauma<br>system i'm an advisor<br>on the research advisory group to this<br>trauma system<br>of associate professor grant christie<br>from university of auckland has the the<br>best data on trauma<br>in new zealand from it's been collecting<br>data from right across the region for<br>the last 10 years<br>and his work has really improved our<br>outcomes from<br>trauma in new zealand and certainly is<br>saving a lot of money one of my passions<br>is around rural health<br>and very lucky to be working with<br>associate professor gary nixon<br>on an hrc project defining what we mean<br>by<br>rural which has always been a challenge<br>very lucky to have jesse whitehead there<br>in the middle<br>who's just finished his phd and as a<br>geographer<br>and has been doing a wonderful job<br>helping us map<br>all of the data to help us define<br>virality<br>my colleague matthew parsons and i set<br>up the institute of healthy aging<br>at the waikato dhb about 10 or 12 years<br>ago<br>so it's great joy to have matthew come<br>with tony into the<br>the university aging<br>population is the big tsunami that is<br>facing the health services at the moment<br>we're going to have a 70 increase in the<br>age<br>population by 2030 and the<br>the health demand that that creates for<br>the health service<br>is crucial so matthew's work on<br>maintaining people<br>out of hospital and in the community is<br>actually a crucial part of that<br>i think the other area that we should<br>probably talk about is health technology<br>we are a leading center for that we've<br>got dr ruth large there is<br>a ed clinician at waikato hospital<br>but she's also the national clinical<br>advisor on telehealth to the ministry<br>and is really passionate about the use<br>of telemedicine<br>and below there we have um uh associated<br>professor amanda oakley<br>who um the waikato may not you may not<br>know this but it's the center<br>world center for tele dermatology um and<br>amanda and<br>marius rydermaker set that up and<br>now you don't go and see your doctor to<br>have your<br>skin lesions diagnosed you have a<br>photograph taken in the clinic<br>and then it gets sent to a radiologist<br>and amanda and her colleagues<br>reporting on legions from all over the<br>world with her tele-dermatology service<br>so that's just a brief view of some of<br>the key things that we're doing at the<br>moment<br>from our point of view health is<br>absolutely crucial to this region<br>and we have something like 40 000 health<br>workers in the region<br>we get over three billion dollars a year<br>comes into the health services<br>so the university really should be in<br>the business of adding value to that<br>business<br>both from the point of view of training<br>and<br>expertise but also the work that we do<br>on research<br>we have the highest proportion and the<br>highest numbers of maori in the<br>in the country in our region and 50 of<br>our population<br>are rural and so there's real<br>opportunities for<br>um doing research uh in the health<br>delivery space around equity<br>um and that's something that we've been<br>doing um on a regular basis<br>so our work has been focusing on the<br>things that really matter to the health<br>services<br>we have been really enjoying working<br>with our colleagues and that's really<br>where we see the opportunities going<br>forward so<br>thank you very much<br>so we have some time now for audience<br>questions which have been<br>coming in throughout the evening um<br>there's a few very specific questions<br>here which i might leave go<br>to have if we have time and i'll start<br>with some of the more general questions<br>and this one is a<br>i'm going to pick this one because it<br>appeals to my particular biases as well<br>um in a world that's trending away from<br>fact<br>which is indeed the case i think you<br>know like anti-vaxxers covet deniers etc<br>how do you plan promoting an evidenced<br>based healthcare mindset and treatment<br>methods<br>and i think there's probably an answer<br>there from each of you so<br>world<br>any one of you just dive on in i i think<br>it's been really interesting around<br>cancer<br>that some chris jackson spent 10 years<br>trying to convince people with evidence<br>that we should be doing something about<br>various cancers um<br>and then he decided that the politicians<br>actually don't listen to<br>science and evidence what they want the<br>stories<br>and so we had a cancer<br>meeting uh 18 months ago where we<br>brought along blair vining who was dying<br>from bowel cancer and he stood up and<br>his wife<br>told of the experience they'd had in the<br>health services and out of that we got a<br>cancer agency we had the minister of<br>health and the director general of<br>health there<br>and 400 people and it was the power of<br>the story rather than the power of the<br>graph<br>that i think has changed mind so i think<br>we have to use both<br>i think we have to have the evidence but<br>i think we need to<br>actually get the stories behind that<br>evidence in order to change<br>the way we think about things yeah i<br>would say<br>there are different concepts and<br>understandings of what constitutes<br>evidence it reminds me uh years and<br>years ago michael muhammad<br>michael marmot who's known worldwide for<br>his<br>leadership in the social determinants of<br>health and<br>chaired a world health organization<br>commission on that topic<br>before he did that he chaired a<br>commission for the uk government looking<br>at the relationship between alcohol and<br>health and and they brought<br>this commission made a number of<br>recommendations to the british<br>government<br>and then he was rather dismayed to find<br>that that<br>these recommendations weren't actually<br>just fully implemented<br>and that led to him publishing a paper<br>in the british medical journal called<br>policy-based evidence or evidence-based<br>policy<br>and he came to understand that of course<br>government has to take into account all<br>other kinds of evidence not just the<br>scientific evidence that his commission<br>was based on so i think i mean it's it's<br>really adding to what rice has said that<br>it's understanding uh people's different<br>perceptions and perspectives and<br>connecting<br>with them and finding a way of<br>connecting for them to them then<br>better understand what we do know and<br>what we don't know<br>about whatever the topic might be um<br>yeah<br>anyways you'd like to comment on that i<br>think part of it<br>too is maybe like i find<br>for like the next generation of so i<br>teach first-year university students<br>and training training people to think<br>critically<br>about the information in front of them<br>and where your information is from<br>and so hopefully if we can if we can<br>help<br>you if we can encourage them to think<br>about where they're getting their<br>information from<br>and to think critically about the<br>information in front of you not just<br>because it's on facebook it's true<br>um then hopefully you know that spreads<br>into them talking to their peers and<br>their<br>family and whanau and stuff as well so<br>what we do with<br>teaching and teaching and how we teach<br>our students to analyze<br>what's in front of them also i think<br>helps to<br>to kind of contribute to<br>analyzing or evaluating the source of<br>the information i think is a big one<br>yeah yeah like caramel and you commented<br>particularly on on some of the kovid<br>related aspects of the community<br>and and i guess there was quite a lot<br>there about connecting<br>evidence in a way that just made sense<br>to people so do you have a particular<br>view on on how we might go about that<br>i think the one of the important things<br>is that there is you know you're<br>collecting the stories<br>and that you're listening to those<br>stories and that you're listening to the<br>perspectives<br>and because there's a lot of evidence<br>to show that you know for example that<br>inequities exist<br>and that policies and practices and<br>structures need to change and there's a<br>lot of evidence<br>for that um and so on the one hand<br>there's a lot of evidence for things and<br>but things aren't happening<br>um and so if you are looking for<br>a truth or a way of you know educating<br>the public<br>that you're doing that in a respectful<br>way that ensures that what's being<br>collected does get used in a way that's<br>appropriate<br>so that that information is is useful<br>um and it really is about challenging<br>some of those widely held narratives<br>you know like that it's might that maori<br>are to blame for their own situation or<br>that racism doesn't exist<br>so that there's always a counter<br>narrative and that we're<br>working towards building that counter<br>narrative yeah<br>yeah i was quite taking tony with your<br>example about the tasers and the police<br>that was a situation where you were able<br>to look at their<br>their statistics and show that there was<br>this situation where they were two and a<br>half more<br>times like more likely to use the taser<br>in a mental health emergency situation<br>um i mean well done on getting the<br>police to listen to you and do something<br>about that<br>so so is there i i suspect there are<br>sort of the same sort of myths that sit<br>around<br>mental health all over the place is<br>there something particular about how we<br>tell those<br>i kind of feel maybe i'm going to stray<br>off point here but um<br>i've been in mental health nursing for a<br>long time that's your<br>opening slide i mentioned um and<br>one of the one of the things that i'm<br>very aware of is we had<br>this big inquiry into mental health and<br>addiction<br>in new zealand and run by the government<br>2018<br>very comprehensive kind of investigation<br>took a very long time<br>was very traumatic actually for the um<br>investigation team because of the<br>intensity of the stories that they<br>listened to<br>that people came forward with and then<br>of course they were charged with the<br>responsibility of doing something with<br>all of that<br>and not just in terms of how they<br>processed it and how they<br>dealt with the the kind of experience of<br>but what sort of recommendations would<br>they make but what<br>struck me about that inquiry is that um<br>uh 20 years ago we had a similar inquiry<br>um between 1996<br>and that was into mental health services<br>quite a different focus actually<br>but it was a big report that drove some<br>significant developments um within<br>mental health<br>one was the establishment of the mental<br>health commission in 1998<br>and from a nursing perspective there was<br>a lot of investment after that report<br>postgraduate education for for mental<br>health nurses prior to that<br>there had been none and not long before<br>that<br>nursing had moved out of the<br>hospital-based program so there was a<br>kind of loss of specialty focus<br>but the difference in the focus of<br>mental health how mental health is<br>thought about<br>was quite dramatic over that 22-year<br>period so<br>1996 it's all about mental health<br>services<br>it did lead to the mental health<br>commission which<br>opened up the kind of discussion about<br>how do we think about<br>mental health mental illness mental<br>disorder um<br>and in particular the kind of<br>development of the recovery approach<br>well is the the not development that was<br>already there but bringing it into kind<br>of mainstream<br>um thinking around mental health the the<br>last report 2018 was into mental health<br>and addiction<br>in new zealand not services and um<br>that looked at mental health and<br>addiction across the community<br>in health care obviously in mental<br>health specialist addiction services<br>that kind of thing<br>but it wasn't quite so it wasn't nearly<br>as focused so we<br>are thinking much more broadly about um<br>mental health now<br>than we were 20 years ago um<br>and um yeah i think there's something<br>around<br>when we think about people's perceptions<br>of illness of<br>what's provided and people's perception<br>of where the gaps are that kind of thing<br>if we're going to offer interventions<br>whether they're mental health<br>addiction or vaccinations that kind of<br>thing<br>we have to be engaged with the community<br>around<br>what are we doing it for and what are<br>the<br>community goals that we're trying to<br>achieve<br>and people have to be able to identify<br>with those which they won't do if<br>they're simply handed to them<br>so that's um sorry a kind of roundabout<br>way of<br>talking about um kind of shared um<br>ideas around what we're trying to<br>achieve in healthcare<br>and um yeah i do agree that um with the<br>comment i figured he made it<br>um about um people opting for<br>you know a kind of a radical narrative<br>that seems to empower them<br>um because they don't identify with the<br>dominant narrative that might be kind of<br>um might they might feel is kind of<br>thrown at them that they don't have any<br>um opportunity to dispute or discuss or<br>engage with<br>yeah so yeah fair enough um<br>so so this next question is interesting<br>one because if<br>what we hear there from each of you in<br>in your own way we're saying<br>you get people to engage with the<br>evidence by getting them to engage with<br>the story behind the evidence which is a<br>very human<br>centered way of looking at this so this<br>next question turns that around a little<br>bit<br>how are we going to incorporate<br>artificial intelligence<br>into healthcare in new zealand and and<br>you can see where big data sets are<br>going to have a massive impact in in the<br>hard sciences and now in the social<br>sciences<br>so what are your views on the role of<br>artificial intelligence<br>and ultimately machine learning in in<br>healthcare provision<br>we'll start at this end this time and go<br>well i guess i see uh any kind of use of<br>of computers<br>and and uh artificial intelligence<br>intelligence machine learning etc as<br>as powerful tools that that can<br>uh be used to enhance<br>the quality the effectiveness of of<br>healthcare that's provided<br>they can also be become a kind of<br>a smokescreen or a substitute or<br>and and in the whether intended or not<br>in the process<br>dehumanize uh the the experience so<br>people who have health problems and<br>maybe present as patients or clients of<br>healthcare providers<br>if what they get is is a screen and<br>and uh you know respond a whole lot of<br>questions and eventually<br>you know the screen talks to them or<br>tells them<br>there might even be an artificial face<br>on the screen um<br>you know that's that's lacking the the<br>the sense of of human contact and the<br>recognition of humanity so<br>one uh organization i was involved with<br>in<br>in canada um that you know the<br>the theme that they were pursuing was<br>compassion in the technological world so<br>getting the balance between<br>the importance of that human connection<br>and understanding and<br>and and and uh<br>helping people as human beings uh with<br>their<br>with their lives and their health<br>problems and and pursuing<br>uh well-being at the same time as using<br>the technology<br>as as powerful tools to actually be more<br>successful in<br>in achieving that well-being i'm going<br>to<br>jump down to you ross because i know<br>that your research has looked at the<br>power of big data sets<br>and what we can do with big data sets um<br>so so<br>where do you see the role of ai sitting<br>in healthcare<br>certainly the opportunities around big<br>data sets are huge<br>you know and we're beginning to do that<br>new zealand has some of the best<br>computerized general practice<br>records you know we have 17 million<br>gp visits a year um you know so when<br>you've got the power of those data<br>and you can link those to laboratory<br>data to other data<br>um you know you need ai and the big<br>data computing to do that but i think<br>you know in the area of diagnostics you<br>know<br>amanda oakley's got 300 000 pictures of<br>skin<br>lesions you know and she's working with<br>the ai people about<br>you know actually computers can make a<br>better diagnosis of your skin lesion<br>than a doctor can<br>um so you know it's a learning process<br>for the<br>the computers to learn the different<br>lesions that are going on there ai in<br>imaging you know your mri and your<br>ct scans now you know they're not real<br>pictures<br>they're pictures that the computer have<br>generated from the information that's<br>coming into them<br>so ai is already here it's um you know<br>being<br>vastly incorporated in what we're doing<br>yeah and we just need to embrace it and<br>use it<br>without losing the human touch of<br>you know if you've got a diagnosis you<br>still then have to talk to somebody<br>about the implications of that and what<br>that means to you<br>um yeah joe we were talking earlier<br>about<br>pcr sequencing and genome sequencing the<br>amount of<br>data that we can generate from those now<br>is it reliant on artificial intelligence<br>to be useful or is it<br>is it not that far along yet i would say<br>it's not that<br>far along yet but you definitely need<br>massive computing power<br>um to be able to um to be able to<br>analyze<br>like massive genome data sets yeah i<br>think the one of the biggest<br>problems is data storage so and<br>data sovereignty and who you know like<br>and um privacy of that data and stuff as<br>well is a<br>yeah as a big issue that i know lots of<br>grappling with i guess yeah absolutely<br>any other comments about the role of<br>ai um if i could just say uh<br>if my colleague matthew parsons was here<br>he'd have quite a bit to say about<br>ai it's an area of interest for him and<br>matthew's also very<br>familiar with working with um big data<br>sets<br>and so and he's quite keen for us in the<br>um in the nursing school i'm calling at<br>the nursing school it's not the nursing<br>school<br>at the moment um to to kind of<br>incorporate some of that understanding<br>with<br>um within our research programs and in<br>our teaching<br>students i'm not an ai person so<br>i won't be part of that but i'll be a a<br>an enthusiastic kind of learner i guess<br>um<br>um yeah so um<br>uh yeah definitely something that's here<br>as as ross says<br>and that's for us as um for those of us<br>who are clinicians<br>um to learn about what ai can do<br>to help us in our work and then it's for<br>us as clinicians to still do that work<br>of<br>talking to people um understanding what<br>they're experiencing<br>and kind of helping them work through<br>what their options are<br>yeah i'm mindful of time and there's a<br>couple of very short punchy questions<br>here that suggest to me that there's<br>people after specific pieces of<br>information about the nursing program so<br>i'm just going to jump straight to those<br>um how many students do you expect to<br>enroll in nursing in the first year of<br>the nursing program<br>for 40 students maybe more<br>no more we're not allowed to enroll<br>anymore 40. well it<br>depends how you split the yes but yeah<br>yeah go far enough<br>yep so so 40 is the answer to that<br>question um<br>and and also is graduate nursing<br>training for graduates of the nursing<br>school only<br>um most of it is but the graduate<br>program<br>um is not just for nurses so um some of<br>the<br>some of the programs and some of the<br>courses will be multi-disciplinary<br>fair enough um and a quick question<br>what is the population of northern<br>ontario<br>north ontario it's just under 800 000<br>people so<br>would the northern ontario model work<br>for a rural providing<br>medical school in this region<br>well in new zealand for rural remote new<br>zealand yes yep<br>cool um i i think i should probably draw<br>a line under it there's<br>there's lots of other i but i'm<br>apologize<br>of time it's raining out there and i<br>want everyone to drive safely on the way<br>home<br>so i will i will just end um opening the<br>floor<br>back to our wonderful panelists is there<br>any last thoughts that you'd like to<br>share<br>if not that's fine too but if if yes<br>just jump on in<br>i'll say something just to say um again<br>thanks for organizing this um<br>and everybody else who's been involved<br>amanda did a great job it's kind of<br>getting everything sequenced and being<br>very tolerant of me saying i'll get you<br>my<br>powerpoint presentation tomorrow i<br>didn't mean this tomorrow i mean the<br>next one<br>but um i worked at the university of<br>auckland for 20 years we never did<br>anything like this i never didn't know<br>this in<br>the whole time that i was there so you<br>know i think it's great to be able to<br>have this so i like<br>being able to have this opportunity to<br>say this is what i'm about what do you<br>want to say about that or you know<br>be here to kind of um engage with with<br>the community so yeah i think it's a<br>great um<br>a great event also to actually hear<br>some of my colleagues talking about<br>their work unfortunately<br>one of the problems in the university is<br>you kind of head down doing it and not<br>really talking to your colleagues about<br>what they're doing one of the great<br>delights of my role as deputy vice<br>chancellor researchers i get to stick my<br>nose in anywhere i like and organize<br>things like this so<br>i get a really easy job and i get to<br>speak to wonderful people like you so<br>thank you all very much<br>any last thoughts from anyone else well<br>i would just echo<br>what's being said pick up what joe said<br>at the beginning of her<br>presentation um you know it's it is<br>as tony said not that common at the<br>moment uh for<br>for those of us in in in health<br>research and the universities really to<br>to present<br>to a mixed audience actually what we do<br>and i think that that's you know back to<br>that first question about evidence and<br>so on the more that there is that<br>that opportunity to share uh the work<br>that we do<br>and and and interact with people who<br>have an interest or would like to<br>develop an interest<br>and that i think the better for all of<br>us really so i<br>certainly encourage this to be a<br>continuing uh<br>series of events for university of<br>waikato i know you should say that<br>so so to wind up with tonight i'd like<br>to thank you all for<br>for coming and thank you for your<br>thoughtful questions and and if you want<br>to color them on the way out you know<br>just just do that because they're not<br>off the stage<br>yet um and i'd invite you all to follow<br>the university of waikato on eventbrite<br>and facebook apparently<br>um which is social media so i don't know<br>anything about it um<br>but for an update on our next public<br>lecture now the kopapa colorado series<br>this is the the<br>last talk for for this year in this<br>particular series but it will be<br>starting in 2021 with uh extensive<br>series of cop avocado<br>and and and thank you for the comments i<br>think this is exactly what the<br>university needs to do<br>to engage with people who are interested<br>and to share what we're doing which is<br>so impactful and world-changing<br>so thank you all very much to our<br>panelists for your insights tonight i<br>personally found it absolutely i could<br>have sat there all night and listened to<br>you so thank you very much<br>and i'd like to invite you all to join<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
