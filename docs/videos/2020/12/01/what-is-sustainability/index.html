I make aluminum iron batteries, <br>and the best way to describe this technology is  <br>that it's safer, cheaper, and sustainable. I'm on <br>the verge of commercializing these batteries. The  <br>whole idea is to make the customers or the public <br>aware that there is this alternate technology  <br>available other than lithium-ion that is safer <br>and cheaper and you know it's more sustainable.  <br>At the core of sustainability is essentially <br>the desire to make things better, to make  <br>things better for the environment, to make things <br>better for people, for our current generations,  <br>for future generations. Sustainable practice <br>is starting to become the easier option  <br>and I think that just really <br>makes a world of difference.  <br>I started creating a virtual, I think <br>virtual field trip is probably the best word,  <br>so we use gaming software to take students into <br>this environment where we have replicated an  <br>entire island and students then visit that <br>island and talk to the community members about  <br>what their aspirations are for the future <br>and how tourism impacts on that island.  <br>Now that you know all this stuff -what am I going <br>to do in response? Sustainability is not going  <br>to go very much ahead without creativity, and <br>creativity- you need leaders, you know, you want  <br>great leaders to think about how creative your <br>ideas can get and how you can make things or ideas  <br>more sustainable. What really is exciting is when <br>students really get it, but also when they become  <br>passionate about sustainability, and all of that <br>starts with really engaging with the material. I  <br>know there are a variety of sustainability <br>initiatives that we have here on campus at  <br>Victoria University of Wellington that were <br>actually brought forward by students just because  <br>someone looked at things a little bit critically <br>and said, "listen I think we might be able to  <br>do this better, are you interested in hearing <br>what I have to say?" and we are so interested.<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
