accurate.</p><p>i am john some of you i've met already<br>um have come in to see me i've answered<br>your emails but yes this is the face<br>behind the advice uh and of course<br>you're welcome to carry on and<br>communicate with me after this webinar<br>i appreciate that the planning process<br>um<br>and undertaking postgrad study is pretty<br>scary and our website is sometimes<br>not the easiest to find your way around<br>so keep those questions coming<br>so the format for today's webinar is we<br>have a panel of<br>experts of super brains who are<br>currently studying with us<br>some who have left us and who are high<br>functioning high achieving humans and<br>other<br>research fields so we'll be hearing from<br>them and really the focus of the<br>discussion today is going to be<br>learning about i guess the post-grad<br>student experience and the realities of<br>undertaking post-grad study<br>some people will be doing it on campus<br>we have people who are doing it with us<br>who are studying by distance so you can<br>ask some questions about that<br>you may have some specific program<br>questions<br>and some of those questions we'll be<br>able to answer<br>based on the types of degrees that our<br>panelists are doing<br>we haven't got representatives from<br>every degree because that would be<br>a little bit challenging so if we don't<br>have a panelist from<br>who's studying the degree that you're<br>interested in that's okay you can still<br>ask us questions<br>okay so i think i will start this<br>conversation off by<br>introducing our panelists and then we're<br>going to start<br>and have you tell us a bit about your<br>story your experience of study and the<br>things that you were sharing with me<br>when we just got started<br>i think it's a great story but first<br>i'll just introduce everybody<br>and then we'll get on to lara's story<br>and then we'll go to rhiannon<br>then lachlan and then alzena how does<br>that sound<br>great i see this amazing chorus of yes<br>that is incredible<br>uh lara let's introduce you first<br>go for it hi i'm lara hi<br>kiara great lara<br>is uh our master of information studies<br>right i got that correct um so<br>lara is going to talk about her<br>experience studying online<br>what's involved in that program and some<br>of the experiences that have led to<br>where<br>she is today um not that we mind this<br>lara is down in dunedin at the moment<br>working for otago university<br>which is also quite good but we can<br>reflect on that later on<br>you're still working for victoria at the<br>same time though so thanks<br>uh rhiannon could you introduce yourself<br>please<br>hi my name is ranan and my<br>undergrad is in science and i decided to<br>do business analysis i got a job<br>at the department of conservation when i<br>got out of uni for the first time<br>and i started working there and i kind<br>of uh fell in love with<br>improvement projects uh if you work for<br>any government department you'll quickly<br>realize that there are a lot of problems<br>to be solved<br>and one of my favorite parts of my job<br>was getting involved<br>in that problem solving and i realized<br>that that's what i wanted to do for a<br>career<br>so i looked up all these different<br>options talked to<br>all the people who were leading the<br>projects which i was getting involved<br>with<br>and um settled on the masters of<br>professional business analysis at vic<br>and i was planning to go to studying<br>perfect in in<br>in person but of course covert kind of<br>uh took an x to that plan so i'm<br>currently<br>still living in hamilton which is where<br>i've been for the last seven years<br>and hoping to get to wellington next<br>year to finish off my degree with my<br>amazing classmates in real life<br>okay wow that's a pretty amazing story<br>thank you for sharing that we'll be<br>coming back to you with lots of<br>questions about that program uh<br>lachlan you are next on my list could<br>you introduce yourself please<br>sure kyoto koto my name's lachlan i<br>did my undergraduate in commerce<br>studying marketing and commercial law<br>i then decided to continue my studies<br>with a master of commerce<br>focused in marketing um i'll tell you<br>more about it later<br>overall i really enjoyed it because it<br>was sort of all round and a lot of<br>research based<br>which helped me with my job which i've<br>recently got as a<br>policy analyst in the ministry for<br>primary industries<br>where i perform a market research<br>function so it's nice for me<br>and hopefully the value i'll offer is<br>the academic side as well as<br>what it's like in the in the real world<br>um<br>yeah so i look forward to talking to you<br>later awesome thanks lachlan and it'll<br>be great to learn more about your<br>research too for<br>anybody who's attending this webinar<br>who's thinking about<br>well should i do a tour program or<br>should i focus on a<br>long-term research project and how might<br>that influence my<br>career decisions afterwards uh alzina<br>would you mind introducing yourself<br>please sure<br>um hello everyone i'm ausina in case you<br>haven't heard my name twice already<br>um i am pursuing my masters in<br>professional accounting<br>at victoria university of wellington and<br>i'm currently based in wellington<br>so got god's with me on that part um<br>i have been a masters in commerce and<br>i've done my undergrad in commerce<br>that's all for now thank you okay thank<br>you very much<br>so i'm going to come back to everybody<br>with some questions but now i'm going<br>full circle back to lara in dunedin<br>live from dunedin and lara i'm wondering<br>if you could just tell us a little bit<br>about your story of<br>how you became involved in the master of<br>information studies<br>um and share with us a bit of that sort<br>of learning journey and that experience<br>as a<br>as a ms student as we call you um<br>with us yes so i was<br>um finishing up my phd and they kind of<br>lost my phd<br>um at where wookies it was sent to<br>australia rather than england and<br>um i was coming to the end of my<br>publishing bursary and i was going<br>what do i do next i have nothing<br>and so i enrolled in the masters of<br>information studies because<br>i thought why not it was a professional<br>program<br>i had already attained a masters of arts<br>and<br>child and youth studies and i wanted to<br>do something sort of<br>professional that kind of complemented<br>what i'd done as an undergrad so i had<br>my history english and classical studies<br>um and i had a passion for<br>research i also had a passion for um<br>history<br>so yeah that's sort of how i came to<br>to start my journey um and and i've<br>loved it<br>um i double majored in records<br>management and<br>uh archives and also library sciences<br>wow that's quite a study journey<br>yes yeah it was and and how did you find<br>because the master of information<br>studies of course is one of the programs<br>that<br>victoria university has had that's been<br>delivered online for some time<br>so how did you find that as a method of<br>learning as a student because obviously<br>you've done your phd and that's very<br>much an on-campus based thing<br>so some people might be quite new to the<br>whole online learning<br>reality how did you find it i found it<br>amazing<br>um i always sort of through my research<br>uni has always sort of been<br>quite isolated because you know with<br>your phd<br>you're living with your phd you're<br>writing your phd in your little bubble<br>um but somehow<br>the online journey the community that's<br>created online<br>you don't feel isolated at all um even<br>though<br>you're in your room or you you're in<br>your own little bubble still<br>but you have this community to draw on<br>um which was amazing<br>um and i mean because they have been<br>online an online course for so long that<br>it just flows um there were no sort of<br>hiccups at their end um<br>yeah it was amazing i i really enjoyed<br>it um i felt<br>i almost felt because there are small<br>classes that<br>um they were more approachable um online<br>and<br>you know it was like we were doing<br>face-to-face um<br>anyway so one-on-one it almost felt like<br>but with the community of<br>learners within your classrooms so yeah<br>cool i liked uh reflection there about<br>it still felt like a community even<br>though you're online<br>can i just jump on the end of that so i<br>did that would be great<br>i did um two papers in my last um<br>semester of my undergrad<br>through massey university and i felt<br>super disconnected from everyone i<br>didn't know anyone else in my class at<br>all<br>never had the ability to kind of<br>get to know them or speak to them or<br>form study groups but<br>um even though i've been doing the<br>masters of professional business<br>analysis online i'm like best friends<br>with everyone in my class like really<br>we have a group chat we talk to each<br>other non-stop we have study groups with<br>each other<br>we had an end of year uh end of prime<br>minister drinks last trimester and i<br>actually flew<br>from hamilton to wellington just to hang<br>out with them all so<br>um it's it's really social and even with<br>the lecturers and stuff we had a<br>friday afternoon class last trimester<br>and our lecturer would always stick<br>around for 10 to 15 minutes at the end<br>of that class just to have some banter<br>with us which was<br>really awesome and it was just even<br>though we were doing everything<br>through zoom and microsoft teams<br>we were still super connected which is<br>something that i hadn't experienced<br>in previous online learning and i was so<br>anxious when i had that<br>the course was going to be delivered<br>online but like i absolutely love it<br>which i'm sure would have been a<br>question from everybody thank you<br>yes you can go to classes in your onesie<br>thank you for that detail<br>that very hamilton-esque detail rhiannon<br>um i even in fact<br>meet up with um i and i worked with<br>some of my uh online colleagues too so<br>in archives<br>um and and we met up for coffees and<br>yeah it helps so um<br>in the mists program you're encouraged<br>to um<br>sort of belong become a student member<br>of um a rams which is<br>new zealand archiving or lianza which is<br>new zealand libraries<br>so that you're part of the professional<br>community as well and you're welcomed<br>into the professional community<br>as a student um and there's very much<br>that<br>online as well in the classes is that<br>you're being<br>you're becoming part of a professional<br>community and so therefore you're being<br>welcome<br>into that community yeah that's awesome<br>feedback and i think<br>uh people who are attending this may<br>have questions about online<br>learning that relates to other programs<br>so we're definitely going to be able to<br>answer those questions for you<br>uh lachlan i'm going to put this<br>conversation over to you now<br>just to give us a little bit of a story<br>about your experiences<br>around doing your master's research<br>and just reflecting on i think you said<br>you got a scholarship didn't you where<br>you<br>got a particular work placement but<br>anyway yours is very much an on campus<br>uh connected to wellington kind of study<br>experience so it'd be great to learn a<br>little bit more about that<br>yeah sure so um that's right oh before i<br>talk about my scholarship<br>i got through um a class we had a guest<br>speaker come in<br>who i talked to afterwards who then<br>encouraged me to apply for a role in the<br>advertising standards authority so<br>that was a sort of nice cv builder and<br>experience builder<br>um for me personally in getting me into<br>the professional world<br>um and although that was an<br>undergraduate from that i then got a<br>scholarship through vic<br>a summer scholarship so it's available<br>to<br>undergraduate and postgraduate students<br>to work<br>at the ministry for primary industries<br>which is where i work now<br>following that i applied for a job here<br>and i've got it<br>which was largely because of what i was<br>studying<br>and the research element of that so<br>although<br>my research in postgrad is focused on<br>marketing<br>um what i'm doing in a professional<br>sense is market research but a lot of<br>a lot of the inner workings are the same<br>because you're still applying<br>research methodologies it's just in a<br>different context so<br>the skills are very much transferable um<br>if you're interested in asking those<br>sort of why questions or the what if and<br>how does something work um so in my<br>on-campus experience again i was<br>disrupted by covert 19 as well<br>but um in the first uh semester or<br>trimester<br>you do two research based papers which<br>um<br>teach you essentially research<br>methodologies so there's a more<br>quantitative and<br>more qualitative they together form a<br>really good foundation<br>um which helps the way that you view the<br>world and that you view<br>problems rather than just being a sort<br>of technical<br>you know box ticking exercise you have<br>to do to move on<br>um you also get to focus on what you<br>want to study so for me it was a<br>marketing course<br>and um they encouraged that you get a<br>more diverse sort of background so i<br>also did an international business<br>course which was<br>a lot of fun um and then for the for my<br>course that i'm enrolled in<br>we also had to do a uh management course<br>which<br>was sort of it was it allowed you scope<br>to focus on your discipline so<br>if you were interested in um doing<br>information systems you could focus on<br>that<br>for me i focused with a marketing lens<br>and others focused on<br>international business or management um<br>the lecturers were really good it was<br>great to interact with them<br>um we went online for a period as well<br>through covert<br>i enjoyed that slightly less um but<br>it was it was still it was still<br>beneficial and it was still worthwhile<br>um but the lecturers that i've had from<br>my experience were really good they<br>they care about what they do they're<br>there to do post-grad because it's sort<br>of what interests<br>them in their research so if you can<br>engage with the subject matter<br>and really um become engaged with what<br>you want to do<br>it it really helps because the lecturers<br>enjoy that and they they<br>sort of live for that as well um<br>as far as other and now that sort of led<br>to my professional job where i'm doing<br>market research in in the real world so<br>we sort of act to inform policy<br>decisions<br>but we do that through consumer surveys<br>doing<br>both quant and qual as well as doing<br>desktop analysis<br>to ask research questions big and small<br>so if you want to understand<br>why consumers purchase a certain type of<br>product in an export market what are the<br>sort of credence qualities behind that<br>that's the things that<br>we're researching as well as it might be<br>framework things to try and understand<br>what sustainability does or doesn't mean<br>as well as little nitty-gritty things<br>like sort of what is the overview of<br>this<br>of this market or of this product so<br>it's really diverse skills<br>um that have sort of built off of my off<br>of my masters that i'm working on<br>in the background are sort of useful<br>even though they're completely different<br>my master's is in political marketing<br>which is quite<br>niche or at least that's what my thesis<br>is based in<br>um that is not taught by coursework it's<br>purely research based<br>so it's a lot of reading um it's a lot<br>of<br>a lot of critical comments backwards and<br>forwards about sort of why i'm doing<br>this<br>and and so on um and it's challenging<br>but i'm really enjoying it thus far um<br>so yes if anyone has any questions<br>please flick them through thanks lachlan<br>i really like your story because<br>uh sometimes when people are coming into<br>our office<br>and they're exploring programs they<br>might not know about<br>a research pathway or perhaps fully<br>be able to wrap their head around how it<br>might connect to career opportunities<br>later on and i think you articulated<br>that really well<br>and i think it's important to note too<br>that there's no wrong pathway either in<br>terms of what it is that you're going to<br>go on and do<br>in terms of your program they're all<br>valuable they're all valid<br>it's just a case of choosing the right<br>thing that fits with your learning style<br>and that hopefully will drive you<br>forward and want to learn more<br>and that passion will come through and<br>drive you into the careers<br>and things that you want to achieve<br>after you've completed your studies so<br>that's a really good story thank you<br>lachlan<br>uh alzena we have not forgotten about<br>you uh you're a final student panelist<br>before i put over the q a<br>to our attendees if you wouldn't mind<br>sharing a bit about your journey<br>you're doing the master of professional<br>accounting and of course i realize<br>you're also<br>working as an accountant at the same<br>time so learning a little bit about that<br>would be great<br>sure um so i will take over from here<br>for a few minutes you've got to bear up<br>with me<br>um many students actually feel that an<br>accountant's job is just sitting at a<br>desk and just<br>looking at the numbers and observing<br>what it is but i'll give you a backdrop<br>to that i<br>was a financial analyst prior to<br>completing<br>or planning to do my accountancy here<br>and<br>the main idea with being an analyst is<br>you have the numbers in front of you<br>and all you have to do is understand why<br>they exist<br>but somehow i found this difference<br>between understanding the numbers and<br>actually bringing them<br>up to a certain page for you to analyze<br>them and for me<br>that was the game change in my life i<br>was working<br>at morgan stanley fund services and then<br>i moved on to a national life firm and i<br>worked in london for about an year<br>and i realized that working just as an<br>analyst at one point<br>sort of made me feel know i think i can<br>do better i think i can contribute<br>better and not just look at numbers like<br>that as it is<br>and i decided to take up accountancy and<br>when i first started into it it was a<br>nightmare because i had a lot to do<br>and it was so difficult because i had<br>four plus courses<br>in that first quarter but then<br>i started to realize that this is how<br>it's going to be and i actually<br>started to love it simply because i knew<br>what i wanted to be in life<br>and that's what drew me to the course<br>i then wanted to apply mine to mata and<br>i actually planned it up on a job<br>which is an accounting role for<br>part-time work and<br>i managed to put my tomato in that job<br>and today and<br>recently promoted as well so i'm really<br>really proud to<br>to learn it and actually being able to<br>apply it i mean<br>students get confused i was the confused<br>person at one point in time but<br>today i'm actually very happy that i've<br>taken up this course needless to say<br>victoria has<br>actually added the ca pathway so while<br>you're doing your master's you can<br>actually<br>become a chartered accountant by<br>completing your technical modules<br>while you're studying and then all you<br>need is a three years<br>experience to complete your so-called<br>articleship<br>which then converts you into a chartered<br>accountant<br>way earlier than anyone else if you<br>choose this course we open some<br>questions<br>thank you all right that's a great story<br>too and um<br>to me that really signifies sometimes<br>you<br>might shy away from something because<br>you thought oh you know i don't know<br>whether that's a particularly good fit<br>but then when you embrace it fully as<br>you have<br>it realizes success in all kinds of<br>formats<br>so anyone who's listening to that story<br>now you know i really encourage you to<br>think about<br>diverse ranges of programs because you<br>just never know you might<br>really fit and align with something that<br>you might not have thought of<br>previously okay so that's a lot of<br>talking from everybody here<br>i am now going to put it to everybody<br>who's attending to<br>send in some questions using the q<br>a function and i'm hoping that we'll be<br>able to<br>answer them effectively so it's over to<br>you<br>attendees please send in some questions<br>i'm looking at the question box<br>anxiously now thinking<br>well soon there's going to be a deep<br>probing question<br>let me have a look here can i just say<br>in terms of careers i always thought<br>that<br>leo wanted to be a scientist and i um<br>i had that goal in mind since i was like<br>maybe 13. um and it's only when i got<br>into the workforce and i i found this<br>completely other thing<br>business analysis which involved like a<br>lot of the same kind of things in terms<br>of<br>um being really inquisitive and<br>methodology and all that sort of thing<br>and then i looked into a bit more and<br>found out that i could make<br>way more money and have a lot more<br>career options<br>um and then i i found this course so<br>sometimes you end up in places that you<br>didn't expect<br>um but it's i'm hoping it will be<br>worthwhile in the long term<br>i've already got a lot more career<br>prospects than i ever had<br>as a science undergrad<br>yeah that's true and i imagine that your<br>background in science though with that<br>would have lent itself nicely to that<br>master of professional business analysis<br>now i've just had this question leap up<br>in my screen here i feel like i'm<br>i feel like i'm alan degeneres only not<br>as good or not as successful and not as<br>wealthy but i'll try and get the<br>question answered<br>here this question says<br>i'm interested in the masters in public<br>policy<br>is it possible to switch between<br>full-time and part-time<br>yes it is possible to do that<br>quite often our public policy masters<br>students<br>are in full-time work uh so that would<br>be perfectly normal because life happens<br>and obviously the master in public<br>policies<br>taught in a block format as well so that<br>lends itself<br>to part-time study particularly well<br>and then another component of that<br>question that i've just got in front of<br>me<br>is is it possible to oh no i've read<br>that one<br>so can you do one paper and one semester<br>yes<br>and then later do some more absolutely<br>you can<br>um that means that you would be able to<br>plan out your year and you could do<br>let's say for argument's sake one and<br>one trimester<br>a couple of courses and a second<br>trimester and maybe you can do one<br>in the summer trimester really the thing<br>that comes into that<br>is what courses you want to do and which<br>trimester they're running<br>to think about your planning so i hope<br>that answers your question<br>and that you heard that okay i've got<br>another question just come up here where<br>are we here<br>this is a question from a great student<br>that i've had the pleasure of meeting<br>earlier<br>and he's written here this question is<br>to all the panelists<br>um if you can wind back the clock to the<br>time when you're about to start your<br>study<br>with your current knowledge what would<br>you have done differently<br>um i wouldn't have chosen a different<br>course<br>but i i didn't take the advice of<br>what who's now my supervisor my<br>colleague um jennifer<br>she said don't do four papers a<br>trimester<br>um she said that's the craziest thing to<br>do<br>um i took four papers a trimester and it<br>was the craziest thing to do<br>um the workload was heavy very heavy<br>but because most people in the masters<br>of infection studies<br>only take one or two papers a trimester<br>and that's what they're used to<br>but i wanted to get through it a little<br>bit quicker<br>um but you know i managed but at the end<br>i was writing<br>at the end of each trimester i was<br>writing about 10 000 words for<br>essays and across the board um so yeah<br>don't do four papers at a tri-bester<br>unless you<br>really really want to get through it<br>okay<br>anyone else one of the panelists want to<br>share i'd like to add that part as well<br>okay for me um despite the current<br>knowledge that i have i think i wouldn't<br>change my course because i actually love<br>it<br>in terms of the workload i think yes<br>it's been quite extensive because<br>at one point in time i had to choose<br>like six papers<br>in the trimester and i was still working<br>part-time i mean in the same job which<br>i'm in now and it was quite tedious but<br>i think the basic instinct is time<br>management if you can do that i think<br>you can work into any field um go into<br>any sort of<br>master's clothes and you'll still be<br>able to get through because you've been<br>expected to be serious about the role<br>that you choose and what you want to be<br>in life<br>and the best way is the very first thing<br>and that's time management from my end<br>alzena i've also had a question here<br>from participant<br>i'm going to use their language here<br>because i love how they've written it<br>they have two burning questions for you<br>so this is awesome what is the best<br>advice you can give to students who do<br>not come from an accounting<br>background in order to succeed in the<br>mpa program<br>and a second component to their question<br>is<br>um this is quite detailed so i hope you<br>can answer this<br>and two out of the five trimesters<br>students take five papers or courses<br>which is a workload of 75 hours per week<br>which is quite a lot so how did you<br>manage this large workload all right so<br>i will try to answer both the questions<br>in one go<br>but if i do get methodical do not kill<br>me so<br>um the first is all right i'm sorry i<br>think i missed the question where is it<br>uh yeah i see it sorry about that so<br>first is the best advice that i could<br>give you is actually brushing up on some<br>bookkeeping skills prior to doing your<br>mpa<br>it's not a mandate for the course but<br>it's best to understand<br>how the entries are performed um so that<br>you can know its effect and<br>understanding within the course<br>um the second question um it is quite<br>technical because<br>you tend to have as i said before you've<br>got like six plus subjects within<br>within that one trimester and it does<br>get tedious<br>um but again it's it all boils down to<br>time management and sometimes<br>a few hours of less sleep i'd like to<br>put that away<br>because what happens is if you are<br>planning to work part-time and study<br>full-time and have six plus courses in<br>that<br>first trimester or whichever trimester<br>you've taken it does get<br>it does get tedious but there are<br>options to actually um diversify those<br>courses and<br>put those subjects into different<br>trimesters based on<br>your understanding or your need or maybe<br>your pressures<br>um at various areas so it depends on how<br>you decide to<br>take up this course and how serious you<br>are about the course<br>because it is honestly no joke but it's<br>very helpful<br>um it's worth the efforts by the end of<br>um your course i'm almost towards the<br>end of the course and i'm<br>really happy that i took this decision i<br>hope that helps<br>though that absolutely helps um<br>i've got another question here that i'll<br>just read out and after we've answered<br>this question i'm i'm mindful lachlan<br>that i did hear you start to speak in<br>the background so we will come back to<br>you<br>uh because i was just gonna say that um<br>with the courses<br>they do vary across different um<br>programs so<br>what there's four courses and one may<br>not be the same as what you're doing<br>just as a side note because like at<br>least for us<br>it's pretty standard that everyone does<br>for courses not to detract from laura's<br>statement i'm sure it's a lot harder for<br>her<br>for her yeah well yeah it was intense<br>because and that is the most intense<br>you're not you're actually not allowed<br>to do<br>you're technically allowed to do more<br>than three in my<br>course in the midst course yeah<br>awesome the question next question here<br>just working my way through these and<br>apologies if you're looking at this<br>you're thinking my gosh ellen degeneres<br>would at least know how to use the q a<br>function i am getting my head around it<br>slowly but surely<br>um this question says for someone<br>working full time and looking to study a<br>master's of<br>business uh with uh that would be<br>masters of business professional<br>with a finance focus so i'm i'm thinking<br>that might be the finance specialization<br>where you do the three<br>specialization courses incorporate into<br>that part-time<br>roughly how much time needs to be<br>dedicated weekly<br>to get through the course i think i can<br>answer that one<br>uh it's a little bit hard to answer<br>precisely because<br>how you navigate work and your working<br>style is quite individual<br>and of course part-time study might<br>depend on whether you're doing<br>one course or two courses but you should<br>be really allocating anything from 10 to<br>15 hours a week<br>per course i'm just going to put that to<br>the panel would you say that's a<br>i think it depends on on the course and<br>also<br>it kind of depends on on who you're as a<br>person what your goals are<br>you know if if you want to um do your<br>course and you just want to get<br>pretty good grades middle of the right<br>grades then<br>then maybe that's the amount of time<br>that you would want to spend on it but<br>if you<br>are aiming for an a plus then maybe you<br>have to spend a little bit more time and<br>if you're<br>the type of person who thinks c's get<br>degrees then spend a little bit less<br>time<br>you just kind of have to figure it out<br>as you go<br>and make sure that you are allocating<br>yourself the time that you need and make<br>sure that you're also<br>that's a great reflection yeah i think a<br>key message in all of this is<br>time planning your time carefully and i<br>can greatly appreciate there's probably<br>a lot of people have joined us who are<br>balancing careers they've got whanau<br>commitments<br>so that is a challenge managing your<br>time however<br>for so many of the professional programs<br>offered by victoria they are<br>at least taught in a way that allows for<br>that block management<br>approach to learning which i think makes<br>it a little bit more manageable<br>and in some of our disciplines not all<br>but in some<br>of course you've got the option of doing<br>things on campus<br>or online so that creates a little bit<br>of flexibility as well<br>now i have another bit for john here<br>sorry to cut you short<br>no no problem um so um just to give you<br>an<br>idea of how victoria helps you um<br>irrespective of how you are as a person<br>or how you wish to study<br>and the number of hours you wish to put<br>into um<br>during corporate times we we were forced<br>to go online at one point in time and<br>now you're back to<br>going offline and actually being in the<br>class which i totally prefer<br>we were actually given um a hardship<br>fund for us to<br>um you know just bring up bring<br>ourselves up to speed if you don't have<br>wi-fi connection<br>or maybe you don't have the correct um<br>technical<br>gadgets for yourself to you know be a<br>part of the course<br>um we were given those options and it<br>was really<br>helpful especially for international<br>students who come here and they wish to<br>make their ends meet while they're<br>studying<br>um i think it was really helpful at that<br>point so i'd just like to add that point<br>in there<br>thank you oh thanks for that alzina i<br>appreciate that<br>okay i've got another question here um<br>can anyone speak a bit about the masters<br>of global<br>business well that would be me i can't<br>do a massively detailed summary about<br>that program because there's a lot of<br>moving parts to it<br>but what i will say is that the master<br>of global business<br>is a program that is really tailored to<br>new graduates who may or may not have a<br>background in business<br>it does have very much an international<br>focus<br>one thing i'll point out that's a little<br>bit of a fish hook and planning is<br>if you are coming into the master of<br>global business as a student who<br>might have done an undergrad commerce<br>degree and you've already<br>extensively studied international<br>business<br>management and marketing you'll need a<br>bit of guidance in terms of how you plan<br>your courses if you're not a student<br>with a<br>commerce background directly then that<br>is also perfectly okay because as i said<br>earlier this program is<br>designed to really appeal to people who<br>don't have a background in in business<br>disciplines<br>irrespective of what you've been<br>studying in much the same way many of<br>our professional programs are<br>and that program will therefore be very<br>structured around a core of<br>international business<br>courses and will allow for a<br>specialization of three courses<br>bearing in mind that some of the<br>specializations for example finance and<br>economics<br>may require pre-requisite courses so i<br>guess a key<br>takeaway is happy to walk you through<br>that master of global business program<br>if you want to reach out to me via email<br>and i can contact<br>you after this so that that's easier for<br>you to do and i can walk you through<br>much more detailed information about<br>that program<br>what i will say is is that the master of<br>global business has proven to be a<br>hugely popular program<br>among our recent graduates so i<br>really think it's a great option if<br>that's your background<br>if you're well established in your<br>career then there might be other<br>pathways that you'd like to consider and<br>i'd happily talk about those with you as<br>well<br>so i hope that answers in part your<br>question<br>as i say i'll email you to follow up on<br>that okay i've got another<br>question here<br>this is a great question actually um<br>that i think will apply to lots of<br>people who are attending<br>uh so i'll put this out to everyone in<br>the panel<br>two well there's quite a few questions<br>here the first question is<br>uh which experiences courses or<br>activities that you participated in<br>while you've been studying while you're<br>at university did you find<br>find had the most benefit for you in<br>terms of<br>your future career after graduation<br>why don't i just throw that out to<br>panelists and uh<br>see who answers that um<br>i'll start uh so one thing that the<br>masters of<br>professional business analysis has is<br>the itc school brings in speakers<br>every week um which is really cool um<br>they're all from<br>industry so you get to have a chat to<br>them<br>um maybe add them on linkedin afterwards<br>see what their careers like<br>and then um you know if you make a good<br>connection<br>um hopefully you can kind of be informed<br>about<br>roles that come up in their company will<br>kind of just gain<br>insights from them also as like an<br>additional<br>extra you can be paired with a<br>um mentor as part of their mentorship<br>program<br>i have a really awesome mentor he works<br>in<br>i think it's like argentina so i meet<br>him at midnight my time so i can get him<br>at lunch this time<br>uh which is a little bit inconvenient<br>but he's really good and i've been<br>learning a lot of them<br>and then something that i haven't done<br>yet but i will do<br>is that in our last trimester we have a<br>project which is like in business or<br>coordinates with business slash industry<br>um and i'm really looking forward to<br>that because it will give me<br>some real life um you know experience<br>working<br>on problems and um a lot of people<br>get opportunities from those<br>interactions as well so<br>there's just a lot of opportunities to<br>meet with<br>industry and big industry players and<br>make an impression on them<br>which you know even though it might not<br>lead to something directly<br>networking is just so powerful um<br>in in finding out about job<br>opportunities and<br>also making impressions that you know<br>could lead to<br>thanks to that ryan that was a really<br>good description of how your course<br>connects to future employment<br>opportunities<br>i'm mindful that there's a few questions<br>backing up here so<br>question two on this list because i put<br>it live can be<br>answered by the panel but i'm gonna go<br>to question three on here which is a<br>great question as well<br>which is noted to be most suitable for<br>you lachlan given your<br>uh sort of public policy political<br>maneuverings in your career which you've<br>got well underway<br>and the question is how do you feel<br>about a career in public policy<br>and would you say or describe this<br>career as being intellectually engaging<br>varied and creative where no two<br>days are the same only you can answer<br>that because you're in the thick of<br>things<br>and what are some of the things that you<br>love about the job<br>and maybe what are some of the downsides<br>of uh the career that you might have<br>noticed<br>at this early outset sounds good i'm<br>still at work so i'll be careful not to<br>say anything<br>negative too loudly um no uh<br>i mean i'm i'm fortunate because what i<br>do although i am a policy analyst<br>i don't analyze a lot of policy i'm<br>because i perform market research i'm<br>quite cross-cutting so i'm talking to<br>people across the business which is<br>really interesting<br>um all of my training and previous work<br>experiences although<br>to a less professional extent have been<br>public<br>public sector um and there are some very<br>firm differences<br>i think a lot of people are built for<br>the public sector and really enjoy that<br>um that said these days it's not<br>too hard if you if you do a few years in<br>public or in private<br>swat um swapping over is is by no means<br>um impossible<br>um i do really enjoy it um partly<br>because for me it is very different<br>and there's a lot of short turnarounds<br>for me because i'm<br>less working on legislation like a lot<br>of my um my peers i'm<br>i'm helping to provide information that<br>might inform those policy decisions<br>and and affect how we sort of use our<br>policy toolbox<br>um so for me it is<br>well i find it stressful but rewarding<br>because there's a lot of short<br>um sort of questions that need answering<br>if someone needs to know something it's<br>come and talk to us and we'll try and do<br>it with rigor but<br>um in an efficient manner um<br>i'm still quite early on in my career so<br>i don't want to start talking for a<br>whole career path but<br>i i'm enjoying it so far um i<br>i expect in my career i'll work across<br>public and private but um<br>i i think it is really really useful and<br>the way from my experience and in my<br>opinion<br>the skills are a lot of a lot of<br>business-based skills so<br>i've come from the um masters of<br>commerce<br>so that's the sort of angle i bring less<br>a sort of<br>policy background um because we're<br>making a lot of<br>business decisions and decisions that<br>impact<br>business across across new zealand's<br>economy<br>and that is that is the same at least in<br>similar sort of comparable<br>countries like australia and their<br>public service um<br>and i can also talk really quickly to<br>point one and two of that question<br>mindful of time<br>in the job that i got they were looking<br>for someone who is holistically<br>valuable not just sort of has one narrow<br>skill that they can do really well<br>so for me i had a background in the<br>advertising standards authority i did<br>debating<br>i'm still ranked i think 300th ish in<br>the world for sailing which i competed<br>in<br>during my masters which is challenging<br>um<br>as well as um other sort of<br>sports commitments like i do football<br>and i do touch rugby as well<br>um and i had a radio show at the<br>victoria<br>university radio station as well so it's<br>doing just getting engaged and saying<br>yes to those opportunities which a lot<br>of them come up through<br>through the courses at vic and through<br>being around university of wellington<br>um is definitely helpful because at<br>least for my job they were looking for<br>someone who is holistically sort of<br>um valuable not just you know one skill<br>set so<br>i would say you put your hand up for<br>everything but think you know<br>obviously some some decisions might be<br>more useful than others<br>but yeah that's my two cents on that<br>well thanks for sharing that lachlan i<br>appreciate that<br>that's quite a journey for you now i've<br>got another question<br>down here so i'll just i'm figuring out<br>the answer live function here well<br>done john where when an attendee has<br>asked<br>i would like to do an internship as part<br>of my study<br>and also to increase my job prospects<br>post graduation and i think that's the<br>really important thing coming through<br>with everybody that i speak to<br>about programs because people are<br>getting ready to make a massive<br>commitment to a study program<br>and obviously they are focused on their<br>career so<br>i can totally understand why this is<br>critical to everyone's planning<br>and the question is is there anyone here<br>on the panel who did an<br>internship what's their experience and<br>would they re what was their experience<br>and would they recommend it<br>in terms of increasing post-graduation<br>job prospects<br>uh rhiannon you might have done one as a<br>consultancy possibly lara i don't know<br>whether you did one<br>um i did an internship at archives new<br>zealand<br>um where they just got their biggest<br>ever deposit<br>of land transport records<br>and i ended up sitting boxing<br>and um transcribing and<br>all of the information into the database<br>um<br>and it was good for making connections<br>with like over new zealand<br>um because obviously they're one of the<br>biggest employers of<br>archivists um and just<br>seeing the everyday nature of what<br>archiving<br>um is about so it's um<br>not just sitting behind your computer<br>your your<br>up and down letters and and lugging<br>boxes and stuff like that so it was it<br>was great<br>and i would do it and i would highly<br>suggest anyone<br>who particularly if you haven't had any<br>experience in your field<br>um to do one yeah<br>thanks for that yeah often um we get a<br>lot of questions about<br>internships versus research projects<br>versus consultancy projects and i think<br>you summarize that perfectly<br>um lara that when you're doing an<br>internship you're actually placed in the<br>business<br>doing the actual work and then that<br>might mean doing some work that's not<br>fabulous but you are<br>exposed to this working reality and<br>getting a sense of what that work<br>culture is so<br>internships are a fantastic opportunity<br>some of you who are attending might have<br>seen the language consultancy project<br>now that's slightly different from an<br>internship and<br>in simple terms we have great<br>partnerships as part of our programs<br>with local businesses<br>ngos etc who come onto campus<br>and put business problems to students<br>who then have to consult and come up<br>with solutions<br>so that's the a very simple explanation<br>of a consultancy project<br>so that's quite different uh because<br>you're not<br>working on site as it were but<br>nonetheless you are exposed to that<br>industry<br>and you do make connections that sort of<br>open up pathways to other networking<br>opportunities<br>and then of course undertaking a<br>research project is not necessarily<br>meaning that you<br>are part of a working team with a role<br>you might be on site researching a<br>particular phenomena<br>and that in itself is a is a different<br>kind of learning reality<br>but again it's still exposing you to a<br>particular work context and perhaps your<br>research project is going to be<br>something that that work context really<br>wants to embrace and learn more about<br>and that's the thing that's going to<br>lead to a pathway to a career so<br>that kind of reflects on some of the<br>things that lachlan was sharing with us<br>with his own research<br>so i have another question here from<br>a participant and this is really<br>relating to<br>alzena and the question is if you could<br>talk about this alzena and that is<br>what are some of the what are the job<br>prospects like<br>in this post-covert environment for<br>those<br>students who are com completing a<br>master's of professional accounting in<br>new zealand<br>sure so um with regards to job prospects<br>well they are available in the market if<br>you go to search for them<br>that's the very first thing i'd like to<br>say um point two is i think it's got to<br>do with the way as to how you<br>um portray yourself for the job so<br>there's no job certainty anywhere<br>and it gets quite tedious when you try<br>to portray yourself<br>in a market which is dying out anyway at<br>every instance it's just how you make a<br>difference so<br>the key is i think making connections<br>um building the clientele and then<br>getting forward for a job<br>um if i have to put it into perspective<br>um<br>almost prior to covert or rather just a<br>month prior to covered when we didn't<br>know what's going to hit us<br>i started searching for jobs and i<br>got the job within four months of the<br>course despite not completing the course<br>so i mean that speaks volumes if you<br>know how to portray yourself<br>i think it works wonders and you need to<br>also establish the ground that<br>there are situations where not every<br>person gets the job<br>but you need to still buck yourself up<br>and understand<br>how can you do better um for any job<br>that's available so<br>in terms of prospects there are<br>prospects because despite<br>despite the cobra troubles i think every<br>business is trying to understand how<br>they can keep their world afloat<br>and accountants are highly responsible<br>for that but because we're not just<br>looking at numbers we're actually trying<br>to fine-tune them and understand where<br>you can cut costs and<br>you know make a livelihood out of<br>whatever is messy out here<br>so i think that would be my answer to<br>that question<br>yeah okay thanks for that yeah i think<br>one of the core messages that<br>uh i picked up on that story alzena was<br>that<br>it's about how you're presenting<br>yourself and how you're selling your<br>strengths as it were<br>and sometimes that doesn't come<br>naturally to everybody and there are<br>great resources on<br>campus to learn how to do that as a side<br>example we recently had a<br>professional development session for<br>some of our executive masters of<br>business administration<br>students that was actually put on by our<br>career service<br>and that was about how to network how to<br>use linkedin effectively<br>and a whole lot of guidance on the art<br>of networking in order to increase the<br>likelihood that you'll be<br>offered jobs sort of an<br>unofficial channels if you like so not<br>having to go through sequel not going<br>having to go through<br>public kind of job advertising contexts<br>so i just thought i'd bring that up<br>because there are so many resources for<br>students<br>in fact there was um a medium for me to<br>understand how to first chalk your cv<br>into a market which you haven't had<br>before and i did route myself through<br>careers and employment of victoria and i<br>understood um<br>what is expected from a cv at this<br>juncture of your life when you're here<br>and<br>you've not penetrated into the market<br>before so you have um no one at the<br>first instance to talk to or understand<br>how the market works<br>but i think that was the very first<br>icebreaker for me and from there on i<br>think i've built<br>excellent connections till date i'm<br>hoping that i can put them to you<br>someday but it's been it's been great<br>yeah oh that's great feedback so i have<br>another question here which relates to<br>careers<br>um which is tailored to you lachlan but<br>other people might be able to reflect on<br>it<br>in their context um and lachlan that is<br>uh let me just put this up live here for<br>you so you can see it<br>are there also a variety of ages and<br>experiences<br>of you know so diverse age range of<br>people in the policy analyst<br>field because this person has got<br>extensive experience<br>uh working in consultancy<br>and how does that work for people who<br>want to change careers and<br>work in a policy context if they go on<br>and do a professional program like the<br>master of public policy<br>as a career change um lachlan are you<br>able to comment on whether<br>the the reality of policy analyst uh<br>employment and jobs<br>from your perspective is all about<br>recent graduates<br>or are you seeing a sort of more diverse<br>audience working in that context<br>i hope i've put that correctly it's a<br>great question<br>um from from my experience and i can't<br>speak for all ministries and departments<br>um yes it is quite diverse um the grad<br>program is quite small<br>um from my experience for most<br>government um<br>agencies because there are although<br>there is a finite group there's a group<br>of<br>policy analysts and policy people who do<br>circulate around<br>um i'm one of the younger people here<br>i think the younger i'm the youngest of<br>my in my team and directorate um by<br>about five or ten years um<br>but that yeah there's lots of people<br>coming in from industry as well as<br>um from postgraduate programs um<br>especially in my team there's a lot of<br>people who have gone through<br>phds or masters at universities and come<br>in so<br>yes it does depend on where you want to<br>go<br>but as far as applying goes as far as<br>i'm aware<br>most government agencies have a<br>recruitment<br>app or website that you can go to and<br>that shows all of the roles that you<br>might be<br>applicable for um and my recommendation<br>generally if you're applying for<br>government if you think it applies to<br>you apply<br>i didn't go through the grad program i<br>just applied for for a job<br>and i got it and i think doing a<br>professional program<br>postgraduate um really valuable because<br>that does actually carry quite a bit of<br>weight and<br>um as well going on what we said before<br>presenting yourself in<br>a good light is really helpful<br>especially in the sort of government<br>policy area<br>so if i can just add on to that i worked<br>the uh dock the department of<br>conservation for<br>almost three years and i also worked in<br>some crown research institutes which<br>aren't<br>a kind of government but cannot um<br>government organizations loves the<br>comments which is when you take someone<br>out of their job somewhere<br>and shove them in a different job where<br>they can learn a whole bunch of new<br>things so<br>government organizations within them<br>they don't expect<br>everyone to know 100 of everything all<br>of the time in fact they love shuffling<br>people around<br>so that they can learn new skills so<br>things<br>aren't um like pointed towards like<br>younger graduates at all in fact they<br>love people with diverse experiences<br>and i just say for employers as a whole<br>the main thing<br>that they love is soft skills which<br>actually people who have been in the<br>workplace before<br>have a big advantage over graduates<br>because they've already developed<br>all those soft skills from working<br>before<br>so i would say that like it's absolutely<br>not a disadvantage to be older or to not<br>have<br>experience in that particular field<br>especially when you're going to work for<br>government<br>because then they are looking for those<br>other skills<br>as well and because they have kind of<br>lower expectations<br>especially because they don't pay as<br>much as the private industry<br>so you know you've kind of you're in a<br>thanks for uh rhiannon i uh agree with<br>that too<br>and i must say that um in the day-to-day<br>course of<br>working down here in the professional<br>programs office that<br>it's very common for me to meet with<br>people who<br>come from extremely diverse backgrounds<br>today alone i've met with somebody who<br>came in with been working in a science<br>context<br>they'd been doing an environmental<br>science program and they were doing a<br>complete career shift<br>where they had sort of no particular<br>policy experience at all but they were<br>now wanting to do a master of public<br>policy because they realized that's what<br>they wanted to do<br>um and i was looking at them thinking<br>wow they've got so much<br>additional kind of career capital that<br>they can bring to that role<br>and that lends itself to amazing<br>discussions and kind of<br>student community collectiveness with<br>this<br>diverse feeding in of people from<br>different backgrounds so<br>i would actively encourage anybody who's<br>thinking about changing<br>their career direction to pursue<br>whatever it is that they want to study<br>at the end of the day all roads lead to<br>government and wellington<br>everybody's connected to it somehow so i<br>think everybody's experience is<br>relevance<br>relevant to the realities of uh policy<br>yeah definitely don't<br>undervalue that range in career capital<br>that you've already built up like range<br>absolutely now i've got two more<br>questions here to answer<br>and i'm going to wrap it up after that<br>but would actively encourage everybody<br>to email in as many questions as you<br>like so we can get a little bit more<br>specific on particular courses<br>because i know we might have glossed<br>over some of the details here<br>that's no problem at all and of course<br>people are welcome to book in a time to<br>come and chat with me if that's<br>something that you feel comfortable<br>doing<br>but back to these questions i have one<br>here and that is<br>uh can the master of professional<br>accounting<br>chartered accountancy pathway be<br>completed by those<br>who have an accounting undergraduate<br>major<br>who are a domestic student now<br>i can actually answer that as i<br>understand it yes<br>they are now encouraging students who<br>have an accounting major and a bcom<br>to apply for the master of professional<br>accounting<br>precisely for that reason so that you<br>can undertake that<br>chartered accountancy pathway and we're<br>finding that<br>this is just uh anecdotal feedback<br>that in the job marketplace where<br>accountancy accounting positions are<br>concerned<br>that that master of professional<br>accounting really is a well recognised<br>uh and perhaps this is a personal<br>opinion thing shared with us uh<br>preferred by some employers versus a<br>comparable<br>undergraduate pathway so the short<br>answer is yes<br>so i would encourage the person who<br>posted that great question just to reach<br>out to me so i can give you some more<br>precise<br>information on what that would look like<br>in terms of an enrollment<br>and course planning reality for you so<br>and here's another question this is<br>another question about the master of<br>global business<br>uh it's a bit of a hard question for me<br>to answer the question is can you tell<br>uh after covert what kind of changes in<br>tour in the tourism industry there might<br>be in terms of employment<br>we might expect and what kind of new<br>opportunities this situation<br>has brought or might bring or i can see<br>a hand going up there<br>is that rihanna yeah sorry so um<br>that's specialization but uh i was still<br>at doc during the last bit of<br>doing the first bit of kind of the<br>covered shake-up<br>and i was working in the concessions<br>part so dealing quite closely with a lot<br>of tourism operators<br>especially in the south island and the<br>biggest thing that we talked<br>about was how they're going to have to<br>change from focusing<br>solely on um the international market<br>to having things for like um<br>our tourists like people within the<br>country so you know a lot of experiences<br>are really uh not not geared<br>towards new zealanders helicopter<br>flights you know all that sort of stuff<br>which is<br>traditionally really expensive and um<br>also a lot of guided walking so us kiwis<br>we would if we want to go on a track<br>then we'll just give it a go<br>you know we'll just we'll just go by<br>ourselves but you know<br>the tourists they want to go with<br>someone and they want to<br>pay someone to explain everything to<br>make sure they don't fall down a cliff<br>you know so um there's gonna have to be<br>a lot of rethinking about how they<br>target<br>their activities and also the cost of<br>their activities<br>and that's something that we were<br>considering a lot in pricing our<br>concessions and all of that<br>sort of thing so yeah huge shifts but<br>also<br>a lot of new opportunities to work<br>better<br>within their communities and find new<br>niches<br>thanks for that rhiannon and i'll also<br>add to that question as well<br>watching people come into the programs<br>at the moment and starting with their<br>orientation and everybody sitting out on<br>this study journey<br>i actually think it's a really exciting<br>time<br>to start studying now in relation to<br>this great question about<br>well what's employment going to look<br>like in a tourism context and indeed<br>other contexts after covert because<br>you're actually going to be working on<br>those problems<br>discussing those problems and hopefully<br>solving the problems that we now have<br>left in the wake of covet so<br>it's actually amazingly timely to be<br>studying because you're going to reflect<br>in your career and go well<br>i learned how to problem solve and deal<br>with those changes<br>and i actually came up with solutions<br>and innovations as part of my learning<br>journey<br>which i then took into a career context<br>so<br>yeah things are a little bit scary and<br>uncertain at<br>the moment but there is certainly an<br>advantage and value in studying at the<br>moment<br>and working on these very problems<br>particularly in the tourism space i<br>think<br>that's something that i've noticed and i<br>think that will be of enormous value to<br>people coming into our programs at the<br>moment<br>i'm go i'm mindful that there is one<br>question here<br>um which is just a general statement<br>master of public policy i don't have a<br>public policy student<br>with us so what i would say to that is<br>uh i'm hoping that i can just reach out<br>to you by email<br>and start a bit of a conversation and<br>would happily have a<br>one-on-one zoom or appointment with you<br>to really get into the nuts and bolts of<br>the public policy program<br>we are going to have to wrap up this<br>webinar because we've gone past<br>the 615 mark i would just like to say to<br>everybody who's<br>been on our panel thank you so much for<br>sharing your experiences<br>and also thank you so much to everybody<br>who asked questions<br>uh they were great questions um it's an<br>interesting time as i've said earlier to<br>be studying<br>there's uncertainty but there's<br>excitement that goes with that<br>there's definitely loads of<br>opportunities that i can see in<br>wellington at the moment i can see that<br>the employment market is very robust so<br>there's lots of positive signs about<br>what lies ahead<br>for our future graduates so i think<br>everybody should be highly motivated by<br>that<br>but for now i'm going to stop talking<br>and as i said before i will reach out to<br>everybody to follow up on any additional<br>questions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
