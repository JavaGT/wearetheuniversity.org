introduce the<br>student<br>speaker for this ceremony michaela kerr<br>michael has graduated today with a<br>bachelor of engineering with honours in<br>software engineering<br>growing up in nelson michaela developed<br>a keen interest in programming and<br>in technology alongside competing<br>internationally in<br>road cycling excuse me and this led to<br>her undertaking a bachelor of<br>engineering with honours<br>at the university of waikato and<br>she also received a sir edmund hillary<br>scholarship<br>in order to pursue her sport and her<br>academic studies<br>michaela has developed a keen interest<br>in the energy sector<br>completing two internships at mercury<br>and her honours project in this area<br>as a result mikhail is moving to<br>wellington in january to start a<br>developer role<br>at transpower ladies and gentlemen would<br>you please welcome to the podium to give<br>the graduate address<br>you are a korfai tree continually<br>reaching and growing<br>constantly seeking perfection in the<br>form of yourself<br>much like a qualify we live what we<br>consider a lifetime<br>and over this lifetime we change we grow<br>and experience<br>expanding ourselves and our knowledge<br>however a quaffer has an advantage over<br>us<br>they do not expect change they expect<br>constants<br>patterns weather sunlight seasons these<br>are predictable cycles<br>which we as humans focus on less and<br>less because they matter less and less<br>to our lives<br>we have raincoats and cars and<br>fireplaces and food and<br>we can adapt to most situations quite<br>rapidly<br>a quaffer does not have the same<br>advantage<br>because we expect so much change change<br>we've become adept at ignoring it<br>we get told to change constantly we grow<br>up<br>we go to university we get a job we<br>learn and change and<br>people are always telling you or at<br>least they're telling me change is a<br>good thing<br>however the change people are thinking<br>of as the verb<br>to make or become different as if change<br>occurs overnight<br>that it is a constant that we can rely<br>on instead i've learned that change is a<br>cycle<br>this is the noun form an act or process<br>through which something becomes<br>different and that is something to us<br>or in this case me like a qualify seeing<br>sunlight<br>it knows it wants to grow towards the<br>sun so it will reach and grow<br>towards its end result directing any<br>resources there it can<br>to help it achieve that purpose<br>fundamentally the qualify will grow<br>a constant change cycle of reaching and<br>growing<br>if there is one thing that changes<br>taught me there is no one element to it<br>and like any cycle it keeps going<br>and growing just like a corfide tree<br>just like life<br>however change is not as simple as<br>saying so which is something i've been<br>learning for quite a while<br>so much of my life before university was<br>spent trying to get into university<br>and once i was here i knew i was here<br>but i didn't really understand what i<br>was doing<br>i was making friends i was racing my<br>bike i was learning a lot<br>but i wasn't really doing anything i was<br>not reaching<br>and therefore i could not grow<br>regardless<br>many of us here will retain a sense of<br>nostalgia for our university days<br>re-telling stories of each year how our<br>memories guide our future<br>is up to each of us yet our nostalgia<br>will remain<br>we remember our lecturers our professors<br>our guiding tutors<br>who all helped us to be able to walk<br>across the stage today<br>just as each year prior to us no doubt<br>graduating will be retained<br>as a beautiful memory for us to<br>reminisce about with our family and<br>friends in the coming years<br>every friend we make is connected to us<br>from the past few years and for this<br>thank you to everyone here for being<br>that someone to talk to when your friend<br>or family needed it<br>university is full of challenges and<br>what we tend to forget<br>is that life outside of university<br>coursework does exist<br>so to every supportive person here thank<br>you for supporting your friends<br>your classmates your whanau that is<br>something that is not written on your<br>university transcript<br>but you should be proud of it to the<br>university of waikato the chancellor<br>vice chancellor thank you for allowing<br>us this opportunity to graduate in 2020<br>thank you for bringing us together and<br>thank you for everyone here<br>without us all preparing to change our<br>lives for reaching<br>for a future we cannot see we would not<br>be here<br>so thank you hopefully our futures will<br>allow us to embark on growth<br>which allows us to bloom a room full of<br>monarch<br>be<br>thank you michaela and thank you to all<br>of you<br>uh our graduates your families friends<br>and supporters who've attended<br>this graduation ceremony this morning<br>today graduates you've been admitted to<br>the community of scholars<br>at this university though you may have<br>completed<br>your formal association with the<br>university as a
