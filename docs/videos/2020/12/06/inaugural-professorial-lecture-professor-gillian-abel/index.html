accurate.</p><p>my name is paul brunton and i have the<br>privilege to be the pvc found sciences<br>and i'm very pleased to welcome you all<br>here tonight to jillian's inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>which i'm sure we're looking forward to<br>now normally the vc would be here and do<br>the official welcome but unfortunately<br>she couldn't be here<br>and she did desperately want me to send<br>her apologies<br>um she's unfortunately committing<br>elsewhere julian so she's very sorry<br>that she couldn't be here because<br>we always enjoy these ipl events so the<br>highlight of the academic year<br>to see our colleagues promoted is a<br>fantastic thing<br>and it's a great way for them to<br>introduce themselves to their community<br>in their new role as a professor and<br>it's an opportunity to celebrate your<br>success<br>and i'm sure it will go very very well<br>to become a professor in this university<br>is<br>a task in itself we've just done the<br>professorial promotion<br>round for this year and it is a very<br>difficult process i have to say<br>and therefore to succeed through that<br>process is testament to the quality of<br>your research your teaching<br>and your contributions to service and<br>it's richly deserved<br>so i look forward to hearing your<br>lecture and again welcome everybody to<br>this evening and particularly those<br>joining us on zoom from afar<br>you're very very welcome and i'm sure<br>you'll enjoy the evening and without<br>more of a video i'll pass over to david<br>just checking you can hear i think it's<br>yes can you hear<br>the microphone just great<br>um for those who don't know me my name<br>is david murdock i'm the<br>the dean and head of campus here at the<br>university of otago in christchurch<br>and one of my great pleasures and my<br>role is to introduce<br>all of our inaugural professorial<br>lecturers and and it's a great privilege<br>to be able to introduce jillian tonight<br>as many of us know jillian originally<br>comes from south africa but<br>probably not all of us would know that<br>she actually had a career<br>before she went into public health<br>jillian trained as a<br>medical technologist and for a new<br>zealand parlance we'd call a medical<br>laboratory scientist now<br>and she uh trained in medical technology<br>at grutaskura hospital in cape town<br>graduating in 1981 and for a few years<br>after that was a medical technologist<br>specializing in hematology in the cape<br>town area<br>1996 she and her family migrated to new<br>zealand<br>and then she tells me she decided she<br>needed a change in career<br>and the following year in 1997 she<br>joined<br>what was then the our department of<br>public health and general practice first<br>as a research fellow<br>then as a assistant research fellow<br>junior research fellow<br>search fellow lecturer senior lecturer<br>etc<br>and during that time also studied<br>public health so postgraduate diploma in<br>public health master in public health<br>and then phd all here on this campus<br>graduating with a phd in 2010.<br>in about 2013 the department<br>split into department of general<br>practice in the department of<br>and or public health became the<br>department of population health<br>and gillian was our inaugural head of<br>department<br>of in the department of population<br>health<br>and has held that role ever since and<br>during her time with us<br>has really developed quite an extensive<br>record as a<br>as a teacher as a postgraduate<br>supervisor and<br>and at times has contributed to our<br>medical program<br>jillian's research expertise is in<br>community-based participatory approaches<br>using mixed methods<br>to look at vulnerable populations and<br>when talking about vulnerable<br>populations we're<br>looking here at those groups who are<br>marginalized or excluded in society<br>including sex workers<br>particular groups of young people such<br>as those in foster care<br>and people living with hiv infection and<br>jillian's work with all of those groups<br>and i think it's fair to say that she<br>has been a major force<br>in our behind our strength and in<br>qualitative research here on the<br>jenny is most well known for her<br>expertise in the field of research on<br>sex work<br>and is really a genuine world<br>leader and world opinion leader in this<br>area<br>new zealand became the first country to<br>to decriminalize sex work in 2003 when<br>the prostitution reform act was passed<br>and jillian was the lead investigator<br>following that with a<br>large national project funded by the<br>health research council looking at the<br>impact of the act<br>on the health and safety of sex workers<br>and<br>that piece of work and other work that<br>she has led have been hugely influential<br>both<br>here in new zealand and globally<br>she has developed an extensive global<br>network of collaborators<br>and recently with some of those<br>collaborators who has received<br>funding from the economic and social<br>research council in the uk to do a four<br>country comparative study investigating<br>sexual violence and sex working<br>populations with a focus on<br>legal consciousness legal norms and<br>legal practice<br>as a global opinion leader she's often<br>called upon<br>to the media and i very very much very<br>well remember about five years ago<br>a debate that she held online with the<br>new york times on<br>should where the prostitution<br>prostitution should be a crime<br>in her lecture jillian's going to take<br>us through her journey through her sex<br>work research over the past<br>23 years and highlighting key public<br>health<br>messages so jillian welcome you to the<br>stage<br>thank you so much for coming along to<br>listen to me talk about my research<br>journey in sex work<br>it's been a very long and pleasant<br>journey and i'm hoping to take you on a<br>trip<br>through sex work tonight um but i<br>thought before i<br>got started i'd give you i just<br>embellished a bit on some of the<br>my pre-sex work life as<br>and highlight some of the things that<br>david had had<br>already said so i was born in cape town<br>and<br>i spent the first 36 years of my life<br>there<br>but my roots go back to england so<br>my father's parents were from london and<br>they emigrated to what was then southern<br>rhodesia it's now zimbabwe<br>just shortly before he was born and<br>there's my son he's just arrived<br>um so they immigrated to um<br>southern rhodesia and just when he was a<br>young boy they moved down to cape town<br>then when he was 19 he went up to north<br>africa to fight in the second world war<br>and he was there for um about a year and<br>a half before he was captured by the<br>germans<br>and he's that was in december 1941 he<br>spent the rest of the war in pow camps<br>in it's mainly in italy and then towards<br>the end of the war in germany<br>after the war they sent him across to<br>england and he was in a camp in brighton<br>where he was waiting to be shipped back<br>to south africa and it was there in<br>brighton that he met my mother who was<br>born in brighton<br>so he was shipped back to cape town<br>within a few months my mother followed<br>him<br>and four days after she arrived in cape<br>town they got married and that's<br>photo on their right on the right taken<br>on their wedding day<br>so they very quickly had three children<br>quick succession<br>and for almost 10 years they thought<br>their family was complete<br>my two sisters and my brother and then<br>1960 arrived and surprised so did i<br>and yeah they got used to me after a<br>while<br>and the picture at the bottom is a<br>picture of my mother and i on brighton<br>beach when i was four years old we<br>sailed across to england to visit the<br>family in brighton<br>so i grew up in a suburb called<br>pinelands in cape town plans was quite a<br>lovely suburb to grow up in and it's got<br>three<br>primary schools which feed one high<br>school and the primary schools are very<br>imaginatively called the red school the<br>blue school and the green school<br>and i went to the red school as my<br>siblings had done before me<br>and then obviously on to pineman's high<br>school the pictures there are my first<br>year of school<br>and the other one's my last year in<br>school<br>i did enjoy school i've got some<br>pleasant memories of it mainly because<br>that's where my friends were<br>but i did okay academically as well but<br>it got towards the end of school<br>and i didn't really know what i was<br>going to do after i left school i had no<br>strong vocational calling but my<br>sister-in-law<br>worked in the as a medical technologist<br>at kreutzke hospital and she<br>took me around to see the labs and i<br>thought this will do<br>and i applied to get into medical<br>technology<br>um but it was quite a thing to get in<br>so they had a cat amount of students<br>they would take every year and the year<br>that i was going 1978 they'd kept it at<br>12<br>and there were 110 applicants so i<br>thought i better have a backup plan<br>and somebody told me about radiography<br>so i applied for that<br>and i got in but i had to keep it on<br>hold for a while until i heard back from<br>medical technology and i got my letter<br>and that i've been<br>accepted and so i started in 1978 at<br>fruit scare hospital well it was<br>scrutzka hospital and the medical school<br>so two of the labs were in the medical<br>school that was histology and<br>bacteriology<br>and then hematology and chemical<br>pathology were in the hospital<br>so nowadays you for this qualification<br>you'd have to go to university full-time<br>for three years before going into the<br>labs<br>but in those days you kind of trained on<br>the job so i was based in the labs and<br>attended lectures as well<br>my first lab that i went into so i was<br>straight from school i was in histology<br>and i arrived first day in astrology<br>bright eyed and they told me i was<br>going to be in the post-mortem lab so i<br>went straight from school<br>to the mortuary and i enjoyed it<br>quite a lot so for the first two years<br>of this qualification you<br>we had to rotate through the four labs<br>and<br>go to lectures and sit exams and<br>including chemistry which i'd never done<br>at school<br>and so it was quite a steep learning<br>curve i absolutely hated it<br>i couldn't see the point in knowing how<br>carbon atoms were joined together<br>but we got through the exam with that<br>and i<br>did and after two years you had to<br>choose which lab you were going to<br>specialise in and i<br>chose to specialise in hematology so i<br>sent spent another<br>two years there studying hematology and<br>working in the lab<br>and 1981 was quite a big year<br>it was the year i got married to martin<br>and then i turned 21 while i was on<br>honeymoon with the dog<br>and it was also the year i qualified in<br>hematology<br>then in 1984 we had claire<br>and in 86 we had mike who's here tonight<br>unfortunately claire couldn't come<br>so yes when i had claire i resigned from<br>full-time work but<br>we needed the money so i did go back<br>part-time and i locumed at kritzker<br>hospital i looked for private<br>pathologists<br>i got involved in two research projects<br>um<br>so i did a few mornings a week doing the<br>lab work for those<br>projects and then in 1990 the year<br>claire started school i took a<br>position in a high school as a<br>laboratory technician<br>and i stayed there for six years until<br>1996 when we<br>immigrated to new zealand so it was<br>quite a big move for us we didn't have<br>jobs to come to<br>we just sold our house resigned from our<br>jobs packed up<br>and decided to leave we thought well<br>we'll pick berries if we have to<br>and we have my brother-in-law and sister<br>who'd been in new zealand<br>they immigrated here when i was still in<br>high school<br>so we had them and so we had some family<br>here and we were lucky that<br>within six weeks of us arriving in<br>december 1996<br>martin got a job at a company called<br>switch tech hearing<br>christchurch so i didn't have to go and<br>pick berries<br>and you can see in this picture we've<br>got our first new zealand dog katie<br>the dashant so i've always had dogs ever<br>since i was born i've<br>loved dogs and the ones on the left are<br>a pack we had just before we<br>emigrated four dogs and a cat who<br>thought he was a dog<br>and the ones on the right are present<br>for babies<br>ragnar and alice<br>and also what i like doing outside of<br>work is lawn bowls<br>and this picture was taken in january<br>when our team had just won the the<br>sevens<br>final the championship canterbury<br>championship seventh<br>final and we were supposed to go and<br>play for a national title in april but<br>covert put pay to that so we're going to<br>have to try our best to<br>get to the same position this season and<br>for those of you who think you're too<br>young to play bowls please note that<br>but you'll be relieved to know that i<br>so a lot of people ask me how i got into<br>doing research and sex work and i think<br>sometimes i think that i'm a bit of<br>enigma to the people<br>in the medical school<br>but i think it was an accident i didn't<br>i didn't<br>purposely decide i was going to sex work<br>actually chose me<br>so i said we didn't have jobs when we<br>arrived in the country i applied for<br>everything i saw in the paper that i<br>thought i could possibly do not sex work<br>but i<br>applied for a lot of jobs<br>and one of them was for this research<br>assistant<br>in the public health and general<br>practice at the school of medicine<br>and i thought it didn't have any<br>information about what<br>the research was about but i thought<br>well i've worked in<br>a medical school and i've done research<br>so i'm perfectly suited for this job<br>so i went off and i got i got an<br>interview and i went off to the<br>interview and it was in<br>cambridge terrace that's where the<br>department was located<br>and where mihi are now and<br>um the re the interview panel was<br>professor jane chatwin who was at that<br>stage head of department<br>and dr libby plumbridge who was the pi<br>on the research<br>and dr ruth helms who was our department<br>administrator<br>and it was there that i found out what<br>the research was about they said well it<br>was located in the public health<br>side of the department and it was<br>looking at the safer sex in the<br>christchurch sex<br>industry and the research involved a<br>survey and<br>interviews with sex workers so inside i<br>was thinking well i don't think i can<br>say anything intelligent about public<br>health<br>and neither could i say anything<br>intelligent about sex work<br>and i didn't know that social research<br>methods was a thing<br>so but i said that's interesting we got<br>through the interview<br>in including the test i had to do on<br>word which recent<br>set for me and ruth i've got to make a<br>confession said that you had to be<br>proficient in word<br>but i'd only used word perfect in south<br>africa so i didn't know word<br>so when i was called for an interview i<br>had four days with a manual on how to<br>do work and i missed it enough to pass<br>that test<br>um so yes i<br>started here at the school in 1997<br>knowing absolutely nothing about public<br>health even less about sex work<br>but i improved i did learn a lot i did<br>as<br>david said i did the postgraduate<br>diploma in public health and the masters<br>and the<br>phd in public health and i did a lot<br>more research<br>on sex work so i've landed up here in<br>2020 as a professor in public health and<br>seen as a world expert in sex work<br>research<br>so i thought i'd take you on the journey<br>of some of the of the studies that i've<br>done around sex work<br>i have done other research but i'm not<br>going to talk about those<br>today and before we get to those i just<br>want to say that i<br>take a community-based participatory<br>research approach to all my<br>research so traditional<br>methods traditional research methods the<br>researcher kind of poses the problem<br>what they want to research they go about<br>doing the research they analyze<br>look at their findings and they might<br>make recommendations on where to from<br>there<br>but a participatory approach kind of<br>turns that on its head<br>it starts from the bottom up and it sees<br>that the community needs to actually<br>identify the problems that are important<br>for them<br>to have research done on so if you look<br>at a lot of public health research<br>that's done around sex work<br>most of it is done on sexual health<br>because a lot of researchers see that as<br>the most important issue<br>for sex workers but when you talk to sex<br>workers that's not the most<br>important thing there's a whole lot of<br>other things which are far more<br>important than sexual health in fact<br>they're really good at<br>ensuring their sexual health so i've<br>worked with nzpc<br>all the way along the line in all the<br>research so work with them i'm guided by<br>catherine dan catherine healey is<br>luckily with us today she was<br>one of the co-founders of nzpc<br>and we've got sue here as well from the<br>christchurch branch<br>thank you very much for coming so yes<br>a lot of all of the time really i'm<br>guided by ncpc as to what the issues are<br>i need to be doing research on and then<br>working with them through the whole<br>research process through all the stages<br>so that<br>i know that i'm right i'm asking the<br>right questions in the research<br>um also once i've done the analysis i<br>give it to catherine who looks and often<br>she's got a different perspective a<br>different take on it<br>which then i can incorporate into what i<br>write up<br>and also it's about finding out from sex<br>workers what they think will work if<br>there's going to be an intervention<br>whether it's a policy whether it's<br>a health promotion initiative that we<br>know that once that's put in place it's<br>grounded in the knowledge and the<br>experience of sex workers<br>so it's going to be therefore more<br>acceptable to sex workers and then<br>therefore more effective so<br>on many of the slides when i introduce<br>the studies you'll see this logo at the<br>bottom<br>so this is recognized internationally as<br>a symbol to end violence against sex<br>work<br>sex workers and this is the<br>nzpc's logo and they've kiwified it by<br>incorporating the silver fern into the<br>red umbrella and i put it on the slides<br>because<br>this is not just me doing the research<br>this is a partnership and this<br>recognises that<br>this is research that we have done<br>together<br>so yes i'm going to go through the<br>studies i can't the eight studies i want<br>to cover and i can't actually go into<br>detail about all of them some of them<br>had quite a lot of findings so i'm just<br>going to pick one key public health<br>message take a message for you<br>from each of these studies<br>so the start of my journey was that<br>study that liberty plumbridge<br>led and it was funded by the health<br>research council<br>looking at safer sex in the christchurch<br>sex industry and i might need to just<br>get my notes here in case i get lost<br>um so the context for this was that sex<br>work in new zealand was still<br>criminalized at that time<br>but ncpc were campaigning for<br>decriminalisation<br>and libya and james had engaged with<br>nzpc<br>towards the beginning of the 1990s when<br>they did some studies<br>um on clients of sex workers<br>but uh um but nzpc also you know were<br>wanting<br>some research which would give some<br>indication of the state of play what was<br>happening in sex work in the country at<br>that time<br>that they could use maybe in their<br>arguments for decriminalization<br>so we did the study it was quite a<br>we did a survey of 303 i think it was<br>sex workers in christchurch which was at<br>that stage about 80 percent of the sex<br>worker population at that time<br>and we did interviews with 32 sex<br>workers longitudinally<br>so multiple interviews here in<br>christchurch and in wellington<br>um so<br>some some people were interviewed up to<br>five times in an 18-month period<br>so one of the questions that we asked<br>around<br>in the survey was around adverse<br>experiences sex workers had had<br>in their time in sex work and as you can<br>see by<br>these figures in this table it's quite<br>the prevalence is quite high<br>and it's especially high for<br>street-based sex workers<br>compared to indoor workers and they<br>experience more and more severe forms of<br>violence we know that street-based sex<br>workers are more vulnerable to<br>violence but the thing is when<br>their sex work was criminalized none of<br>these events got reported to the police<br>because sex workers would not report to<br>the police because then they'll be<br>outing themselves as being involved in<br>illegal activities<br>and when we asked them about reporting<br>to the police they also said the police<br>wouldn't care<br>and they would also and they said the<br>police would blame them and say they put<br>themselves<br>in that themselves in that position<br>and police were seen as the enemy there<br>was entrapment going on so it was<br>illegal to solicit by the way so<br>you couldn't ask for money for sex but<br>it wasn't illegal to offer money for sex<br>so there's a bit of a double standard<br>that was going on there<br>but police would then pose as clients to<br>try and entrap<br>sex workers into asking for money they<br>also<br>seized condoms as evidence of<br>so yes when very few<br>the relationship between police and sex<br>workers was not good and very few<br>incidents were reported and if we look<br>in the brothels there was a lot of<br>exploitation going on there<br>there was brothel operators were<br>charging shift fees<br>of sex workers regardless of whether<br>they got a client or not so sometimes<br>they<br>they actually lost money by going into<br>work<br>they were fine for minor offenses like<br>having a letter in their stocking being<br>late so they take her money was often<br>very<br>small they had they could not refuse to<br>see a client<br>if they'd had a bad experience with that<br>client before<br>if they knew that person from their<br>personal life they<br>were not allowed to refuse<br>and they had very little say over what<br>services they<br>could they would provide and i'll just<br>pause when i put up quite so i can have<br>a<br>drink of water and you can read the<br>quote<br>so yeah and brothel operators sometimes<br>would want to try out<br>new sex workers didn't pay them and<br>sometimes didn't use a condom either<br>so really the message that i'm giving<br>you here is that criminalisation creates<br>creates an environment where<br>exploitation can happen because people<br>are safe in the knowledge that<br>they can do what they like and sex<br>workers will not report it<br>so they can get away with it the study<br>finished in 1999 and it was about the<br>same time that<br>nzpc had finished writing the<br>prostitution reform bill<br>so the prostitution reform bill was<br>written by sex workers for sex workers<br>was tidied up by a professor of law at<br>victoria university<br>and it was quite brief really and tim<br>barnett submitted it to parliament in<br>2000 as a private member's bill<br>and he spoke to it in all three readings<br>and he<br>drew on some of the evidence from the<br>study to argue that<br>the problem that sex work in and of<br>itself is not the problem it's not a<br>problem<br>it's the laws that criminalize sex work<br>that create the problems the<br>criminalization creates<br>um the harms and so he used this<br>harmonization argument and um<br>and the vote final vote happened in 2003<br>so the bull was in parliament for three<br>years it went<br>underwent a number of amendments the mps<br>couldn't keep their fingers out of it<br>and it grew and grew and grew so it's<br>quite a substantial document now<br>and some of those additions amendments<br>that were made to the bull<br>have been quite contentious and i'll<br>talk about one later on in the<br>in the talk um but the final vote<br>came in in june 2003 and<br>60 mps voted for 59 against and one<br>abstention so<br>sex work was decriminalized by a very<br>narrow margin<br>and we became the first country in the<br>world to decriminalize<br>new south wales had done so in 1995 but<br>it's the only<br>was the only state in australia to<br>decriminalise<br>and then last year northern territory<br>did but we remain the only country to<br>have decriminalized<br>so some people get a bit confused and<br>say well what about the netherlands and<br>germany<br>but actually that they are legalized not<br>decriminalizing there's a big difference<br>there<br>so decriminalization is where you get<br>rid of all the laws which criminalize<br>sex workers activities<br>and basically it runs under the same<br>conditions as any other occupation it's<br>a business like any other<br>ostensibly whereas legalization it's<br>only legal if you're working in a legal<br>brothel<br>so if you're working privately if you're<br>working on the street if you're working<br>in an<br>unlicensed brothel you're still<br>criminalized so that's the difference<br>between legalization and<br>decriminalization<br>so anyway after it was decriminalized<br>the<br>uh the emphasis then was well did it<br>work<br>was decriminalization a harm<br>minimization<br>strategy and were sex workers now better<br>off<br>after decrim so i applied as a<br>the pir was the pi on this study and the<br>co-investigators were lisa fitzgerald<br>who's now at the university of<br>queensland<br>and dr cheryl brunton who's still in the<br>department<br>and we put him for funding to the health<br>research council again and<br>they funded it and within a few weeks of<br>us getting this funding i got a call<br>from the ministry of justice<br>and they wanted to have a talk because<br>one of the amendments that went into the<br>act was<br>that the act was required to be<br>evaluated within five years of enactment<br>now very few policies get enacted with<br>that proviso that<br>evaluation proviso so they had set up a<br>prostitution law review committee under<br>the ministry of justice<br>but they now needed some research to do<br>their evaluation<br>and they wanted to they had very they<br>had four task areas they needed to cover<br>and they wanted to talk to us to see<br>well<br>what parts of would our research cover<br>all or some of those tasks that they had<br>to do<br>so in our talks with them and the law<br>review committee we<br>found out that we could we could inform<br>three of the tasks they had so<br>they contracted us to provide a report<br>to the<br>the review committee with by 2007.<br>only trouble was hrc money was to cover<br>the research<br>in christchurch wellington napier and<br>nelson<br>and obviously they wanted auckland<br>involved because that's where the<br>largest population of sex workers are<br>so the ministry of justice topped up<br>they gave us extra money to extend the<br>data collection<br>to auckland so it was a very large study<br>we did a survey<br>of 772 sex workers<br>and we did in-depth interviews with 58<br>sex workers<br>and we also did an estimation of the<br>number of workers so that was one of the<br>things in the prostitution reform act<br>a lot of mps thought that<br>decriminalizing everybody would want to<br>come and work in the industry and it<br>would just expand exponentially<br>so they wanted the instead we had to do<br>uh estimation at the time<br>that decriminalization came to be and<br>then one five years down to the track to<br>see if<br>the numbers had increased so we did that<br>as well<br>so i won't talk too much about the study<br>because i<br>am better shot on it in future ones but<br>just to say that<br>that sex workers the sex work<br>had changed dramatically it created a<br>safer environment where sex workers were<br>able to negotiate<br>what what services they would provide<br>condom use far easier than they could<br>prior to that<br>they could refuse to see clients they<br>didn't have to see clients they didn't<br>want to see<br>they could respond to exploitative<br>practices in brothels<br>their relationship with the policing<br>improved<br>and there were no increase in numbers<br>our estimation<br>showed that there had been a bit of a<br>movement so there were fewer sex workers<br>in brothels and more working privately<br>but overall numbers were<br>pretty much the same as they were prior<br>and the reason why i think<br>decriminalization<br>minimized harm was because sex workers<br>rights were recognized<br>so that we provided the report to the<br>prostitution law review committee and<br>their conclusion for looking at that<br>research and other bits of research that<br>they had done<br>was that sex workers were far safer<br>under decriminalization than they had<br>been before<br>and that there had been no negative<br>outcomes from<br>decriminalization<br>so what fell out of also that study was<br>um<br>in the prostitution reform act they<br>there was a statement about<br>exiting the sex industry and that um<br>we needed to assess the nature and<br>adequacy of the means available to<br>assist persons to avoid or cease working<br>as sex workers is quite a judgmental<br>statement that they had in the<br>prostitution reform act<br>it makes it sound like sex workers need<br>to be saved from<br>the sex industry and we know that<br>most of the sex workers i've spoken to<br>have freely chosen<br>to work in the sex industry and contrary<br>to popular opinion a lot of them<br>actually enjoy their work<br>the prostitutional law review committee<br>actually in their recommendations<br>softened this and said that we need to<br>look at the means of<br>helping people who want to leave the sex<br>industry<br>so this is what sort of was the impetus<br>for doing this piece of research which i<br>got funding from<br>the university of otago research grant<br>to undertake and i talked to people who<br>had<br>left sex work but<br>in many cases it's a yoyo or profession<br>that<br>people dip in and depart so really<br>you know they come into work they might<br>go get into a personal relationship and<br>leave for a while when that relationship<br>ends come back<br>sometimes have a bad experience and<br>leave then come back or just want to<br>break<br>so people the people i spoke to have<br>been in in and out a few times from<br>but they're two messages i want to give<br>from this<br>from the study firstly there are wider<br>structural<br>issues at play outside of sex work<br>that that influence entry into sex work<br>so<br>poverty is a driver for sex work<br>and six workers can earn more money and<br>have for more flexible hours and a lot<br>of other jobs that they could have<br>and money was always the reason for<br>people coming back<br>to sex work so for instance this<br>participant<br>most sex workers are women and most<br>vulnerable to poverty<br>many women in new zealand are in low<br>paid<br>female dominated occupations<br>and they're still a gender pay gap and<br>you and new zealand is not unique in<br>that single parent families<br>are at the bottom end of the scale in<br>terms of earnings and overall assets<br>and sex workers are often single parent<br>families and they choose<br>sex work in the face of very few other<br>the second message i want to give is<br>around stigma stigma is a determinant of<br>health<br>when sex work was decriminalized it<br>didn't change societal attitudes<br>so there's still stigma attached to sex<br>work and this<br>and sex workers have to contend with<br>this<br>in their everyday lives and it has<br>huge implications for their social and<br>mental<br>wellbeing so stigma<br>leads to discrimination and when you're<br>wanting to leave sex work<br>and you're wanting to get a job<br>elsewhere how do you explain the hole in<br>your cv<br>so very few people would put in that<br>they've been working in sex work because<br>the reality is that they probably<br>wouldn't even get an interview<br>so sex work kind of follows you're out<br>of out of sex<br>out of sex work um stigma follows you<br>and i put up that quote so you don't<br>leave the stigma behind when you leave<br>so this these are structural and<br>societal<br>issues and it's not issues with sex work<br>itself<br>the next study also kind of fell out of<br>the<br>larger impact of the pra study<br>and for this one i teamed up with<br>associate professor stephanie wehab<br>who at that stage was in the department<br>of sociology gender studies and social<br>work in dunedin<br>and she was from portland oregon and<br>she's since gone back there<br>and she had us she was an academic<br>social worker she had done<br>a lot of work around street involved<br>youth in the<br>in the states and i was also<br>particularly interested in this because<br>when i looked at the demographics<br>around street street-based sex work we<br>found that<br>29 of street-based sex workers<br>had started on the street<br>prior to the age of 16 and a further 28<br>had started between the ages 16 and 17.<br>so that's 57 of street based sex workers<br>have started sex work before the age of<br>18.<br>and the vast majority of those sex<br>workers have been in foster care<br>or in the child youth and family system<br>and i use sips because that was<br>what it was called in at this time i<br>now so a lot of the<br>the young people have been in foster<br>care they'd run away from foster care<br>landed up in the street and they were<br>selling sex to survive and another<br>group that of young people are<br>transgender young people who've known<br>from a very early age that they're in<br>the wrong body and it's<br>mainly male to female transgender and<br>they've been bullied at school<br>and um and often parents don't accept<br>their gender identity and they end up<br>running away they find<br>other people on the street like them and<br>they form quite strong bonds<br>there and their relationship with<br>with social workers is is quite fraught<br>so we did interviews with young people<br>on the street and we also did interviews<br>with social workers<br>and what we found was there really needs<br>to be institutional shifts<br>here the young people were really angry<br>they<br>said that they had no say in it they<br>were taken away from families they<br>understood they were angry with their<br>families they said that<br>you know they weren't the greatest<br>families but it was their family and<br>they were taken away often<br>and put in a foster care family we were<br>often no better than their own<br>and they were quite perceptive these<br>young people they<br>recognised that it wasn't necessarily<br>the social workers it was the<br>system which had very rigid guidelines<br>and the social workers we spoke to<br>reinforced this<br>they said you know that it's a really<br>risk of a risk-averse<br>environment that um if there's any risk<br>involved the<br>default position is to take the child<br>away<br>and in a way that it's it's they're<br>stuck between a rock and a hard place<br>really because if they know that the<br>child's at risk and they don't remove<br>the child and something happens then<br>it's them that have to<br>wear the blame but these young people<br>recognized it and they<br>um and they argued that things needed to<br>be uh<br>they needed to give more weight to what<br>the young people themselves felt<br>they felt that they weren't being heard<br>that<br>social workers didn't listen to what<br>they had to say<br>and basically there was very little<br>relationship<br>between them and social workers because<br>the caseworkers changed so often they<br>never actually<br>developed a relationship with any of the<br>social workers<br>so what i'm saying here is that it's<br>similar to the previous study i talked<br>about these are wider structural issues<br>and this is an organizational issue that<br>there needs to be shifts within the<br>organization we're still talking about<br>it now that it's around a tamariki<br>if you watch the news nowadays<br>the next study we wanted to look at<br>employment<br>in the sex industry again so we wanted<br>to look at brothels<br>explore the practices in brothels and<br>whether things had moved on now that's<br>decriminalization was well embedded and<br>got a york<br>to do this study well it was an otago<br>medical school grant that i<br>got and we did interviews with brothel<br>operators and with<br>sex workers and i would just want to<br>focus on one<br>section that was added to the pra here<br>that's section 16 which says that you<br>cannot compel<br>anybody to provide a commercial sexual<br>services<br>and sex workers and brothel operators<br>know the pra quite well<br>and so um you know<br>most most sex workers who work in<br>brothels work on shifts<br>and so if they don't feel like coming in<br>on a shift sometimes the<br>brothel operator will want to find them<br>to recoup some of the advertising costs<br>etc<br>but sex workers being quite clued up<br>are now saying well you can't do that<br>that's not legal<br>so there's been this kind of power shift<br>within brothels<br>so whereas brothel operators had all the<br>power<br>in the criminalized environment some<br>there's been this power shift<br>and now sex workers um don't have to put<br>up with<br>what and brothel operators are saying<br>that's very difficult to run a business<br>so if you're expecting five people to<br>work on a shift and three people say<br>they're not going to come<br>you know you don't have sex workers<br>there and you've also put<br>out quite a lot of money in advertising<br>so<br>yeah ncpc often play a mediating role<br>between<br>sex workers and brothel operators<br>and failing that there's also the human<br>rights tribunal and some sex workers<br>have taken<br>operators successfully to the human<br>rights tribunal<br>um but the game stigma comes into play<br>here as well<br>you can apply for name suppression<br>because<br>a lot of sex workers don't tell family<br>and friends that they're working<br>so they don't really want their name out<br>there so i can apply for name<br>suppression it's always<br>granted but there's that faint thought<br>that maybe it won't be granted this time<br>and so that threat to kind of<br>being exposed as working in the sex<br>industry sometimes prevents people<br>from going further up in the um through<br>so yeah decriminalisation has led to<br>labor rights but it's just that stigma<br>kind of still sitting there which<br>sometimes impedes them achieving those<br>rights<br>the next one we did well when i first<br>started doing<br>research most sex workers advertised in<br>the newspaper in the adult<br>section of the classifieds and was sort<br>of one or two<br>lines but things have changed somewhat<br>and most sex workers now will advertise<br>online<br>their web platforms that they can<br>advertise on<br>and we were wondering about whether this<br>would introduce new and different harm<br>so we thought we'd do a study on this<br>and i<br>i never heard of internet in new zealand<br>until then but i found them and they<br>funded research and they funded this<br>piece of research which was<br>very nice so<br>what we found that was sex workers had<br>really actively engaged in marketing<br>and they could market themselves two<br>ways through the photos that they used<br>on the websites<br>and also through the blurb that they<br>wrote so now they had a bigger space to<br>write<br>and market themselves um<br>and that could provide more detail but<br>the thing is there's a lot of<br>competition online<br>and if you don't pay the premium price<br>of about 170<br>a week you're not going to be on those<br>top pages and those web on those web<br>platforms<br>and you sink down somehow you've got to<br>stand out from<br>from the rest so there's been a growing<br>pressure<br>for sex workers to show their faces<br>in these photos so mostly now people are<br>sort of cut off at the neck or<br>strategically placed so that their face<br>is invisible<br>um tattoos are sort of airbrushed out<br>and so i'm no identifying information<br>but now there's this pressure you're<br>going to if you show your face you're<br>going to more likely<br>the danger here is that there's facial<br>recognition<br>software around and people can<br>use that to find their private facebook<br>sites<br>and find out what their real name is get<br>into their personal networks<br>and so there have been episodes of<br>online harassment and stalking threats<br>to privacy through use of personal<br>information<br>so yes there's internet has changed the<br>face of sex work<br>and we have to deal with those new<br>problems that<br>one of the amendments made to that which<br>i think was the most damaging was the<br>addition of section 19 into the act<br>which stated that you couldn't<br>migrants couldn't come into the country<br>on temporary visas<br>temporary work or student visas and work<br>in the sex industry<br>so in effect only new zealand residents<br>and citizens can work in<br>illegally in this country and<br>this part of uh this section was put in<br>because there was a fear by some mps<br>that<br>once it was decriminalized it would<br>encourage trafficking<br>into the country i don't know what that<br>was based on but there was this fear of<br>trafficking<br>and i was<br>i worked with dr michael rogusky who's a<br>private researcher in wellington<br>he and i were contracted by the ministry<br>of business innovation and employment to<br>look at the experiences<br>and what did we find we found yeah we<br>spoke to<br>several migrant workers here some of<br>them<br>didn't want to speak because obviously<br>very nervous if they found to be working<br>they can be deported<br>so some were nervous to talk to us we<br>spoke to but we found some who would<br>talk to us<br>and we spoke to people who support<br>migrant workers here as well<br>and they were being horribly exploited<br>because<br>um yeah it was similar to how it was<br>when sex work was criminalized for other<br>sex workers here<br>in that people could blackmail them<br>require them to provide services they<br>didn't want to provide<br>not pay them some clients don't didn't<br>pay some brothel operators withheld<br>money<br>and some some migrant workers were raped<br>and again none of them would report it<br>to the police because of fear of being<br>deported so that section of the act has<br>introduced<br>quite a lot of harm the unintended<br>consequences<br>those sex workers who could speak<br>english pretty well<br>and were white were less affected<br>because they could work in<br>brothels and if people ask them about<br>their accent they could say i've been<br>here a number of years i'm a citizen<br>it was those sex workers who couldn't<br>speak english and were<br>obviously not from this country that<br>were<br>particularly disadvantaged and they were<br>quite<br>so it highlights the unintended<br>consequences of policy it was this is<br>the only occupation that's picked out<br>that migrants can't come and work in<br>there are trafficking laws we have never<br>we've had no evidence of sex work<br>trafficking in this country<br>the only case that has come to the<br>courts for trafficking has been in the<br>horticultural industry but yet sex work<br>remains<br>there are trafficking laws there was no<br>need to put the section in<br>and we have been arguing for quite some<br>time that it should be<br>amended and removed from the<br>and this is the last one i want to study<br>it's quite a a long way i'm going to try<br>and abbreviate it because it<br>gets quite involved but the<br>impetus for this study came about<br>because of tensions between street-based<br>sex workers<br>and residents or business owners around<br>the areas that they work in so we wanted<br>an action-based sort of study to form a<br>a group to look at research results<br>and a group of people all people<br>involved<br>to look at the reset and come up with<br>options to ease the tensions<br>so it was a community engagement type of<br>research and<br>we interviewed and for this we got<br>funding from lotteries and we<br>interviewed<br>six workers we interviewed residents and<br>business owners we interviewed council<br>and outreach workers have i left anybody<br>out<br>don't think so so we interviewed all of<br>them that i aim was to bring<br>representatives from all in but all kind<br>of stakeholders into a group to<br>to discuss how we could relieve these<br>tensions<br>so this was particularly in auckland and<br>and christchurch that we've had this<br>happen<br>and i'm going to just concentrate on<br>christchurch after the earthquake you<br>know most street-based sex workers work<br>in manchester street<br>between sort of litchfield street<br>that's worked between lechville street<br>and billy ave sort of<br>but when the earthquake happened and the<br>cordons came up<br>the they couldn't work they were sort of<br>displaced from their normal place of<br>work and some of them moved<br>across believe into middle class suburb<br>in manchester street nor north of<br>biliar and this didn't this was<br>quite a shock to the residents there and<br>they they were rightfully upset i think<br>because there was a lot of<br>noise at night and in the early hours of<br>the morning<br>people were finding used needles in<br>their hedges their gardens were used as<br>toilets<br>and various other things and<br>when the residents complained to the<br>police the police would say it's<br>decriminalized we can't do anything<br>and when they complained to the council<br>the council said it's decriminalized we<br>can't do anything<br>and they got quite hit up about it and<br>eventually some of the residents<br>employed<br>a lawyer and that's when the council<br>started to think well maybe we'll<br>we'll have a bylaw and we'll just zone<br>sex work somewhere else<br>problem is somebody's got to enforce<br>that and<br>as i said before some policy just<br>doesn't work so<br>sex workers might not move so what's<br>going to happen then are they going to<br>find them<br>that means they're going to come out on<br>the street and work more in order to pay<br>the phone<br>and then they talked about well making<br>the areas so making no-go zones in<br>particular areas which also we thought<br>wouldn't work that well um so we worked<br>in the<br>in this group to try and find more um<br>acceptable solutions the<br>i think the council members on that<br>group kind of came around to<br>the way of thinking that yeah bylaws<br>weren't the way to go but the<br>councillors themselves who had to vote<br>on it were still quite fixed on a bylaw<br>and we thought that was the way it was<br>going to go and then the day before<br>the council meeting the police said well<br>if you make a by-law we're not going to<br>enforce it<br>so the council then decided well they<br>couldn't do that so they<br>allowed the community engagement to<br>carry on for another year to see if we<br>could<br>find an acceptable solution to everybody<br>and just to cut a<br>long story short we did and thanks to<br>sue's<br>sterling efforts um there we<br>within a few months had solved the<br>problem and um<br>street and street based sex workers were<br>moved back across<br>bilia it took some time took some time<br>convincing<br>sex workers that you know because they<br>got quite used to working in the suburb<br>and<br>liked it they had to kind of re-educate<br>them and tell them why it was important<br>that they moved and<br>eventually that happened so<br>yeah the the often regulation is the<br>knee-jerk reaction<br>and bylaws<br>just would have created a lot more<br>problems than<br>um and wouldn't have really solved the<br>ones that they had<br>and community engagement not regulation<br>is often the way to go and i<br>really like this quote from one of the<br>so you can come up with mutually<br>satisfactory outcomes without resorting<br>to<br>regulations it just takes time and a<br>i was i have been involved in two<br>canadian institutes of health research<br>they were purely canadian-based studies<br>so i'm not going to talk about them<br>and as david mentioned we've just been<br>funded by the<br>economic and social research council in<br>the uk<br>to do a comparative study working with<br>some of the top names in sex work<br>research<br>so professor jane schooler from<br>strathclyde in<br>glasgow professor tila sanders from<br>university of leicester in england<br>professor graham ellison from queen's<br>university in belfast<br>and professor barbara brentz from<br>university of nevada in the states so<br>we've all got different ways of<br>that in which sex work is regulated<br>so england and scotland it's partially<br>criminalized<br>ireland they criminalize the clients and<br>other third parties<br>nevada they've got legalization in<br>certain brothels outside of<br>las vegas and here obviously we're<br>we decriminalize so we're interested in<br>the issue of consent and how people see<br>consent and how that plays out<br>in terms of reporting of sexual violence<br>for sex workers<br>and how and um how it also plays out<br>through the<br>the um the legal process<br>so we are going to start that study in<br>june next year we delayed it slightly<br>because of<br>covert so i'd like to acknowledge the<br>university of<br>otago it's been a wonderful place to<br>work and been really supportive of my<br>career<br>i particularly want to thank professor<br>les tupe who was<br>my hid for many years who was<br>particularly supportive<br>especially over a time in the early<br>2000s which were quite unsettling and i<br>don't think i would have been here today<br>without his support<br>i'd like to thank the funding bodies<br>that<br>research is always difficult to get and<br>i think it's a little bit even more<br>difficult<br>to get research and funds for<br>six ba six work research but i'm really<br>grateful to these<br>funders for supporting the research but<br>the biggest thank you<br>goes to nzpc who've been<br>my wonderful partners and friends in all<br>the research that i've<br>done and i really couldn't have done any<br>of the research without them<br>all the roads that i used on my journey<br>were free downloads from the internet<br>but i've had to attribute<br>and if you are interested in reading<br>more about sex work in new zealand<br>uh the book on that side is a 2010<br>book taking the crime out of sex work<br>which gives more details about<br>how we got decriminalization in this<br>country and the research just after that<br>and the other one this on this side has<br>just come out a couple of months ago<br>i co-edited this book with lindsay<br>armstrong who's a criminologist in<br>victoria university of wellington and<br>that's more recent research that's come<br>out<br>in around sex work in new zealand<br>um both of these books are i believe<br>available<br>thank you julian for walking us through<br>the core of your research career<br>and congratulations on reaching the<br>professoriate<br>asides from jillian's strong gentle<br>general<br>intellectual contribution to research<br>both locally and internationally<br>on sex work there are two things that<br>stand out in terms of social science<br>and public health impact jillian's<br>mentioned both of these but i think they<br>bear<br>some reinforcement the first of these<br>is to do with the policy relevance of<br>her work and the second is to do with<br>the methodology that she's used<br>so that participatory approach that<br>she's taken<br>firstly to policy relevance many<br>researchers<br>would love to contribute to<br>evidence-based policy<br>many researchers fail to do so<br>through no fault of their own but often<br>to do with lack<br>of political will<br>jillian working together with the<br>prostitutes collective and a coalition<br>of others<br>has contributed to building<br>evidence-based policy<br>around sex work this work culminated in<br>the prostitution reform act<br>which most would agree with the caveats<br>that jillian mentioned<br>has actually improved the lives of sex<br>workers<br>it's no small thing another striking<br>feature of the collaboration between<br>jillian and the prostitutes collective<br>is their proactive<br>effort to conduct research and in terms<br>of evaluating the impact<br>of the prostitution reform act this work<br>helps to dispel some of the myths that<br>propagated around what would<br>follow on from that act<br>it's relatively unusual for policy to be<br>evaluated<br>it would be great if more of it would be<br>so<br>so this is quite unusual with regard to<br>method<br>methodology and jillian's already talked<br>about this she spent decades working<br>with the prostitutes collective<br>again many social scientists aspire to<br>work in participatory ways with<br>community groups<br>to in order to affect change and improve<br>outcomes for those groups<br>examples of close sustained and<br>effective collaboration<br>are relatively rare and it's a testament<br>to both jillian and the prostitutes<br>collective that they've sustained this<br>relationship<br>over time i want to finish on that note<br>and actually invite dan catherine healey<br>from the prostitutes collective to say a<br>it's an honour and a privilege to be<br>here jillian<br>and i didn't envisage 20 years on from<br>meeting you probably in a smoke<br>you know filled room<br>which we'd probably tried to clear<br>before you arrived<br>that we would be here today<br>acknowledging you i mean researchers<br>come and go and certainly sex work has<br>become<br>um a little bit popular but if i reflect<br>you know on the decades as i can now um<br>we are indeed truly honored<br>to have that longevity in terms of our<br>relationship<br>it's very easy to open the door<br>and it's very easy to close it and then<br>many many<br>many doors that we had to
