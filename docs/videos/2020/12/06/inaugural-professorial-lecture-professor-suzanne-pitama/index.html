accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>my name's paul brunson and i'm the pbc<br>for health sciences<br>at the university of otago and firstly<br>i'd like to welcome everybody here today<br>to this inaugural professor lecture for<br>suez i particularly want to welcome her<br>whanau<br>and family and for those people joining<br>us virtually in zoom and in the<br>overspill room<br>this must count as the most well<br>attended ipl i've ever<br>spoken at and and it's fantastic to feel<br>the energy<br>and the support in the room for sus<br>normally the vice chancellor would be<br>here but unfortunately she can't be here<br>today and she does send<br>her apologies and extends her very best<br>wishes to you<br>and your family today to become a<br>professor at the university of otago<br>i describe it sometimes as almost<br>impossible it's quite an arduous process<br>as you know to go through the process<br>and we've just done the professor oral<br>promotions around for this year<br>the standard is extraordinarily high to<br>become a professor<br>at this university and today is a<br>celebration of sue's achievement<br>and her introduction to her community as<br>a professor<br>and without more of a do i'll pass to<br>the dean david murdock<br>you<br>for those who don't know me my name is<br>david murdock<br>i'm the dean and head of campus here at<br>the university of otago christchurch and<br>a big big welcome from me and i was<br>going to make the same comment about<br>breaking records because i think this is<br>the most well attended ipl we've<br>probably had<br>all inaugural professorial lectures are<br>special and a source of great pride and<br>this is<br>certainly no exception it's wonderful to<br>see so many people here today and my<br>role in this is one of the<br>more pleasurable roles i have as dean<br>which is in to introduce<br>the speaker and my writing instructions<br>are to be short<br>and not to steal the thunder from the<br>speaker so i'll try and do that and i'll<br>just really hit on some high notes and<br>there are plenty of them<br>susanna's of natica nunu hails from new<br>haka<br>which if you don't know where that is<br>you probably should<br>if you know sue's about the northern<br>hawke's bay<br>and is a registered educational<br>psychologist<br>sue's trained and studied first at the<br>university of auckland<br>with a bachelor of master's degree<br>graduating in the<br>mid-1990s she went on and studied for a<br>postgraduate diploma in educational<br>psychology<br>at massey university in 1999 and shortly<br>after made the wonderful and i think<br>very sensible decision to come<br>south and moved to christchurch<br>and joined the university of otago on<br>this campus first as a lecturer<br>and what was then the department of<br>public health and general practice<br>her journey from that time has<br>really has been full of impressive<br>achievements and i thought i'd just run<br>through some of those<br>shortly afterwards and i think it was<br>about 2004 she was very<br>instrumental in the establishment of of<br>mehi<br>maori indigenous health institute which<br>of course is one of the jewels on this<br>campus<br>and she was the founding director and<br>that was director until earlier this<br>year<br>when that was that role was taken over<br>she is also our first ever associate<br>dean<br>maori in fact you're our only associate<br>dean maori and that was a role<br>that was established in 2010 has been a<br>really really critical<br>position on on this campus her career is<br>distinguished<br>by innovation learner-centeredness<br>leadership both nationally and globally<br>she has developed award-winning globally<br>relevant research and teaching expertise<br>that examines the place<br>of indigenous health within health<br>education<br>she has developed taught and promoted a<br>program that<br>that gives medical students an<br>understanding of maori<br>the influence of colonization and racism<br>and systemic factors<br>experienced by maori patients and whanau<br>the ultimate aim is to empower health<br>professionals to address health<br>inequities from within the health system<br>and<br>she already has left a huge legacy and<br>to give you a sense of scale<br>in 2001 when sues joined us<br>there were about three hours dedicated<br>to her<br>maori within the medical curriculum and<br>now we<br>have about over 60 hours in the final<br>three years alone<br>so a huge change and we are running<br>calculation we think that probably about<br>2 000 doctors have been through<br>the program and have been influenced by<br>it and we certainly get<br>amazing feedback from the sector about<br>those graduates<br>susie has too many awards and<br>distinctions to go through them all but<br>i'll just<br>point out some she won the prime<br>minister's supreme award for teaching<br>for tertiary teaching the joan mitchell<br>medal from the royal society<br>many awards from the leaders in<br>indigenous medical education the line<br>network both team and individual<br>she chairs the health research council's<br>maori health committee<br>she is a director of the australian<br>medical council<br>and is the inaugural chair of the<br>aboriginal their aboriginal<br>and torres strait islander and maori<br>standing committee and of course<br>as those who know recently she was a<br>finalist in the new zealand woman of<br>influence awards last week<br>when people talk about sues a lot of<br>words of in common<br>passionate engaging motivating<br>inspiring connectiveness with community<br>fun<br>suze is a gifted communicator and<br>teacher and creates a really<br>safe environment around her and in fact<br>i was<br>i was functioning as a head of<br>department for the promotion to<br>professor<br>and i must must say it was probably the<br>easiest one i've had to write<br>just given such obvious outstanding<br>leadership<br>and accomplishment in all categories<br>so in her lecture susa is going to<br>explore the role of medical education as<br>a vehicle for addressing maori health<br>iniquities<br>sues we're really looking forward to<br>hearing from you<br>please<br>oh<br>foreign<br>you're looking all sparkly thank you for<br>being here<br>i wanted to start today by telling you a<br>story<br>the day dawn is about to break and it's<br>early morning<br>on the 10th of september 1985<br>in new york city 10 years in the<br>planning<br>involving multiple eve ewe and two<br>governments have<br>all contributed to this very moment<br>arupu of 90 from aotearoa are clustered<br>together<br>in front of the metropolitan museum of<br>art<br>then pierces<br>the air through the early morning air<br>the crowd begins to move forward<br>heeding the call then we observe five<br>kaumatua leading the group individually<br>they begin to chant ancient karakia<br>many of them not heard for generations<br>the americans fall silent this is a new<br>phenomenon to them<br>they are spellbind by the cultural<br>exchanges<br>it is the first time that maori have led<br>an exhibition<br>of maori art and it is the first time<br>that maori art has been shown<br>internationally<br>as maori art the karakia continues<br>and the ropu descends upon the entrance<br>steps<br>and with ease they make their way<br>through the museum<br>arriving at the upper exhibition area<br>with<br>care they enter the room too tall with<br>taiaha leading the way<br>the ahi the wahi and the room is<br>overwhelming<br>tears flow freely the anticipation<br>reaches a climax<br>as the view of the room opens up and of<br>the 174<br>artifacts holding the maori of tipuna<br>marking the legacy of multiple lines of<br>whakapapa<br>they come into view legacies that have<br>been denied<br>forgotten buried due to the impacts of<br>colonization<br>legacy is now positioned with care<br>and imperfect lighting to project their<br>mana<br>their legacy now illuminated the tears<br>continue to flow<br>no words can actually truly capture this<br>moment<br>this feeling and yet the exhibition<br>the temari exhibition gained huge media<br>attention<br>both in the u.s and here in new zealand<br>this raised the profile of maori as an<br>indigenous<br>community and provided a stage which was<br>which valued for the first time the<br>talents and contribution of maori<br>this also occurred at a pivotal time in<br>new zealand history<br>when we were calling for the crown to<br>respond to the continuing negative<br>impacts of colonization<br>and the impacts that these had on the<br>determinants of hawara<br>it was a call to address the<br>discrimination in health education<br>housing and justice systems this<br>included the need<br>to protect the revitalization of te reo<br>maori<br>and tikangamari i want to highlight<br>four specific outcomes of the tamari<br>exhibition<br>this outcome is signposted by the role<br>of maori cultural values<br>practices and protocols that were put<br>into place to ensure that the manner of<br>the tonga<br>and their descendants were upheld<br>secondly te manuel te maori<br>this outcome was signposted by the<br>acknowledgement that<br>tonga possesses omodi the essence of<br>life<br>and therefore each tanga has a whakapapa<br>that intricately links to living<br>descendants<br>the third thing i learned is te manou<br>te kaiti akitanga this outcome was<br>signposted by the acknowledgement<br>that maori guardianship over this<br>project was actually key<br>in maintaining its integrity and to have<br>a process in place<br>that would continually monitor its<br>acceptability<br>to maori stakeholders and the last<br>is tamanoti maori the outcome was this<br>outcome is signposted<br>by maori having a platform to have their<br>voice culture identity<br>and intrinsic values as maori as tangata<br>fenua<br>recognized to me these four outcomes<br>represent poe power pillars<br>and they maintain the egret integrity of<br>each building<br>in farifa kairo or carved meeting houses<br>the power adorned with art recording our<br>tipuna<br>their talents and their legacy<br>i've been involved in maori health for<br>many years<br>maybe too many years and i'd like to<br>discuss with you<br>how these four outcomes as poe<br>also record our team's tikanga and<br>values<br>so this first po is named te manuel te<br>tikanga<br>you will note that the tipuna holds a<br>tuki<br>in his hand a tuki was used to carve out<br>the beautiful<br>poe in our fare for kairoa however the<br>tuki<br>also symbolizes courage and strength in<br>the times of adversity<br>in the tamari exhibition we noted that<br>appropriate cultural values<br>practices and protocols were needed to<br>within the exhibition and in health this<br>is signposted when we use kaupapa maori<br>methods<br>to ensure we maintain this a<br>strength-based focus on our mighty<br>communities<br>and include a critical lens of both the<br>crown and capitalist agendas<br>our team has been strongly influenced by<br>both historical and contemporary maori<br>influences<br>who have actively demonstrated the<br>importance of applying a decolonized<br>lens<br>to all of our mahi this has meant<br>constant reviews<br>of our research and our teaching<br>methodologies epistemologies<br>paradigms methods and android andragogy<br>to ensure they validate maori values<br>beliefs and experiences<br>and knowledges it has led us as a team<br>to use language that then reflects these<br>paradigms<br>including that actually being maori is<br>not a risk factor<br>but it's a marker of exposure to risk<br>factors<br>that the whole role of research and<br>teaching<br>is to align with maori community<br>aspirations and expectations<br>it is not to impose further burdens<br>or responsibilities on our communities<br>that we should never refer to maori as<br>being vulnerable<br>but instead we should focus on<br>critiquing the systems that create<br>and maintain vulnerabilities in our<br>communities<br>it has led us to utilize a critical<br>research theory<br>a which critiques western science<br>algorithms<br>formula assumptions and coding<br>techniques and quantitative and<br>qualitative research<br>as they are all laden with colonial bias<br>and it pushes us to articulate how our<br>methods<br>align with decolonized theory and how<br>this influences the outcomes of amahi<br>it has led us to consider how we<br>to ensure that we don't reinforce<br>colonial in a deficit focused theory<br>that we provide clear solutions to<br>address health equity<br>that our recommendations are targeted at<br>the institutions that hold<br>power and resources to achieve health<br>equity<br>and if these systems would just be bold<br>enough<br>we could actually accomplish health<br>equity<br>and lastly to present the information<br>in multiple formats so that stakeholders<br>can benefit from our mahi<br>now from this po and the lessons learned<br>from it<br>emerges our second po<br>so this second po is named te manuel te<br>maori<br>and the tamari exhibition this was<br>acknowledged<br>uh um that tonga were acknowledged to<br>possess<br>modi and therefore each has a whakapapa<br>that intrinsically links to living<br>descendants<br>and health this is signposted by clear<br>acknowledgement<br>that holomati content maori research<br>projects and<br>all of our service activities possess a<br>modi<br>they are connected to whakapapa and<br>intricately linked to us<br>as living descendants you will note here<br>that this poe<br>holds three kitty representing<br>teaching research and circuit service<br>activities<br>firstly let's talk a little bit about<br>our teaching our team has been<br>acknowledged nationally and<br>internationally<br>for our teaching when we teach<br>each scenario has a whakapapa<br>it tells a true story one of either one<br>or multiple<br>patients or whanau the very purpose<br>of the hui process in the mehana model<br>is decolonizing tools<br>our support clinicians to approach<br>patients and whanau is tonga<br>within the health system and ensure that<br>they are cr they are treated with the<br>same respect that those tonga from the<br>tamari exhibition<br>were treated with maori patients have<br>reported that our students<br>and our grown-up graduates have provided<br>them with culturally safe<br>care within the health system and this<br>actually has resulted<br>in them feeling valued more better<br>informed<br>having access to diagnostic tests and<br>treatment options<br>and more confident to make decisions<br>about their care<br>maori health stakeholders of which many<br>are here today<br>have reported or they ring us or they<br>email us or they just uh<br>or we stalk them but they've been<br>they have told us so many wonderful<br>stories<br>that demonstrate how our students and<br>our graduates<br>positively contribute to the culturally<br>safe health environment within our<br>district health boards<br>i want to ask you a question now can you<br>stand if you have ever been taught by<br>our team<br>can you stand if you have ever been<br>involved in<br>our teaching both here or in the<br>community<br>can you stand if you have ever been a<br>maori patient<br>that has let our students interview you<br>can you stand if you have been an<br>academic<br>can i say to you thank you for<br>the second kitten is that of research<br>when we research the focus of the<br>research<br>has a whakapapa it is connected to<br>the maori of patients and whanau who<br>want high water<br>and perhaps have not got it within our<br>years of research we have<br>found that maori do access care and want<br>access to best quality care<br>but we have also reported that the<br>evidence shows us that external factors<br>like poverty racism<br>and the health system have a greater<br>impact on health<br>outcomes than any internal factors<br>we have reported that lack of access to<br>quality clinical care<br>that aligns with best practice<br>guidelines is absolutely<br>unacceptable and can appropriately be<br>measured<br>and monitored to hold both us as<br>clinicians<br>and health systems to account<br>that there are areas in health where<br>mainstream research still<br>does not have the answers to how we will<br>improve our whole order<br>so it is important that we draw<br>matauranga maori<br>to assist us to push forward with maori<br>health advancement<br>can i ask you to stand if you have ever<br>worked<br>as an advisor<br>as a participant in our research as a<br>collaborator in our research<br>aurafov hit you up for advice the day<br>before the applications were due<br>can i ask you to stand if you have been<br>part of<br>the research funding organizations that<br>have helped us out can i ask you to<br>stand up if you've ever reviewed one of<br>our applications or publications<br>i wanted to say to you thank you for<br>contributing<br>the last kitty service a service service<br>activities<br>also hold their own modi because their<br>kaupapa<br>is not as because their kaupapa is all<br>about protecting<br>and advocating for order in our mighty<br>communities<br>our team does a lot of this including<br>being involved in health research<br>assessing panels<br>committees and boards medical education<br>committees of which there's many thanks<br>tim and rebecca<br>presentations at ngos and community<br>groups<br>presentations to health professional<br>organizations<br>who can amend their systems and be more<br>responsible to maori and<br>our plunket that are here today we sit<br>on national<br>working parties all those set up by the<br>ministries<br>to advocate for change with the hope of<br>providing resources or service<br>that might hopefully someday positively<br>contribute to how order<br>can i now ask you to stand if you have<br>another image thank you<br>being part of a team or community we<br>have<br>if you've ever attended a hui or<br>conference where you've been subjected<br>sorry<br>can i say to you thank you for<br>contributing to the modi of this po<br>kamahi<br>now i would like to ask you to glimpse<br>back at this po<br>because you will notice now that from<br>this uh<br>as we look towards us back from this po<br>and the lessons learnt<br>emerges our third po<br>now you will note that this third po<br>holds a fishing net the net represents<br>our responsibilities to look after those<br>was one of my ancestors from new haka<br>where all great ancestors come from<br>um whose net was said to go from<br>paranahou<br>and the hawke spray right up into the<br>east coast of whangara<br>this great regional area demonstrated<br>his ability to care<br>for not just the people but the region<br>so this<br>third po is called te mano o te<br>kaityakitanga<br>and the exhibition this outcome was<br>signposted by the acknowledgement<br>that maori guardianship over this<br>project<br>was key to maintain integrity and to<br>have a process in place that would<br>continually monitor its acceptability to<br>maori stakeholders<br>and health this is signposted by our<br>team's role<br>to maintain the integrity of our work<br>within maori communities of which we<br>belong<br>and this way the net actually represents<br>our role in social accountability and to<br>have social accountable practice<br>this enables us to maintain the<br>integrity of and the modi of the work<br>that we do<br>we do this by ensuring that maori<br>communities<br>of which of course all of you are part<br>many of you are part of<br>are part of the design development<br>implementation and monitoring<br>of all our research teaching and service<br>activities<br>that we understand and navigate our<br>roles as both<br>insiders belonging to the maori<br>community and<br>outsiders belonging to an academic<br>institution<br>within a social accountability framework<br>and that we remain<br>open to critique and feedback oh when we<br>get lots<br>from our stakeholders not as growlings<br>but as gentle suggestions that we can<br>still improve<br>and we hope that we do adjust our mahi<br>to reflect that<br>with the link strongly formed between<br>the first<br>second and third po this final po<br>and the connection between this final po<br>reflects the mahi supported by the first<br>three<br>po as it bears the outcomes of this mahi<br>you will note that this fourth poe holds<br>in her arms<br>a tamariki mokopuna denoting the impact<br>of our mahi<br>on future generations<br>the mano o te and the maori exhibition<br>was signposted by maori having a<br>platform<br>to have their voice culture identity and<br>intrinsic values as tangata fenuga<br>recognized<br>and health this is signposted<br>by it being recognized that maori have a<br>right to health equity in aotearoa<br>this means good quality ethnicity data<br>collection<br>being collected this means data sets<br>our systems that have appropriate<br>methods and tools<br>to allow us and to ensure the monitoring<br>of the crown's responsiveness to maori<br>health<br>this means including the context of<br>and analysis so that maori data<br>has its voice it has its cultural<br>identity<br>and indigenous intrinsic values<br>recognized<br>is only achieved when the right<br>processes<br>protocols are in place that nurture the<br>essence<br>of the well-being of life with the<br>leadership and management<br>which is invested in the well-being of<br>as a team we have really needed these<br>poe<br>and the strength and the connection<br>between these poe<br>has been really important for us over<br>the years<br>to assist us whether the many challenges<br>that continually<br>impact our fare these include<br>navigating societal and institutional<br>biases<br>that have been socialized by colonial<br>and racist frameworks<br>needing to critique western science<br>which continues to promote objectivity<br>as the only real science and it has not<br>been explicit about<br>how this lens maintains and promotes<br>white privilege<br>that high impact journals do not<br>prioritize indigenous health<br>nor any of the research methods that we<br>utilize in indigenous health research<br>which highly leads to publication bias<br>that international forums and teaching<br>and research<br>do not prioritize the value of<br>indigenous innovations and advancements<br>that we also as a team have a huge role<br>in providing professional development<br>for our non-maori<br>health workforce and i want to mayhe to<br>all my non-maori peers here today<br>who you would have noticed stood<br>multiple times that they openly<br>contribute to our service our teaching<br>and our research<br>we also need to maintain as a team<br>appropriate social accountability while<br>meeting maori<br>community expectations not just naito<br>ahari there's some other demands out<br>there and<br>and i acknowledge those<br>we also need to try and contribute to a<br>growing maori health<br>workforce who need more ph maori phd<br>supervisors who need more mentoring who<br>need<br>more opportunities to grow and develop<br>in an environment which nurtures them<br>for who they are as tonga<br>and you will note currently in our team<br>we're quite a small rupee and you'll<br>notice<br>that we've doled in some of the students<br>to help make up our numbers today<br>but we have an incredibly big work<br>agenda<br>1987 it was time for the tamari<br>exhibition to return<br>home the organizers regrouped<br>and decided that the exhibition would go<br>to poor nikki<br>then here to ototahi then down to<br>otiputi of which i think if john<br>broughton is watching<br>he was there so i need to do a shout out<br>and then finally up to tamaki makoto<br>the exhibition was named te maori te<br>the return home the exhibition created<br>a buzz in aotearoa that had never been<br>seen before<br>maori and non-maori flocked for the<br>first time to see maori art<br>exhibited as maori art not<br>anthropological documentation of a<br>historic people that once will grow<br>skirts i'm not depersonalized<br>not dehumanized from their whakapapa but<br>an acknowledgement of maori as<br>people the artifacts as tonga<br>and the maori of both i was very very<br>grateful<br>to be part of the ngati kahunanu<br>contingent<br>that attended te maori to hawkinghamai<br>both in wellington<br>and in auckland when i think of these<br>four po<br>i think of the po from my ewe of ngati<br>kahananu<br>who took their place with within the<br>tamari exhibition<br>and each of these po are stylized from<br>the po<br>from our area each of them was a<br>precious maori<br>each as soon as i saw them i felt<br>my challenge to us today going forward<br>is to recognize these poe<br>and their connectedness and their<br>relationship with each other<br>to acknowledge that maori to understand<br>the role<br>of processes like the maori health<br>advancement guidelines i'm not just<br>doing a shout out because i'm on the hrc<br>board<br>but to ensure that our research our<br>teaching<br>and our service has a focus on health<br>equity<br>remember the importance of being<br>socially accountable to our maori<br>communities<br>demonstrate meaningful changes that<br>result in health equity<br>as we embrace these powers of university<br>a district health board<br>and a community we will create the wehi<br>the<br>external energy necessary to activate<br>change in our health environment<br>like to maori activated change and the<br>art environment<br>it was a privilege to attend to maori<br>it has been an utmost privilege to be<br>here<br>for the last 19 years to be with the<br>mexi team and all our phenomena at uoc<br>and university of otago<br>to be present and to be part of the modi<br>of this work<br>and it is my hope for the future that i<br>will have the<br>privilege to see the outcomes that reset<br>reflect<br>or<br>whoa<br>why<br>oh<br>foreign<br>so i'm just going to close this up with<br>a karakia<br>tattoo i was going to catch my breath<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>oh<br>today<br>oh<br>oh<br>okay<br>well ladies and gentlemen that concludes<br>the formal parts of our proceedings<br>today<br>my last duty today is to invite you all<br>to join us for refreshments<br>outside the lecture theatre uh to share<br>in further conversations and fellowship<br>and thank you once again for attending<br>today<br>which as i say uh is a record ipl<br>in my opinion for a whole host of<br>reasons so thank you very much thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
