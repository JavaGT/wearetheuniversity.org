part<br>of<br>you have done it again another year<br>another<br>graduation and as always another day of<br>success<br>thank you for your continued commitment<br>to uplifting the manner of all that<br>walk through that wahara like many other<br>graduates sitting here before me you<br>opened us with open<br>you welcomed us with open arms and<br>quickly became that<br>needed whanau away from home<br>chancellor vice chancellor senior<br>leadership<br>academic teaching and support staff and<br>the many other rokura that make up the<br>courage of support<br>here at te herangawaka<br>i knew for sure i had picked the right<br>university when a fresh loaf of rewa<br>bread greeted me in a lecture theater<br>in my first week of orientation<br>words truly cannot express the gratitude<br>and respect we as students<br>have for each and every one of you we<br>are the product<br>of your time and energy and really do<br>appreciate<br>all the many email reminders face to<br>face corridor<br>modera everybody my name is pounamute<br>chambers<br>it is a privilege and honour to be<br>standing before you<br>as your graduate speaker for this<br>graduation celebration<br>today i graduate with a bachelor of arts<br>majoring in pacific studies and maori<br>resource management<br>i started here at tehengawaka in 2017<br>and the past four years have been a trip<br>of a lifetime<br>an incredible journey of highs and lows<br>savage storms<br>and profound calms frustration<br>determination<br>for overall growth i technically<br>finished studying last year<br>and the smooth sailing i was told about<br>post-uni life<br>has not eventuated with the coronavirus<br>shaking our entire global society i want<br>to acknowledge<br>all the loss and her endured across the<br>world<br>i salute each and every one of us for<br>dealing with the frustration and<br>confusion that came with such an<br>unfamiliar<br>experience the world is ever changing<br>and adapting to these new realities is<br>one of the many storms we'll sail<br>through<br>in life when thinking of where i am<br>today<br>and what my university journey has meant<br>to me i can only make sense of it<br>in a world i know best that is the world<br>of waka<br>as well as the many doors this<br>university opened up for me<br>i'm privileged and proud to say i am a<br>homeowner on board te matowa maui<br>wakahodua<br>or crewmember on board the double-hulled<br>sailing canoe of ngatikahunganu<br>the life on board teaches you so much<br>about teamwork<br>commitment reading the signs of your<br>environment but most importantly<br>how you really are the captain of your<br>own canoe<br>i see life as a great expansive ocean<br>and we are like waka channeling through<br>that water<br>with the many storms that surround us<br>we can sail on through and are<br>eventually blessed by tamanui terra<br>coming to university is like chaining<br>your waka in the lagoon<br>getting the lessons the tools and the<br>overall experience<br>needed to head out into the deep blue<br>moana<br>the two hulls of o wakahodua can be<br>interpreted<br>in many different ways they can<br>represent the two worlds of tau maori<br>or the western way of life the balance<br>between friends and family<br>and your life back home found versus<br>your new found realities<br>either way a waka cannot truly operate<br>without the balance and it all comes<br>down to the skills<br>and foundations we allow ourselves to<br>use<br>i couldn't be more grateful for the many<br>stored provisions i'm blessed with<br>from the love and support of my<br>beautiful whanau my friends both back<br>home and sitting here in front of me<br>and all the many interactions i have had<br>and pro in preparation<br>for today's celebration the kaupapa or<br>deck of the waka<br>is a space where everyone is able to<br>come together<br>it's the platforms the mixing and<br>mingling and the opportunity in life<br>every person is given kotahitanga is<br>vital to the collective success of tewi<br>maori<br>and the needed space to communicate<br>sorry<br>and the communication needed to work<br>together would not happen without these<br>spaces<br>for me there were many different wahi<br>that acted as my kaupapa here at<br>tehengawaka<br>but the fatiha was definitely a platform<br>i could not have got through university<br>without<br>from the many amazing feasts i was able<br>to enjoy<br>to the stories in whakapapa shared over<br>a good cup of tea<br>to everyone i was able to share space<br>with<br>now to the function of the sails these<br>represent your preparedness for the many<br>influential wins that come and go in<br>each of our lives<br>these ones are the people the places the<br>lessons<br>and all the adventures that come from<br>each direction<br>your sales are powered by what you<br>surround yourself with<br>and however they are set can take you to<br>amazingly different places<br>like the randomest midnight missions to<br>oriental parade<br>last but definitely not least the<br>steering paddle<br>or hoy is what determines your direction<br>i came to university to gain a restingly<br>wicked a westernly recognized tohu<br>to bring an indigenous voice and story<br>to the table<br>i stayed because of my continued passion<br>to positively represent<br>my whanau maihapuri and tiwi maori<br>and now it's about steering our waka<br>into what looks like very exciting<br>and intriguing waters any waka is<br>capable of getting onto the lagoon it's<br>making it out to te moana nui that waka<br>were really made for<br>we need to trust in the process and have<br>faith in the matodanga of our tipuna<br>society teaches us that only the smart<br>and rich can make it to university<br>but if there is one thing i want you to<br>take away from this corridor it's that<br>everyone is capable and in control of<br>their own waka<br>and not even a low grade at university<br>celebration<br>maybe you need some time on land to<br>mentally prepare yourselves for the<br>challenges and adventures that will take<br>place once you have left<br>or maybe just spending time with your<br>whanau is all you need<br>to fill your provision provisionary<br>keter for the voyage<br>ahead we are all smart and rich in our<br>own ways<br>and the university is only one of the<br>many destinations<br>that life's journey will take us on<br>remember where you come from<br>and where you want to go but be prepared<br>for waves to roll up<br>along the way we all tied our waka to<br>the hitch post of this marae<br>and it is now time to untie that hidey<br>so pull in your toda and grab hold of<br>your hoi<br>hika no tato ido<br>we are all capable we are all strong and<br>we have all been given the needed tools<br>foreign<br>my<br>oh<br>oh<br>foreign<br>oh<br>oh<br>oh<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
