graduates<br>to all of your friends and family to the<br>chancellor<br>to the vice chancellor and all of the<br>academic staff that have helped all of<br>us in our journey to this night tonight<br>tonight is a time for us to reflect on<br>where we started the years of hard work<br>that we've all put in to get here<br>and on where we are now standing as<br>alumni of tahiti<br>victoria university of wellington i'm<br>sure like most of you i was not sure we<br>would even get to this day<br>2020 has been a year of surprises and a<br>year of expectations that have taken<br>unexpected turns<br>this year has brought adversity and<br>challenges like that our generation<br>and previous generations beforehand have<br>not seen in many a lifetime<br>however i believe that tehengawaka has<br>provided us a platform to face their<br>adversity<br>and confront these challenges head on we<br>will confront them with a sense of<br>purpose and vigor derived from our time<br>learnings and experiences in our journey<br>at victoria university<br>victoria university of wellington is a<br>diverse community<br>a unique assemblance of people from<br>different backgrounds different<br>upbringings and different journeys<br>who have come together for the shared<br>purpose of attaining their respective<br>goals<br>we are lucky to study in our university<br>and in a city that embraces this<br>diversity with open arms<br>our university experience has challenged<br>us to broaden our thinking<br>to look at each situation with an<br>analytical eye to think critically and<br>ask the hard questions<br>and to continuously acknowledge all<br>perspectives with the wide vision we go<br>into the world with new tools in our<br>kitte<br>ready to embrace the world head on and<br>all the opportunities that come with it<br>throughout my time so far at victoria i<br>have met so many wonderful and unique<br>individuals<br>through programs such as afina through<br>pacifica mentoring programs<br>through tutoring through victoria<br>international or simply getting involved<br>in the cultural weeks that staff and<br>students organize<br>the opportunity to connect to and<br>embrace my own heritage as well as<br>learning about that of others<br>has given me the chance to widen my view<br>of the world and appreciate everyone for<br>both our differences<br>and our similarities being at university<br>gives us a unique opportunity to build<br>meaningful relationships with each other<br>to become a part of different<br>communities and to participate in an<br>environment where we can receive and<br>share our collected knowledge<br>to help each other succeed i feel so<br>lucky to have created and built on so<br>many new relationships in my time at<br>victoria<br>and these are relationships that i'm<br>sure will last a lifetime<br>whether it be meeting through a campus<br>coach tour on the very first day of<br>university<br>continuing friendships that started<br>during high school<br>or considering in the paint of weekly<br>six-hour labs the people you share your<br>university journey with are truly what<br>make the journey so<br>special and i can say that at least for<br>myself i've<br>been surrounded by a bunch of fun and<br>brilliant minds who helped each other<br>enjoy the grinds of exam season and<br>equally helped in the subsequent<br>celebrations after finally finishing<br>they say the people that you meet during<br>university stay with you for a lifetime<br>and i believe that to definitely be the<br>case<br>as graduates from the faculty of science<br>we are paving the way to making a<br>difference to our generation<br>and hopefully the generations beyond i<br>know it may sound cliche<br>but amongst those of you sitting in this<br>room tonight could be people who could<br>change the world<br>i think that the majority of us here<br>chose to do science not because it's<br>easy<br>but for the challenge and for the<br>opportunity to be able to make a<br>difference<br>when i started my degree in biomedical<br>science i had no idea where i would end<br>up<br>i simply knew i enjoyed biology and had<br>always imagined that i would end up in<br>an area that was important to me<br>where i knew that in some shape or form<br>i could make a difference to someone<br>else's life<br>four years later i have ventured on to<br>undertaking a masters in biomedical<br>science in the field of cancer research<br>victoria has allowed me to continue to<br>strive for success in an area that means<br>a lot to myself<br>and to my family as the newest<br>generation of scientists<br>we are part of the solution and part of<br>the future<br>in this room could be someone who helps<br>perfect the covert vaccine<br>could be the person who helps in our<br>plight to fight against climate change<br>or the person who synthesizes the next<br>anti-cancer drug<br>in this room we have the next generation<br>of physicists of computer scientists<br>and of marine biologists everyone in<br>this room has put in the hours and<br>potentially tears<br>to get to where we are tonight i know it<br>has taken a while to get here<br>but i hope that everyone in this room is<br>immensely proud of where they are<br>sitting tonight<br>it is no mean feat completing any degree<br>let alone a science degree<br>and we go forward with the skills and<br>attributes that could literally change<br>the world<br>i want to leave you with a short proverb<br>the bird that eats the thread belongs to<br>the forest the bird that feeds on<br>knowledge<br>owns the world through university we<br>have obtained the knowledge and the<br>expertise to succeed in our respective<br>fields<br>it is up to us to feed on that knowledge<br>now to go out into the world embracing<br>all the opportunities that we have<br>and that we can create and use our time<br>at victoria as a stepping stone to get<br>there<br>i challenge everyone in this room to<br>dream big to believe that you can own<br>the world with your knowledge<br>whilst remembering everyone who helped<br>you get there when asking my peers what<br>advice they would give to their younger<br>selves leaving university they said<br>simply<br>be kind be compassionate and work hard<br>to achieve<br>your goals not those of others then the<br>world will be your oyster</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
