evening on behalf of this<br>year's graduates<br>this setting slightly more intimidating<br>but i am very grateful to be delivering<br>the speech to you in person<br>this ceremony acknowledges the hard work<br>and commitment of tonight's graduates<br>however we could not have reached this<br>achievement on our own<br>thank you to all in attendance tonight<br>each of you have had a role to play<br>in helping me and my fellow students<br>walk across the stage tonight<br>parents guardians family<br>and my own biggest supporters mum and<br>dad<br>thank you for the care packages your<br>unwavering encouragement<br>assistance and love one of the first<br>things university taught me was how<br>little attention i had paid to the<br>intricacies of daily living for my first<br>18 years<br>so thank you for fielding the array of<br>to friends i know for a fact that i<br>wouldn't<br>be where i am tonight without the social<br>circles i have developed<br>and i imagine this ring is true for all<br>graduates<br>the value of being able to call on you<br>when needed is immediate<br>the sunday morning flat discussions<br>about who did what the night prior<br>all the heated debates about the<br>important things in life<br>like where the eggs need to be kept on<br>or out of the fridge<br>are some of the things i loved most<br>about being constantly surrounded<br>with like-minded students so thank you<br>to the school of business and government<br>your knowledge<br>and passion has been enthralling the<br>diversity across the staff<br>made for a true melting pot of stories<br>and experiences<br>that brought a wealth of viewpoints to<br>light<br>to have access to such a high caliber of<br>professors and lecturers<br>in this little corner of the world is<br>something i'm truly grateful for<br>i'd like to make a special thank you to<br>the small team of staff from the tourism<br>management department<br>to have the ability to speak with you<br>one-on-one so frequently<br>have doors open for me and my career<br>while also working under you as a tutor<br>for three years<br>is something i have greatly appreciated<br>i can attribute a lot of my drive and<br>passion<br>to contribute to the industry to you<br>and now it's my fellow graduates just as<br>when we arrived at university<br>and were faced with the task of starting<br>to become adults<br>now as we leave and take on the<br>workplace this task is magnified tenfold<br>what a year it has been we are now<br>walking into a world<br>drastically different from the one we<br>had at the beginning of our journey<br>through university life<br>however if this year has taught me<br>anything it is to be more grateful<br>and while the pandemic has brought about<br>huge tragedies to the world<br>i am grateful to have a bit of new<br>material to cover in this year's<br>graduation speech<br>the amount of times i've heard the word<br>normal recently has grown dramatically<br>so many people saying they can't wait<br>for things to go back to normal<br>in june when i finished my final exam<br>said farewell to flatmates<br>and staff i couldn't help but look at<br>the situation with a little despair<br>the borders were closed plans flouted<br>industries come crumbling and me sitting<br>there with a tourism management degree<br>while the most distance anyone was<br>allowed to travel<br>that moment in june was meant to be one<br>of excitement<br>and celebration and instead as i imagine<br>it were<br>for many graduates was replaced with<br>apprehension and concern<br>to go back to the old normal then would<br>have been great<br>since that time my viewpoint has changed<br>considerably<br>while the current situation is far from<br>ideal<br>the old normal wasn't without its<br>troubles too<br>i now see this as a bit of a reset<br>button<br>much like an earthquake has the ability<br>to flatten a city<br>the virus has had a vast effect on all<br>facets of life<br>however when the dust settles cities are<br>rebuilt<br>new ways of thinking are needed and the<br>people's action these plans<br>are given freedom to create a better way<br>of living<br>the canvas not entirely blank but the<br>opportunities that we now have as<br>graduates<br>with thanks to those surrounding us this<br>finally one of my favorite books<br>is titled every time i find the meaning<br>of life<br>they change it while it may currently<br>seem as though the rug has been pulled<br>from underneath us<br>just as plans have been made challenges<br>will continue to be thrown at us<br>throughout our lives and we will have to<br>adapt<br>a continual search for improvement<br>while some things i could do without<br>normalizing<br>like flatmates taking zoom calls at the<br>dining room table in a box a short<br>slash certain thai ensemble<br>with the title of that book in mind and<br>the acknowledgement<br>that the world is an ever-changing<br>environment<br>my challenge to you is to take the<br>skills you have learnt here<br>take the social networks you have built<br>and go create<br>a new better normal i look forward to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
