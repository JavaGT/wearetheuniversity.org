very best for the future<br>i particularly want to acknowledge my<br>friend and colleague from bankside<br>chambers simon<br>foote who has just graduated with a<br>doctor of philosophy degree<br>this is not an advertisement but he's a<br>very fine lawyer<br>a great colleague and i didn't know that<br>he was so studious<br>can i also acknowledge my former youth<br>mp<br>sam hart sam and his family are very<br>dear friends of mine<br>his mother deb is moving his<br>admission to the bar on friday and<br>he is as nervous as i am that she's<br>going to fluff her lines<br>there are other people present whose<br>names i think i recognize i see a<br>tremaine out there i think i know you<br>congratulations on your achievement<br>my favorite story about honoree<br>doctorates<br>concerns the late robert muldoon<br>he was given an honorary doctorate i<br>don't know by what university many years<br>ago and he was asked in the house by<br>mike<br>moore whether he intended to use the<br>title<br>doctor part-time as in dr<br>the answer i understand was volcanic<br>but the correct answer is that someone<br>who receives an<br>honorary doctorate is not entitled to<br>use the name<br>doctor but it is received with great<br>pleasure<br>and with grateful thanks to the<br>university<br>i endorse everything that the chancellor<br>said<br>about how lucky we all are<br>to have been graduates of victoria<br>university<br>the governor general hates it when i say<br>this but she was my torts tutor<br>jeffrey palmer former prime minister<br>terrorised me in legal system and the<br>law of torts<br>and ken keith who was finally a judge<br>of our supreme court and a judge of the<br>international court of justice<br>taught me administrative law and<br>international law<br>and it was such a great pleasure and<br>honor to<br>appear before him in the hague<br>when we took the japanese to the<br>international court of justice<br>over whaling in the southern oceans<br>but the particular person and the<br>faculty i want to acknowledge is<br>professor tony angelo<br>tony angelo was my first teacher<br>he gave me 7 out of 30 for my first<br>terms test and legal system<br>and he wrote over my paper confused<br>well eat that tony because i was<br>attorney general for nine years<br>but<br>but he was an outstanding servant of the<br>faculty<br>for half a century he was dean of the<br>law faculty during a very tough time for<br>the faculty<br>when a report was written by it that<br>broke all the rules of natural justice<br>and he had to pick up the pieces and do<br>a great job he did<br>he's worked extensively throughout the<br>pacific<br>and in mauritius designing the laws of<br>mauritius<br>and for that reason he was made a<br>queen's council<br>by me in 2016 and was<br>given the honor of the order of the new<br>zealand<br>order of merit he's an outstanding<br>individual<br>and he typifies the commitment and the<br>excellence<br>of the law faculty when i<br>studied constitutional law with<br>professor<br>quentin baxter i have to say that we<br>never once<br>studied the treaty of waitangi it never<br>rated a mansion and yet most of the work<br>that i did in my public life<br>concerned the treaty of waitangi and<br>breaches<br>of it and it very much was the education<br>of a public man to be the<br>minister for treaty of waitangi<br>negotiations<br>and try and address some of the wrongs<br>that have occurred<br>in our nation's history and i<br>particularly<br>think for example of takings under the<br>public works act<br>because i can tell you this if ever<br>there was land to be taken for a road<br>and the choice was between taking<br>general land<br>or maori land guess what land was taken<br>inevitably i was honored to stand at<br>parihaka and apologize<br>for the atrocious events that occurred<br>there<br>i was so lucky to be the minister when<br>we apologize<br>to the great naituhoy and i acknowledge<br>professor rawinia higgins here today<br>so many wrongs will have been<br>perpetrated<br>throughout history against those<br>wonderful people<br>most recently with the horrendous police<br>raid in ruatoki some 10<br>12 years ago they have been treated so<br>unfairly<br>and to reach a settlement with them and<br>to apologize<br>for what happened was one of the great<br>highlights of my career<br>i acknowledge damn fran wilde who's here<br>today she<br>is among other things the chair of te<br>papa<br>she was my treaty negotiator<br>on many occasions and i always remember<br>the time fran phoned me<br>and said look the eewee i think it was<br>ngati pajawera<br>want some land and doc says it's<br>pristine land<br>but there's only one problem with it<br>it's covered in gorse and it's got goats<br>on it it's old lands and survey land and<br>i said well i'll pay a visit<br>remarkably by the time i visited<br>the goats had been shot and the course<br>had been cleared<br>and that was ten days so this is the<br>sort of thing<br>that ewe have had to confront year in<br>and year out<br>treaty settlement negotiations were<br>never easy<br>and in accepting uh the honorary<br>doctorate it's<br>so important for me to say i accept it<br>not only for myself<br>but for the many many people who have<br>worked so very hard<br>in treaty negotiations over the years to<br>secure justice for their people<br>so as you practice law and i'm obviously<br>not referring to the engineering<br>graduates<br>i do hope uh that the lawyers here today<br>will recognize<br>the opportunities that there are that<br>what you<br>may think you've you may think that you<br>have<br>learned it all but i can tell you your<br>education and the law<br>is only just beginning so thank you very<br>much for the tremendous honor<br>that i have been accorded today<br>i very much appreciate the opportunity<br>that i had to be the minister of treaty<br>negotiations<br>and i'm very heartened that in recent<br>times the dominion post and other<br>newspapers<br>have decided to apologize for their<br>coverage<br>of treaty matters over the years as well<br>they should<br>when i was negotiating with ngati tua<br>over the great haka composed by<br>tarapraha<br>and secured an agreement over that with<br>ngati tua the headline in the dominion<br>post was<br>all blacks harker goes to maori so<br>they've got a long<br>way to go a lot to apologize for there<br>are other things i could suggest they<br>apologize for<br>but my political career is over so<br>what's done is done<br>chancellor vice chancellor members of<br>victoria university<br>you lead a great university and i'm<br>honoured and privileged to be here today<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
