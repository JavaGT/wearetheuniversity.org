new<br>zealand's oldest university<br>which is ranked in the top one percent<br>in the world<br>but before we introduce our guests would<br>like to show you all<br>a very cool video on why students chose<br>otago<br>and why you should ignore those urban<br>myths<br>people said otago is too far away but i<br>said<br>i want to go further with my study<br>people said the median is<br>too cold i said no it's actually pretty<br>cool<br>people said dunedin is too small but i<br>said you become a big part of the city<br>and make a big impact people ask how can<br>i make friends here<br>and i said how many people ask why did i<br>choose our taco<br>and i said you just have to come and see<br>that video really does set up the theme<br>for today's talk show<br>and we have three out of the five stars<br>from that video with us today<br>i'd like to remind you that we have if<br>you have any questions<br>please use the facebook chat or zoom<br>chat<br>and send them through as we've got staff<br>answering these questions<br>for you okay so in the meantime i would<br>like to introduce you to the fabulous<br>alyssa guang and jun<br>so starting with you alyssa a little bit<br>of an introduction<br>hi i'm alyssa and i'm from the<br>philippines<br>and i'm currently studying software<br>engineering<br>in the lovely university of otago<br>fantastic<br>my name is quang i'm from vietnam i'm<br>currently studying international<br>business<br>and i'm almost in my final years<br>fantastic<br>and last but not least june hi i'm june<br>i'm also from vietnam<br>and i just finished my first year doing<br>a double major in marketing and<br>management<br>and i'm also picking up a minor in<br>writing next year<br>fantastic welcome everyone and thank you<br>so much for participating<br>in this show um i'm going to ask you all<br>first of all why did you choose<br>otago so let's start with you june<br>um so i did high school in queenstown<br>which is you know in the south island<br>and i just feel like i really make<br>queenstown my home<br>which is why i chose dunedin because<br>it's only a three hour drive away from<br>queenstown<br>and um i just like the way that the<br>people in the south island are really<br>friendly lovely people<br>and dunedin campus was set out really<br>well<br>to make the student life a lot more<br>interesting and i<br>i'm really glad that i chose to come to<br>i came to otago because it was difficult<br>so<br>i used to study in wellington and the<br>atmosphere there enables me to choose<br>more easier options like victoria<br>university i mean<br>it's literally in the city so i was<br>thinking<br>but dunadine is a foreign place it has a<br>strong student culture which is unique<br>from the working culture i'm accustomed<br>to<br>and otago is also schoon i have never<br>heard of<br>before until now so i decided to come<br>over there to<br>overcome some of the challenges and i<br>find myself really lacking here<br>fantastic and alyssa well<br>i come from the philippines in a<br>little tiny town and then<br>i went here to new zealand and then<br>i decided that you know what i want to<br>go to uni<br>in a big city that's the first thought<br>that i had so i was researching oakland<br>university well like you know victoria<br>university<br>but for me like the student life did not<br>appeal to me as much as it did in otago<br>i think what really interested me in<br>coming to otago is what<br>like the student life how the people how<br>friendly the people<br>are and like how the pretty the campus<br>is and how close<br>everything is together as well as the<br>city i think what<br>people say that dunedin's such a student<br>city you know because<br>everywhere you look you can see a<br>student and i think that's really<br>attracted me to come to otago and i was<br>like okay i started otago then<br>nice that's great all three of you now<br>it is quite unusual that we have nobody<br>who's been in auckland first of all<br>but i am going to ask june this because<br>queenstown is not normally<br>a choice that we have our students who<br>go directly to<br>normally it would be auckland being the<br>biggest city so um<br>queenstown to dunedin has been a little<br>bit of a shift<br>and but has it lived up to expectations<br>um so i came from ho chi minh city<br>vietnam which is<br>biggest city in vietnam pretty much and<br>at the beginning going to queenstown was<br>a little bit intimidating considering<br>how<br>quiet and a bit countryside it is<br>but i found out that i really enjoy a<br>more quiet calm life<br>and um yeah it's been lovely so far<br>moving to dunedin it's queenstown's a<br>bit like a<br>small city and dune is a bit like a big<br>town<br>the vibes are pretty much very similar<br>and yeah it's been a great change<br>fantastic okay so got a bit of a<br>background about you know<br>now we also know that you have very<br>recently received your university<br>results this year<br>and i've seen some smiles so this is<br>good and we did hear that you've all<br>done pretty well<br>so um i was going to start with june but<br>i just finished with june so i'm going<br>to go to alyssa and start this one off<br>and how about some tips and sharing<br>amongst the review of<br>what and you would see to get some good<br>results<br>yeah um you know balancing student life<br>and academic life and otago is quite<br>hard<br>especially if you like you know going<br>out<br>but i feel like if you for me if you set<br>out your priorities straight if you're<br>like okay i want to go grades<br>i want to have a good mark and you're<br>like okay you just actually<br>sit down and study but for me the<br>greatest tip that i would recommend is<br>actually<br>talking to the people around you<br>especially the ones in your lectures in<br>your tutorials<br>you're just like hey you want to you<br>know study together and stuff<br>because i think what i learned here is<br>that everybody is on the same boat as<br>you everybody's struggling<br>the same thing as you're struggling with<br>so might as well talk to people<br>beside you go form a study group<br>and just study together and i think what<br>if you don't want to talk to your<br>people around you might as well talk to<br>someone older than you<br>like the people that are above your year<br>because<br>i think what i learned the most is that<br>they give amazing tips they're like<br>pointing to the right direction of what<br>to study<br>or with your exam so i'm like so<br>grateful<br>that people are so friendly because you<br>can ask so many questions to them<br>awesome i i totally get you like um when<br>i first came balancing uh<br>study life and um just having fun in<br>general it's very difficult because it's<br>just so appealing there's so much to do<br>but um<br>yeah i found a solution to that and it's<br>probably<br>one of the best studying tips that i can<br>get people as well<br>make your education into an<br>entertainment itself um<br>otago university encourages<br>creativity and originality in your work<br>so let's say you're studying<br>a commerce paper it's not just about<br>studying what's in the book it's also<br>your opinion<br>with arguments with supporting points<br>from this book as well<br>so i find it very fun to you know<br>add some originality into my work and<br>that makes it really fun<br>and that really helps balancing between<br>the entertainment life and also the<br>academic life<br>just have fun sweet um<br>i agree with the point of you know<br>having a community of students around<br>you that can help but also the support<br>from the university itself is also<br>really helpful to me<br>so i just finished my first year and for<br>all of the<br>most of the first year's paper otago<br>university offers past<br>sessions just peer assisted study<br>sessions<br>and basically you just have um a student<br>from<br>a year to above you and they in a study<br>study group<br>and people just exchange tips and<br>pointers on how to do exams how to<br>finish assignments and<br>yeah it's really helpful and i would<br>recommend doing that in your first year<br>of study if you can<br>yeah just to add up on that it's just<br>not that but tutorials<br>in mandatory paper are extremely good<br>like uh<br>if you just attend them you probably get<br>the gifts of what's going on<br>and i just i just attend tutorials and<br>of course with lectures and i find it<br>really helpful for my results like<br>there's a visible difference<br>with papers i participate in tutorials<br>and paper i do not<br>and certainly pass that help as well<br>yeah<br>i was just going to add up to that<br>because i did pass<br>for my law course my little paper and i<br>just found it extremely helpful<br>it's because it's a just a community<br>where you just share ideas<br>balance ideas between people with your<br>fellow students with your fellow<br>classmates and it's not intimidating<br>because you only have like what like 10<br>people in one word<br>and then you have a person as your<br>teacher<br>that's like a year above than you so<br>it's just so helpful because<br>they give you amazing tips on your<br>course<br>so how did you find out about past when<br>you first go here<br>um actually every lecturer mentioned it<br>in<br>every single one of my paper in in the<br>first one yeah like it's on the slides<br>it's on the<br>blackboard classroom itself everywhere<br>so there's no escaping<br>i'd love to talk to you about the<br>flexibility in otago degree<br>now you change from a bachelor of law<br>to software engineering tell us a little<br>bit about that<br>so when i first got to uni i was a bit<br>unsure on<br>what i wanted to do you know for my<br>degree<br>and what i really think is the most<br>amazing thing about otago is that you<br>have the flexibility to choose your<br>courses<br>so i chose bachelor of laws i also did a<br>commerce paper<br>a commerce course and then i also did<br>software engineering course<br>and i think that's what really set up to<br>me and was like<br>okay this is what i want i want to do<br>software engineering after this year<br>i think that's what's really amazing<br>about it is because here in otago you<br>have the luxury to choose whatever paper<br>you have<br>compared to other universities like from<br>different countries because i know<br>in the philippines when you say oh i'm<br>doing law<br>like you're just doing law you can't go<br>to other fields you can't go to other<br>courses you're just set in stone with<br>law<br>but for in dunedin and otago you<br>it's not like that you have the chance<br>to choose whatever<br>paper you have interest at and see where<br>you<br>you know where you're good at i guess<br>so yeah um we're really lucky to have<br>that<br>so yeah yeah no i have to agree with the<br>flexibility because<br>um so i finished my first year in a<br>bachelor of commerce<br>but i was really interested in the minor<br>of writing and<br>literally i just got a click hey i want<br>to do write writing and<br>i've got writing in my degree now yeah<br>it's really<br>simple to just choose what you want to<br>do i actually remove my miners<br>so adding and removing the flexibility<br>tells a bit about that<br>just just about that so um these two<br>guests here i have talked about<br>how wonderful the flexibility in choices<br>however i must emphasize on the<br>flexibility<br>in time and cost so<br>to finish my degree if i had to keep my<br>minus then it would have extend for<br>another<br>one or two years and i didn't want that<br>so<br>time for me is quite pressed i went to<br>the course coordinator<br>and she just you know work it out remove<br>my miner transfer some of my credits<br>the flexibility ingrained in the system<br>itself enables me to have one time less<br>for my degree<br>so if anyone is having problem with<br>money or<br>wants to graduate sooners you have that<br>options you always have that options<br>and i was going to emphasize on like if<br>you want<br>to choose to you know go to a different<br>path<br>you need to realize that your credits<br>aren't<br>gonna just disappear you aren't wasting<br>time<br>because your credits are still gonna go<br>towards your degree<br>so you're not wasting time let's say i<br>go from bachelor of laws to<br>software engineering i'm good because<br>i didn't waste a whole year of doing<br>bachelor of laws<br>because my bachelor of laws credits got<br>transferred to my software engineering<br>course so yeah quite lucky that we're<br>able to do that i guess<br>i'm so so glad too that with the<br>flexibility of an otago degree<br>you guys sound like you're finding your<br>passion yeah and when you come to<br>university<br>your first year you're directed by<br>parents maybe<br>friends you're not quite sure it's not<br>high school right<br>so being allowed that first year to<br>find your fee see if this is what you<br>want to do change if you don't take off<br>those miners and carry on doing that in<br>your second<br>maybe not more your third year you<br>really kind of not got to get to know<br>what you want to do<br>i think it's really really great yeah<br>yeah you get to be a first year actually<br>in both mind and body yeah not just<br>someone who was playing out<br>all his life within the first day yeah<br>very cool<br>so i'm going to ask you so you're<br>studying a masters of international<br>business<br>and you gave a little bit of insight<br>that you've been doing some work with<br>some overseas students so we'd love to<br>hear a bit more about that<br>oh yeah so i'm doing a level two<br>management paper<br>it was about international management<br>concerning you know i'm an international<br>student<br>so um i went to this paper expecting<br>only to read books and answer questions<br>but apparently it's the exact opposite<br>it relies heavily on practical skills<br>and i was surprised by that so to get<br>credits you need to enroll in multiple<br>programs that enables you and forces you<br>to use<br>the theory you have learned in class to<br>a practical setting<br>and of course to keep up with the trend<br>this was a project<br>at the end of the year that's called gee<br>which is<br>a virtual team project and<br>i have to work with people from nigeria<br>switzerland<br>china philippines and it says such a<br>rich diversity<br>and it makes me face obstacles that are<br>relevant to<br>you know real life like how to manage<br>time zone<br>like a technical these in um virtual<br>settings<br>and it just trains me to work<br>in a environment where my career will<br>benefit from<br>and i didn't expect that from just a<br>level two paper<br>and i'm waiting to get my do my level<br>three paper which<br>has even more opportunities to put my<br>skill to a test fantastic i wonder how<br>fantastic hey look when we're promoting<br>the university<br>one of the messages we're also always so<br>proud to tell everyone is the fantastic<br>student support that this university<br>provides<br>so i'm going to ask each of these<br>wonderful students<br>to tell us what type of service that<br>they've been used to<br>what have you found really super helpful<br>um to to to go towards your studies or<br>help your studies<br>so i think i'll start with lisa<br>um for me it's a big help joining groups<br>um for me there was this um computing<br>for girls<br>called comp girls otago and<br>because my degree is just full of guys<br>i'm not gonna lie<br>and um i am a bit intimidated just to<br>talk and just speak up<br>and then i found this amazing group and<br>there were just<br>a group of girls doing code and doing<br>the same thing as i am and i was so<br>shocked i was like oh my god you guys<br>exist<br>and it's just helped me so much<br>through this paper because they've<br>actually helped me<br>speak up when i was so shy of speaking<br>up because i was in a room full of guys<br>they just gave me this boost of<br>confidence they helped me through my<br>paper they helped me<br>you know do this study this this is what<br>you're wrong at and it's just such an<br>amazing<br>guide to your degree i guess and<br>also further commenting about past<br>that's such an amazing<br>student support and also ask otago<br>i don't know if you can include that but<br>you can totally<br>include ask a toggle because at first i<br>was so unsure about<br>you know if i can do this or my papers<br>like changing my course<br>i was just unsure about everything and i<br>think oscar otago just helped me so much<br>and they reply really quickly<br>so yeah so to give a bit of an<br>explanation about ascatago they are a<br>fantastic service<br>that is situated in our central hub and<br>in our<br>our library and they're there from 8 in<br>the morning to 11 at night i think yeah<br>and you literally go and ask a toggle so<br>any question you have<br>they can if they don't know the answer<br>they will find the answer for you<br>and if any of you are emailing the<br>university at<br>m university at otago.ec dot nz it's the<br>ask the toggle team that will be able to<br>help you out too so<br>yeah awesome um quan<br>smooth uh yeah yeah definitely so as<br>otago is certainly one of the<br>servers i use the best but the one i<br>remember the most is<br>they they include so many things that<br>are great<br>for physical fitness in unipol you got<br>spots<br>you got people who are doing weight<br>lifting and you got<br>hardcore cardio goers and you got<br>classes for<br>every single thing that exists<br>kickboxing<br>yoga and all everyone there is just so<br>helpful like<br>you you drop into the gym and you are<br>new to it you feel kind of<br>strange but people can just help you out<br>they come to you and ask<br>you okay you need some help and that<br>kind of communities really enables<br>a long-term interest in physical fitness<br>and<br>having a good body in university is<br>quite<br>important considering you know the kind<br>of workload we have<br>yes i have to agree on unipoll the<br>facility there is<br>great and the staff are always really<br>helpful and it's really<br>cool that it's free for all students to<br>join as long as you have a student id<br>card and um also it's pretty close to<br>where most students live in dunedin it's<br>like a 15-minute walk pretty much<br>and it's just a nice walk along the<br>campus and you know you can work out and<br>feel good about yourself and on the note<br>of physical health<br>i would like to mention student health<br>which is the<br>medical assistance system that we have<br>here at otago<br>university it's really helpful for<br>international students who<br>don't really have like a family doctor<br>in new zealand<br>and they have the insurance system which<br>helps you you know like if you have any<br>concerns about your health<br>it's very affordable to contact student<br>health and they will sort you out with<br>pretty much any concerns that you have<br>fantastic so a real mix and that's just<br>some of the um many many services that<br>we have but it's great to see that<br>you're really taking advantage of them<br>and enjoying using them as well<br>and it's fantastic so<br>i think a few questions are coming in<br>seriously oh we have<br>questions okay so thank you for sending<br>some through<br>and so i'm going to read from the ipad<br>and okay we have got somebody<br>from facebook zo from facebook what were<br>some of the difficulties you faced as a<br>southeast asian<br>student studying in a new zealand<br>university<br>that's interesting yeah yeah well i can<br>think of a few<br>on top of my head just right now without<br>you guys<br>it's gonna get deep it's gonna go<br>really yeah right um so the first thing<br>i encountered was<br>uh cooking yeah yeah it's a very<br>everyday life so um as a southeast asian<br>students uh<br>most of the cuisines we have specialized<br>in spices<br>and to recreate those some of those<br>spices over here is<br>really difficult and if you can't get<br>the taste<br>and every single dinner you will miss<br>home<br>and i find it really helpful to just eat<br>the food<br>that my local friends make so i can get<br>used to a new zealand cuisine especially<br>fish and chips<br>yeah so that's one of the problems i<br>encounter which is just<br>food it's small things but<br>adds up every day it becomes a big<br>problem yeah yeah<br>and the um local asian supermarkets that<br>we've got because we've got the new one<br>on the corner actually yeah<br>yeah yeah is that are you able to access<br>more not not with spices<br>foods yeah exactly but spices oh yeah<br>yeah you miss that a lot<br>oh that's the problem if they're fresh<br>you're not gonna be able to<br>to bring them in okay so at least we've<br>got some supermarkets all right<br>can cater to the package stuff maybe not<br>the spices<br>all right um for me one of the<br>difficulties i faced like the first year<br>that i was here which was when i was in<br>high school<br>um was just the confidence i just had<br>like self-esteem of speaking english<br>talking to kiwis<br>locals i was just so shy<br>like i just didn't want to talk to<br>anybody i just<br>stayed with my circle i guess<br>i just didn't want to talk to anybody i<br>was shy i was like nope i'm not going to<br>talk to you<br>you're an english speaker no and<br>i think that was what hindered like<br>my opportunities i guess when i was in<br>high school but then<br>the more open you get the more time<br>you're<br>here the more you realize that oh these<br>are people<br>they're like me you know they're just<br>speaking a different language<br>then you're going to realize that oh<br>we're all the same<br>so might as well i'm going to talk to<br>you i guess<br>and then when you the more you talk i<br>guess to people<br>the more confident you get with your<br>english the more you're like oh this is<br>a piece of cake<br>i can write in english i can speak in<br>english i can do whatever i want in<br>english<br>so yeah and then that's when your<br>confidence just gets boosted i guess<br>cool yeah um i so i came<br>to new zealand in the middle of summer<br>of vietnam but it is winter in new<br>zealand and<br>i was really intimidated by how<br>supposedly cold<br>it was going to be but it's it's<br>genuinely it's not that bad<br>it's not that cold you think that it is<br>but it is<br>a nice dry way of just coolness<br>and you know as long as you know how to<br>dress for it it's actually really nice<br>to not be sweating all the time<br>coming from the south asian country yeah<br>okay awesome so we've got another one<br>from facebook<br>uh jasmine how hard were the sources for<br>the<br>um come here students how hard were the<br>business<br>i would say not hard i don't think it is<br>hard<br>they are very interrelated<br>so as long as you pay attention in class<br>you can apply accounting in finance you<br>can apply stats<br>and business in society you can yeah<br>there's a lot of<br>interconnectedness between them and<br>they are designed for people who has<br>never<br>done any of the sorts of business paper<br>before in high school<br>to do i didn't do accounting i didn't do<br>economics and i went to high school in<br>new zealand i didn't do any of them but<br>the papers were just very comprehensive<br>and they're meant<br>to teach you from the beginning you<br>should not be intimidated by it because<br>they're designed to help you out yeah um<br>if you aren't intimidated by a sample<br>food in supermarket you shouldn't be<br>intimidated by this first-year paper<br>that's called paper because at the end<br>of the day is to guide you on your<br>interest if you take it and you like it<br>it is amazing right there like each<br>paper i designed like a<br>small sample size of each laser so you<br>can just go ahead<br>and choose you know have have fun with<br>it yeah because um my major is marketing<br>and management but i was<br>this close to sway to economics just<br>because of how cool that core paper<br>in economics was i don't know i've heard<br>economics being described as cool before<br>so that's good you can like a lot of<br>graphs<br>love it the student lifestyle<br>in dunedin really sets the university of<br>otago apart from any<br>other university in new zealand there's<br>no other city in new zealand where<br>twenty thousand students live on and<br>around the campus<br>within about one and a half kilometers<br>so i want to first of ask about<br>accommodation<br>how was your experience june living in a<br>residential college<br>now at otago we call them residential<br>colleges overseas they call them<br>halls halls of residence accommodation<br>halls dormitories<br>so yeah what was your experience living<br>at a residential college<br>yes um so i lived in arana which is a<br>college five minutes away from the otago<br>campus and<br>actually our i think 13<br>colleges most of them are within a 10<br>minute walk to the campus<br>so it's just a great way to encourage<br>you to show up to class<br>to go to the library to study to attend<br>your tutorial<br>just because of how close it is to just<br>get up and go<br>and also it's a really nice way to have<br>a peace of mind that you don't have to<br>worry about<br>paying bills cooking food keeping<br>yourself warm<br>in the first year that you're trying to<br>transition into a new way of<br>education you can just focus on your<br>studying and<br>making friends and building a life that<br>you will enjoy<br>in donating nice<br>so we've all got different backgrounds<br>alyssa you started at home<br>and then you moved into a uni flat now<br>i'm just going to explain a little bit<br>about uniflats<br>they are um so about a couple hundred of<br>them<br>and they tend to be townhouses or<br>sometimes individual bungalows they're<br>all different<br>and students have their own bedroom they<br>share a kitchen<br>they share a bathroom some have gardens<br>and all different shapes and sizes<br>and you are specifically put with<br>students<br>that are similar in background to you<br>and normally with shared interests<br>so how was your unified experience i<br>would say it was<br>the most amazing experience i've ever<br>had in my entire life<br>um that was quite lucky that i got into<br>uni flats<br>actually because there was this only<br>spot left they were like okay you have<br>this only spot left go i was like okay<br>okay okay i'm gonna go<br>and i was it's just the most amazing<br>experience i think it's because<br>first year like i made the mistake of<br>not going to a hall<br>because for me it was quite hard making<br>friends when i was in<br>in a hall and i was just going home to<br>his home next to his home so it was<br>not the greatest experience then i went<br>to uni flats after a few months<br>and then i realized that oh my god this<br>is the most amazing experience<br>one it's because you're living in a<br>house<br>full of amazing people that are from<br>different parts of the world<br>they're from asia they're from america<br>canada i don't know<br>sometimes they're from like i don't know<br>the rarest country you would ever<br>find and you're like okay where is that<br>but um<br>it's just such an amazing community<br>because we have so many events<br>as well that we just gather around and<br>you meet this amazing<br>huge chunk of people that are just<br>literally<br>from all over the world and what i also<br>like about that is<br>it's a mixture of kiwis and<br>international students<br>because you'll have a kiwi host which is<br>a person that lives in your flat as well<br>but<br>is going as a kiwi and he he or she is<br>going to guide you through<br>the places that you should go the<br>activities that you should do<br>and they're more of a guide to you but<br>they live in the same house as you if<br>that makes sense and<br>i just love how everything just connects<br>together<br>it's a good transition from meeting<br>kiwis<br>and meeting international people as well<br>but i think the saddest thing is just<br>saying goodbye to them<br>every six months or maybe sometimes a<br>year<br>but i wouldn't trade it for a while it's<br>the most amazing thing i have to ask you<br>about cooking<br>because in uni flats you do have to cook<br>yeah we do have to cook yeah<br>but that's i think that's really a good<br>thing because you get to<br>cook with each people that are from<br>different parts of the world you don't<br>know what they're cooking and you're<br>like oh can i try<br>and then there you go that's a piece of<br>asia for you that's a piece of western<br>food for you<br>and it's just such an amazing thing<br>because<br>you eat different cultures i guess<br>yeah like if that makes sense because<br>you just eat people's comfort food<br>and you're like oh this is so good and<br>then you learn<br>recipes from them so you're like okay<br>that<br>if they're gone i'm i can make this and<br>it's just such an easy thing to do<br>and yeah i was really blessed to have<br>that experience and i want to try it for<br>the world<br>cool so kong again quite a different<br>background you came from homestay in<br>wellington<br>and you went into private flaring so how<br>about some tips or tricks of how to find<br>a flat<br>tips and tricks in finding a flat uh so<br>there are many flattening groups on<br>facebook<br>and a lot of them are tiger flattening<br>goods and just flattening in general<br>and on trey me as well there are many<br>places that you can hide<br>so the best way is to check out all of<br>those options<br>and preferably at an earlier time<br>important semester<br>probably two months earlier<br>than the actual you know enrollment date<br>then you might be able to find a flat<br>but if you really want<br>good flats you really have to plan ahead<br>like half a year ahead<br>so it's certainly a difficult spike but<br>if you want a really thrilling challenge<br>and if you want a really strong<br>friendship coming out of such rough<br>situations<br>then flattening is certainly the way to<br>go and so much more freedom<br>yeah cool so you're both going into<br>and june unless they're going into<br>flatting this year yeah yeah<br>um yes actually so with residential<br>holes<br>um you you need to move out by the<br>end of your last exam yep so for this<br>year um i<br>started flatting actually a month ago<br>because that was where my last exam was<br>and i just joined a random flat from a<br>facebook group and it was actually<br>amazing i did not expect to meet<br>such cool people who just take me to the<br>beach<br>up the mountains go hiking all the time<br>like i think it's it's a thrilling<br>experience as<br>quaint said and there are many many good<br>players around dunedin that<br>we always need a couple more people to<br>fill the room<br>yeah this town has twenty thousand<br>students you do not end up living<br>with students regardless and students<br>are really creative with their<br>activities so<br>if you just went in it's best to<br>socialize with people living there<br>because uh<br>isolating you in your room is there's so<br>much opportunity loss<br>just not socializing with those students<br>very cool it comes on now you're allowed<br>to work<br>20 hours a week while you're studying<br>part-time and then<br>full-time during the holidays june you<br>have a part-time job<br>how's that finding study and balance yes<br>so i do have a retail job that i work<br>part-time<br>during the school year and i'm currently<br>working full-time during summer<br>and um i would say with the workload so<br>far<br>i've experienced balancing working and<br>studying can be a bit tricky but if you<br>know how to it's not it's not difficult<br>so um my ships are on the weekends and<br>basically you can get all of your work<br>done during<br>the week you know you go to lectures and<br>tutorials in the morning<br>do your homework in the evening and you<br>should be all good to go<br>would you suggest getting a part-time<br>job in your first semester when you<br>first arrived no<br>i would not you suggest that at all um<br>the reason why i have a part-time job<br>this entire year was because i did it in<br>high school but i would not recommend<br>your first semester in a new place<br>having a part-time job<br>it can be a bit stressful and especially<br>you should not<br>tipped you should not have a part-time<br>job on<br>both days of the weekend it does put a<br>toll on your shoulder<br>shows your life a little a little bit<br>yeah<br>so i would recommend if you were to have<br>a part-time job maybe<br>do it during the afternoon and evening<br>of<br>some weekdays and then you can have the<br>weekends to yourself to relax<br>to go out do some sports enjoy<br>student life yeah nice so a bit about<br>socialising nice segue because we talked<br>about sport and<br>now what we get asked a lot about when<br>we're overseas<br>is um food we've obviously touched on<br>spices<br>and and can you eat out cheaply in the<br>city<br>and so what restaurants or cheap eat<br>tips would you give future students<br>um for me it's just the local fish and<br>chip shops<br>like it's okay when you say fish and<br>chips like the thing that you think of<br>is like you know dirty<br>like you know fish with a lot of barns<br>but that's not like that in new zealand<br>you get like two dollars fish and chips<br>and<br>that would set you up for the whole day<br>like all day let me tell you<br>or if you don't like fish you can go<br>with chicken and let me tell you that's<br>going to set up for like maybe the whole<br>week<br>because you're going to have leftovers<br>and it's<br>there are some so many like amazing<br>shops here in dunedin because<br>like we're just so close to the city<br>and i think what that's really the<br>greatest thing is because<br>since we're so close to the city like<br>people get so creative and they just<br>have um they make up ideas that just<br>would relate to students as well like<br>bubble tea<br>or just vegan food vegetarian food which<br>is<br>quite popular nowadays and they're quite<br>cheap i'm not gonna lie especially if<br>you're a student so<br>yeah quite lucky that we have that in<br>the octagon<br>oh i'm an expert of this you've been<br>flatting<br>oh definitely definitely so i would<br>categorize them in three seconds the<br>first one<br>is a price ring from robbing from two<br>dollars to five dollars<br>um you got that so the best place you're<br>going to get<br>those kind of food is probably in mega<br>hako<br>yes yes uh and a similar characteristics<br>as all this place share is that<br>those five dollar meals they're gonna be<br>in form of either sushi or rice ball<br>that's that's just gonna that's just<br>what you're gonna get<br>or fish and chips but of course she has<br>covered that<br>um the second price range is around<br>roughly to eight to<br>twelve dollars then you got so many so<br>many places in the city to choose you<br>got<br>chopstick um you got golden island you<br>got<br>noodle stalls you see you get so much<br>and<br>the third price range is probably the<br>most fancy<br>that's what julie you find those kind of<br>shop um this restaurant in bars<br>and in brewery and of course those are<br>also valuable in octagon as well<br>but i do not recommend those because the<br>experience you get out of a five dollar<br>sushi box in a windy day outside the<br>city it's just so memorable<br>i can't believe any of you haven't<br>spoken about the international um<br>food festival oh yeah<br>yeah definitely last year oh yeah yeah<br>last year<br>yeah we were you guys involved in that<br>yeah<br>yeah it was great yeah this is a<br>one-time opportunity<br>true um yeah<br>um my friend and i this year made like a<br>goal to try every single restaurant on<br>george street<br>so far we have we have not we do try to<br>um yeah i don't really know what to add<br>because<br>these two has covered pretty much<br>everything that's amazing about dunedin<br>restaurants<br>although i do want to mention that<br>there's the food court in the meridian<br>mall and<br>yeah it's just if you don't really know<br>what you want go<br>go to the food court see all the options<br>there<br>there's a lot and you can just you know<br>pick and choose from them if you don't<br>feel like planning ahead<br>fantastic thank you so we've covered<br>food<br>there's a lot of options and i've<br>learned two to five dollar options so i<br>know who to talk to<br>after this and but here are so many<br>other things that you can get involved<br>in in dunedin<br>so in the student city we've talked<br>about your nepal<br>but what other things have you tried our<br>experience that you<br>let's start with guang in the middle<br>right um<br>so with flat things you got so many<br>cultures<br>jump up together and uh the best thing i<br>like to do and they like to do as well<br>is to share<br>cultures or hobbies with each other so<br>i have no concept of doing barbecue<br>after all it was just not a thing but i<br>certainly got invited to many barbecues<br>and i quite like<br>the new zealand style barbecue it's just<br>very simple<br>plain bread on cooked stuff and of<br>course i share my culture with them as<br>well i share them my childhood so we got<br>this little toy called beyblades<br>and four grown men<br>would just stay buying toys<br>20 bucks each and play beyblades with<br>each other it's quite an experience<br>a spinny thing yeah like<br>fight each other yeah explain it to the<br>generation x here<br>yeah and uh there's so much more but<br>certainly<br>exchanging cultures norm is quite great<br>very cool how about you alyssa um well<br>definitely experience a lot this year i<br>think<br>one of the things i've experienced is<br>partying a lot<br>i don't think that's appropriate but you<br>know<br>um like otago is quite famous for a lot<br>of parties and stuff<br>and at first it was a bit shy going into<br>you know that kind of you know area<br>but then the more people you meet the<br>more they're gonna drag you in there and<br>have<br>and you'll have the most amazing time of<br>your life but<br>apart from that um you know having<br>international friends because of uni<br>flats<br>um they've certainly made me try a lot<br>of things that they've experienced in<br>their home countries and i've never<br>like ex for example skiing like we don't<br>have snow in the philippines<br>so they dragged me to do skiing in<br>queenstown<br>and oh my god i would say it was<br>memorable<br>like you do need to have a lot of<br>flexibility to do skiing<br>but like it was definitely worth all of<br>it<br>and yeah i think road trips as well that<br>i've never experienced a road trip<br>because that's quite scary in the<br>philippines if you do that with your<br>friends<br>but like it was just amazing just a<br>big road trip into the south island with<br>all of your mates it's just an amazing<br>experience great yeah yes i have to jump<br>on the road trip one<br>um so i literally just got back from a<br>road trip around the south<br>island queenstown dunedin to maroon and<br>dunedin queenstown<br>um and yeah road trips are great because<br>the roads in new zealand<br>just allow you to drive so smoothly<br>whereas<br>traffic in vietnam just would not allow<br>that at all<br>and also in terms of what i've done in<br>dunedin i wouldn't have done otherwise<br>i would say um the ousa clubs<br>are a great place to start they i would<br>say they pretty much have<br>something for everyone and they do have<br>like international countries club as<br>well i<br>yeah so you can join that if you'll be<br>able to find one for yourself<br>um and also i'm into<br>theater and photography and arts so<br>pretty much just<br>jump on facebook scroll around a bit and<br>you would pretty much find something<br>that you<br>would find interesting um i'm currently<br>doing photography<br>for a theater production and it just<br>allowed me to meet so many new people<br>that share my same interest and it's<br>been really fun so far awesome and<br>that's the beauty i think of a smaller<br>city<br>is it's it's connected it's easy to meet<br>new people<br>and share different experiences because<br>you're not stuck in traffic for an<br>hour hour and a half everything's<br>walkable it's<br>a really really good easy way of getting<br>around i think yeah one thing we hear is<br>that students in other cities are<br>commuting they<br>live out in the suburbs they commute in<br>for lectures<br>maybe a little bit of library and then<br>they have to head back<br>out into the suburbs while here i think<br>as you've been explaining<br>everyone sort of just living and<br>breathing and enjoying and socializing<br>and studying together<br>so yeah you're like one big family yeah<br>okay we've had some more questions<br>coming through so thank you so much<br>i have got somebody from facebook do<br>students have to complete any<br>internships in their last year<br>now i'm not you guys aren't you last in<br>your last year you're too new<br>internships no it this is quite a round<br>question because depending on which<br>program you do some will have<br>internships some won't have internships<br>so<br>um if you've got a specific question on<br>a course please pop it in the facebook<br>chat and joyce will be able to help you<br>out in an answer there<br>okay so i've got another one from ingrid<br>from facebook she's asking<br>when it comes to finances i'm sure you<br>guys are all down with your finances<br>and was it difficult to budget for daily<br>expenses<br>and are they accidentally expenses which<br>may be quite heavy for new international<br>students um i will answer on the<br>international student part first<br>so just to apply for visa law and you<br>the government requires you to have 15<br>000<br>new zealand dollars which cover basic<br>living expenses for yourself<br>and if let's just say that you don't put<br>it in a bank with<br>massive interest rate then pay<br>set another account and pay your entire<br>rent<br>on the first day you come to new zealand<br>yeah just do<br>so and the rest of the money will be<br>available for your budgeting<br>you will have to consider on average how<br>much you eat per week<br>for me it's 75 k dollars which is quite<br>heavy<br>and a newly electricity bill and<br>also internet bill internet bill is<br>fixed but electrical bills<br>it varies per season but normally<br>there's a street pattern so<br>it's really up to you but uh otherwise<br>do leave at least a thousand dollars for<br>you know basic stuff like going up<br>restaurants hanging out with friends<br>clothes<br>whatever whatever is good for you yeah<br>um he covered not everything so<br>um to be honest it's<br>living here it's no it's not cheap as<br>you would people would say but it's<br>definitely cheaper than oakland cheaper<br>than big cities<br>and i think that's like such a huge<br>bonus for us<br>but um you know weekly expenses<br>i don't think it's going to be a lot<br>like<br>like for me personally i don't go over<br>200<br>a week just for weekly expenses because<br>i eat at home sometimes i eat out but<br>it's still going to cover<br>like under those 200 and you know<br>socializing with friends<br>it's still going to come under 200 um<br>for accommodation i wouldn't go like<br>personally from my<br>uni flats it's 240 a week<br>so but everything is included internet<br>is included water is included so<br>like i don't really have to worry about<br>that but for next year it's so<br>it's relatively going to be cheaper it's<br>only going to be 115 a week<br>so yeah it's definitely achievable i<br>um yes um i would say in terms of<br>paying for your tuition as an<br>international student if you went to<br>high school in new zealand otago has a<br>great<br>um university entrance scholarship<br>which means that if you got excellent<br>endorsement in<br>level two and level three or just<br>level two you get scholarship and that<br>really really helps with your tuition<br>you can also apply for academic<br>excellence or<br>leadership of tomorrow so otago<br>university<br>offers a lot of scholarships to pretty<br>much<br>everyone who has you know a goal that<br>they want to achieve<br>and i i would say if you're studying in<br>new zealand right now definitely take a<br>look into that<br>because it would really help your<br>finances in your first year<br>i want you to tell the audience<br>one thing you wished you knew before<br>coming to study at otago and i'll start<br>with<br>one one thing that i wish i knew before<br>i came to the school<br>is probably that everyone respect your<br>voices<br>uh so just feel free to ask feel free to<br>speak out and just<br>do whatever you know make friends<br>everyone is new everyone comes from high<br>school<br>so your first year is always always<br>going to be the biggest<br>opportunity to just form a community<br>for me i think the number one thing i<br>wish i could have done<br>is go to a hole i think that's the<br>number one thing that i would just<br>recommend to all the year 13s out there<br>all the future students that are just<br>coming and coming to you know<br>first year because i think it would<br>definitely set you up for<br>like the entire of your degree because<br>you would meet so many<br>people and it's just so easy to make<br>friends but<br>if not that i would say don't be afraid<br>to talk to people<br>i know i was intimidated at first i just<br>was so<br>shy i was so scared of not making<br>friends<br>but then i realized how easy it was<br>literally like if you<br>just approach someone like just talk<br>about your course talk about you know<br>what you're actually doing or you know<br>just like a simple hey hello how are you<br>going<br>and it'll just be like a foundation<br>of everything you'll meet so many<br>friends if you just have the courage to<br>speak up<br>and just to talk and as a person beside<br>you in your lectures tutorials what<br>they're doing after<br>you know lectures and that would be<br>such a helpful thing because you'll meet<br>so many amazing people<br>you have such an amazing year and you're<br>doing your paper<br>because you have so many help from other<br>students as well<br>and you have friends so yeah don't be<br>afraid to speak up<br>and talk to people because they'll hear<br>they'll just be around you and they're<br>they're in the same boat as you so yeah<br>great great advice um in terms of one<br>thing i wish i knew before i come to<br>otago would be that don't have<br>keep an open mind and don't have an<br>expectation of what your year<br>is supposed to be i would say there is<br>probably a stereotypical type of what<br>the first year is supposed to be<br>that you know people might pass around<br>intimate myths all that but<br>um that would be a major pressure on<br>yourself if you think that you have to<br>live<br>your life a certain way that would be<br>appealing<br>i would say that at otago there's always<br>something for<br>everyone you just gotta go look for it<br>and be authentic to yourself<br>don't try to make<br>um your year the ideal year that it's<br>supposed to be<br>because you will enjoy yourself a lot<br>more if you just<br>yeah be honest great advice from all of<br>you and<br>it's like ask a toggle ask<br>just love it and so we've we've talked<br>about some<br>tips for future students and if you've<br>got any more time is there any other<br>questions that<br>you know if somebody was to ask you<br>something that you would<br>like to pass on or what would you think<br>for your second year coming up<br>for the two out of first year you're a<br>little bit more confident now<br>a lot more confident by the signs of it<br>and what are you looking forward to most<br>in your second year<br>um i think the workload i think it's<br>like<br>because when i was in my first year it<br>was a bit easy going it was more<br>you know lectures and not a lot of doing<br>but i think what i'm looking forward to<br>like next year is just a lot of<br>doing and less of like listening to<br>lectures and stuff<br>it's really going to be more hands-on<br>into stuff so<br>i'm quite excited about that but yeah<br>there's definitely going to be a lot of<br>pressure<br>but yeah quite excited yeah for my<br>second year i would say<br>um now that i spent my first year trying<br>to figure out<br>you know what what type of studying and<br>what type of people i want to be around<br>with<br>i would just enjoy my second year i've<br>set up all the clubs i want to join i<br>set up what studying<br>i want to do and now that i can actually<br>just enjoy it<br>fantastic and going into your final year<br>yeah<br>my third year um so i'm expecting to<br>start preparing for my future career<br>um i i already got directions<br>since the startups this year and i'm<br>looking forward to start preparing<br>finish my degree and<br>step out see what's there for me<br>fantastic<br>okay we're coming to the end of our talk<br>show<br>so i really want to thank alyssa guan<br>june for participating you've all
