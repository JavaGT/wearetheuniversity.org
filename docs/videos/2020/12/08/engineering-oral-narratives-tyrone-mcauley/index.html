My mother is three-quarters Samoan, <br>she grew up in Apia. And my grandfather is from Savaiʻi. <br>I decided to study engineering because <br>well there were courses in computer science, physics,<br>things that were very deterministic but games were a creative expression <br>of that so I learnt all the raw skills I needed <br>which are surprisingly quite important when building <br>video games. Games are fun, and when I learnt that games were an <br>expression of both mathematical and scientific <br>capabilities, I was hooked. And then learning subjects like computer graphics<br>and things like that just bought <br>all the things I loved dearly into a creative space. <br>You know Pasifika people are known as quite musically talented and creative <br>and there are a number of people in film and media, <br>not so much in my space, but really it’s just another form of creative expression.<br>And the pathway to that is learning about engineering. <br>Engineering is the tool which allows you to express interactive creativity.<br>I’m a huge rugby supporter, and of course I love making games.<br>For many years I always wanted to make a rugby game <br>and about 15 years ago I got that opportunity. I ended up making <br>both rugby and rugby league games for 10-12 years. <br>I got to meet many All Blacks. I got to do motion capture at Weta Studios. <br>I got to meet Jonah Lomu, I got to tackle Jonah Lomu. You know, I never<br>imagined in my wildest dreams that this would be a part of my career <br>and that was great. There are a lot of great Pasifika sports people <br>that I’ve got to meet over the years because of my love of engineering and <br>and turning that into my passion for games. <br>I was always fascinated by interactive <br>interactive entertainment, and I badgered my parents when I was like eleven<br>years old to buy an Atari 600XL. Which you could <br>programme on, and I taught myself to programme at around 11 years old. And then was <br>hooked ever since. <br>I mean there are serious applications <br>of games now that help people with various <br>ailments, mental conditions, they get them active in ways they<br>didn’t think they could, and they help them train their brains.<br>There are gamification of various aspects of learning<br>that have come out as well. So games and game theories <br>can be applied in many different contexts.<br>You know, University is what you make of it. And the big lightbulb for me came <br>very early on even before I came to university. When you <br>understand how you can apply mathematics, science, <br>computer science and make beautiful, creative expressions that are <br>interesting and fun to play with, and how all these things feed in together.<br>It gave everything purpose. And you come to university <br>and you learn so many skills that allow you to do<br>wonderful, beautiful things. Engineering is amazing. And computer science<br>in particular for me, it’s such a creative outlet. <br>You can ask a computer to do anything you want,<br>you can imagine in your mind. Your only limit is really your imagination. <br>And engineering is the tool which allows you to express that. </p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
