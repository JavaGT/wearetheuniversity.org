in the future and<br>and reconciliation is a gorgeous word<br>and when corrymeela was founded in 1965<br>somebody has corrymeela the community<br>there of reconciliation that I'm part of<br>from that I laid for for five years and<br>was is named after the land on which the<br>house is built every piece of land has a<br>name in Ireland and the name is Cory<br>meal and somebody said Oh what means<br>Hill of Harmony that's an absolute life<br>they made it up that doesn't mean he'll<br>harm me at all it means lumpy crossing<br>place so which is much more appropriate<br>and reconciliation is painful<br>reconciliation is demanding<br>reconciliation is not a moment that you<br>arrive at and then it's done we perhaps<br>will be better off talking about a true<br>thing and reconciling processes it just<br>and that isn't even brilliant but it at<br>least implies that there's some kind of<br>conjugation of a verb that needs to<br>happen in this context that we need to<br>see there's ongoing maybe we should say<br>this decades process where this decades<br>moment of turning to this as a country<br>and then next decades and next decades<br>and to say the pain in this country the<br>dispossession the seizing of land<br>pretending that it was there to be<br>seized without treaty and down now in<br>so-called peace time without reparation<br>that needs as long as it took to get<br>here for us to get away from it decades<br>centuries<br>imagine what will be like if there was a<br>global process of true thing and<br>reconciling to the female population of<br>the world millennia many millennia<br>hundreds of millennia of recognizing it<br>has taken us this long to get here and<br>I've heard some people going we're<br>amazing we have had the woman's about<br>for 100 years<br>men is the answer so looking to the past<br>is a complicated thing and looking to<br>the past and thinking about forgiveness<br>and reconciliation is a complicated<br>thing and these rewards that shouldn't<br>be used easily we should always have a<br>multiplicity of what we were considering<br>to be more adoptions in response to pain<br>and in response to trauma always the<br>forgiveness might be a good one<br>yeah justice it's always good one treaty<br>reparation time fury art never seeing<br>your face again for the rest of my life<br>but also learning how to forget about<br>you on a pretty regular basis hopefully<br>four years at a time that's also a damn<br>fine outcome of violations rather than<br>the way sometimes the way we speak about<br>reconciliation as if it's got one shape<br>and the shape is absolutely lovely for<br>people who like things to be absolutely<br>lovely that isn't the case similarly<br>when it comes to countries it's<br>complicated to look about forgiveness is<br>difficult sometimes like in the case of<br>Ireland when we want to look to our past<br>we look to our past as people of them as<br>victims and we have suffered a lot as a<br>country in Ireland and absolutely but I<br>have a at the twin point that poem<br>earlier on I read about my granddad and<br>the famine upon this poem is called<br>Phytophthora infestans which is the<br>Latin word for and the potato blight and<br>this is a pen tool for the one person in<br>the room who I see nodding eagerly<br>whenever I mentioned something to do<br>with poetic form I'm delighted to meet<br>you will be I'm making a beeline for you<br>later on and so this is a Malaysian form<br>eight lines that are repeated in<br>different formulations throughout a<br>sixteen line poem and this point really<br>is trying to annoy myself and offend<br>myself<br>and other Irish people who are very<br>aware as we are of British influence in<br>Ireland but deliciously unaware of how<br>when Irish people went often immediately<br>after having been dispossessed to land<br>to places like America Canada Jamaica<br>Montserrat New Zealand Australia and<br>elsewhere that people Irish people Irish<br>speaking people learning English usually<br>were regularly and dispossessing people<br>after they'd just been dispossessed<br>sohere's upon Phytophthora infestans and<br>if you're offended good because I am<br>we love to blame the British for our<br>past but our past is blighted by a story<br>we won't own God knows it wasn't that<br>our suffering was mild at home but when<br>we traveled we shacked up with Empire<br>and smited other places while crying<br>about our home not with a lot of other<br>people's making but with a lot of our<br>own and not because of how an Empire<br>shackled us but because of something<br>rotten in us certainly a rout of other<br>people's making not our own starved us<br>from our villages and homes but because<br>of something rotten in us and not a<br>blight that was exploited we went and<br>starved other people from their villages<br>and their homes our suffering was far<br>from mild at home but far from home we<br>uncovered something white within us we<br>cannot blame the British for the stories<br>it's a complicated thing to talk about<br>sometimes and I'm very it's very<br>important to say sometimes people who<br>have been in situations of having great<br>pain inflicted upon their country or<br>their identity or their people and also<br>have to look at to the pain of the past<br>for themselves as part of a process of<br>reconciliation and I say that because<br>it's I think it's relevant for Irish<br>people to look at that one because<br>that's a true and important and validate<br>the Magnificent book how the Irish<br>became white by Ignacio vis a disturbing<br>and brilliant to read for anybody who's<br>interested in following that up um but I<br>I know that sometimes the idea of saying<br>well we've all got things we need to be<br>forgiven for can actually be profoundly<br>insulting to people who were coming to<br>go well actually though our people<br>didn't murder your people our people<br>didn't steal your people's land we're<br>speaking your language and our language<br>is dead you know all those kinds of<br>things you find in so many places so I<br>don't think that anybody who's in a<br>position of power through their own<br>history and privilege and narrative can<br>ever diagnose what you need to be<br>thinking about your forgiveness issues<br>to if forgiveness issues are needed to<br>be thought about well then I think<br>people from within the narrative need to<br>reflect on it rather than somebody who's<br>coming from an inheritance of power<br>being the one to diagnosis that's a<br>warning because we can use forgiveness<br>as a burden and as something the very<br>opposite of anything virtuous there's a<br>an important story a few important<br>stories that repeat themselves in Irish<br>history about and female leaders meeting<br>female leaders groan year well and I<br>pirate queen from the West of Ireland<br>groan you was her name and her if she<br>wanted to be a pirate like her father<br>and she and he said to her you won't be<br>able to be a part because your hair is<br>too long and I'll get caught in the<br>ropes and so she cut it off and whale is<br>Irish football so she's called growing<br>your whale meaning ball ball ball grace<br>is what some people call her but granny<br>away listen<br>her name or how she's known and she had<br>M remarkable fortitude<br>she had a prophecy given to her by a<br>local druid at one point and said to her<br>one of your sons who nay whose name is<br>going to be something like Ian or I<br>can't remember what the name was going<br>to be but one of your sons will can't<br>will kill your worst enemy so she had<br>seven sons and she named them all the<br>same name just to make sure that nothing<br>could go wrong one of her sons was<br>captured by Elizabeth the first and she<br>sailed across to England to meet<br>Elizabeth the first chrony Wales spoke<br>Irish and Latin Elizabeth the first two<br>spoke English French and Latin so these<br>two extraordinary women spoken laughed<br>more to each other it said that when<br>granny where walked into the room she<br>sneezed and one of the ladies-in-waiting<br>gave her a silk handkerchief or a dainty<br>handkerchief and she blew her nose very<br>loudly into it and cast it into the open<br>of fire that was in the chain that was<br>in the place I'd love to see somebody<br>make a film of it it's in Latin it's<br>simply not that I speak no laughing I<br>just think with magnificent to hear a<br>language of power being spoken in such a<br>way needless to say the Sun wasn't<br>released they their granny was son had<br>been captured or somebody blow belong in<br>Chicago and he would have been captured<br>by Elizabeth first and they said they do<br>it but they didn't and then in 2011 and<br>Elizabeth the first came to visit<br>Ireland Elizabeth the second came to<br>visit Ireland and it was a remarkable<br>visit the return was the first visit of<br>a monarch to the Republic of Ireland and<br>when she arrived he went first of all to<br>the Garden of Remembrance about her head<br>while that beautiful poem was read in<br>both Irish and English and Mary McAleese<br>was the president of the time two<br>powerful women meeting each other<br>speaking each other's languages because<br>later on that night elizabeth ii stood<br>up to make a speech at a royal banquet<br>being given and i was watching it on<br>television and as she was standing up I<br>thought what languages she don't speak<br>and of course if she was in France of<br>course elizabeth ii would speak say a<br>greeting in French if not the whole<br>thing in French I think she speaks<br>French well but if she was in any<br>country you would expect at least<br>formalities to begin in that language<br>but for Irish people to hear our<br>language being spoken back to us by a<br>person who not is not personally<br>responsible but certainly on the level<br>of representation you're hearing a<br>representative of an old power that<br>heart is profoundly linguistically and<br>she did start off an Irish throne I was<br>a hire she said beautifully president<br>and friends and the at Mary McAleese the<br>Irish president was on Mike and Mary<br>McAleese said Wow<br>which is the very kind of presidential<br>thing to be her over saying and I<br>thought it was magnificent and I heard<br>her Wow in in the midst of weeping in<br>Belfast overwhelmed I've got a frog in<br>my throat not a virus and I suppose I<br>say that something because sometimes<br>forgiveness needs understood as<br>something that will open itself up it's<br>still up there and forgiveness is being<br>restored or something that will open<br>itself up slowly by slowly I think I'm<br>gonna need some more water thanks very<br>much and forgiveness can be understood<br>as something that will open itself up<br>and bit by bit supported by public<br>gesture and reminder that I still mean<br>and it's still important to say and I'll<br>follow it through with action and<br>truth-telling<br>but also public acknowledgement and<br>change and reparation and policy and<br>doing things that might make people<br>think oh for God's sake isn't that a bit<br>too much didn't we do that last year go<br>no let's do that for the next 200 why<br>don't we you've got are you coming to me<br>with alhasan shoes<br>a fisherman friend a just reveal amazing<br>honesty my favorite anything like it out<br>I'm coming back now you'll get to hear<br>me sucking in a sweet on the microphone<br>anyway and later on that next or next<br>year 2012 Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth<br>came to Belfast and shook the hand of<br>Martin McGuinness he was the deputy<br>first minister of Northern Ireland at<br>that stage he had been in the IRA he's<br>since died and they eat chess was<br>considered each other an enemy and they<br>each had been personally braved as well<br>as nationally bereaved and I was invited<br>along to be part of the group of people<br>who are witnessing the handshake and I<br>wrote a poem called shaking hands and<br>the irony of reading a poem about<br>shaking hands in a time when we can't<br>that's kind of funny but it's kind of<br>not because it shows us what what it<br>means to be a people who pay attention<br>to each other shaking hands the date is<br>what I said in Irish fresh after long<br>I've got with assiduity<br>because what's the alternative because<br>of courage because of loved ones lost<br>because no more because it's a small<br>thing shaking hands that happens every<br>day because I heard of one man whose<br>hands haven't stopped shaking since a<br>market day in Omaha because it takes a<br>second to say hate and it takes longer<br>much longer to be a great leader much<br>much longer because shared space without<br>human touching doesn't amount to much<br>because it's easier to speak to your own<br>than to hold a hand of someone whose<br>side has been previously described<br>prescribed denied because it is tough<br>because it is<br>because it is meant to be tough and this<br>is the stuff of memory the stuff of hope<br>the stuff of gesture and meaning and<br>leading because it has taken so so long<br>because it has taken land and money and<br>languages and barrels and barrels of<br>blood because lives have been lost<br>because lives have been taken because to<br>be bereaved is to be troubled by grief<br>because more than to trouble people's<br>live here because I know a woman whose<br>hand hasn't been shaken since she was a<br>man because shaking her hand is only a<br>part of the start because I know a woman<br>whose touch calmed a man whose heart was<br>breaking<br>because privilege is not to be taken<br>lightly because this just might be good<br>because who said that this would be easy<br>because some people love what you stand<br>for and for some if you can they can<br>because solidarity means a common hand<br>because a hand is only a hand so hang on<br>to it so join your much-discussed hands<br>we need this for one small second so<br>gesture is never the final word and a<br>question of serious reconciliation but<br>it's not a bad thing to include gesture<br>in a certain sense is a form of public<br>art that might be done through policy it<br>might be a little bit pompous it might<br>be this that and the other there might<br>be fancy pre describe speeches being<br>given but nonetheless it's important<br>because there's a public record being<br>given and people can turn back to that<br>it's only made really important if<br>something's follow through although ever<br>it becomes very flat very quickly if<br>it's considered to have achieved<br>everything it's simply there to support<br>it can be a great moment but a great<br>small festival of something the likes of<br>which is meant to continue year on year<br>on year for many years to be remembered<br>forgiveness is another story of<br>forgiveness I wanted to tell you is a<br>story of extraordinarily gracious<br>forgiveness and it was safe forgiveness<br>because people were able to do it and<br>not everybody has to do it yeah I think<br>forgiveness is rarely a beneficial thing<br>if people feel forced into it I'm a<br>number of years ago there was a young<br>woman in her teens who was killed in<br>Belfast by a bus that was making a<br>corner it was spectacularly poor civil<br>engineering in the way that buses had to<br>turn a sharp corner right in the city<br>centre and so often the corner of the<br>bus as it was swinging right around<br>would go on to just over the corner of a<br>very low footpath it was a footpath that<br>was kind of sloping down so she was<br>standing on the footpath coming up to<br>Christmas Keira parks was her name and<br>the boss was swinging around and the<br>bosses wouldn't be going fast but of<br>course when a vehicle is turning it's<br>going too much that the turn is<br>happening at a higher velocity anyway<br>she was killed and it was it was tragic<br>and it was gruesome the way it happened<br>and her form teacher phoned me up a few<br>weeks later and he said to me<br>know what you're doing on Monday but you<br>have to cancel it we were friends<br>you can kind of be help not just like<br>that to be friends he said I don't know<br>what you're doing on Monday but you've<br>to cancel it because the rest of Kira's<br>form class won't to write a letter to<br>the bus driver because they've been<br>thinking about him for weeks now and<br>it's your job to help us so cancel<br>whatever you do and I was doing<br>something that I didn't think I could<br>cancel for that kind of summons you know<br>came with the sense of to go my god yeah<br>so I told the people where I was<br>supposed to be I've been asked to do<br>this and they were like of course so I<br>went and I sat down with the class and<br>we had a chat<br>they loved Kira she was a great friend<br>she was a fantastic easygoing Challenger<br>of bullying her way of challenging and<br>bullying would be to say be happier<br>extraordinary thing be happier wise up<br>and be happier she'd say and wise up his<br>great belfast phrase to just say catch<br>yourself on I don't know how you say<br>that here and there might be some local<br>version presumably but why sup be<br>happier and so I said to them what would<br>you want to say to want the bus driver<br>and they said well like he wasn't doing<br>it deliberately<br>we know his life's falling apart we know<br>it probably never drive again we'd be<br>happy he drove again we get into a bus<br>if he was driving it and because the<br>rules were changed very quickly in<br>Memphis the buses don't go that way<br>anymore and they said Kira would say to<br>him be happier and they knew that that<br>part probably wasn't going to be<br>possible but they nonetheless understood<br>that there was something really<br>important that they could say to him a<br>bunch of sixteen year olds so I said<br>well but I just write out when you talk<br>so they spoke and I wrote it out and<br>then I gave it back to them and they<br>wrote<br>they all signed it and they sent it off<br>and I came away from that day feeling<br>like I was just the observer of people<br>who were doing something utterly<br>uncalled for<br>and he had done nothing wrong and<br>sometimes forgiveness can come as a gift<br>even when you know you've done nothing<br>wrong but nonetheless you hold something<br>terrible against yourself and even if<br>that's needed like that how much more so<br>when people have done something wrong<br>and refused to hold it against<br>themselves anyway a few weeks later the<br>teacher called me up and said oh there's<br>a letter back and the letter I read it<br>it's private it's beautiful and he<br>thanked them and he said and I think of<br>you every day for the rest of my life I<br>believe that was true I imagine he still<br>does and forgiveness can draw something<br>really powerful in us when it's free and<br>safe to give nobody in that class was<br>demanding that the family write such a<br>letter nobody in that fast was demanding<br>that anybody else write such a letter<br>they just wanted to assure themselves it<br>was one good response amongst many and a<br>life of grief visiting her grave every<br>day every week as often as you want is<br>also a life of never getting back in a<br>bus is also understandable and you know<br>I wouldn't say only for a while though<br>who might you know what would I know<br>about losing a child and so there's<br>something important to recognize that an<br>forgiveness must come in all kinds of<br>ways and that forgiveness and freedom<br>have something profound to say to each<br>other and those young people were free<br>and safe enough to be able to do that<br>and when forgiveness is neither free nor<br>safe it's probably not forgiveness it's<br>as we think about the complicated art of<br>reconciliation and thinking think about<br>the present really in many ways I've<br>been talking about this over and over a<br>number of years ago I'm sitting around a<br>table wasn't that long ago maybe six or<br>seven years ago sitting around a table<br>and it's a bunch of us there and there<br>was a fellow who's a friend of mine who<br>was in his 20s there was a other person<br>who's a friend of mine who was much much<br>older than all of us who was a renowned<br>person in<br>the peace industry peace negotiation the<br>response to the troubles and there's<br>other people there too and at one point<br>the the youngest person on the table<br>fell in his twenties said something<br>about the troubles and I suppose you've<br>been born maybe in the nineties maybe<br>you were the late eighties and the older<br>peace man said what would you know about<br>the trolls you're far too young to know<br>about the troubles and then this<br>happened<br>this poem is called not yet not yet<br>you're too young to know about the<br>troubles the peace man said and the<br>young man said father shot dead mother<br>fell apart brother fell into himself or<br>the brother sent to live with others and<br>me I smothered everything I was farmed<br>around and now years later we have found<br>ourselves back beneath a shared and<br>troubled scene not yet no one's too<br>young to know about the troubles when it<br>comes to thinking about questions to<br>share with reconciliation it's a<br>complicated art to recognize that the<br>people that you think who have been hurt<br>it's not everybody who's been hurt<br>people may not wish to wish to tell you<br>you might have a clear narrative about<br>who the perpetrator was who the victim<br>was and who the innocent were who the<br>people who were the unaffected were you<br>might have absolutely no idea and this<br>young man whose details I changed<br>totally because I were to keep the exact<br>formulation of family members and their<br>people were gone too<br>I know who the family are and so that<br>wouldn't have been fair my joy I did say<br>to my friend and he went i'd have been<br>thrilled to forget all the details and<br>but i just thought well it's that's him<br>it is to say but not necessarily his own<br>family the rest of his family's things<br>stretch on for as long as they take pain<br>will take as long to de-escalate as it<br>to escalate on serious serious levels<br>colonization takes a long time to<br>dismantle the strange thing is is that<br>sometimes colonization can seem to be um<br>built up very quickly lasts a very long<br>time and then we imagine that it can be<br>undone very quickly and then it's done<br>magnificent we're in a post-colonial<br>world now apparently magnificent all<br>those languages that are eradicated are<br>back all those traditional lands that<br>were held are also back people are free<br>to consider what form of governance and<br>power decision-making structures that we<br>know are inherent in the languages that<br>we speak are all living and thriving in<br>our post-colonial world well done<br>everyone<br>we've done brilliantly i'm obviously<br>being an idiot and i don't know what it<br>means to look at reparation i don't know<br>what it means to say well what change is<br>serious do we need to put in place but<br>the changes that have been done are so<br>serious as to be the genocide and<br>decimation of the only right words so<br>the changes that we put in place and<br>should hurt every we should you know<br>calling a place in your name in an<br>original language doesn't hurt it's just<br>awkward if that isn't your first<br>language that's not pain anybody can<br>suffered will tell you what pain is<br>anybody who was at their language<br>removed from them will tell us what pain<br>is we know this from both sides I'm sure<br>people here have been on the side of<br>receiving this and on the side of and<br>benefiting from it not necessarily doing<br>it ourselves we know this from multiple<br>sites and we hope<br>I hope an ache that the complicated<br>discussions about what does it mean<br>seriously to take the ethic of living<br>together and they here now doing as much<br>as is possible<br>in the here and now for a very long time<br>look like to find some cohabiting<br>together in the places that we are when<br>it comes to thinking about time also and<br>thinking about pain and forgiveness<br>I recognize that people will need to<br>carry protections for a very long time<br>there's a story told about Carmela in<br>the 1970s and so many people were being<br>put out of their houses in the early<br>1970s and Belfast people will be told<br>you know you're usually was that your<br>husband is suspected of being treasurer<br>or your wife or a woman and living in<br>the house is suspecting of having being<br>a treasure or you know all kinds of<br>accusations will be told would be made<br>about being a traitor and people will be<br>told you have an hour to get out of the<br>house before it's set alight and so<br>they'd have an hour to pack and go and<br>corrymeela had a boss and would drive to<br>people's homes if they were called and<br>would pick them up and take them to<br>Carmela for a period of time before<br>people would organize something else<br>devastating to have that happen to your<br>family it's made it's discovered an<br>estimated know that fully half of the<br>IRA council were probably informants to<br>the British government so like it wasn't<br>like there was only a few and presumably<br>many of the people accusing others of<br>being informants were informants<br>themselves who were doing that to cover<br>their own back because they were likely<br>a being found out and so you see the<br>dirty handedness of everything that's<br>happening in this a woman was given a<br>short amount of time to get out of her<br>house and and she came up to Carmela she<br>was picked up in that bus and she had<br>absolutely no idea who these kind of<br>well-meaning ecumenical Christians were<br>who were saying oh we've got a place<br>where you can stay lovely lovely she's<br>in panic no she's just taking the first<br>thing absolutely no idea are these<br>people first of all is this who are they<br>are they occult totally these are<br>serious and important and good questions<br>to ask will they allow me to leave you<br>know all those serious questions<br>anyway so she packed bags hurriedly for<br>herself and her children and she packed<br>a hatchet also put it in her bag<br>thinking I'm not sure what's gonna<br>happen in that place I need to be<br>prepared and I think about that hatchet<br>so often and we use the phrase when we<br>talk about forgiveness and bury the<br>hatchet I think sometimes we need to use<br>the phrase pack the hatchet<br>not because I'm advocating violence at<br>all should make that very clear and I<br>mean god only knows what she was a plan<br>to have done with the hatchet<br>you know you don't know that it was a<br>particularly huge oh no no she had an<br>enormous suitcase do you know anyway but<br>it's a symbol for me of being ready to<br>say I have learned something from this<br>and I need to have something in my<br>future to be prepared and I need to<br>unfortunately ask new questions now as I<br>come to being a responsible person and<br>we do that as people and we also do that<br>as countries and I think it's an<br>important thing to recognize that when<br>somebody seems defensive and perhaps<br>that's for a very fine reason because<br>they didn't act you know I've been in<br>situations sometimes where you know<br>somebody said something pretty awful<br>about gay people and somebody in the<br>room will say oh well they'll say<br>something back and sort of gold don't be<br>so defensive<br>like hmm maybe you shouldn't be so<br>attacking and then we might find a way<br>I've written down here and<br>Reconciliation isn't about being<br>dangerous I think I meant to write down<br>in my notes reconciliation is about<br>being dangerous but I don't know the<br>dangerous is is the word I think there<br>is always going to be a risk there will<br>never be the moment when your engage in<br>the process of reconciliation and<br>dialogue with each other where you think<br>okay everything's planned the process of<br>gesture now of making a public statement<br>of showing that I'm engaging in<br>conversation with this person where I<br>might be worried about whether the<br>people who follow me will follow along<br>with this know that I'm showing that I'm<br>capable of having at least a civic<br>conversation with this person that will<br>never be perfectly predictable that will<br>always need to be led into in families<br>in processes where churches are deeply<br>split in processes where communities are<br>deeply but I'm not only talking about<br>major international pains I'm also<br>talking about the kind of pains that can<br>split a community straight a village<br>there's always going to be the need of<br>somebody to say but here's something I<br>want to try it isn't to say that<br>everybody has to do it but it is to say<br>that it is it should be okay to say I<br>want to take this moment now to try<br>something here and that is always going<br>to feel like a risk and even if it's<br>so-called successful probably afterwards<br>you regret it and then you'll be glad in<br>regret and then you'll be glad there's a<br>cycle that's always the way and that's<br>fine<br>when you say I've forgiven you to<br>somebody who you've forgiven for<br>something serious<br>there'll be tomorrow when you won't and<br>then tomorrow when you will and then<br>tomorrow when you forget about it and<br>then the day when you remember it and<br>think have I or haven't died yet<br>you live with it it comes back it's the<br>same with people it's the same with<br>countries it's the same with all these<br>things and we need to find ways I think<br>in our pulpit processes of practicing<br>this complicated art of reconciliation<br>of recognizing the circular nature of<br>these things they come they go<br>and that's fine and that there's wisdom<br>actually returning to the anchor and<br>returning to the dignity of saying I<br>to forgive I don't want to be reconciled<br>there's wisdom in returning to that<br>knowing that it's a cycle going well the<br>next time I go back to that I wonder<br>what questions I'll ask myself not to<br>force myself out of it but to see what<br>the landscape is from here and does it<br>look any different to how it look the<br>last time I was here wherever we are on<br>that way and I think that is the<br>complicated art of forgiveness is to<br>recognize that we're in a relationship<br>with it it isn't to just settle down and<br>to accept something that's unacceptable<br>and it comes to serious processes that<br>need to be advocated through with policy<br>but even when the policy is all done<br>we'll still need to continue to ask<br>questions of ourselves<br>the corrymeela community was set up in<br>1965 by Ray Davey a Presbyterian<br>minister he had seen the devastation of<br>Dresden he had been a prisoner of war<br>outside Dresden when it was fire bombed<br>and that experienced children that the<br>idea of annihilating your enemy in the<br>name of peace it's probably some of the<br>human beings continue to return to and<br>would return to in Ireland he became a<br>chaplain and Queen's University from 45<br>to 65 at which stage piece of land<br>became available with a house on that<br>house that piece of land being called<br>corrymeela and so they found this Center<br>as a place mostly initially where<br>students Presbyterian students could go<br>to learn and to study with each other<br>and be with each other over weekends and<br>summer programs and other kinds of<br>programs to argue with each other to<br>talk about religion to talk about<br>politics to talk about the past to vote<br>entirely differently to each other to<br>believe entirely differently to each<br>other but to know people who believe<br>differently because silos were dangerous<br>then and they're dangerous now and so<br>saying we need something that will<br>provide the possibility of people<br>meeting people and corrymeela there are<br>painful stories about how it began<br>apparently there was a few other people<br>that would have liked to been the leader<br>and at least one and Ray Davy was the<br>one who became the leader a lot of<br>people don't know that story I didn't<br>know it until close the end of my time<br>as<br>of CoroMill and I've come to the<br>conclusion that it's very difficult to<br>know what good is it's very easy to<br>diagnose what good is when you're not<br>involved it's very difficult to know<br>what good is when you're when you are<br>involved and it's a lonely place to be<br>in a position of trying to say what is<br>the good now what is why is I wish I had<br>perspective in order to go to know what<br>the good is now in order to be able to<br>set something up that has the right<br>policies from day one and I don't<br>believe that that's possible<br>so I admire people who are setting<br>things up that go we think this is good<br>enough now and we're open to hearing but<br>regularly what I hear is that people<br>saying it wasn't good enough now you<br>should shut it down somebody else should<br>be doing it and I feel like that kind of<br>certain addiction to purity can be<br>pretty awful because nothing's gonna be<br>perfect but sometimes in the name of the<br>perfect and nothing gets done in the<br>name of trying to be the everything we<br>do nothing and I think it can be<br>beneficial sometimes in the name of<br>knowing we can't do the everything to do<br>something provided that something is<br>humble I regularly see people doing to<br>something and calling it the everything<br>and I wish that they learn a few lessons<br>I don't want them to stop but I do I<br>would like them to go we know that<br>there's been people here doing this<br>before us I've seen plenty of LGBT<br>organizations for young Christian people<br>they set up in the last few years let's<br>say we are the foremost and doing the<br>most important work in you know<br>supporting LGBT people you know and then<br>I see people whose lives put at risk as<br>they were campaigning for<br>decriminalization be ignored and that is<br>a terrible pain for a legacy of people<br>who have put their lives at risk to see<br>I see this happen in so many places I'm<br>very involved in the LGBT and faith<br>advocacy sector and so I've seen it<br>happen in many jurisdictions where and<br>the brilliance of the latest idea of<br>their deepest engage<br>of the policy change of whatever the<br>brilliance of that people have mistaken<br>the brilliance of the think it's the<br>brilliance of everything instead of<br>going oh or another piece of the jigsaw<br>fantastic there'll be another piece<br>after us we hope they'll remember us in<br>the way we remember the others but often<br>there is arrogance that creeps into all<br>those places and we fight amongst each<br>other and then the people who hate are<br>so delighted to go look at them they<br>can't even agree with each other<br>divide and conquer working all over<br>again it's terrible we're doing it to<br>ourselves and so I think that we need to<br>be very aware in being present in the<br>moment even with an idea that's<br>innovative and that part the idea hasn't<br>happened before<br>in the complicated art of reconciliation<br>there should be the deference to say<br>people have been doing this before me I<br>hope I know the men can give them the<br>honor but even if I don't I should make<br>sure to always say people were doing<br>this before me and there should never be<br>the need to prove the perfection of the<br>original group the original group is<br>probably as flimsy and awkward and<br>complicated as any of us when I was<br>leader Carmela I was leader during the<br>fiftieth anniversary and I was present<br>at a meeting a luncheon and whereas many<br>of the original members who were alive<br>and were mobile were able to be there<br>one of the original members roped them<br>all and he said em thirty six of us are<br>alive I know he said 42 of us are alive<br>but about nine of us are barely able to<br>move so I proposed that the other 33 was<br>made for luncheon here's the time it was<br>a very easy straightforward man and they<br>all arrived and they spoke about bravery<br>and they spoke about being young people<br>being part of something and then they<br>spoke about their ailments and their<br>sore hips and I was a third of the age<br>of many of them and it was overwhelming<br>and brilliant and moving and I met<br>people who were held in the most<br>enormous esteem a founder of Caramella<br>and saying in a clue<br>but thanks for remembering us and here's<br>the people you're not remembering and<br>here's the way that you've made the<br>story of its founding a little bit too<br>sparkly tell the old sparkly bits and I<br>found that to be really important in the<br>complicated art of reconciliation we<br>often want the complicated art of<br>reconciliation to have a shiny ending it<br>usually doesn't community whether it's<br>yoga group or a Christian group or a<br>peace activism group or any kind of<br>group can make great promises and we can<br>invest community with the deepest<br>yearning to belong that we have and I<br>think one of the only things that<br>community will provide is disappointment<br>and that is an important thing to say<br>and I don't say that as a cynic because<br>I've been part of communities my whole<br>life but to imagine that communities are<br>going to be the thing that would be the<br>thing that you need the thing to be and<br>it won't there's no replacement for the<br>inner life the inner life will always<br>require us to have a certain quality of<br>relationship to self that will sustain<br>us in the imperfections of what<br>relationship with each other mean and<br>psychoanalyst Lacan said that groups are<br>built on miscommunication which<br>sometimes surprised we have a<br>miscommunication as if that isn't<br>happening<br>on every single level of every single<br>communication<br>it's amazing we get anything<br>communicated at all so I do think that<br>we need to find ways to be in profound<br>relationship to the question of our self<br>and I have a poem here called how to be<br>alone how to be alone it all begins with<br>knowing nothing lasts forever so you<br>might as well start packing now<br>in the meantime practice being alive<br>there will be a party where you'll feel<br>like nobody's paying you attention and<br>there will be a party where attentions<br>all you'll get what you need to do is to<br>remember how to talk to yourself between<br>these parties and again there will be a<br>day a decade where you won't fit in with<br>your body even though you're in the only<br>body you're in you need to control your<br>habit of forgetting to breathe remember<br>when you were younger and you practiced<br>kissing on your arm you were on to<br>sometimes harm knows its own healing<br>comfort knows its own intelligence<br>kindness - it needs no reason there is a<br>you telling you another story of you<br>listen to her where do you feel anxiety<br>in your body the chest the fist the<br>dream before waking the head that feels<br>like it's at the top of the swing or the<br>clutch of gut like falling and falling<br>and falling and falling it knows<br>something<br>you're dying try to stay alive for now<br>touch yourself I'm serious touch<br>yourself take your hand and place your<br>hand<br>someplace upon your body and listen to<br>the community of madness that you are<br>you are such an interesting conversation<br>I want to finish and I have more poems<br>that I'm going to do but I want to<br>finish by thinking about the future and<br>in as much as talking about the future<br>in the last session I want to say that I<br>don't necessarily believe the future<br>exists unless we're doing it now<br>there's no point imagining that the<br>future will be fill it full of<br>extraordinarily courageous moments of<br>leadership in your organization unless<br>you're kind of taking an extraordinarily<br>courageous moment which is always done<br>in the here and now not the future maybe<br>we can do bits that build up but there<br>always need to be action that's why I'm<br>so interested in the body in that poem<br>it's so much about touch and touch is so<br>tangible it's a sacrament available to<br>everybody to yourself and this vast of<br>touching that we're on during this<br>outbreak I suppose<br>might make us attentive to the touching<br>of the self to the self and I mean that<br>in all the ways that it can possibly<br>revenge because we need to find a way to<br>speak honestly about the sexual touch of<br>self to self we need to find ways about<br>the pleasurable touch yourself to self<br>or the hateful touch yourself to self<br>and find ways to have that conversation<br>with the community of madness that we<br>are in order to consider what might it<br>be like to have that conversation with<br>others - as I think about the future<br>that doesn't exist yet and the moments<br>in the present that I would like to see<br>as I think of the complicated art of<br>reconciliation what I want to finish<br>with I'm not saying that this is what<br>needs to happen but it's what I would<br>like to see is particularly directed<br>toward M me and other men which is the<br>recognition that there are crises of<br>masculinity what does it mean to be a<br>man somebody wants us races so many<br>reason he was speaking to me about<br>ordinary men was they cool right tell me<br>about ordinary men who like you know men<br>who are being ignored now because people<br>are challenging them right okay I wasn't<br>an ordinary man I was a before I<br>knew what a was you know I was<br>told from the word go at home at school<br>and church everywhere that um you're a<br>failure and I'm a white fella goes well<br>in school you know able-bodied you know<br>so I've got a lot going for me and I<br>grew up with a leprosy a pathological<br>burden of self abhorrence and I have a<br>lot of work to do when it comes to the<br>question of practicing what it means to<br>be a man<br>practicing what power means practicing<br>what gentleness means practicing the<br>recognition that the old repeated<br>storyline of of dominance as possible<br>and typically the world lends itself to<br>men seeking darkness and I think there<br>are ways within which when this is<br>difficult for us to hear we need to know<br>let me meet with other men and talk<br>together about this not in the way we<br>say can you believe those stupid<br>liberals because it's not just stupid<br>liberals saying it it's intelligent<br>wants to<br>and intelligent conservatives and<br>intelligent people who are neither all<br>kinds of people all kinds of men need to<br>say this to all kinds of men because one<br>of the things I see is a failure of the<br>project of being whatever-the-hell a<br>real man is I don't know what that is<br>there can be all kinds of shapes to it<br>but certainly when I see people self<br>congratulating themselves from<br>boisterousness and public bullying<br>through policy and in government I think<br>that the complicated art of<br>reconciliation is going to get a lot<br>more complicated a lot more confronting<br>because we have a lot more calling out<br>of things and telling the truth to power<br>to do so I have a few poems about<br>masculinity and then we finish and I was<br>in a bar in Birmingham ordering a pint<br>and I live in the north of Ireland where<br>sterling like British money operates but<br>Northern Ireland and Scotland can print<br>their own if any of you being there you<br>know this and if you go to England and<br>you've got a 20 pound note from a<br>northern ireland bank and you go to buy<br>a pint with that regularly in england<br>people that's irish morning you're like<br>no it's british money for God's sake do<br>you not know anything about your history<br>so Scottish people the same when they<br>bring Scottish 20-pound notes stone<br>people will say oh we can't take<br>Scottish money like of course he can't<br>like it's called the United Kingdom for<br>a reason anyway I was in a bar with a<br>friend on a Saturday sunny Saturday<br>afternoon truth be told we were avoiding<br>a theological lecture on Trinitarian<br>theology<br>and given by a very eminent Dominican<br>priest - I was I felt absolute people<br>will drink so a few pints for the<br>afternoon was much more preferable and<br>we went and we paid no attention<br>whatsoever we just walked to the nearest<br>bar in Birmingham and I said first<br>rounds on me because there were going to<br>be many and when he my friend went and<br>sat down and then this happened the poem<br>is called enjoy your pint at the bar in<br>an unknown part of Birmingham I bought<br>two pints and paid with paper money from<br>the northern part of Ireland that's not<br>British money the publican said and I<br>said yes it is you'll see the Royal head<br>if you'll hold it to the light and a man<br>standing right beside me turned to me<br>and looked and said so you're from<br>Northern Ireland he was wearing denim<br>jeans and a denim jacket tobacco fingers<br>fixed around a half-drunk point he<br>locked his eyes on me and moved so near<br>I could have kissed him whose side are<br>you on son he whispered whose side are<br>you on<br>and I didn't know the landscape of<br>belonging in this part of England I<br>hadn't seen science enough to know<br>whether hope through for the orange or<br>the green he continued to look he<br>continued to keep close and I said I<br>hope for peace and he said that's a<br>clever answer son that's a very clever<br>it's pretty much word-for-word what<br>happened I brought I was shaking because<br>they were so threatening I went down to<br>Martin my friend shaking sat down took a<br>drink and he said what was that I told<br>him he goes let's go we then began to<br>look around the pub and realized we have<br>chosen the wrong pub and we were so<br>shook instead of I mean Birmingham is an<br>extraordinary city I love so many cities<br>in England I love but instead of finding<br>another city another pub in a that<br>fantastic city we went back to the<br>theological lectures idiots it's the<br>intimacy that's involved in violence<br>here in this I suppose I'm curious about<br>that close personal intimacy like<br>honestly I could feel a whisper of his<br>lips on my cheek like he wasn't planning<br>on kissing me what would have happened<br>if I had was this some homoerotic play<br>note what is the strange masculinity of<br>intimacy that's involved in these games<br>what's going on and this both in<br>factorization and familiarity in this<br>words son who so you are son and then<br>that's awful setting up of a test that I<br>don't know how to pass that's a clever<br>answer son that's a very clever answer I<br>don't want to pass your test I don't<br>want to be in your test what is that why<br>do we do that to each other as men but<br>I'm not going to say that women do or<br>don't do that or that there there's<br>other ways that's not my interest really<br>my interest is for men to think about<br>the way that men<br>and to speak to other men when men are<br>behaving in the way that men behave why<br>don't we do that I don't mean to shame<br>people and to call people out of them to<br>say you're out of the friendship group<br>but to say what's going on like Joe I'd<br>like to have a conversation instead of<br>us sitting here laughing at trans people<br>now we're sitting here saying whatever<br>it is that it's going on or sitting here<br>laughing at people who vote for the<br>Conservative Party as if they're idiots<br>why do we need victims so often I've<br>heard so many people say societies built<br>on organized groups of people always<br>requiring a scapegoat that they<br>sacrifice in order for their own purity<br>the stories of those are mostly written<br>about men so I'm not entirely sure it's<br>fair to say societies a bit like that<br>and they're often written by European<br>men so I'm not sure it's fair to say<br>that all societies are like that I think<br>it's interesting to reflect on white men<br>what's our practice of ourselves because<br>I like being a white man a hundred I<br>plan on continuing to be one but I I do<br>hope that there can be a joint project<br>of it not being seen as a failure of the<br>project of masculinity as we look at the<br>complicated art of reconciliation and<br>pay attention to the impact that white<br>men gay and straight bisexual to have<br>done in the need for reconciliation in<br>the world<br>there's requirement and I have come to<br>the conclusion that gentleness is a is a<br>kind of strength that's worthwhile I've<br>tried to practice and cultivate whether<br>it comes naturally or not it isn't a bad<br>thing to try to put into a day I'm<br>getting very very friendly smiles from<br>Philip in the back which i think is an<br>invitation to stop delighting you that's<br>a little quote from Pride and Prejudice<br>you've delighted us long enough</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
