It’s also a region of central political, economic and cultural importance to the affairs of this millennium. Studying Asian culture, languages and literature at Victoria University of Wellington will captivate you and broaden your world view. It's also a smart career move. In an increasingly globalised world, people who can bridge gaps with Asia are in demand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it's really important to study Asia and<br>its languages at least from a New<br>Zealand context in the sense that New<br>Zealand is in the asia-pacific if you<br>look at international relations and<br>where a lot of power houses are I think<br>a lot of those are within Asia and it<br>never hurts to learn a language<br>especially one that's very different<br>from your own I think it's a good chance<br>for people to expand their skills and do<br>something now I think the importance of<br>studying Asian as languages already<br>comes down to cultural diversity Asia<br>can seem like quite a far-off place but<br>through studying the languages are<br>differently feels like it becomes a<br>little closer upward to Japan three<br>times now and each time have had more of<br>a command of the language speaking the<br>language is different we made a<br>difference what I put over there in the<br>21st century it is imperative for an<br>educated person to be a global citizen<br>because all countries are increasingly<br>and closely interconnected in the 21st<br>century which some people call the<br>asia-pacific century having ability to<br>understand languages cultures and<br>history of China Japan and other parts<br>of Asia is a very important skill Jabbar<br>300 for me has been a bit of a journey<br>because I learned so much in just a<br>short period of time along with me on<br>that journey was both my classmates<br>and the lecturers and tutors which I had<br>for that course students who study<br>Japanese and Chinese languages come from<br>diverse backgrounds and they have many<br>different reasons to study those<br>subjects some of them chose to study<br>Japanese and in Chinese because they are<br>their heritage languages some of them<br>want to work or live in those countries<br>in the future and some are interested in<br>popular cultures and the histories of<br>those countries studying in Wellington<br>is pretty interesting the struggle to go<br>down the street without caring the<br>languages being spoken around it lots of<br>opportunities to learn such as the<br>embassies from language clubs around<br>town so I definitely recommend it I feel<br>really safe in the environment that Java<br>has created for me I know everyone in my<br>course and I don't feel bad about making<br>mistakes and trying my best<br>we are here to lead you to a journey of<br>discovery and we want to help you to<br>find out what's the most exciting the<br>vibra societies in Asia and the world<br>today</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
