"this<br>is gonna be so hard", "you know the<br>expectations are so high and workloads<br>gonna be like... woah". I went and had a chat<br>with my boss about it and he said look<br>he felt exactly the same when he started<br>as his MBA, just see how it goes and it was<br>pretty much repeating what my wife<br>told me so I did, I sucked it up and I<br>stuck with it.<br>I'm not gonna say it<br>became easier but I felt that I could<br>manage it.<br>I've also found that working<br>with other groups of students was really<br>helpful because often it's only when you<br>are working together that you sort of<br>get a problem from different perspectives.<br>An old MBA student gave<br>me of advice which was<br>"keep your foot on the accelerator"  but it's very<br>manageable with a wife,<br>family, and pets, and Saturday sport.<br>I've really found that have spending one night a week<br>for a trimester was not onerous it was<br>really nice to kind of go out and see<br>our friends that we'd made in the MBA and<br>just get a chance to catch up with<br>everybody.<br>I worked for the Health<br>Promotion Agency and they're really Pro<br>studying and when I asked them about<br>supporting me with an MBA they were<br>really keen to do it so we came up with<br>a package that allowed me some study<br>time when I needed it and that allowed<br>me to mix some of the work things I<br>needed to get across with my<br>assignment topics and they also were<br>really generous with some funding for the degree.<br>I didn't feel in the end that it cost me anything personally in my family life to do this work.<br>It was all down to careful planning.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
