John's in the city for the<br>kind and warm welcome and the artistry<br>really of the way that Alastair and Jeff<br>and Philip have put together and a<br>program that has had me looking forward<br>to it for months and months and months<br>so I have to come back so that was kind<br>of a demands rather than a promise I<br>think we should be feeling sorry for the<br>people who are like Oh God<br>we've organised another version of this<br>so but I really am enormously grateful<br>thank you so much and also in the midst<br>of at the beginning of the wave of<br>things changing may we all find the<br>fortitude and the practice of the heart<br>as well as the practice of profound<br>safety and protection of each other as<br>we look at the ways within which things<br>that we thought were really important<br>and are become less important in light<br>of other things for ourselves and for<br>others this is an arch as spiritual arch<br>really that the word is being put into<br>so the overall theme for tonight is<br>stories of trouble and peace and then<br>we're going to think in the first part<br>of our telling the truth about power the<br>best way that I know how to talk is to<br>read poems and then to talk a little bit<br>in between the poems and most of them<br>are depressing so and from time to time<br>I'll say something funny in between but<br>only from time to time<br>I think and the way I'm going to look at<br>each one each section at each lecture<br>tonight is going to be split up into<br>looking at the past the present in the<br>future I a few years ago took a safari<br>through the work of Emily Dickinson it<br>took me two years I read or seventeen<br>hundred and seventy-five of her poems<br>and in the morning times I get up early<br>and I would read some work of hers and<br>it did feel a little bit like happen<br>about a liter of whisky for the<br>intellect I too much an absolutely<br>unsure about what I'm capable of doing<br>afterwards and if somebody said and what<br>happened while you were doing it like I<br>have no idea it's very hard to recall<br>and once you've been taking a war I walk<br>through the wild world of Emily<br>Dickinson 1830 to 1886 she said<br>extraordinary things like the soul has<br>bandaged moments when she dances like a<br>bomb abroad who wrote that in 1860 when<br>she was an edited in a way she didn't<br>like show me a ton of her poems<br>published when she was edited in a way<br>she didn't like she wrote a poem where<br>she says amputate my freckled bosom who<br>at one point she's speaking about the<br>bubbling it's a beautiful songbird and<br>she says the bobbolinks are gone the<br>rowdy of the meadow and no one Swagger's<br>now but me who uses the word swagger for<br>himself today she did then so one of her<br>obsessions is time not that she says one<br>of my obsessions is time but after<br>having been taken a steady injection of<br>her every day for two years including<br>her letters which are magnificent and I<br>began to realize that I was thinking<br>about Thai and I said why am I thinking<br>about time all the time and I was like<br>oh I know because Emily Dickinson writes<br>things like the past is such a curious<br>creature to look her in the face<br>transport may reward you or a disgrace<br>she says things like that and over and<br>over again time crops up in her work and<br>so as a result of that um not as an<br>homage to Emily Dickinson but because I<br>think she's on to something we're gonna<br>think about questions of our trouble and<br>peace about power and reconciliation and<br>complicated arts in terms of the past<br>the present in the future and then my<br>favorite bridges toward the end and<br>where we'll have a chance to have some<br>conversations and mostly it's my own<br>poems but I have some poems of other<br>people am i speaking loud enough can you<br>hear me great I'm starting off with a<br>poem by the Magnificent poet and Lauren<br>a courtesan Dorner courtesan is has just<br>finished a three-year term as poet<br>laureate of Jamaica she has been writing<br>for 40 years strain during initially as<br>a painter and her themes and work are<br>overwhelming and wide-reaching<br>she writes about matriarchy in Jamaica<br>issue as brilliantly about all kinds of<br>versions of religion and her deepest<br>brilliance is both about place as well<br>as the long legacy of the war of<br>colonization and her book aura cabeza is<br>a book where she and in person went to<br>visit many play<br>and wrote from the point of view of<br>those places including places like this<br>one Spain where the initial so-called<br>explorers had come to the so-called new<br>world and here's a poem called reporting<br>back to Queen Isabella from the book or<br>a cabeza and Queen Isabella was the of<br>Isabella and Ferdinand and Isabella was<br>she had a lisp and and because she had a<br>lisp her they were trying to standardize<br>Spanish as a as a particular dialect as<br>a way of determining Empire in Spain<br>because obviously Spain as a place of<br>kingdoms not a kingdom and dialects and<br>languages and so because she had a lisp<br>ever but they decided that everybody<br>should have a lisp and that's why now<br>I'm not making that up that's why<br>Spanish Spanish and speak says Valencia<br>other than Valencia so listen to this<br>reporting back to Queen Isabella this is<br>Christopher Columbus coming back from<br>his voyage it's all reporting back to<br>Queen Isabella when Don Cristobal<br>returned to a hero's welcome<br>his caravels corked with treasures of<br>the new world he presented his findings<br>told of his great adventures to Queen<br>Isabella whose speech set the gold<br>standard for her nation's language when<br>he came to Jamaica<br>he described its soul the fairest isle<br>that eyes ever beheld then he balled up<br>a big parchment unclenched and let it<br>fall off a flat surface before it landed<br>at her feet there we were massives high<br>mountain ranges expansive plains deep<br>valleys one he christened for the Queen<br>of Spain overabundance of wood over 100<br>rivers food and fat pastures for Spanish<br>horses men and cattle and yes your<br>when it comes to thinking about the past<br>as we think of telling the truth about<br>power I think it is impossible for our<br>world to think about the past without<br>having a language to speak today about<br>the truth about the power of the last I<br>suppose four hundred five hundred years<br>of Christian is to expansion across the<br>globe I call a Christian is to<br>deliberately it's meant to be<br>provocative to not have an understanding<br>of the way that hand-in-glove power<br>conquest absolute entitlement to places<br>that were already discovered and that<br>were not part of any new world we were<br>part of the world that was as young and<br>as old as of the rest of the place we<br>cannot speak about today taking in mind<br>borders taking in mind languages that<br>will never exist again languages that<br>have been forgotten unless we were<br>willing to tell the truth about the<br>power of that and not to use words like<br>oh the Age of Exploration it was an age<br>of genocide it was an age of entitlement<br>it was an age of war these are the kinds<br>of words we need to use there is power<br>and those it's uncomfortable because we<br>need to re-examine the stories of people<br>in our families maybe a long time ago<br>maybe not such a long time ago maybe my<br>very own self this is uncomfortable but<br>we demanded of other people so why<br>shouldn't we demand it of ourselves this<br>is the cold horse there's such<br>extraordinary and exciting and wonderful<br>and terrible detail in this porn Don<br>Christopher returned to a hero's welcome<br>his keroro cork with treasures of the<br>new world his great adventures and then<br>he describes to make as if the eyes of<br>beholding it almost for the first time<br>it was already beheld dirty and then<br>there's this bawling of a big sheet of<br>parchment and rolling it across a table<br>like it's the world falling off the edge<br>of itself which was presumably what that<br>was like for people who were living<br>there thorn ago - since brilliant line<br>there we were<br>we lose the way massives I interviewed<br>Lorna Goodison recently and she told me<br>that that's a bit of a slang word a<br>patois word for like dude back home in<br>Jamaica<br>so she's meaning massives in terms of<br>the geographical term but it's coming<br>across there as a little small way to<br>slip in humanity high mountain ranges<br>expansive Plains deep valleys what he'd<br>christened for the queen of Spain is if<br>the valley didn't have a name it's all<br>of itself already overabundance of wood<br>over 100 horses 100 rivers food and fat<br>pastures for Spanish horses men and<br>cattle that list is such an important<br>feature because Christopher Columbus<br>couldn't have made that list by himself<br>who's he with what's the danger of<br>participating saying I'm just an<br>administrator I was just counting rivers<br>who had the time how many people would<br>it take to traverse Jamaica I've been<br>there it's not small to come that they<br>were 100 separate rivers administration<br>can be its own evil when you're not<br>asking serious questions and yes your<br>majesty there were some people last word<br>and this is people and after thought<br>almost falling off the edge of the point<br>how do we understand this when it comes<br>to telling the truth about power here's<br>a poem from Ireland my great-great<br>granddad my granddad's granddad was a<br>young boy during the time of the famine<br>the Irish the famine in Ireland we don't<br>call it the potato famine because it<br>wasn't there was a plate of light but it<br>was plenty of food a million people died<br>in three years the population from 1845<br>was nine and a half million by 1880 it<br>was four million the Irish population<br>has never recovered and the whole time<br>Marlon was providing 60% of the beef and<br>I think 70% of the corn that was feeding<br>the island of Britain which has a heart<br>fire higher<br>than the Irish population does people<br>who were soon about to die were still<br>loading ships full of food to go off<br>there had been a request to close the<br>ports very pertinent to think about that<br>today<br>thinking of closing ports but the answer<br>came back from some politicians not from<br>the people of England the people of<br>England are good people I've been there<br>many times but for some politicians<br>saying if there are fewer Irish people<br>at the end of this saga so much the<br>better you can look it up<br>so my great-great granddad Irish speaker<br>West Cork was being brought along to a<br>soup kitchen by his parents him and his<br>brother and some soup kitchens were run<br>locally some soup kitchens were run by<br>volunteers some soup kitchens were run<br>in a way where if you became a<br>Protestant you could get soup so hence<br>in Ireland some of the complication of a<br>Catholic Protestant it's got nothing to<br>do with God or purgatory or Mary<br>everything to do with the memory of this<br>telling the truth about power is a<br>painful thing my great-great granddad<br>was I think six and he got lost in the<br>crowd obviously it was huge crowds<br>looking for food again doesn't that make<br>us think of today and he never saw the<br>rest of his family again<br>as far as we know the entire part of his<br>whole family was wiped out and a<br>Protestant family in the neighborhood<br>who didn't speak Irish and found them<br>and took them in and kept them for five<br>years quite extraordinary<br>apparently the dad of that family I am<br>used to say to him<br>you're clever like let us put you<br>through school right to the end but he<br>was desperate to find family so he<br>walked about 40 45 miles to Cork City<br>maybe a bit longer fifty-five and got a<br>job in a factory and any day off he had<br>which presumably would have been written<br>in irregular he would walk as far west<br>as he could asking had anybody got news<br>of his family apparently until the end<br>of his life it's the story in the family<br>and before he died that okla parish<br>priest arranged for my great-great<br>granddad to make his confirmation<br>because obviously things like sacraments<br>were forgotten and you know during a<br>time when such a population is dying and<br>people are being buried in mass graves<br>so here's a little pan - or here's a<br>little villanelle anybody who's<br>interested in poetry called the family<br>it's actually called the potato famine<br>but the word potatoes crossed out my<br>father likes his spots piled high upon<br>his plate my mother likes her peace and<br>her diet magazines my great-great<br>granddad was the only one who made it at<br>the heart of every famine is the<br>scheming of the state to bring a people<br>to their knees for the state's<br>convenience my father likes his spots<br>piled high upon his plate on the phone<br>an English woman says the Irish are<br>fixated with our stories of the past in<br>a way that's quite obscene but my<br>great-great granddad was the only one<br>who made it my auntie moved to England<br>and learned how to translate between the<br>way people are and the way their<br>histories been my father likes his spots<br>piled high upon his plate there are<br>proteins in our grass from forgotten<br>famine graves<br>some families fared on rotten grass and<br>my mother tells me my granddad's<br>granddad was the only one who made it<br>his family had all starved so he missed<br>his confirmation decades later a priest<br>arranged it didn't make a scene my<br>father likes his spots piled high upon<br>his plate and my great-great granddad<br>was the only one who made it the last<br>few years of brexit and lots of Irish<br>people have been speaking about the<br>impact of brexit on what is regularly by<br>the BBC called the Irish border we like<br>to remind them that it's a British<br>border in Ireland we didn't draw the<br>damn thing<br>so I speaking to somebody once and they<br>said Oh can't you just get over at the<br>past and your border like it's almost<br>100 years ago when I was like two days<br>ago I got a green card through the mail<br>saying that I need to carry this with me<br>if I'm ever driving across the border in<br>case I'm stuck by somebody saying are<br>you insured to drive over here over here<br>as opposed to there<br>there's farm houses through which the<br>border runs there's hundreds of miles of<br>farmland where people would be keeping<br>cattle on both sides of that farm what<br>are they supposed to do when<br>jurisdictions and today are changed as a<br>result of brexit next year we've no idea<br>because the changes are ideological it's<br>not because they're saying we want<br>better ones<br>these are crap we want to improve it and<br>they're saying we want our ones just<br>because we want them ours and Irish<br>people are saying you need to consider<br>us and they're like stop going on about<br>the past and this is and really put huge<br>strain on British Irish relations of the<br>last numbers on governmental level and<br>on family level it has really put a<br>strain and it has really brought many<br>surfaces about how Irish people find it<br>fascinating that in our education system<br>we probably spend about three years of<br>history learning about British history<br>and Britain's history curriculum doesn't<br>spend a page Ireland so it's<br>understandable that people are like what<br>are you going on about because somebody<br>made a decision that doesn't have much<br>about Ireland in the curriculum what are<br>we supposed to do about that how do we<br>find ways morally to tell stories about<br>the past because they will influence the<br>way that the future has the way that the<br>present happens here's another story<br>about power and I was part of a group of<br>gay men well actually I wasn't part of a<br>group of gay men there was there was a<br>group of gay men they used to meet for<br>prayer meetings in Belfast and I used to<br>boycott it because I was like for God's<br>sake there are no places for LGBT people<br>to go for prayer why on earth is this<br>just for gay men so it's boycotting it<br>and presumably they were Davis<br>and then a friend of mine is as many<br>years ago a friend of mine went along<br>and wanted to go along because he had a<br>crush on somebody who was there it was<br>all very exciting and he didn't want to<br>go by himself so he asked would I go<br>along to accompany him and I had a crush<br>on him but I hadn't told them so it was<br>all like a theological love triangle<br>this anyway I went too long to be I'm<br>already supportive nothing ever happened<br>between me and a friend thank God or a<br>good friend still much better and we<br>happen to be at the prayer meeting where<br>they were deciding well we were won't we<br>invite the lesbians to join us and<br>somebody said I've never met a lesbian<br>just anybody no one and I start to take<br>notes because I thought I think this<br>might be an interesting conversation and<br>somebody said I don't know any either<br>what are they like as if you could ask<br>that question and then somebody said I<br>wonder if we could invite one to come<br>and speak to us and I found myself<br>thinking of them if one were to invite<br>like the most important lesbian to come<br>to speak to a group of gay men like to<br>whom would one address the letter what<br>would her title be and like where's the<br>address for the Department of lesbianism<br>so here's a poem called the visit of the<br>Queen of the lesbians to the gay men's<br>project and my friend Gayle did say to<br>me at one point to go to a park of all<br>the names that the chief lesbian would<br>call herself Queen is definitely not one<br>of them I've kept it in there to show my<br>blind spots so the visit of the Queen of<br>the lesbians to the gay men's prayer<br>group when she came to visit she said<br>don't ask me I'm just a driver when she<br>came to visit she said questions reveal<br>much about the secrets of the questioner<br>when she came to visit she said ask a<br>better question Lance<br>she said misogyny is no respecter of<br>homo and row centric little world winds<br>when she came to visit she said just<br>because you don't want to screw us<br>doesn't mean you don't screw us so don't<br>ask me to visit you answer your own<br>queries queries when she came to visit<br>she said cook for us instead that's what<br>people like that one people like her I<br>like her um I suppose I say that because<br>I think it's important for people to<br>recognize that um<br>groups of people like the the man in<br>that group were a good man who had<br>suffered terribly lots of people well<br>know when I got there I realized why it<br>was booked for four men most of them<br>were older men from very rural areas<br>with an enormous amount to lose if<br>anybody knew there was an extraordinary<br>place of prayer and faith and<br>reconciliation floundered monastery in<br>West Belfast that hosted that group for<br>years made it very safe absolute<br>discreet so I totally understood most of<br>the men coming there that come once a<br>month some would drive over hundred<br>miles to get there yeah i 100%<br>understand the need for safety and i<br>100% understand the need to go just<br>because you're in that kind of<br>circumstance<br>it does not indemnify you from the<br>possibility of being ignorant about<br>another group of people upon whom you<br>can also faced the very same thing<br>that's being foisted on you unless<br>you're careful that's telling the truth<br>one of the things as we look to the<br>present that we try to think about us<br>how do we name what's going on how do we<br>say well look here's the reality about<br>what's going on as we think about this<br>telling the truth about power sometimes<br>mean means to say well look I'm just<br>calling this for what it is I can't say<br>why it is or whether it's gonna go away<br>well so how it's gonna change but I just<br>want to name this and I live in a<br>jurisdiction that is in the problem of<br>naming what do you call the jurisdiction<br>where Belfast is you know and sometimes<br>I've been parts of parts of group of<br>people and they've said oh it's just<br>great to be here in the UK I'm like<br>alright and that over there and then all<br>the people were going yeah absolutely<br>right and when I say you know what's<br>brilliant welcome to Ireland to people<br>like that's over the border and when I<br>am from Cork in the very south coast<br>somewhat I moved to Belfast I thought<br>I'm moving a city like not moving<br>country and I'm not a foreigner but some<br>people were very clear to say to me oh<br>you most definitely are a foreigner and<br>we won't use your name<br>calling you Podrick we'll call you<br>Patrick because that's what we'll call<br>you and there's possibly no better way<br>to insult an Irish speaker and a person<br>with an Irish language name than just<br>deliberately anglicize it if you know<br>the difference obviously if you don't<br>know the difference is just an<br>understandable mistake but if you know<br>the difference to deliberately amplify<br>surname is a little echo of linguistic<br>colonization as I'm sure you can<br>understand and there's questions over<br>the last few years regarding brexit<br>about well will this feel of a process<br>of a new Ireland we were the border be<br>changed somehow we have a referendum at<br>some point and this is a serious<br>question one that I've been really<br>interested in and thank God the rules of<br>the Republic of Ireland it'll have to be<br>a cross-border jury referendum obviously<br>the rules of the Republic of Ireland<br>unlike the British ones we have rules<br>about referenda in the Republic of<br>Ireland so if there is a referendum<br>policies will have to be decided in<br>advance rather than made up out of there<br>afterwards<br>that's simply a difference in in part in<br>what support constitutional and set up<br>and Britain has the most extraordinary<br>and envied and brilliant parliamentary<br>process overwhelming they should have<br>used it for asking the questions they<br>didn't they used referenda for which<br>they don't have a set up this is a<br>referendum isn't written into the<br>Constitution that's famously unwritten<br>and that's part of the problem so if<br>there is a vote on a united Ireland<br>it'll have to be a serious prepared for<br>an advanced one because it will have to<br>pass the Irish laws but the question for<br>me clear enough as I am about how I'd<br>feel about it the question for me is<br>would anyone die as we try to decide<br>staying part of the UK becoming part of<br>a new federal Ireland will anyone be<br>kneecapped now you want to be injured<br>how many is enough too much too few so<br>here's the poem designed to irritate<br>everybody it's called the northern of<br>Ireland because some people call it in<br>Northern Ireland some people call it the<br>north and so this is not a proposal of a<br>the northern of Ireland it is both a<br>dignity and a difficulty to live between<br>these names perceiving politics and the<br>syntax of the state and at the end of<br>the day the reality is that whether we<br>change or whether we stay the same these<br>questions will remain who are we to be<br>with one another and how are we to be<br>with one another and what to do with all<br>those memories of all those funerals and<br>what about those present whose past was<br>blasted far beyond their future I wake<br>you wake she wakes he wakes they wake we<br>wake and take this troubled beauty<br>forward part of the complication about<br>trying to speed you know to tell stories<br>about power in the present is that it<br>takes all kinds of safety and for many<br>years Karim Allah has I'll tell you a<br>little bit more about corrymeela and<br>later on but Cora Mila has brought<br>people together from different<br>experiences of victimhood different<br>experiences of pain different<br>experiences to being recruited into<br>paramilitary organizations at a very<br>young age I think had anybody come to me<br>when I was 13 and kind of told me<br>stories that you know got my adrenaline<br>and testosterone going I think I would<br>win until I should join a group of<br>people that said they wanted me and then<br>presumably at the age of 17 when some of<br>those groups would say well the only way<br>you can stay on past the age of 17 is if<br>you murder somebody I don't know that I<br>did on any different to many people I<br>think I might have stayed who am I to<br>say that I'd have been any different and<br>it can be very difficult to bring people<br>together and but that's what's really<br>needed so but two short poems here about<br>that process I've worked for years and<br>bringing groups of people together to<br>talk about this talk about experiences<br>of victimhood experiences of being shot<br>at being bereaved being almost shot at<br>surviving when your friends didn't being<br>recruited leaving not leaving being<br>imprisoned getting amnesty not getting<br>amnesty peace processes like the one we<br>had in 1998 or a peace agreement is the<br>beginning of something and what we need<br>to recognize is that conflict theory<br>says that a conflict takes as long to<br>de-escalate as<br>to escalate and a very modest rating of<br>the the pain of british-irish relations<br>is 1921 at partition to 1998 so you know<br>but said 80 years roughly and so really<br>the best time to ask the question about<br>whether the Irish peace process British<br>Irish peace process has achieved much<br>would be in around<br>um 2070 or 20s late 2070 and I think<br>that's a really worthwhile thing to<br>recognize and I wish governments were<br>good at saying yeah we're in the long AG<br>your stretch of this process of<br>reparation of peace of negotiation of<br>ongoing commissions and engagement and<br>each successive government will improve<br>a little bit please God on the previous<br>ones some of them will critique each<br>other but if we think that word that<br>that's the Longacre we're stuck for that<br>wouldn't be a bad thing<br>relevant or we had that before we even<br>had a commemorative plaque put up so<br>community groups are a lot better at<br>recognizing how long it'll take here's<br>two poems called in the beginning in the<br>beginning the people lived in darkness<br>and the darkness overcame them in the<br>beginning<br>the people lived in darkness and the<br>darkness overcame them for a while the<br>people learn to cope so they spoke<br>little of the things that they'd hoped<br>for they learned to escape so they took<br>breathing breaks in the bathroom the<br>people lived in the here and now<br>they stayed here and now in corners<br>previously on found in - up - down<br>houses the people learn to walk the<br>people stood and they survived that<br>people learn to live without the lives<br>that have been taken their only choice<br>was that they stand and so they stood<br>shaken the people chose their crutches<br>carefully carved and chosen they did a<br>drink a bit of soap TV a weekly visit to<br>a friend's house four cups of tea and<br>paracetamol the people's throats were<br>choked with lives that are not living<br>and the thing about it is that they have<br>coped with things that they should not<br>be roped with the people are victorious<br>they can look you in the eye and size<br>you up there hold on life is loose and<br>their embrace is tight the people stood<br>in darkness and in it they became their<br>light my poem is written as part of a<br>process working with them corrymeela<br>when I was poet in residence there with<br>a woman Susan McCune who curated<br>extraordinary programs being in people<br>together from across Belfast and part of<br>my job was to write a poem based on the<br>conversation that people had and this<br>was a kind of pour at the end of a long<br>process and I come back the week after<br>and say here's the poem I wrote to<br>reflect on last week what do you think<br>of it and I was edited by people some of<br>whom were saying oh I've never read a<br>poem you know in the last 20 years but<br>the whole point was that it was people<br>who were looking for an echo of their<br>experience some of the edits were great<br>at one point I read out a poem after a<br>really tough week when people have been<br>saying<br>implicated painful things and a read<br>upon that I'd written and I said how<br>does that seem does it sit right and a<br>magnificent woman said it doesn't say<br> off so that's a great critique<br>so I ammend at the point I won't be<br>reading it to you as we think of the<br>future when it comes to thinking of<br>stories of trouble and peace and<br>thinking I'm telling the truth to power<br>I suppose this something I want to say<br>is that I don't necessarily believe in<br>the future and I hear people say<br>regularly oh you know the future is in<br>the hands of our children and I think<br>that is one of the most profound<br>applications of responsibility<br>accountability and power that people are<br>allowed to get away with it sounds<br>really poetic but I think if you're in a<br>situation in public where you're saying<br>that I just think you're letting<br>yourself off the hook I think we need to<br>find ways to say I'm working and I'm<br>doing courageous things that I haven't<br>tried before to see whether that will<br>work to see whether whatever future our<br>children have is actually already made<br>different by something that people with<br>power and influence and can use right<br>now and I think there's something<br>important to recognize that the future<br>doesn't exist yet the past barely exists<br>all that exists is the moment of courage<br>and the moment when you might go<br>everything in me wants to respond in a<br>predictable way however I'm going to try<br>to respond in a way that's surprising<br>where the argument on the radio won't be<br>the predictable dialogue that everybody<br>could write down in advance where<br>instead we're going to say something new<br>something is unexpected and our debating<br>partner will go I don't have a rebuttal<br>to that because you've just said<br>something kind to me thank you<br>and then we can begin to think what does<br>serious public disagreement look like<br>instead of the performance of a silly<br>public disagreement look like so here's<br>a few poems about the future<br>and where is this I'm the first one is<br>called go to hell but it's gentler than<br>its title and no it's not it's not in<br>here I'll read that in the next session<br>cuz I've left it behind the second one<br>I'll tell you why I wanted to talk about<br>Hell though because I think one of the<br>things that we need to do in public<br>moments is to name the hell's that we've<br>created and the hell's the perhaps we've<br>been responsible for this is where the<br>study of theology has been so helpful to<br>me um I did a vatican undergrad and it<br>was a Pontifical whatever in theology<br>divinity and I found myself overwhelmed<br>and deeply deeply interested in the<br>question of Hell Oh actually all my life<br>in poetry through Dante's Inferno as<br>well as in questions to a theology as a<br>gay man I felt told that I was going to<br>be going there so I suppose I felt the<br>need to do a little bit of em Advanced<br>Research the Lonely Planet's guide to<br>hell and I found out some really<br>interesting things when I began to read<br>about it the idea is that in Judaism<br>really there isn't an understanding of<br>hell or heaven actually the afterlife<br>really came in when the Greeks started<br>to come down and especially then when<br>there had been this hope after hope<br>after Hope dashed by successive empire<br>that came through and took over and the<br>Levant and the and people were thinking<br>when are we going to get some kind of<br>Solace and started oh maybe it'll happen<br>in some afterlife some as the French say<br>Lord Allah the hereafter that over there<br>and then of course people start to think<br>well because the the wicked are dying<br>happy well maybe they're dying happy and<br>then going somewhere pretty terrible and<br>the story of Hell has changed over and<br>over in Catholicism never mind in any<br>other version of Christianity and<br>in many other religions and I found<br>myself looking at em 20th century<br>theology about hell and extraordinarily<br>Benedict Pope Benedict Pope who doesn't<br>like me very much<br>and who I don't like very much although<br>the film the two popes did have fiction<br>as it was he wrote something fascinating<br>about Hell he said and this I think we<br>must always remember his coming from a<br>German who had seen horrific things in<br>his country he said if we as Christians<br>have an understanding that there can<br>occasionally be realized on earth such a<br>thing as the kingdom of heaven we must<br>also recognize that the 20th century<br>alone teaches us that there can also be<br>realized on earth such a thing as a<br>kingdom of hell and if that's the case<br>we must go with our abandoned brother<br>into those places with the courage that<br>he had now that's the theology that I<br>found really interesting and that's a<br>theology that made me go the I have good<br>reason for struggling with Benedict but<br>I also need to be careful not to totally<br>lambaste him because he has changed my<br>mind and given me something that I have<br>held onto for years now as a result of<br>that and in as much as I might disagree<br>with someone I shouldn't try to disagree<br>with them all the time because then I'll<br>miss out something series and we<br>currently have a public platform between<br>friends and between politicians where<br>there is an understanding that if you<br>begin to agree with or have compassion<br>for or so some kind of sympathy other<br>than the most basic kind of sympathy<br>just somebody on the other side of your<br>political or agenda platform well then<br>you're a sellout and perhaps you need to<br>be extradited or exiled from your own<br>community<br>what a limitation of the human project<br>that we have and so that's why I have a<br>poem about Hell that I'm not<br>- yeah cuz I have like oh I found it<br>I wasn't a setup I'll read this when we<br>finish go to hell<br>he is called to hell this man he is<br>called to glory he knows well those<br>twisted ways and those who've lost their<br>story he is called to clay this man he<br>is called<br>to yearning he has heard of hidden<br>streams that heal those tired of burning<br>he's searching out those raised in hell<br>he wants to know the things they know he<br>believes in dreamland where the ragged<br>people go he is called to quiet no he is<br>called to silence<br>squat down on the breaking ground with<br>those who swallowed violence he is<br>called to anguish thoughts he is called<br>to flowers to find in hell's own lonely<br>fury that which no flame devours I saw<br>him on the Midway path I saw he carried<br>two things only on his trip to hell this</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
