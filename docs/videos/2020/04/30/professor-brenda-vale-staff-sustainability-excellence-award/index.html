From designing and building the UK's first 'autonomous house' with her husband in the early 1970s, to the couple publishing a 'real guide to sustainable living' book in 2009 titled Time to eat the dog?</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my interest in sustainability goes right<br>back to when I was an architecture<br>student and the air Paul Ehrlich was<br>talking about population explosion<br>Rachel Carson was talking about the<br>death of the seas and a lot of us<br>students thought well maybe we should be<br>doing something about this when it came<br>to buildings and so hence the idea of<br>designing low energy buildings<br>autonomous buildings buildings related<br>to being self-sufficient so that we were<br>growing your own food but we said we<br>could do with the very first Medical<br>Center we ever did was that we would<br>make it use 80 percent less energy for<br>no extra cost and so we did the first<br>Medical Center of where we got our 80%<br>energy of reduction at no extra cost and<br>then we did maybe a whole series of them<br>five or six other medical centers using<br>the same principles which was just<br>trying to make improve the installation<br>of them and improve control the<br>ventilation of them so so that they used<br>a lot less energy and it was really<br>simple stuff and I think that did help<br>to move the building code in the UK to<br>become more energy efficient it was a<br>kind of global movement and I think it<br>was also done in response to risk the<br>the limits to growth people that think<br>the modeling that came out of MIT that<br>showed that society was if it carried on<br>as it was going would collapse about<br>2050 it really all stopped I suppose<br>with with the sort of economic reforms<br>with people like that coming into power<br>and the whole thing just disintegrated<br>in terms of architecture and<br>architecture moved in a totally<br>different direction what we realized<br>over the years in in doing the low<br>energy buildings the autonomous<br>buildings and the zero energy buildings<br>was it wasn't the building that really<br>mattered it was what people did in them<br>that mattered and when you look at the<br>ecological footprint of a person say in<br>a developed country like the UK you find<br>that the biggest component is the food<br>that you eat and that's followed then by<br>your energy in terms of<br>that domestic energy you abused the low<br>energy buildings come in there I mean my<br>view is that sustainability is as<br>serious as gravity and we wouldn't<br>design a building that was deliberately<br>going to fall down we always respect<br>gravity and we design buildings and we<br>should be doing exactly the same with<br>sustainability</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
