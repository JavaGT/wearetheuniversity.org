font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>but two decades before returning to<br>university I which in New Zealand<br>forests all over New Zealand and what<br>really struck me was how quiet the<br>forests are I was really interested and<br>how our beards are doing and how they're<br>doing a see she after control the main<br>findings from my PhD where that the<br>species that are responding well to no<br>more control appear to be the ones that<br>are really iconic insects it's quite a<br>positive exciting finding that the<br>species we most care about what we most<br>notice in the bush the large species<br>like the New Zealand pigeon macaca even<br>the federal back those ones that are<br>very rare now our doing well with mammal<br>controlling and even do well and and at<br>some level when there's low intensity<br>control<br>conversely there seem to be species that<br>consistently don't respond to no more<br>control and so the reason for this<br>appear to be that deer the smaller sort<br>of less endemic seem more common species<br>like the fantail in the phil brain which<br>may be doing okay with mammals here in<br>new zealand and because they have<br>resilience strategies that have been<br>retained from their their former<br>exposure to mammals on another continent<br>and also that perhaps with the removal<br>of that the larger and deep the endemic<br>species like their the federal bank and<br>the cargo and the Chewie these species<br>are able to expand and do better so my<br>PhD research has important implications<br>for conservation management and so far<br>they're miniatures can understand using<br>thermal control and the intensity that<br>they're using at the site they might be<br>and understand more about what they<br>would expect to get at the end of that<br>control program I think then the next<br>important seats to make following on<br>from the research would be to then not<br>just look at different types of normal<br>control but look at the the residual<br>densities of mammals which means the the<br>bunt the abandoned sort of mammals after<br>the control and what me<br>to see how their success is so that we<br>can then really target our control and<br>we'll find a scale to understand if we<br>drop our rep population down 90% what<br>would we expect to see and the most</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
