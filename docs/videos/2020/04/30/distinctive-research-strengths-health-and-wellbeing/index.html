This is a concept that Maori and Pacific people understand really well<br>and there's a lot to be learned from these communities.<br>Victoria University has health and well-being expertise right across the University<br>including in specialist schools and centres such as the Graduate School of Nursing,<br>Midwifery and Health<br>and the Health Services Research Centre.<br>For example, one current research project<br>looks at the impact of recent health reforms on community pharmacy services.<br>Another, is looking at the early detection of breast<br>cancer through the use of new contrast<br>agents for MRIs.<br>We've got another project looking at a potential drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and<br>there's yet another project looking at<br>the design of outdoor spaces to assist<br>in the rehabilitation of patients.<br>Our research and teaching is being boosted too<br>with the establishment of Victoria's<br>Faculty of Health.<br>The faculty combines our health research expertise, with our traditional strengths<br>in public policy, government and health service delivery, to make a difference to New Zealand's<br>health system and because we're New<br>Zealand's capital City University, we<br>have unique access to government<br>departments and agencies,<br>District Health Boards, NGOs, business<br>science and research groups, and<br>community groups, to make the most of our insights.<br>This is an exciting initiative and we look forward<br>to engaging staff in the teaching and research area of health and well-being.<br>New Zealand's health<br>system underpins all of our lives and<br>there is significant potential to<br>improve the health and well-being of<br>individuals and the well-being of<br>society as a whole.<br>That is because, when we get sick, physically, mentally, emotionally or spiritually, our families<br>and whanau, friends, workmates and all our communities feel the effects as well.<br>Together, we can make a real difference<br>to the lives of all New Zealanders.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
