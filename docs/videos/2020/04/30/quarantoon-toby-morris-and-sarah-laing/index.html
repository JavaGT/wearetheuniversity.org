I think part of<br>what helps me explain it to people that<br>don't understand is that I know I'm the<br>person that doesn't understand when<br>she initially comes to me and says I<br>wanted to, next we have to do something<br>about you know the bubbles or<br>whatever sort of topic that it is that<br>she's wanting to sort of introduce to<br>everybody.<br>We usually Skype and talk about it<br>until I understand.<br>Usually I will just go away and scribble a really rough pencilled version.<br>I'm working digitally but I still think of it as pencils like a really quickly sketched off one.<br>and sometimes if the animation is<br>key to the idea I'll do a rough version<br>of the animation just a blockier version<br>of the animation or something well<br>sometimes I just described to her "and I'm<br>picturing that it will you know this<br>guy's hand will raise up" or whatever it is.<br>Suddenly, my phone went crazy with<br>everybody I know texting me screenshots<br>saying the Prime Minister is holding up your thing<br>And I'll say I'm watching it I'm seeing it too. Yeah that's quite surreal.<br>Like over the years I've had different creative jobs<br>and for a while I worked in advertising<br>and it's not I'm not anti-advertising or you know I think this<br>people are earning a living and that's<br>what you've got to do but for me I felt<br>like I got to a point where it was I'm<br>using all these skills that I have to<br>sell more beer or sell more football<br>boots or like I could use this to<br>talk about important things that you<br>know as well like I feel in a way I<br>guess I feel but it's part of it that I<br>do feel kind of lucky that I have the<br>opportunity to do something to help.<br>And I actually emailed Sharon Murdoch this morning too saying we were emailing about something else<br>but I'm saying to her that I think the cartoons that she's been doing have been, she always does<br>this and now it's sort of equally<br>important now and I'm really conscious<br>of it because it's different to what I'm<br>trying to do this is what we've been<br>trying to do is the real nuts and bolts<br>of how the virus works and how we need<br>to be safe but she's, her comics have all<br>been about the sort of emotional side<br>of what's going on and about warmth and<br>about kindness and about looking after<br>each other<br>I love Sarah's comics too. I've been<br>enjoying those. That's a really important<br>side to it you know this is sort of the<br>personal side to what we're all going<br>through.<br>I think it will be really valuable to look back on those documents<br>Usually I will draw my little diary comic. That would be the first thing that I would do.<br>And that would take me about an hour to an hour and a half to draw my little diary comic.<br>During which time I've drank my pot of coffee.<br>And then of course, the other thing which I'm doing while I'm working with my day job as a graphic designer<br>for a government department.<br>We have a stand up meeting, a zoom stand-up meeting where we put our little headphones on we go around in<br>our respective houses and and tell<br>everybody what we're working on or not<br>working on you know we're kind of we're<br>making attempts to work on it so so yeah<br>so that's that's the other thing which<br>I'm sort of simultaneously doing I'm<br>sort of opening at my work email and you<br>know sending emails and and you know<br>trying to force myself to to refine an<br>info graphic or to lay out a PDF<br>document or something like that.<br>I think it does help me with the lockdown I mean<br>I think what's really important<br>well for me I think it's you know<br>important to structure my day so<br>I've got like tasks that I have to<br>complete and then when I've completed<br>those tasks I have a kind of a sense<br>that you know I've got something done<br>and that my life hasn't slipped away<br>and also I think that's the reason why I<br>think it's useful for me is that it kind of<br>makes me look at the world in a<br>particular way so it kinda makes<br>me look at the world in a humorous way<br>because all this stuff could really get<br>me down.<br>When you are drawing diary<br>comics yeah you do kind of put on your<br>noticing eyes and you begin to listen to<br>what people are saying you begin to see<br>funny things in the world you begin to<br>kind of view little situations as kind<br>of little kind of skits little kind of<br>dramatic moments that you can<br>potentially use so yeah there's<br>definitely definitely a special kind of<br>noticing when you're involved engaged in<br>that project of making diary comics.<br>There are particular comics which you know I've<br>I read and I've particularly you know<br>wanted to, yea aspire to be like them.<br>I mean theres your kind of classic ones that<br>everybody says which was you know Alison<br>Bechdel and Marjane Satrapi, I mean<br>that's a kind of benchmark and and and I<br>you know I always I just completely<br>adore Jillian Tamaki's<br>artwork and I love Eleanor Davis's artwork and and in terms of storytelling<br>you know I think I've already mentioned<br>Gabrielle Bell and you know and again<br>you know I'm Sarah Glidden as well she's<br>you know got beautiful kind of artwork<br>and yeah and and you know there was, there was this amazing<br>German comic who also I think it's generally people who do do the kind of hand-drawn stuff that<br>that I am most drawn to.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
