style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>This video will cover what the volunteer<br>roles are at graduation.<br>Whether your regular volunteer or this is your first time, this should give you an<br>idea of what to expect.<br>As a Banner Carrier, you walk in the<br>parade holding one of the faculty banners.<br>As graduands arrive at the Law<br>School, they will line up behind their faculty banners.<br>There is also a large banner that is carried at the front of the parade.<br>If you're given this job, you will need to find two or three students to carry this.<br>As a Parade Marshal, your job is to space yourselves out and walk<br>alongside the parade.<br>You need to encourage graduates to keep moving in<br>the southbound lane and discourage<br>friends and family members from joining the parade.<br>We encourage students to take photos as they go, but they need to keep<br>moving, particularly if they are at the<br>back of the parade and holding things up.<br>When you first arrive at the Michael Fowler Centre, go to the Frank Taplin room to sign in.<br>Double-check your role and pick up any equipment needed.<br>There is a bag drop in the Lion Harbourview Lounge where you should drop your personal items.<br>Food is available in the Frank Taplin Room before or after your pre-ceremony roles.<br>If your the Reception Lead, you need to<br>collect the reception pack before starting.<br>The pack includes a cellphone<br>loaded with key numbers and named<br>envelopes of tickets to be picked up<br>from the Graduation Office team.<br>Your role is to give out any tickets been<br>collected and to assist with queries<br>from graduates and guests.<br>If anything more complicated comes up, you can call<br>one of the events team or find them in<br>the Renouf Foyer.<br>You'll need to stick around for 15 minutes after the ceremony starts<br>to direct late guests upstairs and bring late students to the Events team.<br>As a Ground Floor Usher, you<br>provide directions and answer questions<br>as people arrive.<br>Graduands need to go to the Renouf Foyer<br>to be marshalled and guests can sit anywhere in the auditorium.<br>Make sure you have a look around before your role starts, so you can<br>point people in the right direction.<br>Lion Harbourview Lounge is where those<br>sitting on stage get ready and are marshalled.<br>Volunteers here will take on one or more roles.<br>If you're on the sign-in desk, you will greet staff as they arrive, tick their names off<br>and give them their marshaling numbers and row leader cards.<br>As a Dresser, you help staff with their academic dress and make sure they are dressed correctly.<br>As a Marshal, you need to stand at your<br>sign to check in graduands as they arrive.<br>You will have a sheet of stickers with<br>graduands names and marshalling numbers on them.<br>As they arrive, give each student their sticker, a programme, and ask them to<br>line up according to their number.<br>When advised by the Events team give your remaining stickers to them to<br>check through who has not checked in.<br>As a Runner, you are part usher and part events assistant.<br>You stand outside of the Renouf Foyer guiding graduands into the foyer<br>and keep guests from entering.<br>If graduates have bags, flowers or any other bulky items let them know<br>they should give them to their guests if<br>possible.<br>You will also need to assist at the events team when required.<br>If you are a Dresser, you will help graduands in the Renouf Foyer<br>with their academic dress.<br>Mostly, this means making sure graduands are wearing their hoods correctly<br>and helping them to pin their hood to their gown where necessary.<br>There are three Lead In Marshals, who are<br>assigned to either door two, three or five.<br>If you are a Lead In Marshal, the Events team will signal you to lead your<br>row out of the Renouf Foyer into your door.<br>Lead your row up to the door and wait.<br>When the conch has played lead your row<br>into the auditorium.<br>Door 5 goes to block 1, door 3 to block 2 and door 2 to block 3.<br>Start from the front row and make sure they go right to the other side.<br>Once one row is full, start on the next.<br>As Seat Filler, you walk in directly behind the Lead In Marshal.<br>You need to stand behind the row of<br>seats that are being filled to make sure<br>no seats are left empty and the graduands stay standing.<br>Once all students are in the block, the<br>Lead In and Seat Filler rolls are<br>complete and you can leave the<br>auditorium.<br>As Feed Out, you sit next to the row of<br>graduands<br>and let them know when to go and line up.<br>When you get to the end of the block, go to the next one to let them know not to<br>get up yet.<br>As a Hooder, you check the hood or stole is sitting correctly and the tassel<br>on the trencher is on the right hand side as graduands line up to go across the stage.<br>If you're the Name Checker,  you will have a folder of the full list of graduands.<br>You check each graduand matches the order on the list before they go across the stage.<br>Stair Stop, means you stand at the bottom of the stairs as the graduates come off the<br>stage and direct them towards the Photo Call.<br>As Photo Call, you make sure graduates stop to have their photo taken<br>with a professional photographer, before directing them to the next volunteer.<br>If you're an Usher, your job is to direct students along the right path<br>either towards the stage or back to their seats.<br>Usher Door 1 stands here, Usher Door 3 here, Usher Door 5 here, and Usher Door 7 here.<br>When your role is not required, such as during the musical interludes,<br>you can sit down in an available seat.<br>As Feed In, you direct graduates back into the row they came out of.<br>There is one Lead Out volunteer for each block of graduates.<br>During the official procession, you should get in place and<br>direct the graduates to leave, when the last of the procession have gone past.<br>Lead Out Door 3, directs graduates out row by row, starting at the back right of block 3.<br>Lead Out Door 5, directs graduates out row by row, starting at the back right of block 2.<br>Lead Out Door 7, directs graduates out row by row, starting at the back right of<br>block 1.<br>We look forward to seeing you at graduation.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
