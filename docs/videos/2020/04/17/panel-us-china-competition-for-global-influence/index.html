I'm<br>Manjeet Singh pardesi the acting<br>director of the Center for Strategic<br>Studies welcome to our panel discussion<br>with three visiting speakers from the<br>National Bureau of Asian Research in<br>Seattle and Washington DC on the<br>us-china strategic competition all three<br>of our speakers are involved with NB<br>a--'s strategic asia program which puts<br>out an excellent publication on<br>geopolitical issues in asia<br>distinguished NBD our speakers include<br>Michael waltz filling in the center the<br>executive vice president of MBA are<br>Michael managers and biast publication<br>program including the strategic Asia<br>series and the Asia policy Journal his<br>research expertise includes geopolitics<br>international security and international<br>relations of Asia with the particular<br>interest in China's relations with<br>Southeast Asia to his right is Allison<br>Solinsky vice president of research<br>Allison's research interests include US<br>policy towards Asia especially us-china<br>relations and great barber competition<br>in the region she's the author of<br>numerous articles and reports on these<br>issues and co-editor of the strategic<br>Asia series and finally we have Ann<br>Marie Murphy professor Seton Hall<br>University and research publications<br>have focused on Indonesian elections<br>foreign policy military strategy<br>socio-political transformation and<br>engagement with the US as well as<br>engagement with East Asian regionalism<br>and the role of Muslim professional<br>associations in Southeast Asian politics<br>let me say by starting let me say by<br>noting that we are absolutely delighted<br>to have such a fantastic panel lined up<br>this evening many thanks to Michael o<br>Shaughnessy from the Americas division<br>at and Pat for facilitating this event<br>also many thanks to Suraj of the CSS<br>administrator for putting this event<br>together<br>including the reception outside<br>afterwards so a panel discussion this<br>evening will focus on the us-china<br>competition for influence in Asia and<br>globally American speakers will talk to<br>us for about 10 minutes or so on their<br>areas of expertise and we will open the<br>floor to questions and discussions<br>afterwards so we will begin with Michael<br>thank you very much for the warm welcome<br>it's a pleasure to be here at the<br>University today we really appreciate<br>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and<br>Trade for helping bring us to wellington<br>and the opportunity to have this<br>discussion here this Manjeet said Ali<br>and I work for NVR the National Bureau<br>of Asian research we're an independent<br>policy research institution a think tank<br>based in both Seattle and Washington DC<br>we're not part of the US government for<br>30 years we've worked with different<br>administration's in different congresses<br>to inform and strengthen policy our<br>mission is to bring the best possible<br>expertise from the academic community to<br>bear on US policy thinking in the hopes<br>that our policymakers will make better<br>informed decisions increasingly we're<br>having conversations across the region<br>too and we focus only on the<br>asia-pacific region and so we have<br>conversations with with policymakers in<br>Tokyo in Seoul and in Taipei<br>this past week we were in Canberra and<br>Sydney and this week we're having some<br>meetings here with government officials<br>in Wellington one distinguishing<br>characteristic of NBR is that we are a a<br>think-tank that works on a network<br>network of experts model we engage<br>thousands of professors from<br>universities around the world and our<br>research projects and in any one year we<br>might have 150 to 200 professors working<br>on NBR research that means we're getting<br>a breadth of opinions and perspectives<br>into our work and we're using those to<br>to inform the US policy community one of<br>our core programs at NVR is the<br>strategic asia program this is an annual<br>assessment of the changing balance of<br>power across the asia-pacific region<br>about geopolitical trends in the region<br>and the last two books that we published<br>in January of 2019 and<br>January of 2020 have been exploring the<br>question of the increasingly tense<br>competition between the United States<br>and China and so what I'm going to do in<br>my remarks is just spend a few minutes<br>describing that from the US perspective<br>and then I'll turn it over to Alison to<br>talk about how the region is responding<br>and then anne-marie will do a deeper<br>dive into Southeast Asia but we look<br>forward to your questions and comments<br>following following our remarks so to<br>begin with I want to talk about China's<br>rise as a story and it's a fascinating<br>one it's one we're all very familiar<br>with and for 40 years it's turned china<br>from a country that was emerging from<br>the chaos of the Cultural Revolution to<br>a great global power and our experts<br>view this rise taking place in three<br>phases the first phase under done<br>shellping is a period of sort of<br>internal consolidation and a focus on<br>growing China's national power dung when<br>he took over in 1978 1979 began China's<br>four modernizations to transform the<br>country from an agrarian economy into an<br>industrial powerhouse and then<br>increasingly into an information-based<br>economy that we see today and this<br>required China to to have a peaceful<br>environment outside its borders in order<br>to focus internally on this task of<br>national rejuvenation done require there<br>to be a peaceful international<br>environment and so the maximum that many<br>of you will be familiar with is sort of<br>high capabilities and by time you know<br>China wanted to to grow its power<br>without causing any problems with the<br>rest of the world this period lasted<br>really until 1991 and so following the<br>end of the Cold War<br>China's environment changed quite<br>dramatically and the new Chinese<br>leadership under gen zoom in and then<br>who Jintao began a more focused effort<br>to increase their economic<br>liberalisation to integrate China into<br>the global economy and this culminated<br>in 2001 with with China's accession into<br>the WTO and during this period Western<br>businesses US businesses were<br>increasingly involved in China this was<br>sort of a win-win<br>period there was a lot of cooperative<br>talk between between the two countries<br>yet at the same time there was some<br>security dilemmas between the United<br>States and China we see this in in 1996<br>during the Taiwan Strait crisis when<br>Taiwanese presidential election China<br>threatened and threatened the island and<br>the US and aircraft carrier battle<br>groups between the the mainland and<br>Taiwan we see it again at the beginning<br>of the George W Bush administration in<br>2001 with the ep-3 incident and both of<br>these I think reflect a Chinese desire<br>even back during the this sort of end of<br>the hide and Bide era to push back<br>against US power China did not feel<br>comfortable with a strong United States<br>operating right around its periphery and<br>so Beijing was looking for ways to kind<br>of push US forces in US presence further<br>away from its shores and have more of a<br>buffer zone around it and then the third<br>phase really begins in 2008 and this is<br>following the great global financial<br>crisis the recession that hit hit the<br>United States and it hit Europe and this<br>was seen as an opportunity by by huge in<br>town that the Chinese administration at<br>that point as a sign that the Western<br>model of a sort of free market<br>liberalized globalized economic and<br>political system was beginning to fail<br>the fact that the West was not able to<br>respond quickly to this crisis and the<br>fact that China was sort of able to<br>sidestep it led to I think decisions in<br>Beijing or conclusions in Beijing that<br>this was China's time and that now was<br>the the opportunity for China to really<br>assert itself as a great power on the<br>world stage we see this markedly begin<br>after 2012 although the antecedents<br>proceeded she didn't thing once he took<br>power and really began to consolidate<br>the power of the party state the<br>anti-corruption campaign sidelined a lot<br>of internal rivals and we moved toward a<br>Chinese system that looked much more<br>like the Mao era where power was<br>consolidated in the hands of one man as<br>opposed to the more technical<br>technocratic leadership that we'd seen<br>during the previous Chinese presidents<br>in 2013 China begins the belt and road<br>initiative with much fanfare and sort a<br>very ambitious plan to connect China<br>globally through Central Asia through<br>South and Southeast Asia across the<br>Indian Ocean through the Middle East<br>into Eastern Europe and increasingly in<br>in the region that New Zealand's<br>concerned about through Southeast Asia<br>and into the Pacific island states and<br>in some cases us analysts would even<br>eurydice's hitting the western<br>hemisphere with Chinese investments in<br>Central and South America in 2014 she I<br>think makes an even bolder move which is<br>a speech in which she launches what what<br>we call the Asian security concept this<br>is the idea that according to XI that<br>angel security affair should be handled<br>by and managed by Asians alone without<br>outside interference and the implication<br>is that the u.s. is the big outside<br>power is the one that really should step<br>back from the region and accompany all<br>of this is a fairly dramatic military<br>modernization program and the People's<br>Liberation Army has transformed<br>enormously over this 40-year period and<br>in recently under Xi Jinping has<br>restructured itself to be more outward<br>oriented so instead of seven military<br>regions I think we went from seven<br>military regions which were defensive<br>within China's territory to five<br>military theater commands where China<br>was beginning to think from a military<br>perspective in similar ways to the<br>United States military where you're<br>looking at joint operations between the<br>services both defensive but also the<br>ability to operate in regions around<br>China including maritime areas far<br>beyond China Shores and so the first<br>thing I'd leave you with is that there's<br>been this this long rise of Chinese<br>power that is increasingly affecting the<br>region and the world the international<br>system more broadly the second point I'd<br>make is just to dig into into the<br>regional ambitions of China a little bit<br>and I'll focus briefly on on both<br>Northeast Asia and very briefly on<br>Southeast Asia but Ann Marie<br>focus on that in her remarks and what we<br>see really here is sort of two elements<br>of Chinese ambitions China's been trying<br>on the one hand to weaken us security<br>alliances around the region and so<br>putting pressure on allies like Japan on<br>South Korea on Taiwan on Taiwan is not<br>an ally but it's a security partner of<br>the United States to be more is more<br>differential to China's interests and<br>less willing to support us security<br>really this is trying to kind of pull<br>allies out of the u.s. orbit and into<br>more of a Chinese orbit in economic<br>terms the the trend that's happened over<br>this decades-long period is that China's<br>trade ties with many countries in the<br>region and China's investment links with<br>many countries in the region of grow<br>significantly in Beijing has been quite<br>willing to use that leverage to to<br>pursue its interests and so we see this<br>for example in South Korea so when South<br>Korea's government decided to to deploy<br>or let the u.s. deploy THAAD missile<br>defense systems in South Korean<br>territory China dissuaded Chinese<br>tourists from traveling to South Korea<br>in large numbers which had fairly<br>significant effects on South Korea's<br>economy and so we're beginning to see<br>China with its its newfound power exert<br>that leverage in order to get the<br>outcomes that it wants to see across the<br>region in Taiwan it's even more extreme<br>China has a goal to reunify and to bring<br>the island into into Chinese territory<br>and so for many years now China has<br>pursued a strategy of very strong<br>diplomatic isolation against Taiwan<br>closing down Taiwan's diplomatic space<br>and enrolled in international<br>organizations peeling away the few<br>countries that still recognize Taiwan<br>and then encouraging them to transfer<br>their allegiance to Beijing and bought<br>recently drastically increasing Chinese<br>influence operations with into my Winnie<br>society and within Taiwanese politics<br>and so this was a very real concern<br>for both of the last two presidential<br>election cycles cycles in the island and<br>China has set a goal Xi Jinping has set<br>a goal that really by 2049 the hundredth<br>anniversary of the founding of the<br>People's Republic China will have<br>emerged as a great global power the<br>unstated implication is that<br>reunification will have happened by that<br>point and so there's a narrowing window<br>where Beijing has really increased the<br>pressure on Taiwan we see very similar<br>trends playing out beyond Northeast Asia<br>through South Asia through Southeast<br>Asia through Central Asia most markedly<br>I think in Southeast Asia I'll just make<br>one remark there and that's the<br>militarization of the South China Sea<br>the building of islands across the South<br>China Sea a very aggressive territorial<br>claims that are challenged the claims of<br>countries in that region and essentially<br>an attempt to weaken as the ann's<br>responds by building very strong<br>relationships with a few ASEAN countries<br>to prevent the organization from<br>fulfilling what it's traditionally done<br>which is collective responses to<br>problems and so if we think about<br>China's rise and we think about China's<br>ambitions in its region the certain<br>final thing I want to leave you with is<br>then how does this look from the<br>perspective of the United States which<br>has been for 60 to 70 years now the<br>regional security guarantor in in the<br>region and United States use China's<br>behavior as fairly threatening because<br>China is really working against the<br>interests of US allies and putting<br>pressure on them and the u.s. as an ally<br>Alliance partner feels the need to<br>respond to that but China's behavior is<br>also affecting US national interests<br>directly the United States has not been<br>an Asian power purely since 1945 I mean<br>it had ambitions in the region going<br>back a century or more and so from the<br>perspective of US policy makers and US<br>national security managers China's<br>behavior in recent years has been seen<br>as quite threatening and it's prompting<br>responses and you see this obviously<br>under the trump administration with a<br>much harsher tone of red<br>toward China national security<br>strategies that talk about the return of<br>great power competition in the region<br>and what I finished my rwan my remarks<br>on it is is the point that this is not<br>just a US government response there are<br>three additional trends within America<br>that have led the the u.s. towards this<br>more competitive posture the first is a<br>trend within the business community for<br>most of the 1990s<br>US businesses were lobbying for WTO<br>accession because they saw the<br>commercial opportunities that engagement<br>with China would afford post WTO<br>accession in 2001 again US businesses<br>were strong champions of a positive<br>relationship with China but if you look<br>back over the last five six seven years<br>the annual surveys that the American<br>Chamber of Commerce runs in China have<br>shown decreasing business confidence in<br>China partly because of increased<br>restrictions that the Chinese government<br>has put on foreign businesses operating<br>in China partly it's because of<br>aggressive Chinese behavior in terms of<br>IP theft and other issues that have<br>damaged the ability for US companies to<br>continue to pursue their goals and so<br>there's been a process in the last few<br>years where it varies company by company<br>and sector by sector but that broad<br>support from the business community for<br>a strong and cooperative relationship<br>with China has been declining the second<br>trend is a wider one within the US<br>population<br>post financial crisis since 2008 and the<br>Trump campaign was able in 2016 to<br>really leverage this and sort of use it<br>to secure power in the election so many<br>parts of the US population felt that<br>they have lost out during the financial<br>crisis and that globalization as a whole<br>had not been a benefit for them you know<br>there were industries in decline<br>China was seen as as the reason for this<br>in many ways and the Trump campaign very<br>skillfully linked this discontent with<br>globalization and economic<br>liberalisation with the rise of China<br>and so this second trend I think has led<br>to a hardening of popular attitudes<br>toward China<br>and then more recently in the last<br>couple of years we've seen a series of<br>Chinese actions in Hong Kong in Xinjiang<br>that have led to an increased concern<br>amongst parts of the US public and the<br>human rights community that China's<br>behavior is really not acceptable it's<br>it's counter to to international norms<br>and so these three things are leading to<br>to sort of reinforce this idea of the<br>fact that we're now in a more<br>competitive relationship and so I'll<br>conclude my remarks by just noting that<br>our analysts both from the strategic<br>asia program and other MVR projects feel<br>that this is a competition that is it's<br>going to be enduring this is not<br>something that will just be during the<br>Trump administration and it will somehow<br>spring back to it so the situation pre<br>2016 following a new administration<br>coming in whether that's later this year<br>or four years from now but there are<br>deep structural reasons why the United<br>States and China are entering a more<br>competitive relationship and that<br>competition will did really define and<br>determine the course of international<br>great thanks Michael has teed me up<br>wonderfully um as the first few lines of<br>my remarks what I want to share pretty<br>much echo what he concluded with and<br>that is that the strategic drivers<br>behind Chinese policy and US policy that<br>our influencing decision-makers are very<br>deeply rooted and I'm sure some of you<br>may have followed earlier this year the<br>US and China signed a phase 1 trade deal<br>that many people were looking to as a<br>sign that perhaps the intensity of the<br>competition would reduce or things would<br>maybe revert to status quo but I think<br>what Michael has kind of shared here<br>should illustrate that that this is<br>especially within the US policy<br>community but also within China<br>culmination of decades-long<br>intensification in bilateral relations<br>where we've seen intensification on a<br>range of issues from trade ongoing trade<br>war to contested interpretations of the<br>Belton road initiative and other Chinese<br>activities as Michael noted that<br>suggests a desire to change the<br>international order so he's talked a<br>little bit about the US and China but<br>it's also critical to take a look at<br>other states states both in the region<br>and around the globe who are realizing<br>and responding to the reality that the<br>us-china competition will define the<br>international system in the decades to<br>come over the past few years many<br>countries have been grappling with the<br>short-term immediate impacts of us-china<br>competition much of this has been felt<br>in the us-china trade war as supply<br>chains are shifting and some countries<br>have to make decisions regarding<br>deployment of 5g networks but<br>simultaneously the long-term and<br>multi-dimensional nature of the<br>competition has become more apparent and<br>unavoidable as it does countries and<br>regions are attempting to respond<br>falling along what I see is a spectrum<br>of responses on one end of that spectrum<br>you have states that are seeking to just<br>avoid negative impacts that might result<br>from this competition and in the middle<br>you have some states that are<br>positioning themselves between the two<br>powers to protect their own interests<br>and then of course at the other extreme<br>there are some nations that seek to are<br>looking to exploit the competition to<br>advance their own interests and see<br>advantages to be had within the<br>competition so if we look Gina<br>graphically closest to the competition<br>itself of course the indo-pacific region<br>bears the brunt the region is<br>confronting an old but increasingly<br>high-stakes dilemma and one that will be<br>familiar to you<br>all states are geographically stuck with<br>China and they're economically<br>interdependent on Chinese markets but<br>most of them are reliant on us power for<br>security and regional stability of the<br>states in the indo-pacific some<br>including those such as japan taiwan<br>india and australia share US strategic<br>interests in checking chinese expanding<br>regional influence but they are<br>simultaneously navigating the economic<br>ties with china amid concerns over us<br>reliability so of these states I'll just<br>pick on Japan for a second as an example<br>because it stands as one of the states<br>that's most closely aligned with US<br>objectives towards China Japanese<br>policymakers welcomed the fact that the<br>United States now takes China's rise<br>seriously as a strategic challenge<br>they've responded by beefing up their<br>own military capabilities more<br>resolutely resisting Chinese claims over<br>disputed island territories tightening<br>their security cooperation with the<br>United States strengthening partnerships<br>in other regional with other regional<br>powers such as India and Australia<br>offering various Indo Pacific nations<br>alternate possibilities to China's Bri<br>investments and even diversifying<br>Japanese economic investments away from<br>China to the degree possible but despite<br>that Japan cannot pursue any<br>comprehensive economic decoupling from<br>China instead its sought to limit<br>tensions at a time of increased concerns<br>about u.s. reliability and pressures<br>from the Trump administration for<br>greater burden sharing and more trade<br>concessions meanwhile other countries in<br>the region such as Central Asia and the<br>Pacific Islands face a different set of<br>challenges they share less of an<br>interest in countering Chinese influence<br>and instead seek to take advantage of<br>benefits to their own interests of<br>increasing attention<br>by the two major powers in the Pacific<br>Islands many states have sought to<br>thread the needle on engaging with the<br>United States Australia New Zealand on<br>the one hand and China on the other<br>finding opportunities to benefit from<br>development and capacity building that<br>both groups are offering with the<br>increased attention the Pacific Island<br>countries have looked for ways to<br>further their own national interests and<br>their own narratives on non-traditional<br>security issues including combating<br>climate change they forcefully grounded<br>their own non-traditional security<br>agenda through the blue Pacific<br>narrative and the Boyd declaration as a<br>direct push back against the<br>geopolitical agenda of these<br>metropolitan powers so that's the new<br>Pacific region but the competition has<br>effects and it reaches well beyond the<br>region itself Russia the post-soviet<br>States Canada Mexico Latin America and<br>South America nations throughout Europe<br>are all being shaped by and responding<br>to the reverberations of the rivalry<br>although they are all driven by<br>different interests and variables like<br>the countries in the indo-pacific<br>responses to the competition are arrayed<br>along a spectrum from those that view<br>the competition as an opportunity to<br>those who are primarily focused on<br>avoiding becoming inadvertent victims<br>Russia is one that seeks to exploit the<br>us-china competition to gain advantages<br>in its own rivalry with the United<br>States Moscow hopes the u.s. competition<br>with China will distract the United<br>States from countering Russian<br>objectives in Central Asia and weaken<br>its primary geopolitical rival more than<br>any other state Russia has increased its<br>cooperation with China on all fronts<br>conducting joint military exercises<br>increasing political cooperation and<br>coordinating to establish norms in<br>international organizations in a<br>different way though parts of Eastern<br>Europe are also looking to gain some<br>benefits from the sino us rivalry by<br>leveraging the attention that China and<br>the United<br>dates are paying them as smaller states<br>they remain cautious about the potential<br>to become a target caught between the<br>two powers but they don't want to miss<br>an opportunity for significant<br>development countries like Ukraine and<br>Georgia while aware that their best<br>defense against Russian incursion is a<br>security relationship with the United<br>States secret potential in the economic<br>promise of Chinese investment meanwhile<br>nations in Western Europe and North<br>America are facing pressure from the<br>United States to support US policy<br>positions on issues such as hallway<br>while balancing the economic and<br>political political cost of doing so in<br>the United States own hemisphere<br>neighbours Canada and Mexico have both<br>found themselves in a difficult position<br>over the past few years Canada continues<br>to deal with deal with diplomatic and<br>economic blowback from arresting Huawei<br>chief financial financial officer among<br>Wong Joe under its extradition treaty<br>with the United States while Mexico<br>faces challenging headwinds in its<br>automobile and transportation sectors in<br>the aftermath of the passage of the u.s.<br>Mexico Canada free trade agreement so<br>out of all these examples there are two<br>broad messages that are true ring true<br>for all states across the indo-pacific<br>outside of the region globally states<br>that are close US allies as well as more<br>distant partners the first is that all<br>of these states are navigating the<br>challenges of economic interdependence<br>they're looking for ways to maximize<br>their security interests without<br>sacrificing their economic relationship<br>with China and this goes is true even<br>for the United States as the u.s.<br>continues to develop the contours of its<br>strategy towards China in an era of<br>increasing competition the United States<br>is still trying to figure out how itself<br>navigates this world of economic<br>interdependence and the second message<br>that all states want the United States<br>to a certain degree China to here is<br>don't make us choose if the u.s. is to<br>be successful and that's the perspective<br>that we often come from at NPR it should<br>not force a choice between the u.s. or<br>China it should instead help empower<br>States politically to deal with<br>Beijing's increasing influence across<br>the region and across the globe<br>so I'll leave it's here and turn it over<br>to my colleague Ann Marie to go a little<br>bit further into the case for Southeast<br>Asia well thank you very much Ally and<br>thank all of you for coming out so what<br>I want to do today is just briefly talk<br>about how sunny US competition is<br>perceived in Southeast Asia I see a lot<br>of students here so if you've read your<br>IR literature you will know that for<br>small and medium-sized states like those<br>in Southeast Asia the most benign<br>international environment is one of<br>great power equilibrium right a rough<br>balance of power because that creates<br>opportunities for small and medium<br>powers to secure economic and political<br>benefits from all sides<br>in contrast the most dangerous<br>international environment for small and<br>medium States is one of zero-sum<br>competition because it forces States as<br>Ally notes to choose sides this is the<br>environment that Southeast Asian<br>countries faced in the Cold War the<br>Vietnam War which many of them remember<br>as a particularly dangerous and costly<br>time for them and it's the way in which<br>they increasingly perceive sino-american<br>rivalry no Southeast Asian state wants<br>to face a binary choice between<br>Washington or Beijing but increasingly<br>they believe that they do so what I want<br>to do since Michael laid out very<br>clearly kind of China's rise I just want<br>to say a few words about what Southeast<br>Asia wants and then focus a bit<br>on how it has perceived changes in US<br>policy over time so from the perspective<br>of Southeast Asia what do they want from<br>China they want economic opportunities<br>and they wanted to see a peaceful rise<br>and they got this until about a decade<br>ago as Michael noted right the Chinese<br>economy grew creating opportunities for<br>trade and investment they saw China<br>become an international aid supporter<br>during the Asian financial crisis when<br>it joined I am at bailouts of Southeast<br>Asian countries for the first time in<br>2008 as Michael noted the Chinese<br>economy really pulled the global economy<br>in particularly Southeast Asian<br>countries out of the crisis China very<br>eagerly joined us and based architecture<br>joining the EAS the East Asian economic<br>summit etc and that gave rise and hopes<br>among Southeast Asian countries that<br>they could have met China in ASEAN based<br>organizations and convinced China that<br>it was in its interest to rise<br>peacefully and to abide by Asya norms of<br>the peaceful settlement of disputes<br>non-interference and domestic affairs<br>and life would go on happily and then<br>about a decade ago in 2009 we see China<br>take a series of steps that indicated<br>that it was as Michael noted willing to<br>abandon skinned dove bide your time hide<br>her strength policy of don't shout ping<br>2009 as you all know China unveils its<br>nine - line map which claims 90 percent<br>of the South China Sea and causes<br>territorial disputes with Vietnam Brunei<br>Malaysia the Philippines etc 2012 it<br>used military force to see Scarborough<br>Shoal from the Philippines 2014 places<br>an oil rig in waters disputed with<br>Vietnam that lie well within Viet Nam's<br>E's<br>see and it engaged in physical clashes<br>to protect that China failed to<br>participate in and abide by the 2016<br>ruling by the permanent Court of<br>Arbitration of the UN law the see which<br>ruled on behalf of a claim brought by<br>the Philippines that China's 9 - line<br>map was inconsistent with enclose and<br>therefore illegal and then as we've<br>heard China built and then militarized a<br>whole series of islands in the South<br>China Sea which have now given it power<br>projection capability much closer to<br>Southeast Asia so in short we see a huge<br>increase in threat on the part of China<br>over the course decade of the last<br>decade so if we now turn to the US we<br>see that the fundamental concern of the<br>part of Southeast Asian states since the<br>Vietnam War has been of US commitment to<br>the region and if we look at Obama's<br>pivot or rebalance to Asia which was<br>announced in 2011 we see that this<br>policy was designed to enhance<br>confidence among many countries but<br>particularly Southeast Asians that the<br>US was a reliable security partner and<br>the pivot was multifaceted faceted<br>excuse me<br>designed to address another concern<br>about among Southeast Asian countries<br>which is that he was policy towards the<br>region tends to focus on security at the<br>expense of economics which of course are<br>vitally important to the developing<br>countries of the region so guess the<br>pivot had a security component of moving<br>sixty percent of the Navy over of<br>enhancing alliances and partnerships but<br>it also had an economic component the<br>TPP a very high-quality free trade<br>agreement and it had a multilateral<br>opponent the US under Obama embraced us<br>and led architecture it signs the Treaty<br>of Amity and cooperation in 2012 sorry<br>in 2012 it joined the East Asian summit<br>the u.s. was the first country to<br>appoint a resident ambassador to ASEAN<br>and Obama backed up his policy with the<br>most precious commodity any president<br>has his time he attended seven of the<br>eight EAS meetings during his tenure in<br>office in the Southeast Asian countries<br>welcomed the u.s. pivot even if they<br>later might not have believed that it<br>lived up to all of its hype because it<br>evidenced a commitment it had an<br>economic component and it demonstrated<br>the u.s. willingness to play its<br>traditional offshore balancing role that<br>gives smaller states greater strategic<br>options so what do we see under trump we<br>see a very transactional america-first<br>policy and economics as you all know he<br>withdraws from the TPP and one of his<br>first acts as president I cannot<br>overstate how much of a blow this was to<br>many economic reformers and countries<br>like Vietnam and Malaysia that had<br>invested significant political capital<br>in generating support for the TPP Trump<br>then as you all know declares a trade<br>war with China which has disrupted<br>global supply chains and lowered growth<br>forecasts in many Southeast Asian<br>countries he's taken a very aggressive<br>unilateral focus on things like deficits<br>and economic access to the US market<br>he's labeled or threatened to label<br>Indonesia a currency manipulator he's<br>withdrawn GSP privileges from Thailand<br>and of course he has<br>abandoned Obama's embrace of ASEAN Trump<br>did attend his first year 2017 sand<br>in 2018 this year sent a very low-level<br>delegation which was viewed as a real<br>slap in the face for ASEAN so we see a<br>backing away from the economic and the<br>multilateral components that were most<br>welcomed in Southeast Asia we then as<br>you know have the Declaration of the<br>free and open Indo Pacific which in<br>Southeast Asia is viewed very much as a<br>kind of reactionary policy on the part<br>of the u.s. to China rather than some<br>product of a long-term strategic<br>assessment right it's a reaction to<br>maritime assertiveness and concerns that<br>the Bri<br>is less a benevolent investment in aid<br>development and infrastructure and more<br>a tool of economic statecraft for<br>security purposes so from the Southeast<br>Asian perspective when they look at<br>these principles in the free and open<br>Indo Pacific they see freedom of<br>coercion as juxtaposed to the Chinese<br>use of force in the South China Sea the<br>emphasis on freedom of navigation in<br>contrast to fears that China will impose<br>an anti access denial strategy they're a<br>rules-based order rather than a might<br>makes right one and a free trade in<br>contrast to kind of predatory economics<br>and debt trap diplomacy that many<br>believe or argue that the US has so on<br>the one hand Southeast Asian states do<br>want some of the principles embodied in<br>the free and open Indo Pacific they want<br>to see a Southeast Asia free of coercion<br>the trade dependent countries in the<br>region do want access to the South China<br>Sea they do want a rules-based order but<br>the Southeast Asian countries have been<br>extremely wary of the free and open Indo<br>Pacific for a number of reasons first as<br>you all know and you've heard from both<br>our speakers now<br>channel security strategy the Trump<br>administration labeled China appear<br>competitor and the 2018 defense strategy<br>said that China's aim was to dislodge<br>the u.s. from the region so in the<br>Southeast Asian perspective the free and<br>open Indo Pacific is a strategy designed<br>to contain China and therefore since it<br>also calls for a building up of<br>alliances and partnerships they view it<br>as something that will further entrap<br>them in great power competition second<br>the free and open Indo Pacific was<br>announced almost simultaneously with the<br>reactivation of the quad which raised<br>concerns in Southeast Asia that regional<br>autonomy would be sacrificed to these<br>great powers and for this reason you see<br>ASEAN feeling compelled to devise its<br>own ASEAN outlook in the Indo Pacific<br>which avoids the word free which China<br>always views as against China and calls<br>for an inclusive Indo Pacific region<br>recognizing that China has a right so I<br>want to flag that ASEAN has been<br>concerned for those reasons they've also<br>been concerned about the free and open<br>Indo Pacific strategy because I don't<br>see it as a strategy they see it as an<br>articulation and division of principles<br>without a concerted set of mechanisms in<br>order to achieve them many Southeast<br>Asian countries believe that the free<br>and open Indo Pacific the key tool or<br>tactic that has been used our freedom of<br>navigation operations or phone apps<br>clearly the primary US interest in<br>Southeast Asia or many would argue in<br>the indo-pacific is freedom of<br>navigation of the region's critical<br>ceilings of communication and the u.s.<br>asserts its right to fly sail and<br>operate wherever international law firm<br>and it challenges will it views as<br>excessive maritime claims through<br>freedom of navigation exercises which of<br>course fly sail and operate through<br>those things so here you see a<br>divergence of interest between the US<br>which wants passage through Southeast<br>Asian waterways in the Southeast Asian<br>interests which is protection of its<br>maritime territory and protection of its<br>right to exploit resources in its Easy's<br>and freedom of navigation exercises do<br>nothing to protect those interests they<br>didn't help the Philippines keep<br>Scarborough Shoal they haven't helped<br>the Vietnamese or others exploit<br>resources okay so as a result of these<br>kinds of perceptions to the Trump<br>administration policy we see if we look<br>at the Institute of Southeast Asian<br>Studies 2020 survey of Southeast Asian<br>leadership's<br>that there is real concern on the part<br>of Southeast Asians with the u.s. so 77<br>percent stated that US engagement with<br>Southeast Asia has declined under the<br>trump administration 52 percent view<br>China as the region's most influential<br>political and strategic actor this<br>compares with only 26 percent for the US<br>and this is a dramatic reversal of only<br>about five six years ago 80 percent view<br>China as the region's most significant<br>economic actor compared to only eight<br>percent for the view for the u.s.<br>Southeast Asian countries are certainly<br>worried about China 85 percent expressed<br>concern that China will be a revisionist<br>after as it continues to rise so that<br>this perception of threat should in<br>theory create space for greater<br>engagement on the part of Southeast Asia<br>with the US however 47 percent of those<br>surveyed indicate little or no<br>evidence in the ability of the u.s. to<br>uphold its commitments to the regions so<br>they lack confidence of the US as a<br>strategic actor and finally when<br>respondents were asked if they had to<br>choose in a hypothetical situation 7<br>Southeast Asian countries chose China<br>only Singapore Vietnam and the<br>Philippines chose the US<br>so in conclusion China appears to be<br>winning the competition for influence<br>within Southeast Asia<br>despite significant worries about<br>China's rise clearly most Southeast<br>Asian states do not want to balance<br>against or bandwagon with China they<br>really want to hedge their bets but the<br>strategic space for them to do so is<br>narrowing so on that note I'll close<br>there I recognize I haven't said very<br>much about individual Southeast Asian<br>countries strategies but I'm certainly<br>happy to do so in Q&amp;A thank you three<br>excellent presentations the floor is now<br>open for questions and discussion may I<br>ask you to identify yourself and the<br>organization that you represent before<br>you ask your questions we have Patricia<br>Mira and Helen with the microphones and<br>please<br>let's want you to imagine as December<br>2020 and you have been working on the<br>briefing books for the US posture<br>strategic posture foreign policy posture<br>in Asia and I want to know what you<br>would say to a president Trump be<br>President Biden see president Sanders is<br>the biggest risk that they need to<br>address thank you I love easy question<br>yeah I mean the first risk well this is<br>an interesting hypothetical I'm gonna<br>Pompey dodge Simon by saying a lot will<br>depend on how the COBIT 19 outbreak<br>unfolds about the state of the global<br>economy at that point I think from the<br>analysis we've done the competition with<br>China is an important one because what<br>the US has represented for 6070 years is<br>one vision of a global order that's been<br>relatively inclusive you know other<br>countries are part of it increasingly<br>you see this when you look at year Japan<br>or South Korea even Indonesia countries<br>that have democratized since 1945 that<br>now see themselves very much as part of<br>that system<br>my biggest fear personally is that the<br>United States steps away from that<br>global leadership role because probably<br>very few of us have lived or experienced<br>a world where the United States did not<br>play that role we know what one of those<br>walls look like and the world of 1920's<br>and 1930's was a period where<br>the global power of the time Great<br>Britain was in decline didn't fully<br>realize it but step back from<br>international leadership the US was not<br>exerting international leadership and<br>you saw during a period of economic<br>dislocation the rise of different<br>political models to try and address that<br>which culminated in a very destructive<br>war I so I think the biggest challenge<br>facing any of the three hypothetical<br>presidents would be to find a way to<br>maintain a u.s. willingness to exercise<br>effective global leadership I would add<br>that interestingly when President Obama<br>briefed incoming President Trump on the<br>issues that would define his presidency<br>and the threats that he needed to most<br>focus on what he warned him for most<br>about was North Korea it was an issue<br>that obviously Obama did not tackle in a<br>way that he might have hoped during his<br>eight years and he fully recognized that<br>he was handing over quite a thorny<br>problem and probably not because<br>President Obama warned him about it but<br>for other various factors some of them<br>self-serving the Trump administration<br>paid attention to North Korea has taken<br>a few stabs at diplomatic efforts but in<br>the end we are no closer to any kind of<br>diplomatic solution on denuclearization<br>of the Korean Peninsula than we were<br>three and a half years ago and so I<br>think that has to still top the list and<br>in fact you know we are even north Korea<br>has had some time in in the interim to<br>continue to develop its its capabilities<br>so we are potentially even you know<br>further dangerous situations that any<br>any of the three will have to address<br>and whether President Trump in a<br>in a second term would have the appetite<br>for it given the failures of his initial<br>attempts at diplomacy is a different<br>question I think good evening I'm Ben I<br>study master of Strategic Studies<br>justfollow firstly thank you for the<br>fantastic event I have a very broad<br>question and that is that we are all<br>aware of the Chinese aggression with the<br>South China Sea and intrusion into the<br>Sea of Japan and there is a lot of<br>evidences that China has been trying to<br>manipulate into the South Pacific so<br>would that be fair to say that the world<br>around China is going towards a more<br>maritime forces or creation of these<br>networks to prevent China targeting all<br>these periphery countries and<br>manipulating them in order to expand its<br>policies and how is that impacting the<br>US policy on China on the Korean and the<br>Iranian aggression in the region I'll<br>make a quick first point so I think that<br>you've raised an interesting point about<br>the importance that maritime domain<br>plays already and will play as we look<br>to hotspots of potential conflict<br>certainly it is an area where both the<br>United States and some of its allies and<br>partners are focusing a lot of<br>collective efforts so in particular<br>you've seen Japan really begun to put<br>more support in capacity building for<br>smaller<br>States maritime defenses which you know<br>has broken from long-standing policy to<br>provide only economic assistance to the<br>region the Japan self-defense forces now<br>regularly tour around the Indo Pacific<br>countries to demonstrate Japanese<br>interests in the region and have<br>increased their own participation and<br>us-led maritime presence operations<br>adding ships to offer asset protection<br>for US aircraft carrier task forces so<br>like-minded think about how you might<br>collectively address such an issue and<br>it's something that I think the u.s.<br>certainly should be encouraged to see<br>and find ways to identify opportunities<br>for its allies and partners to add their<br>capabilities to u.s. capabilities and<br>support I'll come in a little bit on the<br>South China Sea I don't think you're<br>seeing any kind of networked response<br>among the Southeast Asian countries<br>really or with the US and many Southeast<br>Asian countries outside of maritime<br>capacity-building domain awareness etc<br>right if you look at ASEAN has ASEAN<br>come out in strong support of the<br>Philippines or Vietnam those countries<br>that have really suffered the brunt of<br>Chinese assertiveness the answer is no<br>right why not<br>because China is now the number one<br>economic trading partner investment<br>partner and ASEAN is consensus<br>decision-making rules essentially give<br>each member a veto over ASEAN policy<br>that means that countries that China has<br>pretty much bought off right Laos<br>Cambodia have really done China's<br>bidding within the organization to<br>ensure that it does not take strong<br>stances on the South China Sea like<br>Vietnam<br>certainly has one it liked the<br>Philippines under Aquino pressed for so<br>we don't see it in ASEAN he did see a<br>lot of support right for the Philippines<br>taking China to the permanent Court of<br>Arbitration unfortunately that ruling in<br>favor of the Philippines came down in<br>July 2016 just weeks after Duterte was<br>inaugurated and he completely abandoned<br>the plans to use a victory in order to<br>mobilize global support for the ruling<br>and try to compel China which didn't<br>participate in and has you know said it<br>will not abide by it to try to hold it<br>accountable right when there's really no<br>compliance mechanisms in it so in the<br>absence of the Philippines when you have<br>duterte putting it aside that means that<br>it was really hard for other countries<br>to really use that ruling in the way<br>that they had planned so on this out<br>China Sea I think that China's selami<br>strike slicing strategies and coercive<br>and co-opted the statecraft of ASEAN<br>members has really rendered them<br>toothless on the South China Sea I'll<br>give you two more thoughts makes a great<br>question and I think your premise is<br>right I think we are moving into a world<br>where it's going to be more competitive<br>in the maritime space from a strategic<br>level this has always driven us thinking<br>toward the globe actually you know a<br>hundred years ago the u.s. strategists<br>were driven by this idea that the United<br>States would be threatened by the rise<br>of a hostile power that dominated the<br>Eurasian landmass and so one<br>understanding of why the u.s. got<br>involved in World War one by the u.s.<br>one got involved in World War two both<br>in the European theater against Nazi<br>Germany and against nationalist Japan in<br>Asia was to prevent the rise of a<br>hostile power the same thinking was<br>underpinning I think US approaches<br>towards the Soviet Union during the Cold<br>War so yes I think from a strategic<br>level we are moving toward a world of<br>increased need for for maritime power<br>both surface level and subsurface level<br>for air power and surveillance<br>capabilities that will be effective in a<br>maritime domain and increasingly that<br>involves the use of space assets as well<br>there's an interesting technical<br>question that comes into play too and<br>that sort of picks up on what Amrita<br>said about salami slicing in the<br>maritime domain there are very<br>interesting phenomena right now the<br>China is using especially against Japan<br>around the Senkaku Islands where Chinese<br>fishing boats or Chinese Coast Guard<br>militias will move into waters that are<br>contested and so the government of Japan<br>has to figure out well how do we respond<br>to this do we send our Coast Guard to do<br>this but if if the Chinese militia<br>vessels are essentially out gunning the<br>Japanese Coast Guard does Tokyo then<br>decide to send in Japanese maritime Self<br>Defense Forces that's a real escalation<br>perceptually because now you have a navy<br>facing off against non naval vessels but<br>there's not a naval vessels are capable<br>and if they fire on Japan you know the<br>United States has said it will defend<br>its alliance with Japan and that<br>alliance does include Japanese<br>administration of the Saint Harkins and<br>so it's interesting for for governments<br>sort of trying to figure out how to<br>respond to these kinds of tactics when<br>do you deploy your naval assets when do<br>you use your Coast Guard's what's the<br>level of interoperability between those<br>surfaces within your own country let<br>alone an interoperability between those<br>surfaces across an alliance so yeah lots<br>hi Patricia a Sexton MSS candidates it's<br>actually for any of you in the banking<br>world there's a lot of talk about how<br>much the MER how much the u.s. is at<br>mercy at the mercy of China for the<br>exchange rate and the debt imbalance and<br>I'm wondering how how much is how much<br>truth is there to that I know that the<br>maturities of the debt are spread out<br>over a lot which reduces over a lot of<br>years which reduces the risk but how<br>much is America at risk for their debt<br>imbalance and for the exchange rate I'm<br>sorry I'll keep talking less than you<br>might think because both sides would<br>lose enormously you know if China were<br>to to dump you know its securities on<br>the market yes that would hurt the<br>United States but it would also hurt<br>China I think the more interesting thing<br>that we see China doing in the last few<br>years are fairly concerted efforts to<br>diminish the role of the US dollar as<br>sort of the global reserve currency one<br>of the impacts of the belt and road<br>initiative has been to build out a group<br>of countries around China's periphery<br>and then along those Bri investments and<br>establish essentially a trade areas<br>where the renminbi is the currency of<br>choice as opposed to the dollar within<br>you know the worlds of international<br>finance the US overreacted I think to<br>the AIB when when China launched the<br>aviation investment infrastructure bank<br>because many of the US allies and<br>partners decided they were going to<br>become part of it but but there are<br>other moves that the China is promoting<br>within international finance<br>at more technical levels that challenged<br>this this role that the US has enjoyed<br>of being sort of the the architect of<br>the global financial framework and one<br>example would be Beijing's efforts to<br>promote their<br>International payment system as an<br>alternative to the Swift system so when<br>we're all trying to move money's around<br>the world from bank to bank it's Swift<br>is the communication system and the<br>transfer system that banks used to move<br>those funds around China's trying to<br>promote an alternative and the more that<br>that takes root and gives countries<br>options outside the us-led system it<br>limits the ability of the United States<br>to use economic tools to support<br>leverage on adversaries and so it<br>touched your question about Iran earlier<br>but a scenario a decade or so from now<br>might be that it around or fully in this<br>CIPS framework u.s. financial sanctions<br>on Iran would be useless because Iran<br>would have alternatives to a currency<br>into the country and that's a challenge<br>for US policymakers because if you take<br>away the economic tools what are you<br>left with and is that inclining war<br>hello I'm James tow from the Asian New<br>Zealand foundation I've got a question<br>maybe for Emery but also for others on<br>the panel as well a couple of weeks ago<br>president Duterte had stepped away from<br>the visiting forces agreement while<br>Trump sort of shrugged it off and saying<br>oh that's actually a good things it's<br>going to save the u.s. a bit of money<br>for US defense officials those they're<br>saying was a step in the wrong direction<br>so my question is about red lines and<br>what are some of the red lines that<br>might signal to the u.s. that that is<br>losing influence in the region and maybe<br>your thoughts on Huawei and whether<br>there is a red line thank you well I'm<br>sorry interesting question you know it's<br>always so hard with duterte right I mean<br>he says so many things and many of the<br>things he says are contradicted by<br>others in the defense community and<br>particularly in the Philippine Armed<br>Forces right so if you were to survey<br>most of the top military brass they want<br>no changes at all in either the visiting<br>Forces Agreement or the eds agreement or<br>the mutual defense agreement right and<br>although it's the visiting force<br>agreement that you know kind of allows<br>for quick responses particularly of the<br>type that we saw in Mindanao after the<br>Mirai wave riots if he really goes<br>forward a with that or started toying<br>with the two other things those would be<br>even more significant so is that a red<br>line I don't I'm not sure right because<br>many believe that if detect they were to<br>depart the scene you would see a quick<br>reversal of that and I think it's one of<br>the reasons I think that we've seen such<br>a tilt toward China in Southeast Asia<br>except there's really hard to find red<br>lines right<br>you know that's why Chinese the limas<br>slicin was so effective right<br>everything was small nothing was<br>sufficiently important to dictate a<br>stand but cumulative Lee over time China<br>changed the facts on the ground right<br>and here just from the US perspective<br>you know I think it's important to<br>remember that when Xi Jinping was in DC<br>and what 2015 he promised Obama oh we<br>would never militarize those Islands and<br>so when Michael talks about that sea<br>change in DC thinking I think it's hard<br>at least particularly for the folks that<br>get out in Indo PACOM to overestimate<br>how important that was particularly on<br>the maritime side um I'll just say that<br>on highway you see a range of views<br>right so Thailand has a huawei Academy<br>they're pretty much all in Vietnam is<br>certainly imposing it and the fact of<br>the matter is that there's not a really<br>good American alternative right so there<br>was a survey of Southeast Asian leaders<br>on the 5g question and their preferred<br>provider was Samsung okay but that's<br>gonna be more expensive and compatible<br>with certain things so you're gonna see<br>a very disparate response and I will<br>just say one other thing you brought up<br>the Philippines clearly the other formal<br>ally in Southeast Asia is Thailand we<br>see Thailand contracting with China for<br>three submarines in part because they<br>were so much cheaper they could get<br>three for the price of one South Korean<br>submarine and what do we see now that<br>China wants to station a maintenance<br>crew and have the submarines based at<br>sada Heath a critical naval base you<br>must built during the Vietnam War that<br>if you read<br>the 2008 defense strategy it says that<br>access to sada heap is critically<br>important to us power projection<br>capacity and yet if you have Chinese<br>folks military officials at sada heat<br>that is going to have implications for<br>the ability of the US Navy to use it is<br>that a red line not exactly<br>and but it's a real critical juncture<br>alright and so I think that what we need<br>to look at in Southeast Asia u.s. are<br>the series of critical decisions that<br>are path dependent that foreclose future<br>completely concur with Ann Marie's point<br>that red lines are really difficult to<br>identify in this case because it has<br>been a lot of slow-moving difficult to<br>identify as clearly challenging activity<br>on the part of China but your question<br>is interesting from another perspective<br>that it assumes that the United States<br>and in particular the Trump<br>administration cares about losing<br>influence in this specific way I think<br>that in a kind of traditional US<br>presidency you could ask that question<br>with a little more clarity but that the<br>behaviors that Trump has shown to allies<br>and partners in the region have not<br>inspired a lot of confidence that he<br>does really care about these types of<br>responses you know the administration<br>has not shown a lot of distinction in<br>how it differentiates treatment of<br>allies versus treatment of rivals<br>especially when it comes to<br>trade issues and that's certainly a<br>theme that allies and partners have<br>picked up on and are responding to again<br>Duterte maybe a kind of a odd case but<br>there are plenty of others in the region<br>that have expressed similar concerns<br>that you know if we don't understand<br>we're an ally and you're treating us<br>with you know punishing tariffs and<br>really harsh negotiations like you would<br>somebody that you haven't you don't have<br>a security agreement with and so that<br>that itself is causing other frictions<br>in bilateral relationships so I think<br>the question of losing regional<br>influence is a little bit self-inflicted<br>in this case I'm going to take advantage<br>of my position of the chair and ask the<br>next question<br>perhaps over mic make you mention that<br>the US and China are in an enduring<br>competition and some of the other<br>remarks you know about the critical<br>junctures and so on it seems like the US<br>and China are structurally locked in<br>this intense rivalry which will<br>intensify further I was wondering have<br>we gone past the point of no return and<br>can the US and China mutually<br>accommodate each other what might this<br>mutual accommodation look like perhaps<br>it not to end there I will be - at least<br>I think our colleague actually tell us<br>makes this point in in the most recent<br>strategic Asia book the competition was<br>not inevitable but I think as China<br>emerged and began to act like a<br>traditional great power and as the<br>assertion of its interests challenged<br>core US interests we did become walked<br>into into a competitive relationship I<br>don't personally subscribe to the view<br>that there's some kind of<br>in addition to be made that you know<br>that you can't think we're not in a<br>situation like you are in the in the<br>beginning of the Cold War you know in<br>1945 to the early 1950s the West as it<br>was emerging and recovering from World<br>War two really had no economic linkages<br>with the Soviet Union and the Soviet<br>bloc and so the struggle was easy from a<br>conceptual level you have two rival<br>blocks that each occupy different<br>geographies around the world with<br>different ideological systems<br>underpinning them and both understood<br>that they weren't locked into a<br>long-term competition and so national<br>security managers were figuring out how<br>to prevail for their side in in that<br>struggle you know I think that for many<br>administrations over the last 20 plus<br>years there's been a hope that as China<br>grew in in power it would emerge and<br>behave in ways that other states have<br>done this you know japan and germany<br>both merged and really focused on being<br>creating powers they did not try to<br>recapture the sort of the great powers<br>that they were they were striving to be<br>curing that the 1920's and 1930's<br>china appears to have chosen a different<br>course and so i think it is now a<br>structural challenge the management of<br>that then is what really is focusing<br>minds both in Washington and I presume<br>in Beijing because if you accept the<br>argument I just made you knowledge that<br>there's an economic interdependence<br>between the United States and China you<br>come on you can't use the same playbook<br>that you used your in the Cold War so<br>we're in uncharted territory and we're<br>already trying to figure out how to to<br>manage a competitive international<br>environment in ways that maintain global<br>peace because any kind of war between<br>the United States and China would be<br>incredibly devastating and so again I'm<br>gonna credit actually tell us with this<br>because it's not my<br>my idea or my insight but um the two<br>biggest losers in this in this rivalry<br>if it's not managed well will actually<br>be the United States and China for one<br>last question yes hi I'm Alex Babylon a<br>Victoria student so my question was and<br>this is for anyone how do you find the<br>supply shortages being resolved like do<br>you think these states will begin<br>producing domestically or somebody else<br>will fill in this absent role supply<br>sorted shortages what just in general<br>economic decoupling are you talking<br>about supply shortages as a result of<br>economic decoupling yes so will economic<br>decoupling mean that manufacturing will<br>go back to the US or elsewhere the<br>economic architecture change as a result<br>of economic decoupling I'll let my<br>colleagues talk a little bit about the<br>u.s. I will say that if you look at the<br>impact of say the us-china trade war<br>certain Southeast Asian countries have<br>benefited from that right because once<br>you have tariffs on Chinese<br>manufacturers even China Chinese<br>companies there was a great study done<br>by the World Bank are seeking to access<br>US market Vietnam was the preferred<br>country they looked at 33 companies the<br>majority went to Vietnam if he went to<br>Malaysia none went to Indonesia so you<br>do see certain Southeast Asian countries<br>benefiting from decoupling now that's<br>just one aspect if you have a further<br>decoupling I think it's really gonna<br>yeah I think two examples on on sort of<br>decoupling as a phenomenon that's<br>already taking place for a lot of<br>Japanese companies after the Japanese<br>government nationalized the Senkaku<br>Islands in a way to try and avoid it<br>being a political problem between Japan<br>and China in 2012 and then there was a<br>series of very strong protests against<br>Japan and you know vandalism against<br>Japanese facilities in China Japanese<br>corporate boards were beginning to look<br>more broadly at parts of Southeast Asia<br>as places to establish their<br>manufacturing sites it partly driven as<br>well so politics is part of it part of<br>it was just pure economics as China has<br>got richer labor costs within China have<br>risen and increasingly it's it's more<br>cost-effective if you're a major<br>multinational company to look at<br>producing in in parts of developing<br>Southeast Asia whether the cost of<br>production is lower to phenomenon since<br>then I think have really accelerated<br>that trend and the first was driven by<br>the the Trump administration's trade<br>policy the uncertainties that flow from<br>the sort of imposition of tariffs<br>against China are a major concern from<br>lots of businesses because they<br>literally didn't know from day to day or<br>week to week what kinds of tariffs they<br>would be facing when they would be put<br>in place what products they would cover<br>and just again that once you get into a<br>trade war and both sides have the<br>ability to use that as a tool you create<br>an enormous amount of uncertainty that<br>for businesses is really problematic and<br>so a lot of them were beginning to<br>realize that their supply chains were<br>perhaps too dependent on China because<br>they were beginning to suffer in the<br>trade war and they were starting to look<br>for alternatives to that the koban 19<br>outbreak I think is now going you can<br>accelerate that track<br>and because they think you will<br>encourage companies to to take a hard<br>look at their supply chains to the<br>extent that they can it will encourage<br>governments to take a hard look at where<br>some of their core resources come from<br>whether those are energy or food I mean<br>that the fundamental things that you<br>need to make sure you can satisfy the<br>needs of your population and again this<br>sort of echoes sort of part of what I<br>think Nagi you were saying we're moving<br>into new territory that we haven't seen<br>before where the globalized world that<br>we've been living in for the last thirty<br>plus years may be starting to shift and<br>evolve in ways that there are sort of<br>new for us and I think you know we all<br>this as as citizen to various countries<br>as companies and as governments are<br>trying to navigate what that means to an<br>end if you could join me in thanking our<br>speakers<br>there is opportunity to continue these<br>discussions more informally outside<br>where refreshments and drinks Arthur</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
