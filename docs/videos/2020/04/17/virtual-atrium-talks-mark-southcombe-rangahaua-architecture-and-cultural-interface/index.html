The design approach of the architects as aligned other, its foundation and operation as active 24/7 Marae within a tertiary institution, and the projects temporal nature, may be reflected on.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

Mike Aston teaching me when I was<br>there but the clients were very clear<br>and I remember more than standing there<br>with his arms outstretched and said no<br>it must have that traditional mud I and<br>so I had to work with that and that's<br>what we did design they could use the<br>facilities for pretty much anything they<br>liked as long as it didn't bring the<br>Polytechnic into disrepute a great many<br>things happened there at rush hour and<br>many of them kind of marginally<br>associated with the politic system it<br>was to be neutral space hospitality<br>space a space for people to stay to<br>expand contract to accommodate everyone<br>and everything that may be required<br>it really abstracted a the architectural<br>concept a traditional mud ice structure<br>as a single building so the normal mud I<br>complex was compressed down into this<br>one building and there was lots of<br>really careful<br>Oh Shi ation about that and discussion<br>it took quite awhile and they were and<br>it was discussion with big groups<br>including representation from all a week<br>construction and opening the Murray<br>concept and values also underpinned the<br>construction a Maori stone from the<br>paula new river was placed under the<br>building foundations towards the<br>excavation towards the end of excavation<br>and traditional protocols excluding<br>female visitors to the site during<br>construction were immediately<br>contentious without going too deeply<br>into it it was updated contractors also<br>had some female contractors who were<br>allowed to work on site so it it was it<br>was part of the client brief really and<br>it was important to the client group<br>however one of the politic council<br>members female council member really<br>considered this to be a sexist protocol<br>and have no place at all in the<br>contemporary educational institution so<br>she deliberately broke the protocol and<br>that caused immeasurable hurt really<br>immeasurable head and it resulted in the<br>Morris stone being dug up and returned<br>to the river the mahi and amo there that<br>framed the central courtyard space would<br>not no longer would no longer be erected<br>and so the building is completed it<br>looked as you see it there and I'm going<br>to skip through the design itself you<br>can see the different views moving<br>around this is the main courtyard space<br>and here we have the kitchen one of the<br>things that I can't say the<br>is that it through my understanding of<br>educational institutions on its head<br>because really it was primarily a place<br>of Murray hospitality and welcome before<br>it was an educational institution so<br>this kitchen was actually the most<br>important place this kitchen was where<br>everybody would come and sit down and<br>have hospitality before they would meet<br>or greet or do anything else so the idea<br>that a reception and so on would be<br>important here's the photic I also used<br>for various teaching lots of different<br>sorts including particularly Black Sea<br>weaving we here is the Runanga room<br>which also operated there's two<br>classrooms to see it down on the right<br>split particularly for language teaching<br>people sat on the floor so yeah this is<br>a quote from more than silent with its<br>own two Kohanga REO run by national<br>identities pecking and Quixote what a<br>teeny we had a living mud I particularly<br>as to run across satellites commenced<br>sending their students to write powerful<br>truth it was an awesome buzzer to clash<br>cultural teams practicing choirs<br>training mahi how can I can i lumbering<br>up tight each student's straightening<br>haka bending across the yard crew a cup<br>hopper singing now putting a wire hanger<br>weaving painting and carving Uncle Dave<br>Tiki Running Start meetings<br>Judd daily mastering his craft in bone<br>and stone Fleck guitars gasping for air<br>Genet learning her latest opera

caring the girls<br>expanding their lungs tipping emoji<br>honing the art of oratory Brendan pocket<br>RP talking modems Co hanger primary and<br>secondary buses coming and going<br>incredible but true<br>it was absolutely to Mickey it was a<br>24-hour seven-day-a-week<br>operation there was always people there<br>and there was people living there it was<br>true living model within eight years to<br>a student population of 600 across 25<br>outposts throughout New Zealand and by<br>1998 it was the largest Maori teaching<br>trend provider in the hundred and fifty<br>to major events in the life of Ranga how<br>are particularly memorable the first of<br>these was the Prius formal graduation of<br>students from the tea Wrangler program<br>in 96 and marriland Raider<br>noted that the Mari liked the life force<br>built up over time and had a physical<br>feel instilled by the people passing<br>through and in preparation for that<br>event<br>the my in honor of the Fadi were<br>installed as originally designed in the<br>former head of the poly tech John Scott<br>was invited to come in with them the<br>newly installed entrance<br>the second major event was the death and<br>mourning of Kamata where Henry Bennett<br>in 1998 where the family had the honor<br>of being invited to help him relay and<br>state at rung how're the four tape being<br>taken to Chi me ma die for<br>Tony it was extraordinary the sunset<br>these images of motor Gardens park today<br>and the same people were involved in<br>both Rana hawa and the celebration that<br>was headed here at the park I tore a and<br>so rang rang how I had a period of<br>growth in flowering before falling from<br>grace as part of a Labour government<br>rationalization of the Terri education<br>sector the same things happening again<br>and it resulted in the closure of the<br>community-based Polytechnic which when<br>you look back seems such an<br>many of the people involved in Rana<br>Hauer consider that it was painting for<br>for motor gardens Rana how I was in<br>active living Murray that coexisted with<br>in a terry educational institution it is<br>like a model I conserved as a matter I<br>it references actual history yet is<br>contemporary and has a practical<br>education function it is has beautiful<br>design lines in the sensitive relation<br>to its landscape it's not tucked away in<br>a corner of a canvas it has a large art<br>ear space in front giving an appropriate<br>prominence that was quote from john<br>scott raha was the precursor also for<br>picking at Unitec and interestingly the<br>king was briefed to be not a mat I like<br>running our rather it was conceived as a<br>Maori education workplace exemplified<br>exemplifying moral knowledge as a<br>teaching tool through the tacit teacher<br>so and we were commissioned to do this<br>in a socio<br>with Rayleigh and Rayleigh was a design<br>lead on the project but it's interesting<br>because 15 years later in his quote from<br>Deirdre Brown and the centrality of the<br>Maha I as a cultural symbol and ritual<br>space remains an important concept to<br>this day as demonstrated with pooja<br>being recently joined 15 years after its<br>opening by Lionel Grant's meetinghouse<br>and and so this idea somehow that the<br>mud I and the function of the matter is<br>might have a relevance within a tertiary<br>institution more than at the opening of<br>Raya how I described it as a new walker<br>of a new vehicle to take us on a journey<br>from where we are to where we going and<br>that's exactly what happens there the<br>this is these photos of run how recent<br>ones and you'll see that the magia<br>Narmer has come down that could come<br>down for maintenance this is now at the<br>home of the - PO - our trust and so<br>there was a new life coming there it was<br>created by an architectural and<br>management process that impaired Maori<br>the architect operating is aligned other<br>and the politic operating in genuine<br>partnership mode and this gave space<br>brought us called deep diversity of<br>activity and protocol necessary for a<br>holistic Murray environment to occur and<br>for us to be seen not as peripheral but<br>actually as a core part of the<br>educational service delivery it also<br>gave space for the architecture to be<br>actively informed by the client group in<br>the participating model and with the<br>client groups specialists cultural<br>expertise dominating arrow here is<br>ambiguous mediating and giving form and<br>space to group intentions<br>through discursive development and it<br>results in a blended authorship with the<br>client group and Murray architecture<br>through Maori community without access<br>to a Maori architect this is our final<br>slide and I'd like to finish with a<br>quote from Mary Bennett Uncle Henry's<br>son rahowa was born by Maori not for<br>Maori and that is different<br>RAAA Tiwanaku er was not just about a<br>brown teacher troll program it was also<br>fundamentally different Ranga hawa is<br>about the people it just is there is no<br>question when you are here everybody<br>knows it it's Maori space people have a<br>tremendous pride in being part of it so<br>that finishes the the presentation would<br>be happy to take any questions that<br>people have and I would also say there's<br>there's the full version of the paper is<br>really flesh as a lot of it out and kind<br>of a disc is a very I think important<br>discussion to be had about the nature of<br>the space itself like that quote from<br>Mary for me is really fantastic because<br>it<br>what it does is it suggests or what is<br>it that's different about this and yeah<br>so that kind of analysis will will<br>actually show that it is quite different<br>space to in the way it's formed and the<br>way it operates particularly Thank You<br>Mac it was fantastic and if you want if<br>the clip icon on this<br>oh there we go<br>great well thank you very much it was<br>fascinating and I had a headache<br>Christian I'll talk my slave just<br>listening to you but I will let others<br>ask me a questions first so can we go<br>with Regan start with Jeremiah fantastic<br>presentation and you must it sounds like<br>it was a really incredible journey and<br>you are so fortunate to be a look back<br>on it but look back on it now what what<br>what what's the main thing that you<br>remember what's the main feeling or the<br>main seats that you take you take from<br>that experience that you hear because it<br>was quite a it wasn't just solely<br>architectural that you're engaged with<br>yeah and I guess they have a very warm<br>place as a place of warm welcome I was<br>welcoming really as part of the fannia<br>and adopted this part of the from now I<br>would say well I know that I know that<br>and so there's something about the way<br>it operates that is fundamentally<br>different to a normal Tara institution<br>and I've tried to entertain a lot of the<br>things that occurred there wouldn't be<br>able to occur at 3w for instance you<br>know they were to cutting a layer at one<br>time<br>they're also operating there at one time<br>that you know they would they would just<br>shift and the reason that that happened<br>was because<br>they were also facilitating the<br>emergence of of other Maori educational<br>institutions but they also saw them as<br>being fundamental to what they were<br>doing so even though they were tear suri<br>they saw cutting rayou as a part of what<br>they were doing an important part of<br>what they were doing not different not<br>separate it's the same with the current<br>so there was these relationships that<br>were developed through out the region<br>that people were coming and going as<br>this hub really I would describe it is<br>yeah I don't know if that answers your<br>question<br>Regan's so none for me that for me and I<br>was always sensitive to the culture I<br>hit that um huge benefit of being taught<br>by my costume so in I was in bricks to<br>do with him as well so I I had that<br>sensitivity I knew a way through through<br>children and as well so yeah it was a<br>great opportunity and presto for me as a<br>young architect I was very ambitious was<br>a little frustrating my goose yeah<br>but looking back I did have the humility<br>to work things through and show the<br>alternatives and respect my lack of<br>cultural knowledge no for instance when<br>the client group said no we all have no<br>black no no black colour no we're<br>blackest deal and that was the position<br>they took and that's what happened and<br>they were great many decisions all the<br>way through that we're done in this<br>interactive Amina<br>one of the one of the big things that I<br>noticed because I know yeah I know<br>cooking I'm quite welcome from unity yes<br>have the architectural language that<br>that you used yes on this night as seems<br>to be courtyards and they're linked the<br>yes yes brutal yeah it's got the lovely<br>walk around I don't know any comments<br>microwave it's just just looking at the<br>pictures I can see how the architecture<br>made quite a bit of difference in this<br>place compete suit he did Pocoyo yes<br>well this place literally influenced<br>picking and when I say that we worked on<br>beginning we did like we with it was a<br>joint collaboration although it's never<br>it accredited and so this literally<br>shaped it and there was a kind of a<br>reaction against it in a way there was a<br>reaction against its marinus the fact<br>that it was just this almost unruly at<br>times grab of activity right there was a<br>sense that no actually that didn't quite<br>fit with the sort of tear Surrey<br>institution in the relationship they had<br>there it also really affected it and<br>that to King as a far more narrative<br>architecture and so there are these<br>wonderful series of stories woven into<br>it and here and the client group<br>literally didn't want that and that<br>forced and seems very unusual why would<br>they not want there they were very<br>sensitive to the other mud I I mean we<br>did not want to compete with the manner<br>of other mud i right so the whereas the<br>marinus was important right deliberately<br>the my he were not carved except with<br>fingers right at the very end<br>right and the the patterning that was<br>introduced throughout that was based on<br>those two beautiful artworks by Bob<br>young king who one of which hands within<br>one hour and the other way of which was<br>gifted to Michael Payne on his<br>retirement from the Polytechnic by the<br>people so yeah very different yeah so in<br>and again I think that quote by more<br>than says a lot the idea of the Walker<br>it was what it would do was more<br>important was most important right and<br>yeah there are some really unique things<br>about it as a tertiary institution and I<br>remember the property manager just<br>tearing his hair out about it you know<br>because it was unruly the design is<br>unruly it's got 16 rating the outside<br>doors or something right so people can<br>come and go and look and shift and move<br>through it and in in ways that typically<br>doesn't happen within in a tearoom<br>institution can I ask a bit more about<br>that because when you were talking he<br>said something like all this this<br>couldn't have happened at Victoria<br>University I said I didn't I didn't<br>specifically mean to make an example of<br>us or no no we were not but I think in<br>any institution it didn't really happen<br>at Unitec either right you see in effect<br>they reacted against it almost as this<br>multiple programming I would call it<br>endless merging of the educational<br>program and a more general a more<br>general and more ID based<br>I was more mean I wasn't meaning that<br>you weren't being critical has more<br>meaning that that it would be quite hard<br>to imagine and Victoria University<br>architecture school with with kids<br>running around and called cetera<br>actually the last few weeks when we've<br>been in lockdown there's actually been<br>really lovely to see kids kind of<br>hanging off people's shoulders and<br>instead of running in and yelling mummy<br>or daddy or whatever and I've really<br>liked seeing that that kind of the sort<br>of humanity the the the way that people<br>are actually human and you know that we<br>don't tend to kind of appreciate I guess<br>and and the actual kind of physical<br>context of the Act II just go and I<br>wondered whether he had any thoughts<br>about whether how in the in the new<br>design of the school you might bring at<br>least some principles of it that of what<br>you've learnt in what has had happened<br>in this face to the to our school yeah<br>well the sorts of things that would<br>start to happen as things that the<br>institution would see as peripheral<br>would become more central there would be<br>an early childhood education center<br>within the space why would that be it's<br>so that people aren't so far from their<br>children you know students often have<br>children too academics have children and<br>the difference it makes<br>I know at places like the Ministry of<br>Education<br>sorry Ministry of Environment which has<br>an early childhood education center in<br>its base exactly for those same reasons<br>right as a support service for start so<br>there could be things like that<br>and the focus on social and hospitality<br>right so that when you bring guests<br>where did he take them you know at the<br>moment is that question in terms of my<br>record protocol<br>where do we take them in for for staff<br>anyway and students won't really be<br>quite so aware of this but we're not<br>very well served by staff facilities<br>here so it's not so easy to give people<br>for her hospitality we tend to do it out<br>across the road and it carries some we<br>yeah<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
