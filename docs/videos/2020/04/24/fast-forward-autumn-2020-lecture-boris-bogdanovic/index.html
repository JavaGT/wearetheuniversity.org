to me<br>you know it day out of ha Gekko tokoto<br>no Academy then I got the DNR Cortado<br>good thought this was a great deal of<br>personal and professional pleasure to<br>introduce fast-forwards first week of<br>the spring in 2020 Barr spoke very much<br>before I say more embarrassed I would<br>like to thank Jeb for the soul song<br>sponsorship of this flagship public<br>lecture series which serves as an<br>important bridge between academia and<br>industry such events not possible<br>without their ongoing support now Morris<br>bartha's alumni of the school he<br>graduated ah yes he graduated from the<br>school with a Bachelor of architecture<br>with first class honours in 2006 that<br>was boss's mother save Ron behave during<br>his time at the school he showed<br>exemplary student leadership towards<br>raising conservation issues in the built<br>realm through teaching the establishment<br>of an essay prize as well as high school<br>involvement with the body student body<br>initiative initiatives since then he has<br>been incredibly busy<br>well I cannot list all his achievements<br>years that would take all night some<br>notable ones include the 2016 adding him<br>trust full scholarship for work in the<br>architectural development of London<br>house and the spare with B M planchet<br>scholarships in 2012 for practical<br>conservation traditional conservation<br>struction and repair of historic<br>buildings currently the director of<br>urban regeneration for turquoise<br>mountain Amman Jordan<br>Boris also previously held the role of<br>international conservation architect for<br>turquoise mountain in Kabul Afghanistan<br>we're all very excited to hear<br>more about his architectural journey<br>from Altidore to jordan please join me<br>in welcoming him thank you very much<br>Cara Mia can you all hear me I've<br>clearly and easily good kyo tato<br>everyone good evening assalamualaikum wa<br>barakatu thank you very very much for<br>joining me tonight<br>first and foremost big THANK YOU to jib<br>to the University of Auckland and to the<br>National Institute of creative arts and<br>industries who very generously invited<br>me here and supported this lecture as<br>Kara said my name is Boris I am<br>presently director of urban regeneration<br>at the turquoise mountain foundation I'm<br>honored to be this year's first speaker<br>of the fastforward lecture series<br>addressing urban growth in response my<br>presentation is entitled urban growth<br>after urban decline and regeneration in<br>states of conflict and I will be talking<br>about some projects I have been doing in<br>Afghanistan and in Jordan over the last<br>four years as Kara also mentioned is a<br>particular pleasure to be here this<br>evening because before all these years<br>away and the many gray hairs in my beard<br>I was once a very keen and very happy<br>student here at the School of<br>Architecture and I'm very very excited<br>to see many dear friends teachers and<br>fellow professionals working in New<br>Zealand and elsewhere so thank you all<br>very much for coming you have to bear<br>with me I was very ambitious in planning<br>this lecture so I've I'm trying to cover<br>a lot of ground in in sticking to the 45<br>minutes I've been assigned to allow for<br>questions and discussion after this<br>evening I would like to cover five main<br>points firstly I would like to tell you<br>a little bit about the organization I<br>work for which is<br>non-for-profit that works to improve<br>livelihoods through heritage and culture<br>secondly I will tell you a bit about my<br>department that I'm presently leading<br>where we are trying to build skills and<br>help through Community Development third<br>I will share with you some projects that<br>I completed in Afghanistan specifically<br>in Kabul which tended to be focused on<br>reviving traditional urban architecture<br>fourth I will share with you some<br>emerging work that we are undertaking in<br>the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan which is<br>actually effect focusing on regenerating<br>regenerating an archaeological inherited<br>site a slight departure from our normal<br>work and finally I would like to<br>conclude with some points that this<br>lecture was very useful actually in<br>making me reflect on and some ideas<br>about what I think is particularly<br>important when you are undertaking urban<br>regeneration in such sensitive contexts<br>so turquoise mountain foundation is as I<br>say a nonprofit organization that<br>supports livelihoods through cultural<br>heritage what does that mean we are<br>essentially an organization focused on<br>four main pillars urban regeneration<br>which tends to be the beginning of<br>almost all of our projects traditional<br>arts and crafts which are which are the<br>in support of often in support of the<br>urban regeneration and the skills needed<br>to restore and repair buildings as well<br>as finding other traditional crafts such<br>as jewelry and image you have here which<br>are then subsequently supported through<br>a business and enterprise wing and<br>finally in order to sustain the arts and<br>crafts and skills we've gained we pursue<br>training and education both through<br>programs and an institute we've set up<br>in Kabul we operate in four countries of<br>Rajasthan after that Myanmar most<br>recently Saudi Arabia and very very<br>recently in Jordan the organization was<br>set up in 2006<br>under the patronage and the leadership<br>of His Royal Highness Prince Charles the<br>Prince of Wales and you see him up there<br>in the top left corner with the Duchess<br>of Cornwall and they are standing in a<br>scion a traditional Afghan pavilion that<br>was built in Kabul and sent for an<br>exhibition that was held at Buckingham<br>Palace earlier last year that is only<br>one of the wider aspects we've started<br>to undertake as an organization and<br>through the exhibitions and shows that<br>we do we are trying to promote the local<br>cultures and traditions we work in<br>furthermore we collaborate with<br>international designers in the image on<br>the right you see people small a good<br>friend and dear collaborator a British<br>jewelry designer working with seda one<br>of our students from the Institute in<br>Kabul we then use our networks of<br>friends allies and business associates<br>to promote sales and production of our<br>products around the world and most<br>recently the products from Jordan have<br>been on sale at the department store<br>Portman Mason in London and finally and<br>perhaps most interestingly for me a<br>recent development has been almost<br>looking into the tourist sector and<br>curating experiences for international<br>visitors and sharing our sights with<br>both local and and international<br>tourists there are many many wonderful<br>statistics we like to show off about all<br>true and all very very proud of over 150<br>buildings have been restored through our<br>programs around the world thousands of<br>artisans have been trained thousands of<br>building professionals have been given<br>support millions of dollars on sales<br>have been generated dozens of businesses<br>have been<br>created and most interestingly there has<br>been thousands of patients that have<br>gone through a clinic that we have set<br>up in Kabul and I'll mention a little<br>bit more in a later slide<br>so urban regeneration a very hot topic<br>for many many years<br>and as an architect as a conservation<br>specialist something I've often been<br>interested in but never really had a<br>chance to engage in until I started<br>working at turquoise mountain and I<br>thought I would share with you the model<br>that we apply to pretty much all of our<br>sites it all starts with that topmost<br>hexagon where we focus on a heritage<br>interest asset that we consider to have<br>special interest I'm using those very<br>Universal quite bland words of heritage<br>asset and special interest because the<br>heritage asset can be pretty much<br>anything can be a house it can be a<br>complex of buildings or it can be an<br>entire neighborhood and what often<br>happens is that these special interest<br>heritage assets tend to be in areas that<br>have either either are in active<br>conflict as is the case in Afghanistan<br>or are in areas that are dealing with<br>the fallout and the reaction to regional<br>conflict as is the case in Jordan they<br>often come with a community in need<br>which is the next X agon and that mean<br>can be socio-economic it can be medical<br>it can be psychological there are many<br>many aspects we try and cover as best as<br>we can in the long term projects but<br>most importantly that community will<br>have traditional skills that will need<br>revival that will need support that may<br>need be learning and we work very very<br>closely with them to decide what it is<br>that special about the traditions that<br>they have in order to then design<br>projects that support the community and<br>as I say while repairing and restoring<br>the heritage asset and all leading to<br>benefit for the community itself so when<br>this perpetuum mobile' a concept works<br>at its best we can work our way around<br>hood or a site endlessly recreating and<br>adjusting ourselves as we go now<br>obviously being urban regeneration and<br>being very much based on the build realm<br>it tends to start with practical<br>training I mean the image you see here<br>is a project we were working on in<br>Yangon the capital of Myanmar where we<br>we worked with some colonial era<br>buildings in the historic center of the<br>city that was a risk of demolition but<br>it must go beyond that it must always go<br>beyond just a build project and the<br>image I'm showing here from Jordan is<br>some of the kids in the cultural<br>heritage outreach project we're running<br>in some refugee camps in the northeast<br>of Jordan where we are I mean this is<br>very very small but very important<br>because these guys are the future of<br>that country and will hopefully engage<br>with the built environment they're<br>studying traditional building techniques<br>and the history of eleventeen<br>architecture and then the more time you<br>spend with a community and that's one of<br>the most important things we stand by<br>you when you inevitably begin to see<br>many many other problems and case in<br>points in in Kabul the area I will talk<br>a little bit more about later was not<br>just deprived but suffering from a lack<br>of basic infrastructure so a major<br>project not very romantic and not very<br>appealing to many donors was just<br>repaving the streets introducing good<br>sanitation building some water pumps<br>electricity and then as time went on the<br>clinic I mentioned became essential and<br>here is dr. Heckman with one of our<br>23,000 patients that pass through every<br>year and the clinic is only grown and<br>grown it started as a as a mother Child<br>Center but is now as an x-ray room a<br>psychology service a dentist etc etc so<br>what I'm trying to say with this slide<br>is that urban regeneration must extend<br>beyond the bones and muscle of buildings<br>and start to connect with the wider<br>community indeed it was Afghanistan<br>where our project began in<br>2006 as I said earlier and I really like<br>starting presentations on Hannah Stan<br>with with with with this image with this<br>slide because I think so often our<br>perception of this remarkable country is<br>obviously heavily based on the news and<br>the suffering all true and the<br>difficulties all accurate that you see<br>however what we don't often see is a<br>remarkable history and a great potential<br>in the present so the images on the left<br>are some 19th century late 9th century<br>photographs taken by a German traveller<br>that for me define a couple of very<br>important points firstly that essential<br>quality of Afghan urban architecture and<br>in the Islamic world in general that<br>beautiful tension between public and<br>private on the Left some of the external<br>walls in very very plain almost<br>defensive earth construction but inside<br>an incredible richness of technique of<br>style of presentation and on the the<br>farthest images the grades are I decide<br>hush in suraíh one of our major projects<br>we worked on for many many years and<br>completed in the last few which is an<br>attempt to go back and an attempt to<br>revive the pride and revive the success<br>of the buildings of carpals past a bit<br>of context for you all sorry about the<br>pixelation but I think it's all fairly<br>clear so I understand is a country in<br>Central Asia<br>it is like most troubled parts of the<br>world that are crossroads surrounded by<br>many many interesting other countries<br>the cultural impact on Afghanistan is is<br>unbelievable I was blown away by the<br>richness and the hybridity of what I saw<br>there so to the north you get this<br>fascinating Turkic influence from places<br>like aspectus tan tajikistan and<br>turkmenistan from the east comes<br>the art and culture of the Mughal Empire<br>of India and Pakistan and equally<br>importantly from the West you get the<br>Persian influence and what it leads to<br>is a fascinating conglomeration of arts<br>and culture our work was in Kabul the<br>Afghan capital itself a very very<br>ancient city and the area we were<br>working in called Marathon II was on the<br>very edge of what is considered the old<br>city now the old city defined by these<br>amazing old walls sits between the two<br>centers of power a very very important<br>point when it comes to our neighborhood<br>which I'll tell you about shortly the<br>ancient site of the royal fort and the<br>more recent site of the royal palace i<br>mean we could spend a whole lecture just<br>discussing the development of Kabul<br>which as a city that really fascinates<br>me the neighborhood itself sits in this<br>funny little dip in the Darya a Kabul<br>the Kabul River and is banked on the on<br>the east and the west side by the Kabul<br>River and has managed to survive in<br>amongst quite extensive modern<br>development and the reason the reason<br>one to work inward Hani was twofold<br>firstly as you can see the historic<br>urban form is very evident you'll see<br>how we found it in the next slide but<br>essentially we discovered one of the few<br>contiguous historic urban environments<br>in Kabul we don't have the best<br>buildings I won't lie we're not the<br>oldest part of town but we do have the<br>urban form almost intact although in<br>desperate need for help and secondly and<br>more importantly there was a very very<br>impoverished community that really<br>really needed our help and we wanted to<br>work with them and help them revive<br>their their area<br>now that struggle in water honey was<br>incredibly evident when we walked in<br>there 14 years ago the area was almost<br>entirely covered<br>with rubbish it had been used as a<br>dumping ground by the city over many<br>many decades there were upwards of six<br>feet of garbage and something like three<br>hundred and ninety thousand cubic meters<br>had to be shifted by hand every man had<br>a shovel every woman helped if she could<br>and that was the first task now once<br>that was gotten rid of we discovered one<br>of my one of the directors calls it a<br>lunar landscape which I quite love this<br>lunar landscape of melted Earth<br>buildings with odd bits of timber<br>sticking out they were so tantalizing<br>and so interesting and plant forms that<br>you could barely discern and once we<br>started to uncover those we came across<br>incredible buildings some almost 200<br>years old which for the development the<br>city is quite old and not to mention the<br>quality and taking the high technique of<br>the Himalayan cedar carvings the<br>surviving plaster works inside it gave<br>us a sense that this was an incredibly<br>precious and important location and for<br>all of the suffering and for all of the<br>high rates of child mortality and bad<br>water and poor sanitation yet yet<br>through all of it was this that gave us<br>all hope and kind of a sense that<br>beneath it all was an incredibly<br>important and surviving spiritual<br>cultural and social life so what you see<br>there is the golden dome of the shrine<br>of a puzzle the most important Shia<br>Muslim holy site in Kabul and one of the<br>main reasons why people kept coming<br>there and why the area survived and on a<br>much more humble but I think equally<br>charming story this funny little wooden<br>box that you see on the house just<br>beyond the bazaar which runs this way<br>you see them all over the neighborhood<br>and those are sites for what's called<br>kofta Baazi which literally means pigeon<br>play and it is a local hobby where<br>people trained pigeons to fly and<br>perform tricks so<br>these kind of sweet moments of social<br>life made us realize that all was not<br>lost and they were not wrong in arriving<br>a new place it was very very important<br>to come to grips with well first and<br>foremost understanding the urban form<br>and the public life as I say the area<br>was populated by a struggling community<br>that had gone through huge IRB's and<br>flaws in its history and the reason<br>they've gone through huge ins and flows<br>is that they were marginalized they were<br>the people who live in more akane are<br>descendants of the Kissel Bosch who are<br>a Turkic ethnic group who came to<br>Afghanistan very very interestingly with<br>the first one of the first official<br>kings as his mercenary soldiers now like<br>most kings he didn't trust his own<br>people he paints someone else to come<br>and protect him and these people were<br>foreigners as I said they are Shia in a<br>majority Sunni country even then and now<br>they were very close to the king<br>therefore very wealthy very influential<br>and soon rose to the level of becoming<br>courtiers at the royal palace so they<br>weren't very popular with the wider<br>population and often had purges and even<br>massacres in their neighborhood and what<br>we found was an area that was basically<br>defensive it was a neighborhood that<br>could close itself down if there ever<br>was an attack and as a result of this<br>trauma essentially which it was the<br>neighborhood was very wary very insurer<br>very defensive of some random foreigners<br>coming to say hey we want we want to<br>help so as part of understanding how the<br>neighborhood worked and participating in<br>public life it was very important to<br>work with our neighbors and this image<br>is one of the after shots when the work<br>was completed but I think it illustrates<br>the vibrant social life of the bazaar<br>from which we got everything<br>bread was bought from the bakery for our<br>communal lunches rural cap gems were<br>bought from the jewelry Bazaar which is<br>in the same area for our jewelry school<br>I mean sure that every single tool we<br>bought was bought from the guys on the<br>street<br>I work the blacksmith to build the<br>chisels and hammers that we need to use<br>on the side in that way showing<br>solidarity showing trust in what's being<br>built and made equally importantly there<br>was a real stress on working as much as<br>possible with the local community<br>frankly to the exclusion of many others<br>so if any the people look more at honey<br>got precedence it was their neighborhood<br>it was their town even they were there<br>building so this is actually an image of<br>the first building I designed and<br>completed in Merida honey and built with<br>with a team from from the neighborhood<br>and what's what's important to stress<br>here in reviving not just the tradition<br>but helping to rebuild that neighborhood<br>that urban form was that our houses<br>although this was a completely new build<br>and interesting debate took place about<br>restoration and a new building of course<br>it was in the spirit of the place it was<br>very much sympathetic to the aesthetic<br>and the proportions and materials of the<br>wider neighborhood and it was designed<br>as a traditional Afghan house however we<br>know that flexibility and multiplicity<br>of use for the future is crucial so we<br>had lots of more lots more amenities<br>multiple toilets several kitchens and<br>today it's a dormitory for the students<br>they go to our Institute and works quite<br>well I'm told I haven't been back in a<br>few months having understood the urban<br>form it was equally crucial to get to<br>grips with the with the finer grain of<br>the buildings themselves and the<br>majority of our work actually consisted<br>of repairing existing buildings in<br>understanding the the urban form we also<br>dentists to the private life all the<br>buildings as they worked historically<br>and it was very very important never to<br>force a program on a building that<br>wouldn't work for example I had never<br>known that in Afghanistan the basic<br>living unit is a two room arrangement<br>there is always a front room the summer<br>room and the back room the pass Hana the<br>winter room and the reason for that is<br>purely climatic in the summer time you<br>spend more time<br>in the cooler fresher front room that<br>faces the courtyard and in the winter<br>you have a lovely cozy back room to<br>retire to with your family and keep warm<br>and once we understood those units we<br>could then start to devise a program<br>that worked with a building rather than<br>adjusting it to our needs the repair was<br>incredibly long and in returning<br>buildings to more appropriate uses we<br>were really trying to sustain their<br>survival in the long term what had<br>happened was that the majority of<br>buildings had become essentially storage<br>for the marketplace as I said earlier<br>the bazaar is very very close and very<br>successful but there's even a larger<br>electricity electrics bazaar and wider<br>market very close to Moore at honey and<br>all of the houses it was much more<br>lucrative for landlords to rent them as<br>storage for bits of stuff than have them<br>as houses so inevitably they began to<br>degrade they began to fail and a lot of<br>our time was spent negotiating with<br>landlords speaking with the government<br>and the local community to convince them<br>that using them as houses or schools or<br>clinics was a much was a much smarter<br>use the repair and restoration itself<br>was a very very careful balance of<br>learning while working the the looming<br>shadow amongst all of this and forgive<br>the impolite mention of money is donors<br>who support our work there is always a<br>deadline there's always some mad rush<br>and so you kind of don't have the time<br>that I dreamed I would have of slowly<br>understanding how these buildings worked<br>and appreciating their fine construction<br>you need to get in there and get on with<br>it so again as slow as it had to be we<br>were always trying to repair and learn<br>at the same time while training people<br>and finding those with the knowledge to<br>help us carry out the project when the<br>buildings were finished or at least in<br>this case the site Hashem survived was<br>finished the most appropriate hues we<br>felt was<br>the main office for operation it was<br>after all the grind is building in the<br>neighborhood but it was also ideal for<br>this school of crafts and art and<br>architecture I keep mentioning where the<br>back room could be the office for the<br>teacher and admin storage and the front<br>room became a calligraphy classroom or a<br>space for ceramics whatever else it may<br>whatever else was was felt appropriate<br>and while it yeah so in the case of the<br>site Hashem Sarai the Institute was set<br>up and continues to this day we are<br>partnered with the City &amp; Guilds School<br>in in the UK and they provide us with a<br>diploma course diploma after the<br>students finish their three-year course<br>which is meant that many of our students<br>now have an internationally accredited<br>degree diploma degree and has been<br>useful for those who unfortunately have<br>had to were decided to leave the country<br>due to the conflict having got to grips<br>with the repair process we then got on<br>with constructing new buildings so this<br>slide is about learning about external<br>materiality and learning about the<br>aspects that comprise a traditional<br>Afghan building but within a new and<br>modern setting there were many many<br>construction skills to remember relearn<br>and revive in in particular one of the<br>many we had to we had to relearn<br>together was traditional rammed earth<br>construction what was interesting<br>working in traditional materials for me<br>was just how much time it took for<br>someone to get up to speed both the<br>master who was picking up his tools for<br>the first time in a long time and let<br>alone the student who needed<br>years to come close to the Masters own<br>skill so when he came to box ah<br>traditional rammed earth construction we<br>not only had to find the right people<br>but way to find the right students and<br>on the right here is Han Agha our<br>probably our best our best and earth<br>master who very kindly as well as<br>working the construction technique<br>itself on the buildings helped us to<br>record videos and make short films and<br>do oral interviews for intangible<br>cultural heritage research which tries<br>to record these skills should they ever<br>become in danger ever again in the<br>future the technique many of you are<br>familiar is not too dissimilar from<br>other rammed earth techniques around the<br>world<br>it comes in bands which are both a<br>amount of work a man can do in a day<br>they also help with managing shrinkage<br>and I think they look quite beautiful<br>actually this this horizontal banding it<br>was pretty dark joke but it was funny<br>and in August before I left for Jordan<br>last year we had the British security<br>team come and recce Moore at Hani and<br>prepare us should there be the<br>presidential election was happening<br>things were getting a bit spicy so they<br>came to give us some support and these<br>are the big burly Muslim men came in and<br>we took them around and they said you<br>know what these walls some of them up to<br>a metre thick are quite possibly the<br>best protection from blasts and bullets<br>you can possibly get so it was some<br>comfort to know that traditional<br>construction techniques are not just<br>environmentally beneficial and helpful<br>to communities but can save your life<br>another technique that needed to be<br>relearned and revived is probably my<br>favorite because I think it's just so<br>lovely and having worked on it myself I<br>became really really interested in this<br>this is called senj it's a traditional<br>brick infill timber frame construction<br>and the way it works is well I should<br>probably first say that this is the<br>foundation this is the ground level and<br>then as you go up in the upper levels<br>you can go as high as even two and three<br>stories which is which is remarkable for<br>traditional building you start to work<br>in this methodology and what you have is<br>Poplar poles which themselves are grown<br>by a specific family in a specific part<br>of the area around Jalalabad and<br>themselves could be a whole lecture<br>alone very thin very fine very very<br>flexible and between them you then form<br>these herringbones of in this case I<br>think it's burnt brick it's not<br>sun-baked but you would do some baked<br>mud brick bound with a mud mortar in<br>alternating patterns I mean I love this<br>pattern so much I was always trying to<br>convince the the head engineer and the<br>team to leave it exposed but they would<br>say no no no no no we never worked<br>because the moment this gets wet the mud<br>mortar will get wet the bricks will fall<br>out so then you finish them with with a<br>mud render and a bit more cross bracing<br>now the reason you do this whole<br>elaborate thing is that in an earthquake<br>the building shifts it moves and what<br>happens is the alternating brick<br>herringbone falls in opposite directions<br>and because in small sections it won't<br>crush you if you're in the middle of the<br>room<br>meanwhile the poplar very flexible as I<br>said very strong will keep the roof up<br>and you won't get crushed in the falling<br>earthquake so a very very interesting<br>response to seismic issues which<br>unfortunately if that poor country<br>didn't have a bad enough already there's<br>a lot of earthquakes in in Afghanistan<br>last but not least the interiors were<br>very very important and I was fascinated<br>by the need to revive specific and very<br>small scale craft skills I mean these<br>are just 2x<br>oh sorry these are just two examples of<br>plaster work and timber work very<br>similar motifs very similar ornaments<br>but two entirely different media and two<br>entirely different traditions the<br>plaster work in particular was very very<br>interesting to me it's called sim gal<br>it's a fine mud plaster that is used for<br>molding and carving and the way it works<br>is your industry working with earth<br>and the finest earth that which is<br>sifted four or five times it is very<br>very fine clay particles which are then<br>mixed into a very runny batter<br>almost like for crepes or pancakes into<br>which you add as you can see here the<br>fluffy hairy bits at the tops of river<br>reeds and you mix that and you do it<br>with your hands and it takes a long long<br>time until finally you get this very<br>very thick consistency and you can let<br>it rot for 48 hours or to get very very<br>thick and what you get is a very smooth<br>not so obvious here but more so here<br>very smooth finish that never cracks<br>because of the inherent wetness of the<br>plaster itself and this is shahrullah<br>the best Gill car mud mud worker doing a<br>little rosette which you have made off<br>site and then stuck on and then<br>plastered another good lesson and how<br>stupid I was not knowing any of these<br>skills was saying I got to psyche one<br>day and one of the guys have been mixing<br>this mud for days and you said look it's<br>taking way too long<br>let's get the blender and just blend<br>this and you know this blenders for<br>paint<br>just forget it through foster and you<br>know the wise old engineer just looked<br>at me when it must be by hand because if<br>you do it with a machine it'll clump and<br>you won't get that same consistency that<br>you desire so much and so I had a go and<br>you sit there for hours and get the most<br>beautiful hands rubbing this mud with<br>your hands and this very distinctive<br>gesture that has been the same for<br>hundreds of years and it can only be<br>that way and here's one of the finished<br>products a traditional Afghan interior I<br>used to love I taught in Kabul at a<br>couple of universities and I used to<br>love telling students who would you<br>believe had never been in buildings like<br>this I mean that in itself is a whole<br>nother story the disconnection of Afghan<br>architecture students from their<br>heritage I used to love saying to them<br>that this entire room originally and<br>who'd pretty much be built from<br>everything we found on the site in the<br>neighborhood or within a radius of two<br>or three kilometers of cobble itself<br>obviously except for the Chinese made<br>cables and the Turkish toilet and the<br>Indian PVC for the for the plumbing but<br>it is an incredibly low carbon aspect to<br>the way that we were building there and<br>I have to finish with my last image<br>finish in Afghanistan with my last image<br>my last image is my favorite picture<br>which shows the people who made it<br>possible and the people who really<br>matter in this whole story the community<br>of more honey and I mean it was a pretty<br>serious scale of operation hundreds of<br>local people were employed and most<br>crucially most crucially those people<br>will hopefully insha'Allah stay employed<br>and or at least now have the skills to<br>go and seek employment for themselves<br>beyond the neighborhood moving swiftly<br>on I'm now going to take you four<br>thousand kilometers west to the Middle<br>East and to my most recent project which<br>is in Jordan where as I said earlier we<br>are working with an archaeological and<br>heritage site now we've been in Jordan<br>for the last couple of years and as I<br>say we didn't follow the standard model<br>of turquoise mountain we didn't start<br>with there been regeneration we've been<br>focusing more on cultural heritage<br>outreach working with these kids I was<br>mentioning in Syria and refugee camps<br>which is probably my favorite of our<br>programs secondly we have been finding<br>and working with local artisans<br>specifically Syrian exile and expats and<br>refugees who are now in Jordan and have<br>skills they can't use unless they get a<br>bit of support and very important for my<br>program training so training jewelry<br>less important for me but training and<br>carpentry and stonework all with a dream<br>of working in this<br>tantalize insight I will tell you a<br>little bit more about shortly maps for<br>context again Jordan is a country in the<br>Middle East officially known as the<br>Hashemite Kingdom it's a monarchy it<br>board it is bordered by many many<br>fascinating other countries and a bit<br>like Afghanistan it is this crossroads<br>of geological geopolitical Geographic<br>Geographic tension and benefit and<br>influence the area I'm particularly<br>interested in is in the north of the<br>country known as ancient Gadara today is<br>own case now<br>Hodari was a major city that had its<br>major ancient city that had its Golden<br>Age in the first centuries of the first<br>millennium as a member of a loose<br>confederation<br>of city-states called the Decapolis<br>cities that were at the very very edge<br>of the Roman Empire and a bit like the<br>European Union kind of helped each other<br>out economically trying to avoid war<br>however they soon came under the sway of<br>Rome and continued to thrive until about<br>the middle to end of the first<br>millennium the city itself is massive<br>it's the most fascinating site I've been<br>on not just I mean there's there's many<br>more interesting ancient cities but the<br>location is just mind-blowing and you'll<br>see it it's littered with ancient sites<br>there's a Hippodrome there's multiple<br>baths there are Byzantine chapels is a<br>basilica there's even a place where a<br>miracle happened performed by Jesus<br>Christ himself so it's a very very<br>important site and a very popular<br>tourist destination that could be even<br>more popular in our opinion now we are<br>focused only on the Acropolis the<br>ancient administrative and religious<br>part of the city<br>it is a there's a lot to say about that<br>place itself but what's most important<br>to stress is that the city was abandoned<br>as I say in the mid to late first<br>century a series of earthquakes the<br>ender Brougham various other things<br>meant that the city cannabis was left<br>with some devices until the mid 19th<br>century when the very good water an<br>amazing meet and great farmland meant<br>that some traditionally nomadic cattle<br>ranchers decided to settle the site and<br>live in the ruins of the Roman city<br>using the platform of the old Roman<br>houses not traditional villas something<br>more Middle Eastern and used the<br>materials on the site to build their own<br>buildings now all was going well and<br>there was a vibrant village life until<br>the late 70s and mid 80s when the<br>government of the kingdom decided to<br>clear the site in preparation for<br>archaeological excavation on Christ<br>wasn't the only pace place Petra had the<br>same situation you got was all these<br>people the government says relocated to<br>this interesting new city just just east<br>of the site now I spend a lot of my time<br>here I'm there at least twice a week<br>every week and stay a lot overnight as<br>well and the community doesn't call it<br>resettlement they call an expulsion so<br>there is an immense tension between the<br>old city and the new city what ended up<br>happening was the archaeological<br>excavation never took place<br>the buildings were left to ruin<br>interestingly firstly because of money<br>but secondly and I think for all of us<br>in as architects and designers because<br>conservation philosophy changed so the<br>dream was to get rid of all of these old<br>heritage crappy Ottoman village houses<br>and reveal the glory of the Roman city<br>beneath but correctly in my opinion<br>those rotten houses are as important as<br>the Roman site itself and it was left to<br>fall into ruin the reason I show this<br>image is that this is one of the last<br>surviving stairs there were a<br>distinctive aspect or village life in<br>Jordan they were used by women to move<br>privately and discreetly between houses<br>not having to go on the street and those<br>kind of details are very very special to<br>me and I think<br>worthy of preservation understanding the<br>city itself is pretty scrappy it closes<br>at 1:00 p.m. there's uh there's pretty<br>much nothing going on unemployment is<br>high I've hung out a lot with the<br>amazing mayor a lady called moon Elvis<br>Bond who just wants to see her people<br>employed and that's the local named<br>along there's also this as you're all<br>aware there's been a big war going on<br>just north of Jordan in Syria and the<br>the a bit governor where the site where<br>Bryce is located is covered with mostly<br>informal refugee settlements and people<br>in pretty desperate situations so this<br>is the social mean that we want to<br>respond to now to the west of the city<br>and many of these sad and complicated<br>refugee settlements is this incredible<br>archaeological site this is the money<br>shot this is what people travel two<br>hours from Amman to see on a clear day<br>you can see four countries and I'm very<br>lucky to be here a lot I mean over there<br>is the Sea of Galilee or Lake Tiberias<br>the West Bank and Palestine Israel when<br>the weather is clear the mountains of<br>Lebanon just here peaking to the right<br>is the Golan Heights of Syria and then<br>if I turn the camera I could show you<br>this incredible rolling landscape of<br>Jordanian valleys and then the decumanus<br>the great Roman east-west road that<br>connected this city to many others hotly<br>debated when there's an F a.m. or not a<br>basilica incredible carving on in stone<br>that was brought by the Romans from as<br>far away as Turkey and Egypt to decorate<br>their buildings and for me the bit<br>that's most overlooked these completely<br>charming completely crucial little<br>ottoman era buildings and then the wider<br>potential for a project like mine for an<br>urban regeneration project on the site<br>itself a reasonably successful<br>restaurant they could definitely employ<br>more people wonderful products<br>we can help promote and sell elsewhere<br>some decent restoration work I mean this<br>is the visitor center courtyard I'm<br>taking a lot of inspiration from their<br>use of plants but not taking inspiration<br>from their very generous use of cement<br>and concrete which isn't okay at all and<br>then wonderful people like nyla who runs<br>a guesthouse and this is Ahmed our<br>community liaison outreach who will<br>welcome into her home and for a few DNow<br>cook you a meal and there's no reason<br>why she couldn't do that more and make<br>more money and help her sister and build<br>a business the other thing we're saying<br>to the government is don't forget that<br>we need to focus on the wider tourism<br>aspect so what happens in Jordan is that<br>people do the big three in the southern<br>loop the big three being Wadi Dom Petra<br>and the Dead Sea and what we're saying<br>is cool that's great but why don't<br>people go north maybe they can use some<br>kites as their setting as their place to<br>chill and relax and then visit hot<br>springs go for walks and nature reserves<br>visit saladin's castle at a saloon etc<br>etc so we're trying to always think of<br>these macro and micro levels a very<br>quick canter through the two main<br>projects I'm thinking about right now<br>firstly what to do with the courtyard<br>houses so there's dozens of them and I<br>think they're just wonderful they've all<br>lost their roofs but the walls are in<br>pretty decent condition climatic change<br>means that we're getting a lot more rain<br>and Frost's are really bad so we are<br>slowly losing some of the ancient walls<br>particularly the exposed courtyard walls<br>themselves upwards of five ten percent<br>per year and we're notching the<br>government to hurry up and do something<br>about those I'm really keen to reinstate<br>speaking of urban form there are old<br>alleys and traditional village streets<br>and in the building themselves are a<br>combination of traditional construction<br>these are railway la rail rails from the<br>Hejaz railway<br>that became popular to be used as roof<br>beams well this is matting of bamboo<br>traditional woman by women and then<br>later houses tend to have concrete<br>reinforced concrete roofs which we can<br>also work with now what to do with those<br>this is the shiny and fun image we show<br>the ministry and our colleagues the site<br>already has a museum a restaurant<br>several cafes what it doesn't have is<br>enough accommodation so we are<br>suggesting that maybe we can think about<br>doing some accommodation facilities on<br>the site itself and that people enjoy<br>the sights and the sounds even after<br>hours the other big project is just a<br>very humble Western theatre on the<br>second century which we've taken on to<br>my great joy and also trepidation<br>because there is such a lot to do and<br>it's a very very amazing but very<br>fragile site now the story here is that<br>it's one of only two black basalt stone<br>theatres in the world its Big Brother<br>with a seating capacity of 30,000 people<br>unlike this one which is three is in<br>Basra in Syria across the border and has<br>had quite a bit of restoration and<br>repair throughout the many years it's<br>said they're not all that good<br>unfortunately and the issues are<br>immediately apparent I mean there's<br>structural failures and bowing there's<br>very very dangerous drops and falls for<br>visitors and then it's just kind of<br>unsightly and not very appealing to look<br>at and there are two ideas for the<br>Western theatre the first one very<br>humble and very quick is going to be to<br>remove all of this junk rotten wood and<br>replace it forgive the crude render with<br>some very simple barriers that will be<br>built by carpentry trainees so I'm going<br>to work with four or five carpentry<br>masters who themselves will train five<br>six as many as we can<br>carpet for your practices and from the<br>local town to make this place safe you<br>have to be very careful not to do it<br>overdo the barriers I was looking at<br>this earlier today and I'm a bit worried<br>that there's too much balustrade there<br>let's take that out and in the long term<br>courtesy of our colleagues in a firm<br>working with in London the dream is to<br>revive the theater as a performance<br>venue and that is a much bigger job and<br>I have a very esteemed and experienced<br>stone conservation expert coming out in<br>April to start writing a very<br>comprehensive proposal for the work<br>all that remains to say about Jordan is<br>that this is the relationship we have to<br>fight try and reconcile the new city and<br>its overlooked and disenfranchised<br>community and the old city which has so<br>much potential to support the people of<br>them Kies I'm very conscious that I'm<br>running out of time so I will try and<br>conclude quickly and succinctly in the<br>last four years working in this field<br>and working the development sector there<br>are a few well these are the five<br>watchwords that I try and think about<br>all the time first and foremost all this<br>talk of training is is is valid and<br>important but it's really great to<br>revive an ancient tiling tradition or an<br>Forgotten plasterwork tradition but if a<br>community needs to make money as<br>plumbers or bricklayers or electricians<br>that's just as valid and even more<br>important in my opinion in some cases<br>secondly I've noticed a tendency with<br>many NGOs to kind of go in do their work<br>make the donors happy and then balance<br>my organization has worked in Kabul for<br>14 years and the plan is to stay as long<br>in Jordan because once you finish a<br>project it's not enough to hand over the<br>key you must stay with their community<br>you must help them in those first<br>crucial complex mix months and years<br>help with maintenance help with running<br>to sustain the project in the long term<br>third flexible uses I was alluding to<br>this earlier with this first project I<br>did in morale honey<br>warehouse became a dormitory but we<br>don't know the needs of the community in<br>five 10 15 years and we must to the best<br>of our ability try and create spaces<br>that are useful now and hopefully<br>forever fourth transparent collaboration<br>it's crucial to be honest it's really<br>important to admit mistakes as much as<br>you admit your successes and talk to the<br>community about what they were happy<br>about what did work and what didn't work<br>even if it risks your pride even if it<br>risks your success with a donor and five<br>last but not least particularly in this<br>day in age sustainability sustainability<br>and how we spend our money<br>sustainability in how we use our<br>materials and sustainability in<br>environmental considerations in places<br>that have had so much harm it's very<br>very important that we do no harm and<br>that is probably the one phrase that I<br>try and do my work mostly by thank you<br>I'll be happy to take any questions or<br>comments or critique that'll make it<br>yes and no I think in in my department<br>in urban regeneration it's exceptionally<br>difficult to front the money that you<br>need to buy all the tools and get all<br>the materials and have the pickup truck<br>to them on your own company I mean at<br>one point I was proposing to our CEO I<br>mean the working world honey is kind of<br>coming to an end so those guys that I<br>say will stay employed will stay<br>employed as maintenance men but at a<br>reduced capacity so I was really keen to<br>try and set up these kind of<br>cooperatives where the guys could and<br>sadly there are always guys women don't<br>work on building sites in Afghanistan<br>not normally so that's been my dream<br>it's been much more successful in the<br>stuff I'm not directly involved with<br>such as design products and sales so<br>there are many examples of well one<br>example was a Frank called holida where<br>the office next to mine in in Moore at<br>honey so she and a friend set up a<br>little calligraphy cooperative a little<br>calligraphy company that was<br>commissioned by a Saudi hotel group to<br>replace all their fake ugly prints with<br>actual calligraphy and she Ben had to<br>hire more people to make deliver<br>disorder in a space of months and they<br>are and tens of thousands of dollars<br>which split between them was enough<br>money to sustain him for many many years<br>life in Afghanistan is is very very<br>affordable and so that is one example<br>but the big issue ironically and and and<br>stupidly is things like promotion now<br>we're so used to slick websites we're so<br>used to cool brochures shipping moving<br>stuff it's very very hard to get stuff<br>out of Afghanistan there are endless<br>delays there's a bombing the trucking at<br>the airport so we are working very very<br>hard in developing that and while there<br>are success stories there could be a lot<br>reservation is with measures to improve<br>resilience but places and the sheer<br>survival of these people actually very<br>good point I see a hundred percent and I<br>mean I'll be honest with you as dear<br>friends colleagues and family I was kind<br>of embarrassed that I hadn't thought of<br>it before this company we work with in<br>London Caulfield and Craig Bradley<br>studios and I highly commend you all to<br>look at their website they are<br>fascinating it's not just commercial and<br>reservation they are interested in<br>sustainability and their conservation<br>partner a guy I know from from from the<br>UK called Jeff rich came out and he was<br>like I see nothing of environmental in<br>your proposal have you thought about the<br>basics have you exactly that point how<br>will this community live in this lush<br>verdant field if it dries up in decades<br>or 100 years time so I'm kind of trying<br>to claw it back and you've hit a very<br>very relevant point that I'm I'm not yet<br>qualified to answer but give me six<br>months where we are particularly in<br>advice so one case is mind blowing I<br>always tell the story there when I Drive<br>up there on a rainy day all of the<br>streets are swamped with rain water<br>except for the Roman site why because<br>the Romans were engineering geniuses and<br>the camber of the deck amana's their<br>sisters their water tanks are constantly<br>collecting water why the heck are we<br>doing the same thing there the Ottoman<br>village ultimately our villagers were<br>using those cisterns a septic tanks so<br>to empty those out and try and look at<br>how we better manage water I mean Jordan<br>is one of the<br>world's most water impoverished<br>countries and I can't justify air B&amp;B<br>tourists having I guess we call<br>Hollywood showers in a place where there<br>is very very little water so you're<br>absolutely right<br>conservation and historic building<br>response must work hand in hand with<br>environmental considerations I mean<br>they're kind of they're both dirty<br>because I think they work well together<br>it's about sensitivity thoroughness of<br>understanding sympathetic responses so I<br>think it'll be a huge and important<br>aspect there it was much harder in<br>Afghanistan there is no recycling I<br>can't I tried really hard to trace the<br>wood to its source but it was often very<br>very difficult to accurately honestly<br>demonstrate that we were using<br>sustainable sources and you know when<br>you're having to buy your cables from<br>China forgive me and you know and dodgy<br>factories in Turkey that's all that's<br>available you kind of start to cut<br>corners unfortunately but Jordan is my<br>great hope I really hope we can hit that<br>environmental button much more firmly<br>yeah<br>yeah<br>do you have a team of Scouts<br>yes yes we do so he's a scout I know<br>very well it's me and I'm very I mean<br>for Jordan I got to live my life dream I<br>couldn't believe I got paid for this I<br>was I spent a month traveling the length<br>and breadth of Jordan visiting a bunch<br>of sites and some we would literally<br>walk in and you kind of get very good at<br>it you know how it is when you as an<br>architect you assess buildings you walk<br>in and you know right away if this works<br>or it doesn't<br>I mean a derelict village on a hill next<br>to a quarry isn't exactly a very sexy<br>donor project I'm sorry to say so I have<br>to be honest there is an element of<br>considering house and we can be<br>presented and an accusation often<br>leveled at my organizations that were<br>very very sad media savvy and we are<br>because you have to be you have to be<br>able to convince your donors that this<br>is something worthwhile but to answer<br>your question the the I show you in<br>perhaps I'll show separately there was a<br>very very long checklist of things like<br>is it beautiful does something as<br>practical as is it close to a major road<br>or where is the nearest city for<br>materials but the final decision I<br>actually voted I didn't vote for highs I<br>voted for a very humble at a beautiful<br>house in a city called salt quite much<br>closer to Amman but I was overruled by<br>His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales<br>he was like no it's gonna be him guys so<br>we were like okay let's do home Kai's<br>and it is it is working I mean there was<br>a lot more to it than that we presented<br>it's it is a you can also mess up and I<br>have there have been times when I Drive<br>up there and I think why are we working<br>here it's so far away it's really<br>complicated but then you work with the<br>community you see that view you learn<br>more about the traditional building<br>techniques and you think it is possible<br>and even<br>the Western theater which will require<br>whole team of specialists and<br>archeologists doesn't seem so daunting<br>when you can see the benefit for the<br>neighbors do I have time for one more<br>yeah no super interesting and thank you<br>for asking that the first time I thought<br>about this very quickly was in Kabul we<br>have huge leakage problems and the<br>engineer came in so he was like I've got<br>the best solution thar huge rolls of tar<br>from Iran and I said what I'm not sure<br>that's very environmentally friendly so<br>I then spent many many weeks trying to<br>like weave semi impervious membranes<br>that we could be from likely it all<br>failed it all rotted so in the end it<br>was Tower sadly but the point is there<br>is capacity in it and it goes back to<br>the Disco's question of trying to<br>develop these systems in Jordan were<br>very keen on using solar panels as<br>shading for the car park and there is<br>actually a company that produces solar<br>panels in Jordan not to import which is<br>awesome I'm very very keen to find as<br>many and sensitively integrates all of<br>the systems you've described because the<br>dream is to use them kites as an<br>exemplar as a pilot studying that we can<br>present to the government of Jordan and<br>say look you've got hundreds of sites<br>that are guzzling water and you know<br>flushing toilets and lot to be very very<br>dirty rubbish everywhere we must have an<br>example of how good it can be so give me<br>those six months I'll come back to you<br>with some solutions I hope yeah please<br>do please hold me hold me to it I need<br>to we have we had run out of the time<br>for this venue but please do feel free<br>to corner Boris I give these since he's<br>just getting started you know real the<br>battery is just being charged but I'd<br>like to think for us and present him on<br>the note of sustainability five<br>native trees have been planted along a<br>new zealand waterway to say thank you so<br>much sarab's order and thank you so much<br>for your wonderful presentation you gave<br>us a candidly lively and completely<br>compelling were window into this complex<br>world and I think we all found something<br>fascinating and wish you all the best</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
