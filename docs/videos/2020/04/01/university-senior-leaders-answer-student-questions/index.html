This video covers a range of things, including our teaching pause, hall payments, and what consideration will be given to students adapting to studying online.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Well we don't know that for sure but<br>what we're waiting for is a view from Government.<br>At level 4, the university has <br>to remain closed. In a few weeks time, if<br>the government reduces the, the alert level from level 4<br>level 3, we hope to be able to open parts of the university for some<br>functions at that stage, for example we<br>have asked the government to be able to get<br>our research going again at level three,<br>so that our research postgraduate<br>students can get back to work as long as<br>they maintain the physical distancing<br>requirements to prevent the spread of<br>covert 19.<br>At that level 3 there will still be<br>major restrictions on large<br>gatherings and so we're imagining will<br>still be maintaining our lectures<br>through online delivery but parts of the<br>university may be open at level 3, so<br>still up in the air I'm afraid, so no<br>concrete answer to that, we like you were<br>just waiting on governments view you on<br>when the level 4 finishes and we move down<br>to level 3 and level 2 alert levels.<br>I think we have to brace ourselves for<br>the fact that that could happen.<br>It will happen if the Covid19 epidemic is not in<br>control within the four weeks of the<br>current lockdown, so if that's the case then<br>again we just wait to see what alert level<br>the government identifies and if it<br>remains at level four we will have to<br>continue to keep the university closed<br>and to maintain more of our teaching<br>at our distance and to maintain pause<br>on out research programs.<br>It will get<br>increasingly more difficult as time goes<br>on, I do understand that, but we have no<br>choice if we're going to defeat the<br>Covid 19 epidemic and protect lives.<br>At alert level four, the campus is closed<br>and has to remain so, as those alert<br>levels drop down the scale, we hope to be able to open different parts of the<br>campus for different functions so that<br>we can get life back to normal.<br>What we're expecting is that government<br>will reduce the Covid a mid-level<br>sequentially, so we'll move over the next<br>few months, and the course of the<br>year perhaps, to alert level 4 to level 3 to level 2 and then<br>eventually to level 1.<br>Now as we go down<br>in those alert levels the campus will<br>begin to look more and more normal and<br>life will come back to normal for us in<br>our teaching and research programs and<br>our events and all the things that make<br>a lively canvas. But then might take<br>quite some time.<br>We've offered to those people who are<br>affected by Covid 19 a<br>Fees scholarship to cover the fees for<br>Trimester 2.<br>Now the reason to do<br>that was that there's a lot of people<br>being made redundant in our community<br>and we want them to have no barrier to<br>come to the university to study.<br>Of course if you made have redundant, then<br>financially you are challenged,<br>we may have dependents who were due to<br>come to the University and could<br>potentially no longer afford to do so<br>and so we wanted to remove any barrier<br>to study for those affected by Covid 19.<br>Now the offer didn't make sense to our<br>current students because a large number<br>of our current students are already<br>studying for free because of the first<br>year free program and so to support our<br>current students what we've done is<br>expanded the hardship fund so that<br>students who are current students who<br>are experiencing hardship as a result of<br>Covid can apply to our hardship fund<br>and we've uncapped that, so that<br>as many of our students who need it will<br>get support through that hardship fund,<br>so I'll encourage you as a current<br>student that you are experiencing<br>difficulties related to Covid 19 or<br>any other matter then get in there and<br>apply to that hardship and then we'll do<br>out best to support you through this tough time.<br>We haven't made those decisions as yet, <br>we are simply at the moment trying to<br>keep the university going through this<br>current trimester, understand our<br>financial position which has been<br>affected by many different happenings.<br>So at the moment what we're trying to do is<br>understand what that financial impact<br>amounts to, how we can mitigate the<br>financial challenges and from there<br>we'll be in a position to decide what<br>we're going to be doing with student<br>fees into the next cup of trimesters and<br>next couple of years.<br>Thank you very much all, keep strong, <br>keep studying, we need you to stay<br>connected and keep your learning going<br>we have got good systems to ensure that<br>we can reach out to you online and<br>continue to teach online and we will<br>keep your academic progress going so<br>that you will still graduate from your<br>degrees and have the careers and lives<br>that you had envisioned but to do that<br>you gotta stay connected and it's not<br>easy when you're studying in a distance<br>we fully understand.  Good luck, stay<br>strong, look after yourselves, Kia ora.<br>Kia ora katou. Like me, you're probably sitting at home<br>somewhere, in a corner of your flat, or<br>in a hostel, or tucked away in a spare<br>room somewhere, so I hope you've been<br>able to settle in well and now like all<br>of us beginning to turn your attention<br>to what next.<br>I'm Wendy Larner, I'm the Provost for those of you who don't know<br>me and it's a great pleasure to be able<br>to be part of the discussion and help<br>answer some of the questions that people<br>have submitted to us.<br>We'll all understand that last<br>week was just a mad scramble as we all<br>tried to get ourselves home and get us<br>ourselves safe and that was that the most<br>important thing for all of us and in<br>that context, doing the shift that we're<br>all doing now to being online this new<br>world of mediated communications we knew<br>that was going to take a little bit of<br>time and we knew that there be some<br>troubleshooting that we needed to do<br>that people needed to have devices, they<br>needed to know how to use those devices<br>and they needed some time to get to a<br>point where we could pick up our normal<br>ways of doing things and when we began<br>to think about that and realize that<br>Easter was also on the horizon it just<br>made sense to not add extra pressure in<br>what was already an extraordinarily<br>pressured situation to just give people<br>time to get settled, get sorted, change<br>what needed to be changed in order that<br>when we resumed teaching again, we do so<br>in the best possible way for everyone -<br>staff and students,<br>Well of course, none of us quite know<br>what this is going to involve. Some of<br>you, if you're paying attention to the<br>regular announcements we were giving<br>from Prime Minister and the like, you'll<br>notice that the language has shifted<br>from four weeks to some weeks so we<br>simply don't know quite what we're<br>looking at and whether the lockdown is<br>going to work and what all of that will<br>mean, so in that context we thought it<br>was much better to plan for the rest of<br>the trimester then it was to make a<br>short-term arrangement that we then<br>would have had to have changed again.<br>Well again the shorter answer is we just<br>don't know yet, we're fully focused on<br>trimester one then and giving ourselves<br>to the end of trimester one ensuring<br>that everyone has that best possible<br>experience, again both for staff and<br>students and as we begin to understand<br>in more detail what things are likely to<br>look like in June, then we'll be in a<br>much better place to be making decisions<br>about trimester two.<br>Students with limited internet, I'm one<br>of those, I'm hot spotting from home.<br>We are working on that as a university and<br>indeed I suspect we're working on that<br>as a country in order to ensure that<br>everyone has the access that they need<br>to have.<br>If you are struggling with this<br>do let us know, let your course<br>coordinator know, that's part of the<br>point of the Student Engagement Day is<br>to troubleshoot all those kinds of<br>issues if you don't have a device or if<br>you have limited internet capacity we<br>need to know because then we can think<br>about what the alternatives might look<br>like.<br>So we are, the blackboard has all sorts<br>of material that is available to us that<br>we haven't necessarily used as much in<br>the past as we will now so we'll be very<br>carefully thinking about people's<br>engagement, ensuring that they are able<br>to access the materials that they're<br>able to access that they're able to do<br>the assignments that have been set so<br>we'll be working really hard from our end<br>to make sure no one falls behind but<br>from your end it will be also really<br>important that that you communicate if<br>you're struggling if there are issues as<br>you normally would let your lecturer know, let your tutor know, let your course coordinator know<br>because if we know that<br>there are issues then it's much easier<br>to address them.<br>Well again it's a very similar response to some of my earlier<br>comments we just don't know, we will as<br>is being the case all the way through<br>will be guided by the government<br>officials, we'll be a guided by the<br>guidance that we have around the<br>different alert levels so once we know<br>then we'll be able to communicate with<br>you as we have been doing all the way<br>through so so it is a really tough time<br>you know it is a really uncertain time<br>there are lots of questions that we just<br>don't know the answer to, but as soon as<br>we have answers obviously we'll <br>share those with you.<br>All payments again we don't know yet<br>obviously this is not something that is<br>just about our university this is<br>something that affects all universities.<br>So there are discussions going on more<br>generally about what lockdown might mean<br>for things like hall payments so again as<br>soon as we have some answers we'll let<br>you know what those are.<br>Well firstly and importantly tri 2<br>will start on the day that tri 2 has<br>always been scheduled to start on. We<br>will see closer to the time what that<br>looks like,<br>what alert level the country is at<br>terms of what that will mean for our<br>physical presence or otherwise. But at<br>this stage we expect tri 2 learning<br>whether it's in person or virtually to<br>continue to continue as as normal we've<br>got a little bit more time to think<br>about tri 2 so some of the things that<br>we're doing quite quickly at the moment<br>we'll have lots of learning to bring to<br>bear on tri 2 in terms of the quality<br>of the student experience if it is in if<br>it still continues to be in a more<br>online format.<br>well yes that's exactly why we've given<br>everyone time to make this change to<br>meet this challenge. We are all adjusting<br>and we do understand that and again your<br>course coordinators your lecturers your<br>tutors they'll all work very carefully<br>with you to ensure that you are not<br>disadvantaged by that. So my best wishes<br>to you again just to say this is<br>extraordinary circumstances that there's<br>a big change it is a big challenge for<br>all of us, I'm really proud of how we as<br>a university are rising to this<br>challenge and there'll be lots of things<br>for us to sort out as we work our way<br>through this but I'm sure with a little<br>bit of goodwill and and a lot of<br>patience and a lot of learning we'll get<br>there. So in the meantime kia kaha, stay safe,<br>stay well, and keep learning.<br>Hi my name's Stuart Brock, I'm the Vice<br>Provost Academic and I'm here to answer<br>some of the questions you've been<br>raising about online delivery.<br>Student Engagement day is a day for<br>course coordinators and lecturers to<br>connect briefly with students and to<br>outline what new engagement expectations<br>they have of you as we move from a<br>face-to-face to an online mode of<br>delivery. This will give you as students<br>some degree of certainty about what will<br>happen when teaching recommences on<br>April the 28th.<br>We can't require students to sit in the<br>exam on campus right now so the teaching<br>period has been extended by three weeks<br>but the trimester will end on time as<br>there are no exams so there's no need<br>for a three-week exam period that means<br>there'll be no impact on the one-week<br>mid year break or the start of trimester 2.<br>No student will be required to submit<br>any assessment from now until Thursday<br>April 3rd at the very earliest.<br>Course coordinators are acutely aware of<br>your circumstances and are likely to be<br>very accommodating of any reasonable<br>extension requests that you have. If<br>you're anxious about due dates make sure<br>you approach your course coordinators<br>now they will be understanding.<br>Well it's a break just like any other<br>break although there'll be some<br>exceptions in most courses you'll be<br>able to stop attending any scheduled<br>engagement activities like lectures<br>tutorials or labs nonetheless you should<br>still keep up with readings study and<br>engage with your course materials just<br>as you would in any other break.<br>That will vary from course to course<br>online teaching might involve Panopto<br>video recordings, zoom lectures, or online<br>discussion boards to find out more log<br>on to your blackboard courses and engage<br>with your course coordinators on student<br>engagement day.<br>We all must stay within our bubble<br>potentially all the way through to the<br>end of trimester one consequently we<br>cannot offer traditional exams as a<br>means of assessment, course coordinators<br>at the University along with lecturers<br>across the whole country are working<br>through alternative forms of assessment<br>that can be completed online, you will<br>have clarity around what those<br>alternatives are in the coming weeks and<br>certainty before teaching resumes at the<br>end of the month.<br>We won't be returning to face-to-face<br>delivery of lectures this trimester even<br>if we do go back to alert level two or<br>three in the next four to six weeks. The<br>reason is that we cannot predict when<br>the Government might escalate to level<br>four again in the Wellington region the<br>University needs to be prepared just in<br>case we do, we'll wait and see what we<br>can do in second trimester. But rest<br>assured we will be working to give you<br>the best possible learning experience no<br>matter what constraints we face.<br>We recognize that moving to a new mode<br>of delivery will present us all with<br>challenges students will have to<br>navigate a new way of learning<br>there will be uncertainties about how<br>its assessment and engagement occur<br>plans will have to change or be put on<br>hold and there'll be an intense 9 week<br>period teaching students struggling with<br>these obstacles are encouraged to engage<br>with our support services either by<br>calling 0800 04 04 04 or emailing info@vuw.ac.nz</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
