It's got everything you want.<br>It's got great food, great coffee, great<br>beaches, and ten minutes from the city<br>you can hear no cars and be in the trees.<br>it's got great mountain biking tracks,<br>great walking tracks and the people are<br>super friendly.<br>It's a brilliant city.<br>Everything's so close. The University and<br>in particular, the law faculty is right<br>in the heart of it.<br>You're right next to<br>all the places that feel important for your work,<br>but also you have great access to places<br>you can play as well.<br>Wellington is a really beautiful city.<br>It's literally beautiful and it's got a<br>lot of character to it,  it's got a<br>soul.<br>The fact that you can actually walk<br>everywhere I think it's amazing.<br>There's great restaurants. there's great cafes and<br>bars, there's a really good local music<br>scene in Wellington.<br>It's such a vibrant<br>place for being a relatively small city,<br>and there are a lot of opportunities for<br>a small city.<br>Being in the seat of<br>government and also just being in a<br>really vibrant town.<br>It's like a smaller<br>version of San Francisco I would say.<br>It's got a big city feel to it but<br>that's just kind of condensing like<br>seven blocks.<br>I think because we're so<br>small and we do have this sort of wild<br>city we're all a bit maybe a bit more<br>relaxed about things.<br>You've got people from all<br>walks of life, all races and cultures and<br>I think it's a really valuable thing to<br>hit this big melting pot of all sorts of<br>people that come together especially at<br>the University and you get to learn<br>about a whole lot of different cultures<br>and in different people and different<br>ways of doing things which then changes<br>your perspective on the world it's a<br>beautiful place to live and work.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
