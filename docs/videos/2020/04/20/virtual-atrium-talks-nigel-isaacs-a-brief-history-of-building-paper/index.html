But when, and why, did building paper start to be used? How has the paper and its use changed over time?<br><br>This talk will present work in progress exploring the origins of building paper, which forms part of a lager research project exploring the history building technologies.<br><br>The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation’s Virtual Atrium Talks are a series of seminars where staff, PhD students, and external design and built environment practitioners present their current research and seek feedback from the community.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

how what<br>are the reasons behind them I do want to<br>stress that this is work in progress<br>although my facts may be right some of<br>the interpretations may change and some<br>of the way I put the text together may<br>change so over the next few weeks I've<br>enforced solitude and I hope I'm going<br>to turn this into a more useful paper<br>the picture on the right actually comes<br>from the origins of building paper and<br>we're going to seeing a bit more of it<br>as we go through the presentation when<br>we think about what is that the standard<br>the house we expect it actually if you<br>take the lining out look something a bit<br>like this this is the plaque smilk<br>shared and the Amuro part of a the<br>heritage new zealand category one clacks<br>mil and it's pretty obvious you can see<br>the light from outside and that light<br>brings with it wind this is a house that<br>was investigated by a miryo Keith and<br>heritage solutions the occupants of that<br>which fortunately had sacking lining had<br>attempted to keep the wind out which<br>blew through the cracks in the strip<br>materials and she was able to date the<br>house from the illustrations of the<br>magazine that had been used with it but<br>in simple terms strip materials are the<br>sort of weird weather board or cladding<br>that we have on the outside<br>coupled with the then traditional<br>sacking on the inside meant that the<br>outside wind could quite easily get<br>inside there was a growth of<br>understanding around the 1860s in<br>America that newspaper was a very good<br>nonconductor a good insulator that<br>reduced the flow of heat and so people<br>started using the newspaper as ways to<br>reduce heat loss and of course wrapping<br>fish-and-chip<br>which is by far the most important thing<br>you can do with it so when we go to the<br>up close oxford english dictionary we<br>find that what was originally called<br>sheathing paper which is something you<br>think of a sheath for a knife or a sword<br>it's it's something that in cases<br>something else and the first reference<br>to it that the oxford english dictionary<br>had dates to 1794 when an article they<br>talked about writing and printing paper<br>sheathing wrapping paper building paper<br>evolved from that and I'll show you<br>training presentation how but it was<br>originally a heavy paper used by<br>builders as a covering or lining<br>material and the first reference to that<br>came in 1873 when building paper was in<br>its youth as part of my research I've<br>actually managed to find some slightly<br>earlier references Alexander Hamilton's<br>report on manufactures in the United<br>States which of those days really meant<br>the East Coast took that sheathing paper<br>was necessary for military supply and<br>shipbuilding he was actually talking<br>about not taxing it whereas who's happy<br>to text other papers<br>whereas building paper has its first<br>formal out outing as part of the Rock<br>River pate Rock River paper companies<br>hatin building paper circular although<br>the term had been used in newspapers in<br>1869 referring to the Rock River<br>companies material I want to make one<br>more slight digression and that is how<br>tar and paper got linked together<br>because that is critical in<br>understanding the story of building<br>paper in 1774 the first German mention<br>of the use of tart and building paper or<br>paper together to form a roofing where<br>it provided the opportunity to have a<br>flat roof was then possibly covering the<br>sand or gravel but certainly by 1839 the<br>hulls ornamental a wood cement based<br>roofing was a use the barrel making<br>pitch witches where the wood part of it<br>comes from and it was covered with sand<br>and gravel this allowed the use of a<br>wide flat roof and hence supported the<br>evolution the development of modernism<br>with its use of flat or slightly pitched<br>roofs 1844 is reportedly the first u.s.<br>use of a painter impregnated wood and<br>wood pitch roof copied from wood<br>construction in a small town on the<br>Atlantic coast by 1867 twenty-three<br>years later the report said that it<br>abounded with specimens of pasteboard<br>for roofing and lining rooms with<br>pressure providing bituminous cotton B<br>pier which if I understand correctly is<br>the use of a pepper mache material made<br>to look like stone or metal as well as<br>passwords and other route paper Faru<br>'then the austrians also had bituminous<br>and incombustible<br>and impermeable roofing papers exhibited<br>by a number of manufacturers 1867 is a<br>very important year in the life of<br>building paper it was when a number of<br>things started to come together the<br>1830s had seen the invention of the<br>furred greener paper making machine<br>in America that suffered suffered<br>through the civil war ending about 1865<br>by 1866 or 67 the ground would process<br>was in the States 1867 the sulphate<br>process was invisible it took really<br>until the 1880s for wide commercial use<br>but in late 1860's in Wisconsin they had<br>a number of things they had straw raw<br>material for straw board they had power<br>in the form of the river going nearby<br>and I've already mentioned The Rock<br>River and we have an introduction to<br>that River and later of course they had<br>steam driven by wood or coal they had<br>the technology to convert straw to a<br>fiber the soda process which was a<br>previous history of the sulphate process<br>and somewhat gentler on everyone they<br>had the technology they had this<br>machines to make heavy paper and paste<br>wood they had transport they had a way<br>for the railways to move it the market<br>and of course that the the canals and<br>the rivers could be used for shipping<br>they had a purpose they had a lot of<br>houses with what they called clapboards<br>what we call weather board with the<br>sacking inside the drafts came through<br>as I've already pointed out and of<br>course they had the invention of<br>extensive advertising the ability to<br>create a market and promote the product<br>so surprise surprise in 1868 the bullet<br>beloit straw board company and the Rocky<br>River Paper Company merged together<br>forming the Rock River Paper Company and<br>the company as in the fount one of the<br>founders the Berwick straw board company<br>made straw boards made a lot of it uh<br>and they they made this as a sheathing<br>or as a cladding board and a roofing<br>board it was described as course yellow<br>tasteful it perhaps not unsurprising<br>from straw enrolls 32 inches point eight<br>of a meter to 48 inches or 1.2 meters<br>wide very compact and firm with a<br>straight smooth edge and weighing about<br>got a pounds for square yard 611 grams<br>per square meter modern building paper<br>is a hundred two hundred and fifty grams<br>per square meter or for compare us to<br>the paper we use in our photocopy<br>machines is of the order of 80 grams per<br>square meter so you can see this is a<br>heavy board its purpose to create warmer<br>timber-frame buildings but it wasn't the<br>paper board we think of the building<br>paper we think of this was a board<br>effectively used as the cladding<br>material it just went on the outside or<br>if you preferred on the inside of the<br>building it continued the use of green<br>timber it meant that the strong and<br>chilly Prairie went Prairie winds were<br>stopped they didn't get inside the house<br>it was compact solid and had most<br>importantly a very low price it was far<br>cheaper then the putting clapboards or<br>with the woods on the outside and a<br>sacking on the inside the Rock River<br>Paper Company had a wide range of ideas<br>and things developed and their directors<br>and agents over basically two or three<br>years produced a large number of patents<br>these are that the most important ones<br>the first one from Merrill who was the<br>president of the company developed the<br>machine that made the paper or the board<br>that came in out of it much drier by<br>pressing it between rollers Evans then<br>took this and tired it directly which<br>made it both waterproof and flammable<br>but that's other advantage was it kept<br>the rats and mice AK didn't like the<br>smell mr. Benjamin fields were being<br>with the Boyd strong company produced a<br>patent for a fabric to cover rubes and<br>the science of buildings this is the one<br>paint might have not actually seen I've<br>seen references to it but it appears to<br>be missing from the US Patent Office<br>database mural produced to pay a patent<br>for the rolled straw board this is in<br>some ways what the Rock River Paper<br>Company claimed to be the<br>greatest invention we'll come back to it<br>in a minute field and Smith produced a<br>roofing based on this product using<br>bitumen and silica to saturate it and<br>create a less valuable product mr. Cobb<br>added to this a layer of sand and gravel<br>perhaps the the ancestor of the modern<br>American flat roof which nowadays tends<br>to be more made of butanol rather than<br>paper and then mr. Hale who will come<br>back too late for was the New York agent<br>for the company designed improved<br>sheathing boards that built on murals<br>rolled straw board on the right we've<br>got Hales paper product patent<br>illustration showing where this amazing<br>product could be used throughout the<br>house and then the rock river company<br>paper company started to promote it<br>they put out an annual circular and I've<br>been very fortunate to find three copies<br>of their circular the 1869 the first one<br>and it says inside it's the first one<br>which the Canadian Centre for active<br>cares the 1870 the one in the middle the<br>winterfell library had a copy and lastly<br>the 1877 the Lincoln Presidential<br>Library had a copy and I was even more<br>fortunate to have a colleague in<br>Springfield Illinois who went in and<br>took copies of it for me<br>and you can see the picture in the<br>center here that was on my early slide<br>this is the house that they used to<br>promote their sales although after eight<br>years they've gone to a much more<br>sophisticated house instead of just<br>being a simple what looks to be two up<br>two down they've gone to her a much more<br>um decorative an an impressive house and<br>you'll notice that the they go from<br>having one mill and the base of 13<br>Marcel Street in Chicago to having two<br>mills and was Lloyd and Marshall<br>Michigan and they still had their two<br>mills but now they've moved to much<br>bigger premises by 1877 plus their<br>patented red cedar carpet line<br>which was made at the same Factory and<br>use cedar board for its properties anti<br>insect properties where did this<br>invention really come from losses<br>Merrill's illustration on the left from<br>his patent and I I have to say I cannot<br>see the difference between the two<br>illustrations but I'm sure there must be<br>some there according to their 1870<br>circular they received an order an 18 in<br>spring 1868 so I guess that's about this<br>time of year for ten tons of straw<br>boards four to four point three meters<br>long for cheese boxes they couldn't make<br>it that long and transport it so they<br>suggested rolling it but how did you<br>roll it and so they decided the way to<br>do it was to roll or to start the<br>rolling of the board as it came out on a<br>large cylinder so very quickly they<br>ended up with a process that would allow<br>them to make very long lengths of a<br>board clearly there's a limited market<br>for cheese boxes and according to the<br>company I wanna stress this is their<br>story they decide it would be good to<br>cover the sides of buildings but instead<br>of having a a product that that just<br>laid over they decided to make it as<br>wide as the studs and it became the<br>thing this was going to keep houses warm<br>so they also invented a this is Evans<br>again member of the committee of a<br>company invented a way of putting<br>indented grooves down the side of the<br>board so you could put in side the<br>building and this is so the outside of<br>the building is here you've got you you<br>bought your sheathing board here a dead<br>air space here and then of course you've<br>got your lath and plaster cover it or<br>alternatively you could put it on the<br>outside right what I find interesting<br>about this illustration is you'll see<br>that they are using<br>what now would be plywood but then they<br>used a a strip board to provide an<br>external cladding and then over the top<br>of that they put the weather board well<br>they were very successful and the<br>picture in my in the background is this<br>map taken from the circulars showing how<br>they grew in 1865 their testimonials<br>came from this area going around<br>Wisconsin Illinois Michigan by 1870 they<br>were well and truly stretched out and<br>going much further distances alone New<br>Yorkers just outside here by 1877<br>they're going out here um they didn't<br>always increase the number of<br>testimonials but what they did say is<br>it's gone to Hudson's Bay in the north<br>the Gulf on the south the Atlantic east<br>in the Pacific West so by 1877 roughly<br>eight years after this product had been<br>invented it was being used throughout<br>the entire United States other people in<br>boy were also making building paper if<br>in Davis or Francis Davis had three<br>patents but his most important was he<br>treated it with El Elam or potassium<br>aluminium sulfate or aluminum sulfate<br>which made it fireproof and by 1879<br>we're talking two years after that<br>illustration from the rock rocky Rock<br>River company he had factories in<br>Cologne pressure and a London England<br>1875 he changed his name and the<br>company's name and a Chicago ancient was<br>Barrett Arnold and Kimball which later<br>became the Barrett division of honey<br>Rowland company continuing to make<br>building paper further inventions were<br>happening around the building paper line<br>Attleboro Massachusetts sisal craft was<br>invented a layer of Kraft paper<br>ash felt wrote a sisal fibre which<br>should say a little bit like the fiber<br>we get from New Zealand native flecks<br>and then another layer of craft and ash<br>felt a similar product below lacking the<br>air shot was Cabot's quilt and paper you<br>grass paper product<br>few years later in the was used to<br>installation size of crafts came from<br>the paper products company a man called<br>Charles Howard was the principal<br>inventor but by the 1920s George Gibbs<br>was developing much improved machines<br>and ways of making it some people may<br>know the name second or Gustus second I<br>also invented a paper product but he had<br>a three ply product a paper felt paper<br>product he painted the product and the<br>machine and it was available in New<br>Zealand 1888 just four years after that<br>machine had been painted of course he<br>was really well known press 1894<br>plasterboard patent or second board<br>which became available in New Zealand in<br>the early 1900s the okaybut humanist<br>building company also used a ply a<br>multiple ply product but they tried<br>saturating the paper with silicon of<br>soda to make it non inflammable and then<br>painted a number of machines and ways of<br>achieving this the paper production was<br>such that building paper which is the<br>red dots here starts very small<br>unfortunately or fortunately it didn't<br>start getting into these statistics<br>until 1890 remember we're inventing this<br>1869 so 20 years later it's actually big<br>enough to be in the statistics and this<br>here at my the bars in the background of<br>the percentage of the building paper as<br>part of the song I'm just being hassled<br>which is part of the percentage of<br>building papers of the total market<br>which remained of the order of four to<br>five percent over this period and you<br>can see here total paper production is<br>growing but so is building paper why is<br>building paper growing or perhaps that<br>comes in this story which is the amount<br>of money they're getting paid even<br>during the Depression building paper was<br>getting good value for money so that it<br>was a profitable product for the mills<br>to make and sell<br>I want to end with just a quick review<br>of what was happening in New Zealand<br>the earliest advertising I found so far<br>is 1888 but in the early 1900's a number<br>of patent trademarks were made 1941 we<br>have the jury company building it smell<br>food factory in Oni honey it took until<br>1944 to get this into the building code<br>1964 continued 1978 it continued and<br>nowadays it is still in there although<br>its purpose has changed hugely from what<br>it was originally invented for it was<br>originally invented to keep the wind out<br>now it's part of the moisture management<br>we have in our buildings when I started<br>this exercise I thought this would be<br>the family tree of building paper it<br>would start with sheathing which became<br>plywood sheathing widely used in America<br>it would it would beget building paper<br>which become tire and fire resistant<br>which in turn would beget building reps<br>and we get the synthetic rats in fact<br>the family tree looks more like this but<br>she thing continues as plywood but<br>building paper entire and fire resistant<br>paper are almost the same time and the<br>building reps follow-on from that so<br>there's some interesting work yet to be<br>done on creating this family tree for<br>the future I want to look at the<br>locations of hydropower the patent<br>review the different types of paper<br>types and the innovations they were<br>making so there I think it's time for me<br>to finish and just acknowledge the<br>people have helped and open it up to<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
