In this brief presentation Regan outlines the development of a thermal drone capability based around the ongoing research that such a tool has or allows.<br><br>That work started out looking at ways to find sub surface water (approximately 5 metres under ground) in humanitarian situations. But then quickly expanded to include roof conditioning studies for Heritage NZ on the Old (Wooden) Govt Building (Summer Scholar work by Tatianna Ermenyi, together with Nigel Isaac and Wallace Enegbuma), the historic Orakau Pa site in te Awamutu (Paul Meredith from the PVM office) and at Regan’s whanau urupā at te Ore Ore in Masterton.<br><br>The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation’s Virtual Atrium Talks are a series of seminars where staff, PhD students, and external design and built environment practitioners present their current research and seek feedback from the community.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we got to talk about the well not talk<br>about the development of the stem or<br>drunk PC at the School of Architecture<br>now beckon Twiggy will lecture was late<br>2016<br>I I was granted some you Aria funding to<br>look at drones in humanitarian aid and<br>anyway there were three there are three<br>parts to it it was turned into<br>absolutely spectacular outcomes and<br>teams of the drone mapping that we did<br>with the United Nations up in Bangladesh<br>which they hadn't been able to do before<br>surprisingly so that was rather<br>spectacular during the 2017-2018 year<br>the third one was to look at building or<br>mine axis of penetration and that was<br>following on from Christchurch where we<br>had a lot of issues about going back<br>into buildings in the post-disaster<br>phases I can remember well trying to get<br>the papa Dada for my time out of<br>their building and even though all of us<br>are signing documents saying that we<br>understood the risks involved we we<br>still couldn't get access into that<br>building and so things like the Basilica<br>where they the sacrificial drawing of<br>sealer then we wanted to make sure that<br>when the earthquake hit ranked him that<br>we were understood about how to get<br>drive-ins into those building but also<br>out what we were in a protocol for those<br>for that sort of drone work but what I<br>want to talk about today is the third<br>one which was locating subsurface water<br>yeah any humanitarian area water does<br>well the key aspects and so druk bones<br>rather than just being something that<br>spectacularly provides photographs and<br>videos we're trying and all of us work<br>here to use drones to do something<br>beyond just the video and those great<br>photographs and in locating the<br>subsurface water it's really trying to<br>find out where we're and if you're given<br>a site in a human and humanitarian<br>context how<br>can I find water yeah most of the time<br>we have to use quite sophisticated<br>recent ability studies or seismic<br>studies to try and figure out where<br>those without water is local folk<br>normally have a feel or an understanding<br>from the growth patterns that are in<br>those areas but being able to go into a<br>fairly barren area and being able to<br>find water is and I'm talking about<br>subsurface water around about five<br>meters down so that you could dig wells<br>was the kind of you know kind of thing<br>that we're looking for<br>so we started out looking at various<br>options and various ways and to do this<br>now I've been involved with drones for<br>quite a while and in fact and 2010 we<br>took one into the Haitian the earthquake<br>in Haiti and we were able to drone up<br>all of the valleys these these values<br>and all the rubbish that collected and<br>every you know some of that flush out<br>and so there'd be a big turn of rubbish<br>and so we had to go up through the<br>valleys to map them to figure out where<br>the retaining walls are going and we did<br>that with drones quite quite or very<br>successfully that was their connect and<br>then we use them in Christchurch with<br>with the Christchurch earthquakes useful<br>in Afghanistan where we were looking at<br>a mapping of the housing in some of the<br>housing designs and from that 2014<br>experience I'm probably were the only<br>drone I don't want to use the word<br>pilots but one of the drone people who's<br>ever flown a drone with a military drone<br>overhead which was not lost on the<br>villager that I was sort of getting<br>permission to fly over the in village<br>with because we could hear that the non<br>stealthy diesel drugs that is they come<br>across you can hear them anyway then<br>back in the Philippines with Yolanda and<br>2015 and Vanuatu and also in 2015-2016<br>we took them into kaikoura<br>trying to find some of the sort of air<br>power that had collapsed downhill<br>science and then the big one in 2017<br>with Bangladesh and<br>the sort of complex emergency trying to<br>map the land that we're moving 1.1<br>million people into so overall I've had<br>simple card I brought C 146 long drone<br>flights since I started making a log<br>back in 2013 so for me it was straight<br>away going to be a drone drone so the<br>vehicle that I was going to use partly<br>because of this experience but also<br>because you know we have a choice<br>between a fixed-wing or rotary basically<br>whether it's a quad or helicopter versus<br>whether it's and a plane sort of<br>standard drone that we often think about<br>all you often see the military type<br>drones the the fixed-wing drones have a<br>much longer range and a much longer time<br>whereas the quads and the call the<br>rotary ones are quads and helicopters<br>pinned here at they're very short in<br>terms of time but for a lot of the sites<br>that we're doing and if we manage them<br>correctly we can actually cover quite a<br>large area so that the area advantage of<br>sort of fixed-wing drones is not really<br>there um and then why were there more<br>cameras well I thought rather than that<br>rather than some you know talk about how<br>thermal cameras measure different<br>spectra outside of the light spectra but<br>I kind of show you behind the computer<br>that you're watching me on is the wall<br>of my work from home which you can see<br>there it looks there's nothing<br>particularly unusual tip that's kind of<br>a little bit miss Yogi's<br>it's nothing particularly unusual about<br>this wall until you start putting a<br>thermal camera on it now when you put a<br>very low risk thermal camera this is the<br>one that's on wired phone you can start<br>see that the stunts and the diagonal<br>stud in the wall behind us then becomes<br>quite apparent and you can see that flew<br>over left the kind of outline of the<br>picture but you can sort of also see<br>because it's not so accurate that there<br>is quite<br>large well there's discrepancies the<br>main theme of the picture is the year<br>that there is you know studs in a<br>diagonal bracing stud in the wall behind<br>me and but when you get to something<br>that's a bit more finer in terms of the<br>pixels this one's a Fleur view pro<br>camera that which is the one that we<br>finally got long story but no that<br>another you know another presentation on<br>that one I guess but you can start to<br>see that there's a lot more detail so in<br>that first one that first demo camera<br>it's a 80 by 60 Lee important sort of<br>camera and then in the in the second one<br>it's a 640 by 520 or 512 sorry Town -<br>camera so you can see that you know the<br>thermal cameras fishing they give us a<br>lot of information about what's in<br>things that we can't normally see or<br>defeat and these are very small<br>temperature gradients that were<br>measuring at 2.1 of a degree different<br>so the cameras can pick up those small<br>differences and they give us quite a<br>different take on what we're looking at<br>yeah this wall at the back of my room<br>for instance so they were the sort of<br>there was the sort of reasoning behind<br>the fiercely of using drones rather than<br>fixed wings but also the the need to<br>have thermal cameras because when we<br>were looking at trying to find water we<br>were trying to look at the temperature<br>differentials across the ground so<br>obviously we needed quite an accurate<br>camera and then 640 by 512 camera that<br>you see on your right was getting quite<br>very difficult to obtain because we have<br>to sign special special agreements not<br>to take that into areas where it could<br>be stolen or taken because it has quite<br>a high and military vanity because it's<br>quite small now<br>try something instantly devastating now<br>and I'm gonna try and stop the<br>presentation and try and go back to back<br>to where in here yeah<br>back to back to here in the room because<br>I just wanted to show you some of the<br>stuff that we've got just to give you an<br>idea of what we're talking about as we<br>go through so to start off with this is<br>the Train here it's a it's a beauty it's<br>there mitrice heavy lift drone are<br>really large really big really quite<br>scary<br>looks very military very tactical and<br>this is the drain that we started out<br>using for our first sort of attempts at<br>thermal droning it had a few problems<br>and we'll talk about those later later<br>on we've got a lot more compact down to<br>down to this one which is the merit Pro<br>a lovely workhorse drone both of them by<br>DGI<br>yeah they seem to be the maker of choice<br>these days I guess but this never it was<br>one that we were able to adopt and a<br>death by bolting pitching a plate on the<br>bottom like that and then attaching the<br>camera camera like I showed you just<br>before this one here teaching that to<br>the drone underneath her so I was<br>pointing down and so at the end of the<br>day that was the Sun drying that we<br>ended up with but I wanted to show you<br>what it looked like but also to show you<br>the sort of size and scale of the sorts<br>of things that we're working with now I<br>want to get back into showing you back<br>to the presentation because I'm on the<br>way<br>because I guess a lot of my work is is<br>application based out of my research is<br>the application based yeah I came across<br>when we came ran into the cyclists<br>this issue with my own father up in<br>Macedon now with our own herb path and<br>at URI in Macedon andum this is the<br>European ously and its location in<br>Madison just as just we east of Massa on<br>the way to Castle point the riot is up<br>here and what have happened with us for<br>a part is that someone had gone and<br>buried their relative in what we've what<br>was considered the roadway and so we<br>couldn't actually get to the back of<br>them rock back of the ear path because<br>of it but we also knew that seat in<br>between there were bodies buried from<br>the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic during<br>that time people it was a it was a rush<br>to get people into graves they were dug<br>hastily and it's very similar to the<br>scenes that we're seeing probably<br>overseas was what happened back in 102<br>years near beckon and ambassador but<br>also all over the country that Mary were<br>were badly impacted by the Spanish flu<br>so I think there's a living point eleven<br>times more fatalities with Mary anywhere<br>with nan Mary so it took a real hit back<br>in 1918 where we didn't have a lockdown<br>provisions that we have today which is<br>basically everyone would just have to<br>look after themselves and the result was<br>a huge sort of impact thanks so huge<br>there it was the numbers that you look<br>at based on the numbers that they have<br>it was four times the Italian impact so<br>we were we the impact on Mary back in<br>eighteen was four times what's happening<br>now in covert nineteen in Italy so it<br>was a really bad situation now the air<br>powers are sort of you know it's not<br>really a it's just a little side<br>Oh to the side down to the down to the<br>bed so I said to my I found out and<br>here's a sort of picture of it from you<br>know courtesy of Google Earth as good as<br>I can get unfortunately we'll talk a<br>little bit about that so this was the<br>graveyard where all my relatives my mum<br>and fathers and brothers all bury here<br>and uncles and auntie's are all buried<br>here and this is where I will also be<br>buried one day when it comes my intent<br>to depart and so we put the thermal<br>drone up with the big mitrice and we<br>started to see some interesting<br>anomalies though it was quite hard to<br>get them and I've spent hours dredging<br>through all the video to sort of get the<br>actual photographs because it was quite<br>tricky to get a thermal drone you've<br>gotta remember we're in the middle of<br>middle of the night because we're<br>anticipating that the temperatures would<br>be only kind of ambient late in the<br>evening early morning so at that time we<br>didn't really know what type of drawing<br>up so this is like 2 a.m. in the morning<br>I'm in a cemetery with my relatives in<br>you know and and my wife Florence and my<br>good friend<br>Frances Abbott and say and then we<br>suddenly you know try to take the memory<br>carrier and ping and we lose it<br>somewhere in the cemetery so it's not<br>the greatest of things there's always a<br>conversation stop when people say well<br>what did you do Regan over the weekend<br>that so well is out looking for the dead<br>bodies and we did find them because when<br>you look closely at these thermal<br>pictures you can see that there is an<br>area there we're the graves are showing<br>up and a thermal camera the bounder<br>picked these up very neatly<br>so see was it we actually we're walking<br>over at least two graves anyway with a<br>road but they're about eight eight<br>graves here they're about another three<br>on the other side that we also picked up<br>we're not quite sure whether they were<br>1918 Spanish flu epidemic but what's<br>interesting and we also found a stream<br>and going through these can sort of see<br>they're going through the cold attack of<br>water in the stream path<br>yeah what's interesting is when we<br>compare the numbers so we we had at<br>least eight potentially eleven and<br>according to the official numbers the<br>married it's in Massillon County were<br>eight all together so we know straight<br>away that the numbers that the head for<br>the best were wrong but even based on<br>those numbers we were talking between<br>about something like eleven point four<br>times the non-park cow and on your nan<br>Mary rate of death and we're talking<br>we're looking at four times the current<br>probe at nineteen ray<br>obvious now that was just on invitation<br>from my fart out but and we have been<br>talking about extending us because many<br>people have now have been asking me<br>about whether we could use this thermal<br>drone in other you know summer<br>circumstances throughout the wire<br>wrapper where they hit hardly very<br>people and you know some of the research<br>that we will be looking at now in this<br>curve in nineteen is the resilience and<br>how people have responded to that to<br>their Spanish flu epidemic 102 years ago<br>and what has actually happened where we<br>need what paths has you know have people<br>taken it's a little bit of a personal<br>trip because I'm always and not so<br>embarrassed about the word right with<br>but I can't sleep Mary and the Heritage<br>that I have we came out of a strong need<br>to own we will not say beaten and just<br>that was actually really pushed hard by<br>our grandfather that we had to have all<br>learn English first because that was the<br>language we were you know we would you<br>know in him and so that was one of the<br>outcomes of that sort of Spanish flu in<br>1918 yeah for me recedes beyond here<br>you've been running deep bodies down it<br>down it down with your phony own I said<br>you yes we have and say he said we'll<br>look we've got this interesting issue up<br>hurt or a cape are in Kiki which is just<br>outside town looting apparently back in<br>1864 there was the one I understand was<br>the last battle of the Waikato Wars and<br>they still weren't quite sure exactly<br>where the past site wirelessly as I<br>understand that the land was confiscated<br>after the battle and then the then it<br>was just given over to farming and it's<br>been farmed since their time although<br>they do now have a a understanding or<br>treaty for this land with this heritage<br>New Zealand and but they're still and<br>it's not quite clear we're<br>the 1864 power site was best estimates<br>you know showing us sort of they think<br>it's somewhere around about here which<br>means that this area here we've learned<br>from our early ones with with the Europe<br>are beckoned to Rory to actually met the<br>area well before we actually go in so we<br>actually had to map so we knew that this<br>area in here would be an area of concern<br>or interest where we could possibly be<br>we should be focusing on the tranche ich<br>we know some of those assumptions were<br>xB about where the power was we were<br>create yeah our first attempts weird<br>very good misses with the big mitrice we<br>had the problems of trying to keep it<br>stable and trying to get the camera<br>pointed down directly down because it<br>was tooth was moving too fast or too<br>quickly it was very difficult and late<br>at night again to try and get it exactly<br>over things we couldn't make sure do the<br>flight planning very well and but what<br>we really noticed and what we picked up<br>later on was that the grass and this<br>area was much longer then we thought<br>that might be why we didn't pick up<br>there any temperature differences on the<br>ground and so we waited till they'd be a<br>the grass had been harvested and we hear<br>it's a second go and trying to find<br>we're the part we're that or okay Pam<br>might be on the site again new to the<br>same site this the time of the grass cut<br>and they'll seeking the team yeah Andy<br>I'm sick of the team we've started to<br>get a lot more pattern and you can sort<br>of see here there's sort of color<br>differentials between it between the two<br>so the darker ones are probably where<br>you're getting water storage and the<br>lighter ones are we're that we're<br>getting free drainage it's flowing away<br>from so it does seem that this the are<br>some areas there if the Mary trust were<br>to excavate this area through here<br>would be a key area to start with and we<br>can actually outline the mark that area<br>if they wanted to but this is the report<br>that has sweater<br>oh you pull you know in terms of what<br>are we doing next but it was quite<br>interesting and it was quite an eerie<br>feeling I remember when I was drowning<br>you know particularly the sight I could<br>always feel the 300-pound re that died<br>at the power or nearby sort of 10 got a<br>shoulder when we were drowning trying to<br>find them out of this this this area so<br>there was there was really quite quite<br>well I'm quite studying on guessing it<br>since but quite yet to be proven but we<br>do know the temperature differentials<br>and we do know where the temperature<br>areas our than their their area which<br>has been farmed since 1864 finally<br>more recently together with our summer<br>scholar team we've been looking at the<br>old wooden government building by this<br>time we developed the drone from a big<br>bulky mitrice which is fabulous a drone<br>with himself<br>fabulous platform we can put almost<br>eating on it and we'll take it up down<br>to a very lightweight barrack which we<br>could control hidden you know great<br>controller so we were quite comfortable<br>when we came to look at the roof the<br>Heritage New Zealand had asked us to<br>look at the condition on the roof and<br>one of the things we needed to know was<br>the leaks we do a whole lot of other<br>studies both inside and outside and one<br>of them was a thermal met of the roof<br>area there remember we've just across<br>the road from Parliament so I was<br>expecting all sorts of all sorts of<br>issues from people with little things in<br>the air trying to ever talk to me about<br>the meaning of life but surprisingly no<br>we didn't do it the whole time we just<br>had to let the hospital helicopter no<br>creams wharf helicopter no and we were<br>basically you know reading fly alone we<br>deliberately stayed very low<br>thirty or thirty-five meters over the<br>old wooden government building so that<br>we didn't get you know didn't raise<br>suspicions it was quite interesting so<br>with us tool we were able to pick out as<br>you can see there's an early morning<br>thermal run across the front part of the<br>a wooden government building that me<br>certainly the ridges were showing up as<br>being<br>areas that that were warmer these hot<br>areas here's just the sun's just coming<br>through and just breaking through onto<br>the roof so we picked up about that we<br>picked up about the areas around the<br>chimneys and these are not actually real<br>Chinese they were taken out as part of<br>the seismic strengthening but these<br>flashings around all the chimneys seem<br>to have lifted up and wither and they<br>are potentially a leak or a weak point<br>within the roof together with the sort<br>of eaves or so the at the top and there<br>were some other areas within some of the<br>valleys where we've picked up leaks<br>which have also been shown up inside so<br>we've come quite a long way from sort of<br>you know late 2016<br>I still have to do the the survey to try<br>and find water for you know subsurface<br>water we're still going to do that we've<br>got all the gear we're just going to<br>find the site and also find the time<br>which is also which is what we're always<br>fighting against isn't it but and I<br>chose this topic over some of the other<br>ones that I wanted to do mostly because<br>and this is the sort of take-home<br>message that I really wanted to get to<br>was that the work that we've been doing<br>or have done just we'll just touched on<br>I guess up with the with my father from<br>the war effort on the 1918 Spanish flu<br>epidemic I don't think they had pandemic<br>you know so he's a hippie gimmick even<br>though we were impacted 11 times more<br>than non-maori<br>and four times more than the Komen 19<br>italian response we came through and i<br>think that's a fabulous message for<br>these times is that when we will come<br>: 19 what's out the other side we're<br>still not quite sure yet was still him<br>do we get out and his head impacts on on<br>us my wife are now my Mary and Mary<br>relative like is which we are still<br>mapping and trying to understand how<br>that resilience will take shape<br>certainly his Elin will not be the same<br>when we start potentially opening up<br>when the block down the level for comes<br>off in about a week's time hopefully all<br>fingers crossed and I thought that was a<br>good a good message to have together<br>with the kind of Applied Research that I<br>get up to sometimes most of the time I<br>guess it is it's mostly applied research<br>that I'm doing but and I thought that<br>was just a really great message for us</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
