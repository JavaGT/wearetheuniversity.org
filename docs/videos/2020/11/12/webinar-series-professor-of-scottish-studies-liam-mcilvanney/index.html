and keep my<br>introductory remarks quite brief<br>so just to put the book into some kind<br>of context the quaker<br>is my third novel my first two novels<br>all the colors of the town and where the<br>dead men go<br>these levels were political fillers with<br>a contemporary setting<br>featuring the investigative journalist<br>jerry conway<br>as the protagonist and i conceived this<br>the conway books as a trilogy but i then<br>got a little bit bored<br>with my central character and<br>so i've kind of left it hanging as a<br>two-book trilogy<br>and sort of moved on to two different<br>things<br>so the novel that i'm speaking about<br>today<br>the quaker is i suppose a historical<br>thriller and set in glasgow in 1969<br>around the time of the the real life<br>bible john<br>murders and it's a sort of loose<br>fictionalization<br>of of those murders and<br>the scenario is that it's glasgow in<br>1969<br>um my protagonist is<br>d.i duncan mccormick who as it happens<br>is a gay<br>catholic highland flying squad detective<br>and he's tasked with reviewing<br>uh the faltering investigation into a<br>serial killer in glasgow so three<br>um murders have been committed um<br>there hasn't been a murderer in a number<br>of months and<br>the top brass are looking to wind down<br>the investigation<br>and because it's such a high profile<br>case um they can't simply close it down<br>they need to go through<br>a procedure and this is where duncan<br>mccormick comes in but what happens is<br>that<br>uh just as he finishes writing his<br>report a fourth murderer<br>takes place and suddenly instead of<br>winding the investigation down<br>mccormick is suddenly part of the<br>investigative team<br>and has to work alongside colleagues who<br>up until now have regarded him as a bit<br>of a a ton coat of grass if you like<br>that's one strand of the plot um a<br>second strand<br>features a character called alex peyton<br>who is um in in the vernacular of my<br>hometown what we would call a peterman<br>uh what would you what you would<br>probably call a safe blower a jugger<br>and uh this character alex baker is<br>based in london<br>and he returns to glasgow to conduct<br>uh a major heist in the city<br>and as you might imagine those two plot<br>lines intersect<br>as the novel progresses um<br>i might talk a bit about the historical<br>background<br>to the book because as i say it's based<br>on<br>a real-life historical series of crimes<br>the so-called bible john murders and to<br>someone who grew up in the west of<br>scotland in the 1970s and 80s as i did<br>um the words bible drawn had quite a<br>special resonance<br>you might overhear your parents talking<br>in guarded voices about bible john<br>or you might overhear bigger kids in the<br>playground discussing these murders that<br>took place<br>in the big bad city across the fennec<br>moore 20 miles away<br>the mortals took place in glasgow in<br>1968 and 1969 there were three<br>murders in each case the victim was<br>picked up<br>in the barrowland ballroom which is<br>quite a rough dance hall<br>in the east end of the city they were<br>then<br>raped strangled and dumped within a few<br>hundred yards of their homes and the<br>three victims lived<br>in very different quarters of the city<br>um battlefield in the south side<br>out east in bridgton and out west in<br>scottsdale and there was no direct<br>connection<br>between the victims although they shared<br>a physical type they were all<br>brunettes and petite<br>they all had young children two of them<br>were separated or divorced<br>from their husbands and a third had a<br>husband who was<br>and there was a kind of queasy<br>presbyterian moralist<br>much of the commentary on these murders<br>you know what were these women doing out<br>levanting when they had kiddies at home<br>as if there was some kind of grim<br>calvinist karma<br>in their deaths the killer's never<br>caught<br>and this was quite surprising because<br>the police knew a great deal about<br>bible john the sister of the third<br>victim shared uh well in fact spent an<br>evening in bible john's company in the<br>barland ballroom<br>and then she had a taxi with him on the<br>way back to<br>scottsdale in the west end of the city<br>so she was able to give the police quite<br>a detailed description<br>of the killer and so they knew they knew<br>a great deal about him and he was tall<br>he had fair reddish hair worn<br>unfashionably short he was well spoken<br>he dressed smartly in a three-button<br>brown<br>chalk stripe suit and he was<br>scrupulously polite he wore a regimental<br>tie<br>a wristwatch with a thick leather strap<br>he had distinctive overlapping teeth<br>and he also spoke in biblical cadences<br>and ranted about dens of iniquity and<br>women taken in adultery<br>and this was where the bible john<br>nickname<br>was coined um so the police had<br>a range of clues and they blitzed those<br>clues<br>and what became the biggest<br>investigation in the history of scottish<br>policing and they got nowhere the man<br>had simply vanished<br>from the face of the earth though he did<br>live on as a kind of legend a bogeyman<br>and i remember as a boy how the<br>identicates photo and the artist's<br>impression<br>of bible john would record from time to<br>time<br>in the tabloid newspapers like the daily<br>record it was<br>our equivalent of the ubiquitous<br>silky blonde mug shot of meyer henley<br>that again would always be appearing in<br>the news of the world or some of the<br>other english tabloids<br>our version of that was bible john<br>so what made the case so resonant well<br>partly it was the fact<br>that bible john was never caught<br>um but it was also a thing that the case<br>seemed to<br>say something about glasgow at that<br>particular time this was a time<br>of great social upheaval in glasgow it<br>was a time<br>when the old tenement slums<br>in the central city were being knocked<br>down and redeveloped<br>and people were being decanted to<br>massive peripheral housing schemes so<br>there are four housing schemes on the<br>corners four corners of<br>of glasgow and each of them<br>have upwards of 60 000<br>residents and so this was it was a major<br>sort of<br>um social transition and in some sense<br>it was a positive<br>development that people were you know<br>leaving the the slum conditions behind<br>um but of course the great thing about<br>the slums was that in those tight-knit<br>communities<br>everyone knew everyone else and you had<br>a sort of social network<br>with your neighbors when you moved to<br>those large anonymous<br>peripheral housing schemes suddenly you<br>had<br>an indoor toilet and a washing machine<br>but you didn't know who your next door<br>neighbor was um and this<br>created the conditions of paranoia in<br>which um<br>people began to believe that you know<br>anyone could be bible<br>john the neighbor might be bible john<br>and you know the man<br>standing beside you at the horseshoe bar<br>drinking his whiskey might be bible john<br>and there was a sort of pitch of<br>hysteria in 1969<br>in glasgow that people were making<br>citizens arrests<br>on individuals who in any way resembled<br>the identicate photograph so guys who<br>were<br>you know between let's say the age of 30<br>and 45<br>who had short red hair and overlapping<br>teeth you know found themselves suddenly<br>being<br>whispered about and and so on and it<br>reached the stage that the chief<br>constable of glasgow had to issue<br>letters to these individuals saying you<br>know the bearer<br>is certified as not being bible john<br>and so the case was um<br>it was a case that i i like to compare<br>it in some ways to<br>the john f kennedy assassination it it's<br>kind of the west of scotland<br>equivalent of the jfk assassination<br>um it's a case that you know people<br>return to<br>that a number of writers have written<br>about so<br>the journalist andrew o'hagan who writes<br>for<br>everyone's review of books wrote a<br>terrific memoir called the missing<br>which is a section devoted to bible john<br>uh similarly ian rankin in his breakout<br>novel black and blue in 1997<br>um features one of the strands in that<br>novel<br>uh relates to to the bible john killings<br>um so it was something that i suppose i<br>knew<br>from an early age that um it was<br>something that i wanted to write about<br>and certainly when i began to write<br>crime novels um it was a case that i was<br>inevitably<br>going to turn to um it did pose certain<br>problems though i mean i was conscious<br>for one thing that the children<br>of bible john's victims were still alive<br>and i felt a bit uneasy about using<br>their suffering<br>for what was essentially an<br>entertainment<br>um so as a way around that what<br>initially decided to do<br>was i mean as i mentioned the um<br>the original bible john mortals there<br>were three historical monsters<br>so what i would do was invent a<br>fictional fourth<br>bible john kelly so that i could explore<br>that killing and sort of use the<br>historical resonance of the bible john<br>murders but<br>not and tread on the on the toes of<br>ethically speaking<br>of the um the relatives of the of bible<br>john's<br>victims and so i did i wrote about 20<br>000 words of the book<br>uh using the you know the bible john<br>name using the names of the<br>real names of the victims and then i had<br>a kind of light bulb moment where i<br>thought<br>instead of just inventing a fictional<br>fourth<br>murder i could just change the name<br>altogether<br>and you sort of have free reign to just<br>treat the material how i how i wanted<br>and avoid some of the ethical i suppose<br>craziness that i felt<br>um surrounding it so that's what i did<br>and it will be very clear i mean anyone<br>who knows the bible join<br>story will instantly recognize that the<br>quaker is based on<br>bible john but at the same time it it<br>gave me a sense of ownership over the<br>narrative um when i started with those<br>first 20 000 words<br>i very often found that i was putting<br>things into the book just because they<br>happened<br>which is not sort of speaking from a<br>sort of<br>writerly perspective it's not a good<br>enough reason to put something into<br>a narrative i used to be there for a<br>sort of<br>aesthetic or dramatic purpose so so just<br>simply changing the name uh gave me a<br>sense that<br>instead of the material being in control<br>of me i was now<br>in control of the material<br>and i suppose the final sort of ethical<br>dilemma that confronted me in the book<br>was<br>um in my previous two novels the victims<br>had all been male<br>and i faced in the quaker the very<br>familiar crime fiction scenario<br>of the victims are all female<br>you know you've got the the violated<br>corpse of the female victim and then<br>you've got the male detectives who have<br>all the agency and go about solving the<br>crime and again that was<br>i was slightly morally ambivalent about<br>that so the way i<br>i chose to try and get around that was<br>to<br>basically do what alice siebel does in<br>the lovely bones<br>um or indeed um rosetta allen the great<br>new zealand<br>novelist and purgatory and have some<br>sections in the book<br>written by the quakers victims so<br>essentially written by the dead women<br>from beyond the grave so that's<br>probably a thing enough of of me banging<br>on about the novel as i say i would be<br>delighted to<br>hear what you thought of the book and<br>whether you liked it or<br>or not don't hold back and also just<br>what what questions you want to ask me<br>thanks liam thank you for that we'll<br>just wait for some questions to come<br>flowing into the q a so<br>to our attendees please feel free to pop<br>your questions into the q a function<br>and i'll pop up on our screen here and<br>you have burning in the back of your<br>mind with regards to the quaker<br>but um i'll start i'll start off liam if<br>you don't mind<br>how much easier do you think it would<br>have been if you had<br>totally um written about something that<br>had no place in history<br>prior if you know if you had totally<br>fabricated it all out of your mind and<br>didn't have the background do you think<br>it would have been easier or would it<br>pose you some<br>i think that would have been more<br>difficult daniella<br>um one of the things that attracted me<br>to<br>um the the bible john<br>story um was precisely that<br>you know being able to use an<br>existing crime you know having the<br>material already in existence that you<br>certainly have to shape<br>into into some kind of narrative<br>i think i mean one of one of the things<br>i've come to recognize about my own<br>practice as a crime writer is that<br>i think i write better when i've got a<br>clear sense of the structure<br>of what i'm writing and of course if<br>you're writing about<br>um an existing sort of series of of<br>murders in real life you've kind of got<br>your structure laid out i remember<br>discussing this with val mcdermott when<br>she was here last year as visiting<br>professor of crime fiction<br>and scottish studies at our centre um<br>and asking her about her own process<br>of structuring her novels and saying<br>and and she said that the tony hill and<br>carol jordan<br>novels which are based on always based<br>around a serial killer<br>almost wrote themselves because he<br>simply structured them according to<br>the various murders that took place in<br>in the course of the novel<br>it gives you a ready-made structure and<br>so when people ask<br>um you know what is this obsession with<br>serial killers<br>in crime fiction you know there's uh<br>far more serial killers in crime fiction<br>than there are committing crimes in real<br>life<br>well that's kind of your answer<br>thank you liam so we have some questions<br>coming through now the first question is<br>someone um charlotte has asked how did<br>you find writing from<br>a female and gay male perspective<br>yeah i mean i i think well i found it<br>great fun<br>to be honest um writing from a<br>perspective that wasn't<br>wasn't my own and i think in a way as a<br>writer<br>you're always looking for a way to bring<br>the material<br>to life and i think it was andre<br>who said that what you want to do as a<br>novelist is write about someone<br>who shares some of your background but<br>there's a sort of a bleak angle to it<br>there's some there's some element that<br>you don't<br>share um and so certainly with duncan<br>mccormick the fact that<br>that he was gay and and i'm not um<br>posed certain challenges but it was also<br>it was also more fun and<br>it it brings the material to life i<br>think when you've got to sort of<br>um use your imagination to a greater<br>extent<br>to try to inhabit a character um<br>writing from a female perspective is<br>something i've done<br>in some of the earlier books and i've<br>and i do it in short bursts in this<br>novel<br>and i absolutely these were these were<br>the chapters that i enjoyed writing<br>the most it was something about the<br>liberation of writing from a female<br>perspective that<br>i i just found hugely energizing it's<br>also quite scary of course<br>and um of course it's for it's for<br>female readers to judge whether uh i've<br>i've been a good job<br>or whether my female female characters<br>or even children see a female voice<br>uh appears authentic and i certainly i<br>haven't quite had the<br>courage yet to contemplate writing an<br>entire level<br>from a female perspective um but yeah<br>sometimes it's just a break<br>from writing about you know dreary west<br>of scotland<br>detective male detectives you know<br>i'm making a dreary west of scotland<br>mail myself so it's quite nice to kind<br>of break out of that box from time to<br>time<br>thanks liam i'm just going to add a bit<br>of an addition to this question that<br>we've had from charlotte<br>did you have a particular person who<br>helped you think about that female way<br>of way of thinking or<br>or did you and did you have somebody who<br>looked over<br>what you had written and said you know<br>that's not not how a female perspective<br>would see that<br>um well i suppose i was going i was<br>about to say no but i suppose my wife<br>reads everything that i write um<br>before i send it off and she very often<br>manages to pick up<br>errors of of consistency and<br>i am because i write so slowly um<br>i've often got a situation where in some<br>of my earlier books<br>where the character had young children<br>that you know in one scene they would be<br>sort of two and four and the next scene<br>they'd be like seven and nine or<br>whatever so she would<br>she would pick all that stuff up so<br>suppose she read over the<br>the chapters from a female perspective<br>um and for the for the sort of<br>gay i mean subsequently i've i had like<br>i had a great session<br>with the um eden gay<br>book club a group of gay men in<br>edinburgh who read<br>the book and i wish they'd done that in<br>advance of of writing the boot because<br>they had some<br>some fantastic insights into what it was<br>to be<br>gay in that particular period and they<br>said for instance you know there's a gay<br>character in the book who's picked up<br>and he's got a condom in his pocket i<br>said why is he got a condom in his<br>pocket<br>this is pre-aids you don't need a condom<br>so it was those little details that<br>um you know would just have added that<br>level of authenticity if i had<br>perhaps um spoken to more people in<br>advance of<br>writing the book fantastic thanks liam<br>um we've got another question here from<br>pat and she asked or here sorry<br>did you have a particular resolution<br>that you wanted<br>to achieve by writing the quaker for<br>yourself<br>or for the reader well i suppose one of<br>the attractions part<br>was to actually conclude<br>the the story um you know one of the<br>frustrations very often<br>of real life in relation to violent<br>crime<br>is that there is no closure that uh you<br>know we don't know who bible john<br>was there have been some suggestions as<br>to who he might be but we haven't been<br>able to definitively<br>identify the killer of these three women<br>so of course that's one of the<br>consolations of crime fiction that in<br>crime fiction<br>unlike in real life you can bring<br>that closure in that order so suppose<br>that was one of the attractions of<br>writing the novel was to<br>um write that essentially that bible<br>drawing story<br>but actually to bring the satisfaction<br>of like a narrative closure<br>to that material<br>thank you um the next question um comes<br>from melissa and she<br>asks you write in quite a glaswegian<br>vernacular<br>do you think some readers struggle with<br>this<br>yes i think that would be that would be<br>fair to say um i suppose it was a<br>a tension between the demand of<br>authenticity<br>and you know the uh the requirements of<br>simply being understood by<br>readers outside glasgow um i also have<br>quite a bit of scottish gaelic<br>uh in the book because duncan mccormick<br>is a galac<br>speaker and there are scenes where he's<br>interacting with other garlic speakers<br>and i don't provide a translation for<br>that<br>um so suppose you have to regard some of<br>the glaswegian idiom<br>in the same way um it's not there<br>deliberately to make passages obscure<br>um it's there really to give you a sense<br>of the authentic flavor<br>of the place and i suppose because so<br>much of glass region<br>culture and identity resides in how<br>people<br>use um you know english<br>scots vernacular in that city<br>so it would be um it would be very<br>difficult to write a book that felt<br>authentic to me<br>without at least deploying some of that<br>material<br>well where do you find that um coming<br>out and start relief<br>is when the books get translated so my<br>friends translated who bizarrely i<br>actually met<br>in dunedin and it's a chap called david<br>falconberg<br>who was actually over with the modern<br>languages<br>uh department on some sort of fellowship<br>so i managed to meet him<br>my friend's translator in indonesian but<br>he actually has fruit notes<br>in the french edition of the book<br>explaining certain terms<br>explaining some of the political<br>background some of the northern irish<br>uh paramilitary references in the book<br>and it did occur to me that<br>you know the actual the original version<br>might have benefited from<br>i'm sure some of your readers would have<br>liked them but others probably like<br>sorting it out for themselves<br>um some uh charlotte's asked another<br>question and she wants to know did you<br>find<br>using the real life mood has restricted<br>you at all<br>or that you had to stay quite true to<br>i think i did try to stay quite closely<br>stick quite closely to the the facts of<br>those cases<br>as we we have them um i suppose where i<br>departed from them or amplified those<br>details<br>was precisely in those chapters from the<br>perspective of of the women<br>and in a way that that's another reason<br>why i had to<br>fictionalize and change the names<br>because i of course don't know<br>what the interior life of the three<br>women who actually<br>died at the hands of bible john might<br>have been like<br>um but it was important to me to<br>try to give a sense of the interior life<br>of the victims because very often in<br>crime fiction<br>um you know the the corpse is simply a<br>plot point<br>you know you've got your dead women<br>great now we can go and investigate<br>the murder and that's of course<br>problematic<br>in all sorts of ways so in some in some<br>respects the chapters from the<br>perspective of<br>dead women are slightly<br>gratuitous in the sense that they don't<br>really advance the plot<br>um in any sense it's<br>and that again i think was partly why i<br>enjoyed writing them there was something<br>there was a sense of freedom that<br>you know when you're writing a thriller<br>or a police procedural<br>it's quite you've got to keep quite a<br>tight ship you know everything has to<br>have a significance you have to layer in<br>your clues<br>and it's quite hard work just in terms<br>of<br>structuring a crime level so i think um<br>those chapters from the perspective of<br>the murdered women<br>were a little bit freer for for that<br>reason that i could just simply<br>great thank you questions are still<br>coming in which is great to see so<br>please just feel free to add them to the<br>q<br>a we have one from a participant in<br>singapore so welcome i'm sure it's much<br>warmer in singapore than it is in<br>dunedin at the moment<br>so quick from singapore has asked that<br>the background of your previous books<br>all happen in glasgow<br>would you will you be writing a new book<br>that focuses<br>on new zealand rather than scotland<br>yes well that's quite a timely question<br>in fact just last week<br>i began a novel set in dunedin<br>which is something that i have resisted<br>um partly through a sense that i you<br>know hadn't lived in new zealand long<br>have a sense of how to write about the<br>place so i guess i've been in dunedin<br>for nearly 12<br>years now so i suppose suddenly i<br>i now feel okay i've been here for 12<br>years i've got some sort of grasp<br>of how to write about this city so i<br>have i have<br>just started i've written a couple of<br>thousand words<br>of a novel based in dunedin<br>um which is great fun and it's also um<br>it's also very convenient because of<br>course one of the problems of writing<br>about<br>glasgow from 12 000 miles away is that<br>you spend quite a lot of time on google<br>maps<br>you know looking at the locations that<br>you're writing about<br>and google maps can only take you so far<br>you really want the<br>textures and the smells and the kind of<br>essence of<br>of physically being in a place so of<br>course that's<br>it's i'm finding that great fun uh sort<br>of scouting locations if you like<br>for this to reading book and being able<br>to simply stroll<br>down to whichever location it might<br>happen<br>to be so that i mean that will be a bit<br>of a departure for me and and<br>you know we'll see whether it's<br>successful or or not one of the things<br>that that gives me hope is the<br>the great strength of new zealand crime<br>rating at the moment not least in this<br>city with people like<br>vanda simon patty richards and finn bell<br>and so on there's a real nucleus of<br>crime writers in this<br>city and i think if you look at the<br>amazing success that vanda simon has<br>recently enjoyed in the uk<br>where orenda publishing have reissued<br>uh all of vanda's books and also they've<br>asked her to revise<br>the books not to tone down the new<br>zealand content but in fact<br>to amplify that to bring in more<br>references to<br>i don't know pineapple lumps or tin<br>times or whatever it may be<br>again to give that sense of the<br>authentic sort of kiwi location<br>so i mean i think it's a an auspicious<br>time<br>for new zealand crime fiction so<br>hopefully this i can ride a wee bit of<br>that wave<br>with the book set in new zealand a great<br>question<br>thanks for that i'm sure there's many of<br>our attendees who are very happy to know<br>that there's something being um based in<br>the area that they studied or maybe live<br>in so thank you for that liam<br>uh the next question we've got is from<br>craig it's a bit more of a<br>logistical and technical one and he'd<br>like you to<br>describe what your writing day looks<br>like<br>right um well i suppose the first thing<br>craig is that i try to write in the<br>mornings<br>so of course i have a sort of<br>bifurcated existence as on the one hand<br>an academic<br>professor of scottish studies focusing<br>on literature<br>and on the other hand a creative writer<br>and they are quite different i do find<br>that they use quite different<br>you know parts of your of your mind if<br>you like and i even physically in my<br>office<br>in the standard verizon scottish studies<br>i have two desks<br>i have a desk where i do my academic<br>stuff and then i kind of turn around<br>and in a slightly different physical<br>location doing my creative<br>writing um but i try to do i think the<br>creative i find that the creative<br>writing<br>takes more out of me in terms of mental<br>energy<br>um so i try to do that in the in the<br>mornings<br>i suppose my typical day would be um<br>i'm trying to start quite early i would<br>have a notional<br>world counts um i would try as an<br>absolute minimum to do my<br>my graham green 500 words<br>um but i would i would hope i mean<br>usually i i sort of hit around<br>700 750 which actually if you i mean if<br>you're able to do that regularly<br>you know you can build up an 80 000 word<br>novel<br>relatively quickly i've never actually<br>done that but<br>you can do that and then i suppose i<br>would um<br>do my sort of academic work in the<br>afternoons<br>i would if you're interested in the<br>actual kind of process i would try and<br>write<br>in longhand in notebooks first<br>and then transcribe that and edit as i<br>go<br>onto the computer and i find um<br>i find the process of writing long and<br>long<br>hand um it's it slows you down<br>sufficiently uh you know i feel like i<br>write too far if i'm writing the<br>computer today<br>you know i can uh almost write faster<br>than i need to i want to sort of<br>slow down and try and um arrange my<br>sentences that the way i would like and<br>i find that easier to do writing<br>along hand writing one hand with a<br>kaweco sport fountain pen on<br>a 90 msg japanese life<br>notebooks craig if you want the actual<br>thank you for that detail i think<br>there's something interesting about the<br>fact that that creative<br>um notion comes easily from the brain to<br>that that physical movement of writing<br>and not the tapping that we all<br>associate with work so i think that's a<br>really interesting point<br>um you know i agree that it certainly<br>would seem to make sense to me to write<br>in longhand<br>uh karen wants to know if you've got any<br>hope or is there any<br>notion that um this novel will be made<br>into a tv<br>series or film she said that she found<br>the novel wonderfully visual and spatial<br>and very vivid in her mind's eye as she<br>read it so i think<br>she would be quite hopeful that she<br>might be able to watch it on the big<br>screen any plans for that<br>yes again good question karen and<br>i suppose um i have always you know<br>tried to<br>to write with not necessarily with that<br>in mind but you know<br>i am quite a visual uh writer<br>so in fact uh the book was optioned<br>for tv so we had a choice in fact there<br>were two<br>companies in for it one was<br>world productions who make line of duty<br>the great<br>corps show in the uk and the other was<br>left bank who do the crown<br>so it was a fantastic choice and and<br>very exciting<br>of course i knew at the time that<br>whichever one i picked<br>i would subsequently think ah i should<br>have gone with the other one<br>um because these things never get never<br>get made<br>uh so i was quite excited we went with<br>uh<br>with world productions to do line of<br>duty because they had<br>they had um drawn up a very convincing<br>treatment of how they would how they<br>would deal with the<br>material um and of course<br>you know i think the the option runs for<br>18 months<br>and i think they tried a couple of<br>places to<br>to get it made couldn't couldn't come up<br>with the funding<br>so it lapsed so i think that's that's<br>kind of par for the course<br>my meet colin gavigan the professor of<br>law diversion technologies at otago it's<br>very friendly<br>with uh the writer whose name escapes me<br>who wrote altered carbon<br>which became an hbo i think uh<br>series and that apparently he had he was<br>the what was being optioned every 18<br>months for about 20 years<br>uh before it was made finally made into<br>a series<br>so i think um i don't really hold out<br>much hope<br>uh but i think if it does you know very<br>often it takes a long<br>a long long time so it's one of these<br>things i guess you just sort of keep the<br>head down and keep writing the books<br>and if that happens it would be a<br>fantastic bonus but it's not really<br>worth expending much mental energy<br>kind of hoping that it will because the<br>odds are very heavily stacked<br>against it canon thank you i think<br>um for the lovers of the book um having<br>it<br>recreated on the screen is a double rh<br>sword because what you've got in your<br>mind's eye then gets<br>transformed into someone else's view of<br>what it should be and<br>no it doesn't always work for a reader<br>does it yeah but of course the i mean i<br>can't remember which writer it was who<br>who was asked um you know what do you<br>think about what they've done<br>to your book and his response was well<br>they haven't done anything to the book<br>where's the book still sitting on the<br>shelf uh and i'm very much of that<br>viewpoint that you know whatever happens<br>with the tv version the book still<br>retains its integrity<br>thanks asks for another question and<br>she tells us that she finds serial<br>killers fascinating like watching a<br>venomous snake observe but not too<br>closely<br>do you have a generic theory of what<br>creates a person<br>who can then become a recurrent killer<br>like this<br>and would you need a theory to be able<br>to write about them<br>well again that's an interesting<br>question part<br>i actually wrote the quaker without<br>much i mean i was focused very<br>particularly on the specific<br>case of the bible john murders<br>so i hadn't really read much in the way<br>of you know wider<br>reading around around serial killers and<br>funnily enough i actually have done<br>quite a lot of that reading<br>in in the time since finishing the<br>quaker so i've<br>been reading my way through uh john<br>douglas you know the the<br>the fbi profiler who jack crawford's in<br>the science of lambs is based on<br>i read his book mind hunter recently<br>which is of course<br>the uh the netflix series is based on<br>and i have found myself um you know<br>reading<br>anne rules great book about ted bundy<br>and and<br>you're right there is something much as<br>you would like to maintain<br>a kind of dignified distance from<br>those individuals there is something<br>absolutely absorbing and<br>i think it is the contrast between<br>how you expect someone who's capable of<br>the kind of horrific<br>acts that these serial killers<br>um perpetrate you kind of instinctively<br>imagine that there's<br>you know some sort of rabid raging<br>beast whereas of course many of them<br>like ted bundy are<br>utterly charming in real life um<br>you know there seems to be a complete<br>disconnect in other words between<br>the the way these individuals project<br>themselves<br>socially and the actual reality<br>of their nature and i think that's<br>always fascinating in fiction and then<br>crime fiction that<br>in a sense the reveal in crime fiction<br>um is very important when you actually<br>um expose<br>okay you know the the kind of puero<br>explains chapter at the end of agatha<br>christie<br>novels where the least likely candidate<br>is suddenly identified<br>as the killer and that's irresistible in<br>crime fiction i think that's another<br>reason why serial killers<br>are are so fascinating so i mean in<br>terms of what what makes<br>a serial killer yeah i guess um<br>you know if you read john douglas's mind<br>hunter you have a pretty<br>pretty um extensive checklist uh<br>part of those characteristics<br>great i i think adrian's uh question<br>follows on from that so she asks whether<br>you shape your characters<br>based off snippets from people you know<br>from perhaps the way they might say<br>something or how they walk or a<br>particular item a person was wearing<br>that you may remember<br>and are you always looking for aspects<br>to include in future characters<br>or do you just try and keep them<br>independent from your own life<br>and so there's quite a few questions in<br>here and how real do you make them in<br>your mind<br>who was that question from danila sorry<br>adrian<br>adrian that's a great question adrian um<br>i suppose characters are always an<br>amalgam<br>of traits from you know people that you<br>know<br>and also from characters that you've<br>read in<br>in books so i i mean one of my all-time<br>favorite<br>novels is graham green's the quiet<br>american and that novel features uh<br>a relationship between a kind of jaded<br>older<br>journalist and a kind of dangerously<br>idealistic<br>younger man and for some reason that<br>that relationship features in<br>everything i write i sometimes feel that<br>i'm just sort of rewriting<br>graham green's the quiet american with<br>everything that i write<br>so you know don't underestimate the<br>importance of literary characters<br>in in how you you create a character<br>inevitably of course you<br>um you take you know physical traits<br>or little ticks of of character<br>from people that you that you know and<br>and even names<br>um so that can be quite uh quite<br>interesting when you realize that<br>um you know you're meeting someone an<br>old friend and they<br>say well why why is my why have you used<br>my name for this horrendous you know<br>i suppose the other thing i try to do<br>with characters is<br>sort of not get too uh<br>bound up with with trying to know<br>everything about them<br>you know some writers advocate sort of<br>keeping folders about<br>characters and knowing you know<br>what happened to them in you know<br>primary school and what their<br>favorite color is or or whatever it<br>might be<br>i don't think that's particularly<br>important i tend to agree with<br>with david mamet the american dramatist<br>who says that character is action<br>you know you find out who your character<br>is by what they do<br>so your task as a novelist is to create<br>interesting dilemmas<br>for a character that kind of force them<br>to choose<br>a particular path or another and in that<br>choice that sort of reveals<br>their character so rather than trying to<br>compile<br>a sense of personality traits and then<br>illustrate those with the action<br>very often if you create a character<br>even quite a sketchy character<br>and give them a compelling dilemma you<br>then start to find out<br>along with the reader almost who this<br>character is<br>but you're right that question of<br>finding this sort of telling detail<br>is absolutely crucial i'm reading at the<br>moment<br>and michael conley who due to my mind is<br>the the finest<br>crime writer alive i'm reading a book of<br>his<br>uh crime journalism he was a crime<br>reporter before he became<br>a novelist and one of the things he says<br>is<br>um just watching detectives at work and<br>finding the telling detail<br>like he was watching one particular<br>homicide detective<br>who whenever he was confronted with a<br>particularly gruesome<br>murder scene would remove his spectacles<br>and sort of put the leg of the<br>spectacles in his mouth and he noticed<br>that he had chewed a deep groove<br>in the leg of of his spectacles and<br>that's the novelistic detail<br>you don't need to say that this is a<br>character who feels a lot of stress and<br>pressure<br>in the job he's doing there's a groove<br>in his spectacles<br>made by his teeth that does the job for<br>you so it's those little details that<br>great question thanks adrian and uh liam<br>thanks for the answer<br>um judith would like to know how did you<br>get the internal knowledge of how the<br>police work<br>yes again very good question judith so<br>i think that is really important in<br>crime fiction one of the things that you<br>learn as a crime writer<br>is that you know crime readers are very<br>exacting<br>um and they really do demand<br>authenticity<br>you know wherever possible and they will<br>right to tell you<br>if you get you know the specs of a gun<br>or<br>or something that you regard as as quite<br>trivial<br>wrong they will write and tell you so i<br>think it is important to get that stuff<br>correct<br>as far as you can and unfortunately my<br>cousin<br>uh is a retired firearms instructor for<br>strathclyde police<br>so my cousin davey joined what was then<br>the city of glasgow police<br>in 1975 when he was 17 and in scotland<br>you do 30 years as a cop and you're<br>finished that's you<br>you're out so he retired at the age of<br>47<br>on a full police pension um with not<br>really much to do with his time<br>which was a great boon to me because i<br>would then uh<br>and also the um the time difference<br>worked brilliantly for this i would<br>before i went to bed in new zealand<br>i would say davey how does this work<br>send them a question<br>and they would wake up in the morning<br>and davey would have written 3 000 words<br>complete with photos and hyperlinks and<br>you know i think he should almost have<br>been co-credited with with the book<br>um and he was also uh you know<br>one of the books i i changed the<br>scenario for such a dramatic effect<br>and i was when it came to write the<br>acknowledgements<br>i said you know i'm going to include you<br>in acknowledgements and he said well<br>actually<br>if you could leave me out of the<br>acknowledgements that that would be<br>great<br>i said you know why and he said well um<br>in this particular scenario that would<br>never happen but i don't want<br>my mates in the in the force thinking<br>that i had okayed you know<br>so sometimes that could be a bit of a<br>double-edged sword for the quaker which<br>of course is is set in 1969 um<br>davey put me in touch with two uh<br>homicide detectives<br>in glasgow who hadn't actually worked<br>the bible drawn<br>inquiry but they had been in the cid<br>around that time so they knew the<br>procedures<br>and let's say that they these two<br>gentlemen rude the day<br>that they uh gave me their email<br>addresses because i i sort of<br>mercilessly plagued them<br>for details but i think that you know<br>you can you can glean quite a lot of<br>information<br>from research and from books but there's<br>nothing to beat<br>being able to just think right i've got<br>a particular scenario<br>i can email this guy and get get it from<br>the horse's mouth<br>so if you can at all if it's at all<br>possible to get a real live contact who<br>doesn't mind being badgered<br>by any questions about<br>procedure then you know that's great<br>thanks it's great to hear that level of<br>authenticity and reality and and what<br>you've been writing i'm sure um the<br>readers will be very pleased to read<br>those attendees who are on we've got a<br>few more minutes so please feel free to<br>um put your questions in we've got some<br>more questions here<br>and um pat asks was writing a success<br>for you right from the beginning<br>or are there earlier falses<br>well and i i mean i haven't written<br>novels that weren't published<br>um i may have written novels that<br>shouldn't have been published<br>but uh no i don't have you know six<br>uh six novels in a drawer uh as i was<br>trying to sort of<br>aspire to to publication i think partly<br>the the reason for that is i was quite<br>old when i i mean i was<br>40 when my first novel was was published<br>and i also write<br>i also revise very thoroughly as i go<br>so i'm not i'm not the kind of writer<br>who can sort of battle through and get a<br>rough draft and then bring it into shape<br>i try to polish things up as i go which<br>is quite a slow process but i think<br>you're probably emerged with<br>um a more obviously publishable<br>work at the end of that sort of process<br>and so i didn't have a kind of long<br>apprenticeship of<br>you know struggling to be a writer in<br>fact it it kind of happened completely<br>by<br>accident i had um<br>written a chapter in an academic book<br>about contemporary british<br>fiction that was being launched the book<br>was being launched in london<br>and i happened to be in london visiting<br>my sister who at the time was living<br>in hampstead so i walked up to this<br>party<br>and i met a guy called lee blackstone<br>from faber and faber<br>who knew my literary journalism had<br>written quite a lot of reviews for the<br>times literary supplement in the london<br>review of books and so on and i was<br>chatting to him at this party<br>and he said do you write fiction have<br>you got anything you could show me<br>so in that moment i decided that the<br>uh the best course of action would be to<br>lie through my teeth<br>and say yes i do so then went back home<br>back up to to aberdeen and wrote six<br>thousand words in a kind of frantic<br>flurry and sent them to him and it kind<br>of snowballed<br>from there so if i'd never bumped into<br>uh<br>lee blackstone at the only london<br>literary party i have ever attended<br>um you know i probably wouldn't have<br>started writing novels so it was quite<br>fortuitous<br>it's wonderful to hear that um part of<br>your successes is due down<br>due to serendipity it's it's a nice<br>twist to the story<br>um liam is crime fiction your favorite<br>genre to<br>to read or do you have another genre<br>that you prefer to read yourself other<br>than what you<br>yes um i suppose i i do read a lot of<br>crime fiction as as you would imagine<br>both because i enjoy it and to keep up<br>with what's happening in the in the<br>genre<br>and basically to define things that you<br>can use in your in your<br>in your own books um i also read an<br>awful lot of poetry<br>uh poetry is something that i<br>that's possibly what i enjoy reading<br>most<br>and i also find that it it works very<br>well in conjunction with crime fiction<br>which might seem like a curious thing to<br>say but i do find that i i<br>read i tend to read poetry before i<br>actually write<br>sit down to write my crime fiction so i<br>kind of prime<br>my writing brain if you like by maybe<br>reading some<br>i don't know paul muldoon or or<br>srinachini<br>or leonsha flynn and then sort of sit<br>down to write<br>to write my crime fiction i also read a<br>lot of<br>literary fiction um which which most<br>crime writers do and one of the<br>interesting things<br>i think is that um that sense of a big<br>divide between<br>genre fiction your crime fiction and<br>literary fiction<br>is not something that most crime writers<br>recognize most of the crime writers i<br>know<br>you know people like val mcdermott or<br>adrian mckenty or steve kavanagh<br>read a lot of crime fiction they read a<br>lot of literary fiction you know val<br>mcdermott was a judge for the bucket<br>prize<br>lead child was a judge for the booker<br>prize<br>but very often in the other direction<br>you know writers who only write literary<br>fiction<br>will feel entitled to dismiss the entire<br>genre of crime fiction is kind of<br>beneath their notice which<br>i think both infuriates and kind of<br>thanks for the lamb i have i have a<br>question that i want to bring back to<br>the beginning and you talked about the<br>ethical issues about writing<br>a topic that had happened in how you<br>change<br>things to move away from that have you<br>had any um feedback from any of the<br>families who were actually involved in<br>in the original um murders no this was a<br>question that steve bronius in fact<br>asked me at<br>the reading writers festival a couple of<br>years ago<br>and i suppose you might argue that it<br>was incumbent on me to<br>to contact the families in advance i<br>suppose i took<br>the the view that and<br>i would try to to treat the material as<br>ethically as<br>i could but i would also recognize that<br>in some respects the bible drawn<br>killings have become<br>part of the social history of the the<br>place in which i grew up<br>you know the west of scotland is um you<br>know<br>there's kind of no escape in some<br>respects from from the bible john<br>murders so so in that sense that kind of<br>passed into a certain communal<br>ownership that writing about the bible<br>john<br>murders um you know<br>as to some extent writing about how the<br>west scotland came to be the kind of<br>community that i experienced when i when<br>i grew up<br>um so but i would be i mean i'd be<br>um you know i think it's perfectly<br>legitimate for people to question the<br>the morality of of of that<br>um i think just with crime fiction<br>that's just always a line that you have<br>to trade<br>and you have to try and trade it to the<br>best of your abilities but you also have<br>to be<br>open to people who perhaps think that<br>you didn't get everything right and that<br>you perhaps<br>you know might have been more sensitive<br>in your treatment of a particular<br>area and so i think you know i'm i tried<br>to be quite open to<br>criticism on on that's good the other<br>thing of course with this book<br>uh is the title which again was not my<br>title it was the title that was chosen<br>by<br>my editor uh but that has caused me<br>i wouldn't say grief but um you know the<br>society of friends<br>after somebody said quite legitimately<br>you know miffed that i've chosen to<br>besmirch their um denomination<br>with the title of the book but again in<br>my defense i would argue that the<br>the quaker is presented very much in the<br>novel as a<br>a tabloid nickname coined by a<br>journalist not something that<br>uh you know should carry any more weight<br>than that but<br>that has led to some interesting<br>conversations<br>well thanks liam i see that we've come<br>to the end of time really i want to be<br>respectful of everyone's<br>evenings and in parts of the day that<br>you may be in wherever you are in the<br>world<br>but i'd like to extend a huge thank you<br>to you liam it's been a fascinating<br>fascinating insight into not only your<br>process and writing and your research<br>but also your thought processes that you<br>go through to<br>develop and create the stories that<br>so many people around the world have<br>loved and it's nice for us to have a wee<br>insight to hear that yes<br>maybe there's a tv series coming and yes<br>maybe there's a story about dunedin<br>coming so thank you for sharing those<br>little bits of insight<br>sorry if i could just say it i thought<br>you know thanks so much for hosting this<br>and i'm deeply grateful to all the<br>participants who have<br>tuned in and listened to me banging on<br>uh for so long but the questions were<br>terrific and hopefully<br>i've thrown some light on the writing<br>process thanks very much<br>you're welcome and thank you to our<br>participants i can say that<br>um i've been watching and and without a<br>word of a lie all participants have<br>stayed on<br>right to the very end of tonight they're<br>still there and that is unheard of in a<br>webinar so well done liam<br>um to our participants if you have any<br>burning questions which you think<br>of once we leave please feel free to<br>email them<br>to us and and i'll pass them on to liam<br>and hopefully he will find some time to<br>answer those at a<br>later date but once again thank you<br>everybody so much for<br>um joining with us if you have any<br>feedback about<br>our book club feel free to pass it on uh<br>we would hope to continue that with<br>um with the book club again next year<br>it's been a good success<br>and given the fact that um meeting in<br>person is a little bit difficult at the<br>moment we<br>see this as a good way of keeping<br>engaged with some of our members of our<br>alumni<br>so thank you to everyone warm thanks to<br>liam and i wish you all a very good<br>evening
