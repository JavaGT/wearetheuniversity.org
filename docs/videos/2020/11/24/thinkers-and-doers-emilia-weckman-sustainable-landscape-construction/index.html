Construction interferes with natural processes: the water cycle, soil, areas of vegetation, etc., all crucial factors in terms of ecosystem services. The aim for sustainable landscape construction should be to cherish the vitality and continuity of these processes. In addition, social sustainability is emphasised in operating principles that concern human health and wellbeing as well as economic sustainability in the use of raw materials and energy-saving. This lecture explores the operating model associated with environmental construction and by following sustainable development goals. It explores that through different themes: 1) Water conditions, 2) Soil and vegetation, 3) Raw materials and products, 4) Energy-saving, air quality and environmental protection, and 5) Health and wellbeing. Different stages of project implementation will be addressed by logging the operating principles of order, design, construction and maintenance. The lecture also introduces the Sustainable Landscape Construction Model (KESY) presented in 2015 by the Finnish Association of Landscape Industries, which considers what the objectives are for sustainable development in the green sector and how they can be achieved. This operating model has been introduced in practical guidelines to the professional field of landscape industries in Finland since 2018.<br><br>Emilia Weckman is a Landscape Architect and a Lecturer in Landscape Architecture at Aalto University, Finland. She has practised as a landscape architect for more than 15 years, mostly as an entrepreneur and consultant through her own practice (LOCI Landscape Architects Ltd until 2013, and now WE3 Ltd). Her experience as a designer includes a range of different planning scales, from city-wide commissions to more intimate and detailed construction projects. She is an active part in developing the profession both in Finland and internationally; as past president of MARK, the Finnish Association for Landscape Architects (2015-2017) and member of the board for over 10 years; as an active member of VYL, the Finnish Landscape Industries Association, an umbrella organisation representing the Green Sector Associations; and, as the immediate past Vice President for Education in the European Region of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (2015-2019).<br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims to bring together practitioners, scholars, students, and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>all right<br>um no my head am i a tenecotto<br>tenekoto<br>warm greetings to everyone who is<br>joining us here in new zealand but<br>also from across the globe and it is my<br>pleasure to welcome you to the lecture<br>of emilia wagman<br>as part of the thinkers and doers<br>lecture series<br>for those who don't know me my name is<br>bruno marquez and i'm the program<br>director for<br>landscape architecture at terrengawak<br>victoria university of wellington<br>so this lecture series as probably most<br>of you know by now<br>aims at bringing together practitioners<br>scholars and students<br>and a wider community of landscape<br>architects and other<br>affiliated built environment disciplines<br>to share ideas and to hear the latest<br>innovations in the field<br>this lecture series is the initiative<br>between the new zealand institute of<br>landscape architects in victoria<br>university of wellington<br>our 14th speaker emily welcome is<br>a landscape architect and a lecturer at<br>alt university<br>finland she has practiced as a landscape<br>architect for more than 15 years<br>mostly as an entrepreneur and consultant<br>through her own practice her experience<br>as a designer<br>includes a range of different planning<br>scales from city-wide commissions<br>to more intimate and detailed<br>construction projects<br>she's also an active part uh party in<br>developing the profession<br>both in finland and international<br>internationally<br>and she has been the past president of<br>mark<br>the finnish association of landscape<br>architects uh<br>and she's also been part of the board<br>for over 10 years<br>she's also an active member of vwl the<br>finnish landscape industries association<br>an umbrella organization representing<br>the green sector<br>associations and she's also the<br>immediate past<br>vice president for education for the<br>european region after international<br>federation of landscape architects<br>so the title of this lecture is<br>sustainable landscape construction<br>an operating model for landscape<br>industries and this lecture focuses on<br>the goals for sustainable development<br>particularly ecological sustainability<br>and its importance to landscape<br>construction as a way to mitigate<br>the damages caused in natural processes<br>and ecosystem services<br>so this lecture explores the operating<br>model associated with<br>environmental construction and by<br>following sustainable development goals<br>it explores that through different<br>themes water conditions<br>soil and vegetation raw materials and<br>products<br>energy saving air quality and<br>environmental protection<br>as well as health and well-being<br>different stages of<br>project implementation will be addressed<br>by<br>logging the operating principles of<br>order design construction maintenance<br>the lecture also introduces the<br>sustainable landscape construction model<br>you need to correct that later on<br>presented in 2015 by the<br>finnish association of landscape<br>industries<br>which considers what the objectives are<br>for sustainable development<br>in the green sector and how they can be<br>achieved<br>so just very briefly some housekeeping<br>rules and don't forget that emilia will<br>be sharing her screen<br>so try to keep this window open so you<br>can see her slides<br>and i also kindly ask you to remain<br>muted throughout the talk<br>and at the end there will be plenty of<br>time for questions<br>you can either ask those verbally or<br>or just by writing them on a chat box<br>without further ado please join me in<br>giving<br>a warm welcome to emilia all the way<br>from helsinki<br>finland yes<br>thank you bruno hello everybody i think<br>i will just start by sharing my screen<br>okay i guess you can you can see i'm<br>just<br>all working okay no i cannot<br>okay it's going on yeah okay uh<br>hello everybody and um thank you for the<br>invitation to talk<br>um uh as bruno told you i'm a landscape<br>architect<br>and aldo university is my like main main<br>work but<br>i do have my own practice and i kind of<br>uh i think it's very important when you<br>you're teaching that you also have<br>very close connection to the to the like<br>own design work which i do here in<br>finland<br>um as i said um the topic of this<br>presentation<br>you can see here bruno gave a<br>short introduction i don't have to<br>repeat that so i will just<br>go further so start with the basics<br>um and kind of to explain i i guess well<br>most of you might be<br>landscape architects or students of of<br>the field<br>or otherwise familiar with the<br>with the topic in a certain point<br>i will just say that i have some texts<br>here also in finnish because a couple<br>weeks ago i gave this<br>a talk in estonia so<br>because that's they're familiar with the<br>finnish language so you can see there's<br>two two languages on some of the slides<br>but anyways we'll start with some basics<br>and to explain what the sustainable<br>landscape construction means<br>sustainable sites initiative<br>says this that the purpose of<br>sustainable landscape construction<br>is to design build and maintain the<br>environment<br>in such a way that we avoid reduce<br>compensate<br>or prevent the negative effects of<br>construction<br>then of course well i think this might<br>be very familiar to you<br>but what we mean when we talk about<br>landscape construction what we meant in<br>the project<br>is of course all the building processes<br>that take place<br>outdoors between the buildings and all<br>the kind of phases and different layers<br>and of course the sustainability uh<br>from the perspective of sustainable<br>development<br>um particularly<br>ecological sustainability is is<br>emphasizing landscape construction<br>that's because we<br>we intervene with the natural processes<br>the water cycle and the soil and the<br>areas of vegetation<br>so to say all the key factors in terms<br>of ecosystem services<br>so and the aim should be that we are<br>cherishing the vitality and the quantity<br>of these processes<br>so these are the kind of starting points<br>and of course<br>well this might be very kind of<br>well we all know this there's a global<br>and national<br>mega trends and problems that we kind of<br>need to<br>need to solve they are all linked in<br>many ways<br>and um kind of a local change can affect<br>the far<br>reaching consequences and we have<br>in vitro environmental issues and<br>problems that are<br>for me of course when you think how it<br>is visible in the field of landscape<br>architecture<br>these are the questions that our field<br>and many other related fields have been<br>working with for a long time<br>but then you can say maybe at the<br>like present times there are a lot of<br>like um<br>concepts that are more widely may be<br>known and recognized than<br>had these kind of concepts or or<br>understanding<br>um but nowadays they are more more up to<br>a bigger audience know about these<br>issues<br>well the building industry has a<br>substantial effect on the environment<br>this is a bit of a older number but from<br>2012<br>um already then globally<br>the built environment cost almost half<br>of the material extra extraction from<br>the new products and also<br>60 percent of all waste is result of<br>construction and demolition<br>and also the the situation that we have<br>that the urbanization<br>grows all the time what is built on the<br>land<br>it profoundly impacts ecological systems<br>we can also look at this as a positive<br>uh perspective so<br>the building industry has a significant<br>role in changing<br>this uh kind of uh developing the<br>sustainable working policies and<br>preventing<br>the harmful and negative effects so we<br>are we are effecting a lot<br>but then we can also have the positive<br>effect if we are changing our ways of<br>of doing things i will just um<br>take one uh example from<br>from europe and from finland um<br>uh understanding for of<br>of the concept of of waste is changing<br>uh in in here and the european union<br>directive there is a meaning that<br>the waste means any substance or object<br>that which the holder discards or<br>intends or is required<br>to discard and we have a waste here<br>hierarchy you have to<br>producing the waste of course you have<br>to then the second is to prepare for<br>reuse<br>then you have to think about the<br>recycling and then maybe<br>use it in another way and the last one<br>is<br>this disposal and<br>we've had this aims at the moment<br>already in the end of by the end of this<br>year<br>uh the aim is to reuse 70 of all waste<br>as a material<br>um here is some numbers from finland<br>from couple of years ago um it was a<br>long that we had the level of 25<br>but um in year 202017 it was<br>coming up already to 58 and and i'm not<br>sure<br>that if we are you know getting to the<br>level of 70<br>but for us the building industry<br>produces 50 million tons of waste and<br>most of it<br>is mineral substance so mainly mineral<br>soils<br>um so how to gain this objective of 70<br>reuse of materials um we have<br>in finland there we have these different<br>programs and also<br>some legislation that tries to support<br>the use of ways that<br>in earth works and ground structures i'm<br>not going to translate this<br>matter what it means but it's a it's a<br>regulation that reduces the need for<br>environmental permission on ground<br>construction<br>and permits the use of recycled material<br>in certain situation<br>and also there's a new regulation coming<br>up uh concerning<br>excavated soils and materials which is<br>well it's not<br>done already yet but it's it's coming<br>but then we we were kind of the project<br>that we<br>we started we we thought that we need to<br>address<br>this question in in the field of<br>landscape industries<br>and i'm talking about the field as a<br>whole<br>we felt that we are kind of missing uh<br>clear instructions and guidelines how to<br>achieve sustainable working methods in<br>our<br>own field of work and this operating<br>model has<br>considered what are the objectives for<br>sustainable development in landscape<br>sector<br>and how they can be achieved uh<br>and i mean here we have then developed<br>this to apply to the end<br>to entire operating process of the<br>landscape sector it means<br>like the ordering meaning the clients<br>municipalities and maybe building<br>companies<br>and then the designers um also<br>construction<br>constructing some landscapers and then<br>also maintaining<br>the green areas um and also uh<br>it should effect on the material and<br>just to talk a bit about the background<br>as i said there was a kind of a question<br>in the field that we<br>we needed to answer uh we have an<br>association<br>that was mentioned in the before the<br>finnish association of landscape<br>industries it's a it's a umbrella<br>organization that actually gathers<br>all the um all the actors of the field<br>so we have<br>landscape architects there there we have<br>the landscapers we have the<br>nurseries for example so in my<br>understanding it's quite<br>exceptional actually in europe european<br>level that we have so many<br>um associations collect i mean<br>under one umbrella and i think that was<br>what's up one thing that made this<br>project<br>special that we we were<br>we were it was possible to kind of cover<br>all the aspects<br>and and part to participate all the<br>parties<br>uh of a building process um<br>we started with the seminar it was<br>actually 2015<br>and it it was a seminar that kind of<br>gathered the topical<br>questions from the field at that time<br>that we we thought that we need to<br>solve somehow and then the question of<br>the sustainable<br>solutions in our field came up and also<br>the emphasis of the practical level<br>we found that there was a need for this<br>kind of operating principles<br>of of some sort we started as a working<br>group<br>and then it developed to a three-year<br>project<br>i was leading the work we got some<br>support from<br>some foundations we had a couple of<br>persons with me hannah and hannah maria<br>working with me professionals and then<br>said partner he was<br>the representative of the association of<br>landscape industries and<br>how we worked was mostly workshops uh we<br>had<br>uh several workshops uh i guess we kind<br>of gathered<br>uh around 300 professionals all together<br>to different workshops<br>during the time and we were<br>completing the project around 2018<br>actually opened the website for the<br>project<br>uh and after that we have continued by<br>uh introducing these kind of practical<br>guidelines<br>for working life so it it's kind of an<br>ongoing process it's not<br>actually ended in a way but but we<br>opened the website in 2018.<br>the operating model is actually based on<br>some international guidelines and<br>quality models<br>and one of the main material that we<br>used was<br>the assessment and certification system<br>called sustainable sites initiative<br>which is from the us<br>i guess it might be familiar for you but<br>we also collected<br>uh we have kind of used european green<br>city<br>and green flag and green label<br>guidelines<br>as well as some other relevant<br>literature and material<br>and one of the main goals was to kind of<br>collect all the information<br>all the criteria that is there already<br>and then we<br>we we wanted to adapt this criteria to<br>our<br>to finish conditions of course it has to<br>be<br>site specific in that way that we we we<br>have certain<br>issues that are more important to to our<br>country<br>we started actually with the study of of<br>the current process<br>um to find the problems and barriers<br>kind of that we face and this study was<br>based mostly<br>uh to sorry interviews and then<br>uh interviews of central uh<br>and from this study we actually we find<br>found out<br>maybe partly obvious that of course all<br>the parties in the building process have<br>their own roles and<br>the main operator prom promoting the<br>sustainable solutions<br>is the order of the project so<br>it's the client quite often the<br>municipalities or<br>building companies<br>the key aspect for making this kind of<br>operating model more common is<br>that the customer who orders the project<br>commits to and then further commits all<br>parties of the process<br>to the defined objectives of the program<br>uh without the right state of mind and<br>the resources given by the ordering<br>party<br>the projects cannot fully uh be<br>implemented in sustainable way<br>um if this criteria has not been<br>defined at the start of the project it<br>it will not be<br>fulfilled in the following stages either<br>so<br>that's the main kind of thing uh that<br>the order is a<br>very essential role but of course in<br>addition the designers<br>um they make quite<br>kind of choices in the in the design<br>process it has impacts uh<br>what is designer have decisions that i<br>have made<br>they have impact on materials and also<br>the implementation<br>and the level of maintenance so there is<br>a major role<br>defining the sustainable decisions or<br>solutions also<br>at the stage of the construction and<br>also management or maintenance<br>phase the choice of implementation<br>techniques<br>uh the machinery uh and the way of<br>supplying materials um<br>and products and they're not it's kind<br>of a know-how<br>of for example maintenance have all<br>central effects<br>to the results and its level of<br>sustainability<br>what we also found it was<br>kind of uh it was very important to to<br>think<br>how to adopt the operating model<br>it requires first of all an in a change<br>of attitude<br>and kind of rethinking of of our<br>practices<br>at least in finland we have i think<br>maybe<br>in many other countries also there are<br>kind of<br>customary practices that has been there<br>for many many years and there are people<br>who<br>just think that okay this is the way we<br>have always done it so we will do it<br>in the future but what that's one of the<br>reasons we wanted to have these<br>workshops<br>that we wanted to have people<br>there to understand the the meaning of<br>this work and<br>also to somehow take it to their own<br>um and kind of understand<br>and be aware of the objectives that have<br>been placed<br>uh we also think that this kind of<br>continuous updating of knowledge is<br>necessary<br>um i know also kind of openly share<br>sharing this information for example<br>this<br>this model is open it's free it's not i<br>mean it's free for everybody to<br>from the website to look at um<br>and then of course cooperation and<br>participating all the actors as widely<br>as possible<br>it's kind of a the promoting of the<br>whole<br>now i will just shortly go through the<br>themes<br>this um model actually presents<br>um in five different themes uh<br>the first concentrate uh on the site<br>specific conditions so<br>water water and soil and vegetation and<br>the<br>third one is about the use of raw<br>ingredients<br>the material and products and the two<br>last concentrate<br>on well-being of the environment and<br>also<br>the people<br>um so just to see or kind of give that<br>the whole picture of the content of the<br>projects i'm not going to go through all<br>of these but<br>you can see that the first part kind of<br>contains the general operating<br>principles and then these five themes<br>and<br>as an attachment actually we we went<br>through<br>the current legislation and quality<br>requirements that we have and kind of<br>study the gaps and<br>the needs for changes um<br>so my idea is now to go through the<br>themes and just now this is not working<br>anywhere okay<br>uh so all the themes uh contain this<br>that<br>there's a main objectives and then<br>there's like operating principles and<br>actions uh for all the phases<br>the first theme is the operating<br>principles for the fostering of the<br>water conditions<br>so it is about the site<br>idea is to encourage to safeguard<br>the aquatic ecosystem services of the<br>site<br>and also the guide to locate<br>construction in such a way for example<br>that the ecological operations<br>of flood areas and the operations of<br>sensitive<br>aquatic ecosystems are safeguarded they<br>also provide guidelines for restoration<br>of aquatic ecosystems and the management<br>of storm waters<br>also there is a objective of reduction<br>there are the all the operating<br>principles<br>um and then i could<br>give you some examples maybe because we<br>we<br>in this project we also collected and<br>also after it was finished we also<br>kind of promote uh all the<br>municipalities<br>companies to to um<br>oh we have opened the website so they<br>can suggest a project<br>that has maybe been implemented<br>following the model or<br>fulfil filling maybe partly the criteria<br>so here are some some projects just very<br>shortly<br>this is one storm water wetland in<br>helsinki<br>and this is a kind of a triangle a small<br>park<br>where it's situated uh a bit north from<br>helsinki<br>city center and this wetland is actually<br>cleaning and retaining a lot of the<br>storm waters from a<br>big built area north from from the from<br>the park and before it's led to the<br>latte bay which is on the southern<br>side of this park uh<br>it's also been because it was situated<br>on an old<br>historical park it of course it needs to<br>take into account the cultural history<br>and the landscape values of<br>then the theme too this is<br>concerning soil and vegetation and then<br>promoting the retention of the healthy<br>and soil and vegetation and the<br>restoration and management of soil<br>there is also like guidance provided in<br>the protection of valuable<br>or original vegetation also the use of<br>vegetation<br>suitable for the site and then<br>management of invasive species<br>and in addition there is also used to<br>promote the retention and increase of<br>biomass<br>so material of living<br>origin and here are the<br>principles and we decide specific<br>operating principles meaning the first<br>and the second themes<br>the meaning of mapping of the existing<br>existing circumstances on the site and<br>the design<br>and construction and maintenance kind of<br>accordingly is emphasized<br>defining different protective zones<br>maybe<br>and diminishing harms and distraction<br>requires setting of new priorities<br>also during construction and maintenance<br>phases<br>the central actions are pre-designed of<br>the construction site for example<br>and the protection of the site and also<br>in addition uh developing the<br>maintenance plan<br>according uh the sustainable solutions<br>and through<br>identifying the values and the features<br>of the site<br>the concern construction and maintenance<br>aim to nature based solutions<br>and through that to increase<br>here is a project uh thick river park<br>is uh it's actually a project that<br>started with the invitational<br>competition and the<br>winner of that competition was loki<br>landscape architects<br>um entry called oasis and this is built<br>on an idea<br>kind of emphasizing the site values and<br>and using the<br>existing features of vegetation<br>and water as a starting point about<br>creating kind of a new outdoor living<br>space for the residents of a bc urban<br>center uh<br>want is the city very next to helsinki<br>and in the capital area of helsinki<br>there was um you can maybe see the main<br>picture was also in the<br>beginning of this lecture they were<br>opening kind of<br>embankment of the river and restoring<br>the natural<br>and flow of the river uh and it's four<br>nines one was<br>one of the changes that has been already<br>made<br>there is also uh several features in<br>this park<br>a river park and one of them is this uh<br>orbic area that includes a park with a<br>playground and<br>i just took this uh because of um<br>there's like two things here<br>uh one is partly about the water uh<br>there's like um<br>a huge storm water pipe actually coming<br>from the center<br>from uh that collects like waters from<br>storm waters from 25 hectares of area<br>close by and it's it's taken to this<br>park and there is um<br>under the kind of viewing deck of this<br>park there is a<br>sand bio coal filter that holds and<br>cleans<br>this the water and there will be<br>some information kind of<br>signs coming to this shore to explain<br>about it and then there is this<br>uh playground which is mostly<br>the idea is also to kind of use use the<br>water and then<br>they're pumping water up and the<br>children can play with that<br>but then you can see that the building<br>site was very<br>demanding and despite these heavy ground<br>works that<br>were done the one one of the tasks was<br>to keep the existing trees<br>and it i think they kind of<br>succeeded quite well with that there you<br>can also see that<br>the water feature in the in the<br>playground<br>uh then to the third theme um it's<br>operating principle for the production<br>use and recycling of raw<br>this is kind of it's<br>used to encourage material effect<br>efficiency<br>the responsibility uh responsible use of<br>raw ingredients and it's supporting<br>ecologically sustainable materials and<br>sapling production<br>and also uh there is the idea of<br>limitation and sorting of waste<br>produced in construction and also<br>recycling and reuse of materials<br>also there is a idea that you should<br>prefer local producers and manufacturers<br>these principal con principles concern<br>especially kind of setting<br>target levels uh compared to the normal<br>level for example<br>with reducing emissions and energy use<br>water use or the amount of waste and<br>then also<br>informing about the objectives so<br>if there's a target levels that you're<br>kind of sharing<br>to all collaborators and actors<br>and supporting the sustainable working<br>culture you can<br>set like new target levels<br>to all parties of the process also those<br>who actually not<br>maybe haven't been selected to the<br>project but<br>but might be might want to be selected<br>in the future<br>central principles is also that the<br>collaborators<br>with sustainable production values and<br>documented environmental<br>aspects are preferred and also the<br>meaning of local<br>actors safety healthiness and justice<br>and equality<br>uh here there's a just shortly about the<br>case<br>of helsinki city uh in helsinki there's<br>uh since year 2014<br>there has been actually a kind of a<br>special post of a coordinator<br>who is coordinating the lands land<br>masses and the spoils in<br>in the area the coordinator is kind of<br>following<br>the the question of land and soil masses<br>at the city level<br>and the target is to use all uh use and<br>recycle all<br>uh land masses within the city<br>and you can see there is like the amount<br>of<br>of land that has been recycled and also<br>the money that has been saved<br>there is a couple of projects uh<br>uh one of them this is a very first one<br>actually that was<br>a landfill i think they started with<br>this one already like<br>before 2010<br>uh and this is an old waste tip in<br>the eastern part of helsinki it kind of<br>received all the<br>land materials and the surface topsoil<br>from<br>all areas of helsinki where excavating<br>was needed<br>and this 40 hectares area is nowadays<br>very popular<br>kind of a look outside and collection of<br>many kind of biotopes<br>if you are in helsinki area you should<br>visit<br>quite interesting uh then there is<br>another<br>project um this allakivy park which is<br>also<br>located in located in the eastern<br>helsinki area<br>this is also a former waste tip of<br>mullipura<br>which was started already 1950s<br>until 1960s um and this park is a result<br>of this helsinki recycling of land<br>project<br>for sure it has been built uh on<br>on the criteria of ecological<br>sustainability and follows this helsinki<br>resource<br>wise strategy just some pictures<br>for you to see in the 70s the area for<br>some reason<br>they were they had built houses and<br>housing on top of this<br>old uh landfill<br>uh and and then there was like blocks of<br>flats and these houses were knocked down<br>in 2001<br>when they they found out there is like<br>environmental pollution<br>that was kind of observed observed at<br>the area in 1998<br>and then they had a remediation of this<br>polluted ground that was finished in<br>2010<br>but this allakivi park has been<br>built totally with recycled land and<br>soil and<br>their work has done with kind of a<br>sludge<br>uh soil coming from harbor uh new harbor<br>that was<br>very close by and also the recycled soil<br>from<br>uh recycled topsoil of forest land<br>that's something and using the seed bank<br>of the soil<br>is quite common nowadays with<br>with the park projects there's some<br>figures you can see<br>uh just take a sip of water still you<br>you<br>you can read that figures how how kind<br>of<br>and i think this is the kind of the most<br>important argument that we can have<br>when when we change the way of thinking<br>actually<br>it's really kind of um if you think<br>about the budgets and the<br>economical side there is a lot of gains<br>then there's a theme four which is<br>concerning<br>energy saving air quality and<br>environmental protection that<br>focuses on the reduction of different<br>emissions and<br>they misreduce greenhouse gases<br>the loss of habitats and the negative<br>these principles are connectedly<br>connected mostly with optimizing the<br>actions<br>and using the alternative energy<br>resources and production<br>and also adopting more environmentally<br>this is one uh just like for example to<br>use a new electric machinery<br>and devices that now have been started<br>to come to the market quite<br>a lot but also the kind of decisions of<br>of design<br>and uh concerning the maintenance no<br>need to cut the lawn<br>all over uh for example the picture on<br>the<br>on the left is from oslo park where<br>where most of the sides of the lawn has<br>been left<br>uncut and to to be developed as a<br>then there's the fifth team the last one<br>um this is um the principles concerning<br>the promotion of<br>of health and well-being they are mainly<br>related to social sustainability<br>are used to support fostering of the<br>values of cultural<br>environments the accessibility<br>safety and comfort of green areas and<br>also the equal opportunities to all<br>users<br>these principles they relate to<br>identifying the needs and solutions<br>then also participating local<br>communities and specialists<br>here in finland quite uh kind of<br>um popular thing nowadays is a city<br>gardening<br>well i don't know we we don't have such<br>a<br>kind of urban cities but still there is<br>a<br>the green areas they play an important<br>role in mental recovery and also place<br>for physical activities that promote<br>health of course<br>in these times that we've had during the<br>late half year a bit more<br>we have seen how how important the green<br>areas are<br>um of course these locations<br>uh uh are also supporting this kind of<br>social interactions and strengthening<br>the sense of community<br>so and also by supporting the local<br>economy for example by using local labor<br>and materials these local communities<br>and their operations are developed<br>uh okay this slide is already finished<br>but i just want to have it as a that i<br>remember to say that we<br>we really did this kind of um operating<br>uh going through this um operating<br>principles we also went through the<br>the legislation and like quality<br>requirements and studied the gaps and<br>needs<br>we have a website unfortunately in<br>finnish<br>i think we have only one document in in<br>english<br>but what we then no i don't know why<br>this is not always showing the things<br>but<br>we made this kind of um there is a kind<br>of a<br>report uh you could say it's more maybe<br>a manuscript for the web<br>page content but uh we also then<br>afterwards started to make this kind of<br>a<br>very simple lists for this is for like<br>for a client<br>uh what kind of rules or or kind of a<br>general level thoughts<br>uh that should be taken into account<br>we made that one also for a designer um<br>what kind of major things and<br>kind of general level uh things to be<br>thought if you want to have a project<br>thinking uh it's also done for the<br>landscapers and for the<br>management i'm sorry this is in finnish<br>i will just<br>skip this and then we also made this<br>kind of a um<br>you could say kind of um<br>checklists and instructions that kind of<br>very practical<br>things for to be used on the site<br>and then also like a list of<br>uh rules for everybody in the field<br>who are working with the landscape<br>uh field<br>yeah that was all a lot of a lot of<br>words<br>um but well i'm ready to<br>uh answer some questions if you have any<br>thank you emilia for<br>such an inspiring lecture in in getting<br>to know<br>um something that general landscape<br>architects are not that excited about<br>which is the construction of things um<br>while i will i will allow people to<br>formulate their questions and i think i<br>have one<br>to open up the discussion and<br>while while he went through all of these<br>and since it was quite<br>an extensive and thorough process um and<br>looking back now<br>at where we are uh how do you think that<br>landscape practices<br>have reacts to these and are they<br>adopting<br>uh these practices and how<br>is the landscape construction industry<br>also<br>looking at all these uh operational<br>model<br>are are they on board or are you feeling<br>there's some skepticism or hesitation<br>around these well i think<br>both that as i said that there is like<br>skepticism and hesitation<br>because there are kind of ways of<br>working that have been<br>there for such a long time that it's<br>kind of<br>hard to change your ways of doing but<br>i'm thinking but then<br>i can also think see another point of<br>view which is<br>mostly uh coming from the the economic<br>thinking that they see that you can<br>actually really save a lot<br>i feel that the municipalities and the<br>cities are very<br>interested about this work also and i<br>know that for example in in tampere area<br>they are kind of developing this<br>model for for themselves to make like<br>more<br>maybe detailed rules for for their own<br>when they are kind of<br>ordering work or design or or then<br>construction that they<br>they are making more precise rules uh<br>which are kind of based on this model<br>and i'm very happy for that because<br>in this work it was a huge project for<br>such a kind of a small group to handle<br>and then of course there was a lot of<br>things that i<br>felt that were staying in a two general<br>level but it was very important to have<br>that level<br>somehow put together in one one one kind<br>of<br>report or or people to so<br>at least i feel that in finland people<br>are very interested about this<br>and i i think the reason is that we have<br>this<br>umbrella organization who is kind of uh<br>really<br>like letting people know about it it has<br>been like<br>at least two years it has been a very<br>central topic in our<br>seminars but i guess that maybe then<br>the kind of a problem or the kind of<br>something that we should do<br>better is to somehow catch<br>the uh building companies i mean<br>that are are not the landscapers because<br>they kind of know already<br>but we have the ones who are ordering<br>the work from the landscapers like the<br>bigger companies<br>and for them this kind of thinking is<br>fairly new<br>so i'm talking about like infrastructure<br>building<br>roads and so on so like this hardscape<br>kind of yeah so<br>but i feel well i will give the same<br>lecture to<br>elka which is uh the european<br>association of<br>landscape constructors uh on friday<br>and i really hope that and i understood<br>that they are very interested<br>of course you can say that there is a<br>lot of companies who are<br>interested to develop their ways of<br>working but then there are a lot of them<br>that who are not or kind of<br>maybe don't have the energy of the<br>interest<br>but i think the the thing that you can<br>gain something<br>economically it's actually the thing<br>that is changing<br>with arguments the argument should be<br>economical<br>yeah and every single change<br>in the practice of landscape<br>architecture in finland um<br>our practices our practices adopting<br>the operating module more and more yeah<br>i think<br>more and more uh of course i can see<br>that kind of<br>for if i'm thinking about landscape<br>architects and designers we kind of<br>this is something that we based our work<br>in is kind of ecological and ethical<br>and social sustainability they are so<br>i don't know the word in english now but<br>then i mean they're kind of very<br>important uh values for us<br>so for us i think this is not a new<br>thing of course but<br>we can use it and i i think when<br>when the municipalities or the cities<br>adopt this system<br>it's much easier to make a design for<br>them which is<br>following the principles and you don't<br>have to kind of<br>be the one who's telling them that come<br>on you should<br>you should do it that this way or but<br>they already know<br>and it there's like a lot of pressure of<br>course<br>politically now and we have a<br>and we have a new legislation for the<br>storm water management for example<br>so it's already in the law that you have<br>to use these nature based<br>solutions like as a first choice<br>that so we are trying to we are trying<br>to achieve<br>that this could go to the like legal<br>level uh and of course then it will<br>work more kind of going down<br>so that's one of our goals has been and<br>that's why we<br>we went through the legislation that is<br>there at the moment and<br>we try to find the gaps that all kind of<br>problems and we already<br>knew from the interviews of of the um<br>operators that there are like<br>some very very stupid like ways of<br>doing things just because the<br>legislation is actually preventing us of<br>doing it in a wise<br>way right so so we try to kind of<br>go around this topic in a different<br>levels but it's a very slow process of<br>course<br>can you imagine especially when you<br>include politics and legislation<br>okay so open open the floor to our<br>participants<br>and if there is any question uh feel<br>free to<br>unmute yourself and ask directly to<br>emilia<br>or if you feel a little a little more in<br>a shy side<br>you can also type your question and we<br>anyone if they're silent i would like to<br>maybe ask about<br>the situation like for example in new<br>zealand<br>or it's kind of a topic somehow uh<br>you know present on the discussion or is<br>it just<br>yeah well i can i can see i can see<br>here a couple of people that may be very<br>interested to answer that question<br>yes i'm here hi steve<br>do you want i i know that you are a<br>little more involved on these in new<br>zealand<br>um do you want to answer emilia's<br>question<br>yeah um i was going to send a<br>query um and that new zealand has<br>that focuses on<br>the efficiencies of buildings and is<br>more for the architects there is<br>some environmental<br>way of assessing the<br>energy efficiency of buildings<br>but it doesn't really address uh<br>landscape very much there is some water<br>processes a bit of land use whether it's<br>taking up a a green<br>space or whether it's a noria<br>brownfields site but<br>the the landscape side of it is pretty<br>well<br>deficient and um we haven't really<br>looked at although there are ways of um<br>incorporating sustainable<br>water processes and the likes<br>we don't have a coordinated um<br>industry sort of<br>group that is looking into that and<br>that's something that perhaps the<br>institute of landscape arctis here<br>combining with the landscape industries<br>group<br>could look at so developing something<br>because<br>we don't have that focus on our it's<br>more<br>or um green star of um<br>levels for the buildings as such so<br>i i found it really useful as the way<br>you process that you went<br>through and incorporating all those<br>various people who are involved in<br>the landscape design and construction<br>process and and your point that<br>involves the person<br>the individual who is commissioning the<br>work<br>using ensuring that they are involved<br>in the process and committed to it<br>so that all parties are<br>at the same goal so i i wondered whether<br>do you have<br>architects in finland who<br>are involved and integrated in your<br>process or are they a separate one as<br>well<br>uh yeah architects were not a part of<br>this process but uh we have a very close<br>connections to the to the field<br>um and i know that we have a big we had<br>a<br>bit of a similar situation that you had<br>like<br>before this project that we it was<br>mostly<br>all the kind of assessments<br>criteria or kind of this kind of<br>operating models were mostly uh<br>concentrating<br>architecture and houses and buildings<br>and and about this kind of energy<br>efficient uh<br>questions uh we did not<br>take the architects uh to these and i<br>don't actually<br>i think it would be maybe a good idea to<br>to have them but they were not part of<br>this kind of um<br>the association that started this<br>project project<br>um but we are now i know that there is<br>like uh<br>in the ministry of environment there is<br>uh<br>they are developing like uh one model<br>also<br>that actually takes this somehow<br>partly in inside of their new model and<br>there is<br>uh buildings are are kind of<br>and then also um like<br>land use planning is kind of also taken<br>so there is like<br>more larger scale and coming down to the<br>the city scale and so on so but<br>for me i feel that quite often these um<br>kind of models as i thought all<br>sustainable<br>sites was very good uh like a framework<br>for us there was a lot of like<br>criteria and also content that we<br>kind of used but but i feel that it they<br>always a bit left on the general level<br>and and i<br>i feel that we also a bit we're left on<br>the general level but i'm very happy to<br>see that now some cities are<br>as i mentioned are kind of developing<br>this further and<br>and our idea is that we can then share<br>the information<br>that when we get more like best<br>practices type of<br>of sharing it on the website but yeah<br>well we we didn't uh<br>have the architects uh association<br>in in the in the inside the project but<br>i know that there are<br>some who are who have kind of heard<br>about it<br>and are interested and and possibly we<br>should<br>talk more about it for them too<br>yes i i think i wonder whether um<br>incorporating um<br>urban design and planners that um<br>because they start that process of<br>development um and broadening<br>the the um group to include those types<br>people<br>would be of abuse yeah<br>thank you steve for stepping in and<br>thank you emilia<br>um do we have any other questions<br>um perhaps we we're going to stay here<br>emilia um and i would like to<br>thank you for connecting all the way<br>from finland<br>and to share your time and your<br>knowledge with us<br>um it's very interesting to see you know<br>the other side of things what happens<br>beyond design<br>and how can we make our projects far<br>more sustainable<br>and and i think um<br>it's a long process but i think it's all<br>worth it and and hopefully and<br>more countries can adopt a similar<br>strategy as finland has<br>oh yeah i'm just seeing someone and<br>was asking about the the recording of of<br>this<br>of this uh lecture um<br>so thank you for that thank you for<br>connecting and thank you<br>for sharing this very interesting<br>lecture um<br>and i hope to see most of you for our<br>last<br>thinkers and doers of the year which<br>will be in two weeks from now<br>um and um<br>meanwhile i hope that you all stay sound<br>and safe and<br>have a good day or a good evening<br>wherever you are<br>best okay thank you<br>it's a pleasure thank you
