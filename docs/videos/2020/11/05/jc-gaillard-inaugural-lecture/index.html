who don't know me my<br>name is john hosking i'm the<br>dean of science here at the university<br>of auckland it's my very great pleasure<br>to welcome you to the inaugural lecture<br>lecture of jc gayard this is the fifth<br>attempt that jc's had to<br>have as an organ lecturer so you could<br>consider it an an exercise in<br>dictionary definitions hint that<br>professors are first and foremost<br>teachers<br>however we academics often take teaching<br>for granted<br>or treat it as a required sideline to<br>pursue a passion research<br>jc is going to offer a plea for<br>re-centering teaching in our academic<br>careers<br>and in professorship in particular by<br>way of example we will focus on how to<br>foster students participation<br>in learning as a rewarding experience<br>for not only teaching but also research<br>and service<br>to our disciplines and broader society<br>excuse me jc was a formerly member a<br>member of the faculty of the<br>university of the philippines dolmen<br>before becoming a senior lecturer in<br>geography at the university of auckland<br>he trained as a geographer at the<br>university of de savoie in chambery<br>with a particular interest in disaster<br>risk reduction<br>in asia and the pacific his work focuses<br>on inclusion<br>and inclusion and power and disaster<br>risk reduction<br>includes developing participatory tools<br>and i see some of them<br>sitting on the edges of the benches here<br>and for engaging minority groups into<br>disaster risk reduction with an emphasis<br>on ethnic and gender minorities<br>prisoners children and homeless people<br>i'm also looking at this some lego as<br>well<br>jc collaborates in participatory dr<br>training with local governments<br>ngos and other civil society<br>organizations<br>so please join me and welcome welcoming<br>i'm surprised to be honest to see so<br>many people here<br>i wasn't expecting that especially after<br>the fifth attempt<br>i mean one of the thing is that uh i<br>think i'm kind of realizing the<br>significance of the moment here and it's<br>a bit<br>i mean odd and interesting for someone<br>who got educated in<br>in a country where there's no such thing<br>as a graduation ceremony<br>so imagine an immigrant lecturer except<br>for the prestigious uh collective fronts<br>where they have this kind of<br>otherwise it's nothing<br>so i was kind of uh in the dark before i<br>got to<br>receive the brief from the vc about what<br>these lectures were about<br>so i kind of searched the wind<br>watched a few of these lectures here<br>elsewhere in new zealand i watched some<br>in the uk as well<br>and i realized that most of them if not<br>all of them actually<br>were about the teaching career and the<br>teaching achievements of uh<br>the new professor and i was kind of okay<br>is it what being a professor is about<br>is it all about the brilliance of the<br>research that we conduct<br>or is there more than that and<br>initially i thought of doing something<br>on my research talking about<br>disasters and effort now it's going to<br>be boring anyway no one wants to hear<br>about disasters<br>everyone knows our field is uh<br>reinventing the wheel all the time it's<br>under theorized and there's not much to<br>talk about in that space<br>so um one of the things i want to do now<br>that i'm a professor<br>is anyway i want to focus most<br>at least some of my research into<br>teaching and i want to research teaching<br>and learning<br>so i thought that could be a good kind<br>of a springboard for that<br>to uh focus this lecture on on teaching<br>and how teaching is valued within our<br>broader academic<br>uh life so hopefully this is going to be<br>what<br>i ah gonna discuss i'm not gonna be<br>um looks too many mics sorry<br>um i think<br>i'm i'm somehow if you're here probably<br>uh<br>preaching to the converted so i guess<br>that what i'm going to discuss here<br>i mean applies to the whole to the<br>broader community of academics more than<br>than us here in this in this tfl now<br>before we get started i'm sure you ex<br>you don't expect to remain sitting<br>and and listen for the whole hour right<br>you couldn't<br>so uh there will be a few things<br>happening i'm actually quite excited<br>about one of these<br>uh we're gonna stop at one one of my<br>favorite<br>activities see i don't have any flip<br>shot papers you're not gonna move<br>anywhere in the future<br>surprising maybe uh we're gonna start<br>with uh<br>what we call one of these uh one word<br>activity so you must have somewhere<br>towards the end of the uh<br>the tables you have some small pieces of<br>paper<br>and and markers just in case you<br>came to a lecture entrepreneur without<br>the pin um<br>so i would like you to<br>i would like you to put uh one word you<br>associate to the word professor only one<br>word the first thing that comes to your<br>mind<br>sorry just yeah just yes one<br>piece of paper each one word each the<br>first thing that comes to your mind<br>when you hear the word professor what<br>yes including you tonight yes<br>okay and when you're done if you could<br>come down move around<br>and uh stick your words up on the wall<br>so we've got one station here<br>and there are few pieces of masking tape<br>hopefully it gets you moving after the<br>glass<br>i haven't been<br>okay<br>right here specialist renowned<br>leader attitude trouble smart<br>overpaid trouble<br>very smart rank intellectual<br>passion man expert stuffy<br>label yeah can you have a quick look at<br>what's there if there's anything else<br>that hasn't come up we've got<br>whiteness a researcher<br>brain specialty wise male privilege<br>okay that's interesting to be honest<br>first time i did this with that question<br>i didn't know what to expect<br>it's not what i was expecting but that's<br>interesting uh<br>a huge diversity of uh words i mean<br>many referring to either culminating in<br>terms of<br>statue or architectural achievement<br>or behind the grants make it a lot<br>uh and this kind of things and the age<br>i was expecting some of you at least to<br>refer to<br>research more explicitly even<br>more have mentioned being a teacher than<br>a than a researcher<br>it's maybe because the lecture is<br>somehow pitched like this in the first<br>place<br>uh which is fair enough but that's<br>interesting so<br>after i watched these a few lectures<br>from from<br>elsewhere new zealand overseas i got to<br>look at the dictionaries and what they<br>say about<br>becoming uh or being a professor and<br>it's about being a teacher in the first<br>place for most of the dictionary<br>definitions<br>and the research is literally never<br>mentioned<br>anywhere and<br>obviously it's not here but he pointed<br>to me a few<br>weeks ago that the etymology of the tour<br>is about<br>profession right so it's about lecturing<br>in the first place i mean it's it's in<br>the term itself i was looking at<br>something like myself and looking at<br>this kind of enlightenment<br>um encyclopedia and that by<br>vido and denova refers to uh back in the<br>mid<br>18th century in europe it was about<br>giving a lecture in a chair and the<br>definition was referring to england<br>where<br>in particular these professors<br>hold a sort of title attached to a<br>popular film or discipline<br>that they teach but it's about teaching<br>in the first place<br>now if we look at these and many of you<br>know and i'm not a big fan of these<br>quantitative data and surveys and<br>questionnaires<br>i mean we did it all of us did it last<br>year for<br>um uh for the uni remember this teaching<br>culture<br>survey that we had to do so it's<br>actually part of the border this team<br>uh worldwide for 21 universities i think<br>mostly<br>uh in western countries but not all the<br>world series i think in malaysia<br>and and we're in africa as well uh and<br>if we look at what<br>seems to be value at least from our<br>point of view when we apply the<br>promotion<br>to become a professor it must be the<br>research and we want that to change<br>according to the<br>the survey is up we want teaching to<br>have more evidence but still we<br>consider that teaching is of a lesser<br>importance than<br>than research and and there's two things<br>on the right hand side<br>and i will call service hereafter are<br>kind of<br>marginal somehow in our um academic life<br>so this is what i want to discuss from<br>now on is to look at teaching<br>in the context of our broader academic<br>life and what i'm going to call<br>the three pillars of academic life so<br>including research and<br>and service to our discipline and<br>service to our field and<br>service to to the university of the<br>institution where we<br>um where we teach and how teaching<br>kind of places within that kind of<br>broader<br>space um<br>i want your thoughts again about this<br>we're gonna do it in a different way<br>i'm not sure if you all have a device<br>now we're gonna try to do a small<br>um antique quiz just to get your feeling<br>about<br>how do they these three pillars matter<br>in your own academic life including for<br>uh for students and and phd<br>phd students oops yes<br>so if you log in uh to mentee.com the<br>cut<br>should show up yes 50 40 25.<br>there's only one question so it's<br>basically about<br>raising the importance i leave it up to<br>you<br>to define importance because in terms of<br>time you can do it in terms of<br>commitment if it's in terms of um<br>i'm not sure that the passion you have<br>for the acceptance<br>uh after you you rate them from uh<br>one to five and that<br>should show up through this uh<br>okay i haven't counted how many of us<br>okay it looks pretty balanced 30 people<br>who have answered 31<br>it looks pretty balanced uh<br>interestingly teaching comes<br>ahead of research which i wasn't<br>expecting but that's interesting<br>and that's probably a reflection of um<br>the carrier stage we are at in our own<br>academic life and i'm gonna talk about<br>my own experience uh for a moment and<br>how these three things have mattered at<br>different points<br>of time throughout my own personal<br>career<br>um okay should go back to the power bi<br>oops sorry um<br>oops<br>so that is my case i wasn't trained to<br>be a teacher i never got<br>any single pedagogy class in my whole<br>life<br>it was all on the spot learning and<br>that's<br>what i call the steep learning peer<br>about teaching when you become an<br>academic you haven't been trained to do<br>so<br>and you have to learn how to lecture and<br>and you have immediately to prepare a<br>lot of<br>a lot of lectures and that takes i mean<br>it was taking most of my time for the<br>first few years of my career<br>so most of my attention was uh geared<br>towards<br>delivering lectures and making sure that<br>managers would be appreciated by<br>uh my students but then after a few<br>um a few years when you settle in the<br>job<br>there's a kind of sort of routine stage<br>that settles in<br>uh you realize that you can show up in a<br>theater without much preparation<br>and behavior election which is good<br>enough to capture the student's<br>attention<br>uh but that's i mean i think i've<br>experienced that i'm not sure about all<br>of us<br>and i think i mean if we look at who<br>attends these um<br>former clear events for example a clear<br>yearly conference or the conferences the<br>the things the workshops we organize at<br>the faculty level<br>i would say that must it's not again i'm<br>pretty<br>researchers and uh<br>professional teaching fellows and the<br>further you go in your career the less<br>i'm not too wrong about this um so<br>there's this kind of a voting<br>and and teaching becomes a sort of<br>sideline we take it for granted and<br>we carry on uh focusing on our research<br>and service because we have to do<br>service<br>for promotion when i return to that<br>afterwards and<br>um in my particular case um<br>i found this kind of real interest for<br>uh for teaching<br>i was when i came here so i'm grateful<br>to be uni for that<br>i kind of found this sort of new passion<br>for teaching around 2011-2012<br>things have changed and i'm gonna return<br>to that in in a moment<br>i was kind in i've been sitting in this<br>kind of routine stage for for quite a<br>while at least for five six years in my<br>career<br>and i think again this is this is<br>and this is largely uh driven by<br>i think how we look at teaching so as<br>long as<br>we usually meet these three qualities<br>with a good feature<br>which is to be uh passionate if you're<br>passionate in the theater then<br>your students are going to rate you<br>highly and and you're going to deliver<br>your message<br>going to come across probably if you're<br>an editor about the topic<br>and if you are organized in your course<br>and you will meet the expectations of<br>the uni when it comes to promotion and<br>when it comes to um<br>to achieving what is expected from you<br>in the atr or whatever<br>accountability mechanisms we have at the<br>end and<br>the second thing is that if on top of<br>this our teaching is research live<br>then ah yeah we meet all the<br>requirements we take all the boxes and<br>we can<br>again uh take teaching as a sort of<br>sideline<br>i feel to uh resulting in its research<br>teaching it's not uh teaching-led<br>research right we don't have such a<br>thing and teaching levels we don't have<br>such a thing as a<br>teaching and study for example right we<br>give more out<br>to them but we give more value i mean to<br>the research side of things<br>i'm not saying i mean this is this is a<br>bit like a guy i mean obviously we have<br>people we have students who do research<br>and then follow their teaching i mean<br>our research is often informed by our<br>service but somehow it's it's<br>uh all about the search kind of guiding<br>the process i mean our services service<br>our discipline<br>first and foremost about being on board<br>with journals it's about<br>reviewing proposals about organizing<br>performances<br>so it's kind of a research driving the<br>whole process<br>and again i mean teaching being<br>on the side so as long as we tick all<br>these boxes then we're kind of<br>fine in our career and and<br>we sail through without too much trouble<br>when it comes to promotion or<br>or meeting the requirements of things<br>now this challenge for me in 2011-12<br>and i would be forever very confused<br>who's here because the weapon taught me<br>how to do a teaching philosophy<br>and i didn't know what it was before in<br>fact there was no such thing as a<br>teaching philosophy that you had to do<br>and i mean to me it was a kind of spark<br>because i had to kind of realize what i<br>was doing and why i was doing it<br>when we started this crazy course with<br>alice especially<br>um i mean things were kind of coming<br>together in my mind<br>and this is now how i pitch my my<br>teaching philosophy and the contents<br>that are of importance as such for this<br>this lecture here but what i realized uh<br>while i was developing this is that all<br>these guys here i mean gramsci fairy<br>rancier<br>and chambers are the people i use<br>in my research there are the people i<br>use to inform my<br>service my work with ngos my i mean<br>the workshops were organized so we used<br>to organize the faculty from the school<br>so i realized that teaching was actually<br>and everything was coming together it<br>was a whole when we were trying to do<br>something<br>in the teaching space that was informing<br>our research as much as our research was<br>informing our teaching<br>so there was this kind of<br>epistemological underpinning that was<br>common to everything we<br>do and i say we're with my students uh<br>when we teach in in<br>in this interactive way that that we do<br>so it was all coming together and i<br>realized that when i had to give up this<br>teaching philosophy<br>now it's not anymore teaching philosophy<br>for me it's kind of an academic<br>philosophy<br>it's something which is which is<br>enveloping everything and i think<br>that that's crucial because i realized<br>that i mean teaching would not be more<br>side eye it wasn't anymore something i<br>was kind of doing<br>because i had to do it and i was doing<br>it probably okay<br>but it was not something i was kind of<br>looking<br>as part of this kind of whole and that<br>was crucial<br>and now this is how i look at my<br>academic<br>life somehow uh so it's not any more<br>research driven as it chooses i don't<br>pointing your blurb that introduces<br>yourself and<br>and that makes the case for you for your<br>promotion so i mean we weapon disasters<br>but that's again that's that's that's<br>not the most important here the point is<br>that<br>when we um<br>teach we sometimes hire some tools<br>students<br>realize that we find some tools with<br>them we will take into our research<br>afterwards and we'll take them to our<br>uh work with it here again or will<br>organize workshops or meetings around<br>around the uni<br>at the same time uh both of the tools<br>we've been using in research for a long<br>time<br>into into our teaching and it all comes<br>separation between these two things it's<br>it's it's a whole and again<br>what's important to me is the<br>epistemological underpinning i mean the<br>way we do that<br>is exactly the same whether it's the<br>search it doesn't matter whether it's<br>research teaching i mean we do this in<br>the same<br>in the same fashion and this is the kind<br>of things<br>i think we um we need to instill<br>and we need to develop amongst our<br>students academics and early careers<br>that towards the end but this kind of<br>holistic view of<br>our academic career not looking at<br>teaching in a cyber research matter<br>and service as another another pillar on<br>the side<br>so it all comes together well it's just<br>a few pictures i mean when<br>again what i just said but when you do<br>when we do this when we do service and<br>here i'm using an example from one of<br>these clear uh induction workshops few<br>years ago<br>uh when we do research in that<br>particular case in prison<br>uh or when we teach it's the same thing<br>we use the same tools it's the same<br>approach the same kind of<br>this energy it's the same kind of<br>theoretically<br>there's no difference so when we do one<br>thing for research before service then<br>it informs the likes because<br>there's no difference and to me that was<br>really crucial to to<br>realize that yeah teaching was i mean it<br>was a passion but because i<br>i like teaching persons because it's<br>part of this exciting<br>hall it all comes together it all goes<br>in the same<br>direction and that's probably why<br>um<br>uh anthony martin and i remember uh<br>the monday before we went into lockdown<br>number one<br>we got to know that we were going to<br>lock down we were buzzing in the<br>building<br>it was not kind of a burden looking at<br>teaching how we need to adapt that to<br>the<br>uh to the remote environment it's gonna<br>be i mean something that we need to do<br>just for the sake of doing it uh now for<br>us it was an opportunity to actually<br>uh do something that was going to be<br>exploratory<br>and that was going to be useful for<br>research for service and we have been<br>uh doing these kind of things that we<br>did for this particular class<br>in research since then or in service for<br>some projects<br>outside of the teaching space so it was<br>an exploratory opportunity<br>and uh it was super exciting i promise<br>and i'm one of these few people who've<br>enjoyed 2020 so far<br>i promise i feel bad about it<br>but this was super exciting new tools<br>new processes<br>new ways of engaging with the students<br>uh engaging with our partners that<br>because i mean again it was part of this<br>whole it was not kind of something we<br>were doing on top of something<br>else just for the sake of delivering<br>lectures um<br>and i'm sure if i hadn't found that kind<br>of epistemological underpinning i<br>wouldn't have<br>been excited that that much um<br>now i want you to reflect upon that<br>in my own bubble not realizing what<br>but i want to reflect about what is<br>intelligence to actually get to that<br>point where teaching is part of this<br>whole<br>and fully integrated with our research<br>and<br>um our service so you won't be using<br>flip shots<br>i promise you're gonna use lego power<br>change<br>and one of the reasons why we're using<br>lego is that we didn't want you to<br>get out of the theater at 7 00 in 7 p.m<br>because we feel people which make up<br>so we keep you in here and we're going<br>to use<br>something we've been using in research<br>in teaching and in service<br>which is legal serious play so this is<br>how it's going to work<br>you need to form groups of five to six<br>people<br>four is five to six you're gonna have a<br>base plate and a small bag<br>with bricks minifigures a few things<br>i want you to discuss hello<br>you're too excited about you're too<br>excited about the lego<br>okay wait hold up for a minute<br>uh i want you to brainstorm challenges<br>and opportunities for kind of putting<br>things together<br>but instead of writing your ideas<br>in words onto a piece of paper or a<br>post-it or whatever<br>i want you to use lego bricks to explain<br>beside it i want you to use lego bricks<br>and make a small model to actually<br>express these items i will<br>show you what i did this morning uh<br>in a few minutes right so it doesn't<br>need to be<br>very sophisticated my son told me that<br>it was rated one out of ten<br>for aesthetics when he saw it um<br>fail definitely but what i was trying to<br>capture just to give you an example i'm<br>not saying that you should do the same<br>thing but this this is meant to be an<br>academic<br>between different kind of commitments<br>and i was looking this is a uni you can<br>imagine<br>with power on top here with policies<br>uh and accountability mechanisms here<br>sitting on high upper level<br>and then you have research teaching<br>and service i my<br>my thought was okay this is difficult to<br>actually make that balance to achieve<br>that kind of 40 40 20 workload that we<br>have on paper<br>because we can't really catch up with<br>our teaching<br>at least later in our career when you<br>reach that stage of ap<br>or p because you are committed to your<br>family as well<br>that's that's meant to be the family<br>with the footsteps because you're<br>committed to your own wellbeing that's<br>the ice cream here<br>and you're committed as well i mean in<br>some cases i know nikki would emphasize<br>that<br>you're committed to the environment for<br>sure as well we can't travel as much<br>some<br>sometimes as we we<br>could because we want to not travel too<br>much for example so we can't achieve as<br>much as we could because we don't have<br>we need to be careful about our travel<br>so this is this is the the cactus here<br>right so this is what i was trying to<br>capture in this small model<br>i wanted to take maybe 10 15-ish minutes<br>to actually try to think of your own<br>small mother you're super excited i<br>i can show you this one<br>field<br>wow<br>uh<br>afterwards<br>okay<br>yes<br>happy<br>one minute so you just put down your<br>is<br>okay so let's<br>let's stop here and let's debrief maybe<br>a couple of your models<br>uh any volunteers who would like to<br>share what they've done<br>oh karen kyle's super excited could we<br>could we bring your mona<br>could we bring your model down here and<br>well the idea is that the currently that<br>the<br>um lecturer or professor or whatever is<br>stuck behind this tower of research that<br>they can't see over<br>so you can see their students are here<br>and they can't see them so they have to<br>follow the yellow brick road<br>to get around to their students who are<br>here and there's things like meaning<br>taking photographs i'm not quite sure<br>all of these things are the little steps<br>along the way to<br>being able to uh be with their students<br>oh and and that's that's the dean who's<br>in our group and he's got a stick in a<br>carrot<br>and<br>okay so this this is academic life in<br>2020<br>that's a fair assumption fair<br>description isn't it<br>so um and what this shows is this is the<br>the person<br>who's kind of not really coping with<br>life so this is the beverage you need<br>whatever that beverage is that could be<br>wine it could be coffee it could be<br>anything really<br>and then this this is the dispensing<br>thing that provides you with the wine<br>that you need<br>this is oh that's sorry the beverage<br>that you need so this<br>this is a depiction of teaching where<br>everything is on a bit of a<br>a bit precarious and the banana falls<br>off if you if you move it too much<br>um this is the path to promotion and<br>what you probably can't see is there's a<br>gap<br>so you you do all the steps to get<br>promotion and then<br>you fall do not pass go do not collect<br>200<br>and you try again so here's the illusion<br>so this is the clock tower<br>and then this this is a representation<br>of power so a broom in one hand and an<br>axe in the other<br>yes um<br>this is service and this is research<br>um so it's a little bit sort of not<br>particularly<br>proportionate this year and this is um<br>it's important to have work-life balance<br>and carving off time so we've got some<br>nature<br>and um and then a nice seat with shade<br>and boundaries it's about putting up<br>i feel like you've maximized the bricks<br>you were uh<br>we did we did i used them all it's a bit<br>of kind of a random assignment of bricks<br>but it's uh<br>that's good anyone else no burning<br>desire to share<br>ah yes so um<br>this figure here in power<br>on the it was basically the timetabling<br>office<br>so it's not the day<br>um there's just a bone left though maybe<br>it is<br>but this is kind of the stifling of of<br>teaching<br>to make it so difficult that oh you<br>decided you were going to do that last<br>year you can't change it now when you're<br>inspired and creative it's too late<br>um and this is the uh academic here<br>who has this wonderful maze and a moat<br>with um<br>frog like crocodiles um and trying to<br>get through all of the sort of<br>admin and bureaucracy that surrounds<br>teaching it takes the creativity out of<br>it<br>and the passion for people where it's<br>just a little bit too hard but we<br>and there's the sands of time here with<br>our hourglass<br>and if it doesn't run out you can get<br>the banana and you'll be very lucky<br>but we have a hopeful little tiny bridge<br>here<br>that we can get over and also if we can<br>find it it's pretty narrow but<br>also this is our the students graduating<br>so if they're lucky enough to navigate<br>all of this as well then<br>we hope that we can come out with some<br>um passionate<br>graduate students at the end so there's<br>a little bit of hope in there as well<br>how they all look different and how you<br>maximize all the weight<br>okay you go past oh we didn't nearly<br>have as good of bricks as anybody else<br>like we only have one crab we had only<br>one banana but i think most people had<br>one<br>so anyway i started with the tree i<br>wanted to be positive and i thought like<br>well that that's like nice<br>green good work-life balance and it<br>immediately hit me then and so then i<br>got the<br>and i edited the tree celebrations<br>like they keep us going right when we<br>get to celebrate our colleagues<br>and our times of the year yeah<br>keep going yeah okay so then then then<br>there's the balancing so<br>well to me it's just the person itself<br>who's balancing everything<br>uh but then um we had we had another<br>builder um<br>here who decided that it should become<br>even harder and so began<br>building the obstacle uh to make it to<br>make it very difficult<br>with the slippery side yeah specified<br>yes<br>yeah and then and then and then you put<br>up you tell about that<br>i'm not gonna name names i did have some<br>specific this is<br>uh this is a welcoming mat of things<br>that you might achieve<br>uh but then the orange light is the<br>bureaucracy<br>and the processes in the system and and<br>this is a person looking<br>and thinking oh good idea but actually<br>no red<br>no you can't do that um<br>so so a sort of a<br>welcoming but actually stopping us from<br>doing all of the things that we want to<br>do<br>yeah yeah and then there's the plate<br>with uh<br>we decided that must be a cake it was<br>not clear what the piece actually means<br>and and then there's the the drinks you<br>know could be wine looks more like<br>coffee<br>and and some other things that that are<br>that are gadget or<br>or things that you really might like and<br>and again it's a sign of hope but it's<br>on the side where<br>it's probably a no you can't there's not<br>enough money or<br>but it also is like we come together<br>today to share with colleagues and it's<br>a special treat<br>yeah yeah it's the positive first yeah<br>yeah it's the glass half<br>and this is our student with their<br>special<br>assignment idea pieces<br>fish that they're trying to get to the<br>academic um<br>yeah yeah well this was a necessity<br>because that piece doesn't actually fit<br>on here but then it felt very<br>very fitting that it should not actually<br>fit<br>anyway<br>i'll get a final bit about this<br>afterwards it's interesting that most of<br>you have emphasized obstacles<br>i yeah probably<br>now i need to acknowledge that we've<br>tried to embody<br>uh what i just talked about about using<br>teaching<br>for informing research and uh and<br>service that you've been guinea pigs<br>here<br>because we've been using lego in<br>different settings but whenever you did<br>lego uh with so many people so it was at<br>higher<br>so it's kind of a teaching led<br>experience that we're going to take into<br>into research now and into<br>uh other spaces where we there will be<br>things to improve but it's worked<br>better than we thought it would work for<br>sure so we're going to take that into<br>research now so it's trying to again use<br>teaching to<br>to inform our whole academic life and<br>not just using research to inform<br>uh other aspects of our academic life<br>now i'm gonna i'm gonna finish with<br>a few slides of uh conclusions<br>that are going to be a bit more<br>optimistic uh<br>hopefully than the new pathways um<br>i like this the tree of hope just before<br>um<br>now i think i mean<br>there's this new uh teacher at ua<br>framework which i think is is very good<br>i i like it personally very much<br>um i think it's a very good first step<br>towards<br>putting some importance and emphasizing<br>teaching now i think it's just a first<br>step<br>to me in the sense that many of our<br>colleagues again i think<br>i'm preaching to the converted here but<br>i think many of our colleagues will look<br>at this<br>and think of this more as an<br>accountability mechanism and their layer<br>of<br>uh requirements we have to meet these um<br>these expectations to be promoted to uh<br>meet the expectations of the adpr at the<br>end of the year<br>so this is a very good start provides a<br>very good theoretical framing for<br>emphasizing teaching i think<br>but we have to be careful that it<br>doesn't only come from the top<br>what i would like to uh to encourage and<br>i think it's more kind of<br>inspiration than than an agenda or<br>or a clear set of recommendations<br>more about creating and instilling that<br>kind of<br>um inner believing<br>into teaching as something which is<br>central<br>as important as research in our academic<br>life and<br>look at this not as an ad hoc<br>perspective but<br>up front when we even before we start an<br>mel and i have been talking to someone<br>from the med school<br>who is running on behalf of the uni a<br>large<br>training program for our teaching<br>assistants are gtas and tas<br>and and and my take is that we need to<br>to<br>not focus only on on delivery and<br>marking and those kind of things but<br>that we need to to create that kind of<br>broader uh understanding of teaching as<br>part of<br>um a space that includes teaching and<br>that includes<br>service at the same time and the dali is<br>something else where that could be<br>and i know it's it's being done uh<br>largely but the dali is a kind of<br>very elitist kind of thing it's 20<br>students per year so<br>i mean my take is that we should try to<br>do this at school level or department<br>level to<br>kind of create a more uh broader<br>momentum<br>i was talking to gary as well earlier<br>this afternoon about how uk ukri now<br>provide some sort of upfront training to<br>their new phd students<br>uh to to look at research more<br>um within a broader academic or future<br>academic career for those who would like<br>to carry on after the phd<br>and become academics uh so we we need i<br>think to<br>to to bring that up front and not look<br>at this only as<br>an accountability thing later uh when we<br>um when we settle in uh our positions<br>and i think uh the the final point here<br>is that<br>um i think we need to do this with our<br>students<br>and i think i mean many of you know<br>how i mean anthony uh martin thank cat<br>alice and many others have been<br>been central to these um to these um<br>uh teaching initiatives and how we've<br>been trying to develop new things<br>again for our teaching but for our<br>research and for<br>our um uh service as well so i think we<br>need to do this with our students you<br>know my usual hands<br>about the uni being run by a handful of<br>privileged white<br>male um in most cases although it<br>i think we're doing better in other<br>universities but it's a handful of<br>powerful um<br>academics running the uni on behalf of<br>how many students we have forty thousand<br>uh and students voice in all of this<br>i think is is is is i wouldn't say<br>nowhere but it's not<br>very prominent if you i mean we social<br>scientists are very good at criticizing<br>governments organizations for being<br>top-down and technocratic but when we<br>look at how we run our teaching programs<br>how many students contribute to<br>designing our curricula designing our<br>course contents designing our<br>assessments<br>we're not doing a better job right and i<br>think this is part of<br>of creating that kind of broader um uh<br>understanding of academic careers with<br>our students as a collective<br>rather than again something that stands<br>in a site on the side of our research<br>um and we look at students mostly as<br>potential researchers or<br>or texas wider as indian so i think this<br>is this is most of what i wanted to say<br>talking about students as well and many<br>of you know anthony<br>so it's as we're a celebration today<br>because anthony's just submitted his phd<br>thesis<br>and uh i know<br>he's he's he's contributed to so many<br>activities for the faculty and the<br>school that yeah it's<br>as much about his phd thesis and my<br>inaugural lecture<br>so that that was me uh we have a few<br>minutes seconds if we have lectures<br>questions i'm not sure if it's part of<br>the process<br>thanks thanks to you all for buying into<br>the lego activity right so that was<br>awesome i<br>i liked it i think it worked and who<br>knew that participating in a disaster<br>would be so much fun<br>so a good time for a couple of questions<br>so who's got<br>you can't be shy now you've got to<br>participate<br>yeah i'm going to<br>jason so you know when you're really<br>experimental in your teaching<br>there are risks with that as well as<br>obviously with benefits<br>so have you had experiences where it<br>hasn't always<br>paid off but how have you balanced that<br>out<br>uh it's always paid off in the sense<br>that we've learned from the mistakes<br>and i think most of the time when it<br>hasn't worked in what we've been doing<br>it's because there was something in the<br>process that wasn't<br>appropriate or conducive or it was more<br>the way we run the activity than the<br>activity<br>as such so we've tried to build upon<br>that and try to<br>um do it differently but i can't<br>remember anything that has<br>failed already in in the<br>past i i think that's that's that's i'm<br>trying to think at the same time here<br>but i think this is<br>because as well of um<br>the experience accumulated again in<br>service and research and because it's<br>not something we're just doing<br>out of the blue just for teaching that<br>um<br>if we're trying a new tool in teaching<br>that we haven't done in service or<br>in research um i remember doing some<br>sort of<br>um fishbone diagrams and and<br>force field analysis with students that<br>had never done before<br>but the tool is just a tool<br>and more important is the process and we<br>knew from other experiences<br>how to run activities whatever the tool<br>is<br>and that that's been the sort of<br>another question<br>thank you your comments on<br>uh phd students for example being<br>trained as teachers i think you are<br>advocating for<br>a broader academic role that we<br>introduce<br>graduate students to and i was just<br>wondering if you do involve graduate<br>students from the construction of<br>courses<br>and teaching material rather than just<br>giving them a tutorial that they<br>are meant to deliver i think that's<br>that's what's being uh<br>co-designed at the moment by the the<br>lady from the the med school<br>that's that's part of the process it's a<br>it's the lake project<br>it's a lake project so that's that's the<br>that's the game plan i think they've<br>outlined things for<br>uh looking at human the med school and<br>uh the business school or engineering<br>the business school uh and we're trying<br>to jump on this<br>initiative i'm not sure if you know jr<br>about it<br>so we're trying to see how we could make<br>that<br>work for us where we have different<br>types of<br>labs different types of tutorials<br>because most of our tears and gta still<br>are in labs and tutorials<br>i think it would be different to run a<br>med school lab than to run a social<br>science class for us right<br>so how we could try to adapt that and<br>and and build that with our students i<br>mean now we<br>for environment we have this community<br>amazing group of<br>tas and gta's who have organized<br>themselves and<br>sapphira is here anthony is here martin<br>is here<br>who are organizing themselves they are<br>running their own workshops<br>and and seminar series and and trying to<br>organize their own<br>self training that we are supporting<br>just<br>as a supporting force so i think this is<br>what we<br>we have in mind um we are doing this in<br>our courses<br>uh but again i mean it's i would say i<br>mean<br>it's probably the most risky thing we've<br>tried problem teaching which was to ask<br>india 725 to ask students to design<br>their own assignment<br>so one of my assignments is the student<br>design the assignment they do whatever<br>they want as long as it's not an essay<br>and poster<br>they design the marketing scheme by<br>themselves and they mark it by<br>themselves that is probably the<br>the riskiest thing we've done but again<br>it's worked because the<br>i think the process was not something<br>new it was like doing<br>um monitoring and evaluation work for<br>ngos more or less we took that as the<br>same kind of steps uh that we took from<br>our service in that particular case<br>um so that that again that's possible<br>and i fully<br>believe that we can do that if we want<br>to<br>so jesse you've talked about applying<br>these activities and ideas to students<br>in universities<br>different groups but but in universities<br>we create this dichotomy between<br>undergraduate teaching and postgraduate<br>teaching<br>then we complain that our postgraduate<br>teacher students<br>are not really for the way we expect<br>them to<br>step up to this new kind of<br>ourselves and we should be thinking<br>about it differently because<br>we do sort of have this undergraduate<br>and this is how we would expect them to<br>learn and engage<br>and now then magically three months a<br>few months later via this person and now<br>they come to engage and should we be<br>thinking about that<br>differently in universities i think that<br>that's<br>that's one of the bottom line issues to<br>me which is trust<br>if we don't trust the students in the<br>first place um<br>it's never going to happen and this is<br>why i mean i i use gramsci and fairy<br>because it's all about the dialogue you<br>create with the students<br>and to create a meaningful genuine<br>dialogue you need you need to trust<br>whoever you talk to and i don't think we<br>really trust our students<br>executive committee the faculty level i<br>know you were supportive back then to<br>have students on board of the exec<br>uh street four years ago uh and there<br>was a barricade<br>uh and the the committee was split i<br>think half was<br>supporting um and half was<br>blocking the process um and i think it's<br>just it's not a matter of<br>people not having good work just a<br>trusting in the first place um<br>that students can can take the lead and<br>students can design an assignment and<br>mark by themselves<br>and that's meaningful to them as much as<br>it is for us<br>i think this issue of trust i mean we<br>need to give them the opportunity we<br>need to show trust<br>and and and they are not that many<br>opportunities and spaces at the uni<br>where we can actually create that trust<br>i agree but i think to me this is<br>crucial that's the bottom line that's a<br>bottom line issue<br>trusting our students in the first place<br>that they want<br>i mean when i see with all the exams um<br>they're going to be disconnected at the<br>moment but the exams and the the trust<br>that we put<br>on our exam and our students are<br>overseas that they may cheat that they<br>may do this that they may do that i mean<br>if we don't trust them in the first<br>place i mean<br>i mean we call clever minds they call<br>clever minds<br>very much like us i think in the in the<br>union faculty<br>uh agenda they're on the same kind of<br>level of denomination but<br>do we believe that they are clever mind<br>as we are i'm not<br>it's probably a good time to finish then<br>so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
