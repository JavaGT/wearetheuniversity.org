A small room, two chairs, a white board and a whole lot of talking. How would that work for young people who have offended?<br><br>Instead, let’s follow the evidence base and build an active therapy programme over many weeks that includes a 10-day intensive wilderness therapy programme with a team of clinical psychologists like Ian Lambie...<br><br>Ian started university life wanting to be a geologist before dropping out of university and starting a career in nursing. It was from this that his interest in psychology began, as he spent time working in acute psychiatry in Dunedin, Auckland and Sydney. After training to be a clinical psychologist, Ian worked for many years in family therapy at The Leslie Centre. That led on to a decade’s work with those young people who had offended, described by many as ‘too hard’ and ‘challenging’, before accidentally ending up as an academic. His research and teaching keeps asking, What do those young people really need in Aotearoa New Zealand to improve their life outcomes? Who speaks and advocates for them?<br><br>With a career of clinical work and research in youth justice, Ian then somehow ended up associated with the Beehive, seconded part-time as a science advisor to the justice sector, and adding the question, What do the public and politicians want? What do politicians need to know? Also ‘too hard’ and ‘challenging’, he works to nudge government towards system changes aimed at improving the lives of children, adolescents and families involved in justice matters.<br><br>For more

all<br>promoted to associate professor in the<br>same round<br>about 10 years ago all of these people<br>are now full professors and several of<br>them are here and this really says<br>something about the overall strength of<br>of psychology at auckland so even though<br>i'm here representing the faculty of<br>course i'm extremely proud of the school<br>of psychology<br>fantastic well done but of course this<br>is about ian<br>ian's had a very interesting career path<br>having first attended<br>university to study geology as i<br>understand it<br>dropped out of that to become a nurse uh<br>worked in psychic psychiatric settings<br>for many years<br>uh trained as a clinical psychologist we<br>confirmed with therapy at the<br>lesley centre for quite a while<br>specialising in youth offending<br>and he rejoined the university of<br>auckland as an academic staff member in<br>1999. of course ian because he's<br>promoted to professor<br>must have a very strong research and<br>teaching record and he does<br>with about 100 publications most of<br>those being in what might be called the<br>scientist practitioner model which is<br>what<br>23 doctoral students having graduated<br>consistently excellent student<br>evaluations<br>of his teaching and indeed a dean's<br>award for sustained excellence in<br>teaching<br>ian has many other awards too but their<br>names are all too long for me to read<br>them out<br>so take it from me that ian is a highly<br>awarded<br>that said i do remember one of the<br>earliest crises that i was having to<br>deal with when i became head of<br>um of psychology was having to modify<br>a large lecture theater full of stage 2<br>students who were there<br>expecting a lecture from me and he'd got<br>though you could say that that's<br>actually testament to<br>his teaching rather than lack of<br>organisation and<br>usually when most of us don't turn up<br>they're quite pleased about that<br>they actually wanted to hear what he had<br>to say<br>but i i think the most significant<br>impact that he has had is on public<br>policy<br>and his expertise in youth justice and<br>how<br>society might better deal with youth<br>offending has led to his appointment as<br>chief science advisor in the justice<br>sector which is a<br>substantial honour i'm not going to try<br>to summarise what ian thinks about that<br>because i'm sure that's<br>largely what he's going to be telling us<br>about this evening<br>but i would say that even in these kind<br>of unusual times when<br>uh auckland university seems to have the<br>government's ear<br>and government actually seems to be<br>listening to evidence-based scientific<br>advice about things ian's influence<br>nevertheless stands out in this<br>ian and i do have an interest in cohn uh<br>it's in cricket<br>and i count every day that i don't get<br>to mention cricket as a wasted day so<br>i'll do it today<br>uh including domestic cricket we must be<br>some of the only people in the country<br>who<br>attend domestic cricket in<br>was the the sports uh psychologist or<br>mental skills trainer or whatever<br>for the auckland aces men's cricket team<br>for many years<br>so when they don't perform in it's your<br>fault<br>please join me in welcoming professor<br>thanks doug uh tenno kojo kata<br>welcome and thank you for coming along<br>clearly if you're like me you only<br>really came for one thing<br>which on this instance i wasn't actually<br>able to i decided not to have<br>the drinks but um what i'm going to do<br>is i'm going to talk about a bit of a<br>journey of mine<br>and um one of the unfortunate things<br>about university these days is they<br>record everything<br>and uh they're recording tonight<br>and they record lectures and that allows<br>you've got to be careful about kind of<br>what you say but i'm going to<br>probably just say a few things that<br>might nudge the envelope a bit and talk<br>about some things about my journey<br>some realities and also some gaps that i<br>see and some opportunities<br>so yeah i have spent 30 years<br>working with young people in the youth<br>justice system and still do<br>and i'm going to talk about their<br>journey tonight and<br>that is mount tarawera with a bun a<br>group of young people young adolescent<br>offenders that is some<br>a group of young people crossing the<br>river<br>and obviously that's the beehive so<br>i'm going to talk about really what are<br>the difference between<br>those groups of individuals and really<br>who is the most difficult and easy to<br>so really there are three key drivers<br>that have driven my<br>career um as anyone that really knows me<br>um it's cats<br>um i wasn't going to talk about my love<br>for cats rura and coco tonight but i<br>really can't go on with this lecture<br>without doing so<br>they're very very special but the<br>importance of children and families is<br>one<br>that is that are really key important<br>things if we're really going to do<br>anything different about changing<br>this world the other thing is about<br>making connections<br>connections with however with ourselves<br>as people<br>with young people with adults obviously<br>with politicians and this is a group of<br>young adolescents we were working with<br>um<br>getting them across from one side of the<br>room to another<br>and cooperating together and being<br>together<br>and not smashing each other in the face<br>so that's what we were really doing and<br>the last thing actually is realizing<br>that you know<br>we can actually make a difference we can<br>make a difference to this world we can<br>make a difference to society<br>and we can actually make a difference to<br>so i come from a place called otipoti or<br>dunedin and that is um<br>unfortunately these uh that's the need<br>not a really bad day normally the<br>weather's a lot better than that<br>and um that is uh that is the need and i<br>um from the clan lamont which is from<br>the highland of scotland and those are<br>two of my schools the third one i won't<br>mention um for a whole variety of<br>reasons and that is<br>otago university any of you i loved it<br>so much that i went a couple of times<br>the first time i only<br>lasted a couple of months and my mother<br>said to me<br>you know surely you either work or you<br>leave and i thought well<br>i think i'll leave and there was a place<br>in dunedin called the captain cook hotel<br>and they played really really good music<br>incredibly good music in those days<br>honestly from<br>you know toy love to amazing music and<br>we used to go and watch<br>that music and have the odd what i call<br>depth charger<br>and if you ever know where the dip<br>charger is it's a jug of beer that might<br>cost you four dollars and you have a<br>nipper jam bui<br>and you drop the drowned beary in and<br>the further to the bottom you get<br>so that's what i did but i dropped out<br>of university and i ended up deciding to<br>train as a nurse and<br>but before that i spent a lifetime of<br>justice in the youth justice system<br>and a friend of mine a very close friend<br>of mine sold me a car<br>and it was for a hundred bucks and that<br>taught me a few things it taught me<br>about actually practicing youth justice<br>going from there to academia and then<br>the beehive and<br>you know my car was a pretty great<br>magnet for<br>the new zealand transport police at that<br>time<br>and i can't remember the countless times<br>that we were picked up<br>by the police for minding our own<br>business doing our own thing<br>not speeding in those days because we<br>couldn't actually go very fast<br>and the police chases by the young<br>people today are 200 kilometers an hour<br>but we were barely<br>doing 30 miles an hour but sometimes we<br>and the other thing is in many of the<br>stories about<br>my interactions with the police i'm<br>certainly not going to talk about<br>because we've been recorded<br>but anyone that knows about british<br>engineering and and real cars<br>there's a car called the triumph herald<br>and the chassis is about that wide and<br>very very strong<br>and there's a there's a street in<br>dunedin and they've changed the<br>configuration of it where we used to be<br>able to actually go flying over in his<br>mother's car<br>and going fast enough and you could get<br>here<br>and so we did that on many times the<br>only trouble was<br>was that his mother when she went for a<br>warrant of fitness<br>couldn't understand why the actual<br>chassis had a crack in it and was split<br>and we said i don't know how that<br>happened<br>but it was certainly a lot of fun but i<br>realized in those days that actually<br>i wasn't targeted by the police for the<br>color of my skin<br>but i was targeted by the police for my<br>old rat bag of a car<br>my long hair and basically just being a<br>teenager<br>and that was an interesting experience<br>because what it drew to me is it drew to<br>me this thing about<br>me and the cops you know and the antics<br>that we used to get up<br>to really annoy them and get back in<br>their face<br>and if i had that experience then how do<br>the young people today experience that<br>sort of dialogue and thank god things<br>have shifted<br>and the police these days are far more<br>humanistic than they were in those days<br>but they really targeted us<br>so that was my sort of foray into youth<br>justice<br>skirmishing around some certain things<br>and doing a few certain things and i'm<br>going to talk tonight about practice<br>a wee bit of academia i'll touch on that<br>slightly<br>because where we are but then i'm going<br>to talk about a bit about the beehive<br>and how to nudge that<br>and then i trained as a nurse i trained<br>as a nurse in christchurch and nursing<br>is very good because it makes you very<br>human<br>because you you know you get very real<br>it's all a bit you you let to<br>face the reality of life you know of<br>what things are from everything for<br>helping people diet dignity delivering<br>babies dealing with people that throw up<br>pee on you and dealing up the and<br>so it makes you very very human to life<br>in the real world and it's a very good<br>learning<br>and i went to a place when i was<br>finished my registration i worked at a<br>place called cherry farm<br>and i was very very lucky i went to a<br>forensic acute<br>unit and you know you hear about sort of<br>i was very pleased i never went to<br>one of the long-term units because i<br>went to a place where the nurses were<br>very humanistic<br>they were incredibly caring in the<br>patients and it was very very good<br>nursing care they were very young<br>and i never knew about psychology or<br>psychologists whatsoever<br>until i went there and they actually<br>thought the psychologist was a bit of a<br>freak and a<br>but actually you know what i really<br>thought that actually doing something<br>human nature was a very good thing and<br>that's where it got my interest in<br>psychology<br>so i did that and then i worked in<br>general nursing and then i did part-time<br>psychology and i worked in the cute<br>psychiatry up here and<br>and also in sydney and you end up having<br>a whole breath of experience that really<br>make you it's kind of psychology really<br>really in the real world<br>so from there i thought look you know i<br>didn't want to be 50 years old and being<br>a nurse<br>you know i kind of don't know what that<br>was about so i thought well look i'll<br>try the psychology thing and i did a<br>couple of papers<br>and you know remember my first<br>sort of foray into university was drop<br>out before i did anything and so i got<br>i did these two extra mural papers i got<br>a c and a c plus and i thought well if i<br>pass i pass<br>and if i don't i knew i never had the<br>ability so i got then i thought oh<br>i could just carry on and i did a bit<br>harder i worked a bit harder i thought<br>oh yeah we'll just carry this gig<br>on you know and i ended up<br>getting getting uh into a program called<br>clinical psychology<br>and um you know i ended up<br>going to a place called auckland and<br>training in clinical psychology<br>and um i worked at a place called the<br>lesley center and did my internship<br>there and we did a whole lot of stuff<br>with kids<br>you know and and a whole lot of amazing<br>things and there was a whole lot of<br>people that<br>came before me primarily fred seymour<br>was the director<br>and and the director of the clinical<br>program but<br>a very very good therapist and<br>family therapy with kids of all walks of<br>life you know from babies that couldn't<br>feed<br>to to kids with temper tantrums<br>to youth offenders and that's really<br>what got my interest in working with<br>you know what really works how can you<br>consider letting<br>you out when you really haven't realized<br>and so what we were doing is i joined a<br>program for working with young people<br>who<br>who have harmful sexual behaviors and i<br>joined a program<br>that really would focus on combining<br>wilderness-based therapy<br>with intensive group therapy because you<br>can imagine doing imagine adolescents<br>seeing someone boring like me<br>it'll be absolutely tedious let alone<br>talking about something<br>that is so shameful about that they have<br>done that they regret<br>their family are onto them all that sort<br>of stuff so how do you do something that<br>is actually<br>you know engaging and so what we did is<br>we took these kids away on all this<br>outdoor wilderness program we<br>and we've and i'll talk about the levels<br>and we factored all these levels in and<br>we did these amazing experiential<br>activities with these kids<br>and they just hadn't done these things<br>they had a whole other anti-social<br>behavior as well<br>so we took them on 10-day programs maybe<br>three leaders four leaders<br>you know these kids you know 12 kids<br>sometimes you can imagine what it was<br>like it was not<br>plain sailing it wasn't therapy in a<br>room<br>you know one-on-one where everything's<br>nice and white everything's pleasant or<br>everything's pink<br>it was something real and so what we do<br>is really challenge them<br>we really challenge them physically<br>sometimes we challenge the leaders so<br>that<br>some of the leaders actually broke down<br>and cried because it was so physically<br>difficult<br>you know and some of them really went<br>for me because i said you know let's<br>just carry on carry on carry on<br>12-hour days going going going but<br>actually there was a whole lot of afi<br>and aaha around that as well<br>because we really cared and nurtured<br>about these kids because they came from<br>and it was very very unique it was<br>incredibly world leading<br>you know and les simmons and chanel<br>hulian started it and i started<br>i picked it up the year after and came<br>on to that and did that for 10 years and<br>saw<br>hundreds of kids and family-based<br>therapy and we took it all around the<br>world<br>we had amazing things to and to going to<br>america looking at progress and really<br>seeing that actually we were really<br>world leading<br>because basically most people actually<br>incarcerated these people overseas in<br>america<br>they put them in boxes they can find<br>them and they took them away from their<br>families and we said that actually no<br>family is really important in terms of<br>healing and getting over this and<br>so there was no osh no cell phones<br>no gps nothing at all and we used to<br>sleep out and do these things and it was<br>based around these levels these are<br>american levels and if you notice<br>these it talks about iii<br>and what we did is we adapted the levels<br>to<br>be far more far now far now focused<br>and that's us sleeping out under the<br>stars we just sleep that under the stars<br>that's realized sometimes it would rain<br>and we'd run into a few problems<br>other times we wouldn't but it was kind<br>it focuses on them and the negative<br>stuff of not of not cooperating<br>having to explain a deal with my victim<br>as my perpetrator talk about that stuff<br>as well<br>and it also focuses on just them so it's<br>very very american and we really adapted<br>these<br>and we did some prettier special stuff<br>ruapehu tarawera canoeing rafting<br>learning how to make macaroni cheese<br>which is just boiling cheese and<br>chopping up cheese and just chucking it<br>but you know it wasn't easy work either<br>wasn't everyone's cup of tea<br>it was psychology in the real world and<br>it really took people<br>you know absolutely i was stressed at<br>times absolutely the kids were<br>but it was a fascinating thing 10 years<br>of doing that<br>yeah 10 years of doing that but i also<br>did some student research as well in<br>part of that<br>and what we found is four things that<br>that they had enhanced relationships<br>that they<br>felt more confidence that seeing oneself<br>was a part of the group and not actually<br>being so alone<br>and it really wasn't so much about what<br>happens but the intensity of it<br>and that that helped them disclose and<br>talk about what they had actually done<br>so it changed their view of self the<br>intensity of the experience<br>and really made a difference to them and<br>as one young person said<br>i wouldn't be as determined to do the<br>work or be as positive<br>if i hadn't been on the camp<br>and as i talked about we revise the<br>levels to learn more<br>demonstrate more appropriate ways of<br>relating to people<br>develop a plan to deal with my family<br>different to talk about ways of keeping<br>myself safe<br>and to apologize so they're very more<br>they see the focus is more on the family<br>and less on what they as individuals are<br>and i also learned a few things about<br>the kids that i didn't realize and<br>actually about some of the leaders as<br>well<br>i learned something about the new<br>zealand police that actually they have a<br>horse squad<br>and so i have these great sort of antics<br>ideas you see<br>that we'll go out and go up the guadale<br>falls and the kaimais and we'll do this<br>loop and we'll be fine<br>the thing about it is you'll if you're<br>going down a hill and it gets<br>steeper what it does as part of it turns<br>into cliff and stanley<br>one of our leaders actually dissicated<br>his shoulder so we had to turn around<br>and go back<br>and sometimes my geographical skills<br>weren't as good as they could be<br>so we actually got lost you know and<br>it's really really<br>experienced the young people the kids<br>cope with that incredibly well<br>stanley remarkably coped with it<br>incredibly well and he just<br>had a dislocated shoulder the female<br>staff did but one of their male staff<br>absolutely went ballistic<br>at me when he got back to safe he just<br>couldn't cope because he was so stressed<br>but you know i think there's real<br>learning in that the kids came out of<br>that and their kids<br>had a really positive experience you<br>know and i still kept my job which<br>and in fact the manager is here<br>and it's funny that i was emailing today<br>the guy that went ballistic at me when<br>we got back to safe and couldn't cope<br>because he was so stressed out<br>but he wasn't the guy that actually<br>dislocated his shoulder and all the<br>young people that were stressed out a<br>lot<br>um lost in the middle of the night yeah<br>we slept out we we were a bit cold but<br>we were fine<br>and i did learn that new zealand police<br>actually from hamilton sent the whole<br>police that<br>helped the horse squad out to go up the<br>track and look for us but they didn't<br>so then along the way i ended up doing a<br>phd and why some<br>men who are victims of abuse they go on<br>to abuse others and he ended up<br>um with split jobs firstly with white a<br>matter health working in the um<br>it was again about children and families<br>working in child and adolescent mental<br>health services<br>and then at the weary center because i<br>thought you know that<br>and having split jobs there was sally<br>mary's associate director i did those<br>but you never been in a split job it's<br>kind of hard to sort of your feelings<br>are you one place and they're not in<br>another place so<br>i was still doing research and frontline<br>delivery of the coalface many of us<br>other staff members didn't really know i<br>still went on a few wilderness programs<br>as well<br>but actually i really threw up the idea<br>that you know me do straight a students<br>make the best clinicians do they make<br>the best clinical psychologists<br>and i really wanted to inspire indeed<br>inspired students to work with young<br>people in youth justice from pacific and<br>maori<br>and non-western world views and not<br>actually diagnosing<br>children and one christmas we had this<br>sort of um<br>oh we had this sort of exercise where<br>people had to give from the clinical<br>staff<br>uh we went to fiona's house and we had<br>to sort of give something to this to the<br>other staff member that was symbolic of<br>them and<br>and they gave me this weirs wally thing<br>because you know i'm never in my office<br>you see in the we as well<br>they have no idea where i am and<br>that's kind of me because you know i<br>didn't think that you solved life<br>problems and the problems of anterior<br>in the universe by sitting in an office<br>and so i was never there and still are<br>and i just collected my mail which was<br>not a bad thing<br>but then i wanted a change and when i<br>was on the list adolescent program and i<br>actually realized today that i thought<br>what's an area that no one's doing any<br>work in<br>and i wrote one psychological report and<br>chuck some research in<br>and a man called ray coleman who this is<br>him in this picture<br>who is over there and my acknowledgement<br>to ray<br>um read this read this report and he<br>wrote<br>wrote back to me and he called me and he<br>said i do want to meet up and i said oh<br>yeah i meet up and<br>so we just shot the breeze and he was<br>really open and so i did 20 years of<br>practice in this area and visiting a<br>whole lot of amazing programs around the<br>world from the fbi in quantum virginia<br>when we were lost and we heard<br>the shooting we realized we were in the<br>right place<br>to staying in multiple fire fire<br>services<br>and actually going down the wrong way of<br>an la freeway<br>in a fire truck going to a 911 emergency<br>so it was pretty exciting pretty<br>interesting<br>we thought well okay what about new<br>zealand research what actually are we<br>going to do here<br>what do we do here what is going on here<br>and what happens to kids after these who<br>set fires 10 years after leaving an<br>intervention program that the fire<br>awareness and intervention program run<br>the new zealand fire service run<br>now this program isn't for young people<br>who are arsonists<br>it's very very rare but they might say<br>one to two to three fires<br>you know people like you who set fires<br>you don't talk about it as a youngster<br>or your relatives whatever and<br>these kids they're not bad kids but this<br>is what happens to them and we did this<br>study and it was a pretty<br>world-reading study we followed up these<br>kids for 10 years using police records<br>fire service data child youth and family<br>and what we found is that these kids<br>bring significant issues with them<br>prior to the fire setting largely their<br>boys<br>the majority they have multiple conduct<br>problem behaviors<br>many of them have psychosocial and<br>half of them have care and protection<br>histories under<br>odanga tamariki for abuse and neglect<br>many trauma histories<br>current mental health diagnosis suicide<br>cell and suicidal aviation self-harm and<br>school standouts and suspensions<br>but anyone knows anything about data and<br>this thing knows that actually that's an<br>so what we found that actually that<br>these kids also and these are police<br>rescue<br>record data the police code data<br>offending data according to these codes<br>severe moderate minor none<br>over half of them went on to offend<br>really serious and we're talking and<br>we're talking about<br>severe offending we're talking about<br>murder manslaughter<br>arson rape the most serious offending<br>that would happen in new zealand<br>and the moderate stuff you know things<br>like knife robbery<br>those sort of stuff as well absolutely<br>driving charges<br>very very few of them go on to commit<br>arson only about four percent of them do<br>but many of them end up in the justice<br>system<br>so the conclusion is really when these<br>kids turn up<br>at a fire awareness event an invention<br>program<br>many of them come with a whole history<br>but they also go on to really really<br>negative life outcomes<br>you know but i thought this is all very<br>good you know it's all very good for a<br>bunch of<br>people to run an outdoor wilderness<br>based therapy program do research around<br>that for young people with harmful<br>sexual behaviors<br>for over 10 years to do a study around<br>the fire awareness and venture<br>intervention program and to actually<br>identify to child youth and family that<br>but actually why do these things stop<br>and why do things not actually go on and<br>carry on<br>and i really thought that actually it's<br>well and good but i needed to move my<br>focus into something broader and bigger<br>i needed to take on<br>something at a more broader level for<br>new zealand<br>so i started at this level i looked at<br>the criminalization of young people<br>and there was a summer student charlotte<br>and my colleague julia and we thought<br>you know we really<br>you know people talk about new zealand<br>having a world justice<br>world leading youth justice thing a<br>service<br>really actually you think about it the<br>age of criminal responsibility<br>we're criminalizing young people what do<br>so he wrote this article that focused on<br>17 year olds in the in<br>in the youth justice system in the new<br>and we said that actually we needed to<br>raise the age we needed to stop<br>criminalizing these young people we<br>needed to make a difference<br>for their lives their lives their life<br>outcomes<br>but you know i realized and acknowledged<br>i made it a serious admission<br>so i did a presentation the children's<br>commissioner's office on this study<br>and i committed heresy and burnt a hole<br>in the um<br>in the title of the journal and that was<br>my first slide to this audience<br>ministry people children's commissioner<br>etc<br>and i said actually it's actually i got<br>it wrong i admitted i got it wrong<br>and i said actually if we're being<br>really honest about it we needed to<br>focus i needed to change the title to<br>the white or the matter<br>putting the needs of maori rangatahi<br>first and we needed to actually say that<br>actually over 80<br>of the young people in the youth justice<br>system are maori so if we're being<br>really honest about it we need to put<br>that really up front<br>and i think some of my colleagues<br>across ministries were somewhat taken<br>back<br>by how direct and honest i was about<br>that<br>because it is actually about an<br>opportunity of a lifetime taking a<br>holistic lens<br>of young people family community te a<br>maori perspective<br>developmental perspective to the issue<br>the impact of criminal convictions on<br>employment<br>and life outcomes and i'm really pleased<br>to say that the age did get raised<br>and it probably could go further<br>so that was me starting off on my career<br>of taking a broader perspective<br>on things and taking a wider perspective<br>and then one day i was minding my own<br>business and i got a phone call at a<br>conference<br>i was teaching supervising researching<br>doing a few<br>clinical work few psych reports bits of<br>advisory thing but i wasn't looking for<br>another job<br>and someone ran me up and said oh look<br>you know<br>there's this job as chief science<br>adviser of the justice sector i said<br>what<br>they said oh we had reapplied and we<br>didn't really get the people that we<br>suited would you be willing and looking<br>at it and i said oh you sent it through<br>and i did i applied for this job and got<br>this job at chief<br>science advisor justice sector and<br>really it's about promoting<br>public understanding of engaging with<br>robust evidence<br>and for you meth cooks in the<br>audience and there are a few of you i<br>know there are at least two of you i<br>know<br>but then actually it's also been framed<br>as actually where thai kick is on<br>government<br>you know there's a whole lot of stuff<br>that policy people can't say<br>because they would lose their jobs<br>they'll be silenced so you can't do that<br>sort of stuff<br>so one of my tasks is actually to rattle<br>the cage in a very diplomatic way buying<br>coffees as much as i can<br>but also saying things that you couldn't<br>and i really wanted to focus on the gaps<br>the gaps in the justice system<br>and proving it for the lives of young<br>people in their whanau<br>and i wanted to focus on justice system<br>transformation<br>and really it's well well recognized<br>that incarceration rates<br>are independent of crime rates and it's<br>government policy that<br>guides who goes to prison and for how<br>long<br>you know in a few years ago you might<br>remember there was a certain numb group<br>political party that was talking about<br>the 3 000 mega person at waikeria<br>you know the trouble with the person<br>that the scoping of that exercise is<br>they hadn't done maths at primary school<br>because actually if you're really being<br>honest about it you'd have to multiply<br>that by three to four to two to six<br>because not my crimes still my sentence<br>what is the impact on a child when a<br>parent goes to prison<br>so it's not the three thousand<br>absolutely it's not<br>you have to think about the kids that<br>are impacted we knew it sounds a great<br>idea one stop shop<br>chop them put them all together but it's<br>false economy absolutely false economy<br>on any given monday<br>more than 23 000 children are affected<br>by having<br>a parent in prison in new zealand<br>and how in a country this small can we<br>get it so<br>there are some people in this room that<br>pay too much tax<br>some try to avoid it and you know<br>there's the odd one the very odd one<br>that actually pays no tax<br>and if you look at this graph on what we<br>spend on and this is<br>data from new zealand what we spend on<br>education<br>health and law and order<br>your cg is that how my taxes are being<br>spent<br>and that absolutely is how your taxes<br>are if you pay it<br>so really what can we do about that<br>when we've got a look at the elephant in<br>the room the elephant in the room is<br>that actually early intervention across<br>health education justice child<br>wellbeing everything we do it incredibly<br>poorly in new zealand<br>most countries do but we do it<br>particularly poorly in new zealand<br>and you know really we need to start<br>reframing and turning upside down what<br>how we view people that go into the<br>justice system<br>so instead of asking what's wrong with<br>you we need to be asking<br>what happened to you how did it affect<br>you what sense did you make of it<br>and what did you have to do to survive<br>because all of us are<br>the same as this the deepest scars are<br>those that we cannot see<br>for youth offenders out on the fenders<br>but for me as well and all you as well<br>absolutely<br>we all come with a history<br>so how come we can't turn this on on<br>upside down and reframe it<br>and including for kids asking what's<br>rather than stop asking what's wrong<br>with this child start<br>asking what happened to this kid what<br>happened to this child<br>and really what do we what do they need<br>what do they need in order to help them<br>so remember what this talk is about it's<br>about making connections<br>children and families far now and<br>wanting to make a difference<br>and you know i'm a very strategic<br>operator<br>and so these two people will probably<br>only be known to about one if<br>possibly one or two of you this is the<br>chief justice helen with hellman<br>and that is hemi taumanu the chief<br>district court judge<br>and i know them very well and they are<br>and i deliberately wrote some papers<br>along with my friend and colleague<br>olivia hyland up there<br>and we've two papers one of them when i<br>was summoned again to the district court<br>by him we have an urgent meeting in i<br>want to three of the heads hemi<br>tamana was there the head of the youth<br>court was there and the head of the<br>family caught there was<br>tuesday morning as i had to go and see<br>them and they wanted to talk to me about<br>some justice reform i cannot talk about<br>that<br>but you know i had targets of these<br>journals and these journals are not the<br>lancet they're not<br>nature they have a minus impact factor<br>and i'm really proud of that that i<br>targeted these journals to write papers<br>and because i knew<br>and on tuesday he reminded me of the<br>title of the of the paper the<br>opportunity of a lifetime<br>so did just just the chief justice two<br>weeks ago<br>when i met with her in the supreme court<br>in wellington<br>so i thought it's actually working i'm<br>starting to nudge<br>you know nudge and nudge you know and i<br>i was um come out with some titles of a<br>of another journal i wanted to put in<br>the law journal i never got a response<br>from a um<br>a student of mine called jerome and i<br>said well jerome you haven't got a job<br>so you're not going to lose it<br>if you haven't got one and i i've got a<br>job and i don't care if i lose it<br>so you know because the title this paper<br>was going to be on the forgotten<br>children<br>and i'll talk about that more later the<br>children that have forgotten the youth<br>group<br>and sure that would really rattle some<br>people who are other forgotten children<br>how do you write something about in a<br>law journal absolutely<br>they'll take notice of it i know they<br>will<br>so one of the roles as a science advisor<br>i didn't want to be when i finished my<br>term to be a guy that kind of like you<br>know<br>has gone to a lot of meetings set a lot<br>of chairs there's dust on<br>seats and it feels good you know i<br>wanted to really nudge for change<br>and i wanted to really push the envelope<br>and really do things so what i did is i<br>wrote four reports<br>the first is and i'll talk about these<br>using evidence to build a better justice<br>system it's never too early never too<br>late<br>every four minutes and what were they<br>thinking and i'll talk briefly about<br>you know the first one successive<br>governments have focused on<br>retribution of those in the justice<br>system<br>and we focus on as opposed to the data<br>we're looking at dogma<br>a political dogma of what sounds good<br>and not looking at evidence-based<br>interventions<br>and you know what i did is i said it<br>actually also in this<br>in the paper that actually prisons are<br>and one of the ces who's not the ceo<br>that current ministry now<br>came up to me and said how dare you say<br>that how do you think it makes feel i<br>said<br>you know anyone on the street would know<br>that actually that's true and that's<br>reality<br>you don't have to be a rocket scientist<br>to work that out so that really pushed<br>and you know my area is youth justice<br>and so what i did is i wrote a paper<br>called never too early never too late a<br>discussion paper on preventing youth<br>offending<br>but you know what i found is actually<br>that there was a really good report<br>called turning the tide<br>20 years ago it was written by the<br>ministry of justice across the justice i<br>think it was primarily<br>primarily in the department of<br>corrections it was a very good report<br>for its time you know what<br>none of the recommendations have<br>followed up at all and you know that's<br>an inherent problem because it misses a<br>whole cohort of kids<br>and those are all maori kids primarily<br>maori kids so really what are we doing<br>and how come these reports get the dust<br>dust dust dust<br>and we failed to actually look and be<br>honest about the issue at hand<br>and you know there was a current another<br>ministry that said i heard you<br>you sort of said that you know you were<br>a bit offended that i hadn't uh we<br>hadn't looked at it of course we are<br>i won't name the ministry and i said i<br>said oh yeah no that's fine i know you<br>are you know what of course they are<br>aren't no one's ever come from the<br>ministry that should<br>to say what can i learn from your report<br>how can we help that how can we<br>implement that into practice<br>and then i thought you know that<br>actually a lot of this comes back to two<br>issues<br>family violence and drugs and alcohol<br>you know in every four minutes the cops<br>get<br>called out in new zealand to a family<br>and it was a discussion paper on this<br>and you know in new zealand we don't<br>have<br>any we still don't any evidence-based<br>prevention<br>around family violence at all nothing at<br>all<br>and actually a lot of what i cited came<br>from from the dissenter<br>center for disease control so how come<br>in a country like ours we can't do that<br>and the most cost effective way of<br>dealing with this is actually to look at<br>early interventions<br>and then i wrote a paper about what were<br>they thinking a discussion paper and<br>brain and behaviour<br>you know a 39 year old has been prison<br>first head injury at two<br>first in prison at 16 caraxin 36 no<br>medical<br>treatment feels his<br>headaches dizziness balance problems<br>fatigue and because all these things he<br>loses the job<br>and he feels depressed in trouble and<br>you know the justice system is way over<br>represented with people with<br>traumatic brain injury from being hit<br>fetal alcohol<br>so i kind of think really<br>how can we take a more preventative<br>model what do we really need to do<br>what do we need to do as a country how<br>can we really shift things and change<br>things<br>and you know the longer a child is with<br>goes without help the harder is to reach<br>the word in here was autism<br>but i got a friend of mine marlon son<br>ian to take it out he's an i.t<br>guru you can put any childhood disorder<br>in there and that's fact<br>but if you put conduct problems in<br>conduct disorder<br>it is the most costly childhood disorder<br>there is<br>poor life outcomes cost the society<br>costs to<br>wherever victims their lives etc<br>and how can we prevent the car crash<br>that's happening despite<br>numerous calls really there's a lack of<br>apparent understanding about the prison<br>pipeline and actually where it actually<br>starts<br>so you know my spare time you know when<br>i'm not in my office and i'm being<br>i trained up two four social workers and<br>a supervisor<br>with the help of very good psychologist<br>anthony<br>and um we developed this program<br>um called mana tamariki with full and<br>profit funding from the tyndall<br>foundation vodafone and orangutan<br>marieke and we were really interested in<br>transforming<br>social work practice small case loads<br>working with children from 6 to 11.<br>really why can't we do something like<br>that you know because i'm not a bright<br>guy but how come no one's ever thought<br>of this before<br>you know it's extraordinary isn't it you<br>know you have a youth justice system but<br>really no one says<br>what about children who are offending<br>what can we do about these you know what<br>these kids are out of school 10 year old<br>can't even actually write his own name<br>can't even write his own name spell his<br>own name that is not from five years ago<br>that's from<br>this year eight years old out of the<br>school system really<br>so what we did is we did did this and<br>we've been trialling it it's a bit of a<br>it's a bit of a challenge nudging a<br>system like a rangatamariki<br>you know because one of the problems is<br>is that actually i'm not the manager and<br>not controlling it if i did i would move<br>some more pieces on the<br>thing but i think there are some real<br>real opportunities i think they're real<br>opportunities<br>for ewe and us partnering with ewe and<br>taking it out of a ministry and<br>partnering with ewe<br>but you know what we found actually is<br>the notifications and these are the<br>notifications of the kids on this<br>program<br>this is this year that actually nine out<br>of the twelve children on average had<br>eleven notifications to orangutan riki<br>before the age of 12.<br>all had notifications and these are<br>notifications of abuse neglect<br>trauma you don't have notifications if<br>something absolutely isn't going wrong<br>in your life<br>before the age of seven and an average<br>of the age of two<br>these are children in this city<br>so really what can we do that's<br>different<br>and you know what i said to the chief<br>justice i said there are 170 children<br>under<br>section 41e and that us<br>that are under the age of 14 and why<br>can't<br>why are prevention and intervention<br>efforts so seldom applied<br>how come that actually we can't take a<br>therapeutic lens more and be less<br>directive and less controlling<br>and be truly client focused and be<br>really really collaborative<br>how come we can't do that in ministries<br>you know and really if countries across<br>the globe are truly going to focus on<br>mass incarceration<br>and in prisons and look at the over<br>representation of indigenous<br>minority populations in prison then we<br>really need to look at what feeds it<br>currently conversations are stuck on<br>solving the problem outside the wire<br>and all the scientific evidence would<br>say<br>that these interventions absolutely<br>repeatedly fail<br>and they're merely like putting fingers<br>and certainly credit needs to go to<br>jerome<br>who i mentioned earlier but i won't<br>mention what part of the talk i<br>mentioned earlier<br>in reference to one part of my talk<br>so really thinking about it who is easy<br>to change<br>is it the politicians those people dress<br>well<br>nice cars flash lives big salaries or is<br>it the young people<br>who come they don't turn up and say look<br>i really wanted to start being a youth<br>offender this is what i wanted to sign<br>up when i was two years old<br>this is my job this is my career who<br>really is it who really is it easy to<br>wrangle and deal with<br>you know you might think okay well now<br>what am i going to do<br>what is this guy going to do next<br>you know i think we have to look at the<br>mental health and the justice system you<br>know what i got i showed some stats<br>and it wasn't stats that um it's stats<br>that actually are problematic if we<br>release them because they will kind of<br>throw<br>you'll be like this but really i'm kind<br>of in the process of you know are they<br>just plain bad a discussion paper and<br>mental health<br>and behavior in relation to the justice<br>system that<br>should be there next year and what it<br>will do is nudge a few<br>nudge a few ministries it will nudge a<br>few politicians<br>but you know the desired outcome will be<br>to actually hopefully improve the lives<br>of others<br>and the other thing is my friend andrew<br>b croft<br>we're going to do some things in<br>relation to the age of criminal<br>responsibility next year and i met with<br>them about a month ago and<br>we're having ongoing dialogue to<br>actually raise it from 10 to 12<br>and do some other things in the youth<br>justice system which i won't talk about<br>because they're encoded silent so we're<br>being recorded<br>but those are on my sites next year to<br>do<br>absolutely because it's very very<br>important to do that<br>so really in concluding<br>preventing youth offending and keeping<br>young people out of prison is very<br>simple<br>and yet very very complicated<br>day to day it's about not judging the<br>disruptive kid at school<br>just wanting to kick him out but it's<br>also about reflecting on our beliefs<br>about<br>relationships who's responsible her<br>family well-being in our communities and<br>how public and private resources<br>should be applied we need to take note<br>of implementation science start with the<br>needs of children families at the centre<br>and work out<br>how to meet them guided by evidence from<br>science to<br>maori and real world experience but you<br>know it's complicated to wrangle<br>politicians more than youth offenders<br>systems and services<br>who are currently measured by individual<br>outputs<br>to have to work together to meet those<br>needs and to ensure sustained leadership<br>get staff trained up supported to work<br>well across sectors<br>and diverse communities it's hard to<br>bring people along with you<br>even if you have a champion of change<br>and leading from the front<br>you know but talking about the<br>well-being of babies seems a long way<br>from arguments with politicians about<br>the prison muster<br>but that is where the evidence saves we<br>must<br>now i just want to thank the um the<br>current<br>and the past clinical staff cheryl for<br>um<br>managing all my sort of um<br>administration um challenges<br>suzanne purdy for sort of getting me up<br>here in the first place michelle burster<br>who probably isn't here<br>but man she saves me out of 310.<br>margaret francis who sorts out all my<br>computer issues<br>and balau and natalie who kind of like<br>saves us out of 310<br>and the science factory staff doug and<br>the dean and my current and past<br>students and obviously<br>some of them are actually law students<br>and gone on to be lawyers and i've given<br>them challenge that you can't actually<br>do anything to nudge your system unless<br>you're a judge<br>and that's actually quite true because<br>that's where the power arise but those<br>are my past<br>and presence and also you know i want to<br>thank you know the departmental science<br>advisor colleagues<br>you know julia gerard peter gluckman my<br>other colleagues amazing amazing people<br>and the people i've worked with across<br>the ministries<br>and the wellington bubble as i call it<br>there are some incredibly kind and<br>wonderful people there<br>and what they really do is they really<br>appreciate the fact that i say things<br>that they can't<br>and i can nudge things that they can't<br>and you know as ian thanks for my family<br>and friends those that are here and<br>those that aren't here<br>and you can't do this without them and<br>so my thank you to<br>you all and we should go back to where<br>we started<br>started as a rat bag as a kid that sat<br>at the back of the school got kicked out<br>of<br>class and we're being recorded so i've<br>only told you part of the story<br>but that's dunedin on a really rainy day<br>and oh next time i was there i'll take<br>it i'll take a summer's picture but<br>thank you very much for coming along<br>maybe when you think that when you're<br>thanking faculty of science staff you<br>might add to that maga spragan who has<br>the ability to<br>uh to put together the various bits of<br>your application for promotion in a way<br>that will be acceptable to the central<br>committee<br>indeed and then you might thank me for<br>ian hey um are you happy to take some<br>questions yeah i can take half of one<br>half a question<br>you'll have to yell because i listened<br>to a lot of music at the captain cook<br>hotel<br>also was amazing music but yeah just<br>interesting to know of the fingers that<br>you<br>you know come across and you work with<br>do you get the general sense that they<br>actually do want to get back on the<br>you know you have to realize that this<br>gig there on is not that actually happy<br>it's not a gig of sort of enjoying<br>people being down on them<br>you know ending up in police cells<br>ending up you know with a social worker<br>ending up with people on the back it's<br>not a gift that you and i would enjoy of<br>course they don't<br>and they want to make it they want to<br>have a different life but it's about<br>giving them the skills supporting with<br>the skills supporting<br>them and and empowering them to be<br>different<br>um you talked about um refraining from<br>diagnosing<br>can you speak a little bit about the<br>benefits and pros the pros and cons of<br>the guy receiving a diagnosis system<br>okay so i should the thing about it is<br>the only time i would think about this<br>and i tell my three or no students<br>is when it really relates to getting<br>resources that's the only time<br>but i said i'd never diagnose anyone in<br>my old life apart from myself<br>and i give myself multiple diagnosis<br>yeah so that's a<br>that's a good point but you know i think<br>kids get over diagnosed over medicated<br>and um you know also we're being<br>recorded but also<br>professionals like me you know get<br>really professional about themselves<br>and there's an incredibly problem about<br>that too and that doesn't help people<br>change<br>you know what i mean it doesn't it's not<br>if it was that simple it would be good<br>must be us um one for me um and<br>would you say though that diagnosing<br>early head injury i noticed you had that<br>as a<br>slide there could be a thing that's<br>worth doing<br>yeah i do think so i think the issue i<br>was pushing with head injuries early<br>intervention is absolutely key<br>absolutely key on all these things and<br>it doesn't happen early enough and we<br>need to do more<br>um but i think we're at the wrong end<br>we fund the wrong end and the graph<br>tells us everything about what we do at<br>the wrong end<br>and um you know i need to talk to<br>um jacinda about that and<br>educate her this year and i will<br>thank you very much fantastic<br>presentation<br>when you're talking about intervention<br>at a very early age<br>what do you have in mind what are your<br>thoughts what are your ideas around that<br>if you send me an email i'll send you<br>i'll send you a paper<br>but i think it's clearly going to be you<br>know<br>pre-birth but it's got to be in the<br>early as early as you can<br>and i think what you you know there are<br>you know i think we you know there are<br>evidence-based interventions that need<br>to be adapted for the cultural context<br>of new zealand that can be applied and<br>there are organizations that have<br>actually done that well<br>and i think that and it's interesting i<br>think that things like nurse family<br>partnership<br>you know there's a whole lot of<br>longitudinal 20 plus years of research<br>in that<br>i'm not saying important like an<br>american sort of mcdonald's but i'm<br>saying<br>you need to actually if we culturally<br>adapted that and actually measured it we<br>don't measure things<br>you know orangutan doesn't measure<br>outcomes would you give<br>a child who with diabetes oh let's just<br>give them that drug or that drug<br>of course you wouldn't you have to<br>measure that and how come in a system<br>the science advisor are pretty new in<br>this system isn't it and<br>i just find it like you're kind of<br>inside the system and outside the system<br>that's the implementation i mean what<br>what how do you<br>how do you think it's going to go and<br>evolve and i think there'll be<br>ultimately maori science advisors across<br>all ministry and that should happen<br>absolutely that should happen there's no<br>doubt about that<br>i think what you have to be is you have<br>to be incredibly<br>diplomatic polite and got reasonable<br>social skills i thought none of those<br>threes are gone<br>and you know i just think you've got to<br>be good at buying lots of problems and<br>just be kind to people and realizing how<br>far you can nudge but sometimes<br>you know sometimes draw a line in the<br>sand you know what i mean<br>but you you know it's about<br>relationships and connections and it's<br>about<br>realizing that you know banging the<br>department of corrections is not helpful<br>you know why<br>because they're at the long end of the<br>abuse and the intergenerational abuse<br>they do their best surely they should<br>improve them but all organizations can<br>this one can as well you know so<br>you know and it's about working with<br>people in a constructive way and<br>thinking about motivation living where<br>you come from<br>you know where do people change they<br>change by being
