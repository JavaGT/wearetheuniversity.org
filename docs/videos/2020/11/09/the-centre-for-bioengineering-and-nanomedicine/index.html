It also gives postgraduate students and industry the opportunity to conduct bioengineering and nanomedicine research with world-class scientists. The Centre brings together the University of Otago’s strengths in biomaterials, biological and medical health research that translates basic science to applied sciences and engineering in order to improve health outcomes. We have researchers and clinicians based in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington campuses working closely with other tertiary institutions, District Health Boards, and industry.<br><br><br>Visit the Centre for Bioengineering and Nanomedicine website - https://www.otago.ac.nz/bioengineering/</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i love having some sort of health<br>related or medical problem<br>and designing something in the<br>laboratory and applying it<br>for some biological characterization or<br>in vitro and vivo outcome<br>and seeing an immediate impact of things<br>that i design<br>in the lab affecting a biological<br>process<br>bioengineering allows you to be at the<br>forefront of innovative life-changing<br>devices you get to develop them<br>emerges biology and engineering and<br>allows you to cover a wide range of<br>subject areas and specialties to solve<br>health related problems<br>so those are the whole series of even<br>the activities<br>directly contribute to to improve the<br>quality of life<br>and as a result this is a very exciting<br>area and<br>yes we are passionate about that and you<br>can see that our students are<br>very very excited about their project so<br>i work mainly in product design<br>and additive added manufacturing in the<br>prosthetic area<br>and using the knowledge of the other<br>students around me to help create<br>amazing and exciting ideas<br>i incorporated an anti-inflammatory drug<br>with polymers to produce<br>a surgical suture so i use several<br>additive manufacturing methods<br>which includes 3d printing or mental<br>shell riding or biomaterial development<br>in order to create artificial<br>intervertebral disc<br>we have quite a sophisticated vent and<br>good range of<br>equipment so career options include<br>going into the manufacturing sector like<br>pharmaceuticals biotech industry<br>academia other research institutes<br>government regulatory agencies hospitals<br>things like that i chose otago because<br>the facilities were there ready to be<br>used the staff were very supportive<br>and they were really excited about the<br>ideas that i came with<br>and really want to help me succeed in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
