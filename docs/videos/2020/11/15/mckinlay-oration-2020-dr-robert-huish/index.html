But what if you can’t? These simple guidelines are difficult or impossible for many members of our global society, either because of their roles as essential service workers, or due to exceptional personal circumstances, or simple from a lack of means. Added to this are a wide range of racialized and nationalist stereotypes about “certain people” spreading of COVID-19. This has fuelled prejudice, divided families, led to violence, and ground many economies to a halt. The global community’s pre-vaccine response to COVID-19 has relied on centuries-old public health methods of isolation, embargo and quarantine. These ancient front-line tactics come with ancient problems, notably stigma. Stigma is a public health risk unto itself, and a global health risk more broadly.<br><br>In this talk, Dr Robert Huish shares research findings from his current project “The consequences and outcomes of cultural stigma from COVID-19 ordinances”. By identifying which public health orders, and social response fuel stigma, and which ones mitigate it, Dr Huish argues that pandemic planning needs to go beyond “flattening the curve” or “containing the virus”. His work points to examples of public health policies that work to actually “take care of people, rather than fight the virus” during this, and future pandemics.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

of geography and i've been a<br>member of the<br>um the leadership group of the oghi<br>ever since it started i'm sure phillip<br>will remind me how long ago it was i<br>think it was probably<br>six or seven years ago but it's been<br>very successful<br>and every year we have this conference<br>round about this time<br>and one of the high spots of this<br>conference<br>is the mckinley oration<br>um this we always have this um during<br>the conference<br>um the mckinley aeration is named after<br>the<br>mckinley family who very generously<br>endowed a chair here at the university<br>a chair in the center for international<br>health<br>which is presently held by professor<br>john crump<br>john is currently on research leave<br>i believe in the u.s coping with<br>whether or not there's been a success in<br>the election and all the rest of it but<br>we're very grateful genuinely we're very<br>grateful<br>to the mckinley family for um endowing<br>this<br>chair in the in our center for<br>international health<br>uh our speaker tonight in the mckinley<br>oration<br>is um professor robert huish<br>bob huish um he's based<br>at dalhousie university which is in the<br>far east of canada uh in halifax in nova<br>scotia and<br>i actually know bob bob very well um<br>he's been over here several times but<br>sadly<br>he's stranded over there at the moment<br>but he's very keen<br>to talk to us tonight um<br>bob has uh he's um a professor in the<br>international development studies at<br>dalhousie<br>and like me he comes from a sort of<br>geography development studies background<br>focus focusing particularly on<br>developing countries in his case<br>he's focused a lot on cuba his phd was<br>on cuba<br>he wrote a book on cuba's health system<br>and he's done work recently on cuban<br>medical internationalism uh the broader<br>field of interest<br>is health and development um<br>he's written a number of papers on<br>international health electives<br>and issues of global citizenship<br>he's done some fascinating work also on<br>north korea<br>when he was here a couple of years ago<br>he was really into his work on north<br>korea<br>and i must say it was absolutely<br>fascinating talking to him about that<br>and another interest of his is sport and<br>development<br>sport and development most recently<br>um he's done some quite innovative<br>things<br>he's set up a thing called the global<br>development<br>primer which is a series of podcasts and<br>uh a number of us across the world have<br>uh recorded these podcasts for<br>bob and apparently they're very heavily<br>used by students in<br>in canada particularly but i think also<br>also<br>wider a field and then<br>in uh you know with with the covid um<br>pandemic that we're all faced with at<br>the moment<br>he's launched a course called pandemic<br>the class<br>um which is again is proving to be<br>incredibly popular<br>um it's all about um uh it's an online<br>course<br>on managing pandemics through<br>cooperation<br>and collaboration and his latest<br>research<br>which we're going to hear about tonight<br>is focusing<br>on the issue of stigma stigma associated<br>with<br>um with the covid pandemic but he's<br>doing some very interesting work in<br>nova scotia um looking for example how<br>asians in the nova scotian society are<br>facing<br>stigma associated with this with the<br>with this<br>covid so i think we're in for a really<br>interesting lecture tonight um it's<br>focusing largely on understanding the<br>consequences of stigma<br>from covid19 so there he is<br>hello bob come on in right hello dunedin<br>always a pleasure welcome to otago<br>university<br>i'm gonna hand over to you bob great<br>thank you very much tony for a uh<br>fantastic introduction and thank you<br>everybody for<br>uh tuning in uh to to this this evening<br>or<br>very early morning as it is here in nova<br>scotia<br>it would be absolutely wonderful<br>to to be back in otago to to join you<br>but as you know the pandemic has made<br>things<br>uh challenging so tonight<br>if you um if you allow me i will take<br>you through some what tony said<br>about research issues on stigma<br>so let me just see here can everyone see<br>the<br>screen just a just a quick hands up<br>you're all good<br>okay awesome great and this will be the<br>the 2020 mckinley oration for the<br>otago global health institute 13th<br>annual 13th annual conference now<br>uh jackie may have been following some<br>of you around with these<br>little qr codes and if you've got the<br>time and if you've got your phone<br>uh just take a shot or open up your<br>camera device<br>and take a shot of this qr code it will<br>take you to a survey<br>that if you're able to to do while i'm<br>i'm speaking to you we can engage with<br>some of the results in a little bit<br>if you don't have a phone with a with a<br>qr code reading camera<br>just head to mentee.com and the code<br>there is 280406n1<br>and if you need some help with that<br>jackie can<br>can can help you out there i'll leave<br>the code up here you can even aim your<br>phone at the screen<br>and it should take you to the survey so<br>as<br>tony said uh this evening i would like<br>to talk about<br>stigma and that related to the coven 19<br>pandemic this is the elephant that is in<br>all of our rooms around the world<br>and it raises questions about how we as<br>a global society are experiencing this<br>this totally universal phenomena<br>and how we're experiencing in profoundly<br>different ways<br>so some people are referring very well<br>some people have the means and resources<br>to get through this<br>others less so and others have been<br>targeted<br>by the measures that we put in place to<br>try to abate the virus so these are the<br>things i want to get to<br>but as i say everyone is experiencing<br>this in completely different ways and<br>the one individual<br>the one individual on the planet who's<br>experienced the covet 19 pandemic and<br>probably<br>the most profoundly different way<br>ever would be the 45th president of the<br>united states<br>donald trump whose lucid prophecy on<br>covet 19 reminds us of the following<br>things that it's<br>as he said it affects virtually nobody<br>as he said it's an amazing thing<br>uh i see the disinfectant where it<br>knocks it out in a minute is there a way<br>we can do something<br>by giving people an injection uh he<br>doesn't like wearing masks<br>in case there's an event where he has to<br>meet a dictator in the overall office<br>and when he actually had covet himself<br>he said that a total and complete<br>sign-off from the white house doctors<br>that means that i can't get covered 19<br>and that he's immune to it and uh<br>you know very very nice to know as<br>donald trump<br>says twitter flagged that as<br>as being misleading information and<br>today<br>the united states hit a new milestone<br>with over<br>10 million cases of covet 19<br>in that one country which is one-fifth<br>of all the cover 19 cases on the planet<br>during the during the rallies that took<br>place<br>when in you know during the presidential<br>campaign<br>we see a very different very very<br>different phenomena<br>about how these two leaders these two<br>candidates<br>worked together during this during this<br>time<br>in terms of raising votes you had donald<br>trump whose<br>tendency to have mass rallies shoulder<br>to shoulder<br>had nothing to do with social distancing<br>while joe biden<br>had drive-in rallies and encouraged mask<br>wearing and this sort of<br>this sort of thing uh so one absolutely<br>shunned the public health measures at<br>every turn<br>to which he himself contracted the virus<br>and the other in 2020 there was<br>there's more cases of copenhagen<br>actually<br>in the white house in october of 2020<br>than there were in<br>all of new zealand and even new<br>zealand's uptick of<br>25 new cases still was dwarfed<br>by the white house's 36 new<br>so make sure that you're you're you're<br>getting my screen here<br>um<br>so we've got two very very different<br>characters uh<br>who ran in the u.s presidential election<br>and now that mr biden has been elected<br>president-elect we should expect a very<br>different approach to pandemic in the<br>u.s<br>from at least the top office but mind<br>you it's a very low bar to jump<br>from what was presented in over the last<br>year from donald trump<br>nature a scientific magazine rarely<br>chimes in on politics<br>but in this case they actually have a<br>recent article out that shows<br>the four ways in which donald trump<br>himself<br>has uh rolled back the<br>the ability to deal with the virus in<br>the united states<br>and so this is the scientists coming in<br>and saying that by trump's leadership<br>in the white house it actually caused<br>catastrophic results for the american<br>population<br>by attempting to silence scientists by<br>ignoring advice<br>especially related to social distancing<br>mask wearing and cruise ships<br>to delay public health reports coming<br>out and<br>attempting to prematurely authorize<br>cures that had not been scientifically<br>tested<br>so that's the scientific critique<br>against trump's leadership<br>i'm very concerned with the social<br>science critique of trump's leadership<br>here and<br>by extension how other leaders in the<br>world have dealt with coca 19 pandemic<br>as for social science mr trump when he<br>took to the podium spread hatred<br>and misinformation with impunity and now<br>with the bad apple out of the bunch<br>hopefully we can<br>you know rest assured but what's going<br>to be the lingering result of this<br>i mean mr trump even when he was at the<br>podium right even though his aides had<br>put in<br>his speaking notes as you can see here<br>to use the word coronavirus<br>he himself took a sharpie across it and<br>wrote in the word<br>chinese from the highest office in the<br>united states<br>there was stigmatization right away<br>but again now mr biden is not of the<br>same sort of character<br>and now the united states will enter<br>into an arab global leadership<br>where other leaders have taken the coven<br>19 pandemic<br>seriously but there still stands a risk<br>there still stands a risk<br>that is always about investing too much<br>in the characters<br>of our of our leaders and rather than<br>the consistent work that's necessary at<br>a community level<br>to make sure that society itself is<br>embracing kindness<br>now here in canada there's been many<br>cases about<br>uh we've seen kindness fall far too<br>short especially when it<br>comes to the impact on asian canadians<br>or<br>persons who appear to be evasion descent<br>this story here that<br>vancouver one was punched for sneezing<br>it was a latest<br>racist attack in the city of vancouver<br>there's other cases that i'll get to but<br>it is a global phenomena including that<br>of new zealand<br>where there's been dozens of complaints<br>to the human rights commission about<br>covenanting racism<br>during the during the pandemic and<br>mostly targeted<br>at asian kiwis and of course<br>in the united states and with the the<br>advent of cell phones we're able to<br>to witness events like this where<br>we see this individual here<br>who was sprayed with febreze on the new<br>york<br>subway system to which the police uh<br>later launched an investigation<br>but uh this this is a one account<br>against<br>asian americans with regards to the<br>covet 19 pandemic<br>now extending this while in the early<br>parts of the pandemic<br>the stigmatization towards persons who<br>appear to be of asian descent<br>was quite predominant there's been other<br>forms of stigmatization that have also<br>fallen out that are quite interesting<br>so in canada where we have a closed<br>border with the united states<br>just to put this in perspective this is<br>the longest undefended border on the<br>planet<br>and it's closed this has never happened<br>before<br>but as a result of knowing that there's<br>been<br>a lot of uptick of covet 19 cases in the<br>united states<br>we've seen various attacks here on this<br>side of the border such as this<br>individual<br>vancouver island who drove his truck to<br>canada with texas license plates and<br>woke up to find his<br>his truck graffitied now here where i am<br>in nova scotia which tends to pride<br>itself on being a very friendly place<br>for<br>anyone to visit and enjoy we've seen<br>similar cases<br>such as this case here where we've got<br>this um<br>it's a honda i don't know what kind of<br>honda it is but<br>upon this honda it was there was a<br>litter that said you know go home<br>now this honda belonged to benjamin hebb<br>now there's there's ben right there<br>and ben as you can see proud canadian<br>proud nova scotian and a proud<br>ghostbusters fan<br>he likes ghostbusters the movies which<br>is why he put on the front<br>of his plate ecto-1 it was a it was a<br>gag license plate that he put on the<br>front<br>of his car and people started to target<br>his car to say go back to<br>to new york so we're seeing this in a<br>kind of bizarre way<br>in canada but we're also seeing it in a<br>very deadly way in other nations around<br>the world<br>such as india where many coronavirus<br>conspiracy theories have been targeting<br>muslim populations that have led<br>to violence against muslim communities<br>within<br>within india in south africa there have<br>been reports of nurses<br>being physically removed from public<br>transport by members of the public<br>who viewed the nurses as carriers of the<br>coronavirus<br>so being infected with the with the<br>disease with coven 19<br>is is not a choice and certainly not<br>something that<br>that should be a portion to blame<br>instead we should see it as a pandemic<br>that requires a fundamental change<br>in actually how we deal with each other<br>we have a crisis upon a crisis when it<br>comes to this<br>and there's two ways of going forward<br>first is understanding what viruses are<br>about<br>and second understanding why stigma<br>occurs in the first place<br>so here's the point i'm i'm watching the<br>clock here and uh i think jackie's given<br>me<br>just just just under an hour or so to to<br>chat to you<br>about these about these issues and i'll<br>say that as tony mentioned i do teach a<br>class on pandemic management<br>and i find that teaching in the online<br>world uh sometimes we need just to<br>take a pause so you'll see some um some<br>snippets from my class including some<br>some musical interludes so i hope this<br>uh this will be an enjoyable<br>time for the next hour or so<br>so my point is in case you have to<br>schedule off early<br>is that handling the cover 19 pandemic<br>has required using<br>ancient methods like quarantine and self<br>isolation<br>shelter in place whatever you want to<br>call it these this is not really<br>advanced<br>public health methodology this is<br>incredibly old<br>and with these ancient methods come<br>about ancient problems<br>and i want to talk about that and as the<br>pandemic<br>is continuing to unfold success and<br>failure has often been measured in terms<br>of national<br>successes national levels about uh you<br>know bringing about competition and even<br>rising nationalisms<br>between what we're up until a year ago<br>very open<br>borders that uh people didn't really<br>seem to notice as much<br>but kobe 19 puts global health itself at<br>a crossroads of either entrenching<br>inward nationalisms or building<br>international cooperation<br>and there's some historical elements i<br>want to get to in this but to achieve<br>the later to achieve this idea of<br>international cooperation in the time of<br>pandemic we may need to follow the<br>example of some countries<br>in the global south in how they have<br>managed the pandemic based on best<br>practices<br>cooperation community support and<br>outreach<br>and this is something that could be a<br>very important shift<br>in global health where we don't turn to<br>london and we don't turn to washington<br>for best practices and policy going<br>forward we look to see how nations and<br>communities around the world<br>have managed to take care of each other<br>so<br>the coronavirus cover 19. as was written<br>in the economist on the august 22nd<br>edition they had a great write-up here<br>that said that<br>humans think of themselves as the<br>world's apex predators<br>which hence the silence of the<br>sabretooth tigers and<br>why there's no moas in new zealand and<br>the long list of<br>endangered megafauna have departed us<br>but<br>the covet 19 virus shows how people can<br>also<br>end up as as victims viruses have caused<br>a litany<br>of modern pandemics macular 19 to hiv<br>aids to the influenza outbreak in 1918<br>to 1920<br>which killed many more people in the<br>first world war now before that<br>colonization of the americas by<br>europeans was abetted and perhaps<br>even made possible as the geographer<br>george lovell<br>argues by epidemics and by smallpox<br>measles and influenza brought<br>unwittingly by the invaders<br>which annihilated many of the original<br>inhabitants<br>in many ways viruses are the apex<br>predator on this planet<br>they kill more living things than any<br>other organism<br>and humans we're lucky to live about 100<br>years<br>oak trees may live a thousand mayflies<br>maybe a day but they all are alive<br>in the same way they're made up of cells<br>which embody flows of energy and stores<br>of information<br>their metabolisms make up use of that<br>energy be it from sunlight or from food<br>they build new molecules they break down<br>old molecules they use mechanisms<br>described in the genes<br>they inherit it and may or may not pass<br>on<br>and then there are viruses in<br>viruses the link between metabolism and<br>genes that binds together<br>all life to which you're related is<br>broken<br>viral genes have no cells they have no<br>bodies<br>they have no metabolism of their own the<br>tiny<br>particles virions in which these genes<br>come<br>packaged the dot studded discs of the<br>coronavirus as you can see here<br>are entirely inanimate an individual<br>animal<br>or plant embodies and maintains a<br>restless metabolism<br>but a virion is just well it's an<br>arrangement of matter<br>and the virus has no plan and it has no<br>desire<br>its simplest purpose is the simplest on<br>the planet<br>to maintain the difference between what<br>is inside the cell and what is outside<br>of it<br>to move towards one chemical or away<br>from another<br>or entirely beyond it it copies itself<br>in whatever way it does simply because<br>it has copied itself<br>that way before in other cells in other<br>hosts<br>and because the virus has no plan this<br>is why it matters<br>enormously for society to have a plan<br>with dealing with a virus wash your<br>hands<br>stay at home practice social distancing<br>they're all the key public health<br>messages to slow pandemic<br>and none of this is new and really none<br>of this is about health<br>it's about combating a virus and it's an<br>important distinction to make<br>between combating a virus or promoting<br>health of a society<br>when you look at the upstream<br>determinants of health versus the<br>downstream determinants of health<br>we see a big difference here that some<br>of the the public health messaging<br>the the safety measures that have been<br>brought out by governments around the<br>world<br>are usually very downstream to that of<br>individual lifestyle factors<br>but how to go to work how to stay at<br>home how to socially distance how to<br>wash your hands<br>okay but then upstream a lot of the<br>success of that depends<br>on the economic social and cultural<br>environmental conditions in which people<br>live work play and breathe<br>so when you've got proper housing you're<br>able to to manage that that<br>that's helpful water and sanitation also<br>helpful<br>unemployment is incredibly important in<br>times of a pandemic<br>if people are told to not go to work or<br>the service industry is told to<br>not open their doors to customers if<br>there's no employment insurance<br>within that nation it's not going to be<br>as easy<br>to to maintain those practices as a<br>country that does provide<br>social services and social benefit for<br>those citizens<br>so much of the advice given is about<br>limiting the spread of the virus<br>and the question then is can it be<br>possible to address the virus<br>while ensuring health for all while<br>making sure that everyone is<br>is taken care of that the other health<br>issues in our world don't stop<br>and on that note i'm not sure<br>i'm not sure if we've got the tools i'm<br>not sure if we've got<br>the historical legacy or the emotional<br>intelligence to get through it<br>or if society is actually up for it but<br>what i do know<br>is that the more pandemic advice is<br>focused on restricting the virus<br>rather than showing the health for all<br>there are going to be consequences in<br>society<br>and one of which is stigma so here in<br>nova scotia<br>the rule of the game is if you leave<br>nova scotia<br>you have to isolate yourself in a uh<br>by yourself likely in commercial<br>accommodation<br>when you return into the province but<br>what we've got here in the atlantic<br>bubble in canada<br>is a very different message from other<br>parts of north america and as a result<br>even this simple thing just to<br>self-isolate<br>has caused quite a bit of stigmatization<br>against people<br>who are unable to practice that now<br>sci-fi<br>self-isolation quarantine there this is<br>not um<br>not new like it's it's old it<br>it's really old it's like book of<br>leviticus<br>old like old testament uh leviticus<br>1346 as long as they have the disease<br>they remain unclean they must live alone<br>they must live outside the camp<br>leviticus 13 52<br>he shall therefore burn the garment and<br>which is the plague<br>whether warp or woof or wool in linen<br>or anything in leather for its active<br>leprosy the garment shall be burned in<br>the fire<br>very old methods that were repeated and<br>and varied even during the bubonic<br>plague<br>of the medieval times the 14th century<br>in europe<br>physicians relied on crude and<br>unsophisticated techniques<br>such as bloodletting and boil lancing<br>practices that were dangerous as well as<br>unsanitary and superstitious practices<br>such as burning<br>aromatic herbs and bathing in rose water<br>and vinegar to get rid of plague<br>and meanwhile in a panic healthy people<br>did all they could<br>to avoid being sick the doctors refused<br>to see patients<br>priests refused to administer last rites<br>and shopkeepers close their stores<br>many people fled the cities for the<br>countryside but even there<br>they could not escape the disease<br>because it affected cows sheeps goats<br>pigs chickens as well as people<br>in fact so many died that one of the<br>consequences of black death<br>was actually a european wool shortage<br>from the mortality of sheep<br>many people desperate to save themselves<br>even abandon their sick and dying loved<br>ones<br>and thus doing each thought to secure<br>immunity for themselves<br>in 1665 in the village of vm<br>in in england the history of plague<br>showed up there after in 1665<br>a flea infested bundle of cloth arrived<br>from london<br>to the local tailor and as the disease<br>spread the villagers turned to<br>leadership from the rector who is a<br>reverend william<br>mom pessim and the ejected puritan<br>minister thomas<br>stanley they introduced a number of<br>precautions to slow the spread of<br>illness from<br>may of 1666 and the measures included<br>arrangements that families were to bury<br>their dead<br>and relocation of church services to the<br>natural amphitheater<br>but many also agreed with the idea of<br>isolating themselves<br>in essentially building a wall around<br>the village so that the plague couldn't<br>come in<br>but the plague ran its course over 14<br>months as it came in<br>by rats and mice and not by people so<br>the self-isolated<br>village killed at least 260 villagers<br>with only 83 surviving out of a<br>population of 350.<br>not knowing the disease was spread by<br>vermin<br>and the barred fences did nothing to<br>help with the village<br>in fact it intensified it<br>so these are the old ways of<br>self-isolation<br>they had problems then even when<br>vaccines were introduced<br>there were still controversies fast<br>forward to the age of vaccines and new<br>challenges come with new methods<br>methods so this is oswaldo cruz<br>who is the brazilian physician and<br>public health officer who sought<br>universal vaccination<br>in brazil between 1904 and 1908<br>and during that time by the thousands<br>brazilians were dying of<br>the disease of smallpox and while<br>doctors were bleeding the morbid<br>healers were scaring off the plague with<br>smoldering cowdung<br>oswaldo cruz in charge of public health<br>decided to make<br>vaccination obligatory for everyone in<br>brazil<br>challenging this with senator ruiz<br>barbosa who is a<br>pigeon chested and smooth tongue orator<br>who attacked vaccination using juridical<br>weapons that were<br>flowery with adjectives in the name of<br>liberty<br>rui barbosa defended the right of every<br>individual<br>to be contaminated with smallpox if he<br>so desires<br>torrential applause through the<br>legislature ovations<br>interrupted him from phrase to phrase<br>the politicians begin to evol oppose<br>vaccination in brazil<br>then the doctors and the journalists and<br>every newspaper began to carry<br>coloric editorials and cruel caricatures<br>victimizing as waddle crews he could not<br>show his face in any street<br>with having insults and stones thrown at<br>him<br>so the whole country of brazil closed<br>rank against vaccination<br>on all sides the legislation was<br>defeated in 1908<br>down with vaccination is heard and<br>against vaccination the cadets of the<br>military camp<br>the military academy rose in arms and<br>just<br>missed overthrowing the president but in<br>1908<br>smallpox took rio de janeiro as odd<br>waldo cruz had predicted<br>where 9 000 people died within a single<br>month<br>to which crews set up vaccination posts<br>across the city<br>and people rushed to them on mass<br>essentially when a society is dealing<br>with a health issue that it doesn't<br>fully understand<br>there's going to be reactions and much<br>of the advice given out today<br>about covet 19 is about limiting the<br>spread of the virus<br>and the question then is can it be<br>possible to address the virus<br>while ensuring health for all and on<br>that note again<br>said i'm not fully sure and part of that<br>uncertainty i think extends from<br>maybe we don't know how to define health<br>right<br>how would you define health if you've if<br>you've got your phone with you because i<br>know you've scanned that qr code<br>you can look up the definition of health<br>on your phone dictionary and you might<br>get something like this the state of<br>being<br>free from illness or injury is one<br>definition of health now this is usually<br>how medical<br>schools begin to approach what health is<br>being free from something<br>not having illness or injury and that's<br>slightly problematic from the point of<br>view of writing dictionaries<br>because if you were to look up the<br>definition of<br>an apple you would find that it would be<br>very detailed<br>definition the round fruit of a tree of<br>the rose family which typically has thin<br>green or red skin and crisp flesh<br>if you were to buy a dictionary and it<br>said that the definition of an<br>apple is not<br>an orange you'd probably leave the<br>dictionary on the shelf<br>because dictionaries are not supposed to<br>define something for which they're not<br>and yet when you look at the various<br>definitions of health<br>one and three come from biology<br>textbooks two and four<br>come from medical textbooks we see that<br>this is often the starting point<br>about ridding people from injury or<br>illness<br>very little policy even though the<br>at the higher levels it's talked about<br>quite profusely<br>about a state of complete mental and<br>social well-being is actually imposed<br>for all some people will benefit<br>others won't and that i think is the<br>issue the final definition number five<br>there is a world health organization<br>definition<br>state of complete mental and social<br>well-being so<br>let's just let's just have a peek at<br>that survey how are we all doing here<br>the 25 you thanks for participating you<br>guys are uh<br>you're rock stars i love it thank you so<br>much indeed<br>um so we are<br>we're here and as you can see the survey<br>here is that a lot of people<br>who have provided feedback feel that new<br>zealand<br>is has done well this is at the top uh<br>then canada then cuba sierra leone india<br>and the united states<br>is is down here in sixth place in terms<br>of dealing with<br>the coven 19 pandemic so that's good<br>let's let's uh let's come back to that<br>in a minute<br>feel free to chime in if you can<br>now i think a lot of the praise that's<br>come to places like new zealand<br>and uh to an extent canada has been<br>the from closing borders from isolation<br>of a population the team of five million<br>god i love that that's a<br>man who came up with that that's that's<br>that's the right stuff i love it<br>and part of that also comes from a<br>history history of pandemics<br>where we go back to the case of samoa<br>which i'm sure many of you are familiar<br>with<br>about the division of samoa between the<br>new zealand government side<br>back after world war one to that of the<br>american side<br>where of course the new zealand sign<br>allowed vessels<br>such as the uh the tulun<br>this vessel here to enter ports wound up<br>spreading<br>influenza during that time to an<br>absolutely devastating effect<br>uh 22 percent of the population of<br>of samoa uh died within within two<br>months it's 38 000 people<br>who succumbed to influenza whereas the<br>american side<br>at the time did not allow vessels to<br>come in<br>and remained free of of influenza during<br>that time of the pandemic<br>now that's often cited and still to the<br>day sort of you know an older method<br>this is not new<br>about restricting movement as being able<br>to then restrict the virus you stop<br>moving the virus<br>you've effectively rid the virus<br>all together and we and we see that<br>after the new zealand example other<br>countries around the world<br>uh followed suit back in 1918 uh<br>here in the city of kelowna british<br>columbia and<br>interior british columbia the social<br>restrictions were put in place<br>prohibitions of movement were put in<br>place<br>and we also see other cases where here<br>at the border<br>this uh rendition of the border between<br>italy and switzerland<br>during the time of the influenza shows a<br>an italian camp with swiss occupants<br>that were<br>quarantined just in the border the<br>border regions there<br>so the idea about isolating and<br>restricting movements and travel<br>could you know it there was there was<br>merit to it<br>in in 1918 and still we've seen some<br>efficacy<br>today it's still regarded as some of the<br>best practices and pandemic management<br>but the challenges have gotten harder<br>and the challenges have gotten harder is<br>because we're not<br>rolling around the world in steam ships<br>we we're cruising in emirates<br>a380s which can transport 615 people<br>from dubai to pretty much any airport on<br>earth<br>within 15 hours i mean if there's ever a<br>symbol of globalization this is it<br>and the airlines have come under very<br>heavy scrutiny for their<br>their internal hygiene standards and<br>worries about virus transmission<br>i mean to the point where emirates<br>themselves will will pay for your<br>funeral<br>if you uh succumb to kobe 19 having<br>taken one of their flights<br>admittedly the new cleaning practices on<br>aircraft i think actually calls into<br>question just<br>just how low the bar was pre-pandemic<br>so that also bears reflection on some of<br>the ancient approaches<br>not just the pandemic management but to<br>to airline hygiene<br>and i bring this in for for a good<br>reason that<br>this is not a new idea that's been<br>kicked around that in fact<br>in 1933 to 1935<br>league of nations international sanitary<br>convention for aerial navigation<br>dealt with exactly this issue that there<br>was<br>a worry that air transport was going to<br>have the capacity<br>to speed up global transmission of<br>viruses around<br>the world so the airlines again<br>have come under scrutiny but this<br>conversation started<br>in the 1930s now before planes and<br>before<br>steam and the age of sale it was<br>actually difficult to get anywhere in<br>the planet<br>in under 14 days between international<br>ports excluding<br>europe of course so that in itself puts<br>you in a 14-day self-isolation if there<br>was disease on board<br>14 days or so at sea or being in<br>anchorage would take care of it but the<br>age of steam sped it up<br>greatly and hence the story of the 1918<br>to 1920 influenza outbreak around the<br>world and<br>the steam carriers were able to move<br>faster and quicker<br>and and and carry people with with them<br>to other ports<br>so when it came to the age of aircraft<br>the league of nations health committee<br>became greatly concerned<br>to quote to say that sanitary<br>aerodromes so at all time have at their<br>disposal<br>an organized medical service with one<br>medical officer<br>at least and one more sanitary inspector<br>for each flight<br>it being understood that this staff will<br>not necessarily be in permanent<br>attendance in the eardrum<br>but there should be a place for medical<br>expansion inspection equipment for<br>taking and dispatching suspected<br>material<br>and examination and have a laboratory<br>within within reasonable distance<br>have facilities in the case of necessity<br>for the isolation<br>transport and care of the sick for the<br>isolation of contacts separately from<br>the sick<br>and for carrying out any other<br>prophylactic measures<br>in suitable premises either within the<br>aerodrome or in proximity to it<br>the apparatus necessary for carrying out<br>disinfection<br>disinfectization and derivatization if<br>required<br>as well as any other measure laid down<br>in the present convention<br>the aerodrome should be provided with<br>sufficient supply of wholesome drinking<br>water<br>and with a proper and safe system for<br>the disposal of<br>excreta and refuse for the removal of<br>wastewater<br>the aerodrum shell as far as possible be<br>protected from rats<br>well that's nice but the idea is that<br>the original idea of airports<br>wasn't about you know having shopping<br>malls with inside of them<br>that it was originally about setting<br>them up as first line<br>medical medical inspection like<br>almost like many hospitals and<br>quarantine facilities that was the<br>concern<br>and as we know this was not followed at<br>all and it was not followed<br>because of absolute colonial hubris<br>if i may quote the american journal of<br>public health<br>editorial board in 1933 to say that so<br>far we've been able to overcome the<br>principal diseases<br>found in the trade routes of the world<br>and there is little doubt that we will<br>accomplish the same with respect to<br>airplane travel<br>because until now the limitations and<br>expense<br>of traveling by airplane have been such<br>to limit the risks<br>in that and here we go this is this is<br>direct quote<br>right from the page editorial board 1933<br>because only the richer and better class<br>of people as a rule travel by airplane<br>so there's no need for such measures to<br>be imposed<br>it would surprise no one however to see<br>air travel become much<br>cheaper through the introduction of<br>planes that could carry a hundred<br>passengers or more<br>so it is high time for us to go beyond<br>regarding the airplane as a curiosity<br>and a wonder and to recognize that has<br>come to be a mainstay of transportation<br>however as we see now with here is is<br>the scene in halifax this is the<br>this is the quarantine uh inspection at<br>halifax airport it's uh<br>some leftover card tables and a luggage<br>cart with a sign<br>and uh this is what we have because<br>the idea of actually ensuring health or<br>dealing with viruses was forgotten in<br>airport design for about a good 70 years<br>and now we're<br>cracking up the card tables and getting<br>people to come over and<br>and fill out forms so in in canada<br>uh this is really telling because<br>i see from the survey canada is ranking<br>fairly high in your in your opinions but<br>is a tricky place because when it comes<br>to healthcare there's not just one<br>canada there's 13<br>canadas health is the business of the<br>provinces not the nation<br>so the ottawa the the capital can give<br>advice<br>but it's up to the the each province to<br>deal with health in their own way<br>so what's actually happening here is a<br>reimagination<br>of nationalisms uh even within within<br>the country<br>if you if you roll back to some of the<br>work that benedict anderson did in the<br>1980s monumental book on imagine<br>communities<br>where he argued that nations were a<br>socially constructed community that were<br>imagined by people<br>who perceive themselves to be part of a<br>group part of a group<br>and it's imagined because the members<br>even the smallest nation<br>pitcairn excluded will will never know<br>most of their fellow members<br>meet them or even hear from them yet in<br>the minds of each<br>lives let lives the image of the<br>communion of each other<br>so even though compatriots will will not<br>know each other you'll never meet<br>everyone in the team of five million<br>they they may hold in their minds a<br>mental image of their affinity<br>for example the nation had felt when<br>other members of your own nation<br>when your imagined community<br>participates in a larger event with<br>success<br>such as the olympics such as the war or<br>actions against the pandemic and what<br>we're seeing here<br>here are the here are the new the<br>all-stars of of canada<br>no it's not a hockey team these are the<br>public health officers from<br>uh ottawa there teresa tam in the in the<br>top left and then the other provinces<br>as you can see here these guys and gals<br>are rock stars<br>in terms of public support for the<br>measures that they've taken<br>but here we've got a country that is<br>based on 13 interlocking systems to<br>develop standards agree on policy<br>and yet allow for regional differences<br>and most<br>most nations of equal size populations<br>can't can't pull this off<br>so we see now that there's borders<br>between<br>uh provinces which we've never seen<br>before<br>we've seen mandatory quarantines between<br>provinces that's new<br>and here in nova scotia we've actually<br>seen probably one of the best<br>controlled measures of of cobit 19<br>anywhere<br>in the country again returning nova<br>scotia you must self-isolate<br>that said the broader challenges of<br>stigmatization still exist not just here<br>in canada but also to the united states<br>referring back to donald trump here of<br>course there's a great report done in<br>the national geographic<br>that came out about america's long<br>history of scapegoating to its asian<br>citizens<br>about how many people in the united<br>states were blaming<br>asian americans or people who appear to<br>be of asian descent<br>for the virus a very telling photo here<br>from that report<br>that as news of kobe 19 began ramping up<br>in january<br>carl and chan heard rumors in chinatown<br>residents being harassed<br>so he started patrolling the streets of<br>his neighborhood to make sure residents<br>felt safe<br>he posted about his patrols on social<br>media and dozens of people<br>began walking with them and as you can<br>see the photos in this photo journeys<br>just show the kind of<br>stigma that was given to a<br>man who appeared to be evasion descent<br>walking through a public eating area<br>the quiet but yet<br>menacing<br>lewd stairs i suppose it's led the cdc<br>to have a whole the center for disease<br>control in the united states to have a<br>whole program on reducing stigma that's<br>part of it<br>and other countries as well i've been<br>dealing with this we've seen reports<br>from australia<br>about asian australians threatened and<br>spat on and racist<br>incidents amid coronavirus and 377<br>incidents of<br>anti-asian racism in two months took<br>place<br>of course in new zealand human rights<br>commission launched his new campaign<br>after<br>asian discrimination reports during the<br>kobe pandemic<br>and anti-asian hate crime incidents were<br>up 878 percent in vancouver<br>compared to the year before and what<br>we're seeing is that while there is<br>quite a focus on<br>asian americans or asian canadians or<br>people who appear to be of asian descent<br>it's now spread to other groups right so<br>if you appear<br>to be from america and coming up into<br>canada<br>you will probably be punished for that<br>if you are a nurse<br>you will be punished for that or the<br>family of a nurse or an essential worker<br>you may find that society will punish<br>you through<br>giada comments stigmatization isolation<br>you name it and i think part of it is<br>also the slightly blamed towards<br>hollywood where if you look at how the<br>the manifestation of pop culture around<br>pandemics is played out it's usually<br>the lone survivor up against all that<br>that most people aren't going to make it<br>but that one individual<br>will so taken together<br>as i said the virus has no plan it has<br>no desire<br>which is why our plans matter and not<br>just<br>in the fight against it but in how we<br>really do take care of each other if we<br>organize<br>in a way that divides us<br>and others us the virus wins<br>making people based on their identity<br>feel vulnerable and intimidated while<br>then encouraging other groups to defy<br>social ordinances gives the virus<br>incredible<br>advantage for example a shoulder to<br>shoulder trump rally<br>which are lily white and the crowd<br>attendees are shoulder to shoulder<br>chanting china virus and kung flu<br>that gives covid19 the advantage<br>so all that we know about stigma right<br>that comes from the top orders of<br>world health organization and good<br>government policy about<br>people who are likely to be stigmatized<br>during this event<br>ways to try to share facts to try to<br>adopt productive measures to use<br>inclusive language to bust<br>miss to reorient how we're actually<br>doing<br>these are all steps in the right<br>direction but isn't enough<br>so let's just check in on that survey<br>again to see how we're doing<br>and there we go 27 so when it comes to<br>stigma<br>just for the last little bit of my my<br>discussion with you folks here<br>let's actually check in on these nations<br>to see how they're<br>to see how they're doing and uh<br>again i'm getting a little bit dry in<br>the throat so i may throw in some<br>musical interludes or some media clips<br>with this so new zealand's in first<br>place for handling the pandemic and<br>bygar i think<br>that's that's deserved i think that's<br>all right but how is new zealand doing<br>when uh when it comes to stigma or just<br>as we see here i'm sure you remember<br>this<br>this video look at the rest of the world<br>you know they were trying to say oh we<br>weren't doing now all of a sudden a lot<br>of the<br>the places that they were using to hold<br>up they're having a big surge<br>they're having a and i don't want that i<br>don't want that but they were holding up<br>names of countries and now they're<br>saying whoops<br>in fact even new zealand you see what's<br>going on in new zealand<br>they beat it they beat it it was like<br>front page they beat it because they<br>wanted to show me something the problem<br>is<br>big surge in new zealand so you know<br>obviously i don't think there's any<br>comparison between new zealand's<br>current cluster and the tens of<br>thousands of cases that are being seen<br>daily<br>in the united states obviously every<br>country<br>is experiencing its own fight<br>with covert 19 it is a tricky virus but<br>not one where i would compare new<br>zealand's current status to the united<br>states<br>look i think for anyone and rightly so i<br>mean new zealand has done a fantastic<br>job<br>in um in dealing with this and and what<br>we've seen here<br>especially from the leadership in in new<br>zealand is not just about closing<br>borders and ports or<br>or you know as you can tune into the gdp<br>podcast and hear about tony binz's<br>time in quarantine it's about using<br>inclusive language<br>which i will come back to at the very<br>end of this and say that this is<br>something<br>on behalf of scholars and policymakers<br>in new zealand<br>to make that voice louder because the<br>world needs to<br>to hear how it's done to to try to see<br>how inclusivity can take place in action<br>and still as it is occurring it doesn't<br>mean that the job is done<br>there still continues to be reports from<br>the new zealand human rights commission<br>about continued complaints that are<br>received<br>about discrimination against people the<br>bureau of asian descent in new zealand<br>and again you've got the the comments<br>section<br>down here that can continue to<br>perpetuate that<br>some of the campaigns that are going on<br>in new zealand again<br>top rate uh ways of trying to connect<br>with people<br>in terms of not just ordering them since<br>the start of the pandemic there's been a<br>huge wave of people blaming asian new<br>zealanders for everything that's going<br>on<br>look i get it you're scared we all are<br>you're scared you and your family are<br>going to catch the virus you're scared<br>you're going to lose your job<br>you're scared it's not going to go away<br>anytime soon it's a scary time<br>and you might feel like you need to find<br>someone to blame for it but just stop<br>and think for a second<br>do you really think that helen from your<br>office purposely brought covert here<br>from china<br>no of course not she was at a cafe<br>having overpriced smashed ava or just<br>like everyone else<br>also she's korean she's never even been<br>to china and even if she had that's<br>irrelevant all right just leave her<br>alone<br>look what i'm trying to say is everyone<br>is having a hard time at the moment<br>and blaming innocent asian new<br>zealanders who are just trying to live<br>their life<br>isn't going to make that go away we're<br>all in the same boat<br>let's look out for each other racism<br>it's no joke so again i think that's<br>kind of inclusive<br>ways of dealing with with stigma right<br>but it's not enough to just say we've<br>done this once<br>and that's it it's got to be a<br>continuous process<br>uh the survey says that canada has done<br>well well let's check in on uh<br>on uh on canada again uh you know<br>welcome<br>the avenue<br>from mcmac mcmuggy here in nova scotia<br>how is canada done well we were doing<br>okay<br>and then as i say here in nova scotia<br>then the arse came out of her<br>we were pretty much on track in the<br>summertime<br>uh june and july and august especially<br>being next to<br>the world's largest area of coven 19<br>but then in quebec in the fall<br>it we lost it and it's spiking about a<br>thousand plus cases a day there<br>which means that provinces like mine<br>here in nova scotia which continue to be<br>flat<br>are locking down more and more and uh<br>the thing is about looking at canada we<br>can't actually look at as one nation<br>we've got to look at it by region<br>and uh we'll we'll talk about that but i<br>think these policies and ordinances here<br>some of them have been more stigmatizing<br>and<br>some have not and the ones here in nova<br>scotia the stricter ones<br>so this is our premier premier mcneil it<br>means<br>the message well it's for everyone's own<br>good if not a<br>tad repetitive but in nova scotia just<br>as people might have been lulled into<br>complacency<br>came this little gem from premier<br>stephen mcneil<br>when all we have to do is stay the<br>blaze's home<br>it sounded kind of cross but look at<br>what is normally halifax's busiest<br>downtown street hardly a soul that<br>scolding might just be getting through<br>to people<br>what did the premiere see you to do stay<br>the blazes home<br>stay the blaze's home and then amid all<br>this isolation<br>you guessed home it<br>the blazers home think about the common<br>good stay the blazes home<br>the songwriters took over in this case<br>the stanfield<br>if you got the ankle and you wanna go to<br>town<br>merchandise started popping up t-shirts<br>and the like with profits going to the<br>but more than just a lark as this<br>pandemic grinds on and the messaging<br>becomes more critical<br>this kind of thing can actually be good<br>you got to find a way to break through<br>that<br>20 to 30 000 messages of clutter we get<br>each day business professor ed mchugh<br>told us from his home of course that the<br>premier was able to punch through<br>i watched and i immediately went he's<br>got it i said that that was it<br>it clicked for me and it clicked for a<br>lot of people you got to find<br>something that stands out and it's even<br>what works best<br>is slightly tongue-in-cheek that that<br>works better than the straight<br>scientific<br>information that we get you know right<br>now every single day<br>to go and get your fix to party with<br>your buddies<br>and drink a beer or six now in nova<br>scotia there are no kitchen parties<br>allowed at this time<br>social distancing and all but there's a<br>beer<br>further evidence that this catchphrase<br>is really catching on<br>it's okay to find the humor in these<br>words after all<br>we could all use a bit of humor now but<br>it's very important that people<br>understand and heed the message<br>behind the words a potentially effective<br>message that<br>may help ward off the virus and a little<br>creativity<br>to deal with that cabin fever tom murphy<br>cbc news halifax<br>so there we go we get a bit of a<br>scolding from um<br>from like your principal to to say stay<br>the blazes home<br>and it has it's caught on but in that<br>that's okay if you're part of the club<br>because part of the policy here in nova<br>scotia<br>was again bubbling so that people who<br>were not<br>identified as living here well they<br>became targeted and we're starting to<br>see uh<br>greater evidence of that so again our<br>pal here<br>uh benjamin head he was a big<br>ghostbusters fan he<br>uh he got a note on his car so um<br>let me talk to you about what i've had<br>to do to mine<br>so just to give you an example from my<br>own personal life here in nova scotia<br>we've been very fortunate during the<br>kobe 19 pandemic<br>uh to have very low case counts very<br>little mortality because we all take<br>precautions such as wearing masks we all<br>have to do that<br>and even with a bit of pride having the<br>nova scotia tartan on the mask<br>but so too have i had to take<br>precautions when driving around this<br>province because this vehicle here<br>which is in desperate need of a bath uh<br>has<br>license plates from the garden state and<br>as people have taken notice<br>of new jersey plates here in nova scotia<br>there's been quite a consistent and<br>frequent bombardment of<br>harassment from microaggressions in<br>grocery stores<br>to outright confrontations and other<br>parking lots<br>to physical altercations on the edge of<br>breaking out<br>so some of the precautions we've had to<br>take were to put<br>the home sticker on here to remind<br>people that in fact<br>we live here and even the the medicare<br>for all<br>sticker a uh something to remind the<br>good people in nova scotia that we share<br>this value<br>of uh of medicare not uh not like mr<br>trump<br>would believe so again this car and<br>myself been here for the entirety of the<br>pandemic but even one step further<br>is that i wound up getting a nova scotia<br>license plate<br>flag to put on top<br>of what was the new jersey license plate<br>because in nova scotia<br>you only have to have a back plate so<br>when i back the car<br>into a parking lot hiding the back plate<br>i hope that the nova scotia plate deters<br>some of the more frequent harassment<br>that<br>so as the days go on here in nova scotia<br>we hear the<br>the premier and the chief health officer<br>continue to talk to us every day about<br>updates with clover19 but we what we<br>don't hear<br>is uh the underlying stories about uh<br>how people are are are not doing well<br>during this time so uh they get up there<br>they do their thing and<br>you know they kind of reminisce into<br>this<br>and it's cute this is actually a local<br>tongue antique<br>joke about the premier and the uh the<br>public health officer here<br>but what we do hear more about now that<br>with we've got the nova scotia covered<br>stigma survey on now about people who<br>identify as asian<br>people who live outside of uh the<br>of the atlantic bubble uh people who are<br>have to travel for work<br>their experiences were starting to get<br>uh<br>some pretty pretty disturbing<br>cases about about just how the community<br>is is behaving towards these groups of<br>people<br>the other group uh and that's that's<br>where we'll leave that that stigma is<br>definitely occurring here<br>now the other group that uh has fared<br>well in your survey<br>is of course cuba and um as tony<br>mentioned i've got a uh<br>real font affection for cuba so let's<br>see how they're doing and let's listen<br>to some music<br>mariah<br>foreign<br>and there we go now cuba has done very<br>well<br>for containing code 19 within its own<br>borders<br>but it's also sent its own health<br>workers abroad and that is something<br>that no other country has done<br>in the same way where you've got<br>hundreds of cuban doctors that have<br>provided care as you can see from that<br>map<br>that popped up there to both rich<br>countries and poor countries<br>alike so here's the delegation arriving<br>i believe this is in angola<br>and we've got here even some first<br>nations chiefs in canada<br>asking the federal government to allow<br>cuban doctors to come in to help the<br>cause<br>here are this is a convoy<br>of cruise ship passengers that are taken<br>to a quarantine and treatment facility<br>within havana after their cruise ship<br>was basically left drift at sea where no<br>other nation would bring them in<br>now cuba's got a long history of medical<br>internationalism i don't have time to<br>get into it tonight<br>but one thing is for sure is that it's<br>the only nation that said right we are<br>going to put our public health<br>work in place at home and in a way that<br>can also help others abroad<br>that i believe is completely exceptional<br>especially<br>when cuba's economy is absolutely in the<br>basket<br>you've got cues like this for food<br>stuffs you've got shortages of bounding<br>it's not easy at home when you've also<br>got<br>the realization that you're helping all<br>these countries around the world and yet<br>at home<br>you can barely get enough groceries on<br>the table that's caused some tension<br>so much so that the cuban government is<br>even thinking about revaluing its<br>currencies<br>as a result of the pandemic now<br>good for you uh conference attendees for<br>putting sierra leone where you did<br>i couldn't agree more with your uh<br>positioning on this one sierra leone<br>has done uh incredibly well<br>during the pandemic it uh it's had very<br>very low case counts<br>initially there was some reports in<br>medical journals to say<br>that they were trying to attribute it to<br>the lack of coping 19 due to biological<br>resistance<br>of the region as we see here very low<br>cases and then someone said<br>hold on uh we've we've seen pandemics<br>before in west africa<br>we know what we're doing and sure enough<br>that's the case<br>right you've had as the coronavirus<br>spread in january<br>you had top level officials in sierra<br>leone meet with other international<br>experts<br>to get a pandemic plan in place to<br>figure out public education strategies<br>to figure out quarantine measures to<br>think about travel plans between<br>districts<br>in fact it's very very extensive and<br>also combined with that having gone<br>through the ebola epidemic in 2014<br>conscious effort towards stigmatization<br>right with the ebola workers themselves<br>had figured this you see that in sierra<br>leone this is actually<br>part of the package the former director<br>of liberia's public health institute<br>says that the u.s center for disease<br>control<br>had actually helped to teach health<br>officials in the region<br>the methods during the public health<br>outbreak and and the thing is<br>that teaching uh was very much a part of<br>the president obama<br>playbook for pandemics the copy that<br>trump never got<br>so uh fun fact uh that when<br>when word broke out amongst some of the<br>the the<br>the diplomats in west africa that uh<br>they're using the us<br>playbook and and look the cases are<br>surging surging in the us<br>where this is this thing doesn't work<br>someone said well actually no<br>the u.s isn't actually using it<br>themselves so just<br>just keep going business as usual and<br>and they did<br>and there's certainly concern for<br>increased uptake there's resource<br>shortfalls<br>there's serious issues in sierra leone<br>that by putting in<br>lockdowns and restrictions and curfews<br>you're really digging into people's<br>livelihoods right and this this<br>is a very risky and challenging thing to<br>do<br>especially in times of um<br>of you know when there's no social<br>assistance or social services<br>available there and finally uh we won't<br>get too much into it but<br>india uh india has imposed some of the<br>world's<br>strictest kobit 19 measures anywhere in<br>the world some 40 days<br>of lockdown that was combined for more<br>weeks on top of it<br>and again with something where there's a<br>lot of<br>mistrust going on within india using<br>social media<br>that blames the kobe 19 pandemic on<br>muslim minority communities throughout<br>the country uh<br>there's been evidence of police<br>assisting in the violence that's<br>been targeted against muslim muslim<br>indians and<br>this again is a really grave uh<br>condition of it but again<br>couched in the idea of nationalism that<br>that in this case uh you know as much as<br>we've seen<br>nationalism take on its forms either as<br>form of pride or a form of<br>of of you know whatever uh india<br>uh went up targeting the minorities and<br>finally in last place<br>is the united states and um<br>no better way to describe it about how<br>culture has been in the u.s<br>making your way in the world today takes<br>everything you've got<br>it hasn't been a good time in the united<br>states for the cocoa 19 pandemic<br>again a gentleman here who was febrezed<br>on a<br>new york subway people storming walmarts<br>to not wear a mask to open defiance of<br>the mask orders<br>and now uh on his way out<br>got one more concern to deal with here<br>is that we can see<br>quite much on a global scale just how<br>out of touch the united states is<br>but the problem is is that you did have<br>71 million people<br>who are actively supporting<br>and venerating the last four years there<br>which<br>was against 76 million people on the<br>other side<br>that is a cause for concern that is<br>something that i believe<br>is worrisome and that means the work<br>isn't over yet<br>so final words i know i've got a little<br>bit over time here do apologize for that<br>and uh we'll just wrap it up but<br>on stigma and the pandemic regardless<br>how well or how poorly a country is<br>fared and handling covet 19<br>cases stigma othering and nationalism<br>are going to remain a challenge<br>and depending on the governance at the<br>top depending on the actions of the<br>community and depending on<br>the ability to actually create<br>resilience for people's own health<br>that is going to matter even in<br>countries that celebrate compassion<br>and mindfulness towards stigma at the<br>community level<br>the tension at the community level<br>matters not just in combating the virus<br>but in actually taking care of each<br>other right not othering not<br>blaming not doing that kind of event<br>cuba and sierra leone are both<br>low-income countries and they have done<br>incredibly well to address the pandemic<br>within their own borders despite<br>absolutely crippling economic<br>circumstances and that needs to be noted<br>and global health has traditionally been<br>about wealthy nations giving poor<br>nations advice<br>we might be seeing the tides turn on<br>that so<br>when it comes to health promotion and<br>disease prevention<br>final final thoughts on it let me<br>provide you with some recommendations<br>about an era when we're using ancient<br>methods in a modern pandemic<br>first up if you practice a politics of<br>compassion<br>be braver than national pride and<br>embrace solidarity<br>to everyone who faces similar challenges<br>if you choose to live in bubbles remain<br>inclusive to all<br>who want to be with you remember that is<br>the behavior<br>within a community that matters not the<br>identity bestowed<br>upon people if you have gone through a<br>horrific epidemic<br>build educate and then rebuild for the<br>next one<br>if social media tells you to hate your<br>neighbor tell it off<br>better yet turn it off<br>and if you choose to help others going<br>through struggles remember to take care<br>of yourself in the process<br>and if you live in a country with a<br>delusional egotistical xenophobic racist<br>as a leader<br>vote them out because that will improve<br>everyone's health<br>so i just want to finish up again on one<br>final thing<br>something that the university of otago's<br>very own kevin clements<br>posted on social media a few weeks back<br>kevin said that the old style<br>adversarial politics are not what people<br>want anymore<br>and most people understand that all the<br>wicked problems the world faces requires<br>the best minds and expertise available<br>from across<br>the political spectrum and the task is<br>how to practice the loving caring<br>politics while being bold<br>decisive unpopular when the challenges<br>need immediate short and long-term<br>progressive radical action<br>i don't think anyone said it better that<br>was fantastic kevin if<br>you can relay the message to him for<br>that but that's exactly what our next<br>steps are<br>this kobe 19 pandemic has been a global<br>experience that conjoins us all<br>and to get to that state to find the<br>moments when<br>compassion becomes strength and the<br>moments when that<br>strength then leads us towards health<br>rather than just<br>having a fearful fight against the virus<br>that that is going to be the ingredient<br>for global health in the 21st century<br>so thank you very much otago it is<br>always a pleasure<br>to hang out with you even if it's<br>yeah bob thank you very much indeed that<br>was<br>absolutely fascinating and totally<br>engaging<br>um we've got a few minutes now for for<br>questions we're going to pass a<br>microphone round otherwise bob won't<br>be able to hear you um so um<br>would anybody just say you're doing that<br>tony if i can just jump in<br>um thank you all for participating in<br>that uh survey here that i'm<br>i'm sharing with you at the moment i've<br>got one more for you<br>uh so if you are able to uh uh<br>use your phone to chime into that qr<br>code do it at your leisure<br>and we'll chat about the results on<br>twitter<br>down the road it's just going to ask you<br>to to offer a few words about stigma but<br>i'm<br>happy to hear any questions that the<br>audience has yeah<br>thanks bob thank you did anybody like to<br>kick off um yes at the back<br>thank you bob uh it was a very<br>comprehensive coherent and very engaging<br>presentation thanks for that<br>highly informative as well uh i<br>there is no question uh just that um<br>coming from india my thoughts<br>there was no racist action or racist<br>opinion about muslims<br>in what india was concerned was there<br>was this talbiki jamaat<br>which congregated during the pandemic<br>and<br>it became a hot spot uh<br>and became um cause<br>of 4000 cases and 27 deaths which were<br>related to<br>it in spite of this the congregation<br>had uh did not allow the authorities<br>for quarantining and they continued to<br>assemble in mosques in spite of<br>uh spiking pandemic that was the concern<br>and the government had to use force as<br>it did with anybody<br>else so when we are talking on an<br>international platform it is very<br>important<br>that the hatred message is not sent<br>around<br>yeah that's a really good point um bob<br>do you want to<br>chip in on that yeah yeah no that's the<br>the spreading of that case<br>is really um is really you know<br>as you described the the unfortunate<br>thing that comes with it though<br>is how people respond react to it or<br>you know express their sentiment and the<br>hard truth is is that there's a lot<br>of anti-muslim sentiment that came<br>through social media<br>and has been echoed in other channels<br>against muslim communities in in india<br>and and this is where it gets tense<br>because if there's a disobedience of<br>order<br>uh you know what where is the policy<br>failing in that<br>and then how does does something in that<br>case then<br>translate into harmful or hurtful<br>reactions<br>and that's where i think you know we've<br>got to be better<br>um about and try to find ways that that<br>avoid that that harmful consequence<br>where people who uh you know are then<br>attacked or profiled based on on how<br>they identify as to<br>what the nature of the circumstance was<br>yeah i'd go along with that it's very<br>useful to get the<br>the more detail from you though on this<br>that's wonderful thank you<br>yeah okay right yes thank you<br>um could we bring somebody else in um<br>bob thank you for your presentation um<br>during the lockdown here in new zealand<br>we had an item appeared i went worldwide<br>called the great pause that<br>was predicated on the belief that the<br>way we were doing things<br>economically and socially was not fit<br>for purpose<br>and many people were worse off because<br>of<br>the way we design their economy<br>and the lockdown was a chance for<br>reflection on<br>new ways of doing things what's the move<br>or the motivation in<br>canada for you know positioning<br>ourselves<br>different going forward yeah you know<br>it's a great point i mean it's it's very<br>quick uh<br>when there's a big change any any change<br>uh to say the economic impacts are going<br>to make us<br>suffer hard uh and and<br>often that that's very prudent caution<br>that gets thrown into<br>into these circumstances what we what i<br>can speak to here in nova scotia<br>is that this is a place where<br>the majority of the economy lies on<br>the fingers on your hand number one is<br>public<br>uh higher education so foreign students<br>coming to the province<br>two is the health care sector three is<br>lobster one one crustacean<br>is like a foundation for the economy<br>here and then uh lumber and then<br>uh tourism is the other thing we figured<br>that<br>with the lack of students coming in<br>stressed out healthcare system<br>crustaceans no longer going to asia<br>and tourists not coming in that the<br>place would fold<br>and actually we've seen quite the<br>opposite there's actually been an uptick<br>economy of very local level<br>entrepreneurship that<br>is is drastically changing how things<br>were done<br>and i think what is really important at<br>both<br>national and local levels is to have<br>the ability to support innovation in a<br>time like this<br>we've seen the the litany of critiques<br>of globalization about how wealth gets<br>concentrated to one group<br>how we use too much carbon in another<br>area<br>those are all valid critiques that don't<br>get dismissed from covet<br>but going forward if there's a time for<br>people to begin<br>innovations for new economies this is<br>where governments have to be brave<br>there's a small shot small i mean small<br>that mr biden may actually promote that<br>with green technology in the united<br>states it might be<br>but we've seen we've seen incidents that<br>where where governments are able to<br>support that innovation coming out of it<br>and<br>that might be something that we look at<br>for the next while<br>oh thanks um yes at the back there<br>yes<br>um thank you i really enjoyed the talk<br>and especially the sum<br>by the canadians that was really<br>creative i just have two comments the<br>first one is on stigma<br>and i wonder if stigma from the pandemic<br>highlights pre-existing stigma in the<br>society<br>um for example with hiv aids you know<br>stigma was targeted towards women<br>even though it was um transmitted by men<br>and was targeted towards the haitians<br>when the americans actually give it to<br>the haitians<br>um and i think um artillery context<br>asian people have been stigmatized um<br>previously for issues around housing for<br>example<br>so i wondered if that the pandemic just<br>exposed that a little bit more<br>and similarly um another stigma that i<br>personally experienced um during the<br>pandemic was actually towards<br>south auckland in the second wave um i'm<br>from south auckland<br>and when the second wave broke i was in<br>hospital on shift with a colleague<br>and my colleague made a very offhand<br>comment about south auckland<br>and i just i really was very annoyed<br>about that<br>so i think that's another kind of<br>dimension of stigma that's<br>relevant to our toyota context is that<br>an equity<br>um you know that is in south auckland<br>right<br>no i you're you're you're on the money<br>there um<br>stigma today in 21st century is based on<br>a lot of<br>predispositions about identities of<br>people and a lot of that is rooted in<br>really<br>really toxic coloniality we see it here<br>in canada<br>right we see especially in the united<br>states the the targeting<br>of people who appear to be from asian<br>descent just the the blame<br>the isolation it's it's not good and<br>you're right it's based on these other<br>these these historical tendencies to do<br>that<br>the the more the the other health<br>attribute to that is that when people<br>are stigmatized and people are now<br>adjusting their behavior<br>in order to minimize stigmatization they<br>then remove themselves from<br>participation in the community<br>participation in the system the<br>willingness to feel<br>open if there is a health issue to<br>report<br>and that again is something that we we<br>don't want to see like the<br>months and months of isolation has not<br>been<br>mentally healthy for anybody so then to<br>layer on stigmatization on top of that<br>only goes the extra mile and what<br>you know the the offhanded comments i<br>mean they're it's hurtful<br>right it's it's it's not great<br>to be at the front end of that and what<br>we're also seeing is that<br>there's other groups that are that are<br>being brought into this who are facing<br>that<br>um who may not have traditionally done<br>so uh<br>the people who've got connections<br>between canada and the united states<br>across the borders uh typically you know<br>americans were just<br>yeah a bit of a bit of friendly rivalry<br>in in the sports you know that was sort<br>of the thing<br>but now it's vicious i mean your your<br>your car is gonna get messed up<br>you're you are gonna get in a physical<br>altercation<br>um i don't remember<br>that before but it's also a very telling<br>reminder that when<br>a society is fearful of something and<br>the scapegoats are<br>are being presented within that<br>community the actions are horrible<br>and i think that this is going to<br>hopefully expose<br>the study we're doing here i should say<br>is going to expose a lot of hard work<br>that communities in nova scotia have to<br>do to really become inclusive<br>thank you bob what came through really<br>strongly in your talk and obviously was<br>the title of your talk<br>that the methods being used to mitigate<br>or to<br>um to manage covert 19 are ancient<br>methods<br>but obviously they are associated<br>disadvantages<br>what would you suggest as the<br>well i think the thing that we<br>that we need to start working on is<br>looking at examples<br>where things like stigma<br>things like toxic nationalism<br>aren't coming through the covet<br>experience and it's why i include<br>cuba and sierra leone on this again of<br>course they include new zealand on it<br>because of the<br>world world champion on on dealing with<br>covet<br>but the point about cuba and new zealand<br>sorry about cuba and sierra leone<br>is that these are countries that are<br>able to deal<br>with the virus in a way that<br>isn't promoting the risk of<br>stigmatization<br>in the same way that other nations are<br>there's still the risk of stigmatization<br>in both countries<br>sierra leone between the urban and the<br>rural cuba between health workers for<br>working abroad<br>and those who are inside people who have<br>a family in the united states and cuba<br>have also been subject to stigmatization<br>stigma occurs in those ways<br>but the question then is if no matter<br>what we do<br>is going to be a form of stigmatization<br>how then do we<br>do we work more towards maintaining<br>the health of people the wellness of<br>people<br>it's it's shattering to think that in<br>the united states that during covet 19<br>uh 100 000 people were at risk of losing<br>their health insurance<br>because of the virus itself i mean<br>that's a reckless policy that needs to<br>be<br>to be you know re-thought of we can't go<br>into the 22nd century with that sort of<br>archaic thinking<br>so there's no really easy answer that<br>jackie but what i think<br>we can do as scholars and policy makers<br>right now<br>is quit looking where we've looked in<br>the past right<br>quit looking in in what's going on in<br>whitehall what's going on in washington<br>what's going on in ottawa<br>let's look at what's going on in<br>freetown in havana let's<br>find ways to communicate to policymakers<br>there<br>to learn about those experiences in a<br>more deep way<br>to figure out is this working as it's<br>thank you um very interesting bob i was<br>in freetown<br>in january and people were telling me<br>how they'd cope with ebola<br>obviously it was a a terrible event but<br>they learned to cope with it to<br>quarantine to lock down<br>and so on and um they weren't complacent<br>but they were they they felt they they<br>knew how to deal with this new threat<br>um and i was really very impressed with<br>them<br>the viewpoints of the people there at<br>the time so<br>bob this has been a fascinating talk<br>um i realize it's the middle of the<br>night there in halifax<br>i'm just going to stay up tony i'm um<br>i'm going to pull the old all-nighter<br>i guess if you're in new zealand you'll<br>be having your milo<br>yeah well you know what this is like jet<br>lag without the jet yeah<br>yeah really interesting bob you've done<br>a wonderful job it's been absolutely<br>fascinating<br>and all my friends here at the<br>university of otago<br>and the leadership group of the otago<br>global health institute<br>we really want to join together to thank<br>you for putting so much<br>into this it was just so engaging<br>and i'm sure you'll all like to join<br>with me in thanking bob for this<br>so bob uh i hope we're going to see you<br>back
