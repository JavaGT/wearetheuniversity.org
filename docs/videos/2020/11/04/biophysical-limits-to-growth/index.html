enormous importance for<br>humanity<br>and i'd just like to thank um simon<br>chappell as director of the institute<br>for governance and policy studies for<br>enabling this event to take place<br>uh i'm jonathan boston i'm one of the<br>professors in the school of government<br>at um victoria university of wellington<br>and uh some years ago i used to run<br>the institute for governance and policy<br>studies and um<br>i'm i'm delighted that simon is in that<br>role now and uh<br>bearing that responsibility uh<br>the issues we're going to be discussing<br>are really important many of you will be<br>very familiar with them<br>the the process we're going to follow is<br>is<br>uh is as follows so there'll be three<br>presentations<br>starting with um professor janet<br>stevenson of otago university she's the<br>director of the center for<br>sustainability<br>janet will be followed by dr mike joy<br>who's<br>a senior researcher in the institute for<br>governance and policy studies<br>and an ecologist by training<br>with particular expertise on fresh water<br>issues and<br>mike will be followed by dr jeff bertram<br>who's the senior associate of the<br>institute for<br>governance and policy studies uh an<br>economist<br>and someone who has worked extensively<br>on a range of<br>environmental and energy related<br>economic issues over his lifetime<br>so we'll have these uh three<br>presentations i'll then give the<br>three presenters an opportunity to<br>interact and just to discuss some of the<br>matters that they've raised in their<br>presentations<br>and then i'll open up the webinar for<br>uh wider comment and contributions<br>now in that regard we might just start<br>using the chat<br>function initially and i'll come back<br>and explain that a bit more when we get<br>there<br>so if you want to ask a question early<br>on in the process<br>uh please start let us start with the<br>chat function<br>and and then after we dealt with some of<br>the questions on the chat function<br>i'll i'll invite you to um if you wish<br>uh to put your hand up uh using the<br>facility you have at the bottom of your<br>screen<br>and i will go to you um and<br>invite you to make an oral contribution<br>or respond<br>to something that has been said my my<br>hope is that we can work through some of<br>the issues<br>uh systematically um so that so that we<br>have a kind of<br>a thoughtful and<br>well systematic conversation rather than<br>a very bitsy conversation<br>there are a variety of important issues<br>and janet<br>mike and jeff will be highlighting those<br>in their presentations<br>just a few other matters before we get<br>underway um<br>this i hope will be the first of a<br>number of events um<br>on this topic area it's an immensely<br>important enriched topic area and needs<br>serious uh analysis and discussion so<br>the intention is that over the coming<br>year and beyond we the institute will<br>host<br>a series of webinars covering covering<br>uh<br>issues in this policy space<br>secondly this webinar is being recorded<br>and the intention is that this recording<br>will be made available through the<br>institute<br>to people who want to listen in the<br>future so please just bear that in mind<br>and i think that's probably all i need<br>to say at this point<br>so with that um just to say welcome<br>again to those who are attending this<br>webinar<br>uh we'll be running for almost two hours<br>uh obviously if you need to leave<br>you're welcome um and i'll start with<br>janice<br>uh and invite janet to kick off with her<br>presentation<br>thank you janet thank you i'm<br>going to share my screen um so that we<br>can<br>yeah right well kia ora koto<br>um so<br>i'm not an economist like jeff or a<br>biophysical scientist like like mike i'm<br>a social scientist and and as such i'm<br>really interested in how society<br>grapples with the transition to a<br>sustainable future and<br>really most of my my research life is is<br>focused on aspects of that question<br>so while i'm not an expert in economic<br>growth by any means i am very interested<br>in how and why this idea of economic<br>growth has become normalized in<br>governments businesses<br>and society generally normalized to the<br>extent that<br>to lack economic growth is<br>unquestionably seen as a failure<br>so i'm going to talk about how this<br>concept of growth has become so embedded<br>in today's thinking<br>and the biophysical and societal<br>consequences of this<br>but first what do we mean by economic<br>growth<br>and jonathan's invitation to contribute<br>to this panel he made it clear that by<br>economic growth he meant growing gdp<br>he referred to both total gdp and gdp<br>per capita<br>so that is the the definition that i'm<br>going to use<br>um and i'm putting an asterisk by that<br>to show that that<br>that is in fact what we're meaning by<br>growth in in these discussions today<br>but growing gdp is intimately associated<br>with growing production and consumption<br>and growing personal<br>and corporate wealth ultimately it is<br>about growing financial<br>flows through the economy when i talk<br>about growth today it is with this<br>meaning<br>so this again this asterisk is there<br>but let's sidestep briefly to a bathtub<br>bathtub<br>earth one way of thinking about<br>financial flows is the flow through of<br>real and imaginary money<br>in and out of the bathtub but this<br>concept is divorced from the idea of how<br>full the bathtub is it<br>stocks economic growth as measured by<br>gdp<br>doesn't take into account how the<br>activities producing the flow<br>may be depleting the biodiversity<br>damaging natural systems that support<br>human well-being<br>or creating inequities across current<br>and future<br>generations<br>this concept of stocks versus flows<br>becomes important when we ask the<br>question<br>are there biophysical limits to growth<br>i'm going to answer this by discussing<br>two types of biophysical limits what i<br>call consequential limits<br>to show what i mean by consequential<br>limits let's go back to around 200 years<br>ago to the era<br>of the industrial revolution two key<br>things were happening which start this<br>story<br>fossil fuels replaced labor powering<br>technologies and enabling huge<br>reductions in cost of production<br>and this together with colonization and<br>resource and human exploitation<br>gave seemingly limitless potential for<br>dramatic and ongoing growth in<br>production<br>consumption and personal wealth over<br>time this idea became normalized<br>growth is essential and inevitable there<br>are no physical limits<br>and any risks are acceptable or can be<br>dealt with by technology<br>and the growth paradigm has permeated<br>everything we do cities have to grow or<br>they're considered to be stagnant<br>businesses have to grow or their<br>failures families have to grow their<br>wealth and possessions<br>this has had many repercussions global<br>population increased and with this<br>together with ongoing growth led to more<br>resource use<br>and increasing waste to a scale that<br>started damaging<br>environmental systems the age of the<br>anthropocene<br>increasingly financial flows are<br>starting to have to be redirected<br>to fixing the resulting environmental<br>and social disasters<br>such as increasing hurricanes and floods<br>together these are leading to increasing<br>inequality and injustices in different<br>parts of the world<br>especially those that are already under<br>financial environmental and humanitarian<br>stress<br>and the normalization of growth<br>underpins the dominant economic thinking<br>and because it is a flow these impacts<br>on stocks can be ignored<br>we're now at a crux point where those<br>old uncertainties are unravelling we're<br>facing<br>global and local resource limits and<br>increasing societal<br>resistance to destructive resource<br>exploitation<br>we're starting the process of replacing<br>fossil fuels with renewable energy<br>and many natural resources are becoming<br>depleted or access<br>is contested at the other end of the<br>chain<br>climate change and other environmental<br>damages also starting to impact on gdp<br>looking to the future all of these have<br>disastrous health<br>i suggest that consequential limits to<br>growth following from this failing<br>system fall into three main categories<br>first of all limits to growth from the<br>reduced availability of resources<br>and and two examples there one in the<br>cervical paper that was shared about<br>about minerals<br>he points out that climate change<br>mitigation will require very large<br>amounts of relatively rare minerals but<br>they<br>are in limited supply but also<br>importantly in locations that are poorly<br>managed or sites of conflict<br>another brief example the food fao says<br>that by 2050<br>ongoing soil erosion the loss of another<br>resource may reduce cop<br>yields up to 10 percent which is the<br>equivalent of removing millions of<br>hectares of land<br>from crop production the second<br>consequential limit is limits to growth<br>from environmental degradation<br>and here an example or two insurance<br>firm swiss ray<br>report just out says that more than half<br>of global gdp<br>42 trillion dollars depends on high<br>functioning biodiversity<br>it says one-fifth of the world's<br>countries are at risk of the ecosystems<br>collapsing<br>because of the destruction of wildlife<br>and habitats and the risk of tipping<br>points is growing<br>and another recent study by the<br>economist suggests that the global<br>economy<br>will be three percent smaller in 2050<br>than today due to climate change<br>alone and then there's<br>limits to growth from increasing need<br>for investment in disaster recovery<br>rather than productivity a un report<br>from two days ago<br>says the first 20 years of the century<br>have seen a staggering rise in climate<br>disasters<br>with 2.97 trillion dollars in losses to<br>the global economy<br>these losses are unequally spread with<br>poorer nations<br>impacted the worst so all of these<br>consequential limits impact on the<br>briefly now i'm also going to talk about<br>essential limits<br>the idea of essential limits is best<br>shown by three diagrams<br>first of all the work on planetary<br>boundaries which shows that we're<br>already beyond the ability of some<br>natural systems<br>to maintain their functioning such as<br>biogeochemical flows<br>and genetic diversity and getting close<br>with land use change<br>and climate change secondly the work on<br>on ecological footprints which tells us<br>we're already consuming<br>1.7 times what global systems can<br>sustain<br>and that many nations are well beyond<br>that up to five globes equivalent for<br>example for the united states<br>and many are seriously under that<br>and the concept of donut economics which<br>brings together the idea of<br>ecological limits with the need to<br>ensure that everybody gets a fair share<br>to support social well-being<br>together these forms of analysis and<br>others like them are concluding<br>that to avoid destroying the natural<br>systems that we depend on<br>will require less consumption less<br>damaging production<br>less waste but less biophysical<br>destruction and less inequality<br>in fact less of everything that is a<br>and just as an interesting semi-aside<br>because i know mike is going to cover<br>this<br>fossil fuels are a particularly<br>interesting case as they are deeply<br>implicated in both consequential<br>and essential limits they're a primary<br>cause of the growth paradigm and the<br>primary cause of climate change<br>but to get out of jail we have to hand<br>in our prize card in the growth game<br>so to conclude are there biophysical<br>limits to growth<br>to me this question has two parts<br>firstly<br>are our increasingly distressed<br>biophysical<br>systems going to constrain the<br>possibility of continued<br>gdp growth and under business as usual<br>i think the answer is definitely yes<br>these are the consequential limits<br>the other part of the question is do we<br>need to shift from a growth focused<br>economy to achieve a planet that<br>supports long-term human well-being<br>again the answer is yes these are<br>essential limits<br>my conclusion is that there are<br>biophysical limits to growth<br>but can we imagine economy without<br>growth<br>growth as defined measured and aspired<br>after looks increasingly impossible<br>and increasingly undesirable to get to a<br>safe and just space for humanity as<br>raywood puts it requires first of all<br>for us to dismantle<br>a couple of centuries of mental<br>conditioning<br>this first step might be the hardest and<br>that is to even imagine<br>an economy where growth as in ever<br>increasing gdp<br>is not a fundamental expectation and to<br>start to consider<br>how such an economy might operate if we<br>can't get to imagining this<br>we're condemning our future generations<br>thank you very much indeed janet that<br>was an excellent overview<br>um and just to welcome any people who<br>have joined<br>and to note that after we've had a<br>chance for the<br>three presenters to present their<br>material<br>we'll have some interaction and then<br>we'll move to<br>a q a session for a period of time so if<br>you have specific questions<br>uh please feel free to begin to use the<br>q a<br>function so mike um it's your turn and<br>you'll need to unmute<br>alright okay great thanks um<br>and thanks janet that was fantastic i<br>think you know we've<br>i'm going to cover some of the things<br>that janet's talked about already but<br>really nice framing there i'm going to<br>stick to<br>science as a scientist and i'm not going<br>to talk about money i'm just going to<br>talk about<br>the the living and the non-living world<br>and the limits to growth that i see is<br>you know sort of the i guess the<br>culmination<br>oh i know that sounds like the end but<br>the build-up of a long time of looking<br>at impacts of fresh water and then<br>having to<br>see you know at the at the local stream<br>scale and then trying to figure out<br>what's going on<br>at the catchment scale and then the<br>country<br>scale and then inevitably i had to look<br>at the global scale to try and see what<br>was going on to understand the<br>destruction that i could see around me<br>and so that's kind of<br>how i've got into this looking much much<br>deeper into<br>um again i guess as an ecologist<br>uh my training my understanding of the<br>world is all about<br>interconnections and and systems and so<br>that's<br>kind of how i got to to here and and how<br>i'm here<br>talking about this stuff today so i'm<br>going to talk about some of the examples<br>first and<br>and sorry but and you know sort of<br>double up a little bit on janet but<br>i don't think it matters to keep hearing<br>this stuff um and i want to talk about<br>a lot of interactions the feedback<br>effects of declining<br>fossil energy and mineral concentrations<br>um the energy ecological and material<br>constraints<br>on transitioning away from fossil fuels<br>because there's some big problems coming<br>up there<br>just kind of a reality check on the<br>decarbonizing transition<br>and then um i i<br>so first just to kind of<br>the sort of thing doesn't seem to make<br>the mainstream media and i don't know<br>how many people are aware of it but<br>scientists i think are inherently very<br>conservative<br>and when you get this 20 000 when<br>this warning came out this is a<br>follow-up warning from a warning in the<br>70s from a<br>thousand science a few thousand<br>scientists it's now<br>well over twenty thousand scientists<br>just making this really really clear<br>that we're hitting limits on all kinds<br>of things and<br>that statement if the world doesn't act<br>soon there'll be catastrophic<br>biodiversity loss and untold amounts of<br>human misery<br>and and to have that message in one ear<br>and<br>and to listen to politicians and the<br>build-up to the election here and in<br>other parts of the world and just<br>no mention of this kind of reality it's<br>like there is two worlds that we live in<br>um the planetary boundary stuff of<br>course that<br>janet put this graph up but this this<br>little graph here also has<br>black dots on it and the black dots<br>animal agriculture's influence<br>on those exceedances so you can see how<br>much animal agriculture is<br>driving the the exceedances of the<br>planetary boundaries just to just to put<br>some of the<br>the reason behind it um the agriculture<br>aquaculture fishing and forestry so the<br>food productions<br>side of um of what we do on the planet<br>is just becoming more and more dependent<br>on fossil fuels or has become<br>and continues to become up to 62 percent<br>of that<br>food comes from fossil fuels now uh 68<br>percent of the earth's terrestrial<br>service is covered with that and 22<br>of our greenhouse gas emissions come<br>from that food production<br>and and so how that looks when you look<br>at the the vertebrate animals<br>on the planet for example only three<br>percent<br>of the vertebrate animals on the planet<br>now are wild animals the rest of the<br>animals are<br>humans and the animals that we eat and<br>have as pets<br>so you know no wonder we have a<br>biodiversity crisis like<br>never before just looking at that figure<br>alone<br>without even thinking about climate<br>change and and uh<br>you know anything that's coming in the<br>future that's how much we dominate the<br>planet<br>um and of course that that means that<br>you look at the the figures for<br>declines of animals and and<br>this is seen first in fresh water and<br>maybe that's why it's so<br>obvious to me um because it everything<br>sort of ends up first in fresh water<br>what<br>that we do on the land and we get<br>massive declines there in<br>new zealand as well um and of course<br>you know the human side of things uh<br>a very large proportion of the people on<br>the planet now<br>um have many ecological threats coming<br>at them<br>and and water being a big one of those<br>okay so now i want to i want to sort of<br>move on to these i think<br>i could probably explain everything i<br>want to talk about with these two<br>uh pyramids here so the first one is<br>the resource energy pyramid and<br>that's the idea of i mean there's<br>many ways of looking at this i think one<br>of the handier ones<br>is the energy return on energy invested<br>and this often gets mistaken for we talk<br>about eroi energy return on investment<br>and it's it's not fiscal financial it's<br>purely about energy<br>so just the reality that we we had<br>very easy oil i mean just off taranaki<br>it bubbled up out of the ground<br>we've gone from that to having to work<br>really really hard to get it so the low<br>hanging fruit had gone and now we're<br>having to put more and more<br>effort into getting the energy and so<br>you can see with those<br>what the effects on society with the two<br>graphics at the bottom there<br>and the and the simplest explanation is<br>that to get the same amount of energy<br>you need<br>more energy because you're putting more<br>energy back into getting the energy<br>and so that puts a squeeze on what's<br>available<br>for other things and you can see the<br>blue arrow there<br>the except the the green arrow the<br>essentials doesn't change of course but<br>the squeeze gets put on the<br>discretionary energy which i'm sure<br>the economist can can link to uh<br>discretionary money but i'll just stick<br>with discretionary energy and that's<br>discretionary energy to do things like<br>uh shifting to transitioning to<br>renewables<br>the and then there's the other resource<br>pyramid there the one<br>with the minerals so just the example<br>given<br>of copper there where the sort of<br>concentration of copper<br>in the material that you mine goes down<br>and down and down so you have to mine<br>more and more of that material<br>to get the same amount of copper out and<br>then so you have to put more and more<br>energy into that<br>so when you think about that energy<br>return on<br>investment um there's domestic oil so<br>this graph's got sort of the amount of<br>this energy<br>that's available on the x-axis and on<br>the y-axis<br>is the energy return on investment and<br>so we can see just oils being plotted<br>over time there from 1930s at about 100<br>to 100 units of energy to get one back<br>down into the 70s and it's around 30.<br>the bubbles are showing there's a fair<br>bit of variability there in the<br>calculations depending on where you're<br>drawing the barriers<br>the bubble going uh left to right is<br>showing that<br>you know the the sort of extent of what<br>we have available so the bubble's<br>getting smaller a bit for oil<br>but that the energy return from it is<br>getting less and less and less as we<br>have to put more<br>energy in to getting it<br>i think you know interestingly you can<br>see coal up there<br>a big reserve there quite a big<br>variability of course an<br>energy return because depending on if<br>it's shallow or deep<br>hydro quite high hydroelectricity and<br>biomass firewood there<br>coming down on that energy return wind<br>turbines<br>photovoltaic and right down there in the<br>very bottom left-hand corner<br>as you know the<br>manufactured fuels like bio biodiesel<br>and biofuels<br>that have a very low energy return on<br>investment and<br>very limited capability or extent of<br>that available<br>okay so um that's kind of trying to put<br>that<br>i don't want to end up and i don't want<br>to get don't think it's necessary to get<br>into arguments about the details<br>of how you measure energy return on<br>investment it's just a very simple<br>concept<br>there is arguments about where<br>boundaries are drawn and how you<br>calculate numbers for different systems<br>but it's just simply<br>the fact that as resources become more<br>depleted you have to put more and more<br>energy in to getting them<br>okay so this really noisy kind of graph<br>here is<br>me trying to explain how<br>everything that's coming up is going to<br>require more energy<br>so i'm going to sort of move around i<br>don't know if you can see my mouse or<br>not but there's<br>starting with oil up in the top<br>left-hand corner there we're just not<br>discovering it at anywhere near the rate<br>that we're using it<br>and there's there's many signs and i<br>don't want to get into an argument<br>because that but there is<br>or has been or very soon will be peak<br>oil<br>um we have fracking and other methods<br>but they have big problems with uh<br>with energy return on investment and the<br>harm that's being done from them<br>plus that resource pyramid there so the<br>energy return on<br>on on energy invested going down and and<br>so what it actually means is a net<br>decline<br>in fossil fuel energy available<br>um then so you have uh<br>that also the need for carbon zero so<br>with with climate change impacts coming<br>that we've talked about already we have<br>to reduce the amount of carbon that we<br>release to the atmosphere<br>so that means that we have to put more<br>and more energy<br>into the transition to renewables<br>as we transition to renewables we need<br>lots of energy<br>to do that um and and that just<br>kind of feeds back on itself the more we<br>do that the more energy<br>is required one of the mitigations<br>that's talked about a lot<br>and it's in the ipcc reports is carbon<br>sequestration<br>it is possible to sequester carbon i<br>have no doubt about that but<br>there is a huge energy cost in doing<br>that so<br>you know for example anything that i've<br>seen so far you're looking at around<br>40 percent of the energy that you get<br>from<br>the system have being lost and putting<br>it back putting the carbon into the<br>ground<br>so again that feeds into more energy<br>required<br>i mentioned before that we need to have<br>more um<br>food production uses more fossil fuels<br>so<br>we um we have to we have we need more<br>energy to get food the way we make it at<br>the moment<br>um and then there's the gadget side of<br>things and just the<br>stuff that we have um per capita energy<br>use<br>continues to grow it has not<br>it's sort of plateaued a couple of times<br>in history but we're still using<br>more energy per capita than ever before<br>more gadgets more things in our lives<br>that require<br>batteries i mean if you see the<br>incredible move towards<br>electric bicycles and scooters and<br>battery-powered tools that builders and<br>all kinds of trades people use all that<br>kind of thing just<br>more and more gadgets all requiring more<br>and more of those rear<br>minerals to drive them and i don't know<br>if you can make out the little graph up<br>in the top<br>right hand corner one's the increase in<br>energy consumption per capita<br>the other one that big expanding bars<br>are just the amount of material<br>that's mined on the planet to<br>to make all these gadgets and things<br>that the technology<br>that we're that we're using more and<br>more of<br>um and and i'm back on the left-hand<br>corner again that<br>more mining required to get those<br>minerals both because we need<br>more minerals for or for the replacing<br>of fossil fuels and all the new gadgets<br>but<br>also because we have to mine more to get<br>the same amount of material<br>um means more mining and more and<br>there's huge uh biodiversity and human<br>impacts<br>from that mining process so just<br>all of these things driving in one<br>direction and and that's the need for<br>more energy<br>which then has all these other feedback<br>loops<br>so just looking towards this idea of a<br>transition towards renewable energy<br>i've got this little graphic here that i<br>borrowed off um simon michaud who's<br>doing a lot of work in this here<br>an australian who's doing work for the<br>for the finnish government at the moment<br>and writing some amazing reports on on<br>this stuff where he really breaks this<br>this stuff down but we've kind of got um<br>economic kind of system in<br>in the in the center there the<br>industrial ecosystem being fed<br>and and the energy coming in at the top<br>there is the size of those boxes<br>is relative to the size of what's<br>feeding into our current energy system<br>at the moment<br>so coal hydro nuclear wind and solar<br>going into the<br>electricity part of it and gas and oil<br>onto the the other energy part of it<br>they're all energy but we need to be<br>careful to understand the difference<br>between the two currently<br>globally electricity is only 20 of<br>our energy use the the rest of it is<br>uh heat energy and used for all kinds of<br>uh making of plastics and building roads<br>and all that kind of thing that's on<br>there<br>so so the future is we're gonna have to<br>knock out these three things<br>and very quickly to have a hope of<br>surviving<br>so that leaves the hydronuclear wind and<br>solar<br>as the technologies that we know of at<br>the moment that we're going to have to<br>ramp up feeding into that system<br>okay i just wanted to touch on a few of<br>those things that hydro<br>has a good energy return on investment<br>but we've damned most of the rivers that<br>can be damned<br>there are huge biological and physical<br>impacts<br>so geomorphological and biological<br>impacts of dams and<br>dams are temporary um i can give you an<br>example of one in new zealand that i've<br>done a lot of work on<br>that in the the party damn that will not<br>be a dam in another 30 years<br>in the first 30 years of its life it<br>lost half of its capacity<br>through sedimentation and another 30<br>years it won't be a dam<br>anymore that's the reality of dams is<br>that they stop sediment movement and so<br>they build up<br>nuclear um<br>we've got lots of issues with nuclear um<br>it's very slow to build it<br>it's very expensive um there are many<br>unsolved waste issues with that but<br>that's<br>that's another option that we have we've<br>got wind<br>big installation environmental uh<br>material footprint<br>for wind and and it's intermittent so<br>we've got problems with the with it not<br>being regular<br>not being constant and the same with<br>solar um but<br>maybe not so big on the on the problems<br>of of implementing<br>it but um down the bottom that<br>the graph that it's all that's feeding<br>up to on the bottom i i've<br>got a zoom of and of that it's again<br>it's misho's work but it's basically a<br>whole bunch of minerals there<br>and their availability and he's done the<br>work if you look on that graph at the<br>bottom<br>if if we were he calculated to replace<br>all of the transport needs for fossil<br>fuels on the planet so that includes<br>ships<br>he didn't put in uh aviation because<br>it's just not possible<br>at the moment to come up with any kind<br>of alternative to<br>fossil fuels for aviation so he left<br>that out but this is shipping and rail<br>and road and<br>in cars for transport and and the global<br>reserves are the bars in blue<br>and the the metals needed to to build<br>the<br>88 863 million tons of lithium-ion<br>batteries which is what he calculated we<br>would need to replace those fossil fuels<br>for transportation and you can see<br>you know in these many examples of this<br>of just<br>just not being with the technology that<br>we have currently<br>the available materials minerals on the<br>planet to be able to make that<br>transition<br>and to put it he he's a geologist and he<br>to put it into sort of<br>reality um you know basically roughly<br>seven times the cobalt lithium and<br>nickel deposits that are known<br>resources of for those things at the<br>moment would have to be seven more of<br>each one of those things to be able to<br>achieve that with lithium ion batteries<br>um just to put that so so what is what<br>is<br>driving towards or those things that i'm<br>talking about those limitations<br>with the with the energy return on<br>investment of<br>fossil fuels declining is this idea of a<br>seneca cliff or sort of upside down<br>version of it here but just the basic<br>message from this is that<br>as we trans<br>transition to fuels with lower<br>energy return on investment you get this<br>quite sudden change<br>it seems like nothing much is changing<br>over time and then<br>suddenly it suddenly gets very very<br>difficult<br>um to and this is this idea that you<br>need an energy return on investment of<br>around ten<br>to one as the lowest minimum to maintain<br>industrial civilization and there's a<br>few papers being done on that but<br>just just wanted to get across the idea<br>that it seems like nothing much is<br>happening for a long time and then it's<br>very sudden<br>when the when the when the change starts<br>to come<br>i guess another way i like this way of<br>thinking as a way to explain it a very<br>simple sort of<br>one that rolls off the tongue for the<br>reality of the change that's needed<br>to replace fossil fuels so in 2018<br>the world consumed over 11 000 megatons<br>of oil equivalent<br>in fossil fuels so that's gas and oil to<br>reach net zero by 2050<br>we've about 11 000 days till then just<br>to<br>to round things out um so we need to<br>reduce by one<br>megaton of oil equivalent every day from<br>now until 2050.<br>um and and likely we don't have the 2050<br>plenty of studies<br>saying that it's more like 2035 we have<br>to have it done by<br>so what that works out to is just to<br>give you an idea of the<br>extent of the of the required you know<br>sort of transition<br>that's 1500 large wind turbines<br>every day and by the way that covers 770<br>odd<br>square kilometers every day from now to<br>2050<br>or maybe we could do that one day and on<br>the next day we build a large nuclear<br>power plant every every other day<br>um just to put that into context there<br>are 430 nuclear power plants on the<br>planet at the moment so<br>one a day that's that's just to give you<br>an idea that's<br>not counting all of the material<br>that you would have to mine you know i<br>mean you got it to build all that to get<br>the copper to connect it all up<br>to do all those things just<br>trying to get across the reality that<br>there's no way<br>that we are going to transition into a<br>world of similar energy use or more<br>energy use<br>than we have at the moment with with any<br>of the current technologies<br>and and i'd still even preface that even<br>were some other technologies to come<br>along the the time the scaling up you<br>know thinking that we've had<br>a hundred years to build up the<br>infrastructure that we have at the<br>moment<br>for more than 100 years but you know<br>that that we we just don't have the time<br>to be able to make these kind of changes<br>so just to sum up then we've already<br>reached and surpassed many<br>critical biophysical limits um<br>there are all kinds of feedback effects<br>and interactions between client<br>declining net fossil fuel<br>declining mineral concentrations<br>and and what it means is we'll have less<br>energy available there'll be less energy<br>for society in the future<br>and increasing biological impacts um<br>and and just the just the simple um<br>material constraints of transition means<br>very unlikely we can make it with known<br>technology<br>so we have to face of the fact and i<br>think plan for a future<br>with way less energy and the emphasis to<br>my mind should be going on conserving<br>energy on for example building houses<br>that don't require as much energy<br>you know concentrating on transport<br>systems that that<br>you know require less material so<br>completely<br>not thinking electric vehicles or<br>anything that's going to happen along<br>those lines but<br>but much more radical thinking than that<br>to have to have a hope<br>of a future that's livable<br>um and yeah and you know there's lots<br>more we can talk about and hope we'll<br>hopefully we'll we'll get to discuss<br>some of those things today but<br>um that's pretty much it for me thanks<br>well thank you very much mike that was a<br>very comprehensive overview<br>i'll turn now to jeff um jeff has<br>already uh<br>distributed and i hope you those who are<br>attending this webinar have seen his<br>note<br>but jeff is going to talk to his nose<br>and perhaps jeff you might want to<br>respond to some of the things that janet<br>and michael said and then i'll give mike<br>and janet a chance to<br>to respond as well thank you sure if you<br>better pull me up if i go beyond about<br>seven or eight minutes for jonathan<br>otherwise i'll talk all morning<br>and all right now<br>i'm the economist here uh<br>and it's really quite in in a sense<br>it's a nice change to not to be the<br>dismal voice in the room economics used<br>to be called the dismal science<br>and that was for a good reason that was<br>that<br>for a long long time economics kept on<br>making the sort of<br>statements that mike has been making<br>about the future for humanity<br>it's now two centuries since david<br>ricardo predicted that<br>capitalism would have to come to a<br>grinding halt<br>because of the scarcity of land and if<br>you look at the<br>the actual grinding halt that he thought<br>would come<br>it was a grinding halt with extreme<br>inequality well i'd like to start by<br>making that point i think<br>um when when you make aspirational<br>statements about how we might be able to<br>rescue something out of this catastrophe<br>and link that to the idea that it can be<br>an egalitarian outcome<br>i i think that's that's something that<br>you can hope desperately for<br>but there's a lot of economic analysis<br>that points in a different direction and<br>ricardo is one of those ricardo's<br>view of the future for capitalism with<br>fixed land uh<br>no technological progress or in mike's<br>terms it would be no technological<br>progress sufficient to overcome<br>the shortage of natural resources uh<br>ricardo says okay those who<br>have ownership of the scarce and<br>declining natural resources<br>get an increasing share of the product<br>because they're able to collect rent on<br>the<br>scarcity value of those resources the<br>rest of the population<br>the workers are reduced to subsistence<br>wages where they where they stay forever<br>um and the capitalists are reduced to<br>zero profit where they stay forever and<br>the stationary state is one where<br>the system simply reproduces itself um<br>effectively becoming feudal again in<br>other words<br>if you think about the social structure<br>that goes with ricardo's<br>vision of a stationary state it's a<br>feudal one with a with a land<br>owning elite or in the 21st century<br>context<br>a natural resource owning a lead<br>collecting the greatest share of the<br>product<br>and the rest of the population on<br>subsistence whatever they can scrounge<br>and so and then if you're thinking about<br>the the future that mike<br>implicitly is sketching out uh it's it's<br>a future in which<br>uh riccardian checks and balances come<br>to play for the great majority of<br>humanity<br>who live in a very in at a level of life<br>that can be sustained with non-fossil<br>energy<br>uh basically human and animal energy<br>that means plus whatever you can<br>maybe harvest from wind and solar but<br>if mike is right about the diminishing<br>returns<br>that apply to producing wind and solar<br>then you<br>uh have again to think about quite low<br>levels<br>of energy consumption so it's a high the<br>ricardian<br>outlook is a highly unegalitarian one<br>and a stationary state where capitalism<br>has to cease to be<br>that's 200 years ago and a lot of<br>economists signed up to the ricardian<br>vision diminishing returns remain<br>central to the economic<br>uh view of the world and yet two<br>centuries on<br>uh there are very few people in<br>economics<br>who any longer adhere to that ricardian<br>vision even though<br>mike's vision of the the coming into the<br>world<br>is compelling grounded and good science<br>plenty of solid numbers there and yet<br>economists<br>on mess just don't look into that<br>they're not flocking to it because<br>the the professions experience<br>was this was in the 19th century to<br>essentially say the end of the world is<br>nigh and to set out reasons why it is<br>nigh<br>and to forecast various outcomes from<br>the coming crises<br>and then the 20th century was a century<br>where those crises went away<br>and the profession as a result got less<br>and less dismal and more and more<br>persuaded that<br>our visions of doom haven't stacked up<br>so<br>maybe other people's visions of doom<br>won't stack up either<br>and so now you have a problem that the<br>the entire intellectual culture and<br>economics<br>has moved from technological pessimism<br>to technological<br>hyper-optimism um and<br>economists are therefore very difficult<br>now to persuade that the end of the<br>world is really nigh<br>because because of a century of<br>empirical observation of the end of the<br>world getting deferred<br>over and over and over and over and over<br>again by<br>unexpected unforeseen<br>things that happened so<br>i want to start with you know what seems<br>to me a basic truth<br>if something can't go on forever it'll<br>stop<br>in other words an unsustainable path<br>cannot be sustained<br>all right so<br>the really crucial question over and<br>over and over and over again is if<br>you're on an unsustainable path<br>where does it stop how does it stop and<br>what comes after the<br>stop it and um there are essentially two<br>things it seems to me that<br>can happen at the end of an<br>unsustainable path<br>one is collapse and jared diamond has<br>written a large book studying various<br>systems where the human failure to adapt<br>to<br>real constraints that they faced<br>produced<br>a crisis in the collapse<br>so yes there's plenty of historical<br>cases where we've done that and it may<br>well be that on a global scale we're<br>about to do it again<br>um i can't argue against the scientific<br>stuff that<br>and the engineering stuff that mike has<br>to offer it all looks compelling<br>um so that's uh that's one thing that<br>can<br>that one way you can you can end you can<br>end and collapse<br>and we can talk a little bit about what<br>happens after the collapse<br>the other thing that can happen as you<br>adapt<br>and the adapted system is one which<br>explicitly works within<br>the limits that is given and<br>mike sketched out a couple of ways in<br>which you might start thinking about<br>that<br>it requires an intensely planned<br>approach to the management of resources<br>and maintaining that intensely planned<br>approach and enforcing the constraints<br>that have to be observed<br>is not a trivial exercise and it's not<br>clear<br>that it is compatible with democratic<br>political processes as we know them<br>there is i suspect uh quite a lot of<br>human history that suggests that<br>unless we get a platonic philosopher<br>king to run the show<br>um it's going to be politically quite<br>repressive<br>relying on a dominant elite to enforce<br>its dictates relating to the uh<br>observation of limits now in terms of<br>how you might think about that let me<br>just offer you one<br>um before european contact in the<br>pacific islands<br>there were very clear limits to the<br>population expansion of the islander<br>population<br>and the pacific islands were colonized<br>over a long period of time by migrations<br>which moved in waves out to island after<br>island after ireland<br>and as the population on each settled<br>island reached the limits<br>that that island could support there<br>were two processes<br>that over and over and over again came<br>into play<br>one onward migration a bunch of folk get<br>on a canoe and go<br>looking for another island and that's<br>the expanding frontier<br>way out and the other one population<br>control<br>very largely by infanticide by the way<br>because the technology<br>for birth control was was not<br>particularly well developed in<br>in pre-european contact polynesia but<br>infanticide was<br>was a clear cut very efficient and<br>socially accepted and socially enforced<br>way of holding population within<br>biophysical limits so we know that human<br>societies have done that adaption<br>in in various situations and we know<br>human societies have done collapse<br>in various situations we need to ask<br>ourselves for the global<br>community in the 21st century one<br>are we really up against it okay<br>and i'm have an open mind on that still<br>two if we are up against that if mike is<br>right<br>uh is it uh uh is it crash and burn<br>or is it step back to a way of running<br>our human community on this planet<br>within those physical limits<br>with the costs that that entails in<br>terms of<br>domination of some political authority<br>that can<br>enforce behavior within the limits and<br>potentially highly unequal access to<br>resources in other words the<br>systematic exclusion of the great mass<br>of the human population from access to<br>the standards of living and well-being<br>that rest upon<br>access to the increasingly scarce<br>resources<br>now this means economics it seems to me<br>once we start engaging seriously with<br>the questions that are being put up here<br>becomes again a very dismal science<br>um so i do the three points that i'd<br>put on my notes first<br>the first one is we as economists<br>came to this particular issue two<br>centuries ago<br>and worked on how the thing could<br>end and came up with stories the<br>ricardian story of a highly unequal<br>essentially static<br>feudal system in which a a resource<br>owning a elite commands<br>the great share the greatest share of<br>the product and the standard of living<br>and the rest of the population goes to<br>subsistence<br>with malthusian checks and balances to<br>limit population<br>the marxian marx's vision of a<br>capitalism which<br>was inherently unstable and unable to<br>survive<br>in the absence of growth and in the<br>pursuit of growth and profit inevitably<br>created<br>so much inequality that it became<br>unsustainable politically and socially<br>and collapsed in a revolutionary<br>conjunction<br>and after the revolution marx was a high<br>with a technological optimist by the way<br>the forces of production and marks go<br>inextricably forward always so there is<br>always<br>in marks the technological solutions<br>just to get to it you have to overthrow<br>capitalism<br>and then there's not john stuart mill<br>who has what i think janet is talking<br>about<br>a stationary state where capitalism<br>settles<br>at a high level of living into a<br>civilized reasonably egalitarian<br>world where people have spare time and<br>leisure to cultivate the arts<br>and to and deliver civilized existence<br>and<br>john stuart mill's vision reappears in<br>walt rosters<br>stages of growth theory where after a<br>steep<br>rise from takeoff and drive to maturity<br>you reach<br>what is in rostow essentially a<br>stationary state which is american<br>consumerism<br>as of about 1955. um<br>everybody comfortable and nuclear<br>families living in houses with two cars<br>on the garage and so on<br>so first point is we have been here and<br>economists have spent a lot of time<br>thinking through what the post<br>the post-crisis economy would look like<br>whether it could be a capitalist economy<br>whether it could be a socialist economy<br>whether it could be a feudal economy how<br>egalitarian it might be<br>how much population it could sustain at<br>what level it can sustain that<br>population<br>and and after all those two centuries<br>are chewing on this<br>uh i don't have an answer for you now<br>that's that that's that's the first two<br>points really that i made in my thing<br>and the third point says that doesn't<br>mean economists are denying<br>uh all of these processes so a lot of<br>them are<br>typically your any economist that you<br>get on the<br>regular radio to comment on this sort of<br>stuff will say oh<br>technological progress will see us<br>through it's all right we'll find a way<br>um in other words there's a high degree<br>of what i think is probably unwarranted<br>optimism<br>is dragged out by economists but<br>remember that we are<br>apologists for the bourgeoisie and the<br>bourgeoisie doesn't like to<br>professionally economists have a strong<br>incentive to<br>offer you substitutability uh<br>technological progress<br>human adaptability as our answers to<br>what otherwise looks like a terrifyingly<br>uh end of the world<br>sort of outcome and so<br>just two things i wanted to say before i<br>knock off because i've been talking too<br>long now as i tend to<br>um the first one is about<br>janet's point about growth um<br>and gdp now a lot of non-economists have<br>a<br>have an unduly solid vision of what gdp<br>has<br>to be but gdp<br>is a money magnitude and money is a<br>terrifically fluid thing<br>and so if indeed<br>20 years from now the main activity in<br>which the human race is engaged is<br>saving the planet in order for us to<br>survive<br>that will be gdp there will be vast<br>amounts of<br>money and human time and thinking<br>and technology being devoted to the time<br>the task<br>of saving the planet uh<br>that doesn't mean growth will stop at<br>all i mean in gdp terms growth will be<br>rocketing up<br>vast amounts will be being spent uh on<br>on this project<br>uh in terms of the sort of things that<br>that mike is talking about you know<br>actually maintaining<br>um ecological systems and so on<br>um the the<br>there's a huge amount of human endeavour<br>can go into that and can be valued for<br>going into that<br>and can therefore count as gdp so growth<br>could be<br>20 years from now completely aimed in a<br>different direction<br>and be completely different from what<br>you think of as growth today<br>and that's why money is such a very very<br>dangerous thing too<br>to try to use as a a thing that into<br>which you convert<br>physical magnitudes and this is this is<br>the adaptability of capitalism i guess<br>that i'm that i'm referring to so<br>and the other thing that i wanted to to<br>comment on<br>um is the the difficulty of holding two<br>things in your mind at the same time<br>which don't fit together well on the one<br>hand<br>and the international agencies are<br>guilty of doing this a great deal the<br>united nations<br>uh latest report on the catastrophe in<br>front of us for example is<br>is a good case in point on the one hand<br>yes the disaster is here mike is correct<br>the world is facing a catastrophe<br>brought on by putting too much pressure<br>against the biophysical limits that we<br>confront<br>and over here there is technological<br>optimism but it is still<br>feasible to get out of this<br>and so so long as you've got those two<br>things the end of the world is nigh but<br>we can get out of it<br>it produces a political paralysis in a<br>way<br>um because the imperative to act<br>rests upon the idea that it's feasible<br>to act<br>and yet it's increasingly hard to be<br>optimistic about the feasibility of<br>acting<br>but if you can't believe in the<br>feasibility of getting out of this then<br>your incentive to do something about it<br>sort of fades away and you will tend to<br>live in the present only and<br>try to ignore the future things that we<br>cannot imagine<br>overcoming um psychologically are very<br>difficult to engage with<br>and so i think the challenge for people<br>for mike<br>and and and and indeed for you know the<br>donut economics people the circular<br>economy people<br>is to<br>find a way out of that psychological<br>impossibility position<br>it's not it's not enough just to be able<br>to say look we have the technological<br>ability to get out of this uh you have<br>to and i think jonathan is going to come<br>back at this<br>you have to see the mechanisms by which<br>we would actually implement those<br>possibilities<br>right right jeff okay thank you<br>that was a long seven minutes but uh<br>some good stuff important stuff<br>so um thank you all three i just like to<br>give janet and mike<br>perhaps an opportunity to respond to<br>jeff or to make any other additional<br>comments<br>and we'll then go to uh the comments<br>that are coming through in the in the<br>chat session people can use the q and a<br>facility um uh if you wish<br>and then after perhaps say 15 minutes or<br>so i'll give people the opportunity to<br>use the hand function and then i can<br>click on to the person who's put their<br>hand up and<br>you can you can speak uh make a comment<br>or<br>or pose a question but let's just start<br>with some responses janet and mike if<br>you could unmute<br>and uh janet would you like to go first<br>yeah um and thank you both mike and jeff<br>for really<br>stimulating ideas and um and uh<br>jeff i'd i'd like to to actually start<br>by asking asking you a question<br>and it's really about the minds of of<br>economists globally<br>um clearly um you're suggesting that<br>there is a lot of um<br>sort of current pushback on accepting<br>the idea that there might be<br>be problems that are questioning some<br>some fundamental<br>um expectations about about growth or<br>the<br>yeah it's kind of a two-part question if<br>if if we are if we are facing a future<br>in which in which economists think that<br>there<br>there may be some changes coming up but<br>they're they're not sure<br>but if the scale of these changes is is<br>so<br>potentially huge that it could really<br>have<br>enormous impacts on on human society<br>why would they not be grappling with<br>that issue<br>in a very fundamental way<br>and and don't forget to unmute um and<br>and um if they if they are not or if<br>they<br>are i would be interested in in maybe<br>you talking a little bit about<br>what are the who who are the economists<br>on the edge who are really pushing<br>ideas in a different direction um<br>and what are some of those ideas not in<br>it not in a long way but just just to<br>introduce those ideas<br>to the audience i mean i've read a<br>little of this but but it would be good<br>to get some<br>some um feedback from you on that<br>so janet that was to jeff yes it was yes<br>all right so jeff would you like to<br>respond<br>there there's not there are not many<br>economists<br>going down the paths that i was<br>sketching there are a lot of economists<br>who are trying to frame the optimistic<br>yes it is technologically feasible yes<br>here is how we would do it<br>and um you know the view you you listed<br>some of them the kate roberts of the<br>world<br>uh who say yes here is how it can be<br>done<br>whether in fact um they any any<br>of them uh first<br>have solutions that are technically<br>feasible within the limits<br>i think mike might be pessimistic about<br>that and b<br>whether they can point you towards how<br>to actually make those possibilities<br>actual<br>now simon chapel's got a question that<br>he put up about the incentives it's all<br>a matter of prices he said if you get<br>the prices right<br>um capitalist economies will respond to<br>prices and i<br>i think there's a lot going for that i<br>think that 30 years ago if we had put<br>serious prices on carbon uh and really<br>given strong incentives for the<br>capitalist economy to adjust to a new<br>set of relative prices we would today be<br>in a much better position to address<br>what's coming<br>i think having thrown away a whole<br>generation<br>of opportunities to use the price<br>mechanism to move the system forward<br>an increasing number i suspect of<br>economists are now looking at<br>physical limitation mechanisms quotas<br>rationing and so on enforced by central<br>dictate<br>so that the economy the economy rather<br>than responding to<br>price signals it has to create its own<br>price signals in order to<br>confront imposed barriers and examples<br>of the sort of thing that<br>i'm talking about a ban on all internal<br>combustion vehicles<br>on our roads and full stop<br>you know basically you declare the<br>existing vehicle fleet obsolete<br>let people scavenge it for whatever<br>useful bits they can get from it<br>but you stop entirely the use of fossil<br>fuels for personal transport<br>um a ban on nitrate fertilizers one for<br>mike<br>a ban on basically as you start<br>making explicit political constraints to<br>which the market has to adjust<br>the market will indeed adjust and indeed<br>a lot of people will make profits<br>adjusting and a huge amount of people<br>will scream blue murder<br>about the the expropriation of wealth<br>that is involved in the imposition of<br>limits but it seems to me we're now in a<br>position where that is<br>where the interesting uh economic work<br>is to be done it is and<br>how the price system responds to the<br>imposition of limits and you can do<br>general equilibrium modeling on this in<br>which you<br>simply tell the model that there is the<br>limit and the model will go off and<br>recalculate prices until it has managed<br>to reconcile the resulting stresses<br>thank you jeff i mean just can i just<br>add a comment that uh and there's others<br>uh who are listening into this who know<br>more about this than i but<br>there are journals like the journal of<br>ecological economics where there's a<br>whole group of people<br>uh you know highly trained economists<br>working on um<br>and economics that takes uh<br>biophysical limits very seriously and<br>and is thinking about the various issues<br>jeff you and janet and mike have raised<br>substitutability adaptability<br>you know technological um progress and<br>the limits to that and so on and so on<br>uh mike did you have a comment or<br>question either for janet or<br>jeff and um if so please far away<br>yeah um just to jeff thanks very much<br>for that<br>explanation it's kind of like a cry wolf<br>story and um<br>and and ricardo starting with ricardo<br>but i guess that i mean i'm not sure of<br>the exact timing of this but<br>as far as i can tell you know all of<br>these things when people got it wrong<br>it was because we just kept finding more<br>and more<br>well we kept being able to use more and<br>more fossil fuels all of this growth has<br>been driven by fossil fuels<br>so i think that the the the cry wolf<br>story<br>ends when when we don't have fossil<br>fuels to enable that that's just<br>you know my little little take on that<br>and i was interested in your<br>i think we see you know the the the<br>um the disaster is here versus the<br>techno optimism<br>um that you that you described and i<br>totally see how that puts<br>you know political parties and politics<br>into this really<br>space where they can't really move<br>because they're stuck between those two<br>things<br>um to me the techno optimism<br>is is the most dangerous thing<br>because it it means that because most<br>the people i<br>speak to on the street they don't think<br>we have to do anything because<br>the because the um we're just going to<br>transition to renewables they hit that<br>you know<br>daily i've got a news feed that bring<br>that comes out with<br>a headline or of five a day<br>you know things like you know lemon<br>peels you can make electricity from<br>lemon peels we'll be able to<br>power the world with lemons and idiotic<br>things like that that are very very<br>people want to hear them i i totally get<br>that they want to hear they want this<br>magic<br>and they want to believe that it's<br>available and there are there are a<br>huge number of people who are going to<br>profit from coming up with these stories<br>the whole green hydrogen is the latest<br>one that's just a complete scam that<br>everybody<br>is is jumping in on and investing in or<br>i think people are chasing investment so<br>this sort of i think you saw the<br>disaster is here as being<br>a problem for leading to disengagement<br>and<br>and i see the techno optimism is leading<br>to disengagement but<br>it's probably a bit of both in those two<br>things there but<br>um yeah but but anyway thanks very much<br>for that<br>for that explanation about um<br>the the sort of economist view of the<br>jeff did you want to comment or should<br>we go to the questions<br>in chat session now go on to the<br>questions jonathan because this is<br>all right there's things coming up on<br>the chat that are worth looking yes<br>so there's quite a few comments on the<br>chat and uh there's a number of people<br>also putting their hands up but let me<br>just go to the chat<br>first um so uh we probably won't get to<br>go through everything but<br>um question from robert mclaughlin janet<br>i don't know if you can see that<br>uh janet the question is some say the<br>rising inequality in justice is related<br>to globalization<br>global capitalism and finance etc but<br>maybe globalization is a consequence of<br>biophysical limits<br>so can you xenon make moves towards<br>sustainability without also moving<br>against<br>globalization uh and then there's a<br>question<br>here also from mike from robert when<br>energy was cheap<br>and the energy return on energy invested<br>was<br>was high a lot of energy was wasted we<br>still waste a lot of energy in cars some<br>people call<br>flying to bali and et cetera a waste<br>is pricing energy and regulating it its<br>use a component of the way forward in<br>other words<br>i presume part of the solution<br>potentially<br>might be a much more efficient use of<br>energy<br>so we don't need as much energy if we<br>have energy-efficient buildings for<br>example that need very little energy<br>well then<br>the constraint is somewhat reduced<br>because we simply don't need as much<br>so janet do you want to comment or jeff<br>on the<br>first part and then mike on the second<br>part<br>um well my response to the first<br>question<br>is i mean he's roberts look robert's<br>saying maybe globalization is a<br>consequence of<br>biophysical limits i think i think<br>globalization is actually a consequence<br>of<br>a belief that there are no biophysical<br>limits um<br>and and and hence we we have um<br>the the issues that we have today but i<br>think the move<br>um talking about moving against<br>globalization i think<br>it's it's very interesting that that the<br>covet experience has actually triggered<br>a quite different way of thinking about<br>about global systems<br>and and localization i think<br>globally and certainly in new zealand um<br>there's a much greater awareness of<br>the the dangers of being so dependent on<br>global supply chains which can<br>break down um global markets um the the<br>global throat flow through of of<br>tourists<br>etc um are now um seen as<br>as more risky i think than they were<br>before and i think i think that kind of<br>flick and understanding is is going to<br>have quite strong ripples from from here<br>out<br>and and certainly a lot of conversations<br>i've seen have been about how do we<br>become more localized<br>more more resilient at a local scale<br>um both within national boundaries and<br>also within regional and<br>local boundaries so and i think those<br>those ways of thinking actually are<br>are useful because in terms of this<br>bigger picture that we're talking about<br>they enable people to grapple more<br>closely with their local environments<br>and with the relationship<br>with the the quality of those local<br>environments i would i would hope at<br>least<br>thanks janet jeff i mean robert's point<br>is do you have to turn away from<br>globalization<br>and i i think i'd make the point that<br>if if you apply the ricardian story i<br>was talking about before<br>uh on a global scale and ask<br>suppose we move to a essentially a<br>neo-funeral world<br>where a small elite continue to enjoy<br>high levels of well-being and the great<br>massive humanity output<br>at a much lower standard of living<br>new zealand probably is almost entirely<br>within the global elite<br>uh the the inequality that<br>that i was talking about would be more<br>an inequality between<br>new zealand as the uh as the renewable<br>energy-based island and the rest of the<br>world in a sense<br>um and so when you talk about cutting us<br>off from the glo<br>from globalization it's really a matter<br>of insulating uh our little particular<br>bit of the global elite<br>from the wider consequences of the<br>biophysical limits being hit elsewhere<br>in the world where they don't have<br>lots of hydro electricity where they<br>don't have<br>as much wind blowing past and so on<br>and so uh it's real it's really<br>it's it's really important to frame in<br>your mind uh whether<br>you know the the the long run outcome<br>for new zealand<br>is to be protecting our own little patch<br>of relatively<br>affluent ongoing survival<br>in a much wider world where other forces<br>will be at work<br>and we're we're pretty small relative to<br>that wider world you've just got to hope<br>that it's a wider world where the rest<br>of humanity takes its fate lying down<br>rather than<br>well thanks jeff i mean just a comment<br>from me would be to say we<br>in in a globalized world that we're in<br>there there are enormous<br>interdependencies<br>as mike was referring to in his<br>presentation<br>and hence uh you know splendid isolation<br>becomes<br>uh impossible um<br>and covert has highlighted that as janet<br>has mentioned mike uh<br>a comment from you on that uh<br>energy return on energy invested point<br>yeah no i would not i just think that<br>it's it's<br>we did waste and we are still wasting a<br>huge amount of energy of such a an<br>incredible resource that we won't be<br>able to use much longer so<br>you know if i was had could could have<br>if i could control it would just<br>completely<br>divert all fossil fuel energy from this<br>day onwards<br>to transitioning to making our you know<br>making<br>buildings and everything else that are<br>much more energy efficient<br>and um you know just there's no way<br>we've got to get energy out of food<br>production<br>and energy out of life in general and<br>everything we do so<br>so no more cruise ships no more jet<br>airliners and stupid holidays just for<br>the sake of it<br>it would have to be all put into<br>the possibility of of transitioning you<br>know<br>to a to a sustainable energy sustainable<br>future<br>well mike just on that the next question<br>actually is<br>is very relevant actually uh it's from<br>murray<br>grimwood and it's about what will my<br>money be spent on<br>if there is less being done by less<br>energy<br>doing less work and so on is it is it<br>going to mean a percentage is<br>a percentage is spent virtually and as<br>you were saying no more<br>cruise ships no more flying uh etc i was<br>reminded of<br>the fact that we now have these virtual<br>uh plane trips<br>uh that various companies have organized<br>so you just get on a<br>mock plane and you go somewhere uh for<br>your plane trip<br>uh and you see all sorts of fantastic<br>scenery but you don't actually leave the<br>ground<br>so um uh so do you want to comment on<br>that mike<br>yeah yeah just quickly i i i did because<br>i had a really interesting conversation<br>with richard taylor the other night the<br>wetter<br>guy he gave a presentation to a group<br>that i was at about<br>the future about he sees the future for<br>new zealand very much and<br>you're part of the future being that um<br>the arts and the production of films and<br>all kinds of things and telling the new<br>zealand story and<br>you know a product that that doesn't<br>need an<br>aircraft to fly it or anything like that<br>you know it's just this amazing<br>electronic thing that's worth lots and<br>lots of money and you share it through<br>through this magic web thing and that<br>the only thing that we did<br>the the only caution with that is<br>this virtual world requires energy it<br>doesn't come energy free it's<br>massively energy intention intensive<br>those huge server farms the more and<br>more<br>data that we have in this uh you know uh<br>virtual<br>space wherever we collect it the the<br>and all the devices that we have to to<br>to share it and to watch it have a huge<br>footprint as well and so there is a<br>there is a limit to that<br>sure though i imagine flying virtually<br>yes yes<br>less carbon intensive than you're flying<br>for real um<br>all right now there's a few more<br>questions and there's a number of hands<br>uh simon you've made a comment here and<br>since you<br>actually uh part of the the hosting of<br>this<br>simon did you want to unmute yourself<br>and make a comment<br>um because you're welcome if you wish<br>no i'm good with the question um all i<br>will say about the question is<br>it's not simply about relative prices as<br>a solution<br>it's it's it's an issue of dealing<br>with vested interests whose<br>uh profits are determined by maintenance<br>of<br>status quo and how you deal with<br>those um the political economy of those<br>actors<br>yes so does anybody want to comment on<br>that uh the<br>the politics of this are as dismal if<br>you like as the<br>yeah well i'm i'm happy to agree with<br>simon<br>the modern democracy<br>is not at this point in time good at<br>dealing<br>with large vested interests um<br>but i think there's a growing awareness<br>that<br>we are going to have to deal with those<br>vested interests<br>and there's a whole series of fronts on<br>which confronting<br>large corporate organized lobbying power<br>is getting talked about antitrust is one<br>of those<br>and you can see the american congress at<br>the moment squaring up against amazon<br>and google<br>we're going to learn quite a lot of<br>political lessons from that<br>confrontation<br>about what the power of an elected body<br>actually is<br>in the face of organized and<br>deliberately strategically<br>deployed corporate muscle um<br>the same applies to the fossil fuel<br>lobby versus the<br>um the the institutions that are dealing<br>with<br>that are set up to deal with climate<br>change in new zealand our debate around<br>the emissions trading scheme for example<br>um is a perfect example of precisely the<br>political economy problem that we<br>we have all sorts of nominal uh things<br>set up which enabled jacinda to<br>cover herself with with with claims<br>about being world leading on the<br>and the climate change front but there<br>was no substance there because<br>every one of those instruments has been<br>undermined<br>and captured by the the big vested<br>interests that actually dominate<br>climate change policy how do we climb<br>out of that i mean is our<br>that's our own local little democratic<br>experiment whether in fact we can nail<br>the<br>uh nail to the wall the uh the big<br>interests that are bullying their way<br>to a failure of climate policy in new<br>zealand<br>um and you know i i'm genuinely<br>open-minded about that i don't know<br>what the answer is but with the greens<br>polling at five percent<br>um and an act piling higher<br>yeah i mean i i agree i think i think<br>the<br>the the political unpalatability of this<br>makes it incredibly difficult because<br>because we have populations who for<br>generations have<br>been living on the expectation that the<br>next generation will be wealthier<br>we will have more we will fly not only<br>to bali but maybe to the moon<br>i mean all of these expectations have<br>kept growing and it is<br>it is a sociological problem just as<br>much as it is a<br>a problem of vested interest i think and<br>so<br>at some point we're either going to have<br>to come to a judging halt with some of<br>the of the the experiences of of these<br>biophysical limits to growth or there's<br>going to have to be<br>some event which triggers thinking in a<br>new way and covert<br>has been quite powerful in in in doing<br>that<br>in that it has has i guess given us the<br>confidence that<br>a big challenge can be faced<br>collectively but but whether we can<br>translate those learnings<br>to this much bigger and ongoing picture<br>is<br>is is a as another question<br>and indeed janet on that the the<br>comparison with covid<br>uh while it has some merit also has some<br>demerit in the sense that<br>covet is a very urgent dramatic uh<br>life-threatening challenge now<br>whereas the problem with with the<br>various ecological limits we face<br>is that is that they're kind of less<br>immediate<br>less apparent to many people uh less<br>evident that<br>my individual life is at stake and so on<br>which makes the politics of addressing<br>these things<br>much more much more difficult now look i<br>thought maybe at this point<br>um there are various other comments in<br>the chat session but i see there's four<br>hands up at the moment<br>and i thought maybe we would just bring<br>some other folk into the conversation if<br>that's all right<br>um so uh rafe if you're there<br>i can allow you to talk and you can make<br>a comment or ask a question<br>and then i'll go through as if there's<br>lisa jack<br>and asa um and then maybe we come back<br>to the comments or there may be further<br>hands so<br>let's um go to you rafe if if you'd like<br>to unmute<br>and and make a comment sure um thanks<br>jonathan<br>hi everyone um yeah look building off<br>something jeff was saying um about um<br>the ability of economics to to adapt to<br>these issues or help us adapt<br>to these issues by uh adjusting prices<br>i i'd sort of agree in principle jeff um<br>that's what i<br>as an economist i i liked uh i<br>i was brought up to think but the<br>reality is that<br>any attempt we make to adapt prices<br>um tends to run into the you know the<br>problem of vested interest<br>as you've indicated um but it's worse<br>than that you know<br>that becomes a complete blockage so um<br>if you take the example of climate<br>change um you know we we've had attempts<br>to<br>introduce an ets um which has generated<br>modest prices but the sort of prices we<br>need<br>um in that area to to<br>indicate the the damage cost of what<br>we're doing<br>um around burning fossil fuels for<br>example is around<br>you know 600 or a thousand dollars per<br>ton um<br>it's not thirty five dollars per ton so<br>the political system can generate low<br>prices but not the sort of prices we<br>need to make the adjustments we need<br>um and um in fact<br>climate change is the you know the<br>ultimate example really because<br>i mean i agree with mike that we do have<br>a massive<br>problem of you know using up fossil<br>energy using up energy<br>in other forms um but the real<br>constraint<br>in terms of fossil fuels is actually the<br>climate change problem<br>um because we're run out of atmospheric<br>space long before we run out of fossil<br>fuels<br>um and um you know what what<br>um what we see with<br>the growing climate change problem is<br>that um<br>within 50 years we will have a massive<br>heat problem um just one manifestation<br>of climate change<br>um you know with scientists are now<br>talking about<br>um you know three or four billion people<br>uh living in<br>insufferable conditions within 50 years<br>um and that that is going to completely<br>collapse civilization<br>when you don't have a billion people or<br>more um<br>one to three um living in<br>you know temperatures of over 30 degrees<br>without<br>a huge political ramifications and<br>migration problems<br>so um these are much faster moving<br>incidentally than sea level rise as an<br>issue<br>um so i think um the sort of collapse<br>of um democratic governance that is<br>likely to come with<br>um lots of people knocking on the door<br>at the border um will confront us<br>very soon and long before we really run<br>out of<br>energy so that sounds a bit grim but i i<br>think the climate problem is<br>a good demonstration the incapacity of<br>price adjustments to deal with the<br>problem and it's<br>shortly and rapidly followed by the<br>incapacity of the political system<br>democratic systems in particular to<br>adjust quickly<br>enough to deal with the problems we face<br>thanks thanks uh rafe that adds to the<br>the dismal side of the<br>equation uh janet jeff mike did you want<br>to<br>respond at all well i'll i'll agree with<br>with rafe but just emphasize<br>that um when you're looking at the price<br>mechanism it's a matter of<br>magnitude and timing uh and<br>if you if you want the price mechanism<br>that is if you want to do things by<br>carbon taxes for example<br>uh to work uh then you have to allow<br>a time frame within which uh response to<br>the economic incentives<br>can take place and you have to put a<br>strong enough signal in<br>at the outset to make sure that you get<br>that response<br>so starting 30 years ago you know i<br>wanted to see us get a cabin tax on<br>which by now<br>uh would almost certainly have gone to<br>the range that rafe was talking about<br>hundreds of dollars a ton it could well<br>have started the five<br>or ten or twenty dollars a time back in<br>1989<br>1990 and escalated steadily up and as it<br>did so it would have generated a growing<br>incentive<br>with plenty of time for investment to<br>take place uh<br>in response to it now i believe that<br>we're past the point where the price<br>mechanism is actually going to be the<br>answer<br>uh you know sticking on a return<br>carbon tax now um just produces a lot of<br>chaos<br>when we're at the point now where<br>quantity instruments are almost<br>unavoidable if we're serious about<br>dealing with climate change<br>um and the pricing system will then<br>throw up whatever shadow prices are<br>implied by the quantities that we see<br>and and yet the kind of regulatory<br>instruments that<br>that you're foreshadowing jeff that we<br>need are going to be<br>also extremely difficult politically<br>yeah<br>okay uh lisa i<br>uh allowing you to talk if you unmute<br>yourself and please<br>feel free to make a comment or ask a<br>question<br>thanks everybody this has been just a<br>wonderful morning<br>i'd like to say that of all the bad news<br>i heard today<br>the most depressing sentence was the one<br>that mike said about<br>being a scientist remember he said i'm<br>going to be a scientist and talk about<br>science i'm not going to talk about<br>money<br>and i really worry that our very best<br>scientists don't have faith in our<br>capacity<br>as social scientists to understand um<br>things that work and things that don't<br>in terms of organization<br>we can see in this conversation that<br>people<br>have repeatedly said we just said well<br>particularly democratic systems are not<br>good at constraining elites<br>what evidence do we have for this what<br>evidence do we have that non-democratic<br>systems are worse at<br>managing the rationing of<br>resources we don't have any evidence of<br>this<br>i was i was really encouraged by jeff's<br>recent<br>points talking about observing the<br>american congress trying to take<br>anti-trust steps<br>looking at the experiment happening in<br>new zealand with the<br>manifestly inadequate but still<br>interesting ets<br>that's a social scientific perspective<br>we know that we can constrain<br>our institutions you know capitalism<br>that's given this is not<br>the same as piracy it's required<br>organization to succeed<br>we know that we can affect these things<br>so early on<br>jeff was talking about waiting for the<br>platonic<br>philosopher kings we already have those<br>they're not doing too well let's not<br>look for elite leadership on this<br>there's good evidence that more<br>democratic decision-making<br>especially taking into account the views<br>of people that we haven't been talking<br>about today the people who are already<br>experiencing these things<br>on their bodies would actually give us<br>better policy outcomes so<br>i'm really hoping that we'll be evidence<br>based about our organizations<br>and not dismiss democracy when we<br>well thank you lisa there's a<br>provocative set of comments anybody want<br>to reply to that or<br>respond um i i just wanted to quickly um<br>respond to me i i don't i keep away from<br>money or<br>because of the company that i'm in in<br>this discussion but because i see it as<br>something incredibly abstract and<br>and when i look at you know i can<br>understand science but i can't<br>understand for example why the share<br>market's going up at the moment so<br>that's why<br>i decided to steer clear of it because i<br>right janet yes um lisa thank you for<br>that um<br>and and that's that's a wonderful<br>challenge and<br>um it pleases me that that you take a<br>positive<br>stance on this and i completely agree<br>that there are possibilities to do<br>things beyond<br>the human imagination in terms of<br>engagement and and collective action<br>but what i just want to pick up on on<br>mike's point about understanding money<br>um it is<br>i think um where i started my talk was<br>was to specifically try and hone in on<br>the on the very question that jonathan<br>economic growth which economic growth as<br>in<br>gdp increase and gdp per capita<br>and and as as a non-economist<br>when i look at money i i i'm completely<br>baffled<br>about about how we how we look at these<br>financial flows and what they're made up<br>of so we've got financial flows<br>that that that go completely into<br>investment bubbles and mean nothing at<br>all they're in futures markets they're<br>in there and um in in property that has<br>inflated value<br>um and then you have financial flows<br>increasingly<br>as jeff's already mentioned that are<br>going to be going into things like<br>fixing environmental disasters and that<br>that's counted as a positive in terms of<br>of gdp flow<br>um and then we have maybe some financial<br>flows that ultimately might go and build<br>healthy societies and healthy<br>environments which is kind of<br>the stock element of financial flows one<br>thing that really worries me is that is<br>that by focusing on gdp<br>as as a monolith we are when we're<br>conflating all of those things into the<br>same space<br>and not making use of of where those<br>flows<br>actually regenerating environments and<br>supporting<br>um social well-being and community<br>well-being<br>and that's a question i think that that<br>ecological economists and others<br>are grappling with but but it still is<br>the dominant trope if you look at a<br>media<br>article about about the state of the<br>economy it will always talk<br>about gdp and that is all of those weird<br>flows that actually add nothing at all<br>to the sum of of human well-being<br>i'd like to to just<br>say thanks lisa i agree with the<br>aspiration you have for democracy to be<br>the way in which we can implement<br>controls on elites um and<br>yes in my my cheerful moments i think<br>that maybe that is indeed the way<br>forward i do think it's important to<br>remember that the democratic program<br>that uh developed in the 18th century<br>with the enlightenment really<br>had an apogee in the 20th century when<br>we've developed the welfare state and<br>curbed capitalism and brought in serious<br>taxation of wealth<br>and established egalitarian<br>goals and passed the united nations<br>declaration of human rights and all of<br>those things<br>that that wave of democratic aspiration<br>and achievement<br>phil has fallen on hard times in the<br>last 50 years<br>and it's not just a failure of<br>the will of ordinary people to be<br>democratically effective<br>uh what has happened is a consolidation<br>of the counter-revolutionary ability<br>of large-scale wealth and power<br>to beat back democratic challenges<br>and to revive the democratic challenge<br>to wealth and power<br>it is not a trivial activity it does<br>require an awful lot of mobilization and<br>it requires some basis in<br>shared objective interests<br>and you know the the organization of the<br>working class and of women and all of<br>those things that gave us the democratic<br>surge in the 20th century<br>needs to be reproduced in the 21st if<br>we're going to get a democratic way<br>through this<br>um otherwise you know we are going to<br>end up with<br>the chinese model and<br>i know which i prefer in terms of<br>livability<br>uh and philosophical uh niceness<br>but what this there may or may not be a<br>trade-off between that and effectiveness<br>and i just<br>i can't give you an answer to that<br>because i don't know where democracy is<br>going to century<br>thank you jeff although we we can be<br>pretty confident democracy<br>is is under lots of strains and and<br>stresses and<br>there's more to come as as as jeff<br>sorry as rafe was highlighting uh as<br>well look there's several more<br>people with hands up so i'll take them<br>and then perhaps we'll go back to the<br>chat<br>session um jack you're welcome to<br>uh contribute if you like to unmute<br>uh thank you uh first of all i'd like to<br>thank the folks that organized this this<br>is an incredibly important<br>discussion and and uh i'm i was<br>very pleased to hear you say that it's<br>going to continue because there are so<br>many aspects to this<br>it's hard to know quite where to respond<br>to and i'd like to make a comment about<br>the whole democracy<br>issue and the capture of elites and so<br>on by decision makers but<br>i'd also like to come back to some<br>simple concepts<br>and um you know jeff mentioned<br>the the role of the market and supply<br>and demand and pricing mechanisms and<br>obviously<br>the market is an incredibly powerful and<br>useful<br>tool for allocating resources<br>um but it's it also has some deficits<br>some some defects and i think they're<br>very evident<br>if we look at the history of<br>environmental problems whether it's been<br>ddt<br>acid rain ozone depletion or even social<br>problems<br>health related like smoking these issues<br>that scientists raised and provided<br>evidence for were resisted<br>that it often took decades for<br>the market to adjust and and that<br>suggests<br>to me that you know<br>waiting for problems to emerge when<br>there's evidence<br>that they exist is a conceptual<br>framework that is<br>flawed and jonathan mentioned<br>ecological economics and minor<br>imperfect understanding of economics in<br>general<br>but that as well is that there's an<br>attempt there in ecological economics<br>which<br>is a fairly rigorous conceptual<br>framework<br>to contain to put limits<br>the kinds of limits that jeff was<br>talking about whether it's rationing or<br>quotas<br>as an integral part of decision making<br>you know we have we have data we have a<br>precautionary principle that can be<br>applied in these circumstances to help<br>us anticipate<br>the kinds of problems we might have if<br>we go down a particular path<br>and i i i think that<br>it speaks to the need to reconceptualize<br>how we think about economics<br>if if economics is going to serve us<br>well<br>as it has in the past we need it to be<br>compatible with the hard science<br>sciences it can't be you know these<br>these incompatible thoughts that<br>jeff mentioned um to me they should be a<br>stimulus for saying how do we integrate<br>this knowledge<br>we can't simply accept the fact that<br>they're dissonant<br>and and go on with our lives and our<br>decision making<br>so again i think we have to come back to<br>reconceptualizing<br>economics and and ensuring that it's<br>compatible with<br>the hard science the second point um<br>i'd like to make with respect to the<br>difficulties if you if you if you could<br>be reasonably brief if that's all right<br>i shall i shall i simply want to say<br>that in terms of decision making and<br>and the power of elites the the<br>um there's a whole range of mechanisms<br>in deliberative democracy<br>such as citizens assemblies which<br>to me are opportunities to<br>to have a truly democratic inputs<br>because they're<br>they're informed people have good<br>information<br>it's facilitated so certain parties<br>can't dominate or use their power<br>so we do have mechanisms to do these<br>things<br>and and there's more to be said<br>obviously but i'll stop and<br>uh thank you thank you so really two big<br>issues there one around<br>uh reconceptualizing aspects of<br>the discipline of economics and perhaps<br>jeff the the discipline of economics<br>taking<br>biophysical constraints uh more<br>seriously<br>uh and the evidence of the sciences and<br>so on and then the issue of really<br>governance mechanisms and the extent to<br>which new<br>uh means of democratic discourse and<br>decision making can potentially help us<br>in the current circumstances anybody<br>want to comment on<br>those two aspects<br>jeff well yeah i i worry about people<br>who want to reconceptualize economics as<br>they see it<br>um because<br>there's a terrific amount of good solid<br>stuff in economics technically speaking<br>what's gone wrong in economics is not<br>that the tools aren't there<br>what's gone wrong is that the discipline<br>repeatedly is ideologically captured<br>um for the same reasons that democracy<br>is up against difficulty<br>the incentives that economics that<br>economists have<br>the attitudes that they tend to acquire<br>uh the company that they tend to keep<br>uh all have a malignant effect on the<br>willingness of their profession it's<br>more the willingness of the profession<br>to engage with this stuff<br>um not the ability if if if we could<br>persuade economists<br>on on mass to seriously get into this<br>i think you'd find that there's plenty<br>of good equipment in the economic<br>toolbox to use<br>and you know when i when i think about<br>putting on quantity limits<br>uh as a matter of dealing with climate<br>change<br>i don't have any difficulty finding<br>plenty of ways then of following through<br>the adjustments that would be that would<br>result from that and the incentives that<br>that would set up for<br>for players in the economic sphere uh<br>the difficulty i think is ideological<br>rather than technical put it that way<br>can i add to that i i think another<br>aspect of the problem is is<br>is the is the god-like status that<br>economists have<br>in in in critical aspects of government<br>um and and when when you look at many<br>departments<br>absolutely critical departments people<br>come from that<br>ideologically captured um area of<br>economics unfortunately<br>and have an overbearing influence on<br>on the way things are talked about<br>thought about the limits<br>around thinking um and um<br>my my my plea would be for for<br>government to reach out much more<br>broadly into other disciplines<br>and to into first of all encourage<br>economists and other disciplines to talk<br>to each other much more closely but also<br>tend to start to equalize the the<br>influence of of economists versus<br>all right well look i mean just a quick<br>comment and then i'll bring in actually<br>uh one of our<br>leading economists arthur grimes but<br>just to say obviously the discipline of<br>economics jeff as you're well aware<br>uh traverses uh people with a wide range<br>of philosophical perspectives<br>you know you mentioned marx uh before<br>but you know in the contemporary<br>environment there are<br>very distinguished economists who've<br>been grappling with the issues that<br>we're talking about today people like<br>uh uh lord stern um<br>stiglitz uh sen and many others<br>and and their views uh would be<br>i think probably a little more<br>compatible jeff with with with yours<br>and and and and those of mike and so on<br>then<br>there are many other economists so it's<br>not as if there's a there's a unitary<br>view here there's a there's a vigorous<br>discourse within<br>economics but i guess it's a question of<br>who who carries the influence of the<br>of the discipline and who do political<br>leaders uh listen to<br>arthur let me unmute you and um please i<br>can let you<br>speak and you just need to unmute<br>yourself which you have so please<br>um comment uh in whatever way you wish<br>thanks jonathan thanks panel um first of<br>all can just make one very brief comment<br>and then a question<br>um the comment i think is that<br>economists been grappling with this<br>these issues for decades if you go back<br>to the 70s nord house and tobin both<br>nobel prize winners wrote about this<br>called for the<br>need to address these issues back then<br>before them kuznetsov there's another<br>nobel prize winner before them piggy<br>um one of the greatest economists of the<br>20th century well this is something<br>economists have been dealing with for<br>many decades<br>in the academic sphere it's the people<br>in government<br>that have been ignoring economists who<br>have been talking about this for decades<br>most people who actually work as<br>economists in government are not<br>economists<br>they don't have strong economic training<br>so janet contrary to your view<br>actually we don't we have very very few<br>people with economics training in any of<br>the major<br>departments of government so that's the<br>real layer because they don't understand<br>what academic economists have been<br>saying for<br>many many decades now so that's a<br>comment<br>but janet can i come to your point about<br>needing a change in mindset about<br>economic growth and i want to bring it<br>down to the individual level<br>um and i have this problem about framing<br>this in terms of gdp per capita which is<br>not your<br>fault but um the idea that we've got to<br>have a change in mindset can i think of<br>a young person coming out of<br>training um and i'll so i'll give an<br>anecdote my son<br>um he's a musician and he's about put<br>out his first single on spotify<br>um if he doesn't sell anything he won't<br>contribute to economic growth<br>if he manages to sell some of his uh<br>songs on spotify<br>a small amount he'll be contributing to<br>economic growth if he sells a huge<br>number of that song<br>he'll be contributing even more to<br>economic growth um<br>now what should we tell that young<br>person should we say to him no please<br>don't aspire to<br>actually have a hit song please just do<br>nothing and sit there and play your tune<br>to your friend<br>and it won't count for economic growth<br>or shall we say no let's be aspirational<br>and actually go out and produce<br>something<br>i mean i find it can you imagine being a<br>young person now and being told<br>don't produce anything i mean it's just<br>it seems extraordinarily<br>bad for young people's psychological<br>well-being to say to them<br>i'll sleep in here i think you<br>completely misinterpreted me<br>um in in in this respect i i it was no<br>way in my presentation that i ever said<br>um that young people should not aspire<br>to economic growth or that anybody<br>should not i was merely questioning the<br>potential for<br>the growth for the economy to continue<br>to grow indefinitely and and talked<br>about the kind of limits that that were<br>present to to actually suggest that that<br>might be the case<br>so so please don't don't misinterpret me<br>there<br>um i was also more recently in the<br>discussion<br>around gdp gdp flows suggesting that we<br>needed to start thinking<br>more carefully about what it is that<br>we're counting um and what it is that's<br>important in terms of those flows so<br>so that that in itself is i guess a more<br>of a<br>uh um an ethical question a a future<br>focused question<br>um should should the flows of of of of<br>money in the economy be more focused on<br>on restoration and<br>and um um tangible ways of<br>enabling future generations to survive<br>or should we<br>still be giving huge credibility<br>to other flows that have a negative<br>impact<br>or no impact at all on those long term<br>requirements<br>well i'd agree that gdp is a very poor<br>measure so and i think that's the<br>problem of framing this in terms of gdp<br>debate<br>as opposed to what it is that we should<br>be trying to achieve with the economy i<br>mean it's<br>it's um so um yeah but you know the<br>mindset shouldn't be don't go out and<br>produce something if you can produce<br>something that's worthwhile<br>but then uh if i could comment after the<br>question is what is<br>worthwhile and the example you give is<br>is understandable to everyone but<br>suppose suppose this music was doing<br>harm<br>to people well suppose the activity was<br>you know<br>intensive dairying which is contributing<br>to<br>the problems that mike has been working<br>on all the problems<br>of climate change but we don't have a<br>price mechanism or a regulatory<br>framework which<br>minimizes those problems so that so that<br>your son<br>yes is is going to be contributing to<br>gdp and possibly contributing to his own<br>well-being in a variety of ways but in<br>the long run he's he's contributing to<br>uh very damaging activities that are<br>going to cost uh future generations an<br>enormous amount to put right<br>so partly the whole issue is really<br>about the regulatory framework isn't it<br>well you know i mean it's just it<br>doesn't follow that it's going to<br>contribute to something as negative does<br>it<br>just because he's contributing to<br>economic growth that doesn't con<br>it doesn't follow no no no but my point<br>my point jeff is simply<br>what contributes to uh growth and or<br>well-being<br>uh is going to depend on the nature of<br>that activity<br>um and and there's you know there's an<br>intertemporal aspect of this<br>too isn't that um so<br>something might be contributing<br>positively in the near term but actually<br>have a very damaging<br>effect in in the long run because you're<br>actually<br>exceeding limits which then collapse<br>your capacity to do things<br>oh absolutely some activities do and<br>that's why it's not useful in my view to<br>conceptualize this in terms of gdp sure<br>sure i do so<br>though i think we can we we can maybe<br>distinguish between<br>restorative growth and something else<br>consumptive growth i don't i don't know<br>what what what tim<br>you would you would give it but but but<br>restorative growth being<br>growth that enables us to live within<br>earth's capacity<br>um that rebuilds restores regenerates<br>and builds stocks as opposed to<br>focuses on on those those flows which<br>gdp<br>as currently measured tends to tends to<br>focus on<br>so i mean the there was a paper and the<br>collection of papers by pierce talking<br>about constant capital this idea that we<br>uh invest in uh the financial flows<br>should<br>should invest in um making a world<br>which has sufficient resources for the<br>future generation to<br>to use which then they can pass on to<br>the one after rather than focusing on<br>short-term gains or valued as<br>bubbles um and and to me that<br>somewhere in here there there's a need<br>to distinguish between the kinds of<br>growth that we are after<br>and as i said in my mind i'm talk think<br>i'm thinking restorative versus<br>consumptive but i'm sure there are<br>some very smart economists out there<br>who've thought about other ways of<br>of um of wording that idea yeah<br>thanks thanks jeff did you want to<br>comment or mike<br>um otherwise we'll go to some further<br>questions well i just wanted to pick up<br>the comment about mozart<br>um because mozart is<br>a beautiful example of something done<br>two centuries ago<br>which continues to resonate and give<br>pleasure and will continue to do so for<br>a long time in the future<br>so when janet talks about you know what<br>can people aspire to achieve<br>it's quite worthwhile thinking can they<br>aspire to achieve something that really<br>will<br>resonate down future generations as a<br>solid benefit uh it may be that arthur's<br>son's music<br>will be of mozart's caliber i can't<br>judge it because it's not released yet<br>um but i'm writing something though so i<br>don't know<br>i think you have to distinguish between<br>the mozarts who genuinely leave<br>community better off<br>um and the exxon mobils who<br>possibly don't yeah i i probably<br>shouldn't say this but<br>our electric car which i probably<br>shouldn't have for mike's point of view<br>uh is able to uh pick up<br>a a romanian radio station which plays<br>mozart 24 7 which i listen to just about<br>every time i go in the car<br>so um like you arthur i i very much<br>appreciate mozart<br>um mike did you want to comment<br>otherwise we'll go to some<br>no okay so there's a question here from<br>wallace ray<br>uh should we have a population limit uh<br>for new zealand<br>um very interesting one uh i was at a<br>gathering<br>yesterday in which a very senior public<br>servant said uh<br>it's it's it's a a tragedy sort of in<br>new zealand that we've never had<br>a population policy i don't know what<br>the person<br>thought population policy should be but<br>but anyway um<br>the issue of population often comes up<br>in these sorts of conversations so did<br>does anybody wish to to comment jeff you<br>did refer to infanticide as<br>as uh one of the ways in which<br>particular<br>communities have sought to<br>manage their biophysical limits<br>uh in the past well there's your problem<br>uh<br>there is always a limit to population<br>like it or not malthus continues to have<br>a<br>solid grain of truth that if you<br>expand the numbers beyond what is a<br>sustainable<br>number given the carrying capacity of<br>the space that they're on<br>uh it will be limited it may be plague<br>it may be war<br>it may be famine<br>one or another of the biophysical checks<br>ultimately limits population so<br>the the question about what you do<br>within those limits is a matter of<br>genuine choice<br>should we have a population policy in<br>new zealand<br>well i suppose we should but we would<br>need to think very carefully about<br>exactly what that policy is and what the<br>implications<br>as i mentioned earlier you can envisage<br>in new zealand which<br>sets itself up as a little island of<br>affluence and prosperity and<br>manageable population and a global<br>setting where<br>where the malthusian checks become much<br>more pressing and<br>and damaging and how you balance<br>the self-interest of the winds of the<br>people who are already here in new<br>zealand<br>against what would be the interests of<br>the massive humanity elsewhere on the<br>planet i think is a really difficult<br>question<br>and it's not one that economists are<br>going to be well placed to answer it's a<br>janet can i just say um that malthus<br>lived in an era where they didn't<br>actually realize that the best<br>way of controlling population is to give<br>women<br>education and this is<br>incredibly well established and and i i<br>think that that we we need to<br>um to turn our minds to to social and<br>equitable solutions to this population<br>problem rather than see it as as the<br>problem of those out there<br>who who will eventually die off through<br>pestilence or whatever so<br>so let's take a positive view on this um<br>the the question of new zealand's<br>ultimate population i think<br>is is a really difficult one but i i<br>would say that i think that increasingly<br>we are going to be faced by<br>climate migrants particularly from the<br>pacific which will have<br>enormous implications for new zealand um<br>and we'll probably also have incredibly<br>wealthy climate migrants from other<br>parts of the world and so<br>i think it's more important to to turn<br>our minds to how we're going to grapple<br>with these very real and pressing<br>issues um and to what extent are our<br>board is going to be open because<br>as a nation we've never really faced the<br>migrant<br>issue prior and are we going to be<br>supportive and encouraging or are we<br>going to<br>have a sense that we should close our<br>borders and this is i think<br>a really critical issue for us to<br>thank you janet mike i just wanted to<br>mention that um<br>i don't think the pop you know it's hard<br>to talk about just new zealand but<br>but a tiny proportion of the human<br>population have<br>most of the impact it's not about<br>numbers of people it's about consumption<br>and<br>and and levels of affluence and the<br>impact they have so<br>um it's i i always you know feel<br>uncomfortable with that population<br>argument it's it's<br>way more about distribution than it is<br>about population<br>thank you jeff all right now there was a<br>number of other comments in the<br>in the chat session um there's one for<br>me<br>which uh from robert which i think i<br>might pass on robert simply to say<br>i think this is from perhaps another<br>occasion uh it's a question around<br>the the welsh legislation<br>the well-being of future generations uh<br>bracket wales act<br>and the institutions that that's<br>established notably the welsh<br>commissioner for the future<br>and the question is about whether that's<br>relevant for new zealand i i think maybe<br>this is an issue we could we could have<br>a<br>useful discussion on when we're thinking<br>about institutions<br>um for sustainability and so forth so<br>maybe we come back to that<br>um there's a comment then um<br>about from wright about a growth uh<br>there's a comment from<br>nathan um and there's a comment from<br>uh in fact there's a comment from<br>murray is it yes so maybe we go to<br>murray<br>uh if economic counts don't include<br>real stocks and flows including sinks in<br>capacities then they're flying blind<br>well maybe jeff you could just quickly<br>comment on that because you know gdp<br>measures flows it doesn't measure stocks<br>so you can be running down your stocks<br>you can be despoiling your sinks<br>or whatever but that doesn't necessarily<br>show up in gdp at least until you hit<br>certain barriers<br>um do you want to quickly comment on<br>that oh yeah well i mean<br>it shouldn't be in gdp specifically gdp<br>is about flows<br>and purely about flows the stocks<br>analysis is the<br>question question of national wealth or<br>global wealth<br>and there is work going on always in<br>national income accounting<br>attempting to quantify and measure those<br>and the framework for<br>sustaining them has been<br>going round and round since the um since<br>that<br>definitions of sustainability was<br>debated back in the 1980s and<br>uh and 90s whether we are looking at the<br>hard sustainability that is preserving<br>preserving stocks as they are or whether<br>we're<br>allowing substitution so that we are<br>sustaining the same capabilities over<br>time to support<br>uh levels of gdp flows<br>and i think uh generally it's agreed<br>that uh<br>that soft sustainability is where you<br>have to go<br>hard sustainability it just gets too<br>hard too quickly<br>um but on the other hand you do need to<br>keep in mind the sort of things that<br>mike is talking about because that's<br>where<br>the hard sustainability constraints do<br>bite<br>to run with soft sustainability you have<br>to have the substitute ability<br>the technological options open that<br>enable you to<br>replace one resource as it is depleted<br>with another that doesn't deplete<br>and we really do not know whether that<br>is<br>physically feasible or not and and to<br>what extent<br>uh and to the extent that it's not<br>feasible mike's view of the future is<br>all right um i mean perhaps you know<br>arthur has<br>rightly raised the question should we be<br>focused on on gdp<br>and biophysical limits or or other<br>measures and<br>uh jeff as you've indicated gdp is only<br>one of a range of measures it only<br>measures flows it doesn't measure stocks<br>there are measures of stocks they've<br>been much debated they're continuing to<br>be refined<br>um but there's also of course uh other<br>ways of conceptualizing<br>uh what we should be aiming at in terms<br>of whatever progress<br>um which includes obviously various<br>notions of living standards well-being<br>welfare and so on and so forth um<br>i'd simply comment though that you know<br>the focus on gdp<br>certainly hasn't gone away in the media<br>locally or internationally<br>uh almost daily there are reports you<br>know from international organizations<br>uh from governments reporting their gdp<br>figures<br>um and what they expect them to be next<br>year so<br>while while we might have see serious<br>and and<br>intellectually valid reservations about<br>about<br>gdp as a measure and as a goal um it's<br>still very dominant in<br>public discourse um nathan has got a<br>question here<br>uh and we've just got a couple more<br>minutes so<br>if i could just quickly summarize this<br>he says given the biophysical limits now<br>apparent<br>should we be able to talk about the<br>reality that we can't sustain what we<br>have<br>in anything vaguely approaching its<br>current form we're facing a 50<br>decline in all liquid fuel supply over<br>15 years or so<br>due to the highest rate of supply having<br>been reached<br>do we not do we have a 100 year<br>perspective what utopia bounded by<br>entropy<br>should be aiming for and have any of you<br>read samuel alexander's<br>entropia which attempts to paint<br>that picture so any<br>quick responses to that now before we<br>janet mike um i i just wanted to say<br>that it's come up a couple of times here<br>this whether it<br>whether it's um the end of fossil fuels<br>or the<br>well the fact that we have to stop using<br>them for climate change reasons<br>i i see that the same thing i would i<br>just use this kind of<br>metaphor of a pair of scissors and or a<br>pair of secateurs that are chopping your<br>finger off it doesn't matter<br>which of the two blades has the most<br>pressure on it the<br>finger's still going to get chopped off<br>so i think they're just combined forces<br>that we have to think about and<br>and yes i have read entropia and uh it's<br>given me a lot of hope about the future<br>so<br>um yeah i'm probably the only one that<br>i'll press up i haven't read it<br>in a sense the question is a systemic<br>one can capitalism survive this<br>particular crisis<br>um and you know capitalism is the system<br>with a lot of adaptive ability<br>it's also a system with really serious<br>limitations<br>because of the fact that it's driven by<br>the quest for profit and because profit<br>does tend to require growth um and so<br>i i i i see this as a<br>as a question really of what economic<br>system<br>potentially can respond in a way that<br>enables humanity to survive through the<br>next century<br>and i think the jury is out i have an<br>open mind on whether capitalism is going<br>to be able to reinvent itself to face<br>a 50 decline in fuel supply over 15<br>years<br>history suggests it's probably going to<br>give it a good shot<br>but i'm not sure that i can bet on the<br>outcome<br>janet yeah so i mean for me<br>taking taking that hundred year view is<br>is the one that has to become<br>um absolutely fundamental to all the<br>decisions we make<br>so decisions of of<br>national investment decisions of around<br>infrastructure<br>decisions around what kind of business<br>investments we make but i think i think<br>one thing that is becoming very evident<br>is that we have<br>essentially reached peak wealth um<br>it's certainly looking like that i i<br>don't think that as a as a globe the<br>the the the average wealth of of of um<br>people can be expected to get a lot<br>greater because of the biophysical<br>limits that we're already<br>facing and in fact to live within the<br>limits<br>um i strongly suspect that the ways that<br>we live are going to have to change<br>to much lower levels of consumption much<br>lower expectations of<br>of the trappings of wealth but on the<br>other hand<br>much greater social<br>um and and psychological um<br>positivity i think could potentially<br>flow from that and i think we've seen<br>again from the covert experience how how<br>slowing down<br>how doing this how becoming much more<br>localized<br>can actually um have benefits for for<br>people's well-being<br>um accepting that some people were in a<br>really bad situation and and did not<br>um um appreciate those kind of benefits<br>but<br>but more generally this there is huge<br>potential<br>in in a future in which we do not<br>consume so much and and therefore<br>don't ask so much of our economic system<br>all right well look thank you janet uh<br>thank you jeff thank you mike<br>thank you to those who have been<br>participating in this uh<br>conversation um as uh highlighted<br>at the beginning uh i was hoping this<br>would be the first of a<br>perhaps an ongoing series of<br>conversations we've traversed a wide<br>range<br>of issues but we've also traversed many<br>of them very fleetingly<br>so i would welcome uh important advice<br>as we think about future webinars over<br>the coming months and years<br>and and advice particularly on the on<br>the specific issues that people would<br>would like to<br>uh focus on in more detail i'm conscious<br>for example we<br>we really haven't dealt in in much depth<br>with specific resource constraints uh<br>mike has raised the issue of the energy<br>return on investment<br>that's an issue that potentially could<br>could be the subject of a dedicated<br>conversation<br>uh we haven't talked a great deal about<br>the um<br>absorptive capacity of the biosphere and<br>the issues that that raises<br>particularly in relation to climate<br>change for example uh and<br>in the issues around decarbonization<br>though mike has rightly raised the issue<br>of the<br>uh the tech the well the resource<br>constraints and pepsi energy constraints<br>on decarbonization and achieving<br>what needs to be done in order to to to<br>stabilize the climate system<br>um we've touched briefly on issues of<br>substitutability but that's another<br>big topic area we've talked briefly<br>about adaptability<br>uh and the capacity of our<br>sociopolitical systems<br>uh to respond to the crises that we face<br>uh again<br>those will be areas where we could<br>potentially uh dedicate a specific<br>session<br>so there's a wide range of issues here<br>um i'm very appreciative<br>of of the contributions uh that janet<br>mike and jeff have made<br>um but i'd also welcome uh<br>feedback and and comments on on the kind<br>of<br>conversation that people would like to<br>continue just a couple of other things<br>obviously the climate change commission<br>will be<br>uh issuing its draft budgets i think<br>in february next year um budgets for<br>emissions for the period 2022 to 2020<br>2035<br>that's obviously going to be an<br>important development in new zealand's<br>uh tackling of climate change issues<br>globally there are<br>important reports coming up uh obviously<br>the intergovernmental panel on climate<br>change sixth assessment<br>report and the um<br>review uh of the economics of<br>biodiversity<br>um that is being undertaken for the<br>british treasury so a range of a range<br>of<br>important topics that could be the<br>subject of future webinars<br>but for now if i could just thank<br>everybody and wish you well<br>and look forward to further<br>conversations so<br>thank you very much and all the very<br>best</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
