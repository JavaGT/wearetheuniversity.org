He has published widely in this area and has held numerous research grants from Marsden and MBIE. Richard completed his undergraduate and PhD studies in the Biochemistry Department at Otago. He then worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the John Innes Centre, an international centre of excellence in plant science in the UK, before returning to Otago to establish his research group.<br><br>Much of Richard’s research has focused on discovering the genes that enable plants to flower in response to seasonal cues, such as winter cold and the increasing day length of spring. When a plant flowers determines when it produces its fruit or grain, therefore understanding the genetic basis of this trait can aid the breeding of crops better suited to local environmental conditions. To achieve this, Richard and his colleagues work closely with researchers from the Crown Research Institutes and plant breeding companies.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

somewhat<br>unwell<br>and we also have apologies from paul<br>brunton<br>um the pro vice chancellor of health<br>sciences so we're a slightly diminished<br>group but we're still<br>here for this celebration for richard<br>mcknight<br>so for those of you who don't know me<br>i'm pat cragg<br>and i'm the deputy vice chancellor<br>academic<br>at the university of otago and it's<br>going to give me great pleasure<br>to open this inaugural professorial<br>lecture<br>for professor richard mcknight<br>on behalf of the university i'd like to<br>begin by extending a particularly

emeritus professor<br>tony mcknight<br>and his wife dr jocelyn mcknight<br>prestigious family line<br>and we also have at least three of the<br>siblings<br>i can see some of them yes and various<br>partners and members of their family so<br>it's really wonderful<br>that mcknight's and their extended<br>family could all<br>be with us today the presence<br>of family is a clear signal of the<br>importance of<br>these types of occasions and of course<br>i'd also like to acknowledge and welcome<br>staff and students from across the<br>university<br>and members of the wider dunedin<br>community<br>and for many of these inaugural<br>professorial lectures<br>the chancellor dr royden somerville<br>right at the back<br>thank you again for attending these<br>sessions<br>these ipl's are always a time of<br>celebration<br>and a pride for the university of otago<br>so i'm delighted to see so many people<br>here<br>to mark this important milestone in<br>richard's career<br>to be promoted to professor as harleen<br>hayne will always say<br>is no mean feat you have to be<br>outstanding<br>you have to show leadership and you have<br>to do it across<br>teaching research and service<br>as you will learn this evening professor<br>richard mcknight<br>is a passionate teacher and a popular<br>postgraduate supervisor he is also<br>a successful and well-funded researcher<br>and his research career has been marked<br>by success<br>in both the basic and applied projects<br>and this is in the field of plant<br>biology biology<br>plant biochemistry and plant genetics<br>his career he has provided exceptional<br>service<br>to his discipline his academic<br>department<br>and to new zealand more broadly<br>his expertise in plant genetics is<br>highly sought after<br>by multiple professional bodies too many<br>to mention but i will mention the royal<br>society of new zealand<br>and the auckland city council last<br>but certainly not least richard is an<br>extremely<br>collegial member of our academic<br>community<br>so richard on behalf of the university<br>of otago<br>it gives me great pleasure to<br>congratulate you<br>on your very well earned promotion to<br>professor<br>i'm very much looking forward to your<br>lecture<br>and i'm now going to call on emeritus<br>professor frank griffin<br>to tell us a bit more than i have about<br>richard's<br>academic journey to professor<br>giora acting vice<br>chancellor distinguished academics<br>fellow academics friends and family<br>it is an honor for me to be here this<br>evening to give you a little biosketch<br>of richard's activity for those of you<br>who are not familiar with with the scope<br>of his work<br>so we're going to hear tonight how<br>plants<br>know when to flower which sounds very<br>romantic and quite exciting<br>but what i want to do is give you the<br>chronology of<br>his academic development and it's lovely<br>to see a professor here<br>in the university of otago gown i<br>remember when we came<br>when i came here there were very few<br>otago gowns ever in evidence<br>and it's lovely now to see you've<br>replaced most of the overseas funnies<br>with<br>local graduates and that's wonderful so<br>richard grew up in dunedin and he<br>studied botany and biochemistry at the<br>university of otago<br>he graduated bsc honors in biochemistry<br>in 1990<br>and then did his phd which he completed<br>in 1993<br>both working with associate professor<br>kevin farnham obviously he had a very<br>good training in that area<br>he then left dunedin and went on the<br>typical<br>overseas post doc and he went to the<br>john innes center in norwich<br>where he uh acted as post-doc between<br>1994 and 98<br>working with caroline dean who<br>subsequently became<br>dame caroline dean frs one of britain's<br>most prestigious<br>academics and that obviously is a mark<br>of his progress because<br>having a successful postdoc in a high<br>quality lab<br>is wonderful training for us all when we<br>leave our alma mater<br>so richard returned then from britain<br>in 1998 on a repatriation fellowship<br>by the new zealand lottery science<br>repatriation scheme<br>and he started his own research as part<br>of that fellowship<br>on flowering time in plants and went on<br>to be awarded a marsden grant as a<br>principal investigator in 2000<br>in 2001 richard was appointed a lecturer<br>in biochemistry<br>and subsequently he progressed through<br>the academic ranks in the department<br>to become senior lecturer in 2004 and<br>associate professor<br>in 2014 leading to his chair today<br>in parallel to his academic developments<br>at otago<br>he was appointed in 2012 as a senior<br>scientist<br>at plant and food limited on a 0.2<br>fte appointment and this involved in<br>working fridays<br>but it also allowed him to strengthen<br>valuable collaborations between<br>otago university and plant and food and<br>there was a reciprocal arrangement<br>established by plant and food<br>where one of their scientists had a 0.2<br>appointment at biochemistry<br>hence we had a continuous link between<br>the two institutions<br>which was very productive his funding<br>since 2000 has raised more than five<br>million dollars<br>in funds from all the prestigious<br>research funding agencies in the country<br>anybody who can get five marsons over a<br>career<br>he's doing an awful lot better than i<br>did<br>but during the course he got major funds<br>from forced on the control of flowering<br>and onions<br>from marsden on flowering in legumes<br>from ag mart on rye grass hybridization<br>and mb grant on non-heading in ryegrass<br>or non-flowering and numerous grants<br>from local agencies the osms orgy and<br>the light<br>throughout his career richard has<br>enjoyed productive collaborations with<br>plant and food<br>ag research and a number of the major<br>seed companies in new zealand<br>his research has involved a mix of<br>fundamental science<br>and the development of applied<br>innovative technologies<br>some of which have been patented and<br>since 2015<br>i'm very glad to say that he's been an<br>executive member of the<br>agriculture initiative at otago through<br>ag and otago<br>and this year through the development of<br>the new degree ag innovation<br>in 2013 he won best paper award in the<br>otago<br>medical school he got the roger slack<br>biology award<br>and he won the translational award in<br>2016<br>and an otago proof of concept award in<br>2017.<br>in 2018 richard was elected president<br>of the new zealand society of plant<br>biologists<br>richard has supervised 16 phd students<br>11 msc students and 13 honors students<br>our delight in richard gaining his chair<br>is reinforced by exciting prospects<br>as to where plant molecular biology can<br>take us in the future<br>it's a very very exciting theme where<br>many of the big questions in biology<br>resolve around plant biology<br>increasing plant diversity is one of the<br>most pressing ecological issues facing<br>our planet<br>its success will rely heavily on an<br>improved understanding of the functional<br>biology of our plants<br>and their ability to contribute to<br>sequestration of greenhouse gases<br>and the like the recent discovery of the<br>plant hola biont<br>is to me amazingly exciting what we now<br>see<br>plants just like humans having more<br>microorganisms<br>than host organisms associated with them<br>and this obviously gives<br>incredible genetic scope to an organism<br>and hopefully it will inform the<br>research<br>richard continues to do so we see very<br>exciting prospects in the future<br>we're delighted you will be an<br>ambassador for plant biology research<br>we thank you for your contribution to<br>the university so far and we look<br>forward to hearing<br>thank you very much for the<br>introductions thank you frank um<br>oh it's a great pleasure to to be here<br>and um lovely<br>see my family here so thank you all um<br>and a particular thank to to catherine<br>uh for all the support over<br>the years that she's given me um and to<br>our<br>son simon um i know from personal<br>experience it's not easy<br>to to be a a son of university parents<br>so so<br>i remember when simon was at primary<br>school<br>he and all the class people in this<br>class had to write down<br>what they wanted to be when they grow up<br>and it went on a poster<br>outside his classroom and of course<br>kids wrote down um that they would they<br>wanted to be<br>uh appreciate professional netballer<br>or a hockey player or something some of<br>the kids wanted to be youtubers which i<br>actually didn't know what youtubers even<br>were<br>but but one boy wrote down vice<br>chancellor<br>so there's a position coming up next<br>okay so in the talk today i want to talk<br>about how<br>and basic understanding of plant biology<br>and how genes work uh can lead to<br>uh developing enhanced crop plants and<br>my research is<br>involved in looking at a number of<br>examples flowering and a number of<br>examples of how understanding the basic<br>biology i think is is really important<br>so i was born in 1968 and that year<br>there's a book written the population<br>bomb<br>and on the cover it says while you're<br>reading these words five people mostly<br>children have died of starvation<br>and forty more babies uh have um<br>died they've been born 40 more babies<br>born<br>so it was painting a pretty grim picture<br>of the future of the<br>of the planet and as came to pass<br>worried about this big population<br>increase that was going to be seen and<br>has been seen<br>and how we're possibly going to feed<br>this growing population<br>so luckily there was plant biologists<br>and breeders<br>and through increasing the production<br>of and here we've got grain production<br>in this access<br>grain production was able to keep up<br>with this<br>amazing increase in population<br>and the surprising thing was that that<br>increase in grain production<br>was done on the same area of land that<br>it was in 1968 so it's all driven<br>through increased<br>productivity through better breeds<br>of of grain plant breeders and<br>intensification of agriculture and<br>we've still got this challenge uh today<br>population<br>is increasing through uh increased<br>number of adults and<br>adults uh living longer um so this is<br>this big issue of keeping feeding the<br>world<br>and we have to be able to do that um on<br>the same amount of agricultural land<br>and in a more sustainable way so farmers<br>getting criticized for the pollution and<br>everything so we need to be more<br>sustainable<br>and um and it's a big challenge<br>so to meet that challenge i'm passionate<br>about the fact that we need<br>innovation we need to use every tool<br>that we've got<br>to meet that challenge to feed the world<br>especially in front of climate change<br>which is making growing crops<br>uh more difficult and there's more crop<br>losses happening<br>so i'm very proud to be involved in<br>agatha otago<br>and the fact that otago is recognising<br>the importance of agriculture<br>and the role that it can play in<br>providing innovative solutions to to<br>some of these problems<br>and this year for the first time we have<br>a degree<br>in agricultural innovation so um a<br>really exciting initiative and i hope<br>you know we'll<br>train a future generation to try and<br>help solve these<br>okay so i'll start by just talking about<br>um my research career and<br>i started working for my phd with kevin<br>fondant<br>so kevin's a tremendous tremendous<br>supervisor so<br>personally thank him and in front of<br>everyone uh the tremendous job he's done<br>and i'm not the first professor he's<br>trained by any stretch there's the<br>numerous professors<br>that that he's been training um my other<br>supervisor was<br>uh paul reynolds and paul reynolds<br>worked at dsir which is now plant and<br>food research so it was<br>great to have an opportunity to work<br>both in an academic institute and and a<br>cri and i think that<br>um shaped the way my future career went<br>that collaboration between cri's and<br>universities is really important<br>especially given there's not too many<br>academic<br>plant biologists in the country<br>paul reynolds has gone on to have a<br>stellar career after supervising me<br>so he is chair of the board of<br>agriculture at the moment he was chief<br>executive<br>of the ministry of environment and had<br>numerous<br>uh important roles in science uh<br>leadership so<br>he was i think i've said uh might have<br>not a student of<br>kevin's uh in the department so uh<br>someone that we're very proud of<br>in our department and the role that he's<br>played<br>so my phd was asking kind of a very<br>simple question<br>um legumes are able to fix nitrogen and<br>they do so<br>by making these root nodules<br>and that's made up of plant tissue so<br>somehow the plant is able to<br>express key genes that are able to make<br>these root nodules<br>so how are genes controlled and switched<br>on just in the root nodules<br>to make this important structure was a<br>the question of my phd<br>so here i've got a picture of a gene a<br>gene<br>has a seat region that encodes a protein<br>a transcript<br>will be made messenger rna and that will<br>encode a protein<br>and that will be important in this case<br>for making root nodules<br>and a gene also has regulatory sequences<br>and<br>what i was able to show during my phd<br>was there are certain sequences<br>within a region that is important for<br>expressing that gene just in the root<br>nodules where a transcription factor is<br>able to bind<br>and through making uh transgenic plants<br>i was able to then introduce a mutated<br>version of that where this<br>sequence wasn't there and show that that<br>was the key sequence for turning on the<br>gene and root nodules<br>so i've been making transgenic uh plant<br>for for<br>30 years it's a fundamental tool for<br>what we do and how we understand<br>biology it's not not a new thing<br>as frank said after i finished my phd<br>i was lucky enough to go over and work<br>in the john inner center<br>it's one of the eminent<br>plant research institutes in the world<br>and there's just an amazing number of<br>great scientists working there at the<br>time<br>um in the picture here all this area is<br>glass houses so<br>huge facilities for growing and<br>analyzing plants<br>right next door here it has two uh a<br>cricket field so it was i could just<br>walk out the door<br>of the lab and go and play my evening<br>cricket and thing so it was a tremendous<br>place to<br>place to work uh so my supervisor<br>frank said was was caroline dean she<br>joined the john innes<br>about six years before i uh came along<br>and her husband was also a well-known<br>plant scientist so they turned up at the<br>john innes center<br>wanting to get jobs and had an interview<br>both had interviews<br>and they said to her husband jonathan<br>i'll give you a group leader's job and<br>then said to caroline dean being a woman<br>oh so you want to be a postdoc somewhere<br>do you and she said most<br>firmly uh no way i want to run my own<br>group and<br>uh quite taken aback he the the director<br>there gave her<br>her own group to run um and and she's<br>another one again<br>after supervising me has had a stellar<br>career<br>the other exciting thing at the time<br>that um<br>was that the first genetically modified<br>plants were just coming on stream<br>and so we could really see the potential<br>of our research and how it could be<br>translated<br>into and to new and improved crops so<br>these flavour saver tomatoes were on<br>sale at the supermarket<br>um and fda said concluded about them<br>that they're as safe as tomatoes bred by<br>conventional beans that's how they're<br>allowed<br>and that's true today as it was then<br>after<br>26 years of something of research into<br>genetic modified plants<br>that statement that there are safest<br>crops<br>bred by conventional means as true and<br>so at a time where we're<br>all meant to be trusting the scientists<br>on climate change and<br>you know the fda whether the coronavirus<br>vaccine is going to be safe<br>um we should be listening to the<br>scientists that the genetic modification<br>is safe and it's a tool that we should<br>certainly be taking advantage of given<br>the the need<br>that we have coming up so what caroline<br>dean's lab was working on<br>was how plants know when to flower<br>so when a plant flowers determines that<br>when it produces its fruit or grain<br>so it's a key agricultural trait and<br>something i thought was certainly worthy<br>at the time not a lot was known about<br>the mechanisms<br>of flowering it was known that plants<br>needed many of them<br>prolonged winter cold and then spring<br>long days and that will trigger<br>flowering<br>but exactly how that occurs was not<br>known it was known that there was a<br>hormone made in the leaves<br>that moved up to the apex and that was<br>discovered in 19 or posted in 1936<br>and many many phd students tried to<br>isolate that hormone<br>without any luck at all so there was a<br>lot to learn<br>so the way to go about tackling such a<br>problem is through genetics and i<br>just there like to acknowledge uh<br>russell polter i did second year<br>genetics with him and got passionate<br>about the power<br>of genetics and and and it's wrong<br>i also see paula jamison in the audience<br>too i did botany and she was one of my<br>lecturers and<br>inspired me again uh to do plant biology<br>and so<br>i thank her and she's since we can<br>become a colleague and we've even<br>published papers together so it's<br>lovely how things go around so<br>um what it was decided was that it was<br>better for researchers or one way<br>researchers could tackle a problem is<br>all focus on a single plant rather than<br>looking at their individual plants focus<br>the effort and get the genetic<br>tools and resources available that<br>everyone worldwide could use so they<br>chose arabidopsis<br>a model plant that can easily be grown<br>in the lab and it's been<br>ideal for genetic studies and so the<br>idea was to create mutants<br>and then if you're interested in<br>flowering time and you've got a mutant<br>that's defective and flowering<br>then that gene that's been mutated must<br>have some role in flowering and so but<br>by discovering the gene<br>you should get an insight about how that<br>gene works and and the mechanism in<br>general<br>so i'll talk about um four different<br>genes<br>here that have provided an insight about<br>how flowering occurs<br>there's probably about 100 different<br>genes that some ways affect flowering<br>but<br>here are four key genes which we'll go<br>through<br>so one of those genes and here's a model<br>that was a very simplified model that<br>was established<br>one of those genes is the ft gene<br>and that makes a transcript which<br>encodes a protein<br>ft protein and it turned out after<br>probably 10 years of working on the ft<br>gene that actually that was<br>the oral signal molecule fluorogen so<br>the ft protein itself is made in the<br>leaves<br>moves through the phloem to the apex and<br>triggers flowering so we can think of<br>now as a as a molecular genetics i can<br>think of flowering<br>is really when we turn on this ft gene<br>and so we can go back to thinking about<br>regulatory regions and promoters<br>and so how ft gene is turned on is<br>through<br>competition between two transcription<br>factors two proteins that can bind to<br>the dna<br>and switch a gene on or off and so one<br>of these<br>flc is on at high levels in the autumn<br>and so the plant can't flower in the<br>autumn even though the day lengths are<br>right<br>because it binds to this dna sequence<br>and stops the<br>ft gene being on in the winter this<br>f flc gene is silenced it's not<br>active and so a co gene can be turned on<br>protein made in response to the day<br>length and it can trigger eft<br>and trigger flowering the gene that i<br>was working on was<br>was the fca that turns out to be a<br>regulator of flc<br>so again like many other people around<br>the world and<br>at the john innes center we were trying<br>to clone<br>uh and work out what genes were mutated<br>and particularly mutants i was working<br>on the fca mutant<br>and set about by map-based cloning the<br>gene<br>at that time it was a slow process and<br>the tools for cloning genes were just<br>being established<br>the arabidopsis genome was just being<br>sequenced in the lab next door<br>and so the fca region was one of the<br>first regions of aerobloxes was<br>sequenced so we could discover what<br>genes were there<br>and eventually find out that the fca<br>gene<br>encoded a protein that has rna binding<br>domains and a protein interaction domain<br>so here i've got the fca gene uh<br>schematic of it makes a messenger rna<br>translated to make this protein<br>so what rna does it find what protein<br>might it interact with<br>so a clue to that came again when i was<br>making<br>genetically modified plants i tried to<br>make the cfca gene<br>expressed at very high levels and to my<br>surprise<br>it didn't kind of work and rather than<br>getting the full length transcript being<br>made<br>i got this truncated transcript and what<br>we worked out was<br>that the fca gene is actually able to<br>bind to<br>the messenger rna as it's being made<br>make it shorter and therefore stop too<br>much of this<br>fca protein being made on elegant<br>feedback regulation<br>so the more and more we study genes the<br>more and more we find that the<br>regulation how these genes are switched<br>on and off<br>is tightly controlled and so this is a<br>the fca gene also regulates that<br>repressor of flaring flc<br>as well and when i made again some<br>transgenic plants<br>uh just expressing this transcript i got<br>early flowering<br>and i got early flowering because it was<br>able to turn off<br>this flc gene and<br>working out how fca turns off that flc<br>gene<br>has taken 20 years there's a pub paper<br>now caroline dean has published in pnas<br>just a few months ago that is starting<br>to fill in that last<br>last gap about how it works so it's it's<br>a long process research<br>so what happens to this flc gene<br>is in the autumn it's turned on at high<br>levels and that blocks the ft gene being<br>turned on<br>and in the winter there is a<br>transcription factor that binds to the<br>um flc gene but in a different region<br>and actually makes<br>a transcript in the opposite direction<br>and<br>the fca gene is able to bind to that<br>transcript<br>and recruit a whole lot of proteins to<br>the dna<br>which package that dna in a different<br>way<br>change the histone conformation<br>and that way it's packaged turns the<br>gene off<br>and it turns it off in a way that stays<br>off<br>and that really solves one of the<br>mysteries about how plants remember that<br>they've been in the cold<br>even when you shift them into the warm<br>uh under non<br>and non-inductive conditions they'll<br>just sit there and then minute you put<br>them into longer days they'll flower so<br>they've somehow remembered that they've<br>been<br>in the cold a long time ago and it's um<br>through understanding<br>the way that this dna is packaged that<br>that that was important<br>and they've been about 100 papers<br>relating to it to flc<br>and caroline dean was knighted because<br>of her work and understanding this<br>regulation<br>and she was knighted really because<br>having a fundamental understanding of<br>how genes are regulated<br>is not only important for plants it's<br>important across all areas of plant<br>biology<br>and actually the genetic tools that we<br>could use and can use an arabidopsis<br>meant that she was leading the field and<br>understanding regulation<br>so i contributed a bit to some of this<br>understanding<br>and i'd like to acknowledge becky laurie<br>she did the phd with caroline dean<br>and then had the courage and<br>craziness to then decide to come over to<br>new zealand to be my first postdoc<br>so i'd like to thank her publicly again<br>for all the work that she did and<br>especially starting off<br>uh in the lab and and helping me out and<br>get going uh<br>her work was a tremendous benefit the<br>other person that didn't work on fca but<br>i'd really like to acknowledge<br>is rob day so rob day was one of my<br>first phd students worked on a different<br>topic but<br>um he was passionate about technology<br>and innovation and the way we did our<br>experiments and really led<br>my research forward and subsequently<br>has got into high throughput sequencing<br>and really<br>a benefit across the university making<br>this kind of technology accessible and<br>her and becca in fact have been<br>with leaders early on in zl and our<br>ability to sequencing so<br>um through those two people making a big<br>impact of what<br>okay so how plants uh how do plants<br>flower in the spring<br>so we all know that days get longer um<br>so we're up to<br>the 16th of november uh and we have 15<br>hours of nearly 15 hours of daylight<br>uh compared with the shortest day when<br>we only had eight hours 40 minutes<br>um so day length gets older how to plant<br>scents that increase in day length<br>to trigger flowering in the spring<br>so inside of that came from actually<br>another new zealander joe patrol who<br>cloned<br>and discovered the cog which now<br>professed at auckland university<br>and it was discovered once that gene had<br>been cloned<br>that it oscillated and so that at<br>midday it's very low levels and at<br>midnight<br>it's very high levels and it oscillates<br>you know<br>the same way doesn't throughout the<br>seasons it doesn't change<br>it encodes a protein co protein that<br>happens to be rapidly degraded<br>in the dark so in the winter when<br>there's high levels of this messenger<br>rna<br>it makes a co protein but the co protein<br>is rapidly degraded<br>so it can't it's an a transcription<br>factor that activates ft it's degraded<br>so can't activate ft<br>but when days get long enough then it<br>more of that transcript made during the<br>light<br>and it's stabilized and therefore can<br>activate ft so it's a<br>the coincidence of the way that the<br>messenger rna has been made<br>and the stability of the co protein and<br>the light that allows plants to flower<br>in the spring and that mechanism is<br>really precise you know<br>you'll not all know that plants flower<br>you know the same week<br>every year more or less so it's a<br>so um so a lot was being learned about<br>how flowering occurred in arabidopsis<br>and i wanted to know if the same<br>pathways and the same<br>process happened in other plants and<br>probably because of my phd<br>uh set out studying uh legumes an<br>important<br>family of plants and have collaborated<br>with jim weller university of tasmania<br>for many years he's<br>fantastic scientists on trying to look<br>and see how flowering is regulated in<br>legumes<br>i thought it was going to be quick um<br>and<br>what we learned from arabidopsis would<br>just translate neatly over to legumes<br>but that wasn't the case so<br>the key genes that i've talked about ft<br>is<br>in legumes and actually there's two<br>copies of that but co flc and fca<br>don't play a role in the regulation of<br>flowering<br>so there's this fundamental differences<br>that needed to be uh<br>discovered interesting to discover<br>so again some experiments from from<br>becky lori<br>one of these ft genes was turned on<br>in response to prolonged cold days so<br>the expression level of the gene<br>increases switched on upon cold<br>and were able to get a muta mutant in in<br>this gene<br>and that plant was no longer able to<br>sense the cold and flower in response to<br>the cold<br>so it showed us that the cold is able to<br>directly turn on<br>the ft gene which then triggered<br>flowering<br>and through the work of donna bond<br>we're able to start getting some<br>insights about how this occurs<br>so what it turns out is the ft gene is<br>turned off in the autumn<br>because it has these histone<br>modifications the way it is wrapped up<br>in the dna and what happens in the<br>winter<br>is again a non-coding rna is made and<br>that somehow removes<br>these histone marks and changes the way<br>it's packaged<br>so that in the spring it can be turned<br>on<br>and so it's really interesting that a<br>similar mechanism but opposite mechanism<br>happens compared with arabidopsis one<br>plant has a repressor of flowering<br>which is turned off and legumes have an<br>activator of flowering which is turned<br>on but they still involve these this<br>way it's packaged in the dna and the way<br>it's switched on so<br>evolution is used common mechanisms to<br>solve<br>it gives flower in response to day<br>length as well<br>and when we put<br>the plants into long days we get one of<br>these other this other ft gene<br>being rapidly turned on and so it's<br>it's another trigger for flowering so<br>it's a combination of these two genes<br>that both encode a that determine when<br>legumes flower and the balance of those<br>and and seoul<br>postdoc in my lab has been working on<br>this and other things<br>so to my delight we've now got gene<br>editing working<br>in metacargo uh shireen also helping<br>make these transgenic<br>mini cargo plants not an easy thing and<br>so we've been able to show<br>i think results are just coming that<br>when you knock out this gene<br>you don't uh you're later flowering and<br>showing its key role in flowering<br>but um but having the ability to mutate<br>genes at will through these new<br>technologies of gene editing is really<br>gonna<br>uh push what we can do forward and<br>revolutionize<br>our ability to do this kind of research<br>so it's very exciting<br>um seoul also got a fast start marston<br>so it's very talented talented scientist<br>and she's particularly interested in how<br>the clock works<br>and how that changes in the clock are<br>important for adapting to new<br>environments<br>so we've got some interesting things<br>i was also interested in the<br>domestication of<br>crops and legumes and so we've been<br>eating legumes for for a long time<br>um peas wild peas chickpeas were in the<br>diet<br>that's 23 000 years ago and it was one<br>of the very first crops along with<br>cereals to be domesticated<br>um in the fertile crescent and the<br>domestication<br>of crops requires a number of steps but<br>one of them is<br>changing the way the plant responds to<br>the environment so that you can plant<br>the plants<br>in early spring and then harvest them<br>you know<br>late and summer early some or whatever<br>and so it requires uh identifying<br>uh changes so uh through<br>the work of jim weller that we<br>contributed to um<br>we found that one of these<br>differences between a wild variety of<br>legume and a domesticated variety of<br>legume<br>was the function of this gene l3<br>which works as part of the circadian<br>clock<br>and so mutations in this gene lead to a<br>plant that will flower<br>even if it's not in long days<br>arabidopsis<br>so what's happening is that a mutation<br>in the clock<br>alters the pattern of expression of one<br>of these key genes<br>so that it's expressed earlier in the<br>day and if it's expressed earlier in the<br>day it's made during the light<br>even in winter and will make this stable<br>co protein<br>or whatever that gene protein is to<br>activate flowering and turn on flowering<br>in fact we're yet to discover exactly<br>what that<br>that gene is but we know how it behaves<br>so so you can think of um<br>and i think of uh the advent of<br>civilization and moving<br>slowly over time from establishing<br>agriculture and the fertile crescent<br>through europe<br>is a process of waiting for for<br>flowering time mutants<br>so these key mutations that<br>labeled agriculture in new areas and<br>plants become adapted to new areas<br>slowly happened and slowly were<br>discovered as part of domestication and<br>that's<br>part of the reason why the move uh you<br>know took sort of six thousand years for<br>civilization to move<br>and the mutation in the l3 gene was<br>key to moving further north and northern<br>europe<br>and so getting up into that area was was<br>waiting for an fl<br>an l3 mutant<br>and an l3 mutant was found allowing<br>pease to be cultivated there and lentils<br>to be cultivated<br>in northern europe um in<br>chickpeas there happens to be two of<br>three genes<br>so the chance random chance of knocking<br>out both those<br>are too small so no one's that never<br>occurred in nature<br>this gene was never mutated both copies<br>never mutated to get early flowering<br>so other gene in fact an ft gene was<br>mutated<br>um which illustrates that now our<br>knowledge of<br>how we can change flowering time and<br>what genes to could be disrupted<br>can provide a way of breeding a new a<br>new chickpea<br>unfortunately with climate change the<br>seasons are getting shorter it's getting<br>hotter<br>earlier and so we need varieties that<br>mature more quickly<br>and so if we can use gene editing to<br>knock out both copies of the l3 gene<br>we will get a earlier maturing um<br>chickpea allowing it to grow into new<br>locations so<br>so this knowledge is going to be it's<br>going to be really useful<br>i want to turn my attention now to<br>another another story in the lab<br>um those are looking at onion bulban and<br>again<br>it's similar um people at<br>and john mccollum at plant and food<br>research and the and onion growers<br>we're really interested in understanding<br>how plant becomes adapted<br>um to new areas and how you can breed um<br>an onion suited to the right conditions<br>and there was a particular problem with<br>with premature flowering<br>some wise man said once that to be a<br>great onion<br>you need to be adapted to your<br>environment and so<br>onions grown in more tropical areas<br>where the day length differences are<br>shorter will flower with just<br>10 12 hours of day length will trigger<br>trigger bulb formation so an onion bulb<br>formation is caused by<br>changes in daylight whereas<br>if you grew a onion in dunedin then uh<br>it will form a bulb after 14 hours of<br>daily so you need different varieties<br>for different regions matched to their<br>location<br>so there's different types of breeds<br>needed<br>so what underlies the difference between<br>those breeds and you certainly can't<br>grow<br>a short day onion and dunedin it will<br>form a bulb way too<br>small bulb and and flower prematurely<br>and it'll be a disaster<br>so um so what is the difference<br>so we set about to try and understand um<br>the process of<br>flouring an onion and and advertising<br>probably bulb formation and onion and<br>and here i'd like to acknowledge the<br>work of robin lee in my lab<br>uh robin's worked for me for 10 years<br>slightly over 10 years now<br>and basically runs the lab and i really<br>couldn't do without her and<br>her help with the supervising the<br>students and and and helping her is<br>absolutely<br>crucial so to be able to keep her in the<br>lab in a pressure of keeping getting<br>money is<br>as luckily come through but certainly<br>without these these key individuals<br>you would struggle because i was working<br>on<br>onions giffen who had a family farm in<br>india growing onions<br>came and wanted to work with me as do a<br>phd so he<br>has been a tremendous asset he's now<br>gone back to a university position in<br>india<br>and mo who also worked on the project is<br>now<br>a breeder in pukakoi onion breeder so<br>i'm very proud that the skills that<br>they've been learning are now<br>have some more practical use and john<br>mccullum<br>there's not a man on earth that's more<br>passionate about onions so<br>uh using some of this high throughput<br>sequencing technology<br>in fact uh in joe stanton's machine<br>and anatomy right in the early days<br>we're able to uh<br>sequence the g the messenger rna from<br>onions and<br>for the first time try and work out what<br>genes were doing what<br>and what we discovered was that there<br>was an ft gene<br>that triggered flowering so that wasn't<br>surprising but what we were surprised at<br>there was an ft<br>gene that triggered bulb formation so an<br>onion<br>then uh ft is the hormone that triggers<br>bulb formation<br>and when we made a genetically modified<br>onion that could do it in in<br>lincoln uh for us we got to our surprise<br>onion bowls forming straight away right<br>in tissue culture so that was a very<br>exciting day when we<br>we saw those um proving that that ft<br>gene really does<br>uh turn on bold formation so what's<br>happened in evolution is has been kind<br>of<br>a split of the pathway duplication of<br>these<br>two ft genes one keeping the day length<br>perception role but then turning on to<br>do something different turn on and make<br>bulbs whereas others<br>one is just turned on in the cold and<br>triggers triggers flowering<br>so we've been working away trying to<br>understand the other steps in the<br>pathway and what the genes encode and<br>how<br>how these all work and the key thing<br>we're trying to discover is really<br>what is the difference between an onion<br>adapted to one region<br>and a different region and so you know<br>amazingly<br>in tropical regions we the ft two gene<br>is turned on with about 20 degrees<br>there's a vernalization period for an<br>onion a cold period<br>whereas we need sort of four degrees of<br>a new zealand onion so how how<br>the plants respond to different<br>temperatures of cold how they respond to<br>different changes in day length and how<br>that's occurred<br>uh is what we're wanting to work out now<br>hopefully some stage will be able to<br>tell the breeders<br>what genes to um to breed and to get<br>okay so um the other story i want<br>another story i wanted i'm probably<br>running out of time a little bit never<br>mind<br>um is a vitamin c production and so<br>again it was through a collaboration<br>with plant and food research<br>and i've got a couple of students<br>matthew and erin who did some of the<br>work that i'll talk about<br>the thing about vitamin c as a little<br>nutritional fact for you<br>that vitamin c helps you absorb iron<br>and iron deficiency is a major problem<br>around the world so i think if we can<br>breed crops that have higher<br>vitamin c production at vitamin c levels<br>it will be a tool to<br>help people uptake more iron from their<br>diet<br>and probably need to do that as we eat<br>less meat and more vegetables and<br>fruit okay<br>so through the work of plant and food<br>then they found that uh that worked out<br>the pathway for vitamin c production and<br>they knew this<br>this enzyme here just call it ggp is<br>key rate limiting step in the pathway so<br>here i've got the gene uh making this<br>enzyme which makes vitamin c<br>and a bit like the example i had with<br>the fca<br>that flowering time gene that was<br>regulated in a feedback loop<br>what we've found was that<br>in the case of this gene is that there<br>is a<br>sequence upstream that actually encodes<br>a little peptide<br>that when there's high levels of vitamin<br>c we think<br>uh some evidence that vitamin c actually<br>binds to this peptide stops the<br>translation<br>stops therefore this downstream protein<br>being made<br>and therefore reducing vitamin c so an<br>elegant feedback mechanism to make sure<br>you have the right levels of vitamin c<br>in the plant<br>some plants though have huge levels of<br>vitamin c tremendous levels of vitamin c<br>uh in these superfruits hundred times<br>that of<br>an orange for example and there's this<br>non-commercial kiwifruit variety again<br>has 20 times the level<br>so we're really interested in<br>understanding how that's happened<br>and gain rna sequencing there's one tool<br>that we've used to try and figure out<br>what's going on<br>and it turns out that they have<br>extremely high levels of these<br>these messenger iron encoding these key<br>enzymes in the pathway<br>and so what we think is probably there<br>is some factor transcription factor<br>that's turned on at high levels<br>that can turn on all these genes and<br>we've also shown that there are changes<br>not complete mutations but changes in<br>the way this feedback<br>regulation works to allow more of the<br>um the enzyme being made even when<br>there's reasonably high levels of<br>vitamin c<br>and using that knowledge and gene<br>editing we've been able to create<br>arabidopsis plants that have<br>three times more vitamin c by mutating<br>that regulatory sequence<br>and we've got genetically modified<br>tomatoes that have five times more<br>vitamin c by doing both<br>turning on the gene actually just in the<br>fruit and not having this feedback<br>regulation<br>so that's the highest vitamin sea level<br>that's been found in a<br>in a tomato but still not near<br>where the limits are so i think there's<br>other feedback regulation going on that<br>we need to discover to get it even<br>higher but this<br>certainly would make a big difference if<br>we could<br>okay finally i want to talk about<br>the work that we're doing with ryegrass<br>so this is the<br>father-in-law's farm with beautiful rye<br>grass growing<br>just over the prior to a track from<br>on the other side on my side of the<br>family there is some farming in there<br>had to delve a wee way to find some some<br>farming in<br>my side of the family and i'll talk<br>about my uh great grandfather<br>who was born in 1819 in scotland<br>and he studied at edinburgh university<br>and then<br>aged 22 um set sail for<br>australia arrived in port phillips and<br>bought a farm and ended up specialising<br>in breeding breeding short horned cattle<br>and merino sheep there<br>and became quite an expert breeder and<br>was um<br>intrigued about the value of inbreeding<br>he thought that there was huge value in<br>breeding and the way that they bred and<br>even wrote books on<br>books on breeding when published on the<br>true principles of breeding<br>there was another child who was also<br>interested in in breeding a wee bit more<br>famous i know<br>uh he was born ten years earlier than my<br>great-grandfather um but<br>charles darwin also studied at ambrose<br>university also went on a voyage<br>gained a little bit more famous and<br>again wrote a book<br>on uh breeding the very variation in<br>animals<br>and and plants under domestication and<br>um<br>in that book uh very pleased to see that<br>he<br>referenced a couple of my great<br>grandfather's works and and this book<br>so what charles darwin had noticed and<br>cessna<br>says in that book is he noticed there<br>were two types of plants<br>some plants which naturally<br>self-pollinate so that they inbreed<br>and some plants that naturally outcross<br>and can't inbreed<br>and a couple of years after writing that<br>book he also noted that plants that<br>outcross<br>have greater height weight fertility<br>than their self-fertile<br>counterparts so um there's actually<br>advantages of both breeding strategies<br>uh the advantage of a pure breeding line<br>is that purebred and you can whatever<br>you plant is going to be uniform<br>whereas an outcrossing plant you end up<br>with a mixture of phenotypes mixture of<br>plants<br>but there is this potential to get get<br>this hybrid vigor<br>as it's called and<br>combining the advantage of those two<br>breeding systems<br>has really been one of the reasons why<br>we fed the world<br>the ability to in maize and rice and<br>many other crops<br>to inbreed plants so you get nice<br>uniform<br>plant and then out cross them<br>so that you get take advantage of this<br>hybrid vigor<br>but then all the seeds because these two<br>lines are in bread are genetically<br>uniform<br>allows this high quality f1 hybrid seed<br>that<br>that you can plant<br>and here we show the results and yellow<br>is when they started to use<br>these hybrid varieties and it provides a<br>way of really accelerating the selection<br>of breeding and<br>led to this tremendous gain and yield<br>unfortunately in ryegrass yield gain has<br>been a real struggle because it's<br>uh because it's an outcrosser and<br>you end up with a population of plants<br>and and actually some of the leading<br>varieties<br>just talked to a breeder on friday about<br>and he was saying that in<br>one of the leading varieties that they<br>still sell he bred<br>uh in 2000 so 20 year old varieties are<br>still the leader so they really aren't<br>making the gains<br>that uh we'd like them to and so<br>um have a project a collaboration with<br>with brownfield who's in<br>i share a lab within the biochemistry<br>department<br>rowan a talented postdoc who actually<br>did a phd with me first i mean cold<br>spring harbor has got excellent training<br>others in the lab shiny caitlin doing a<br>phd student smart<br>who's another postdoc in the lab and<br>we're together trying to<br>use our knowledge that we've gained from<br>and<br>the world has gained from studying these<br>other cereals<br>rice etc and how they work and applying<br>it to<br>ryegrass to enhance the breeding and so<br>what we're working on is an f1 hybrid<br>breeding system where you can<br>get self-fertile plants convert ryegrass<br>to be self-fertile so you can inbreed<br>and then switch them to outcross so you<br>can take advantage of this hybrid vigor<br>we have another project that's involved<br>in trying to prevent flowering on the<br>field<br>in the field because that increases<br>production<br>and just induced flowering for seed<br>production<br>so this huge potential i end really this<br>in my last last slide and saying<br>there's huge potential in using our<br>knowledge that we've gained from<br>understanding how<br>how genes work and um these systems to<br>apply them to crop plants to enhance<br>production<br>and back to my point that we really are<br>going to need to make these advances<br>if we're going to continue to have a<br>productive agricultural sector without<br>having<br>you know increased land and pollution<br>and on this project i'm pleased to be<br>working with seed companies ag research<br>otago innovation mb uh all funding some<br>of this work which uh<br>which is really exciting and finally<br>um too many to mention but all i'd like<br>to thank all the students that worked<br>with me and for me over the years and<br>other people that worked in the lab<br>and i'm sorry that i've used more time<br>talking about it than i should have<br>talking about all this<br>all the work that's going on but i<br>haven't only touched the surface of and<br>and have been able to talk about many<br>many contributions to many people and<br>i've worked with<br>with people throughout new zealand uh<br>and<br>and and elsewhere and this work and as<br>frank said us<br>very lucky to be funded for many years<br>by the master fund<br>so thank you very much<br>cool everyone i'm sally mccormick the<br>hod of bike him<br>and it's my job i've got the easier job<br>of thanking richard<br>tonight so na mihi richard<br>thank you for giving us that wonderful<br>insight<br>into your research endeavors over the<br>last 20 or more years<br>those of you that have avid gardeners<br>will know the importance of the right<br>timing of flowering um but of course<br>richard has dissected that right down to<br>the<br>molecular level understanding the genes<br>and the pathways involved<br>and now having the ability to use that<br>knowledge to be able to manipulate<br>flowering in a whole range of plants<br>and so that has huge potential along<br>with the<br>vitamin c work he's mentioned to enhance<br>nutrition<br>nutritional valuable value of plants<br>you can see how that might have<br>global implications so great stuff<br>i just wanted to touch on a couple of<br>things<br>with richard i think has been it's quite<br>unique to<br>two qualities i think quite unique and<br>and they've come through<br>both in his talk and with frank and<br>talking about him is one is ability to<br>engage in new technologies<br>and um i think that's been<br>true all the way through in fact i was<br>reading one of the referees reports for<br>his<br>job application in 2001<br>and it stated that he was the best<br>cloner<br>that had ever been in the lab i suspect<br>that was from caroline<br>now cloning wasn't new back in the late<br>1990s but it was<br>certainly very very difficult and these<br>days we<br>we have kits that make it a lot easier<br>so<br>clearly you know technically apt and has<br>maintained that engagement and new<br>technologies as they've come<br>come aboard so there's been a lot of new<br>gene technologies come aboard in the<br>last<br>last 10 20 years and he's engaged in<br>just about every one of them<br>the the next gene next generation<br>sequencing<br>mike ray's before that the gene editing<br>that is available now<br>and he's made sure that all of his lab<br>people are very well trained in those<br>technologies the other important quality<br>i think he's shown and again right from<br>the very start<br>his foresight to engage with the end<br>users<br>of his research so the cris plant and<br>food the plant breeders<br>right from the very start he has had<br>engaged with them and has had some very<br>uh fruitful and long-standing um<br>collaborations with them to<br>to this very day and i think those two<br>things have<br>uh and many other things have come<br>together just to<br>ensure that he has had very<br>long-standing stream of funding and<br>frank alluded to this both from the<br>basic hand<br>of funding right through to the applied<br>contracts with plant breeders and things<br>so<br>we are very proud of you richard and we<br>are very happy<br>that biochemistry is your home<br>you have had a long stream of of<br>students<br>coming into your lab more than most and<br>again i think that<br>also plays to your your role of being a<br>very passionate and engaging teacher<br>students love you and they want to be<br>working with you<br>so with any no further ado<br>uh big congrats and i think under here<br>we have a week gift<br>so i'm i'm now the acting pro vice<br>chancellor for health sciences<br>and um to finish off this evening i'd<br>like to echo<br>sally's thanks to richard mcknight that<br>was a really tremendous talk i<br>thoroughly enjoyed it i shall<br>check my garden more thoroughly in<br>future<br>and i'd like to thank everybody in the<br>audience for coming to this<br>wonderful talk and i'd now like to<br>invite you all over to the staff club<br>for refreshments<br>and the ability to talk to each other<br>and to talk to richard<br>and to talk to his wide family so thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
