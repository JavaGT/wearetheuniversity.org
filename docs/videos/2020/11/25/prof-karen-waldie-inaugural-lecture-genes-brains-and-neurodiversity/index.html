Recorded on 24 November 2020.<br><br>This talk is divided into segments that pertain to particular stages of Karenâ€™s research life. While taking us through the early years of functional magnetic resonance imaging, molecular genetics, and National longitudinal studies, she attempts to answer some of the big questions in the area of  developmental cognitive neuroscience. Are dyslexia and ADHD real? How do children with dyslexia turn out years later? Do behavioural problems persist?<br>Is there a migraine personality? How do genes and environments interact? What is neuroplasticity?

hosking i'm dean of<br>science here at the university of<br>auckland<br>it's my very great pleasure to welcome<br>you to the inaugural lecture of karen<br>waldy<br>karen was born in victoria bc canada<br>received her bsc<br>at the university of victoria that's the<br>bc one<br>she gained an msc and phd at the<br>university of calgary where she met her<br>kiwi husband<br>they moved to new zealand and karen<br>worked with the world famous dunedin<br>study before joining us here in auckland<br>in the school of psychology<br>karen's research interests can be<br>broadly categorised into those that rely<br>on acute cross-sectional experimental<br>techniques<br>and those which rely on data collected<br>from longitudinal studies<br>their experimental work combines<br>techniques from cognitive<br>neuroscience such as functional magnetic<br>resonance imaging or fmri<br>and eeg with clinical neuropsychology<br>this is designed for to make deans trip<br>up as they read words<br>clearly for example she's been able to<br>show<br>brain-based differences between<br>neurotypicals and individuals with<br>dyslexia<br>must help the ministry of education to<br>formally recognize dyslexia in 2008<br>seems like an incredibly short time ago<br>she's currently leading a large fmri<br>study to determine the<br>neural basis of dyslexia dyscalculia<br>and adhd her involvement with national<br>longitudinal studies<br>the dunedin study auckland birthright<br>collaborative study<br>and growing up in new zealand reflect<br>reflects her interests in lifespan<br>development<br>as well as the precursors and<br>determinants of neurodevelopmental<br>disorders<br>in simple terms as karen put it when she<br>was interviewed<br>for our local rag karen studies the<br>predictors and causes of problem<br>behaviour and cognitive problem and<br>problems in kids karen's going to tell<br>us more about this<br>in her talk this evening so please join<br>me<br>in welcoming professor karen waldy<br>i'd like to begin by spending a few<br>minutes explaining<br>what i mean by neurodiversity includes<br>these developmental disorders<br>dyslexia dyscalculia attention deficit<br>hyperactivity disorder<br>and autism spectrum disorder<br>i'm interested in the cognitive and<br>biological markers of these conditions<br>and here i list the main cognitive<br>impairment for each<br>now i just want to stress i want to<br>emphasize that these are only considered<br>disorders because our modern society<br>values literacy numeracy<br>sustained attention and social skills<br>i have no sense of direction<br>but my getting lost is not considered a<br>disability<br>i'm interested in comorbidity<br>and mental health because developmental<br>disorders rarely occur<br>alone and i include this figure<br>to remind us that asd sits on a gradient<br>a spectrum from low functioning to very<br>high functioning<br>but this is true for all cognitive<br>functions and dysfunctions<br>a diagnosis involves a relatively<br>arbitrary categorical cutoff<br>along a continuum of ability<br>and finally developmental disorders are<br>due to differences in brain structure<br>and function<br>they're all influenced by both nature<br>and<br>nurture and parents would do anything<br>to help their kids navigate our modern<br>society<br>this is the list of topics that i hope<br>to cover tonight<br>and they represent a chronology of the<br>past 22 years<br>but before i begin i want to make some<br>important acknowledgements<br>and take you through a little bit of my<br>early<br>life that might be a bit relevant i'd<br>like to<br>acknowledge the faculty of science in<br>particular<br>for funding so much of my brain imaging<br>research<br>and my students and i would not be here<br>tonight<br>notable colleagues mike corbilis<br>ed mitchell john thompson sir richard<br>fall<br>my dunedin study group anna wilson<br>my minds for mine's colleagues susan<br>morton<br>zealand<br>professor ian kirk is<br>my husband and colleague and we met<br>in canada through a mutual love of<br>neuroscience<br>and we have produced 23 research<br>articles together<br>we have produced this little boy zachary<br>and i want to acknowledge him for being<br>such a good<br>sport over the years he has spat into<br>tubes<br>for genetic testing he's been a a<br>subject a pilot subject for brain<br>experiments and brain<br>training training<br>and to my coffee group and other friends<br>here tonight<br>in vancouver bc and raised in victoria<br>vancouver island<br>and my name is karen but i'm considering<br>changing it<br>to karina because 2020 has not<br>to introduce my background i have taken<br>a few slides from my psych 326<br>course on adoption studies<br>because i am adopted so my wonderful<br>parents wanted six kids<br>but they could only have one my sister<br>jody<br>they adopted my brother three years<br>later<br>and then me four years after that<br>and my biological parents dave and lexi<br>they were high school sweethearts and<br>they had me<br>during their first year of university<br>they went on to get married and have two<br>boys of their own<br>drew and reed and i met them all<br>in my early twenties and i continue to<br>have a<br>a good relationship with them so back to<br>my slides<br>and two points from adoption studies<br>despite how i look here i love my<br>siblings<br>my sister and brother in the early years<br>we shared the same<br>interests and activities and<br>characteristics but<br>as we got older there were differences<br>apparent so for example my sister jody<br>she's a hippie domestic goddess who<br>grows<br>and secondly my biological mother<br>here lexi we are extremely similar<br>um she did her graduate studies in<br>microbiology<br>and here is my beloved mom betty late<br>mom betty so although she was<br>very different from me she was my<br>absolute rock<br>so i did my bsc at the university of<br>victoria and at the same time<br>i was a caregiver at queen alexander<br>hospital for children<br>um i did my honors thesis with the late<br>professor<br>oatfeed spreen and he was a very<br>well-known neurophycologist<br>he wrote many textbooks and neuropsych<br>tests<br>and he was given a lifetime achievement<br>award<br>at the 36th annual meeting of the ins<br>society in hawaii<br>and here i was there luckily<br>i'm here with mike corbless and my<br>for my honors thesis i was introduced to<br>the wonderful world of prospective<br>longitudinal studies<br>and they are the gold standard way that<br>we understand and study human<br>development<br>and outfreed started this study<br>in 1976 and he<br>followed learning disabled children as<br>they grew up<br>and back then we used the label learning<br>disabilities<br>to mean reading disabilities and always<br>interested in why<br>some children with learning disabilities<br>continued to have significant<br>police contact at age 25<br>and what we found was certain<br>characteristics such as<br>impulsivity and poor judgment<br>made these individuals more susceptible<br>to persisting delinquency<br>and these characteristics go into<br>self-control and important research from<br>the canadian study found<br>that self-control predicts health wealth<br>for my graduate studies i moved to<br>calgary alberta<br>and did my msc and phd with<br>professor emeritus larry mosley<br>i did my msc in the area of cognitive<br>psychology<br>but for my phd i wanted to do something<br>a bit different<br>i happened to attend a basics conference<br>where the very famous mike kazanega<br>presented<br>a talk on his split brain patient<br>research<br>and what he told us is that the left<br>hemisphere<br>is dominant it holds our oral language<br>capabilities and because of this<br>he says the right hemisphere is boring<br>he said that he would never go on a date<br>so i'm quite keen on the underdog<br>so i spent my phd trying to determine<br>what the right hemisphere can do<br>so i looked at hemispheric<br>specialization for reading<br>in typical readers of all different ages<br>and i also recruited 45 children<br>with dyslexia from a specialized school<br>called foothills academy<br>and i also became clinically qualified<br>and spent a one-year internship<br>ian and i moved to dunedin new zealand<br>just for one year as he was working on<br>an<br>and always finding it fairly difficult<br>i was fresh out of a phd and<br>trying and failing to get funding for my<br>dyslexia research<br>and the ministry of education hadn't<br>formally recognized dyslexia<br>as a real disorder of reading at this<br>time<br>meanwhile the dunedin multi-disciplinary<br>health and development study<br>was advertising for a biostatistician<br>for their age 26 assessment<br>and though i had certainly heard of this<br>world famous study<br>i didn't really consider myself a<br>statistician<br>but i got the job and i have not<br>regretted it<br>at all it is the richest archive the<br>world will have<br>on human development<br>and i was also introduced to the<br>fascinating area<br>of how early life influences like<br>sunlight exposure can impact on child<br>development<br>and somehow i also became a migraine<br>expert<br>here i list some of the main<br>characteristics of migraine<br>and for about three years i<br>wrote papers on self-perceived health<br>status in migranters<br>the physical and psychological<br>correlates of migraine<br>and the cognitive correlates of migraine<br>and in this paper here my co-authors<br>marcus helsmann<br>and berry mill and we found evidence<br>that there<br>is something that we call a migraine<br>personality<br>so migraine is related to a history of<br>stress<br>stress reactive and harm avoidance<br>personality traits<br>a history of anxiety and late onset<br>depression<br>in 2001 i got a job as a lecturer<br>at the university of auckland and i was<br>fortunate to remain an associate<br>investigator with the dunedin study<br>so when spelled new zealand asked me to<br>speak at their upcoming agm<br>i was able to speak on the topic of how<br>do children with dyslexia<br>so earlier dunedin study researchers had<br>found<br>seven percent of the cohort were<br>identified as having serious reading<br>impairments<br>and i looked at a variety of outcomes<br>and compared<br>these two groups at age 26<br>those with dyslexia were significantly<br>less likely to have achieved a<br>bachelor's degree<br>and they were making much less income<br>per year<br>at age 32 almost half of them hadn't<br>achieved school qualifications<br>and they were still making about ten<br>thousand dollars<br>and they were over represented in the<br>lower<br>ses groups and underrepresented<br>in the higher social socioeconomic<br>groups<br>at age 45 hot off the press again<br>you've got those with dyslexia over<br>represented<br>in the lower ses categories and<br>underrepresented in the higher economic<br>groups<br>with regard to psychological problems<br>again we found<br>some differences with those with<br>dyslexia<br>having a greater likelihood of conduct<br>disorder symptoms<br>more likely to feel stress reactivity<br>feelings of alienation<br>and aggression and<br>significantly more likely to be<br>diagnosed with an anxiety<br>disorder so the bottom line<br>is early identification and intervention<br>is crucial in order to in reduce the<br>likelihood of these disorders<br>so in my first few years at the<br>university of auckland some important<br>things happened<br>one of them was that i was fortunate to<br>join the auckland birth weight<br>collaborative<br>longitudinal study founded by professor<br>ed mitchell<br>and i got involved in a study at about<br>the age seven<br>assessment and i've been mostly<br>interested in<br>early predictors of depression adhd<br>problem behavior and iq<br>and for example here in a study led by<br>rebecca schleckerman we found that<br>maternal stress<br>during pregnancy is associated with<br>moderate to severe<br>depression in 11 year old children<br>particularly if they're born small for<br>gestational age<br>in another study led by john thompson we<br>found<br>that paracetamol taken during pregnancy<br>increased the likelihood of symptoms of<br>adhd<br>and problem behavior at ages 7 and 11<br>years<br>but these are adverse environments how<br>about genetics<br>i started getting interested in<br>molecular genetics<br>about the same time that the dunedin<br>studies started to<br>publish some really important candidate<br>gene<br>studies so for example they found<br>a single nucleotide polymorphism<br>on the serotonin transporter gene<br>increased the likelihood<br>of depression in another study<br>they found that carriers of a cult gene<br>were more likely to develop<br>schizophrenia<br>if they smoked cannabis during<br>adolescence<br>so those of us in the abc study thought<br>this was pretty cool<br>and we see and so we jumped on the<br>genetics bandwagon<br>we looked at the da one transporter gene<br>and its association with both adhd and<br>depression<br>we looked at the comp gene which<br>regulates the catecholamines in the<br>prefrontal cortex<br>and its links to adhd<br>and iq and the brain-derived<br>neurotrophic factor gene<br>and its association with iq<br>but the important point here is that of<br>gene environment<br>interactions so for example in that<br>dunedin study research i pointed out<br>earlier<br>the probability of depression was only<br>significant<br>when there was a history of maltreatment<br>was matched<br>by one or both of the serotonin risk<br>genes and for<br>us in the abc study we found that<br>children born small for gestational age<br>were more likely to have depression<br>symptoms if they had a certain variant<br>and again for children born small for<br>gestational age<br>we found a protective effect in this<br>study<br>we found fewer adhd symptoms<br>if they were carriers of a certain one<br>genotype<br>and finally maternal smoking during<br>pregnancy<br>resulted in offspring<br>with iqs on average four points<br>less and<br>that's in comparison to mothers who<br>weren't smokers<br>and the effect more than doubled if they<br>were met carriers of the bdnf<br>gene so that's eight iq points which is<br>more than half a standard deviation<br>below the mean<br>so a second important thing happened<br>in my first few years at the university<br>of auckland<br>i started teaching developmental<br>psychology<br>and i stood up at the front of the class<br>and i<br>said that we're born with a hundred<br>billion brain cells<br>and that's all we're gonna get<br>i also said that it's really only in the<br>first few years of life<br>that stimulation and the environment can<br>impact on the developing child<br>the rest of the time the brain's kind of<br>static<br>well we know that's not true<br>um in part thanks to sir richard falls<br>research<br>on neurogenesis we create new brain<br>cells<br>throughout the lifespan and our<br>brains continue to change and make new<br>connections<br>throughout adulthood so what is<br>neuroplasticity<br>it's the capacity of the brain to rewire<br>through experience and this figure shows<br>how this rewiring can happen so<br>we're born the brain over produces<br>both neurons and their connections<br>and then we go through a long period of<br>pruning<br>of progressive synapse elimination<br>where only the strongest connections<br>remain<br>and i think about the the brain before<br>pruning<br>as being like a a dense forest with<br>neuroplasticity allows the brain to be<br>responsive<br>to experiences and i've already taken<br>you through some examples of how this<br>can be a negative thing<br>but it can also be a positive thing<br>and one of the most striking examples of<br>this that i found<br>are those who have had a hemispherectomy<br>so mike corbulus took a few of us along<br>to meet<br>four individuals in the auckland region<br>two who had had a complete left<br>hemispherectomy<br>in infancy and two who'd had a right<br>hemispherectomy<br>and the important thing is that they<br>were all living relatively<br>independently and you would not know to<br>talk to them<br>that they only had half a brain<br>neuroplasticity also allows our brain to<br>benefit from stimulation<br>so it can change from playing a musical<br>instrument<br>and through cognitive intervention<br>and gergica for her phd and haymi for<br>her masters<br>asked the question how about learning a<br>new language<br>and what we found this panel are<br>monolinguals these are bilinguals<br>using their native language and this is<br>bilinguals<br>using their second language english<br>and what we found compared to<br>monolinguals<br>a more extensive neural network in<br>bilinguals when processing they're doing<br>lexical decisions<br>in english and also their native<br>language so we found support for the<br>idea<br>there's also some research suggesting<br>that there's a cognitive advantage to<br>bilingualism<br>so switching between languages can<br>enhance<br>cognitive activation and processing<br>and we found a bit of support for this<br>in an fmri study with a bilingual woman<br>who was dyslexic in both her languages<br>but to look at this further i had my<br>colleague leida tomic come from brazil<br>and she spent a year in my lab we did<br>multiple<br>eeg experiments and we collected data<br>from monolinguals<br>bilinguals monolingual dyslexics and<br>bilingual dyslexics and so watch this<br>space<br>and finally a plastic brain can allow<br>the brain<br>to compensate what areas are not<br>functioning<br>optimally so for example in the case of<br>dyslexia<br>and in our first few years as a lecturer<br>our group with a group that won a vice<br>chancellor's development fund award<br>and it allowed us to go to melbourne to<br>the brain research institute<br>to do functional magnetic resonance<br>imaging<br>and at that time we did not have an fmri<br>scanner<br>in new zealand and<br>always interested in language and so<br>typical readers we found in the left<br>hemisphere<br>two areas of maximal up maximal<br>activation a more<br>forward inferior frontal gyrus active<br>activity and a more posterior<br>left temporal cortex activation<br>and in dyslexia we found a lack<br>of that left temporal lobe activity<br>and it was a first for new zealand<br>but internationally it wasn't a first so<br>this figure<br>shows a review study<br>showing nine studies all finding this<br>lack of that posterior left hemisphere<br>language<br>activity during language tasks<br>but that's not what i really found<br>interesting what i found<br>interesting was this this increased<br>activity<br>in the right inferior frontal lobe<br>so the right hemisphere is trying to<br>help out it's compensating<br>but it's having a bit of a hard time<br>because the right hemisphere<br>isn't really specialized for language it<br>likes<br>information presented simultaneously<br>rather than sequentially<br>but a good result of this outcome<br>is that it did convince the ministry of<br>education<br>to finally formally recognize this<br>dyslexia<br>as a real disorder in 2007<br>in 2009 we did another fmri experiment<br>this time in auckland<br>and um we looked at shapes<br>we didn't find any group differences in<br>non-verbal activity<br>we looked at different types of words i<br>wanted to kind of look at the<br>orthographic areas of the brain and the<br>phonological<br>areas of the brain<br>and here for dyslexia again<br>we found this significant right<br>hemisphere<br>activation significant as the cognitive<br>and phonological task demands increased<br>so for the last fmri experiment in 2012<br>we decided to focus on that on a<br>phonological task<br>so our colleague sally sherwood sent us<br>a rhyming task<br>and this fmri experiment was part of a<br>larger<br>auckland comorbidity study that i did<br>with anna wilson<br>and we did a fantasy correlation<br>technique thanks to rhys roberts and our<br>aim was to determine<br>the relationship between activation and<br>and here is our outcome so what we found<br>is a main effect of condition<br>we didn't find a group by condition<br>interaction<br>so for all our participants we found<br>this significant<br>left hemisphere activity in inferior<br>frontal cortex<br>but this is what's really interesting as<br>expected<br>for typical readers as that activity<br>increased<br>so did their task performance on a<br>phoneme reversal task<br>in contrast for those dyslexia as<br>the activity in the left hemisphere<br>increased<br>so we also looked at activation outside<br>of that traditional language network<br>and we found activity in<br>the bilateral temporal lobes<br>and in the insula and in the left panels<br>is the phoneme reversal task and in the<br>right a word attack<br>task so they're sounding out nonsense<br>words<br>and as expected um this compensatory<br>activity<br>wasn't really helping typical readers on<br>the tasks<br>but it certainly was for those with<br>dyslexia<br>and this is these areas here the<br>temporal lobe<br>and then the insula tucked in here<br>with connections to the frontal lobe and<br>so reading performance is mediated by a<br>different network<br>in people with dyslexia possibly due to<br>a genetic vulnerability<br>to atypical left hemisphere wiring<br>but there's also some research<br>suggesting<br>that the corpus callosum is also<br>atypical<br>and we found some suggestive research<br>that this is true we looked at<br>inter-hemispheric transfer time<br>and for adult adults it takes about 12<br>milliseconds<br>for words to go across the corpus<br>callosum<br>for individuals born without a corpus<br>callosum<br>it takes over a minute because the<br>information has to go through a<br>different<br>route and for children with dyslexia<br>about 40 milliseconds so significantly<br>longer<br>than adults typical readers<br>so watch this space again something i'd<br>like to do in the future<br>so adhd most of the research has been<br>focused on the prefrontal lobe with mri<br>showing reduced density and fmri<br>and pet studies showing decreased blood<br>flow<br>during executive functioning tasks such<br>as these<br>and hopefully this looks familiar<br>i used a lexical decision task and<br>this involved decision making and it<br>produced a lot of<br>frontal lobe activity in typical readers<br>so<br>in the cingulate gyrus but for those<br>with adhd<br>we don't see that activity it's under<br>active because of neurotransmitter<br>dopamine and norepinephrine depletion<br>and that's one reason why stimulant<br>drugs such as dexamphetamine<br>and ritalin work they normalize the<br>frontal cortex and increase the<br>activation<br>adhd is also one of the most highly<br>heritable<br>of our conditions and<br>again in the abc study we found that<br>maternal stress during pregnancy<br>increases the risk of adhd<br>symptoms and poor behavior and that<br>effect<br>doubled if they were met homozygotes<br>and adhd symptoms are also<br>very stable so only about 20 percent of<br>them completely outgrow<br>adhd symptoms<br>but in the younger years the symptoms of<br>problem behavior are less<br>stable so behavioral problems<br>can present as early as two but they<br>typically don't<br>persist and dr steph de souba<br>de souza sorry gives parents hope<br>who are in the midst of the terrible<br>twos<br>new directions also<br>in 2004 i became involved in a new<br>longitudinal study<br>called growing up in new zealand and<br>after a long gestation in 2009<br>we had the antenatal data collection<br>wave<br>where over 6 000 pregnant women<br>and their partners were interviewed on a<br>and some of the early findings that have<br>significant implications<br>for health services are that depression<br>symptoms<br>are actually increased they're more<br>prevalent<br>during pregnancy than during the<br>postnatal month<br>in fact it's quite rare to have women<br>developing depression<br>symptoms postnatally<br>and new fathers also get depression<br>and lisa underwood led all of this<br>research<br>so there was numerous reasons why a new<br>longitudinal study<br>was needed in new zealand<br>and our large sampling region allowed<br>our cohort to be broadly generalizable<br>to contemporary new zealand<br>and our large sample size allows us<br>to look at subgroups gives us the<br>statistical power<br>to look at subgroups and here with liz<br>peterson we are co-domain leaders<br>for the psychosocial and cognitive<br>domain<br>finally earlier this year we were<br>awarded a marston grant<br>to study polygenic and environmental<br>markers of mental health status<br>in new zealand children and our aim is<br>to identify<br>the most significant biological and<br>environmental<br>environmental pathways underpinning<br>child mental health and<br>our hope is that one day our<br>very alarming depression and suicide<br>rates<br>will be reduced thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
