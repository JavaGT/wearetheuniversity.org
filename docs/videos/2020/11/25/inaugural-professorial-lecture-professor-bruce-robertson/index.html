He has contributed to the conservation of some of New Zealand’s most endangered iconic species. From using evolutionary theory to manipulate male-biased sex ratios in kākāpō to mitigating marine mammal bycatch in New Zealand commercial fisheries and defining eradication units in predator control, his research focus addresses a range of pressing wildlife management issues.He is currently leading a Marsden-funded project exploring the genomic architecture of hatching failure in endangered birds (kākāpō and Hawaiian crow), continuing his long-term involvement with the genetic management of kākāpō.<br><br><br>For more than 20 years, he has provided advice and research expertise to species recovery groups (kākāpō, kea, kōkako, black robin, New Zealand sea lion), governmental advisory groups and non-governmental conservation organisations. He has supervised more than 30 postgraduates to completion, including 19 PhD students and has more than 100 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity:

and<br>enterprise<br>here at the university of otago and it's<br>my great pleasure and privilege to<br>welcome you here tonight welcome to<br>colleagues<br>visitors members of the dunedin<br>community to the special occasion for<br>the university<br>and for the department of zoology which<br>is um<br>in particular to celebrate<br>the inaugural professorial lecture of<br>professor bruce robertson<br>special welcome to your family bruce who<br>are here tonight your wife fiona<br>and kids and whanau tana ariana<br>and sylvia who are here tonight<br>and also to those who may be viewing<br>online<br>tonight or at a later stage um<br>an inaugural professorial lecture at the<br>university of otago is a celebration of<br>all that means it means to become a<br>professor here<br>from our founding for scott shan black<br>and sale we have set high standards for<br>all of our professors<br>whether appointed from afar or ground<br>from within<br>um and we require and they demand<br>attributes of sustained excellence in<br>and leadership<br>in at least two of our core activities<br>teaching research and service<br>and a mere sustained excellence in the<br>third<br>in order to be promoted or to be<br>appointed<br>one cannot compromise excellence in one<br>of our areas<br>against weak performance in another and<br>when these standards are met<br>it's well worth celebrating and sharing<br>the occasion which is why we're here<br>tonight<br>and why we will retire for refreshments<br>and fellowship<br>at the staff club at the end of<br>proceedings as well<br>but also for many of our academic<br>community this is also a selfish<br>exercise<br>as it is a an opportunity within our<br>academy to forget about everything else<br>for an hour and hear about the wonderful<br>work and achievements of some of our<br>finest minds it's not<br>purely ceremonial what we have here<br>tonight it is also educational<br>and what we often say is academic spa<br>time for some of us so we really look<br>forward<br>to hearing what you have to say tonight<br>bruce<br>my duty is quite simple i'm here to set<br>the scene<br>on behalf of the vice chancellor who<br>sends her apologies<br>and then hand over to professor richard<br>barker the pro vice chancellor of<br>sciences<br>to introduce our speaker in more detail<br>and then at the end of the proceedings<br>to allow professor jerry kloss the head<br>of department of zoology to give the<br>vote of thanks<br>and lead us to the staff club as i've<br>been<br>we'll make a few very brief remarks<br>though as i have indicated already<br>we do set very high standards for<br>for academic staff members to join our<br>professoriate<br>and in this process we seek the views of<br>many others i've<br>had the privilege to to be able to see<br>some of the things that have been<br>written about your<br>status and contribution bruce through<br>that process both from those<br>explicitly writing as supporters and<br>from those asked<br>to give an impartial evidence-based view<br>and those reviews were<br>uniformly attesting to your national<br>international standing<br>as a research leader your dedication and<br>popularity as a postgraduate supervisor<br>enthusiasm and care for students in your<br>undergraduate<br>teaching and your unstinting service to<br>the people in the fauna that your<br>research<br>sets out to protect so even though i was<br>not connected directly with your<br>promotion bruce<br>your referees confirmed to me uh the<br>wisdom of the vice chancellor endorsing<br>endorsing your promotion and so please<br>accept my heartfelt congratulations and<br>the congratulations of the university<br>for this deserved honor uh and along<br>with the rest of the university i'd like<br>to<br>be the first to formally congratulate<br>congratulations<br>and i now invite professor barker to<br>formally introduce you in the topic of<br>your lecture thank you very much<br>deputy vice chancellors tenacito<br>professor robertson professor kloss<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight professor bruce<br>robertson<br>to give his inaugural professorial<br>lecture at the university of otago<br>as indicated by our deputy vice<br>chancellor<br>bruce is one of our newer professors at<br>the university of otago having<br>received a well-deserved promotion<br>to the position in february of this year<br>bruce was born and raised in brisbane<br>with his birth year of 1969 being<br>particularly noteworthy<br>i used to think it was remarkable that<br>people could be adult and not<br>alive at the time of the moon landing<br>now they can be over 50<br>and not alive then one of the things<br>about australia<br>is that it is a fantastic place for<br>those interested in birds<br>with a diverse array of colorful and<br>behaviorally interesting species<br>these court bruises attention and by the<br>age of 10<br>he knew what he wanted to do in life he<br>wanted to be an ornithologist<br>after attending brisbane grammar and<br>encountering inspirational biology<br>teachers and reminding us once again of<br>how important teachers are in our lives<br>bruce headed off to the university of<br>queensland to study zoology where he<br>graduated with a bsc honours in 1990<br>he followed this with a phd from the<br>same institution in 1997.<br>bruce's research career began in<br>behavioural ecology<br>but his interest was quickly captured by<br>newly developed techniques for using<br>molecular genetics to determine<br>paternity following his phd bruce<br>embarked on a series of post-docs the<br>first being at massey university<br>where he worked on the conservation<br>genetics of the kakapo<br>working with ed minott who i remember<br>well<br>his work with kakapo has been a<br>decade-long<br>decades-long undertaking and he is one<br>of a select group of scientists who can<br>claim to have been bitten by the object<br>bruce's postdoctoral fellowship at<br>massey was followed by another at the<br>max plants<br>planck institute for ornithology in<br>zeeveson germany<br>this was then followed by another at the<br>university of canterbury in new zealand<br>which then evolved into<br>a research fellowship bruce then<br>migrated south<br>taking up a senior lectureship in<br>conservation biology and wildlife<br>management<br>in our own department of zoology in<br>2007.<br>bruce's research here at otago has been<br>impressively productive<br>and it has seen him publish more than<br>100 refereed journal articles<br>averaging more than nine papers per year<br>for the last seven years<br>he has also been successful in<br>attracting research funding with more<br>than two million<br>dollars since he joined us at otago<br>including from the marsden fund of the<br>royal society<br>in 2014 and again in 2018.<br>in addition to his research bruce is a<br>successful teacher<br>a particular note is his postgraduate<br>supervision with<br>19 phd students and 11 masters students<br>having been supervised to completion by<br>bruce<br>thesis topics cover an impressive ray of<br>species kokako<br>black build gulls new zealand sea lions<br>fan tails sinella limpets a brief<br>excursion into the invertebrates<br>brush tailed possums saddlebacks robins<br>kia<br>and of course kakapo to name a few<br>tonight we're going to hear more about<br>these his lecture is entitled<br>wildlife conservation bridging science<br>and practice<br>and in this bruce is going to describe<br>how his work<br>has informed active conservation<br>management in aotearoa<br>and beyond please join me in welcoming<br>professor bruce robertson<br>members of the academic party tenecotto<br>qatar<br>i acknowledge my whanau's whakapapa<br>ngatika hanunu<br>kitiwayora nati pero ngati<br>one thing i'm missing my glasses<br>there we go oh no this<br>okay i also acknowledge that<br>the traditional owners of the land of<br>brisbane the turbo and the jaguar people<br>where i grew up<br>and studied and continue to undertake<br>research<br>it's great to see so many many familiar<br>faces here today<br>colleagues family and future colleagues<br>there are also many people watching<br>online<br>including my family fiona's family in<br>brisbane<br>and our friends around the world<br>unfortunately of course they can't be<br>here due to kobe<br>today i want to share with you my<br>journey that has brought me to the<br>attack<br>to otago and some of the ways that my<br>research group and i<br>have been using scientific research to<br>inform conservation practices<br>in aotearoa new zealand<br>science is a collaborative effort and i<br>would like to thank the many students<br>or my many students and colleagues that<br>i've had and of all have made a<br>significant contribution<br>i was born in brisbane as professor<br>barker said my parents are christine and<br>alan robertson<br>i have an older brother that's brian the<br>one standing next to me<br>with my parents just here it's looking<br>rather grumpy<br>my mum's family the nippers emigrated to<br>brisbane from england<br>in 1954 and my dad's family the<br>robertsons<br>arrived in adelaide from scotland via<br>new zealand<br>surprisingly in 1864 before moving to<br>mundubra<br>and then fangirl in central queensland<br>i'm the husband of fiona robertson fiona<br>and i<br>met when her family moved to brisbane<br>from new zealand in the early 80s<br>fiona has been on this journey with me<br>for the best part of 40 years<br>also assisting with lab and field work<br>and that's very much appreciated<br>fiona has always been a constant source<br>of support and encouragement<br>and it's needed most fiona and i have<br>two<br>awesome kids ariana and tama who have<br>both graduated from the university of<br>otago<br>tama from medicine and ari enjoyed it so<br>much the first time that she's back now<br>again<br>as richard barker said my interest in<br>wildlife started very early on<br>and it started with the documentary<br>series in the wild with harry butler and<br>i remember<br>in particular an episode where he was<br>hunting for the elusive night parrot<br>the species that was thought to be<br>extinct and also many trips where he<br>went<br>pitfall trapping which i used to try and<br>do as well<br>both my parents had phds in geology and<br>my dad was a volcanologist<br>and both were very keen in gemology<br>unfortunately<br>rocks didn't really interest me although<br>i did pick up quite a lot<br>through osmosis while mum and dad were<br>fosking for gold and epidote and kyanite<br>crystals<br>as you can see here i spent my time<br>searching for wildlife<br>on family trips to places like my great<br>uncle's<br>cattle property in central queensland<br>that was called glen roy<br>my interest in wildlife was crystallized<br>in 1977 when i went on the first of two<br>six weeks long gem collecting trips to<br>central australia with my parents<br>and we spent a lot of time in places<br>like this this is in hearts range<br>and this is mount palmer and these old<br>mine sites<br>and while they were looking for<br>gemstones i just got my very first field<br>guide to australian birds and so i was<br>playing harry butler<br>by 10 years of age i knew exactly what i<br>wanted to do<br>as professor barker said i wanted to be<br>an ornithologist<br>and not only that i knew if i wanted to<br>be employed as an ornithologist i needed<br>a phd<br>so off i went to the university of<br>queensland and i started originally<br>doing a zoology degree<br>in the then department of zoology and<br>for my honours<br>i showed using playback experiments that<br>silver eyes can recognize the calls of<br>their mates<br>and so this is some of the work that i<br>did so we were i was<br>producing sonograms and showing that<br>they were statistically individual<br>so at least i could tell them apart but<br>then when i played them back to each<br>other<br>played a mate call a familiar call or a<br>stranger call<br>they predominantly responded to their<br>mates which made a lot of sense<br>i achieved my goal of a phd where i was<br>investigating mating systems in the<br>capricorn silverai<br>which inhabit the coral caves of the<br>great barrier reef<br>i was my supervisor gero cacao's last<br>phd<br>student and he'd been studying the heron<br>island silverado population<br>since the late 60s i spent most<br>of almost an entire year on the island<br>collecting dna samples and behave in<br>undertaking behavioral observations erin<br>island is home to over a hundred<br>thousand noddies which is a sea bird<br>that nests in trees<br>and around about the same number of<br>mutton birds which nest in the ground<br>this makes for working on silver eyes a<br>channel a challenge<br>where you're continually trying to avoid<br>a rain of guano from above<br>and try not to fall down mutton bird<br>holes from below<br>so some of the stuff that i was doing<br>was mapping breeding territories<br>and then i was also monitoring the nests<br>so finding them<br>and finding counting the eggs<br>determining when the chicks are at a<br>certain age and then banding them<br>and then when they were old enough i was<br>taking blood samples from the adults but<br>also the cheeks<br>i was also undertaking a range of other<br>recordings like copulation frequency<br>and dawn chorus activity all things to<br>do with paternity guards because at the<br>time it was thought<br>that sperm competition was really common<br>in birds<br>but we'd never seen it in silver eyes<br>and so as it turned out after i'd done<br>dna fingerprinting<br>on these guys we found that they were<br>actually genetically monogamous which<br>was bucking the trend at the time<br>silverize typically lay three eggs and<br>if we ever found a nest like this it was<br>payday<br>because gero used to give us a forex<br>beer<br>so i started my phd as a complete<br>genetic novice<br>and i learned dna fingerprinting to<br>examine paternity and found that silver<br>eyes were as i said genetically<br>monogamous<br>and so they were genetically monogamous<br>no sperm competition but unusually they<br>had no paternity guards<br>so they were quite unusual for all the<br>birds at the time<br>so incidentally there's a um a link to<br>the zoology department here with my<br>supervisor professor jira kakawa<br>so jiro was a teaching fellow at the<br>university of otago from 1958 to 1961<br>and he was actually in zoology where he<br>was studying silverize and he'd been<br>employed by the past head of zoology<br>brian marples<br>after which the maples building is named<br>giro passed away a few years ago<br>but he was an amazing mentor and so over<br>the years he always had well-timed words<br>of encouragement<br>things like when i was trying to find a<br>job a permanent one<br>that sort of rarest things like hen's<br>teeth<br>he just used to say keep publishing they<br>when i finished my phd i thought i'd be<br>the last time that i'd work on heron<br>island<br>little did i know 20 years later in 2014<br>i was awarded a marsden to investigate<br>the paradox of the great speciator<br>with colleagues dr sonya clegg and<br>professor ian owens<br>silverados are great speciators these<br>are species that have really good<br>dispersal ability<br>but they have this strong propensity to<br>speciate hence this is the paradox how<br>can that occur<br>worldwide there are over a hundred<br>the novel idea came from the observation<br>that european migratory populations were<br>suddenly becoming<br>sedentary and this was due to climate<br>change genetic variation at these<br>migration genes<br>suggested that a possible switch between<br>migratory and non-migratory behavior<br>might exist and so this switch<br>could be the resolution to the paradox<br>of the great speciators<br>so we had all the pieces of the puzzle<br>so sonya clegg had done an amazing<br>amount of sampling over the years<br>and so we had all these samples from all<br>these locations we had different times<br>since colonization there's new zealand<br>where they colonized in around about<br>1830<br>and then there's heron island up here<br>where they'd been<br>on the island for about 3000 years and<br>then other places like lord howe<br>where they'd been there for a hundred<br>thousand years so we had all these<br>different<br>colonization events and rates and we<br>also had these candidate genes so all<br>the pieces of the puzzle<br>i won't talk more about this in this<br>talk<br>so my first postdoc was on kakapo<br>at massey university in palmerston north<br>and as was mentioned it was with ed<br>minod and i was working in dave<br>lambert's molecular lab<br>and this started a 23 year long<br>association with kakapo recovery<br>i applied the new genetic techniques i'd<br>learnt during my phd<br>to paternity and also determining sex of<br>kakapo<br>and as i said and said was mentioned i<br>started evolving from a behavioral<br>ecologist to turning into a conservation<br>geneticist<br>my second postdoc was at max planck in<br>sevison<br>just outside of munich in bavaria and<br>here i was employed to set up a<br>molecular ecology lab<br>in a new research group i also<br>researched sex allocation in canadian<br>tree swallows<br>and sex allocation is basically where<br>females in good condition<br>tend to produce more suns so i did lots<br>and lots of dna sexing<br>as well as learning new techniques of<br>automated genotyping<br>we lived next to the world famous<br>cluster closter andex<br>so there was a little bit of beer<br>appreciation as well<br>and because we lived in the middle of<br>europe we got to experience a range of<br>cultures and that was<br>amazing for the kids growing up and<br>incidentally both of them<br>developed bavarian accents and they<br>my third post doc was with um well it<br>was with neil gammel and i was actually<br>his first postdoc<br>and in that i spent two seven week trips<br>down on end to be island<br>in new zealand sub-antarctic where i was<br>examining male<br>sea lion breeding behaviour it was<br>actually a postdoc where i needed to be<br>able to run<br>very fast in gumboots on sand<br>and it involved crossbow biopsying so<br>here i am<br>using a crossbow to take a sample from a<br>male and bleach marking males<br>for re-sighting and behavioral<br>observations it's actually<br>quite nerve-racking where you'd sneak up<br>on behind a sea lion and<br>squirt this stuff on it would then<br>bleach their fur but that's funny<br>because they have a blind spot so if you<br>crouch down low enough<br>when they look up they can't see you and<br>so you play this game<br>and if they catch you out they're<br>amazingly quick at spinning around<br>so an outcome of this we we bleach<br>marked around 200 individuals and then<br>they left<br>after the breeding season these adult<br>males we found that they went to a<br>number of interesting places<br>and from this we actually concluded that<br>males could be a vector of disease<br>so when they come down to the breeding<br>seas are breeding beaches and then go<br>back<br>another thing i learned is that if you<br>sneak up on a sea lion and you scare it<br>and doesn't know you're there<br>you need to keep your mouth closed i did<br>this once<br>and they spin around so fast and<br>unfortunately it's think to let go<br>and so i got sprayed with poo so you<br>need to<br>word to the wise keep your mouth shut<br>as well as sea lions i got back into<br>kokobo research and i was doing<br>paternity analysis for the bumper 2002<br>breeding season<br>i also worked on other species like fur<br>seals where i was looking at bycatch<br>and assigning provenance of that bycatch<br>to examine the impact of fishing<br>on new zealand sea lion colonies i also<br>did some work on blue duck genetics<br>where we were<br>asked to basically see if the north<br>island and the south island were so<br>genetically distinct<br>they shouldn't translocate individuals<br>between the two populations<br>and as it turns out they are and so that<br>has actually<br>impacted the translocation planning for<br>i also was employed as a fixed term<br>lecturer in this time frame at<br>university of canterbury so i was<br>teaching conservation genetics<br>and here i was able to gain valuable<br>undergraduate teaching experience<br>as i was teaching in teaching genetics<br>in first second<br>i arrived at otago in 2008 and i was<br>employed to teach into the wildlife<br>management program<br>so basically i was asked to bring my<br>skills and all the linkages i<br>developed so that i can contribute to<br>the wildlife program<br>i continued to develop research projects<br>on various new zealand native species<br>including new zealand sea lions<br>and this is out on the peninsula we were<br>weighing the sea lion pup<br>and i also started a banding project on<br>rockren in the home a tunnel area with a<br>past student of ian jemisons at this<br>point i'd like to thank the late<br>emeritus professor ian jamison<br>he was an absolutely brilliant mentor<br>and colleague<br>ian was actually the person who rang me<br>up and offered me the job<br>which was really good timing as we were<br>in the process of packing up our lives<br>in christchurch and we're probably going<br>to move back to australia<br>any and i'm sure as everyone would agree<br>a more recent research project that<br>we've developed is on inbreeding in<br>karwang on lordhow island in the tasman<br>sea<br>so it's just off sydney this is a<br>collaboration with dr melanie mazzaro<br>from charles sturt university in aubrey<br>rodonga<br>in australia just down on the murray<br>where i'm also<br>an adjunct fellow sakarawan on the<br>island are thought to be quite<br>inbred as they display poor hatching<br>success<br>they also um have most likely been<br>impacted by the mo the recent rat<br>eradication<br>because carl wongs are scavengers and<br>rats die and they actually can be killed<br>so they took a lot into captivity and so<br>what we're doing is we're using genetics<br>to look at the impact of that red<br>eradication<br>because we've got samples before and<br>we've got samples after<br>we're also trying to determine what<br>level of inbreeding they do have<br>and we're doing that by comparing the<br>lord howe population with<br>carol wong on the mainland of australia<br>and so this information will allow<br>managers basically to to manage the<br>karaoke population moving forward<br>so i have the pleasure of teaching into<br>zoology's wildlife management degree<br>along with yolanda and his heag and phil<br>seden i run the paper<br>wilm401 and its principles in wildlife<br>management<br>and this paper aims to teach the<br>principles by examining current<br>practices<br>in wildlife management using discussions<br>with active managers<br>a highlight of this paper is the<br>three-day field trip to fjordland which<br>are run in collaboration with dr joe<br>monks of doc<br>so joe is an honorary fellow in zoology<br>and makes an extremely<br>important contribution there the<br>students do a range of activities<br>including<br>rock green monitoring when we actually<br>get to see rockrent<br>carca tracking bat catching again when<br>we catch bats but<br>the anticipation is really important<br>catching one<br>and skink surveys it also gives the<br>students the experience of the four<br>seasons in one day<br>of working in fjordland and the gear<br>list for this trip<br>is always a real challenge we've had<br>everything from snow to<br>burning sun a strong science basis<br>is essential to tackle complex problems<br>we face especially in wildlife<br>conservation<br>and i believe that universities are well<br>placed to make a significant<br>contribution in this regard<br>it does involve aligning the competing<br>interests and requirements of the<br>practitioners<br>and also the academics in academia we<br>tend to lean towards blue sky<br>science that sort of science for science<br>sake while practitioners need and want<br>focus management outcomes so bringing<br>science or bridging science and practice<br>involves identifying that<br>bit in the middle just here so it's the<br>important research questions that tick<br>both boxes<br>so we need to have that academic<br>achievement to keep the<br>encounters happy the all-important<br>publications the sort of lifeblood of<br>academia and the practical outcomes are<br>really important for managers<br>and so on rare occasions we do get<br>this sort of marriage together and you<br>can actually get things like marsden<br>funding which i'll show you a little bit<br>later on<br>so there is a real clear need and desire<br>for science and wildlife conservation<br>there's almost 4 000 taxa in new zealand<br>that are a conservation concern however<br>there's only about<br>430 which is around sort of 10 percent<br>that are managed for<br>persistence on top of that there's<br>another 5 000 taxa<br>that are data deficient so we just don't<br>know enough about them<br>and so there isn't sufficient<br>information to have some sort of<br>meaningful conservation<br>action so there's clearly a lot to do<br>and university research can really value<br>add in this landscape<br>so it's great that managers so there's<br>not only a need but there's also great<br>that managers are also keen for this<br>knowledge so there's the desire<br>and this is shown by a survey on<br>genetics in conservation done by the<br>otago researchers<br>including zoology's yolanda van he see<br>and so essentially here in the survey<br>they asked managers<br>in department conservation a number of<br>questions about cons<br>about genetics in conservation and it<br>highlights that there's both<br>the importance of genetics it also<br>highlights that managers understand the<br>impact of genetics<br>and they also understand the desire so<br>there's a desire to actually get this<br>knowledge<br>so it bodes well for us sort of marrying<br>the two the science and the practice<br>and encouragingly the call for<br>engagement also comes from the top<br>down<br>so i've been fortunate to have a very<br>talented group of postgraduate students<br>over the years<br>my students have i and i have engaged<br>with a range of governmental<br>and non-governmental organizations to<br>affect positive<br>conservation outcomes our research has<br>informed the management of some iconic<br>new zealand<br>threatened species and some of which are<br>shown here<br>we've also made tangible differences to<br>not only species conservation practice<br>but also the scientific literature which<br>is the all-important both sides of the<br>coin<br>my students and this is a question i get<br>asked quite a lot by parents who you<br>know<br>their children or kids are coming to<br>otago in the future<br>how do they get employed where do the<br>students go off to so my students have<br>all gone on to employment and they've<br>variously been employed as academics<br>conservation managers in various<br>conservation projects around the world<br>government scientists non-governmental<br>organizations employ them and they've<br>also<br>been private contractors so there's lots<br>and lots of jobs<br>everyone should be doing zoology<br>everyone should be doing wildlife<br>conservation<br>so in the rest of my talk i will share<br>with you some of the examples of our<br>research<br>and show how we've bridged or hopefully<br>show you how we've bridged<br>so in this first example is looking at<br>resolving taxonomic<br>uncertainty so this is there's almost 5<br>000 new zealand<br>taxa which are data deficient so we just<br>don't have enough information about them<br>and one of the important things that we<br>don't know about many things is where<br>they're taxonomically placed<br>so taxonomically indeterminate species<br>don't get<br>conservation priority or funding which<br>is a major problem<br>and so we really do need to resolve the<br>taxonomic uncertainty it's essential<br>so taxonomic uncertainty was one thing<br>that<br>revolved around the new zealand store<br>petrol and this is<br>this example of a a small storm petrol<br>species that was<br>dramatically recited in the hierarchy<br>golf this little guy here<br>in 2003 and it was first seen by brent<br>stevenson<br>and sav seville and it looked very very<br>similar to<br>a species the new zealand storm petrol<br>which is this one here<br>and it was only known from three museum<br>skins collected over 150 years ago<br>but unfortunately it was extinct or<br>presumed extinct<br>so the question is if it's the same what<br>is the new zealand storm petrol<br>there'd been a lot of taxonomic<br>uncertainty about it<br>and it's variously been called the<br>plumage abnormality of just another<br>species and there's this so-called polio<br>phenomenon this sort of<br>and so it wasn't until we actually got a<br>dna sample it took quite a lot of effort<br>from people like brent stevenson and<br>others to get a dna sample but once we<br>had it we could use genetics and we can<br>identify that<br>the museum specimens and the bird out in<br>heraki gulf were one in the same<br>so clearly the new zealand storm petrol<br>was no longer extinct because it still<br>existed<br>but the question was what is it so it<br>had been previously thought to be<br>an oceanity storm petrol so something<br>like a wilson storm petrol<br>but i thought well not unfortunately but<br>interestingly when we<br>ran the phylogenetic analysis it grouped<br>in with the forgetta storm petrols<br>and that's using both mitochondrial dna<br>and also nuclear dna here<br>so we concluded that it's a distinct<br>species and this is forgetta mariana<br>and so it went from being this unknown<br>thing to suddenly<br>birdlife international recognized the<br>species and they became a critically<br>endangered species overnight<br>and so consequently they could get<br>research funding and so on so this just<br>really highlights how important it is<br>for taxonomic designations<br>and conservation subsequently the<br>the breeding population was found<br>because we didn't know where they bred<br>and chris gaskin and matt rainer and<br>colleagues discovered it and how turo<br>little barrier<br>so funding is also limited as we all<br>know but it means that conservation<br>managers can't save everything that<br>they'd like to<br>and so what we need to do is put our<br>effort where we get the best possible<br>outcome<br>and unfortunately that requires hard<br>decisions<br>and so the thinking is that certain<br>populations in a species<br>are probably going to be higher priority<br>things like<br>populations in more productive habitat<br>or ones that are genetically more<br>distinct<br>and here population genetic structure<br>can actually guide our choices<br>so genetic structure is influenced by<br>past population environment<br>and in this regard genetics gives us a<br>historical perspective<br>so if we look at the last glacial maxima<br>about 22 000 years ago<br>the south island looked quite different<br>from what it<br>from how it does today the forests had<br>contracted<br>into the kaharangi region up here<br>there's the southern alps there were far<br>more glaciers and permanent snow<br>and out to the east the glacier the<br>braided rivers extended out much further<br>due to lower sea levels<br>so the habitat and patterns that we<br>might expect to see<br>would be quite different amongst the<br>species and this is what we found when<br>we looked at both alpine<br>so for alpine species we examined and<br>this is<br>kia and rockren we found a clear<br>north-south differentiation along the<br>south island which is what we'd expect<br>with<br>the past last glacial maximum<br>distributions of things<br>in endangered kia which care currently<br>number around about 5 000 birds<br>nick dussek's phd research found that<br>there were three clusters from north to<br>south and these are the three colors<br>blue green and red<br>similarly kerry weston's research on<br>rockran again<br>rockren are endangered there's probably<br>a similar number of them<br>and we found quite distinct differences<br>between the north and also the south<br>and this split just here was centered on<br>in both instances these findings have<br>informed ongoing species management<br>for rock brand the two clusters are<br>recognized and managed separately<br>and for future planning of any captive<br>care insurance populations<br>we will need to draw from the three kia<br>clusters<br>to sample the existing genetic diversity<br>and to save that<br>so when we looked at the braided river<br>species remember the habitat increased<br>at the last glacial maximum it didn't<br>decrease<br>given this we might expect to see little<br>population structure<br>and that's actually what we found so<br>this is work from claudia micheller's<br>master's thesis where she was looking at<br>black belt gull which is the most<br>endangered gull species in the world<br>and she found that there was no<br>population structure in the south island<br>but there was when you looked between<br>the north and the south island which was<br>quite interesting<br>similarly ann slesselman's study on<br>black fronted turn<br>and this is just looking across the<br>south island found very little genetic<br>differentiation there is a suggestion of<br>sort of two groupings but it's not as<br>clear as in kier<br>or in rock ring so both of these studies<br>have actually provided valuable<br>information for ongoing species<br>management<br>so not only do we look at population<br>structure to decide what<br>to conserve or save we can also flip it<br>on its head and look at how we can<br>actually<br>define things that we can eradicate<br>successfully<br>so a genetic understanding of population<br>structure can actually aid pest control<br>because it targets which populations<br>we're going to eradicate<br>this example here is some work that we<br>did on brown rats<br>brown rats were introduced to south<br>georgia island and the south atlantic<br>over 200 years ago<br>they impact on the island endemics and<br>things like the<br>pipette just here the south georgian<br>pintail<br>and also various seabirds and they<br>caused quite a lot of problems<br>so managers were very keen to eradicate<br>rats<br>however this would have been one of the<br>largest island radications ever<br>attempted<br>and consequently due to size alone or<br>the scale there was a very high<br>probability of failure if they tried it<br>as<br>one go fortunately the island's<br>extensive glaciation provided<br>so rats on south georgia are separated<br>into small<br>isolated pockets by this glaciation<br>and you can see here some of these<br>glaciers are very formidable this one<br>here is five kilometers wide<br>so we were asked to test if glaciation<br>was in fact<br>a barrier to rat dispersal so if<br>populations were isolated then rats<br>could be sequentially<br>eradicated over time and there would be<br>limited<br>possibility of re-invasion so what we<br>did is we looked at this peninsula here<br>green peninsula<br>we sampled rats just there and in this<br>location<br>we used genetic markers and then we<br>tried to assign the rats to each of the<br>locations<br>and with almost 100 accuracy we could<br>identify where they'd come from<br>so this suggested that they were very<br>very different<br>and that there was no gene flow across<br>this barrier so across<br>with either the fjord or across these<br>glaciers<br>so it was clear that the glaciers were<br>actually barriers to rat dispersal<br>and interestingly interestingly this was<br>the first example<br>of us using rat eradication units<br>and so this term was picked up in the<br>literature and it's used now quite<br>commonly<br>so armed with this knowledge the british<br>government proceeded with the rate<br>eradication and they did it over three<br>three years and so here you can see<br>these different colors of the three<br>years that they eradicated them<br>and time really was of the essence<br>because you know with climate change<br>glaciers are<br>receding and as you can see here this is<br>the haka<br>glacier and in the 10-year difference<br>it's receded quite a bit<br>and so if this continued on eventually<br>they wouldn't be able to do sequential<br>eradication because rats just would have<br>spread everywhere<br>so by all accounts the eradication has<br>been successful<br>and this is an excellent example of<br>science having a practical outcome that<br>makes a real world difference<br>the south georgia and flora and fauna<br>are now flourishing without rats closer<br>to home<br>we've also identified eradication units<br>in<br>new zealand where we've looked at it in<br>cats and also in possums<br>so this is some of amy adams's phd<br>research which showed that otago<br>peninsula<br>the population of possums on otago<br>peninsula is actually an eradication<br>unit<br>so there's no dispersal across either at<br>portobello<br>or across here at arrow moana and so<br>when you look at the genetic<br>differentiation<br>possums are only coming in and out of<br>the peninsula through dunedin<br>so if you put a cork in the bottle you<br>can then eradicate the rats<br>at the possums off the otago peninsula<br>you could also do rats<br>okay so another way that our research<br>has contributed is um<br>informing species recoveries to recovery<br>targets<br>this is really important because it it<br>actually tells you when you've been<br>successful so you have to know<br>a point at which you've recovered a<br>species so sometimes this<br>information just isn't available so like<br>in the case of the endemic new zealand<br>sea lion<br>the world's rarest atari new zealand sea<br>lions<br>accidentally killed as bycatch in the<br>auckland island squid fishery<br>government and various stakeholders has<br>worked for decades to try and reverse<br>the<br>near 40 decline of the auckland island<br>population<br>so here we we record the population size<br>as pup number and it's been a 40<br>decline and modelling<br>management settings which is the number<br>of sea lions that are allowed to be<br>accidentally killed each year in the<br>squid fishery<br>they aim to keep the population at 90<br>percent of carrying capacity and this is<br>what<br>managers would deem to be success if<br>they did then<br>the modeling they used set a carrying<br>capacity of the sea lions for only<br>around about 7 000 individuals<br>however it's unknown how many sea lions<br>there were in the past and this is<br>because<br>just like all other seals they were<br>decimated during 18th century ceiling<br>and indeed if there were many more sea<br>lions than the 7<br>000 that they are estimating then<br>management would not be achieving its<br>so one thing i did is that using the<br>very good relationship between genetic<br>diversity and population size<br>in that larger populations have more<br>genetic diversity<br>i estimated how many sea lions there<br>were in the past<br>so historical population size was<br>estimated<br>using actual genetic diversity values<br>and this study indicates that there were<br>at least 10 times more sea lions in the<br>past than the model estimated<br>the current 7 000 individuals so clearly<br>the management target set by the<br>government was too low<br>therefore fisheries management was<br>essentially placing a cap<br>on sea lion recovery and indeed the sea<br>lion population if you look at it this<br>is the one that's most heavily impacted<br>by the squid fishery in the auckland<br>islands<br>continues to decline slowly<br>and at this point it's it's important to<br>note that for most managers<br>that you work with they're really keen<br>to incorporate the findings<br>whatever findings you've produced into<br>their management<br>unfortunately it's my experience that<br>this is not the case when there are<br>competing economic interests<br>and how you get around that it's a talk<br>so a strong focus of my research group<br>is aiding threatened species management<br>this is how my wildlife conservation<br>journey began when i did my first<br>postdoc in incorporating genetics<br>into kakapo management back in 1996.<br>so at the time there had just been a<br>major review of carcapo recovery<br>and there was also a brand new recovery<br>plan<br>where genetics featured as an objective<br>for the very first time<br>despite this objective i still needed to<br>justify why genetics was important<br>especially at a time when kakapo<br>numbered just 51 individuals<br>so it was quite dire and it wasn't until<br>the bumper breeding season of 2002 which<br>you can see<br>just here that the situation changed<br>and management was no longer in some<br>one of the early achievements of<br>genetics in kakapo management<br>was detecting and resolving sex<br>allocation<br>so sex allocation is where mothers in<br>better condition produce<br>more of the sex with a higher fitness<br>return in birds that's typically the<br>suns<br>so this issue was not appreciated in<br>kakapo but it was well known in various<br>bird species<br>indeed i actually researched this in<br>tree swallows in germany in the late<br>1990s<br>so kakapo recovery had employed<br>supplementary feeding since around 1989<br>and it had been a really quite a major<br>benefit so it improved chick survival<br>and it also improved female body<br>condition but unfortunately it hadn't<br>increased breeding<br>frequency as hoped so kakapo was still<br>only breeding every two to five years<br>but using dna sexing of eggs embryos and<br>chicks we found that supplementary fed<br>females produce more suns<br>which was not ideal given that kakapo<br>were already heavily male sex biased<br>and indeed it's moved through some<br>modelling that we did we found that<br>if this was left unchecked sex<br>allocation could hinder kakapo recovery<br>by decades<br>so because supplementary feeding was<br>really important and had these important<br>benefits<br>we needed to come up with some sort of<br>creative solution<br>so what we did is we targeted the<br>feeding to bring all females up to a<br>breeding condition<br>so females generally didn't breed if<br>they were less than 1.5<br>kilograms of weight so only<br>predicted un underweight females<br>received as much food as they could<br>eat at leviton food and indeed this did<br>actually pull their weights up<br>above that breeding threshold and when<br>we looked at dna<br>or used dna sexing to look at the eggs<br>and checks of those females<br>we showed that we'd actually removed any<br>bias so we now had an equal sex ratio<br>so hence we'd controlled sex allocation<br>and indeed this is the first use of<br>evolutionary theory in conservation<br>genetics and at the time<br>it was a really big deal and importantly<br>as well<br>our approach highlights promise as a<br>method to manipulate sex ratios in other<br>threatened species<br>such as zoo animals where sex allocation<br>i'm pleased to say that genetic<br>management is now a routine<br>process in kakapo recovery and a key to<br>genetic management is understanding the<br>relationships<br>so in kakapo relationships can be<br>unknown due to the species elect mating<br>system<br>and females also mate with multiple<br>males on the leg which results in sperm<br>competition so you don't know which<br>father<br>which individual male fathered the<br>chicks<br>plus doc uses artificial insemination to<br>produce desired paternities<br>but this is done after a female has<br>already made it so again you have this<br>sort of sperm competition scenario<br>and over the years we've used various<br>methods to determine the relatedness<br>starting with dna fingerprinting and<br>then microsatellites and more recently<br>gbs<br>or is happening by sequencing so we've<br>resolved the paternities and we've<br>pieced together<br>kakapo's focal power and with this<br>information we can avoid mating between<br>close relatives and hence avoid<br>inbreeding or at least minimizing<br>breeding<br>another uncertainty with the<br>relationships is that many of the<br>founders were found as adults<br>when they were discovered in the late<br>80s or in the 80s on stewart island<br>so consequently as they're adults<br>there's no information of who's related<br>to whom so you haven't found chicks with<br>their mothers<br>and so on and we know that amongst the<br>founders that we're<br>many of them are related so this here<br>we've got a relatedness on the side<br>and these are different relatedness<br>categories so here we've got<br>parent offspring and full siblings these<br>are the founders<br>and so in this red circle<br>we basically have all of these dots so<br>these individuals are actually as<br>related as<br>parent and offspring so we know that<br>there are relationships amongst<br>the founders and so this is some of the<br>work that laura bergner did for her<br>master's thesis with myself and ian<br>jemison<br>and she looked into resolving the<br>relationship amongst the founders<br>and lara found a number of unknown<br>relationships for example<br>flossie and merv are quite likely full<br>siblings<br>so this information again feeds into<br>kakapo management and so you can<br>decide who's going to make with whom and<br>you don't get close relatives mating<br>it's really really important to know<br>this information when you're doing<br>artificial insemination<br>because you're actually choosing which<br>individuals are going to potentially<br>breed<br>artificial insemination in kakapo first<br>was used in 2009<br>and this picture here is of juan blanco<br>where he's artificially inseminating the<br>kakapo ruth<br>ruth is upside down here help being held<br>by daryl eason<br>and this is the first kakapo to be<br>artificially inseminated<br>so using the relatedness of individuals<br>allows unrelated individuals to be<br>chosen as sperm donors<br>so you're basically avoiding her<br>relatives and this is what we did so we<br>had<br>these are all the males that potentially<br>could be sperm donors<br>and this is ruth and so we did a genetic<br>comparison this is how related they are<br>at this end jimmy is really unrelated<br>and<br>that says lee lee is most likely a<br>parent<br>offspring or a full sibling so you<br>wouldn't want to mate with lee<br>ideally you'd want to mate with jimmy<br>and here comes the sort of logistic<br>constraints<br>you want to use jimmy but unfortunately<br>jimmy's not producing any sperm<br>and so the ones that were were murty and<br>nerve<br>so they were mixed and that sperm was<br>artificially inseminated into ruth<br>but this process allows you to avoid<br>inbreeding<br>setting up bad matings so mating between<br>relatives<br>results in inbreeding and that can<br>actually reduce reproductive success and<br>this is so called in breeding depression<br>in birds inbreeding depression appears<br>as poor hatching success<br>in kakapo approximately 50 percent in<br>some years it's worse 50 of eggs don't<br>hatch<br>in non-inbred birds that's somewhere in<br>the range of around about 10<br>of eggs don't hatch so you can see it's<br>quite elevated<br>so katelyn white's masters research<br>looked into this<br>and she showed that females that are<br>more inbred actually have more unhatched<br>eggs<br>and this indicates that there is a<br>genetic basis to<br>poor hatching success in kakapo<br>it also highlights importantly i think<br>that<br>you need to have ongoing management of<br>kakapo to minimize future inbreeding<br>because you can't make an inbred female<br>any<br>less inbred the only way you can resolve<br>this problem is by stopping<br>chicks in the future from being in breed<br>matings<br>another question that's still really<br>relevant is<br>what do we do with the last fiordland<br>kakapo richard henry's genes<br>and how do we incorporate them and at<br>what level into the cockpit gene pool<br>and this is some work that i um i<br>started with ian jamison and fred<br>allendorf<br>a few years back so we know that richard<br>henry has novel genetic variation<br>as shown by his immunity genes and this<br>is work<br>done by gabby nafla for her phd and so<br>here we have the immunity genes<br>richard henry mated with flossie had<br>three chicks sinbad cooler and gulliver<br>and you can see the<br>genetic variants that were passed on at<br>this immunity gene<br>so there is new and different genetic<br>variation<br>this variation is beneficial to kakapo<br>recovery as it affects a genetic or<br>potentially can affected genetic rescue<br>where you're helping<br>kakapo into the future and we found that<br>it takes around 10 to 12<br>offspring to pass 99 of richard henry's<br>rare genetic variants on<br>unfortunately richard henry only had<br>three offspring before he died<br>and this is rich and henry here with don<br>merton so the focus is now<br>on getting the three birds his offspring<br>to breed<br>however with new gene new methods here a<br>genomic study led by nick dussex liver<br>darling and myself<br>we now know that richard henry not only<br>has good genetic variants<br>but he also has some potentially<br>deleterious variants<br>that had been lost from the stuart<br>island population during its 100<br>000 year isolation<br>so we don't know what these deleterious<br>mutations might do in the future<br>but at the very least we need to factor<br>this new research finding into<br>how we're going to incorporate richard<br>henry's genes<br>into the population moving forward<br>the last method to be added to genetic<br>management<br>of kakapo is genomics in 2012 i helped<br>instigate the effort to whole genome<br>sequence the kakapo<br>my goal was to advance kakbo genetic<br>management by providing more molecular<br>tools for researchers<br>in this project we developed a platinum<br>quality genome that is<br>at the time set the standard for genome<br>sequencing<br>and just as an interesting side story<br>here we've got jane jane wasn't the<br>first kakapo that was earmarked to be<br>genome sequenced it was actually alice<br>but at the last minute they had to have<br>a change because of a sampling issue<br>and i had to choose another bird so i<br>chose jane from the blood samples that i<br>had to hand<br>and i thought it was fitting that as it<br>let jane make a significant contribution<br>to kakapo recovery<br>as jane was old and arthritic and was<br>the only surviving founder kakapo never<br>to have bred<br>so she had no chance of contributing to<br>so building on jane's genome we were in<br>a position to genome sequence other<br>kakapo<br>at lower cost i was the conservation<br>geneticist on this project to genome<br>sequence all living kakapo was quite an<br>ambitious project<br>i was responsible for funding the dna<br>preparation and developing future<br>research using the genomic data<br>and we genome sequenced a total of 168<br>cockpit<br>the first data was obtained in june 2016<br>however doc decided to wait for all data<br>to be generated before using it<br>then in a surprising move doc handed the<br>research<br>genome data and publication rights from<br>as i mentioned earlier it's possible for<br>science and practice to be married into<br>blue skies science<br>as we've seen kakapo have very poor<br>hatching success<br>which is a common issue with endangered<br>birds worldwide<br>in 2018 my colleagues and i from the<br>university of hawaii<br>university of sydney and the san diego<br>zoo were awarded a marsden to<br>investigate hatching failure<br>using whole genome sequencing dr<br>stephanie grosser joined us<br>as the post-doc on this project we plan<br>to use case control<br>a case control approach to compare<br>genomic architecture of living<br>and early death embryos in kakapo and<br>the hawaiian crow<br>the alala we had access to a large<br>sample of early death embryos for both<br>species<br>i'd been collecting kakapo material for<br>the last 20 years<br>we would then develop breeding<br>strategies to improve hatching success<br>in both species<br>unfortunately due to issues with dock<br>kakapo had to be dropped from<br>our marsden made really good progress<br>on alala stephanie has whole genome<br>sequenced 170<br>embryos and live birds and we have a<br>high quality chromosomal level assembly<br>for the alala<br>and so we plan to have breeding<br>strategies in place to improve alala<br>hatching success<br>um in the next breeding season and so<br>the alala system<br>is really quite cool because it's all<br>avery based<br>and they monitor the nest so here you<br>can see in this picture<br>all these different nests constantly<br>being monitored and so they do<br>quite hands-on engagement so it'll be a<br>really good<br>way of implementing these breeding<br>strategies<br>okay so looking to the future genomics<br>is a key methodology in the field of<br>conservation genetics and it's here to<br>stay<br>and in actual fact conservation genetics<br>is evolving into the field of<br>conservation genomics<br>and so while costs are coming down whole<br>genome sequencing like that done for the<br>kakapo 125 project<br>is still beyond the reach of recovery<br>efforts that don't have rich benefactors<br>for example i contributed 40 000 to that<br>project for just dna preparation alone<br>fortunately there are cheaper genomic<br>methods<br>things like genotyping by sequencing or<br>gbs<br>in a collaboration with ag research we<br>developed gbs methodologies for kakapo<br>and the paternity and relatedness from<br>this gbs data<br>that we determined was used for<br>management of the most recent breeding<br>season<br>and currently yasmine foster a phd<br>student<br>is working on comparing gbs to whole<br>genome sequencing<br>for genetic management of calculate and<br>what we're finding<br>is that it shows that gbs these sort of<br>cheaper methods are providing<br>reliable information at a fraction of<br>the cost<br>and so there's a cost-effective approach<br>like this will allow conservation<br>managers<br>access to the much needed genetic<br>i'd like again to thank the

just<br>what can be achieved with excellent<br>research and conservation<br>advocacy and for that we thank you<br>professor robertson's presentation<br>reminds us of the essential need<br>for high quality independent and<br>university-based research<br>to manage the ever-increasing pressure<br>of human activities on the natural world<br>bruce's work has time and time again<br>provided the essential information<br>needed to mitigate<br>and define the limits of our activities<br>bruce's extensive work on various<br>antarctic islands also reminds us<br>that even in the most remote locations<br>we they now require careful and<br>considered management<br>such as the extent of our collective<br>human reach<br>professors robertson's work also<br>demonstrates the importance of<br>taxonomic research and that's a<br>discipline that's often neglected in the<br>biological sciences<br>bruce's work has rediscovered extinct<br>species<br>and without such work would be<br>impossible to implement the essential<br>conservation<br>measures that will hopefully prevent<br>species such as the new zealand storm<br>petrol<br>from really going extinct once and for<br>all<br>similar's work on the population genetic<br>structure of various<br>other threatened species as he talked<br>about this evening allows for efficient<br>targeting of<br>limited conservation resources to the<br>populations most in need of conservation<br>and protection<br>professor robertson's work also<br>highlights the extraordinary diverse<br>range of skills required a conservation<br>biologist<br>from the practical challenges of field<br>work in very different environments to<br>the mastery of a wide range of<br>complex methodological and statistical<br>approaches<br>further being committed to ensuring<br>research findings are integrated into<br>effective management<br>bruce has also successfully translated<br>what might initially seem to be esoteric<br>research into very efficient<br>effective conservation and management<br>approaches<br>whilst this step might seem might also<br>seem to be the most frustrating as bruce<br>alluded to in his talk there<br>it can also be the most rewarding as we<br>can appreciate from this presentation<br>bruce can be immensely proud of the very<br>significant<br>contributions he has made to the<br>conservation of global fauna<br>in closing i'd like to formally invite<br>you all to thank professor robertson<br>once again for his informative<br>and very inspirational presentation<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
