How then did Ben end up studying medicine at the University of Auckland and what does he have to say about his experience in the Big Smoke?<br> <br>The University of Auckland’s Regional Rural Admission Scheme (RRAS) supports the entrance of more rural people into health care professions.  This is incredibly important to not only ensure our medical and health workforces are representative of our society; but also because rural people are more likely to go on to serve rural communities.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i come from a small town<br>it's called least and it's about an hour<br>south of christchurch just on the east<br>coast<br>decided towards the end of high school<br>that medicine was probably the thing<br>that i was going to pursue<br>and then i was fortunate enough that the<br>university offered me a bunch of money<br>to come to auckland<br>so i jumped on that opportunity i've<br>been up to auckland a few times for<br>different sports tournaments and<br>cultural events<br>town that i come from obviously auckland<br>is a behemoth<br>compared to that and one suburb is<br>really bigger than the town that i grew<br>up in<br>for medical students both the university<br>of otago and the university of auckland<br>have a rural<br>entry pathway but the university of<br>auckland's rural entry pathway is a lot<br>broader<br>and it encompasses a lot of regional<br>places that people might not<br>on the assumption of like a rural entry<br>pathway considered to be rural<br>i mean if you're a young rural student<br>and you look up on the university of<br>auckland website you find out that you<br>qualify for that pathway<br>your chances of getting into medical<br>school have just jumped<br>there's so many university support<br>services<br>the first support service that you come<br>into contact with is your<br>ras which are resident advisors they're<br>like cooler older students that live in<br>the halls<br>if you're sick they'll help you get into<br>health and counselling if you're feeling<br>emotionally overwhelmed with the move<br>away from home or you're struggling with<br>more serious mental health problems then<br>they'll help you get hooked up with the<br>health and counselling service<br>grassroots that's the version of rural<br>health student support for the<br>university of auckland<br>we run social events we take people out<br>on early rural experiences<br>there are definitely some misconceptions<br>about what it means to be<br>a rural health professional there's this<br>old idea<br>from like so long ago of just a gp you<br>know<br>when you get a patient and they're<br>pretty sick they come to ed<br>you know they've got obvious symptoms<br>you're not limited in scope to<br>one area like the tummy or the heart or<br>the lungs you've got to look after<br>that patient's whole body the extra<br>thing that being a rural gp<br>adds is that if you're out in any sort<br>of rural small town<br>and a kid comes in with a surgical<br>emergency you don't have<br>a big hospital with all the specialists<br>that you can easily just send people to<br>it's just you<br>and the nurses and so the teamwork that<br>you have to display<br>and the work that you get to do is so<br>much more vary<br>rural students are really important in<br>health programs to promote the ongoing<br>well-being of rural communities<br>so gp be it urban or rural is a massive<br>job<br>it's going to be hard work but it's hard<br>work that you can do no matter where<br>you're from<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
