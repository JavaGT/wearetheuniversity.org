100% accurate.</p><p>welcome everyone thank you for coming<br>out<br>um we're here of course for the launch<br>of the university of otago's research<br>key<br>research theme with um some key<br>stakeholders um some invited guests<br>and of course the champions um of 12<br>12.3<br>um the champions of 12.3 is a coalition<br>of organizational representatives<br>um from across the new zealand food<br>supply chain<br>um they have committed to assist our<br>terror in achieving the united nations<br>sustainable development goal number 12.3<br>which is to half food waste by 2030. um<br>it's an ambitious goal but as you'll<br>learn we have new zealand's best minds<br>on the job um<br>so and after spending um some time with<br>this group i've been with them since<br>their inception in march<br>after spending some time with this group<br>i am confident that we'll not only reach<br>it but i think we can surpass it<br>we'll hear more from them later um in a<br>bit of a discussion<br>but first i'd like to introduce you all<br>to the division of science's pro vice<br>chancellor professor<br>richard barker and he will introduce the<br>thing<br>thanks for the introduction my name is<br>richard barker and i'm the pro vice<br>chancellor division of sciences<br>and i'm delighted to be asked to come<br>along today<br>to say a few words to help launch our<br>tanga parakai the food waste innovation<br>our latest<br>research thing i'd like to welcome the<br>food waste champions to otago<br>some of you are a resident i know one or<br>two of you and i'm looking forward to<br>meeting with you<br>later on i'd also like to acknowledge<br>the presence and leadership<br>of associate professor miranda marosa<br>over on my left<br>uh phil bremer and schiller who are on<br>the steering committee<br>uh driving this as well as francesca<br>goodman smith<br>the waste minimisation manager at<br>foodstuff so so welcome<br>and my instructions for this there were<br>i had a choice of two one said speak for<br>ten minutes the other said speak<br>two or three minutes you'd be pleased to<br>and so first thing you do when you<br>prepare for these things is you go to<br>the website just to make sure that<br>you have something appropriate to say<br>and i see the first thing that it says<br>is that the food waste is arguably one<br>of the most pressing<br>societal challenges of our time and the<br>university<br>and the division of sciences place high<br>strategic<br>importance on research that has impact<br>and this theme<br>is a perfect example it's also a great<br>example<br>of research collaboration across the<br>university community<br>i think all divisions are represented<br>and<br>we see this as a new element in the<br>division of science<br>food nutrition and health strategy which<br>is great importance to us the department<br>of food science sits<br>critically in there along with the<br>department of human nutrition<br>going to the other great source of<br>information wikipedia<br>i'm a statisticians i thought i needed<br>to quote some statistics so i found some<br>and what i learned was that households<br>in new zealand generate an average of<br>300 kilograms of organic waste per year<br>of which approximately 170 kilograms is<br>food waste and i know in my own<br>household<br>we generate a fair bit of food waste we<br>do have chickens<br>so they get a fair bit of it and i have<br>a composting heat<br>but i suspect some of it makes it into<br>kerbside<br>recycling and here's another statistic<br>that fits with the other one<br>somebody did some research where they<br>sampled<br>curbside waste and found<br>that there was an average of 300<br>sorry there was an average of three<br>kilograms per week put out by households<br>so well done to whoever took on that<br>research<br>is that you were in a smelly<br>taking a broader view total waste has<br>got to be enormous when you look right<br>across the supply chain including<br>right from from where it's produced<br>the the the theme is going to have three<br>research sub<br>themes that will tackle this problem<br>they're going to break it down into<br>three constituents parts there's<br>metrics and management understanding how<br>much food has been wasted<br>where it has been wasted and its social<br>economic environmental impacts<br>the second one is technical innovations<br>using the latest science and technology<br>to make the most of business opportunity<br>that food waste provides<br>and thirdly social innovations using<br>behavioural science to understand the<br>drivers responsible<br>for food waste in order to make<br>recommendation on minimisation<br>initiatives testing solutions and<br>providing impact<br>analysis uh if if i may finish<br>with a wakatoki hakai<br>there is food at the end of my hands and<br>according to my research this is said by<br>a person who uses their basic abilities<br>and resources to create success and i<br>thought that was entirely appropriate<br>for the launching of this new research<br>thing<br>great thank you thank you um<br>yeah i think a few of us um have been um<br>kind of into some bins figuring out at<br>least francesca and i have<br>um measuring kind of different waste<br>streams in our time um<br>yep so it's it is very smelly and<br>interesting<br>um up next um on theme i guess<br>um i'll now introduce miranda marissa<br>miranda is director of food waste<br>innovation and research leader of the<br>social innovation sub thing she is<br>an associate professor in consumer food<br>science here at the university of otago<br>miranda's behavioural research engages<br>knowledge from fields such as marketing<br>and psychology to provide<br>insights and interventions for improved<br>food system sustainability her research<br>creates<br>evidence-based solutions to help people<br>change<br>behaviours she provides academic<br>consultancy services on food waste to<br>government and businesses and is the<br>author of the marosa report<br>written for the parliamentary<br>environmental committee who ran a<br>targeted briefing on food waste in nz<br>which looks at the current status of<br>food based in aotearoa<br>and provides recommendations for actions<br>she is also co-chair of the champions<br>everybody good evening i'm sure you've<br>heard the stats globally one-third of<br>all food produced on this planet<br>is wasted which is phenomenal one-third<br>uh obviously this has huge implications<br>on the status of the planet<br>uh socially we know that one in nine<br>people globally and malnourished<br>and yet we're producing enough food to<br>feed everybody<br>uh in fact estimates are if we could<br>recover just half of the amount of food<br>that is currently<br>lost and wasted uh that would be enough<br>to feed everybody alone<br>the environmental costs of wasting food<br>are huge<br>uh in fact reducing food waste has been<br>ranked as the third best action we can<br>take globally to reduce<br>uh or to tackle climate change<br>economically uh food losing waste<br>amounts to economic losses of 940<br>billion us dollars per year so look<br>it's a major global issue and we all<br>know that that's why we're here tonight<br>right<br>uh there's lots happening globally to<br>address this issue uh some countries<br>like uk have been working<br>on this project for the good part of 20<br>years<br>uh and there's lots of new players as<br>well others like our friends across the<br>ditch in australia<br>they've been making significant progress<br>on this on this issue in recent years so<br>they published<br>their national food based production<br>strategy in 2017<br>and it's been really interesting uh to<br>watch developments um<br>over there and i guess of particular<br>interest to me with my food waste<br>academic hat on<br>has been what's happening in the<br>research space uh so they have a<br>ten-year<br>research cooperative cooperative<br>research center<br>called fight food waste this brings<br>together industry<br>research and the community to capitalize<br>on australia's food waste opportunities<br>so<br>there's lots of public and private<br>investment there's heaps like<br>123 uh<br>million australian dollars has been<br>committed towards this uh research<br>cooperative research effort to date<br>uh they've got a really ambitious set of<br>research programs<br>either funding an impressive number of<br>phds i think 3000 phd programs<br>phd projects as part of this larger<br>program<br>but tonight is all about what's<br>happening here at home<br>we are new zealanders obviously we're an<br>export<br>agricultural nation we rely heavily on<br>our clean<br>green image and our export markets so<br>we've really got every reason to be at<br>the forefront of efforts to reduce food<br>loss and waste<br>culturally we're well positioned to be<br>taking a strong stance on food waste<br>reduction<br>teo maori recognizes the traditional<br>system in which nothing was wasted<br>but i guess new zealand has also been<br>lagging behind<br>arguably we've been lagging behind<br>international efforts in addressing<br>uh this issue at a national level at<br>least but the wheels are finally moving<br>uh and and we've just heard that in<br>2018-19<br>uh the parliamentary environment select<br>committee uh ran a briefing to find out<br>more about the extent of the problem uh<br>in new zealand<br>and to learn about you know what what's<br>what's currently happening uh what do we<br>know what we don't know what needs to be<br>done to move forward in this space<br>from this we learned that food waste is<br>a pressing national issue although we're<br>not entirely sure of how much of an<br>issue<br>we don't have accurate data on exactly<br>how much is wasted at each of those key<br>steps along the supply chain<br>we heard that the waste has significant<br>environmental economic and social<br>implications<br>uh at an environment level food that is<br>landfilled releases methane which is<br>greenhouse gas and although of course<br>many of our landfills capture this<br>uh mf3 estimates are that only about 71<br>of those of that methane is captured<br>uh at the economic level food waste and<br>process costs at all stages of the the<br>life cycle<br>cost to householders from buying food<br>that's not consumed<br>the average household spends about 644<br>per year<br>on food which is bought but but not not<br>eaten<br>there's obviously costs to businesses<br>who are producing this waste<br>and and then obviously cost to local<br>authorities who are charged with<br>responsibility of dealing with the waste<br>in terms of the main social impact of<br>landfilling food waste it's obviously it<br>represents the lost opportunity<br>for distributing food to those in need<br>and covert has obviously seen a spike in<br>numbers of new zealanders that are very<br>insecure<br>but there appears to be an enormous<br>amount of enthusiasm from the submitters<br>and the organizations and businesses<br>they represent<br>to reduce food waste and there's already<br>a<br>number of fantastic initiatives<br>happening in new zealand<br>in businesses and homes we're going to<br>hear about some of those awesome<br>initiatives tonight<br>given the scale and importance of the<br>food waste issue<br>i guess new zealand really needs to work<br>in a more coordinated<br>joined up approach in order to scale up<br>these current reduction<br>activities but there's a number of<br>challenges to doing this<br>we don't yet have a national reduction<br>or food waste reduction target<br>nor do we have a food waste reduction<br>strategy nor a prioritization<br>implementation plan<br>identifying where investment and food<br>waste reduction should be targeted<br>the good news is that there exists a<br>international best practice approach but<br>how to tackle this at a national level<br>and that's a three-pronged approach it<br>involves setting a target<br>measuring waste and then acting to<br>reduce it so in terms of setting a<br>target<br>targets set ambition and ambition<br>motivates action<br>and the government has recently agreed<br>with the recommendation to include<br>reducing food waste<br>with a reduction target as part of its<br>national food waste uh<br>sorry as part of its national waste<br>strategy and implementation plan which<br>is<br>obviously fantastic in relation to the<br>second step the measurement step the<br>government has agreed with the<br>recommendation to establish a definition<br>of measure of food waste<br>and has noted that developing a national<br>food waste baseline is the first step in<br>measuring food waste<br>so mfv is currently progressing uh this<br>recommendation<br>as part of its broader waste data<br>framework<br>but look at the end of the day what<br>ultimately matters is action<br>and in relation to this third step we<br>really need to take bold measures to<br>reduce food loss and waste at every<br>stage of that supply chain<br>uh there's really something for<br>everybody something for everyone to do<br>and there's lots of recommendations on<br>what could be done<br>uh in the report on the research front<br>if we've just heard we've established<br>the food waste innovation research theme<br>which harnesses the research expertise<br>for across the arts sciences commerce<br>divisions<br>uh to help provide effective solutions<br>to new zealand's food waste problems<br>we've just heard the theme described so<br>i won't do that and the different<br>sub themes i guess what i would like to<br>say at this point is to take the<br>opportunity to to formally thank<br>a number of people so first of all<br>professor andrew away in the department<br>of food science<br>richard barker and the division of<br>sciences and of course the university<br>uh feel the support for this theme it is<br>very much appreciated<br>i'm super excited to launch the theme<br>tonight in this public forum<br>um so thank you for sharing this this<br>evening with us uh as a theme we're just<br>starting to engage externally<br>uh and tomorrow we're hosting a<br>stakeholder innovation forum where our<br>researchers are going to meet with<br>the champions to help identify priority<br>research questions that must be<br>addressed in order to advance policy and<br>practice<br>efforts and we really look forward to<br>ongoing collaboration with you all with<br>the champions<br>we also look forward to working with<br>each and individual each and every one<br>of you<br>in your different capacities there's<br>amazing breadth in the room<br>to tackle this really big but i think<br>it's a really<br>winnable issue um in terms of reducing<br>new zealand's food waste<br>um up next i'd like to introduce tessa<br>vincent<br>tessa has a law and part of its<br>background and studied here at otago<br>university<br>she founded nz food waste champions in<br>march this year<br>she is particularly passionate about<br>food waste reduction because she sees it<br>as a tangible climate change action<br>um for every new zealander to get behind<br>she's a dear friend of mine<br>and a true inspiration who works hard<br>for what she cares about um she'll be<br>here to introduce the champions<br>thank you bobby and everyone who's who's<br>turned up<br>today it's it's great to see such a big<br>crowd here<br>uh i just thought i'd give some<br>background<br>to this wonderful group of people um in<br>front of me<br>and new zealand food waste champions um<br>really came to be for for me personally<br>for two main reasons<br>so climate change is a<br>massive and overwhelming issue like<br>where do we even begin with this<br>huge global challenge um<br>but we all eat dinner every night<br>and we all have engaged with food every<br>day and<br>to me this um is an<br>absolute tangible action that every new<br>zealander can get behind<br>and it's also been ranked um through a<br>really rigorous research project as the<br>third best kind of<br>climate change action we can take so<br>that was a big driver behind<br>this organisation at a personal level<br>but for each of the champions they also<br>have um<br>kind of motivations from a social and<br>economic lens as well<br>uh the second big personal connection<br>with this was<br>i came from a political environment very<br>competitive environment<br>and i thought look we<br>need to come together and collaborate<br>more to solve<br>some of these really big issues um so<br>contacted a few people and here we are<br>today<br>in this amazing forum with 12 amazing<br>champions<br>and really looking forward to hearing<br>what they have to say and to hearing<br>thank you tessa and yeah get thinking<br>about questions while start talking<br>so you can ask the panelists after<br>um so now to introduce the panelists um<br>there's nine of the twelve here today<br>um and we'll i'll ask them to speak<br>after i introduce them<br>for a couple of minutes about about your<br>organizations<br>they are roughly in order of the supply<br>chain from production consumption to<br>disposal<br>um now this is a linear representation<br>and a very simplified understanding of<br>how food works<br>and how food waste streams work and i<br>must acknowledge that that's much more<br>fluid and dynamic than that<br>if only it was that easy so<br>first up i'd like to introduce susan<br>goodfellow<br>she is the founding director at left<br>field innovation limited<br>which is a social enterprise business<br>developing sustainable<br>diversified land use for new zealand<br>farmers<br>it aims to produce uh sorry it aims to<br>provide<br>new and novel food for consumers who<br>who care through and understanding um<br>of the value um thus linking food<br>producers and consumers creating greater<br>value for<br>yes left field innovation was<br>established because we saw a gap or a<br>challenge<br>for farmers around sustainable land use<br>opportunities and you're probably all<br>aware of some of the climate and<br>environmental impacts of food production<br>and there's a lot of pressure on farmers<br>to diversify into sustainable land uses<br>but<br>historically new zealand's need a<br>commodity producer and it's all about<br>what could we grow<br>and the farmers would do that and they<br>say well who's going to buy it and we<br>saw that it was hugely problematic<br>the idea that we introduced was we would<br>take a market led approach to say what<br>does the market want<br>and then looking at what of those raw<br>materials can we grow in new zealand and<br>then how can we turn those into<br>high-value food products<br>uh for for domestic market and for<br>exports so we've been working on this<br>for three years our target's a hundred<br>thousand hectares<br>and i think the interesting thing about<br>the food waste component of what we do<br>is matching the the farmers production<br>um and what they grow with the food<br>companies and we've learned a massive<br>amount<br>about waste and you might take wheat for<br>example we're doing a lot of work in the<br>milling wheat space at the moment<br>a lot of farmers will grow a variety of<br>wheat and then<br>then they'll sign a contract for supply<br>it's already planted<br>and they'll find that it's the wrong<br>variety and so it will go to animal feed<br>and so we're breaking that down and<br>we're<br>taking a much smarter approach when<br>we're connecting the grower with the<br>food company and we're working that out<br>before contracts are signed and before<br>the the seeds are planted so we're<br>finding that last year it was about 12<br>000 tons<br>of wheat and it was 100 used for food<br>production or<br>food use so we're really excited about<br>that um going forward in the future<br>around impacts it's all about credible<br>data<br>and we've developed a traceability app<br>that uses the data that farmers collect<br>on farm around production<br>around the water use efficiency<br>agrichemical<br>use or the reduction of use and a number<br>of things like that<br>including waste to show consumers when<br>they scan the code on the product<br>how that product has been grown and the<br>production<br>impacts of that product and i think the<br>exciting thing with being part of the<br>food waste champion group<br>is that we can deepen what we do<br>to actually find data and provide data<br>back to<br>to this group to start to communicate<br>the impact<br>thanks for that susan next up we have um<br>anna yellow<br>she's the general manager of both the<br>bio resource processing alliance<br>and seafood innovations limited and is<br>the director of<br>wool research wool industry research<br>limited<br>anna recently sorry anna previously<br>consulted as a technology scout<br>at tech transfer manager for bayer<br>she worked as a business manager at the<br>sciences for auckland uni services<br>um and ran callahan innovations global<br>export<br>expert program for the northern half of<br>the north island<br>and her own startup manufacturing<br>business which she successfully solved<br>in 2010<br>thanks very much for having me so i'm<br>going to be talking about the<br>bio resource processing alliance or bpa<br>i'm the general manager of and it's<br>basically a program<br>funded by the ministry of business<br>innovation and employment<br>and we were set up to take biological<br>by-products from the primary sector<br>and turn them into high-value products<br>for export so this was a way to get<br>more value back to the growers and the<br>manufacturers and farmers<br>we're talking about pre-consumer<br>by-products so we basically<br>undertake the research and development<br>at research organisations like<br>universities ag research which<br>specializes in<br>land-based animals and fibres<br>and dairy things like that plant and<br>food research that does<br>horticulture wine waste wine products<br>sorry<br>and seafood and we've got callaghan<br>innovations research division that does<br>a lot of robotics in chemistry<br>engineering food science and we're going<br>to scion<br>scion does a lot of biofuels<br>and bioplastics and<br>forestry research so we undertake the<br>research and development on behalf of<br>companies who usually have some sort of<br>problem that they need to get rid of<br>some byproducts and develop something<br>or an opportunity that they've seen that<br>they want to get into<br>so we're talking about products that<br>might not be good enough to export<br>there might be ugly fruits or chickens<br>or<br>some peelings from carrots once they've<br>processed carrots so we<br>we do the r d and the companies<br>commercialize the products<br>and so there it's basically a way for<br>the companies to kind of use our<br>equipment and our scientists and our<br>expertise before<br>they have to invest in it themselves so<br>we get a project to a point where the<br>company can then<br>say okay this is economic this is worth<br>doing you'll get a product into market<br>so that's that's basically what we do in<br>um next we have matt dagger<br>um he became the general manager of<br>kybosh in 2012.<br>um since then kybosh has grown um and<br>was recently nominated for the new<br>zealander of the year<br>community category awards um kybosh<br>stops quality food from being needlessly<br>discarded<br>and makes sure it reaches those in the<br>wellington region who need it most<br>thanks bobby um good evening everyone my<br>name is matt<br>um so i really love to be here i've had<br>the pleasure of working with<br>um a few of you here um on the academic<br>side<br>it's really nice to see your faces here<br>again so um kybosh<br>is a food rescue organization that<br>straddles<br>the environmental and the social<br>services sector um<br>we link up the food industry with<br>community groups that support people in<br>need so it's really taking these<br>two issues the environmental issue of us<br>quality surplus food which has been<br>needlessly wasted<br>and families individuals people in our<br>community that<br>simply don't have enough food to eat so<br>using a<br>hub model where we have several hubs in<br>wellington<br>lower huts and now a cup of tea we take<br>food from lots of different businesses<br>supermarkets factories<br>orchards logistics companies we take<br>them back to our hubs where teams of<br>volunteers<br>sort through the food they quality check<br>it make sure it's safe<br>and then that food is carefully<br>allocated as per the needs<br>of different charities and then passed<br>on to<br>the charities who in turn support their<br>clients with them um<br>it's uh we we intentionally pass to<br>organizations rather than individuals<br>because<br>it's the assistance that comes along<br>with the food bed budget advice<br>bed social workers health workers<br>education it actually makes the<br>long-term difference<br>and food is the conduit to take that<br>other assistance to them so we're really<br>careful not to create dependency<br>by just putting the surplus food out of<br>the community it's quite strategically<br>redistributed to people who genuinely<br>need it um<br>kybosh is one of around 20 different<br>organizations<br>around new zealand who are all working<br>in a similar sphere<br>um we uh currently<br>run about 40 000 kilos a month um<br>diverted from landfill and this is<br>really good quality food<br>that's instead reaches people in our<br>community who just simply don't have<br>enough money to buy good food<br>thanks matt next we have debra manning<br>she's a lawyer<br>social entrepreneur and the founder of<br>kiwi harvest and the new zealand food<br>network<br>kiwi harvest mission is simple to source<br>excess nutritious food<br>and distribute it to organizations<br>across the country that feed those in<br>need<br>and to protect the environment by<br>stopping surplus food from being<br>discarded<br>the new zealand food network was founded<br>to support food rescues food banks and<br>charities across aotearoa<br>with healthy food through the<br>aggregation and sharing of box circle<br>surplus and donated food thank you and<br>good evening<br>it's so nice to be here at the<br>university of otago<br>so sukiwi harvest was founded in 2012<br>here in dunedin<br>and on the basis of the success of the<br>model in dunedin which started from the<br>back of my car we grew to become a<br>nationwide organization<br>with branches around the country i don't<br>need to go into what food rescue is<br>because matt has just told you<br>it's collecting food from supermarkets<br>and cafes and the like<br>and distributing that to social service<br>frontline agencies who are<br>at the front line of hunger in the<br>communities<br>the new zealand food network came about<br>a couple of years ago when<br>i recognised that there was a gap in the<br>charitable food chain for donated and<br>surplus food<br>in bulk food rescues if you can imagine<br>collect food in<br>boxes and perhaps one to two pallet<br>sizes a pallet is a meter by a meter by<br>a meter<br>but they don't have the capacity to<br>collect<br>260 pallets of something and it might be<br>a chill product or a frozen product<br>which is even<br>more difficult to collect and distribute<br>and that is the extent of the waste<br>that's happening<br>in our country now so knowing that there<br>was this gap<br>i set about trying to find somebody to<br>to fund a a system whereby<br>bulk food products could be aggregated<br>in north island in the south island<br>and then distributed to food rescues<br>on an as needed and as able to handle<br>basis<br>to be then passed on into the community<br>and it was really difficult to find<br>someone to fund it<br>because two years ago food waste wasn't<br>really on anybody's radar people weren't<br>really that interested in it they were<br>pretty quiet about it they didn't want<br>to talk about it<br>there was very little data on it we had<br>a lot of anecdotal data<br>of the food that food rescues were<br>having to turn down and the food that<br>was passing through our systems<br>but there wasn't really any quantifiable<br>data at that point<br>but then of course covert hit and the<br>situation became pretty dire<br>with a lot of hospitality industry<br>closing down but<br>yeah some of our primary producers were<br>still producing the food they had<br>nowhere for it to go<br>and of course food insecurity was on the<br>rise<br>and it's going to and it's predicted to<br>rise even more through um<br>through the you know unemployment and<br>all that sort of thing that's<br>that's a consequence of it and<br>fortunately<br>one of the people that i had spoken to<br>what if the government were to fund you<br>what what would you do and so<br>during the lockdown period for and<br>beyond for five to six weeks<br>we got together and we built the new<br>zealand food network under urgency and<br>the great thing about doing something<br>under urgency is that you don't have a<br>lot of time<br>to overthink decisions you just have to<br>make them<br>and go with them and so we've learned<br>along the way um<br>but mostly we've we've had some huge<br>successes and we opened<br>our first warehouse in auckland on the<br>27th of july<br>and our second warehouse in the south<br>island will be opening towards the end<br>of this year<br>the new zealand food network serves to<br>provide a solution<br>for bulk surplus and donated food and<br>some purchasing<br>through government funding as well and<br>when i say bulk i really do mean<br>bulk so i'm talking 30 40 50 150 pallets<br>at a time of frozen fresh and<br>ambient dried products it comes into a<br>warehouse<br>and into cool stores and then food hubs<br>which are food rescues and large food<br>banks<br>go into our online system and they order<br>what is needed so what we're trying to<br>do is smooth out<br>the supply line for them and give them a<br>more<br>balanced food support package so instead<br>of getting<br>30 pallets of cream cheese in commercial<br>size<br>tubs they can get a mixture of one or<br>two or three pallets once or twice a<br>week<br>of fruit vegetable dairy<br>and you know meat products and things<br>like that so it's early days for us yet<br>but we're hopeful that if we get buy-in<br>from all of uh large businesses primary<br>producers<br>and the like that it will be a solution<br>for new zealand for both the<br>environmental<br>um aspect of food waste and of course<br>the social<br>next up we have francesca goodman smith<br>she<br>is the waste minimization manager at<br>food stuffs new zealand<br>um her role involves leading food<br>staff's national waste<br>minimization program across more than<br>130 sites<br>supporting the diversion of over 85 of<br>waste from landfill<br>and the donation of over 8 million meals<br>to local communities per year<br>francesca works across the sector to<br>explore new opportunities for reducing<br>and diverting<br>food waste delivering on the<br>organisation's corporate social<br>responsibility strategy<br>towards zero waste by 2025.<br>francesca's masters<br>research quantified retail food waste in<br>new zealand and provides baseline data<br>for this stage of this food supply chain<br>thanks bobby<br>kiyora everyone um i barely need to say<br>anything after that introduction thanks<br>very much<br>um i began my food waste journey<br>here at the university of otago a few<br>years ago<br>studying um with the department of human<br>nutrition<br>and food science supervised by sheila<br>and miranda and<br>that was an amazing eye-opening<br>experience to the potential<br>we have here in aotearoa to reduce food<br>waste<br>and it's such a pleasure to be back and<br>speak<br>now from an industry perspective and be<br>part of the food waste research theme<br>so i'm lucky to be working for<br>foodstuffs new zealand who are the kind<br>of brand owner<br>of new world pack and save and four<br>square supermarkets<br>helping them to reduce waste so they<br>began a program<br>for food waste reduction in 2014<br>and since then they have reduced all<br>waste to landfill by 45 which is quite<br>an amazing effort for an organization<br>with the scale that foodstuffs has<br>we have now got a much tighter focus on<br>what we want to do around food waste<br>reduction<br>and we have a target to send zero food<br>waste to landfill by 2025<br>and a suite of other sustainability<br>related<br>initiatives such as reporting our carbon<br>footprint<br>but to do that we can't just work in<br>isolation<br>within our own business and silo we have<br>a responsibility to work with other<br>organizations across new zealand<br>with academics with government with<br>other industry partners with the food<br>rescue sector to really drive this<br>change forward<br>and i think being part of this champions<br>coalition is such an amazing opportunity<br>to share that knowledge that everybody<br>has and<br>to really drive action to reduce food<br>waste so thank you very much for<br>hosting us today and i look forward to<br>working together and hopefully getting<br>some real results<br>thank you friendship next up we have<br>to cover rob here's the<br>for maori new zealand waste organisation<br>paracord<br>an educator waste consultant and<br>documentary photographer<br>to cover a work department to go work<br>primarily<br>with maori communities and organizations<br>to build food resilience and food<br>sovereignty<br>and minimise waste and protects the<br>living environment through affirmative<br>actions<br>informed by ancestral connections and<br>um<br>everyone did a really good job of<br>preparing their speeches i didn't i've<br>meaning many things but in this sense<br>waste and<br>kode being zero so quite literally zero<br>waste<br>we we advocate and we push and we<br>support<br>communities um to realize a world<br>without waste<br>um informed by our informed by our<br>ancestral connections<br>uh and a big part of that is through the<br>medium okay through this<br>um kai plays a critical role in all<br>everyone's identity everyone's identity<br>has has kai present in it<br>and for maori our pacific ancestors that<br>is very much so<br>um when we speak about where we are from<br>proverbs further inform us that our<br>connections uh<br>form us of our connections to what<br>sustain us<br>so when people say i am the river and<br>the river is me it is<br>a scientific level it's the molecular<br>identity the unique identity of that<br>river<br>which sustains that person that becomes<br>them but it's also the money of that<br>river<br>so we remain inherently connected to<br>these places<br>um by as maitua sheikh wilson says<br>literally eating your pepper<br>so from our world view food is not waste<br>but it can be wasted<br>when it's not treated as a tango and<br>what remains is not returned to the<br>fenwa<br>to create more crate the mahinda<br>organisation does uh<br>support whanau and communities to<br>reconnect and build deeper connections<br>to the natural environment<br>uh much of it through the connections to<br>kai so we support the development of<br>circular systems<br>around kai from soil to seed to eating<br>to returning the kind to the fenway<br>to continue that process continue that<br>cycle<br>indigenous peoples all around the world<br>have been practicing regenerative<br>emissions free lifestyles many thousands<br>of years so are the best position to<br>inform solutions to many of the world's<br>challenges<br>particularly around food waste i'm very<br>thankful to be a member of the<br>champions 12.3 um whanau<br>and mejiato yeah<br>and to contribute our world views to<br>informing how we can advocate for a<br>world without<br>wasted food that we're generating nutri<br>nutrient rich soils are empowering<br>people and local communities to be<br>creative<br>from my food basket with my food basket<br>and your food basket<br>uh next up we have nick lewis lee um<br>he's the founder of everybody else<br>everybody answers the pay as you feel<br>dining experience<br>nick completed his master's degree in<br>green economics at<br>xiaomuka college in england<br>becoming educated in the issue of food<br>waste as<br>well as witnessing various payers<br>pay-as-you-feel restaurants servicing<br>the community<br>using food directed for landfill<br>he has brought the concept to auckland<br>at two sites<br>in cave road and in onihanga and i'm<br>sure he'll<br>tell you about the other ones coming<br>thanks bobby uh kyoto good evening<br>my name is nick bluesley i am the<br>founder and general manager of everybody<br>eats<br>so we're a charitable dining concept so<br>we work almost exclusively with<br>perfectly good surplus food that is in<br>almost every case diverted from landfill<br>and what we do is we turn this food with<br>the help of<br>women volunteers into three-course<br>restaurant meals<br>and we allow the community anyone and<br>everyone to come and enjoy that and what<br>we call a pay-as-you-feel basis so that<br>means they can pay<br>whatever they like for the last three<br>years<br>probably 50 percent of our diners have<br>paid nothing for their meals so that<br>means they're<br>homeless elderly suffering substance<br>abuse<br>mental health issues you name it all<br>sorts of different things but at the<br>same time we have paying customers who<br>help to subsidise the meals for those<br>that can't afford to pay<br>and one of the reasons we're able to<br>bring these two very different<br>groups together is by providing what we<br>call restaurant quality meals so not<br>soup kitchen<br>it's not swap on a plate we work with<br>some of the best chefs in new zealand so<br>think<br>josh emmett ben bailey literally the<br>cream of the crop<br>and we turn this into what we hope are<br>really really delicious<br>and nutritious three-course meals served<br>at your table<br>um so within the sort of food waste<br>space what we're trying to do is<br>illustrate that this is not waste at<br>all this is really precious kai and that<br>we can elevate it and turn it into<br>something really really special<br>so as bobby said we started in auckland<br>uh we launched on k road<br>we started very quickly feeding 300<br>people a three-course meal so that's 900<br>plates of food in about an hour and a<br>half<br>so it's a plate of food out of the<br>kitchen every six seconds so<br>we work quickly uh and then that worked<br>really really well so we set up<br>a permanent restaurant in onihonga uh so<br>we feed people five nights a week there<br>uh and six weeks ago we launched in<br>papamua so just by taudina<br>and in two weeks we're in wellington so<br>we've got to the stage where we've kind<br>of proven that this model works<br>that the community is behind it that<br>chefs want to get behind it<br>that we have paying and non-paying<br>customers 2 000 plus volunteers<br>and hopefully we'll see you down in<br>dunedin maybe next year or<br>the year after hopefully but yeah it's<br>been really awesome being part of this<br>group<br>it's awesome to feel connected within<br>this network<br>and hopefully you guys have some<br>questions for us<br>cheers that next i'll bring up miranda<br>to talk on behalf<br>of jenny marshall um<br>so dean marshall is the sector group<br>coordinator at the waste management<br>institute of new zealand westmins um<br>and has the project and is the project<br>leader for love food hate waste um which<br>you might see a lovely poster around um<br>uh which has raised awareness of<br>household household food waste and saved<br>14 000 tonnes of food waste from being<br>diverted from landfill<br>her strengths are project management and<br>inspiring people behind a vision<br>just really quickly i mentioned earlier<br>we don't have great data for food waste<br>across the supply chain in new zealand<br>it's generally thought that in developed<br>nations like new zealand the majority of<br>food waste<br>is wasted at us at a consumer level uh<br>retailing consumer or consumer level<br>in particular um and so probably almost<br>four years ago<br>the waste man's organization in<br>conjunction with local councils from<br>around new zealand<br>i launched the library hate waste<br>campaign and this is all about providing<br>information to new zealanders<br>new zealand householders on how they can<br>reduce food<br>waste at home so it's quite practical<br>you know tips on how you can store your<br>your bread for longer and so forth and<br>jenny's made a little uh<br>video i believe what she's going to talk<br>to you through her refrigerator<br>kiara it's jenny here from love food<br>hate waste did you know that the average<br>new zealand family throws out three<br>shopping choice worth of food every year<br>that's 640 worth of food that they buy<br>planning to eat but end up wasting<br>so i'm going to take you on a tour of my<br>kitchen today to show you<br>what i do to reduce how much food i<br>waste and storage is key<br>so that's why we're going to go and take<br>a look in my fridge<br>firstly you can see that i've got a<br>lettuce crisper here and i've got some<br>cabbage inside it lettuce and cabbage<br>are both<br>great and will last so much longer if<br>they're stored inside a container like<br>this<br>and check if you've got bagged salad in<br>the summer as well take it out of that<br>bag and put it into an<br>airtight container it will last so much<br>longer you can see that i've also done<br>this with my carrots as well we did some<br>research at the university of otago and<br>carrots will last up to eight times<br>longer<br>stored in a quick container with a paper<br>towel at the bottom<br>next thing i want to show you is this<br>hummus i made this about two months ago<br>i had made more than i needed so i<br>popped it in the freezer i took it out<br>this morning<br>to defrost and i'm going to have it on<br>my toast today for lunch so you can<br>freeze hummus<br>freeze sour cream you can freeze yogurt<br>so if you've bought a bit too much just<br>pop them in the freezer and you can use<br>them at a later date<br>you can see that i've got some celery<br>here once again wrapped in a paper towel<br>in a plastic bag because it will last so<br>much longer and it won't go limp<br>and i've got some bread here bread will<br>last a lot longer in the fridge than it<br>does in your pantry but ideally<br>when we buy in bulk we freeze it first<br>and we only take it out when we need it<br>now onto the crisper drawer<br>you can see these beautiful beetroots<br>out of my garden i've kept the stalks<br>and the leaves because both of these are<br>edible<br>in our household we eat the beetroot<br>stalks we eat the cauliflower broccoli<br>stalks and there's some great recipes on<br>the love food hate white<br>website showing you how to do that and<br>you can see i've got some apples here<br>apples again last eight times longer in<br>the fridge than they do out in the fruit<br>bowl<br>speaking of fruit bowls over here you<br>can see our bananas we keep our bananas<br>separated from the rest of our fruit<br>because they released a gas called<br>ethylene which makes the fruit go off<br>faster<br>so that's why we have a second fruit<br>bowl over here and this is some tangelos<br>and lemons off our trees so you can see<br>they do look a bit better than ugly<br>if they're looking a bit better than<br>ugly then i just turned them into some<br>marmalade<br>another great tip for lemons is to take<br>those lemons squeeze them out<br>and place them into an ice cube tray in<br>your freezer and you can see i've got<br>some here<br>what that means is that during the<br>summertime when we've got we want to<br>make salad<br>juicing i've got some lemons that i can<br>easily use<br>another great tip as well before we buy<br>meat<br>we deep package it and put it into<br>slightly smaller quantities and freeze<br>it what that means is<br>that meat will never go off and it's<br>always available to us in the right<br>portion size when we need it<br>last but not least if you have got some<br>food scraps left that you can't eat<br>then obviously composting is a good<br>result we just have a little compost bin<br>here you can see some banana peels some<br>stalks in there<br>and that goes down to our garden so i<br>hope i've given you some good tips on<br>how to love food<br>that was awesome um some good tips to<br>take away um personally<br>um in the house that i live in we have<br>um<br>a koha shelf so often we saw<br>food going away so we have a shelf that<br>you can i live in a share house<br>so if you nominate a shelf at koha shop<br>we put it on there when we finish with<br>it and then<br>it's free for everyone to grab<br>nothing on all of those next up uh we<br>have<br>andrew andrew fisher he's the founder of<br>ecostock he founded ecosoc over 13<br>years ago which is new zealand's largest<br>commercial food recovery and reused<br>business<br>with the national network supporting<br>over 140 businesses<br>in 2019 echo stock joined forces with<br>pioneer energy to create eco gas<br>eco gas will support auckland council's<br>2021 rollout of household food<br>waste collection providing the pro<br>providing<br>the processing capability for the next<br>20 years which will include the<br>production of biofuels and<br>biofertilizers<br>andrew has represented nz at the apec<br>food loss and waste conference in tokyo<br>and was recently awarded the 2019 espion<br>sustainability superstar award um he's<br>got a video to play but would you like<br>to say anything<br>i'll shoot go to the video please<br>as new zealand's population continues to<br>grow<br>land becomes scarce and our natural<br>resources come under more pressure than<br>ever<br>green solutions are not just fashionable<br>they are imperative<br>sustainable circular economies are the<br>future<br>and new zealand for the most part has<br>been quick to embrace technology<br>but in one area new zealand has lagged<br>behind much of the developed world<br>and that area is what we do with our<br>food waste<br>such as peelings coffee grinds and<br>in new zealand food waste accounts for<br>over 327<br>000 tons per year which equates to a<br>busload of food waste lost to landfill<br>every 5 minutes but all that<br>is about to change our peerlings our<br>leftovers<br>our food scraps and our coffee grinds<br>now have a higher purpose<br>because they are about to start powering<br>our industries<br>our homes and fertilizing our crops<br>ecostock together with pioneer energy<br>are building new zealand's first<br>full-scale clean energy plant<br>powered by food waste at ripo roa<br>referral<br>for us is a great facility it's actually<br>bang<br>smack in the middle of north island<br>once completed in 2022 this two hectare<br>clean energy plant<br>using anaerobic digestion technology<br>will take more than<br>75 000 tonnes of organic waste each year<br>from council kerbside collections and<br>industrial food producers<br>this world-leading clean energy facility<br>will produce bio gas<br>and bio fertilizer for commercial<br>applications<br>by establishing eco gas in reparoa with<br>the commercial support of nationwide<br>growing tng global<br>the facility will showcase a commercial<br>scale<br>the provision of green energy solutions<br>and glass houses<br>commonly seen in europe and north<br>america<br>eco gas is also manufacturing bio<br>fertiliser at commercial scale<br>and this will be adapted according to<br>the nutrient requirements of farmers and<br>growers<br>and managed with the new zealand's<br>national overseer fertilizer management<br>program<br>eco gas repair will be one of the most<br>advanced clean<br>bio-energy plants in the world and will<br>utilize<br>a team of assembled global experts<br>drawing on their expertise from design<br>and operation of similar facilities<br>in the united kingdom europe and<br>australia<br>using the very latest technology and the<br>learnings from over 140 facilities<br>new zealand's first dedicated full-scale<br>plant<br>will not be playing catch-up it will be<br>leading the way<br>and demonstrating just how sustainable<br>and efficient clean energy plants can be<br>there is value in organics peelings<br>scraps<br>burnt toast and moldy products and eco<br>gas repair<br>is doing more than providing a<br>sustainable solution<br>it's revolutionizing our global position<br>in the new era of sustainable societies<br>i don't think it's right that we sort of<br>have a great environment<br>but we don't create great environmental<br>outcomes we can do both<br>we shouldn't be afraid to do both and it<br>will help other industries in new<br>zealand<br>it'll help our kids it'll help our wages<br>and help our salaries<br>and help our aspirations ecogas is<br>pioneering this critical change to give<br>new zealand communities and businesses<br>a competitive clean advantage in today's<br>world<br>eco gas innovation and excellence<br>evening i've taken up my three-minute<br>allocation so<br>i just want to say thank you to everyone<br>the champions the everyone who's come<br>this evening<br>um there's no one single silver bullet<br>solution to food waste<br>and it actually takes us all food is<br>pretty much a common language<br>worldwide food is important to us all<br>and<br>just having so many solutions on the<br>table i think it's always making sure<br>we've got more than one<br>option and there's so many good outcomes<br>to see the university involved it's<br>fantastic having worked<br>and doing a lot of work in the states<br>and in the uk<br>it is the universities which are<br>supporting and engaged<br>with the commercial businesses which are<br>assisting with that change and it's<br>it's vital i'm very fortunate with my<br>support from auckland university but<br>it's just great to see what's happening<br>here in otago<br>it drives next generation and there's<br>just so many opportunities to be<br>awesome okay um thank you everyone for<br>your introductions<br>and um for teaching us a little bit more<br>about what you're up to in your<br>organizations um<br>i'd like to open it up now for questions<br>for the panel um i'll give everyone an<br>opportunity<br>um if anyone has a pressing question now<br>to ask anything that you've got on your<br>mind<br>otherwise i've got some questions here<br>which i can um which i can<br>throw to the panel for them to answer<br>and we'll pass the microphone around<br>one question for andrew about eco gas<br>equal gas<br>with conversion into the gas and<br>plus what's called that bioparticulate<br>is there any work progressing about<br>creating a bioplastic because food oils<br>also need to<br>use in a other way this cycloeconomy to<br>make a sustainable packaging<br>side so is there any any<br>thought or strategic thinking about to<br>use those pilots<br>by product or this waste for conversion<br>in the main plastic<br>great question i probably forgot to say<br>that repair is under construction<br>back there on friday where earthworks is<br>done<br>and the tanks are coming up buy<br>bioplastics i'm working and this is<br>where we're talking about the<br>universities<br>so i'm working our language on salisbury<br>plains which are working with<br>portsmouth university and there's welsh<br>central anaerobic digest excellence and<br>there's another<br>link with baywa into germany so it's<br>happening and that's<br>i guess why i'm i make the saying that<br>uh<br>new zealanders aren't uh we're not<br>innovative but we're the best at taking<br>it to the next stage and we've got<br>edmond hillary took a climbing team<br>british until at the top of the world<br>bruce mclaren took a mini cooper racing<br>team and took it to the top of the world<br>we've got rutherford who went to<br>cambridge university and used their<br>facilities to do something<br>i want to do the same thing with you<br>know food waste in this country we don't<br>have to do the<br>mucky stuff let's lift to the next level<br>and get ahead again that's you know<br>that's what kiwi's good at doing<br>make the wheel go faster don't worry<br>about inventing another one<br>so the answer it's happening in the<br>world<br>and probably anna's probably been one of<br>my biggest uh assistants we<br>had through scion the pilot plant uh<br>it's connecting it<br>trying to avoid going back to first<br>principles again just it's been done<br>already it's actually<br>getting ourselves back into that space<br>having this facility at ripper<br>allows the academics at scion and<br>auckland and hopefully here<br>to come to us get that information and<br>have credibility when they go and talk<br>back overseas with what we've got and<br>that's what we're<br>open to okay thanks<br>what has the cover 19 situation changed<br>in<br>i think it's seen generally speaking a<br>decrease in food waste from<br>supermarket and consumer levels<br>and it's seen an increase in food weight<br>or not an increase but highlight of the<br>food waste<br>issue at um growing and<br>manufacturing animals and then we could<br>talk about that all evening but that's<br>the true answer<br>what do you think are the biggest myths<br>or misconceptions when it comes to<br>food waste so i've got some<br>debunking<br>i think new zealanders in terms of the<br>new zealand public generally<br>are still relatively unaware of the<br>environmental cost of wasting food so<br>when we talk to householders<br>uh about their food base we often hear<br>things oh it doesn't matter you know<br>it's compostable<br>it's it's natural organical you know and<br>so i think there's a general<br>generally a fairly low level of<br>understanding of the environmental costs<br>of food waste i think it's changing i<br>think love food hate waste campaign's<br>been so<br>instrumental in some of that change but<br>i do think there's a general<br>sort of public perception lift the road<br>i think there's also a misconception of<br>what the physical<br>object is that we're dealing with we<br>talk about food waste and people have<br>this concept of compost and<br>and you know scraps whereas what we see<br>in this beautiful beautiful food<br>um with you know percent of that<br>ninety-five percent of it is absolutely<br>perfect and edible and it's just been<br>needlessly discarded for around his you<br>know reasonable<br>reasons so we're trying to it's almost<br>like the conversation<br>needs to move away from food waste food<br>loss because it's not waste it's<br>also just add to that as well but<br>that we that's part of the challenge is<br>to get people to<br>consumers to appreciate that we are not<br>talking and i said it in a presentation<br>this morning we're not talking about the<br>stuff you sweep up off the floor or<br>factory<br>this is stuff that's perfectly<br>nutritious and healthy and still good it<br>just<br>looks ugly or isn't good enough to to<br>eat sport perhaps so it can be made and<br>still in another form um and i think<br>also<br>i'm not sure it's a misconception but i<br>was doing some work a few years ago with<br>the united arab emirates who are coming<br>to new zealand looking at food<br>waste because they have a really big<br>problem there because culturally<br>you'll meet to have a lot of excess food<br>waste<br>because it shows that you're you can<br>prepare yeah you provide<br>and so they've got to get over that<br>cultural barrier<br>there so maybe there's a little bit of<br>what do you see as the biggest challenge<br>small question each of you probably<br>could answer it differently<br>yeah um from where i sit in the<br>pre-consumer space it's the cost<br>of working with it the cost of moving<br>stuff around new zealand<br>the cost of the people on the front line<br>who maybe don't get paid enough to care<br>about whether something's wasted or not<br>trying to get those people on board<br>inside companies is challenging so<br>but they're really pivotal to getting it<br>right<br>i think um the thoughts i have around<br>some of the challenges i guess one of<br>the key aspects that we see is<br>the disconnection with food that<br>that's just a thing over there but<br>there's not really you know<br>we're broadly speaking i'm not going to<br>speak for you i'm just i'm speaking for<br>the experiences that we've had<br>um people don't quite understand how<br>much it takes to create<br>this apple um where it comes from how<br>far it's<br>travelled the care and the love that<br>goes into it<br>from right across the food supply chain<br>in order to get it to a place or onto<br>your table<br>i think that's been one of the on the<br>flip side one of the really highlights<br>of some of the money that we're doing is<br>supporting<br>marae to build big kamada and grow their<br>kayaking<br>there's a massive healing that goes<br>alongside all sorts of other things come<br>out and all sorts of other things<br>um uh positives come from that<br>but i think for me that's one of the key<br>things that it's transcends a couple<br>others because as well as the general<br>disconnection from the environment it's<br>an over there<br>and it's not we're not part of it next<br>question is what sorts of things<br>would you like to see the research theme<br>look at i think there's<br>a massive opportunity to harness some of<br>our<br>great tech capability in new zealand<br>and really take that to<br>a practical level in terms of food waste<br>mitigation i think debra could<br>talk to some of the advantages that<br>they've seen at the new zealand food<br>network by actually<br>using a software technology solution to<br>aid that process of food redistribution<br>and<br>i think from a supermarket level<br>especially<br>we are really looking at trialling some<br>really innovative tech solutions to help<br>streamline our processes and prevent<br>waste not only<br>at our point of the supply chain but<br>also further up and down the supply<br>chain too so<br>research in the tech tech food waste<br>so building on that really around the<br>technology and your comments probably<br>around<br>you know where food comes from in<br>provenance which is something we've<br>developed around the<br>traceability x it shows the farmer came<br>from the<br>their story the nutritional content and<br>then all the environmental impacts<br>and then farmers can benchmark how<br>they've improved over time so i think<br>there's some really exciting things in<br>that space but<br>i think the first step is that awareness<br>has to come by<br>quantifying it because it's always<br>someone else's is that over there issue<br>that well i don't throw much out kind of<br>thing<br>um and then this we can actually put<br>some numbers around what<br>the waste challenge is in new zealand<br>and then benchmark against how we move<br>forward there i think<br>this is a priority something that we<br>really need to do and the other thing i<br>find quite interesting just learning<br>that the third<br>most impactful action around climate<br>change is reducing food waste<br>you know we don't talk about that much<br>outside of this group i hadn't heard<br>that<br>around what we can actually do and then<br>you you hear about in new zealand a lot<br>of<br>changes on at the farm level around how<br>farmers should change their practices to<br>mitigate climate change impacts<br>and i think this is actually low-hanging<br>fruit around<br>if we can reduce waste all the way<br>through the supply chain but at the farm<br>level<br>wow what could we do and we can't at the<br>moment compare those two metrics because<br>we don't have the data<br>so i think that i find that really<br>exciting and a key first step<br>this might be a random question but it's<br>just regarding<br>plate waste you know when you go out in<br>restaurants you see people having a lot<br>of<br>plate waste and i just want to know why<br>your thoughts on that because<br>the food is technically being prepared<br>and ready to consume but if<br>people don't eat them you can't really<br>recycle them in a way<br>unfortunately there's always going to be<br>what you describe as plate waste you<br>know like the the restaurant is<br>anticipating<br>what you want on your plate and you're<br>ordering it hopefully accordingly<br>and being responsible with your ordering<br>and not over ordering um but yeah once<br>that food's been eaten<br>it can't be consumed by a human so what<br>we really need to do is encourage our<br>restaurants to<br>do the next best thing so the next best<br>thing after feeding food to a human<br>is feeding into an animal that's the<br>best use of their energy because humans<br>eat animals<br>and then if it's not that then you might<br>argue that it's compostable or ad<br>and the last place it wants to go with<br>landfill unfortunately most restaurants<br>put their food into landfills um that<br>with surplus food<br>so pig bins and it's hard in a city like<br>auckland because<br>you know our pig farms are miles away<br>but i have a restaurant in russell and<br>we work direct with<br>pig farmers so you know we're pretty<br>comfortable that if if you're not eating<br>it then<br>sure um also one of the great things<br>that lots of<br>people are doing like everybody eats is<br>providing a set menu so they kind of<br>know<br>exactly what they're producing they're<br>taking that choice element away<br>from it and it's also an exciting dining<br>experience to go in there and kind of<br>not know what you're going to get some<br>of the other things that<br>the hospitality industry can do is offer<br>varying<br>portion sizes at different prices so<br>people can actually choose<br>modifiable parts of the menu you know i<br>don't want fries i want to sell salad or<br>i don't want<br>sides with my dish or could i have a<br>smaller portion of meat and more<br>vegetables or<br>you know tailor that dish more to suit<br>you<br>and then placing the responsibility back<br>on consumers<br>is actually offering an opportunity to<br>take your food away with you in a doggy<br>bag<br>and miranda's done some great research<br>on on doggy bag uptake but<br>i think it's actually making it normal<br>to to actually say i don't want to waste<br>food at the end of my meal could i have<br>you know can i modify it so that i don't<br>have to do that<br>so one of the things that<br>humans have done over time is we've<br>built technologies to create abundance<br>and i guess<br>in the dining out scene abundance is<br>the buffet right so it's this really<br>proud moment i don't know 50 years ago<br>where you can create<br>you can literally have anything you want<br>at this place and it creates<br>ridiculous waste and it's the same in<br>every industry you know it's like<br>the same in automobile industry anything<br>like we have to<br>reverse all of these ridiculous ideas<br>that we had 50<br>or however many years ago to actually<br>start consuming in a responsible way<br>that's actually sustainable<br>norms around um the amount of food<br>and it's not my place to tell what i<br>what what that might look like but i'm<br>having discussions with mariah and<br>having discussions<br>with organizations who are putting on<br>spreads of kai it's about<br>coming back to the values for us and<br>having a conversation on what<br>manakitanga looks like<br>so nokia might not necessarily be just<br>the abundance of food<br>but it could be about food that's<br>then able to be used for something else<br>that's then um<br>not thrown in the bin and put in the<br>compost and put it into the motor those<br>sorts of things so it's<br>about sort of stepping back from some of<br>the issues and looking at the values<br>um that are inherent in cultural systems<br>and trying to be informed by them<br>another question uh you kind of spoke to<br>the neck of the<br>like waist hierarchy of what can we do<br>after it goes on the plate<br>and uh no offense andrew but<br>that energy recovery<br>does rightly belong at the bottom of the<br>waste hierarchies i'm wondering<br>how do you plan as a network of<br>researchers and<br>action focused people to prioritize<br>those interventions at the top of the<br>waste hierarchy<br>and not go for the low-hanging fruit<br>that is quite economically<br>um yeah<br>economically juicy as that but um and<br>no not go for interventions which are<br>relatively easy and simple to put in<br>place<br>which don't provide on really high value<br>returns i think it's about working<br>together<br>across the food supply chain and there's<br>so many opportunities<br>that can arise from having conversations<br>between different parts and i think<br>that's what this network can really<br>provide<br>for example i'm sitting there and you<br>know<br>working for a retailer and we've got<br>people from further up the supply chain<br>who have really strong connections with<br>the production<br>sector and we can work together to think<br>about you know how can we change our<br>ordering systems<br>to actually design waste out of the<br>system and we've got a representative<br>james from<br>sustainable business network and he you<br>know has a massive connection of<br>really innovative companies who<br>are kind of at the forefront of<br>providing some of those<br>um i guess solutions that are making a<br>circular economy out of<br>waste and re-defining waste as a<br>resource rather than as a<br>as a waste of item<br>um i think there is an element of it<br>um which comes to meeting<br>where it's at at the moment and that's<br>why there is a place<br>for things like large scale um<br>food waste collections because from a<br>household level<br>at the moment you know you can't<br>necessarily turn that back into food<br>product that can feed people<br>at the moment so it's sort of it's<br>actually about what andrew said before<br>it's providing solutions<br>that are varied that<br>can work at different levels of the food<br>supply chain but i think<br>we're never going to get anywhere if<br>everyone's working on the problem<br>within their own little silo we need to<br>have those conversations so<br>yeah that's what i would say about it i<br>think it's um it's about<br>coming together around that common goal<br>of reducing food waste<br>and taking steps in that direction and<br>yes some might be about diversion to<br>start off with<br>um but with the overarching goal of<br>um from where i sit at the um<br>at the manufacturer and processor end it<br>has to be economic<br>that i've never come across a company<br>who just does it because it sounds good<br>you know it it's too expensive to do it<br>so it has to be<br>something that can make the money which<br>i think is a good outcome because it<br>increases<br>revenue from new zealand which grants<br>jobs and things like that so you've got<br>to start somewhere<br>for them and which i think is also a<br>great outcome for the environment too<br>and for the people so as long as food's<br>not being<br>wasted in the first instance i was<br>talking to<br>an organization called the upcycled food<br>association which um francesco is<br>involved with<br>and the question for that's about um<br>educating<br>people about how it's it's still okay to<br>eat these sorts of things that<br>it's perfectly good um and the question<br>to them was<br>are you allowing companies who've maybe<br>used two percent of<br>upcycled food in their product to um be<br>a member and they said look if they're a<br>big company who uses tons and tons of<br>tons of stuff<br>that's better than nothing so you know<br>for those companies they have to start<br>calling<br>one of the things the coalition has been<br>doing is advocating government uh for<br>adoption of<br>12.3 um and<br>with relation that citizens group's got<br>a petition that has had a petition out<br>at the moment which has over a thousand<br>signatures from the new zealand public<br>supporting uh this which is<br>the asking government whoever they may<br>be to to um commit to adopting this<br>target within the first 100 days of<br>being in government secretary<br>yep um so if if new zealand does sign up<br>to this international commitment and<br>then makes a national<br>commitment um there are a number of<br>destinations for waste which<br>is helped um as making progress towards<br>this target so<br>so food waste only sort of counts in<br>terms of progress towards this target if<br>it is kept in the human and animal<br>supply chain<br>so food which is either recovered<br>through food vegetable organizations or<br>food which is um sent to<br>which is upcycled or you know it has<br>some sort of<br>higher value add to it orford which has<br>turned into animal themed<br>so these other destinations uh while<br>better than landfilling they won't<br>technically<br>count towards new zealand's making<br>progress towards that target<br>um so i think that might be i guess a<br>policy lever<br>to help with prioritization of<br>disposal alternatives if that makes<br>sense<br>we still think of waste as being<br>thrown away and it's gone and i just<br>wondered<br>i'm excited about this group coming<br>together about how we can change the<br>perception<br>that waste is a resource and i just<br>wonder<br>if anyone have any thoughts about that<br>from where matt and i sit in the reusing<br>food we don't call it waste it's good<br>because for someone it's a meal and it's<br>to coin a phrase used by a<br>method used by um other organizations<br>it's<br>we want it to be mana enhancing as we<br>pass food along to other people so we<br>don't use the word waste<br>and we want people to see the value in<br>it<br>i don't know what your steps are matt<br>but keeping harvesters since we started<br>in dunedin<br>have done the equivalent of 14 million<br>meals<br>something that was considered to happen<br>in value and you would be<br>getting up there as well given that kyle<br>wash was the first food rescue in new<br>zealand<br>so for us it's about educating people<br>that there is this value in food and<br>it's also about educating them and i'll<br>take your point<br>that let's feed people first that's that<br>should be our priority<br>with with food that we can reuse<br>anybody else have something to comment<br>on them i could but i'm hogging them<br>um yeah we're the same we don't use the<br>word waste so much anymore<br>it's easy to describe it but we talk<br>about secondary streams and<br>fire products and stuff and also<br>the cycle food association that i was<br>talking about<br>they're trying to find a place on the<br>supermarket shelf for upcycled foods<br>just like gluten-free and organic so<br>people know where to find it so that'll<br>be a<br>helpful thing um so there's no shame in<br>it it's actually be proud<br>um you'll be pleased to know certainly<br>in the primary sector<br>there's a real focus on whole of<br>resource use so<br>not not harvesting more but using<br>everything<br>so that will become the norm so you're<br>not not making bigger farms and you're<br>not<br>more fish or whatever you're just using<br>more with everything being more<br>resourceful<br>yeah i guess for me i see it as a<br>resource if you take uh<br>in england companies like mine are<br>actually buying waste now<br>because we've transitioned it to<br>plastics to co2 so<br>that technology is out there and you you<br>could see it's a resource<br>i see it as a resource recovery for<br>riparoa it's going to replace<br>imported synthetic fertilizer imported<br>co2<br>these are things we're dependent on from<br>overseas so we've got the resource and<br>it's just<br>across this format and as a resource we<br>talked about earlier on it's a<br>energy and housing sort of get uh<br>popular but food's actually quite<br>essential but it's sort of<br>quite a lot of the campaigning from the<br>love food hate waste campaign has been<br>around<br>i guess re-educating consumers<br>originating consumers on what is<br>wasted and so forth so in terms of um<br>that runs in campaigns like<br>complete it eat it eat it complete it i<br>can't remember the<br>but you know showing um consumers it's<br>okay to eat things like broccoli stalks<br>or you know<br>carrot peelings or some of these things<br>that would typically have been wasted at<br>a household level<br>um i know because they ran a campaign<br>earlier this year<br>uh with meat and it was able to eat the<br>whole beast and it was all around the<br>promotion of awful and<br>not individually one meal but<br>but you know it was all around um i<br>guess educating consumers to eat some of<br>these foods that would have typically<br>been wasted so just reconceptualizing<br>the idea in the mind of the new zealand<br>what kind of work is the university<br>doing on a practical level to implement<br>all this really awesome<br>ideas and work that you guys are coming<br>up with does anyone know what the<br>university itself<br>is doing to take on so take on this<br>and you know make practical change to<br>lead by example<br>the university is taking the food waste<br>issue seriously they're running some<br>initiatives in the halls are they're<br>actually funding<br>we have some funding from the waste<br>management<br>contract that they collect universities<br>waste and then put some universe<br>some money into the university to fund<br>summers scholarships<br>so there is one this year um we're<br>working with this the student's going to<br>be working with seamless<br>uh looking at measurement of food waste<br>in the university's colleges just as a<br>starting point so<br>we don't even have daily very good data<br>in terms of how much has been produced<br>at that level<br>um i know there is a group of student<br>leads working through the sustainability<br>office that is<br>going to pick up on that and run with<br>some initiatives in the colleges next<br>year<br>which is really exciting they are<br>funding<br>one of the students here in the room<br>actually who's a third year consumer<br>food science<br>student she's going to be working over<br>summer 18 anniversary looking at<br>developing a toolkit for students<br>in their flats to provide some advice on<br>how to reduce very waste at that level<br>yeah i think we so the waste management<br>group actually have<br>a person here at the university um who<br>is based here at the university<br>uh is funded through them and is really<br>came to promote waste reduction<br>so there hasn't been much in the past<br>but i'm confident that there'll be<br>more moving forward um and i guess as<br>part of the research then we're really<br>keen to see some action on the ground as<br>well as at a research level so we'll<br>definitely be<br>promoting and advocating for that as<br>well<br>and if you've got any really good ideas<br>the university have been donating um<br>their surplus food from their cafes and<br>their events<br>since uh kiwi harvest first started here<br>cool okay um thank you everybody for<br>your questions<br>sure yeah that's great i just wanted to<br>thank trixie crowe who's up here at the<br>front uh<br>trixie is the manager for the food waste<br>innovation theme<br>and has been the one that has been<br>sending out emails to everybody and has<br>organized<br>tonight's event and we're super excited<br>to have her on board she's a master's<br>student<br>in the department of sociology working<br>with hugh campbell<br>and myself and so and and just come to<br>us from a food rescue background so it's<br>really<br>well positioned to be to be managing the<br>thank you champions um for kind of<br>lifting the profile and building<br>integrity within our food within our kai<br>um<br>so thank you very much for all that and<br>your time tonight answering questions<br>um please hang around ask some questions<br>privately if you like<br>um we'll have a drink and i think<br>there's food there<br>to enjoy we'll also be going to<br>umbrellas<br>um for dinner post this if anybody would<br>like to join<br>um so yeah mix member and enjoy yourself</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
