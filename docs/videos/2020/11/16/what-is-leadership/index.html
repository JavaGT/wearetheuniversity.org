I teach the user experience courses <br>and the game development course. I'm working in  <br>the area of artificial intelligence mainly focus <br>on evolutionary computation for machine learning  <br>to solve various real-world problems. Bringing <br>everybody along and in finding ways to actually  <br>make things happen is tricky and it requires a lot <br>of thinking a lot of understanding of really human  <br>psychology and and behaviour how best we do bring <br>everybody along to make the changes that we need.  <br>I think we can be a leader at any age, yeah, <br>you just have to be more confident with yourself  <br>and put your hands up. I think you need to have a <br>passion so leadership is not an end in itself, you  <br>don't just be a leader, you lead in a certain area <br>because it's something you care about. It's about  <br>a team working together and rather than one person <br>being the pinnacle of the entire system it's about  <br>everybody contributing with their expertise. What <br>I've learned about leadership - it's often about  <br>listening and it's about understanding <br>other people's ideas and viewpoints.  <br>Leadership is not about telling everybody else <br>what to do it's about listening to others and  <br>seeing a way that we can all agree on as to how <br>to proceed into the future, so you don't have to  <br>be that super confident person, you have to be <br>good at identifying the skills in other people,  <br>you'd be good at motivating those people, and <br>you'd be good at collecting that information  <br>and shaping it. Leadership is actually <br>about the team rather than the individuals.  <br>I think the most rewarding part is I found my <br>leadership has been recognized by others and  <br>inspiring others to be a leader so that's given me <br>a lot of encouragement and passion to keep going  <br>and training new leaders in the future in the <br>area. Part of our roles as academics is helping  <br>people go from consuming and being a follower <br>right to being a creative leader so I agilify my  <br>courses so I actually put the lecture topics into <br>a backlog and the students get to pick what topic  <br>comes next so that I have a shared leadership <br>model so to be a good leader I think three things  <br>that are really important are communication, you <br>have to have passion, and also about critical  <br>thinking - being able to think about your <br>own role and how that helps other people.<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
