Sydney is from the United States and is studying a Master’s degree at Victoria University of Wellington. Her advice: “Don’t be afraid of taking a chance. Moving across the globe is not as challenging as it seems and you’re also not as far away as you think you are.”</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Scene one. Take one<br>My name is Sydney Dean I'm a masters student <br>in the school of biological sciences I'm an  <br>American citizen who came over about <br>a year ago and I have a passion for  <br>reptiles amphibians and their conservation.<br>I was very into theatre and things like that <br>so the fact that I turned towards nature  <br>science things that were a little more <br>labor-intensive was very funny to my family.<br>I had the choice to go to New Zealand or Ireland <br>and I chose to come to New Zealand to take my  <br>course. While I was here it instilled a <br>passion in conservation sustainability  <br>and how seriously that's taken by not only New <br>Zealand government but also the people who are  <br>invested in it in their daily lives and I chose to <br>come back to do my masters here for that reason.  <br>I really loved coming to New Zealand because <br>I grew up in the smoky mountains in Tennessee  <br>and that was very hard for me to leave. Leaving <br>your family is one thing - you know that you're  <br>going to see them again you can call them as <br>soon as you land. Leaving the mountains was  <br>very different for me - it was one of the first <br>times I was leaving long term I would be very  <br>much out of my element not only culturally but <br>just living in a place that felt very different  <br>and when I arrived in New Zealand I saw all of the <br>mountains of New Zealand and so it felt instantly  <br>familiar to me, comfortable, I knew that I was <br>still protected and taken care of by mother earth.<br>I really loved wellington because it's a very <br>inclusive community it has a lot of events going  <br>on, it's very lively but it's not too chaotic. <br>It's a nice city to be in for your day-to-day life  <br>and it sort of transitions a little <br>bit on the weekend to a nice relaxed  <br>fun environment and it's also surrounded <br>by nature so it's great because whenever  <br>the city does become a little too much <br>you're able to pop away into the forest.<br>I chose the University of Wellington because <br>as a masters student going into a project it's  <br>very important to know that your research <br>interests align very closely with your  <br>supervisors when thinking about the University <br>of Wellington in regards to other universities  <br>I knew that by coming here I was going to be <br>given perhaps more opportunity to work with  <br>the Department of Conservation, regional councils, <br>city councils, so I knew that I was going to have  <br>a great education as far as theory, I was going <br>to be learning from really accredited professors  <br>researchers who have been publishing a lot <br>recently that looks great in the science field,  <br>but that I would also be offered opportunities <br>and support to do my own research successfully  <br>that would set me up with a network to <br>continue on after graduation. I have  <br>never been to an institution that has so much <br>support for students not only in their academic  <br>lifestyles but outside of university as well <br>so whether that's finding a job to support you  <br>while you're in study or once it's time for you <br>to move out of your study via graduation and into  <br>you know your official career whatever <br>that may be as well as your well-being.<br>If I could give my younger <br>self advice I would tell her to  <br>not be so afraid of taking a chance taking a risk.  <br>Moving across the globe is not as difficult as <br>it feels, it's not as challenging as it seems,  <br>and you're also not as far away as you think you <br>are. So contacting home very easy, and getting  <br>back home is easier than you think because you <br>start to establish a little home wherever you  <br>go- you'll always find people to support you. And <br>- to dive into the career that I thought that I  <br>wanted, and to just go ahead and make that switch <br>into conservation - I knew I wouldn't regret it.<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
