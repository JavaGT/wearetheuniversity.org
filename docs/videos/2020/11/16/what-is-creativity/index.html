Meet Dr Natalie Plank, Bobby Luke, and Raqi Syed from Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>As a physicist I would say people don't often look <br>at me and think 'oh she must be really creative',  <br>but actually I spend my life-solving <br>problems, thinking of ways of doing things,  <br>designing things. Every big discovery <br>is coming from a creative mind who's  <br>thought a little bit differently <br>and done things their own way.  <br>I'm in my last six months of my Ph.D., and it <br>is around how can we use touchpoints and memory  <br>growing up as a child as a form of methodology <br>to recreate things nostalgic. When you're in the  <br>process of being in a creative space you kind of <br>zone out, everything just becomes a halt for me. I  <br>think uncertainty and allowing yourself to embody <br>a position of uncertainty leads to discovery  <br>and it's an uncomfortable place to be but I <br>feel like that's where I get my best ideas.  <br>Creative thinkers - you can't be too fixed on <br>sticking to one thing and kind of having tunnel  <br>vision you have to be able to think right now we <br>need to change now we need to adapt. It's really  <br>rewarding when you have that kind of eureka we've <br>solved that moment you know when things really  <br>work. Here at the University we teach and we do <br>research in VR. What an amazing thing to be at the  <br>beginning of a medium like it's like the 1800s all <br>over again and we're trying to do something new  <br>and we're sort of collectively learning about <br>it and figuring out what is, this new language,  <br>how is it powerful, how can we tell stories in <br>it? It's about collaboration, co-designing, and  <br>all of these creative thinking and that's what's <br>most important, is building the relationships  <br>for your creative outlets. If we don't have the <br>relationships it doesn't have any substance to  <br>it. It could be creative, it could be academic, <br>it could be scientific, it could be creative - you  <br>need to be a master of these things because <br>your creative outputs become more advanced as  <br>you develop those skills. You really have to use <br>all parts of your brain and think about how you  <br>can apply things, how you can make things better, <br>and what you can do. My mom has no idea what I do.<br>I tried to explain, she's like - "oh that's <br>nice". I don't get up and say to myself that I  <br>don't like what I do and I think that's the beauty <br>of being in a creative space because you love it.  <br>I really believe that creativity is a muscle <br>and that like anything else, we exercise it  <br>and then we come to embody it so I believe <br>that creativity is a learned process - like  <br>sure there's a spark that inspires you to go down <br>that path but in terms of staying on the path and  <br>doing creative work as a sort of like calling <br>that's just like exercise that you do every day.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
