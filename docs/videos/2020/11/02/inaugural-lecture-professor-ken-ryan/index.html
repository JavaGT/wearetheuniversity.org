It looks bleak, cold, and lifeless. But it hosts a profusion of microorganisms, including phytoplankton and bacteria, that are a crucial food store for marine life in polar oceans. Because they endure many challenging and localised stresses, sea-ice microbes are the proverbial 'canary-in-the-coal-mine' and provide a fascinating insight into future environmental change.<br><br>Professor Ken Ryan from the School of Biological Sciences will summarise three decades of climate change research on sea-ice microbial communities, bringing together research by his postgraduate students and international colleagues.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100%

of<br>science<br>my name is professor grant guilford vice<br>chancellor of taharangawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>and it's my honor to host you all here<br>tonight<br>professor ryan has over 40 years<br>experience as a top<br>class research scientist after<br>completing his phd<br>at this university in 1980 professor<br>ryan went on to work as a scientist at<br>dsir<br>and industrial research limited before<br>returning to the university in 2002<br>during his career kean has undertaken<br>research in a number of areas<br>from antarctic climate change biology<br>to freshwater cyanobacteria to kiwifruit<br>pollination<br>over 30 years he has made many<br>significant contributions to the study<br>of antarctica and climate change<br>including work that helped lead to the<br>award of the nobel prize the<br>intergovernmental panel on climate<br>change in 2007.<br>this antarctic research has included as<br>many as 16<br>trips to remote areas of antarctica the<br>supervision of nine phd students and<br>five master students<br>from both new zealand and australia and<br>50 million dollars in funding from the<br>antarctic science platform<br>professor ryan

unique stresses<br>they face in their antarctic environment<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>please join me in welcoming the<br>wonderful professor ken ryan to the<br>podium<br>well thank you all for coming to nakoto<br>tenacotto<br>tennekoda couture welcome everybody<br>friends family colleagues special guests<br>a vice chancellor<br>professor grant gilford our program our<br>pro vice chancellor<br>professor essan<br>and provost professor wendy lana<br>thanks again everybody for coming i'm<br>very pleased to see<br>such a crowd turning up for me<br>so i thought i'd begin let's just get<br>this pointer<br>so i thought i'd begin by acknowledging<br>some two very important colleagues that<br>i've<br>worked with for many many years firstly<br>professor andrew<br>mcminn from the university of tasmania<br>we've been working together in<br>antarctica for probably about 25 years<br>and<br>published lots and lots of papers and i<br>can't even remember how many we've<br>we've published so we're very proud to<br>be part of a collaboration with him<br>and the second andrew is andrew martin<br>who i hope is somewhere in the audience<br>i'm not sure there he is<br>yet hi andrew and he did a phd with me<br>he was my very first phd<br>student and i'm very proud to<br>acknowledge such an excellent scientist<br>as developed from<br>so i thought i'd tell you a little bit<br>about myself<br>so i attended the tiharpai<br>program and i managed to learn at the<br>university how to finally pronounce<br>the name of my little country town that<br>i came from<br>it's called matari we used to call it<br>matri<br>but is a proper pronunciation so thanks<br>to the tihapai program for that<br>and i imagine that none of you have ever<br>heard<br>of it it's on the uh forgotten highway<br>between stratford and uh towards<br>tomorrow<br>so i did my phd as professor guildford<br>said<br>at victoria university<br>and i finished at about 2080<br>1980 i should say and joined<br>joined the physics and engineering<br>laboratory out at dsir<br>which has now become the callaghan<br>institute<br>and it was when i was there i was<br>surrounded by physicists<br>engineers chemists<br>and hardly any biologists so i was a<br>token biologist in lots of different<br>programs<br>and we were we spent a lot of time just<br>chasing money<br>different sources of money for different<br>topics so electron microscopy x-ray<br>analysis wood preservatives all sorts of<br>different things and stumbled across<br>antarctic algae and climate change and<br>quite a lot of other things that i can't<br>really remember<br>then came here in 2002 and<br>have had excellent students working in<br>lots of different areas particularly<br>freshwater<br>cyanobacteria and continued on<br>with antarctic algae and climate change<br>so climate change so you've all seen<br>headlines like this we're doomed<br>in the guardian tipping points<br>sea level change carbon release<br>and just a couple of days ago on stuff<br>apparently earth's going to be<br>uninhabitable<br>in fact there's a there's a great<br>article<br>in new york magazine 2017<br>called the uninhabitable earth if you<br>want to read something scary about<br>climate change have a read of that one<br>and to give you a little bit of a taste<br>here's the opening line it is i promise<br>so that's been the focus of<br>my research is climate change and<br>been lucky enough to have a number of<br>trips down south<br>some with the australian program where<br>i've managed to go<br>on to various of the australian bases<br>and with the new zealand program in the<br>ross sea<br>and one of the main places that i've<br>visited<br>is a place called cape evans which is<br>about 30 km from scott base i expect<br>and quite a nice place to visit very<br>beautiful spot<br>it's got captain scott's hut that he<br>left for<br>on his way south to the pole<br>and it's got a beautiful glass here a<br>barn glass here<br>and some very suitable sea ice that<br>we've spent many years<br>drilling many holes in this is sea ice<br>here so we're standing on sea ice sets<br>perhaps one and a half to two meters<br>thick<br>now it looks pretty bleak pretty barren<br>not much to see<br>there but if you go underneath and look<br>back<br>up you'll see all of this stuff<br>brown gunk phytoplankton<br>bacteria growing on the underside it can<br>get<br>really thick and if you look closely<br>here<br>and see these little bubbles actually if<br>once you've got your eye and you'll see<br>bubbles all over the place<br>and that's oxygen bubbles of oxygen<br>phytoplankton the plant cells they<br>undergo photosynthesis<br>they make food carbohydrate and they<br>produce oxygen so it's a pretty<br>important environment<br>because it becomes what i like to think<br>it's food for everything else in<br>ice-covered regions of antarctica and in<br>the arctic<br>sea ice algae really important<br>ecosystem<br>so i talked about grass of the sea<br>there it is there what's that beeping<br>room will shut down in 50 seconds<br>extend by one hour there we go that<br>so there's our grass and<br>these guys krill amphipods<br>mostly amphipods there they're our sheep<br>no busy<br>upside down grazing on this grass<br>munching away<br>and they become food for penguins for<br>fish<br>for whales<br>so i i think it's a pretty important<br>ecosystem<br>and some of the questions that i've been<br>asking and what might happen under<br>future climate change<br>and how does the sea ice microbial<br>community respond to environmental<br>stresses<br>so i've mentioned the word phytoplankton<br>mentioned the word photosynthesis a few<br>times photosynthesis is a process<br>that plants and phytoplankton use<br>to take energy from the sun to make<br>carbohydrate<br>and produce oxygen and in fact if you<br>total up all of the<br>production of phytoplankton in the<br>marine environment<br>all around the world phytoplankton<br>produce about fifty percent of our<br>oxygen<br>and they become the primary food source<br>for pretty much everything else in the<br>marine environment<br>and they're generally green<br>because they contain a pigment called<br>chlorophyll<br>you can even see it from space so here's<br>an image of the south island here<br>you can see on the west coast the east<br>coast<br>you can see blooms of phytoplankton<br>so how do we go about getting into that<br>stuff none of us are divers<br>so we generally drill down through<br>sometimes we'll use a coring drill and<br>drill right through from the top<br>to get a complete ice core generally<br>we'll use a what we call a jiffy drill<br>it's basically<br>it's a post hole drill this is andrew by<br>the way<br>and uh this is neville uh neville's our<br>technician in sbs so both of them come<br>south with me a couple of times<br>andrew's been down nearly as many times<br>as i have<br>and so we drill through the ice and<br>go about three quarters of the way<br>through put a coring drill in<br>and core the last little bit so this is<br>our field site here this is experiments<br>we were doing in<br>2018 this is mount erebus you've<br>probably heard of mount erebus<br>those of you may recall about erebus air<br>disaster where a plane crashed<br>about where the red dot is they thought<br>they were flying pretty much directly<br>overhead<br>they were about 50 kilometers off course<br>over here in the background is scott's<br>hut<br>so it's a pretty historic place<br>so i've got a video to show you next<br>and some of this video was produced by<br>some teachers who accompanied andrew and<br>i on our trip in 2018<br>and they did a virtual field trip for<br>school children<br>back here in new zealand and did regular<br>reports every day<br>back to new zealand and they did lots of<br>filming for us so we've got some nice<br>video<br>now normally we'd only use two people to<br>do this drilling but i can't remember<br>who that third person is but it was<br>obviously somebody who wanted to be in<br>the video<br>so here we go this is what we do we<br>drill down with this<br>and put it together put it in that hole<br>and drill out a core sample from the<br>last<br>50 centimeters or so wrap it in a black<br>place a black blanket put it in a black<br>plastic bag and take<br>we cut the end off and do our<br>work with us this is shelley who is the<br>teacher who came south with us<br>and she's making a much bigger hole<br>using a hot water<br>cutter and that's hot water squirting<br>out the end of that wand<br>took us about 30 hours to drill through<br>we've got six pieces there's one of them<br>to take out once they were all out then<br>we put a tent over the top<br>and we've got a pretty scary hole in the<br>ice this is<br>we had it covered most of the time and<br>yeah it's a big hole because we wanted<br>to put some instruments<br>down through the ice and i'll tell you<br>about that a little bit later<br>so you can see some algae on the<br>see pretty clear water down to the<br>bottom<br>this is a camera going through the hole<br>and looking back up underneath at the<br>algae growing on the underside<br>this is a video from aniwa<br>robot underwater robot with a pretty<br>decent camera<br>it's looking up at one of the<br>experiments we were doing in 2018 i'll<br>tell you a little bit about that later<br>and there's a couple holes you can see<br>the shadow of a tent here<br>and that hole often got visited by<br>a widow seal which is annoying<br>and this has got nothing to do with<br>anything i'm working on<br>this is a tina four but we think it's<br>pretty beautiful so i thought i'd show<br>you<br>that image so<br>here's that one of those hunks of ice<br>and physical conditions and sea ice are<br>really variable which makes them a<br>really<br>good way of a good<br>working environment for us it gives a<br>range of different<br>physical conditions temperature light<br>levels and so forth<br>so near the surface there are algae and<br>bacteria that grow near the surface<br>of sea ice not so many but it's a pretty<br>extreme environment there's a lot of<br>it's highlight quite salty water around<br>the ice crystals<br>and it's really really cold close to the<br>ice water interface it's at the freezing<br>point<br>of sea water which is about minus 1.8<br>degrees<br>so it's low temperature but it's stable<br>it's low light<br>and we get a lot of biomass at the<br>bottom<br>so a range of physical conditions all<br>so i want to tell you about some work<br>that andrew martin did so as i said my<br>very first<br>masters and phd student and<br>i decided we decided we're going to do<br>some work<br>on effective light intensity on the<br>growth rate<br>of sea ice algae and andrew came up to<br>me and he said<br>i'd like to do some work on the effect<br>of light intensity<br>on the growth rate of sea ice bacteria<br>and i looked at him and i started to<br>think i wonder whether i've made a<br>mistake with a student<br>because as you all know bacteria are<br>sconce grubblers right<br>they just they decay stuff they<br>they rot things away they don't respond<br>to light andrew<br>so i decided okay fine well it's it's<br>it's time for a<br>for a lesson forum you know<br>you can't you can't just ignore existing<br>knowledge you've got to build on it<br>that's what scientists do<br>so okay i told them you're going to get<br>a flat line you're just going to get a<br>graph<br>perfectly horizontal flat line but let's<br>do it good lesson for you<br>andrew fed these bacteria from sea ice<br>he fed them<br>a substrate that's a two-part molecule<br>and if there are active cells present<br>there if they've got enzymes that are<br>working<br>then the enzyme will cleave that<br>molecule<br>and release a dye that becomes bright in<br>the microscope and we can<br>three days i think doing this experiment<br>is a long time<br>that was andrew by the way so<br>increasing light levels here<br>and percentage of metabolically active<br>cells<br>you can see a steady increase<br>of bacterial cells responding to light<br>just<br>and so i thought here's a good<br>opportunity<br>to give them another lesson about<br>science<br>so that graph led to four phds and two<br>masters theses<br>and those are the the people there so<br>andrew got a<br>the thing about this graph was was that<br>it<br>it set us on a path for for new ideas<br>so perhaps the algae responding to<br>lights<br>producing lots more sugars some of those<br>leak out of the cells<br>and feed the bacteria that explains it<br>or maybe cyanobacteria are there<br>phototrophic bacteria maybe<br>bacteria that can utilize light in a in<br>a different way from<br>oh i should mention by the way we<br>fairly quickly discovered that that<br>metabolic dye didn't<br>actually work it responded to light we<br>could have done that same experiment<br>without any bacteria<br>and we would have got the same results<br>so photosynthesis complicated reaction<br>i just put that up to scare you yeah<br>we're not going to do that<br>if you want to understand about<br>photosynthesis come along to one of my<br>plant biology lectures<br>some of those students in the audience<br>will probably remember them<br>so we're going to talk about a light<br>harvesting protein<br>called proteoradoxin<br>predator adoption similar uh protein<br>that we've got in our eyes we call it<br>rhodopsin and in<br>humans proteirodopsin is a<br>membrane-bound<br>protein that exists in bacteria<br>so this is a bacterial cell here<br>and we've got this protein proteoradoxin<br>embedded in the membrane<br>now all it does is when light<br>photons hit that protein it changes its<br>shape slightly<br>and as a result a hydrogen ion or proton<br>is able to pass from inside of the cell<br>to the outside of the cell<br>that happens over and over and over and<br>over again and you end up with<br>lots of hydrogen ions on the outside of<br>the cell and not so many inside<br>we get a chemical gradient or electrical<br>gradient<br>and those protons will want to get back<br>into the cell they can't get through the<br>membrane the membrane's imperviable<br>and permeable to protons but it will<br>pass<br>through another membrane-bound protein<br>that's<br>also an enzyme that catalyzes the<br>production<br>of atp atp for the biologists in the<br>organ<br>in the audience will know that's energy<br>molecule in cells<br>it drives just about everything in cells<br>so here we have<br>a very simple system where light<br>can be trapped in an energy molecule<br>within the cell<br>we at that time when andrew did his<br>experiment<br>we actually knew about this this<br>compound<br>and we were hoping that we would find it<br>in sea ice algae nobody had done or sea<br>ice bacteria nobody had done that work<br>anywhere in the world before so<br>we thought particularly in an extreme<br>environment<br>like the top of the sea ice those guys<br>are likely to be growing there<br>so their presence and their significance<br>so set a couple of students onto that<br>sort of work island co who's currently<br>at university of singapore rebecca kowi<br>two phd students and they had a go at<br>finding this stuff<br>using different sorts of methods<br>and we've managed to isolate a few<br>clones so there's one<br>there and we looked in sea ice and we<br>found<br>plenty of proteodops and containing<br>bacteria<br>within sea ice most of them tend to be<br>at the bottom although we found them<br>now recall that underneath here there<br>are sea ice algae they've got<br>chlorophyll in them<br>and chlorophyll reflects green<br>so we would expect these<br>bacteria if they've got proteoradoxin in<br>them<br>to respond to green light<br>so another student david burr decided to<br>do some experiments<br>where he got some cultures of a known<br>proteodoxin-bearing bacterium<br>and put them in tubes and cover the<br>tubes with different colored plastics<br>and i think he drilled several hundred<br>holes<br>and put a tube in each one after a<br>couple of weeks<br>pulled the tubes back out and we<br>confidently expected that we'd get more<br>growth<br>in the green and maybe the blue colored<br>plastic<br>tubes and so<br>that's indeed what we found this is cell<br>density here<br>the higher up that scale we go<br>the more cells have grown if we grew<br>them in the dark<br>not very many cells grew at all we grew<br>them under red light it was pretty much<br>the same<br>as being in the dark they grew but<br>not so well but we found that green and<br>blue<br>and ambient light all stimulated growth<br>so we were able to show for the first<br>time that<br>proteoradopsin not only was it present<br>in sea ice bacteria<br>but that it was actually working under<br>and in 2019<br>we decided that working with cultures<br>and tubes was not really relevant<br>to the real environment<br>so we covered large areas of ice<br>with different colored plastics<br>and it was pretty much a preliminary<br>experiment<br>getting ready and hoping for a marsden<br>fund<br>which we have currently waiting on the<br>outcomes<br>anybody in the audience on the panel i'd<br>just like to do a last-minute bit of<br>encouragement to you<br>so we haven't got any results from that<br>so that's what those panels look like<br>from underneath<br>the ice these ones here are red and you<br>can see they're pretty much as dark<br>as underneath the tent so not much light<br>gets through the red panels there's the<br>blue ones<br>so leave the bacteria behind and have a<br>think<br>about the algae that i worked on<br>so how does sea ice algae respond to<br>environmental change<br>we wanted to ask questions about their<br>physiology what happens at the cellular<br>level<br>and then at a much larger scale what<br>what what is the biomass of this food<br>how much is<br>actually available how much<br>food is available for the animals<br>so this is an experiment that's devised<br>by andrew<br>so despite all of those mishaps earlier<br>on andrew and i are still working well<br>together<br>and this is a experiment that he devised<br>and he called it the snow garden<br>and the idea was we'd lay out five by<br>five meter plots<br>and try and duplicate possible future<br>climate scenarios so here we've covered<br>this five by five meter plot with about<br>30 centimeters of snow<br>and the idea there is that that's going<br>to reduce the amount of light getting<br>through the algae underneath<br>the other thing that we didn't realize<br>until we got down there is five by five<br>meters by one third of a meter<br>equals eight cubic meters of snow<br>that we had to shovel around or i should<br>say andrew and fraser did most of that<br>so we have a low light<br>plot here we've got three of those and<br>a highlight plot so we cleaned that<br>right away so there was no snow on the<br>surface there's three of those<br>and a third plot somewhere in the middle<br>so it's about a 10 centimeter covering<br>and that gave us different light levels<br>underneath the ice<br>we left them there for 10 days<br>and we thought some they'll just get<br>and after 10 days we drilled some<br>core samples pulled out the algae had a<br>look at what was underneath<br>and underneath the low light plots we<br>found<br>that they were dominated by this<br>particular diatom called nichia stellata<br>and this is what it looks like here<br>that's uh this stuff most of this brown<br>stuff on here<br>at the bottom of the ice nichia stellata<br>in low light but in highlight<br>we got berkeley adelieensis this one<br>here it's another diatom that forms<br>strands<br>so after our 10 days<br>we decided we'd shovel snow from the<br>highlight<br>up from the low light plot to the<br>highlight plot<br>we did it there we did it that one went<br>to there<br>this one went to there again another lot<br>of shoveling<br>and a lot of work we left these ones<br>behind come on come on up<br>so now this plot is going to have<br>changed from low light<br>to highlight this plot is going to<br>change from highlight<br>to low light so we did that one day the<br>next day we came back<br>drilled some holes collected some<br>samples and did the same thing again<br>and we found to our surprise that<br>the previous low light that became a<br>highlight plot<br>the species that was dominant now<br>after three days was berkeley<br>and in the highlight plot that's your<br>stellata<br>so within three days we could even see<br>changes within 24 hours<br>but more pronounced after three days so<br>quite a dramatic change<br>it shows just how dynamic this system is<br>that if snow comes and falls on sea ice<br>as well as that associated with that<br>change in species<br>we decided to do some work with micro<br>electrodes<br>so we had a number of different<br>microelectrodes one measuring oxygen now<br>you all recall<br>earlier on in the talk i was talking<br>about oxygen being produced by<br>phytoplankton<br>so that's going to measure oxygen<br>production<br>phytoplankton growth but we also had a<br>number of probes that hadn't been used<br>before in sea ice<br>hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide<br>both of those sensors measure<br>if those compounds increase in<br>concentration<br>and this is work done by fraser kennedy<br>from<br>university of tasmania one of andrew's<br>students<br>so there's our ice core sample and this<br>water bath system here was made by<br>neville<br>neville hickerson from our department<br>here's our piece of ice here<br>and it's held down with some springs<br>holding it down<br>in the water in this little bath there's<br>some filtered sea water<br>this pink colour is due to ethylene<br>glycol which we use to keep everything<br>cold without freezing<br>solid into ice so<br>let's have a look at what we got with<br>that<br>if we didn't do anything this is the<br>plot we did nothing to<br>then the amount of oxygen produced<br>didn't change<br>but if we have a look at this blue line<br>here<br>moving from low light relatively normal<br>levels of oxygen production<br>we moved them to highlight we got a huge<br>increase in oxygen production the<br>highlight was stimulating photosynthesis<br>producing lots and lots of oxygen<br>and so we saw a large level<br>large increase there which dropped away<br>fairly quickly<br>now high levels of oxygen can be very<br>damaging for cells<br>it can induce the production of reactive<br>oxygen species and hydrogen peroxide is<br>one of those<br>so that indicates perhaps the cells are<br>going to be under stress but let's have<br>a look<br>at what happened with hydrogen peroxide<br>soon after 24 hours after our transition<br>to the time when we shovel that snow<br>from one place to another<br>those that have gone moved suddenly into<br>highlight<br>are extremely stressed hydrogen peroxide<br>very high 400 times higher than normal<br>and the cells manage to acclimate to<br>these new conditions<br>after 72 hours we got similar results<br>with nitric oxide i'm not going to show<br>so our snow garden experiment<br>showed rapid changes in species<br>composition that was quite a surprise<br>and the development of the appearance of<br>that strand forming bacteria<br>sea ice algae berkeley<br>indicates you know maybe changing light<br>preferences<br>have happened in that region over the<br>last 15 years 20 years ago 25 years ago<br>i don't recall seeing that species ever<br>significant physiological changes under<br>light stress<br>it's obvious as well the next step in<br>the process<br>would be to put these micro sensors<br>on a underwater robot an rov it's even<br>get a larger scale<br>view and<br>that's what we did in 2019<br>or should i say andrew and fraser<br>because i actually wasn't there<br>which is a bit disappointing because tv<br>one news caitlyn ruddick from tv one<br>visited the group last year<br>and some of you may have seen those<br>clips on tv news just a couple of weeks<br>ago<br>so i got in contact with kate and i<br>managed to get hold of those clips so<br>i'm going to show you those<br>and yep i'll leave it over to fraser to<br>tell you what's happening i like the<br>light just the right<br>level so some of them are going to be<br>really stressed out and we'll see that<br>on these chemical traces<br>using micro sensors which for the first<br>time are being taken underwater<br>you can give it a go my gosh no pressure<br>the date is still being analyzed but<br>already scientists are seeing species<br>compete for energy<br>under the different sheets there'll be<br>some winners there's be some losers<br>but unless you have a dense community of<br>algae<br>at the ice water interface larval krill<br>will struggle for a food resource<br>keeping a close eye on the smallest<br>so i've shown you these these views<br>underneath the ice you can see these<br>dense<br>and we do cutting of course we take<br>large number of coarse samples<br>and we could we don't know what it's<br>like underneath the ice we could be<br>drilling<br>through a piece here or<br>a piece over there or<br>somewhere here we might go through one<br>of these holes<br>and every time we get a different<br>estimate of the amount of biomass<br>so in order to get a decent<br>understanding of<br>of the level of biomass in this<br>particular location<br>we have to drill lots and lots of holes<br>and i can't even imagine how many holes<br>that has been probably thousands and<br>thousands over<br>the 30 years or so that would have been<br>down there<br>so this is what we normally do oh this<br>is simon davey by the way where's simon<br>there somewhere and alice this is your<br>dad<br>that's him now normally i would make<br>jokes about how<br>much taller i am than simon but this is<br>a<br>so normally we drill through the ice<br>we get our core sample cutted up and so<br>forth but<br>if we want to get onto a broader scale<br>how much<br>how much is present over here<br>or over there or in a different position<br>we can only sample on a small scale<br>using this system<br>so i showed you this image before<br>showing phytoplankton along<br>the coast of new zealand out on the<br>chatham rise over here you can see these<br>blooms of algae<br>phytoplankton growing in open water<br>and that can be done with a satellite<br>camera<br>our eyes digital cameras your cell phone<br>sees three colors red blue and green and<br>interpolate you interpolate with your<br>brain<br>the different colours a hyperspectral<br>camera<br>is a different sort of camera that<br>instead of<br>just looking at three colours looks at<br>lots of them<br>100 200 different colors different<br>wavelengths of light<br>and you can do a process called<br>and if you put that on a satellite<br>and collect the light that reflects back<br>off the surface of the ocean<br>then you can compare a region<br>one region with another if there's<br>chlorophyll present<br>say here for example then some of those<br>colours are going to be missing because<br>the phytoplankton cells have absorbed<br>them<br>so you can use that missing light to<br>work out<br>how much chlorophyll is present you can<br>do this with hyperspectral imaging<br>and the amount of chlorophyll that's<br>present is directly related to how much<br>phytoplankton is there<br>and if you do that you get an image<br>something like this<br>red reflects large amounts<br>of chlorophyll and lots of phytoplankton<br>in the water<br>you can probably expect there's going to<br>be some zooplankton<br>eating it and then there's probably<br>going to be fish<br>and lots of other organisms taking<br>advantage of this highly productive zone<br>and you can see regions of high<br>productivity<br>and relatively low productivity in<br>different parts of<br>the country so wouldn't it be great<br>if we could use the satellite to look<br>down<br>but unfortunately satellites can't see<br>through sea ice<br>it's a bit of a shame fortunately<br>andrew's got some friends over at<br>university of tasmania<br>who have hyperspectral imaging systems<br>about a hundred thousand dollars so we<br>haven't got one<br>but vanessa does and she bought<br>her hyperspectral camera imaging system<br>down<br>to antarctica in 2018 2019<br>and arranged a system where it<br>it's on a on a frame a bit like<br>star wars tie fighter with<br>some skis here so we put some floatation<br>uh<br>device underneath the skis to hold<br>everything buoyant and up underneath the<br>ice<br>so the idea is that that would go<br>underneath the ice<br>and slide along and look up using the<br>hyperspectral camera<br>and we'll be able to get some images of<br>chlorophyll distribution over a much<br>so this is a second clip from the news<br>items on tv news<br>a couple of weeks ago these algal messes<br>help sustain the southern ecosystem<br>but they're hard to quantify so<br>traditionally survey and mapping of the<br>earth's surface is conducted from<br>from satellites from aerial surveys but<br>one of the challenges of working with<br>sea ice<br>is that none of these traditional<br>well this is a classic way of accessing<br>algae under the ice here in antarctica<br>but one core is a fraction of the<br>some 20 million square kilometers of sea<br>ice around us<br>but this season the scientists here are<br>trying new technologies<br>to make the sampling area much larger<br>it's the first time such a system has<br>been used in polar waters<br>so the scientists are writing the<br>handbook as they go<br>so the engineering challenge was being<br>able to get this hyperspectral payload<br>which creates a single line of pixels<br>that scans underneath the eyes<br>to be able to be moved they built an<br>underwater cable car<br>it's got a pulley system running a 30<br>meter cable along the ice<br>the camera is then fixed to a pair of<br>skis and flipped over to face the algae<br>this is one of the swords that the<br>system has come these swots are highly<br>dense with information<br>ice core samples are still taken and are<br>an important tool<br>but pixel by pixel they're now building<br>a map<br>to a golden world below kaiden ruddock<br>so this is the sort of result that<br>we were aiming to get so very pleased<br>with this this is a 20 meter transect<br>underneath the ice and it's about<br>0.7.8 of a meter wide<br>and here's more or less a visual image<br>showing<br>different densities of sea ice algae on<br>the underside of the ice<br>but this is the result of the<br>hyperspectral<br>imaging system where we're now able to<br>say<br>the chlorophyll concentration right here<br>is 40 milligrams per square meter<br>over here about 15<br>and there may be close to zero we've got<br>a map of chlorophyll distribution on the<br>underside<br>of the sea ice so<br>we're hoping that this system can be<br>used on a larger scale there's lots of<br>technical difficulties<br>in getting it to work one of the most<br>important of which is there's not much<br>light underneath there<br>and you need to collect a lot of light<br>in order<br>to create each enough information in<br>each pixel<br>so it's hard work a lot of computing<br>power<br>but we're hopeful that it might work for<br>so we think sea ice<br>microbes are the canary and the golem<br>in the coal mine a window into the<br>future<br>thinking about warming climates we might<br>expect<br>thinner ice maybe some more rain both of<br>those<br>likely to enhance light penetration<br>melting of the ice the short term<br>perhaps<br>increased algal growth underneath the<br>ice increase productivity more food<br>on the other hand if there's more snow<br>it will decrease<br>the amount of light that gets through<br>the sea ice<br>or decrease algal growth we may change<br>the species composition it may not be as<br>palatable to<br>the organisms that want to eat it<br>there's more open water<br>and less sea ice we'll get more<br>phytoplankton growth in the open water<br>but the krill juvenile krill rely on sea<br>ice algae as a barn for them over winter<br>so i thought i'd finish off so i got a<br>request from simon davies daughter<br>alice that she had to she wasn't coming<br>unless there's going to be some pictures<br>of penguins so<br>penguins here you are alice penguins<br>visited our camp in 2018 he's an emperor<br>penguins<br>and there is a rule when you're<br>us approaching wildlife and antarctica<br>don't get closer than 10 meters<br>but if you sit still camera at the ready<br>if they come up to you that's fine so<br>they certainly did so this is part of<br>our camp here<br>so yeah very lucky to be able to see<br>those<br>this is uh waddell seal and pup<br>um one on the left is is in a delhi<br>penguin<br>and that's andrew there uh quite a bit<br>younger andrew<br>at this stage andrew was going through<br>his maverick stage<br>so he fancied he was a a pilot and top<br>gun<br>so that's that's the reason for the<br>glasses<br>and many of you know that i coach<br>gymnastics<br>in my spare time and so it's not a bad<br>handstand<br>yeah not too bad eh legs together type<br>though<br>this is captain scott's hut so our field<br>camp is normally out over here<br>this is where we do our work this is the<br>hut historic heart that captain scott<br>used before he left on his fateful trip<br>to the south pole<br>that photo taken about midnight so<br>so i draw the lecture to a close<br>thanks particularly to the two andrews<br>and vanessa<br>all of these students lots of colleagues<br>from<br>new zealand and overseas that have<br>joined me down in antarctica<br>and i think now is probably a good time<br>to think about some drinks and<br>so<br>my name is professor essan mesbahe i'm<br>the<br>pro vice chancellor of the wellington<br>faculties of science<br>engineering architecture and design<br>innovation and<br>it's my great pleasure to give you give<br>the vote of thanks to professor ken ryan<br>shortly we will be serving refreshments<br>in the common room outside<br>but first i would like to highlight<br>three elements<br>from professor ryan's lecture this<br>evening<br>that i think exemplify the character<br>and values of our leading scholars here<br>but i have to go away from what i've<br>written here in my previous research<br>quite amazingly i was chasing<br>zooplankton phytoplankton and bacteria<br>to kill them<br>because when the ships go to different<br>parts of the world they carry<br>these bacteria which belong to a<br>different geographical position<br>and when they discharge them somewhere<br>else they become non-indigenous<br>species and they cause a lot of damage<br>so<br>having an insight into the life is<br>fantastic because<br>we finally failed we couldn't kill all<br>of them so it was still a challenge for<br>marine industry to be able to deal with<br>the<br>bananas water management<br>however the first and as i have been<br>here for<br>just 202 days i perhaps shouldn't<br>still be surprised by this but i<br>very much am the first is that my<br>colleagues here in the wellington<br>faculty of science<br>often seem to blur the line<br>between scientists and intrepid<br>explorer when they say antarctic<br>research<br>they really mean it they mean<br>spending weeks and weeks in one of the<br>harshest<br>and most inhospitable environments on<br>earth<br>and everyone seems very relaxed and<br>casual about this<br>and i think we very much noticed that<br>tonight<br>they appear to be as comfortable<br>drilling holes<br>in the antarctic ice sheet as they are<br>in the lab<br>this reminds me of the movie ice age i'm<br>just looking at<br>the little gear lot there that how many<br>of these ice holes are<br>created it made a lot of changes around<br>the world<br>and we noticed it in that cartoon<br>this is something that continues to<br>impress me and i have huge respect for<br>people like professor ryan<br>for their commitment and grit when it<br>comes to complex<br>larger scale field research the second<br>is<br>the emphasis on community both outside<br>and within the institution and in<br>particular having such a welcoming<br>and inclusive attitude towards<br>students i think it's very clear that<br>professor ryan<br>is an incredibly dedicated teacher and<br>supervisor<br>for him it doesn't seem to just be about<br>imparting knowledge onto students<br>rather he seems to give them the<br>opportunity to be part of<br>groundbreaking research and to<br>contribute and be<br>part of the team and i think the andrew<br>is a clear example of that<br>i imagine that being a student of<br>professor ryan has been a life-changing<br>experience<br>for many young people and thirdly<br>i am impressed by the breadth and<br>application of professor ryan's work<br>and tonight's lecture is a perfect<br>example of that<br>in covering 30 years of research he has<br>gone from the microscopic to the global<br>he has taken us from the bleakness of<br>the southern ocean<br>to the rich color and complexity of<br>microbial life<br>under the ice sheet and use this to<br>offer<br>a window into the future<br>this is an imaginative and impactful<br>approach<br>to science and to research and it is<br>exactly<br>what we need as we navigate the rocky<br>waters<br>of the global climate emergency we now<br>face<br>so professor ryan thank you very much<br>for your fantastic lecture<br>this evening and my warmest<br>congratulations on your well-deserved<br>promotion to professor thank you</p></main><footer
