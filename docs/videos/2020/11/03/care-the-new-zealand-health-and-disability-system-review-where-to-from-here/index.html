think<br>we'll start now i hate to disrupt<br>um the conversations and conviviality<br>it's good to see everyone has such a lot<br>to talk about<br>um but i'd like to welcome everyone to<br>this seminar uh welcome to the people<br>who are on zoom we can't see them but<br>hopefully they can hear us<br>and uh welcome to our department um<br>members and our visitors for those who<br>don't know me<br>my name is chris j i'm an associate<br>professor and medical anthropologist in<br>the department of general practice and<br>rural health<br>and i'm also the director of the care<br>research theme and i just want to say a<br>little bit about care because<br>we're being hosted by the department of<br>general practice and rural health but<br>this is a care seminar and here is the<br>collaboration for aging research<br>excellence<br>we have a network of some 220 members i<br>think<br>and we've been in existence for about<br>six years<br>i believe so um we<br>are committed to to exploring and<br>conducting research<br>and issues of older people health equity<br>next year we'll be trying to apply for<br>centre funding and continuing the good<br>work that<br>care does we do have some some leaflets<br>and pens<br>on the sets on the back row so help<br>yourself to those<br>before you go also just a note on that<br>is that we are recording the<br>presentation today and that will be<br>available on the care<br>website which is if you want the<br>presentation it's another reason to go<br>to the care research<br>theme website and you'll find our<br>newsletters and a lot more about<br>us there we always welcome new members<br>so<br>uh if you go to the care website to get<br>the recording you'll also be able to<br>um email us and say please join us up to<br>your<br>list so if you're not already a member<br>we would welcome<br>new members so just a couple of notes<br>um the zoom attendees uh<br>if you could post your questions to the<br>chat and<br>we have a care member meredith<br>who is standing by to read those<br>questions out we'll make space for<br>questions<br>both during peter's presentation he's<br>happy to take points of clarification<br>and on zoom if you could put them on the<br>chat and meredith<br>could speak to those and at the end<br>we'll<br>um we'll meredith will read the<br>questions on the chat that arise at<br>the end out we're hoping to have a bit<br>of time for questions<br>at the end so um<br>so it is my great pleasure to introduce<br>peter he's currently a professor of<br>public health at the<br>kohata center for hilra maori here at<br>the otago medical school<br>and peter has made i don't really need<br>to introduce peter<br>to us because we know him very well he's<br>made an enormous contribution too<br>and had a tremendous influence on<br>healthcare in new zealand as a<br>researcher an educator and a leader<br>he promotes social justice and health<br>equity<br>his contributions in the field were<br>recognized when he was made a companion<br>of the new zealand order of merit a<br>couple of years ago<br>and he was a panel member for the new<br>zealand health and disability system<br>review which was um led by heather<br>simpson<br>and we were very grateful to peter when<br>we invited him to come along and talk to<br>that<br>uh to that report um he very generously<br>agreed to come and present the key<br>messages and<br>also what the implications are where to<br>from here<br>so i will hand over to peter now and<br>thank you very much thank you very much<br>chris<br>and greetings to uh to the zoom<br>attendees<br>i i've got this little um reminder flag<br>in my mind<br>saying stand here so that you can see me<br>and and if i do start wandering around<br>which i generally do do<br>please can you reign me in and i'll come<br>back to my home<br>spot uh kia ora everyone it's a real<br>pleasure to be here<br>thank you for the invitation thank you<br>to care and thank you<br>to the department for hosting this<br>walk through some material about the<br>review of the health system<br>and then together speculate about what<br>the<br>future looks like this is very much a<br>tale of two halves<br>and the second half is yet to be told<br>and my insights and prognostications<br>will be no more accurate than yours or<br>anybody else's i think<br>all right<br>i'm going to start with some<br>acknowledgements to colleagues<br>who've been part of this<br>firstly i would like to acknowledge the<br>very large number of groups<br>organizations and individuals who<br>submitted<br>uh their views to the review over a two<br>year period so thank you to them<br>thank you to my panel colleagues in the<br>in the photograph<br>on the bottom left there heather simpson<br>who chaired the panel is<br>second from the right at the back<br>standing next to me<br>and the other panel members are all<br>there as well<br>and uh i can talk about them if<br>anybody's curious to know who<br>they are or what their backgrounds are<br>but i'll move on from that uh<br>now at this point the maori expert<br>advisory group not pictured<br>also had a critical role to play in this<br>whole process<br>chair chaired by sharon shea who is<br>currently the interim board of<br>chair of the bear plenty district health<br>board<br>and also a group of very illustrious<br>people<br>and they had a big role to play in the<br>also the secretariat was up to about 20<br>people<br>very very accomplished<br>hard-working and skilled group of people<br>as well<br>so this really was a major collective<br>effort<br>so just some disclaimers from me uh<br>i'm only presenting a few key points<br>from the review process and the<br>recommendations of the final report<br>all the interpretive comments represent<br>my own personal opinion i'm not<br>seeking to unless i explicitly specify<br>to the<br>country i'm only representing my views<br>i'm not seeking to<br>represent the views of others and also<br>and this comes back to my comment about<br>the implementation phase<br>i'm not involved with that at all and<br>that's where we get into<br>speculation about the future we do have<br>a few data points on the map now<br>but still it's uh it will unfold as time<br>uh to the zoom attendees and everyone<br>else here i'm really happy to take<br>questions or points of clarification as<br>we move through this material<br>and then there will be plenty of time<br>for discussion i'll only talk for<br>about half the time that we have and the<br>right i'm gonna talk about the terms of<br>reference for the review<br>that's important uh<br>i'll touch on some of the key<br>recommendations not all of them because<br>there's a lot and i<br>we've only got time to refer to a few of<br>them<br>and then we'll start thinking about what<br>the implications are for<br>policy development here on<br>uh the resource documents<br>well the the the the work of the panel<br>and the secretariat resulted in two<br>documents<br>this is the one there this is the<br>interim report<br>these are downloadable uh<br>that is the best textbook on the new<br>zealand health system<br>at the moment in my view it will of<br>course become out of date<br>fairly quickly but as a point in time<br>reference document<br>there's never been anything quite like<br>it so i recommend that from a<br>resource point of view or teaching point<br>of view it's<br>a very rich document and this is the<br>final report which looks very similar<br>less useful as a reference document<br>because it contains less background<br>information<br>but this document has all the<br>recommendations in it<br>and it's a useful document if you want<br>to<br>discern the direction of travel of the<br>panel's recommendations<br>there is also a summary some summary<br>documents relating to the two reports<br>too<br>all right let's move on to the terms of<br>reference<br>so david clarke has just been<br>re-elected to the electorate seat of<br>northern england<br>with a huge majority vice minister of<br>health<br>and he said repeatedly in public that<br>one of his motivations<br>uh when he took up the role of the<br>portfolio of minister of health was that<br>he<br>he thought it was time that the country<br>had to look at<br>health system and went back to first<br>principles and worked out if it was<br>achieving for us what we wish it to<br>achieve<br>and while there have been many<br>restructurings and partial reviews<br>over the last three or four decades<br>there's never been a comprehensive<br>end-to-end review of the health system<br>working from the point of view of first<br>principles so that<br>that was one of his key motivations to<br>take up the portfolio because he thought<br>that was a timely contribution<br>he placed equity right at the center of<br>the terms of reference<br>because that was a value which was<br>important to him and the government that<br>he was part of<br>and also sustainability he also wanted<br>the review panel to give an indication<br>of the pathway to implementation<br>so rather than just produce a big report<br>and just say go do it it was to our job<br>was also to<br>outline some of the steps and some of<br>the sequencing which would need to occur<br>in if our recommendations were to be<br>taken up and implemented by the<br>government<br>we will come to this at the end but just<br>to know we have a<br>new minister of health right now that's<br>chris hipkins<br>we do not know who when i say new that's<br>new post data clerk<br>we don't know who the minister of health<br>will be in when the government is<br>formed in about a fortnight the new<br>government<br>so that remains an open question it is<br>the job of that minister and of<br>cabinet in particular to pick up these<br>recommendations<br>and drive them to the extent they wish<br>okay so i'm going to turn now to the<br>recommendations<br>the interim report was published in<br>around august last year and<br>set the frame and the foundation<br>for the final report the interim report<br>gave a strong indication of a direction<br>of travel but it didn't specify<br>recommendations it was never intended to<br>the final report gives a strong<br>indication of a direction of travel<br>and it's the final report that i'm<br>referring to now in terms of these<br>recommendations<br>i'm picking out some themes here so<br>these are quite high level<br>i think comes through in the report<br>quite clearly<br>and others have reflected this back as<br>well are themes around accountability<br>now uh i was part of an oral<br>exam for a phd yesterday<br>it was a brilliant phd at a different<br>university<br>and the candidate one of the points i<br>questioned him about he said<br>the primary health care system is<br>designed around the principle of equity<br>and i suggested to him that the primary<br>healthcare system was not designed at<br>all and and we by and large have an<br>undesigned health system<br>let alone around the principles of<br>equity there are policy<br>statements and intentions<br>which focus on equity<br>but our system has grown like topsy<br>since the time<br>of the social security act in 1938 which<br>established a<br>currently modern system and just as a<br>reminder<br>was to the best of my knowledge the<br>first modern health system<br>at a national level in the world the<br>1938<br>social security act the archetype<br>beverage type system came along 10 years<br>later in 1948 in the uk post the second<br>world war<br>our system was set up post the great<br>depression of course<br>which was the moment in political time<br>where<br>acts were possible made possible by the<br>great depression<br>and just so after the second world war<br>in a country dominated by conservative<br>politics<br>a labor government was able to introduce<br>the<br>however uh sorry<br>yes question online could you please<br>clarify whom<br>equity applies to does it also include<br>pacifica<br>and other groups yeah thank you<br>in the terms of reference equity was<br>used<br>very broadly the panel interpreted the<br>socioeconomic equity maori<br>pacific disability and other groups<br>where<br>equity principles are particularly<br>important and imply<br>so very broadly does that answer your<br>question<br>so coming back to accountabilities and<br>functions<br>at the moment for example there are<br>confused accountabilities between<br>primary health organizations industry<br>health boards their terms of reference<br>actually overlap very considerably<br>and it's very hard to know where<br>responsibility is cheated home to<br>in our current system so that's the sort<br>of accountability clarity that the panel<br>for what would be important in our<br>system<br>and being clear about functions and<br>responsibility<br>another theme was this idea of having a<br>system at<br>all does new zealand have a health<br>system<br>question mark i think we all think of it<br>as having a health system<br>i am told and i haven't tested this that<br>in the national health service in the uk<br>you could walk down the street of any<br>town bump into a healthcare worker who<br>might be a receptionist or a dentist or<br>a<br>gp or a hospital radiologist or whatever<br>and you could say to any of those people<br>who do you work for and they say the nhs<br>that is the answer they give in new<br>zealand if you walk down the street and<br>bump into any health worker<br>who do you work for i work for<br>mornington health center or i work for<br>the southern dhp<br>or i work for uh community radiology or<br>whatever it might be<br>and for me that's a symbolic point<br>sorry i just wanted i want to slightly<br>challenge you<br>um either because i think if you ask a<br>gp they might say i work for<br>such a such health center and if you ask<br>a dentist they might<br>similarly uh you know they have a lot of<br>private<br>work as well so it's not completely<br>different from that<br>in that regard right<br>having worked in those systems would you<br>say that there's more of a sense of a<br>system there<br>yeah i think that's about that point i<br>think it is a point i think it is a<br>symbolic<br>unity in the british health system that<br>is happening in this country<br>and that's the point i'm trying to<br>we don't have shared values in in a<br>particularly deliberate way i think we<br>do have a lot of shared values<br>but they're not constructed at a systems<br>level in the way that they<br>probably are in the nhs<br>um one of the things that the panel<br>recommended was a charter<br>for the new zealand health system which<br>has not been formulated yet but it would<br>contain a set of values<br>and common objectives that hopefully<br>nearly everyone could sign up to<br>very strongly to try and unify a<br>very disparate and complex system one of<br>the themes that i haven't<br>got on here is the sheer complexity<br>and irrationality of our system<br>i mean no one in this room i will posit<br>and prove me wrong please<br>or out there in zoom land can you tell<br>me why<br>uh for example podiatrists are<br>distributed the way they are<br>and why you pay for one here and not for<br>one there<br>and yet we would all agree that podiatry<br>is a critical component of<br>diabetes care and it's completely<br>hazardous as far as i can tell how it's<br>organized and that observation goes for<br>so many elements of healthcare provision<br>within our system<br>uh the mere fact that we have carved off<br>that part of the body and put it over<br>there<br>and charge very large amounts of money<br>to many many people can't afford it<br>particularly adults and and<br>decade after decades ignore that it's<br>truly weird i find that quite surreal<br>but there's numerous examples like that<br>right so that's the charter and shared<br>values uh<br>and to some extent shared culture<br>because it's so much about culture isn't<br>it<br>a very strong emphasis on equity<br>comes through the report whether or not<br>you think we've done enough about it<br>there's another question<br>but certainly there's an emphasis on it<br>and and strongly on hold of maori and<br>i'll come back to that in a moment<br>uh contentiously<br>and i'll explain my use of that word uh<br>population health has been put in as a<br>driver of the system<br>at all levels the contention comes in<br>because a number of my public health<br>colleagues don't think it's strongly<br>enough in there<br>from an institutional design point of<br>view or the architecture of our system<br>it's not contention about that being a<br>set of organizing principles it's<br>contention about how we've<br>tried to operationalize that and<br>community engagement is a theme<br>possibly less strongly expressed but it<br>is in there and it<br>sticks out to me as a theme so i'm<br>moving on from some of those themes i'm<br>now going to dive into some of the more<br>specific<br>details starting with system<br>architecture<br>according to the review panel and of<br>course whether or not<br>this is implemented along these lines<br>remains to be seen<br>so this is the world as<br>the report recommends minister of health<br>ministry of health there now these two<br>are new organizations at the center of<br>the system<br>one of them is called uh has a<br>uh a holding name of the maori health<br>authority<br>and i'll come back to that in a minute<br>and the other one has a holding name of<br>health new zealand health new zealand<br>having overall responsibility for the<br>service delivery<br>arm of our health system so it's like<br>the nhs<br>executive as it were so<br>the panel is of the view that that would<br>have a different culture from the<br>ministry of health<br>a different set of skills different set<br>of embassies<br>its board would be made up of fifty<br>percent maori fifty percent non-maori<br>and uh a lot of those people would be<br>chairs of district health boards<br>who collectively take responsible<br>responsibility for the whole system<br>not just a bit of it so there's a strong<br>emphasis on whole of system performance<br>here<br>was the point of some contention and<br>there were two sets of views expressed<br>in the report<br>the main view which i don't agree with<br>which is that it has an<br>advisory and uh monitoring function and<br>works in partnership with other<br>components in the system<br>so much along the lines of the maori<br>health directorate and the ministry of<br>health right now<br>the other view which i do support and<br>the number of us did<br>was that maori health authority would<br>have a major commissioning role<br>as well as those other things i<br>mentioned and that means it would have a<br>very meaningful budget<br>and it would have the capacity<br>to direct resource and and strongly<br>influence<br>the health system if we've got time we<br>can come back to that point<br>so that's overall systems architecture<br>at the center<br>and down here we have community based<br>organizations district health boards are<br>the<br>teal colored dots and<br>other regional entities and of course<br>primary healthcare and all those other<br>community-based<br>organizations which we termed tier one<br>in the report as a grouping of<br>uh primary community-based<br>peter question here online uh just<br>thinking about that systems architecture<br>um was he and you may be coming to this<br>later but<br>was there a much discussion or thought<br>around<br>um robust data collection systems across<br>this<br>yes i'm not touching on that in the<br>slides but there's a whole chapter on<br>that and in fact we<br>we expressed our views with considerable<br>urgency on that point<br>around<br>the information infrastructure for our<br>whole system<br>so huge emphasis on that and it's not<br>otherwise mentioned in these slides but<br>just to say yes<br>and we spoke a lot about that in the<br>report<br>and and we believe all of us believe<br>this was i think unanimous<br>there needs to be considerable<br>investment from now on<br>in getting our information systems to to<br>a more fit for purpose<br>state peter just a question of the way<br>that this is envisaged in terms of the<br>commissioning responsibility<br>it did i'm assuming it sits with the can<br>you just describe<br>in two versions of the my health<br>authority where commissioning would sit<br>so commissioning the key commissioning<br>role<br>in this schematic sits with the dhb<br>still<br>that with clearer responsibility and<br>accountabilities including all of<br>what we call tier 1 will otherwise call<br>primal health care<br>and community-based care with quite a<br>lot of commissioning oversight and<br>direct involvement for national<br>commissioning<br>from health new zealand so some boundary<br>in there yet to be determined<br>so some tertiary services for example<br>would be commissioned at a national<br>level<br>some services which where it makes sense<br>to commission<br>at a national level will sit with help<br>new zealand otherwise with<br>district health boards the maori health<br>authority<br>with the alternative view as it's called<br>would act as a commissioning agency<br>working in partnership with<br>the other commissioning agencies in a<br>coherent<br>joined up way which a number of us feel<br>is achievable<br>and which is a very positive disrupter<br>which could change the<br>trajectory of the new zealand health<br>system others including the chair<br>for that would not be possible<br>that was the difference of you does that<br>answer your question<br>right i've got a whole lot of detail<br>here which i'm going to<br>flick past so just look at the slides<br>and just see what the headings say so<br>population health we've touched on<br>holden maori<br>we've touched on and the alternative<br>view<br>which is the maori health agency's<br>commissioning role we have touched on as<br>well<br>peter another online online question<br>sorry so<br>um thinking about this sort of new<br>potential new vision here<br>most dhbs have not proved able to<br>embrace primary<br>care needs nor shift those resources<br>could you talk us through how you think<br>this new proposal might do this<br>differently better yeah<br>it's a great question and in fact that<br>question could be applied with<br>with a minimal rewording to so many<br>components of the health system<br>and i just want to draw a very clear<br>distinction now between<br>behavior and culture and structures<br>so that is a very good question and it<br>by<br>and large to my mind doesn't invite a<br>structural<br>response structures will not determine<br>so we're trying to change behavior<br>to<br>enable industrial ports to be really<br>effective commissioning agencies<br>for tier one community-based services<br>including<br>all of primary healthcare right<br>so that will be done through<br>accountability structures<br>culture support enhancement<br>expectations etc those sorts of<br>mechanisms<br>rather than through structural<br>mechanisms now i'm not being realistic<br>about structure here<br>and the very clear accountability of<br>health new zealand<br>remember one of those central agencies<br>for the effect of commissioning<br>community-based services<br>and its collective responsibility for<br>the whole of the country<br>we hope will encourage the sorts of<br>behavior and culture that<br>are necessary for there to be effective<br>commissioning at<br>the level of the community does that go<br>some way<br>question sorry what you've just said<br>does that imply a different model of<br>funding<br>for general practice in particular<br>i'll come to that now i'm only going to<br>flip over a few things we'll run out of<br>time<br>so uh these are tier one recommendations<br>so tier one remember is community based<br>very very loose boundaries here and<br>we're not trying to overly define those<br>boundaries<br>dhps have authority there is a locality<br>approach and i'll define that in a<br>little bit more detail on the next slide<br>there is ring fence funding because the<br>trend<br>data over time suggests that dhbs<br>have responded to the immense pressures<br>holding community based funding level<br>and preferentially funding provider<br>armed services within dhbs<br>and the evidence for that is in the<br>reports<br>uh equity and prevention being a<br>priority that's about behavior and<br>culture<br>provider networks and i'll specify<br>cultural safety and kappa maori services<br>to be provided<br>everywhere as an expectation for all<br>localities<br>phos are not mandatory in the new system<br>so dhbs may choose to have other<br>contracting arrangements<br>and ph so service agreements are not<br>mandatory so that's actually quite a<br>marked<br>change that the panel was recommended<br>these provider networks which are<br>specified in just a moment<br>are a network group of community based<br>services<br>which will be required to work together<br>using joined up i.t systems<br>so it may consist of a local or a health<br>provider<br>nothing changes about that they stay<br>being who they are and where they are<br>but they're formed part of a formal<br>network just so general practices<br>just so uh well child care diso pharmacy<br>just so<br>am i missing out here all the other<br>obvious ones<br>that just shows you what i've just said<br>now don't worry about reading this<br>that's the list<br>of uh locality-based services which will<br>be formally networked<br>and it includes some of those services<br>i've just<br>um identified<br>plus some others including outreach and<br>palliative care<br>and population-based health services and<br>and one can add in other services it<br>does not include<br>for reasons which we could discuss but i<br>believe it should be in there but that<br>so there will be more flexibility less<br>prescription<br>that's to take out from this slide the<br>dhbs will be able to relate<br>from a funding point of view commission<br>services<br>in a more in a wider variety of ways<br>which<br>will be tailored to the specific needs<br>of their local population and the<br>configuration of services that they're<br>funding<br>and i've listed some of the funding<br>the panel did specify that there should<br>be fair pay regardless of locality<br>and has implied<br>that nurses doctors and other<br>varieties of healthcare professional can<br>expect more consistency nationally in<br>terms of remuneration<br>both in terms of relativities within<br>primary care but relativities between<br>primary care and secondary care<br>i'm running out of time in the future<br>here we get into speculation so<br>obviously<br>we have a<br>labor-led government for the next three<br>years<br>with a very strong electoral mandate<br>to get on with their program of work and<br>this was an existing program of work<br>so i'm assuming the government will read<br>into this that they have a green light<br>on<br>as many of those recommendations as they<br>an implementation committee has been set<br>up<br>chaired by or an implementation group<br>with stephen mckernan at the head of<br>that<br>uh stephen mckernan was director general<br>of health<br>in the ministry of health during the<br>latter part of the<br>uh the first decade of this millennium<br>uh so he's familiar with the territory<br>uh and since then he's been working for<br>in consultancies and he's working for<br>i think his accountabilities go through<br>to dpmc<br>as opposed to anywhere else so that the<br>prime minister will have direct<br>hands-on involvement with any<br>restructuring what might which might<br>eventuate<br>and that last point there is that<br>my advice is uh that we all of us feel<br>empowered to have<br>input and provide views into the process<br>of change if there is a process of<br>change and i expect there will be<br>that none of this is particularly set in<br>concrete yet so we can all have<br>influence where we feel that's important<br>that's a personal view that i hold<br>others may hold a different view but i<br>think it's really important<br>that as we start retesting some of the<br>ideas<br>all the stakeholders and groups feel<br>empowered to express views on that<br>so that that is the end of my slides uh<br>and that was a huge amount of<br>information in a very short period of<br>time<br>but it's just scraping the surface of<br>what's in<br>the two reports and now let's just have<br>a discussion<br>uh on any of the four going<br>so how do you want to do this peter<br>because we've got some questions already<br>from<br>can i just hand that the equity<br>responsibility over to you<br>um i was just wanting to know uh if you<br>looked<br>uh further afield than new zealand force<br>and it looks like he looked at the nhs<br>is the nhs a kind of a gold standard and<br>did you look anywhere else<br>qualified no and yes so um<br>is the nhs the gold standard in some<br>respects yes<br>and certainly a huge amount of learning<br>can be gained from the nhs<br>um whether or not it's the gold standard<br>is<br>up for debate and we looked at many<br>countries and drawn evidence from many<br>places and<br>heather simpson and the head of the<br>secretariat<br>when uh and shannon on the second tour<br>went on two tours together<br>around various countries including<br>looking at the nuka model<br>in north america of indigenous ownership<br>and provision<br>thank you there's a question behind you<br>peter thanks very much for that really<br>really informative<br>um my question centers around<br>is it's called the health system and<br>it's nice to see<br>you and getting a system actually it<br>seems to be more of a disease<br>treatment system i just wondered whether<br>determinants of health were examined at<br>all<br>you know in this process so for example<br>the western world nutrition<br>poor nutrition now number one cause all<br>the problems that we're dealing with<br>physical inactivity is not very far<br>behind<br>that's a great question martin thank you<br>um yes it's a short answer<br>so and i skipped over this uh<br>when i said that population health is an<br>organizing principle<br>of the system it's a driver key driver<br>at every level at the center in each of<br>those central agencies<br>led by the ministry of health at the<br>district health board level<br>if there are new regional entities in<br>that level<br>and at the locality level<br>and that is exactly what i'm referring<br>to responsiveness to those<br>determinants of the drivers of health<br>status<br>one of the interesting debates<br>is centers on whether or not we should<br>have a separate ministry of<br>public health or equivalent by the<br>public health commission that we had in<br>for two or three years in the 1990s and<br>whether that benefits<br>from from a systems architecture point<br>of view the pros and cons of that can be<br>debated<br>at length but it's a very interesting<br>debate to be had<br>if we're thinking about the determinants<br>of health do we need a specialized<br>agency<br>or do we already have it in terms of the<br>ministry of health or what would need to<br>change in the ministry of health to make<br>it the organization that we should wish<br>it to be<br>and i could go on but yeah the short<br>answer is yes<br>can i just see if there's any questions<br>um meredith<br>yep so i've got a couple of questions<br>online and the first question is really<br>uh you talked about perhaps trying to<br>ensure there's sort of more<br>um funding equality in terms of<br>health professionals but this question<br>is about<br>whether there was any consideration<br>around uh<br>costs to uh<br>to to to people to patients in terms of<br>perhaps seeing their gp versus going to<br>see someone in the hospital you know<br>the community bears the costs in those<br>situations so<br>uh what what considerations have<br>occurred there<br>so there was because of the focus on<br>equity there was a great<br>deal of consideration of uh<br>out-of-pocket costs<br>and financial barriers to access to<br>various services and<br>there's some incredibly illuminating<br>figures and tables in the interim report<br>which show uh the the money flows out of<br>people's pockets into different parts of<br>the health system<br>and and pulled together in a way that i<br>don't think it's ever been pulled<br>together before<br>a lot of it you know some of it you<br>financial barriers to access is<br>obviously a key consideration<br>uh for many services including basic<br>things like spectacles<br>hearing aids oral health care et cetera<br>et cetera<br>and of course primary health care and<br>we did not seek to over specify<br>how government should fund deliberately<br>because<br>in the end that those decisions end up<br>being decisions of cabinet<br>we made our views very clear about<br>financial barriers to access<br>they should be minimized but we did not<br>levels of co-payment as it were i'm<br>disappointed that we<br>didn't take a stronger line on adult or<br>healthcare<br>but the the price tag attached that is<br>huge and<br>and that was a political call<br>essentially in the end<br>uh and one can debate that endlessly<br>i personally am in favor of much more<br>accessible<br>um peter great's talk thanks um so<br>sometimes<br>the existence of a system or an entity<br>within a system<br>is a reason to keep it just because it<br>exists<br>and to change from that would be<br>difficult or costly and so on<br>so there's a reason to be<br>sort of slightly conservative about<br>existing structures do you guys have a<br>discussion<br>i know i notice the dhbs are still there<br>and you know um things like that did you<br>have a discussion at all about<br>how conservative or radical you wanted<br>to be in approaching this<br>yeah endlessly it's a it's a wonderful<br>question<br>uh it's totally at the heart of all the<br>discussions<br>so some of our strongest critics and the<br>ones i<br>read most carefully uh and for example<br>tim convention who's the political<br>scientist at university of auckland<br>wonderful stuff read tim he has a um<br>two weekly or monthly column and uh new<br>zealand doctor<br>he he's referred to this a number of<br>times over the last number of months<br>uh he's a non-structuralist he thinks<br>we're<br>going to throw the bits up in the air<br>cause huge disruption<br>take productivity out of the system for<br>10 years<br>uh upset people's lives<br>do a whole lot of damage and in 10 years<br>we'll get bet<br>i'm paraphrasing history by the way uh<br>we'll get back to where we are and then<br>we can start talking about what really<br>matters which is culture<br>culture drives behavior<br>northern structures drive behavior<br>it's very interesting sitting on a panel<br>and hearing every single submitter bar<br>none that i can remember anyway saying<br>we've got too many dhbs<br>and not to think about that as a<br>potential problem<br>now we've heard more uh<br>i might be wrong about the bar none by<br>the way but the vast majority of yous<br>are problematized dhbs<br>too many too few<br>too much governance infrastructure in<br>new zealand health system one can debate<br>endlessly<br>in the end we made a call reduce the<br>number to eight to twelve<br>the exact configuration yet to be<br>determined<br>personally i'm more on the culture<br>behavior<br>positive leadership side than i am on<br>the structural reform side of this<br>that's where i stand on it but as i said<br>before i'm not realistic about<br>structures<br>i think the accountabilities issues and<br>the example i gave is a good one<br>phos and dhbs needs to be fixed that's<br>the structural problem that's about<br>terms of reference and who's sold<br>accountable for doing what<br>i completely agree with your point<br>there's some<br>built-in conservatism about structural<br>can we go to um can we go to another<br>another zoom question please<br>yes thank you um so this question is uh<br>really asking around<br>um at perhaps the focus or perhaps<br>lack of focus um in the report and it's<br>asking<br>why there wasn't so much attention on<br>perhaps workforce workforce distribution<br>um in in the report and and i i'm<br>yeah uh talks talks a lot more you know<br>you do<br>emphasize the importance of health<br>professionals but uh when the report<br>came out um<br>it's a little bit vague about actually<br>the numbers of health uh health care<br>professionals of certain professions and<br>yeah thank you another really these are<br>great questions so in the reports<br>both of them workforce is defined as a<br>key enabler and there is actually quite<br>a lot of<br>uh emphasis on workforce i think it's<br>quite<br>strong but we have not modeled<br>quantitatively future future workforce<br>requirements<br>my own view is that it's a mistake to<br>try and do that in this sort of report<br>quantitative modeling of<br>workforce requirements<br>has one thing going for it and that's<br>that's always wrong<br>and you know it's always wrong i i it's<br>still necessary to do that<br>but there are many ways of thinking<br>about the future needs of the workforce<br>based around scenarios expert input<br>advice<br>the deliberate contemplation of<br>different sorts of futures<br>which are equally if not more<br>informative so we did not get into a<br>workforce<br>modeling exercise we did make some quite<br>strong statements around<br>the distribution of the workforce and<br>the necessity for example<br>rural communities having adequate<br>serious provision<br>about to use the meta formula on society<br>that<br>sort of approach a workforce which is<br>appropriately diverse<br>to meet the needs of new zealand's<br>diverse communities we made statements<br>about<br>the health system modeling excellently<br>engagement with people with disabilities<br>by drawing<br>people with disabilities into the health<br>workforce deliberately in all parts of<br>the workforce<br>so there's a lot quite a lot on<br>workforce but not quantitative modelling<br>although that said for those who are<br>interested there's some incredibly<br>helpful and useful tables and um<br>figures related to the workforce as it<br>currently exists<br>we have basically a dual health system<br>in this country we've got the private<br>sector as well<br>what i'm not seeing in that is the<br>enrollment private sector<br>what is the role what components is that<br>quite a big component of the new zealand<br>health system<br>how does that interdigitate with what<br>we're talking about yeah<br>so the terms of reference put a boundary<br>around the<br>and excluded acc so acc was not in our<br>terms of reference<br>and exploit and excluded purely private<br>funding and provision<br>the terms of reference included the<br>boundaries between public funded and<br>publicly provided and<br>private so the boundaries were important<br>so within that of course<br>all of general practice is in because<br>uh there is a lot of reference to<br>private service provision<br>so for example optometry is nearly all<br>private<br>because it's so important that we as a<br>panel have not sought to<br>because of our terms of reference<br>restructure or make recommendations for<br>we go to another another zoom question<br>yep um this is this question back back<br>to equity again so um<br>you have been talking a little bit about<br>equity which is um<br>great this is seeking clarity on<br>when you're talking about equity are you<br>talking about equity of funding or<br>equity of outcome and if we're really<br>thinking about<br>outcome did you uh could you explain<br>where you got to in in measuring<br>outcomes<br>i.e how will we know that we've got<br>there<br>thank you uh so definitely equity of<br>outcomes as being the most meaningful<br>way of thinking about equity in this<br>context<br>uh again i come back to systems design<br>and answering that question<br>because i don't think there's any single<br>answer to that question and it's<br>context or demographic specific or<br>health conditions specific<br>in some instances so we if we have a<br>system which<br>has a driver population health<br>then that that sort of question gets<br>answered at the right level<br>or the right multiple levels as and when<br>it needs to be answered<br>so we have a population health or public<br>health informed<br>system which would have a huge emphasis<br>it must have been an interesting debate<br>with the expert advisory committee about<br>commissioning functions for um<br>i'm just interested in how that decision<br>was made was it a political intervention<br>okay so i'll repeat that question and<br>and correct me if i get<br>how was the decision made around the<br>final recommendations related to the<br>maori health authority in res<br>in respect of its commissioning function<br>was it a political intervention or was<br>it a<br>a chairs call was that your question<br>yeah<br>so just to say there was the maori<br>expert advisory group that we worked<br>closely with<br>there was one maori member of the panel<br>shelly campbell and there were a number<br>of panel members myself included<br>and there were maori members of the<br>secretariat<br>all of whom agreed with arguing at least<br>exploring<br>uh the commissioning function of the<br>so that was by far the majority actually<br>the people involved in the process the<br>chair of the panel made a call that this<br>was not<br>going to make its way into the final<br>main recommendations<br>instead there is on page 173 of the<br>final report<br>an alternative view that's what it's<br>called which describes<br>at a high level potential commissioning<br>functions of<br>a maori health authority necessarily at<br>a high level because<br>their option was never explored in any<br>depth by the secretariat and worked up<br>as a<br>implementable set of recommendations<br>does that answer your question thank you<br>okay another question<br>from the zoom merida yes thank you<br>how realistic is it to have three<br>agencies working in partnership<br>um is it possible that they might<br>actually have competing priorities and<br>therefore conflict<br>uh be conflicted and therefore perhaps<br>there would be lack of<br>cohesive progression or cohesive<br>direction<br>yeah great question how realistic is it<br>to have three central agencies working<br>i think the risks that were identified<br>in that question are real risks<br>very real risks and whether or not those<br>risks are manifest<br>to some extent in my view they will be<br>manifest<br>just by the nature of the way things<br>work<br>and the question then becomes the are<br>the net benefits of having three central<br>agencies<br>do they outweigh the disadvantages in<br>just following up on the fascinating<br>so the way it is the way the<br>recommendations go<br>yeah no look great question<br>uh so in my view they're still very much<br>open for exploration<br>in the future and a number of us are<br>still having<br>vigorous discussions about that within<br>varus for<br>and with various stakeholder groups it's<br>gained quite a lot of traction<br>out there in health sector land as an<br>idea<br>noting that it does need a lot more<br>working up around the detail<br>but no i think it's still there and i<br>would say that for all of the<br>the the the recommendations in the<br>report i think<br>they they all benefit from input and and<br>and extra thought and disagreement on<br>occasions too<br>okay can i just can we go to the zoo<br>panel for another question please<br>meredith yes thank you so<br>just thinking again about ideal system<br>architecture<br>how much of a challenge was it for acc<br>well there are two comments there one is<br>that our terms are reference were<br>very broad and very deep anyway so it<br>was some relief that it was out of scope<br>the second answer is the exact opposite<br>how can one review the health system<br>without including acc<br>and certainly the boundary between acc<br>and the rest of the health system is<br>is an incredibly important boundary and<br>if one is thinking about equity<br>of course the whole acc versus<br>everything else<br>debate looms very large doesn't it<br>does that answer the question so it's<br>it's uh i would say a matter for further<br>discussion in the future<br>and i think we might take um a last<br>question now from<br>jim okay um i just wanted to ask about<br>tier one services<br>because uh it seemed in your diagram<br>that<br>these networks these local networks<br>under the dhbs it looked as if they were<br>going to be<br>organized by service groups and<br>therefore<br>different from at least the um<br>aspiration<br>of phos which were designed to kind of<br>include various kinds of service groups<br>so that's that's one part of it the<br>i think that tier one providers would<br>would have a lot of<br>apprehensiveness about um being under<br>the planning and<br>on the first point the idea is<br>a network formerly network group of<br>providers<br>providing services to a defined patient<br>population<br>so not too different in principle from<br>phos but a wider network of service<br>providers<br>okay so like an extended pier yes yeah<br>okay yeah and it could be a ph<br>so dhbs would need to be resourced<br>uh and supported and encouraged<br>to do very very well as primary care<br>there would be almost uh<br>well there'd be quite general concern on<br>that point if we look at the status quo<br>but we're imagining a different future<br>sure thank you does that mean that gp's<br>salary the future they could be<br>but as they currently can be now<br>that doesn't predetermine that at all<br>right okay i think we'll i think we<br>could call a hold because i think that<br>we could easily<br>keep meeting here for another hour with<br>questions apologies apologies to people<br>who haven't had their questions answered<br>but um i'd really like to thank peter<br>for a most illuminating<br>talk that's been tremendously<br>educational<br>and a great discussion afterwards as<br>well<br>and thank you very much meredith for for<br>representing our zoom attendees team<br>thank you peter we've had um 67 people<br>so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
