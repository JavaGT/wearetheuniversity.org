programs recruitment and<br>partnerships manager<br>and so what that means is my role is to<br>help you work out what you might want to<br>study if you're looking at studying with<br>us<br>at hana tahangala waka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>so like i said in my title i work for<br>the professional programs<br>so that's a suite of professionally<br>focused postgraduate programs<br>at the wellington school of business and<br>government and today we're going to be<br>talking about<br>um our government programs in particular<br>so to give you a summary of how this<br>event is going to work<br>we're going to talk a little bit about<br>the university the faculty that these<br>programs belong to<br>and then we're getting going to get a<br>little bit more specific about the<br>individual programs<br>you've come to listen to this evening<br>and then some next steps<br>we do have a q a function so the<br>question and answer function that we'll<br>be running as i'm speaking this evening<br>i have a wonderful team behind the<br>scenes and you will be meeting some of<br>them a bit later on<br>and but please feel free to fire a<br>question through in that q a<br>please if you want it to be anonymous<br>don't put in any email addresses or<br>anything like that<br>um because if we do answer them we might<br>share them live if they're a good<br>question<br>so if you do have any questions after<br>afterwards or want to follow up<br>we will have our email address shared<br>and i'll also be sending you an email<br>directly after this webinar so please<br>send the q a through<br>we're hopefully leaving some time at the<br>end of this session where i will be<br>reading those questions live<br>and so we're having some common<br>questions or questions that we think are<br>good to be answered live<br>we might be saving them up for the end<br>if you don't get a response<br>as we go throughout but without further<br>ado like i said my name is poppy and<br>i'll be talking to you throughout this<br>webinar<br>and telling you a little bit more about<br>some of the programs we have here at the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government<br>now but first i do want to introduce the<br>university and if you have been to any<br>of my sessions before you will<br>um have heard some of this but we're at<br>tahereh victoria university of<br>wellington<br>so our programs they fall under the<br>wellington school of business<br>but you are part of the wider university<br>community<br>so i encourage you to find out a little<br>bit more about the university<br>and the things that you can get involved<br>with while you're a student with us<br>we're located in wellington the welling<br>capital city of new zealand<br>i know we have some international<br>students joining us this evening so that<br>very bottom<br>image on my screen that's a picture of<br>wellington on a very beautiful<br>uh sunny day and what you'll see is some<br>circles<br>and that represents where we are located<br>across the city<br>wellington is quite a compact city and<br>although it is the capital it's really<br>easy to get around really easy to move<br>around<br>and i will be showing you some pictures<br>later of where we are located<br>at in in the capital city but in on the<br>image at the bottom of my screen<br>you'll see where some of our other<br>campuses are so we do have campuses or<br>dedicated teaching spaces for specific<br>programs<br>and so i encourage you like i said to<br>have a wee look<br>at at the university itself and and<br>where it is situated<br>in in the city now here are some more<br>facts about wellington<br>if you don't know wellington um you can<br>have a look on the there's a link on the<br>screen there<br>and find out a little bit more about the<br>city but i was speaking to a student the<br>other day and i think the best way to<br>describe it<br>is the way they came up with and they<br>said wellington is full of really<br>engaged people<br>really engaged community wise really<br>engaged with the culture<br>and really engage with the politics so<br>it's a really amazing place to be<br>studying in particular the government<br>programs<br>or anything in in the wellington school<br>of business and government<br>now specifically the wellington school<br>of business and government that's the<br>faculty that our programs fall<br>underneath<br>and again hopefully you can see that<br>image on my screen<br>it's the zoomed in version of the image<br>i had before<br>for those of you who do know wellington<br>and and<br>know a little bit about the the city and<br>where things are located<br>you'll hopefully recognize that image on<br>my screen<br>it's the wellington waterfront and then<br>down in the middle<br>you should hopefully recognize a<br>building or two there and that's the<br>beehive<br>and the government buildings literally<br>just across the road from that is where<br>we are located so rutherford house and<br>government buildings our law school is<br>where um where<br>our programs are taught from and and so<br>you'll see we're really really close to<br>the beehive uh government where laws are<br>being made and changed where policy is<br>being formed<br>and we've got a really close connection<br>with lots of ministries<br>all around our campus so it's an amazing<br>place to study you just see all of these<br>things happening<br>um around you every day<br>there's another zoomed in image at the<br>very bottom there so a little bit more<br>hopefully you can see that so you<br>hopefully they recognize the beehive<br>that's the round building<br>and parliament right next door and then<br>the two buildings behind that that those<br>are the buildings i was referring to<br>before so our law school just behind<br>the beehive and then we have rutherford<br>house which is where we teach our<br>wellington school of business and<br>government programs<br>the campus if you are in wellington i<br>encourage you to check it out so here's<br>an image of the inside of rutherford<br>house<br>it is a really beautiful campus it's<br>very modern<br>um and the very last image on my screen<br>is our student study space<br>now at the professional programs we have<br>a variety of students<br>we have about 600 students across all of<br>the programs we do<br>offer and a wide range of ages our<br>youngest student is<br>is early 20s our oldest student is in<br>their 70s<br>so we do have that very diverse range<br>and what we find<br>is majority of our students about 80 of<br>them<br>they study while they're working so they<br>might be studying part-time<br>alongside full-time work<br>the dedicated student study space is a<br>fantastic resource for our students<br>it's a space that they can go and<br>dedicate time to their study individual<br>study<br>it's an area that they can study<br>together network with the other<br>professional program students<br>there's free printing there's breakout<br>rooms that they can use<br>and it's something we've had really good<br>feedback from from our students when<br>they're saying they've got a really busy<br>life<br>they've got their work or they might<br>have kids or family commitments<br>so having that space that they can<br>actually have some time out and dedicate<br>to them and their study<br>is really beneficial so if you are able<br>to come and check out the campus<br>i encourage you to come along it's a big<br>public space so you're welcome just come<br>in<br>and we can show you that professional<br>program space if it's something you want<br>now that was a very quick summary of the<br>university<br>and who we are as a faculty but i know<br>that you're here this evening to be<br>listening to<br>or finding out more about our government<br>programs that's our public policy<br>our master of public policy and the<br>certificate in the diploma that fall<br>underneath that<br>and our master of public management and<br>the certificate and diploma that fall<br>underneath that<br>so what i want to do before we go into<br>this the specifics<br>i want to introduce to you a very<br>important person in these programs<br>and to sorry dr amanda wolf so she is<br>the academic program leader<br>someone you will get to know very well<br>if you study these programs<br>so i'd like to invite her today just to<br>introduce herself<br>and talk to you a little bit and<br>introduce the programs that we'll be<br>discussing<br>so i'll invite amanda to come and speak<br>uh cure to everyone and thank you so<br>much poppy if poppy had continued her<br>tour around and<br>zoomed up eight levels in rutherford<br>house she would come to where we're<br>currently located<br>and where my office is as the academic<br>program leader<br>of the master of public policy and the<br>master of public management<br>so i just want to say a very few things<br>to orient you to what we're doing and<br>where we've come from<br>both programs have been going for<br>decades and they've been going<br>specifically for<br>professional learners just like you<br>people who have some experience<br>in government or in public service<br>related professions<br>be that ngo related maybe you've been a<br>press secretary for<br>a minister maybe you work in a<br>local government or regional government<br>context<br>or maybe you just have had interactions<br>with<br>uh policy as a representative of<br>the business community and so on<br>so as poppy has already mentioned<br>there's a huge diversity of students<br>and i think we have one of every kind in<br>our programs<br>it's a relatively large program with<br>students from all over the world<br>all over new zealand and across the age<br>range<br>and range of experiences um the program<br>itself is quite interdisciplinary<br>our lecturers and teachers come from<br>backgrounds<br>both within the public service of quite<br>a range of<br>experience and also educational<br>backgrounds<br>in economics political science sociology<br>philosophy<br>law and so on if you<br>choose to study in the master of public<br>policy or the master of public<br>management<br>whichever program it is you will<br>increase your skills<br>in your abilities to engage in the<br>policy process<br>be that as a policy advisor a policy<br>analyst<br>implementer of policies or a manager<br>senior manager of workforces and policy<br>implementation<br>you will hype you will enhance your<br>skills in<br>synthesizing and problem solving and<br>working with data<br>and thinking critically you will learn<br>and enhance how to communicate with<br>diverse groups of people diverse<br>stakeholders<br>take into account different perspectives<br>in our changing society<br>we keep our material incredibly current<br>it's a bit of a work job for us<br>teachers to always be updating our<br>material so it's always relevant<br>uh taking into account the issues of the<br>day and the issues of interest<br>to you you learn from each other and the<br>experiences that<br>students bring into the classroom and<br>those students i couldn't begin to<br>sort of picture the variety of what they<br>bring<br>into the classroom but i can<br>tell you that you will have an<br>opportunity to tailor your learning<br>to your particular interest and your<br>passion so you're never forced<br>to go in depth on something that you<br>care nothing about<br>when there's an opportunity to further<br>your skill development and your<br>knowledge<br>in an area of interest to you and that<br>culminates<br>in a capstone experience in<br>either degree where you integrate what<br>you've learned across your program<br>if you undertake a research project as a<br>requirement<br>in the mpp or as an elective you can go<br>in depth in a topic of interest to you<br>and recent students have looked at cyber<br>security<br>integrated food policy climate refugees<br>early childhood education waste<br>minimization<br>users experiences of e-government and it<br>goes on and on<br>and you're learning from people whose<br>breadth of research interest<br>is equally broad from child welfare and<br>well-being<br>to government procurement integrity and<br>government<br>sustainability public sector autonomy<br>policy success and it goes on and on<br>so our compass is quite broad our<br>experience is quite deep our enthusiasm<br>is enormous<br>and we really welcome you to find out<br>more about<br>what you would study and what you can<br>gain from<br>an mpp or an npm i'm going to shortly<br>hand back over to<br>poppy who will take you through all the<br>facts and details<br>but i'll be here and i'll contribute to<br>the live q a<br>at the end and also just to acknowledge<br>those people<br>who might be tuning in sometime later<br>and it's no longer evening and we're no<br>longer live<br>but i'm always available to answer your<br>questions<br>please do get in touch if i can help in<br>any way so<br>back over to you poppy thank you so much<br>thank you amanda so<br>like amanda said she is behind the<br>scenes answering those questions so<br>please do<br>send them through and while i'm going to<br>be talking about them individually and<br>so but what i wanted to do first before<br>we started talking about the master of<br>public policy and the master of public<br>management<br>i wanted to talk about some similarities<br>or or the background behind some of the<br>programs and i know amanda<br>did a wonderful job and i'm not sure<br>what i can add from that but<br>i wanted to talk a little bit about um<br>why we have these programs or<br>why they've been developed so the the<br>first thing i wanted to mention<br>is they have been designed to enhance<br>your career potential<br>it's like amanda said we've got a wealth<br>of background and diverse learners in<br>these particular programs<br>and they're typically bringing their<br>experience that they've had working in<br>the public sector or<br>wanting to grow that knowledge and so<br>what you're learning in your classes<br>is the academic non content that you<br>need you're looking at different<br>theories<br>and you're also looking at how you can<br>apply it and and really bringing that to<br>your your day-to-day work life<br>working in the public sector the second<br>thing it is around the applied learning<br>aspect of it<br>so you are it's uh sorry our programs<br>are professionally focused like i said<br>right at the beginning<br>so it means that you are really getting<br>to apply what you're learning in the<br>classroom and<br>to your assignments or to your everyday<br>and it's also the way<br>not only that the courses are taught but<br>how your classes are assessed<br>so in these two programs we don't have<br>exams<br>but instead you get uh assess through a<br>variety of different means<br>so you might be doing blogs uh through<br>your assessment<br>or presentations or working on a project<br>so it's really building up those skills<br>that you'll need when you're working in<br>the public sector and<br>and really how enhancing them and<br>fine-tuning<br>the other thing is like i said a lot of<br>our students they are working while they<br>study<br>and so our programs have been designed<br>in a way that allows you to do that<br>typically for a lot of our classes for<br>these two programs<br>is we teach them through block or<br>modular format<br>and what that means is that you come to<br>class<br>but you might come to class for a full<br>day or half a day<br>and then um you don't come again to<br>class for six weeks but<br>you're still doing some study in that<br>time and then after your six week period<br>you come back for another block day<br>again and further six weeks later you<br>come back for that final block day<br>so the class are designed in that way so<br>you're still getting that engagement<br>you're still<br>able to study with other students<br>whether that's online and engaging<br>through zoom discussions<br>or whether you're in class and you're<br>working with the groups of people who<br>are there and<br>in in that classroom environment so<br>you're still getting that contact time<br>and those classes<br>but you are able then to fit it around<br>your very busy day-to-day lives<br>typically when you are looking at study<br>and if you are looking at<br>studying alongside work what's important<br>is to think about how many hours per<br>week you might be needing to dedicate to<br>your study<br>so for each course a 15 point course<br>which the majority of ours are<br>we say you want to think about about 10<br>to 12 hours per week of study that's<br>what you'll be dedicating to it<br>so that includes your class time when<br>you have it but that's also you might be<br>working on your assignments or doing<br>readings or everything else that goes<br>alongside your study<br>we tend to say 10 to 12 hours per week<br>so if you are looking at working<br>typically our part-time students<br>they take one to two courses per<br>trimester<br>and full-time students up to three it is<br>recommended<br>i also encourage you to look at who will<br>be teaching you and amanda did<br>talk a little bit about that about all<br>the researchers and the academics who<br>are there<br>sharing their knowledge with you and and<br>the academics are heavily involved with<br>the public sector they're contributing<br>to the policy and<br>um and ministries so i definitely<br>encourage you just to see<br>who would you who you'll be studying<br>with and learning from<br>and also the connections that you might<br>be able to gain from<br>from that like i said just then there's<br>a lot of public sector connections so<br>being in wellington and the capital city<br>we do have<br>ministries surrounding the campus the<br>beehive and government just across the<br>road<br>even if you're not physically based in<br>wellington you still get to draw on the<br>connections that we have<br>being the capital city and your<br>academics also your<br>your future colleagues or staff outside<br>students that you're studying alongside<br>because of that work experience<br>requirement or a lot of our students do<br>come from the public sector<br>you're building an amazing network and<br>cohort of students<br>that you're really getting to grow that<br>that sector and<br>networks among the government programs<br>and and finally something that both<br>programs have in common<br>is the staircasing now i'm not sure if<br>you're aware of what this means so i do<br>want to explain<br>go into it a little bit and and what it<br>really means is we have<br>three qualifications that falls under<br>one header<br>so when we talk about public policy for<br>example you can study the master of<br>public policy<br>but there's also a certificate and a<br>diploma option<br>and what that means is if you want to<br>start off with the postgraduate<br>certificate<br>sorry postgraduate certificate you take<br>full courses<br>these are four courses from the masters<br>they're not taught at any different<br>level<br>and what it just means for the<br>certificate you're completing four<br>at that point you can finish if you<br>would like or<br>you can add on another four courses so<br>you complete<br>eight overall and you get this<br>postgraduate diploma<br>and finally if you add three or four<br>more courses depending on what program<br>you take<br>you can end up with the masters the<br>programs<br>are staircased so it means that we do<br>have students who work their way up<br>throughout the qualification<br>so if enrolling into a master's right<br>now feels like a little bit too much<br>you can definitely start off with the<br>certificate or the diploma<br>it also works the other way so if you<br>decide you would like to do the masters<br>but you need to have a break for some<br>reason or decide not to keep going<br>then you can look at finishing with the<br>certificate or diploma<br>now i will start talking specifically<br>about the individual programs so i'm<br>going to start off with the<br>master of public policy so everything or<br>a lot of things i'm talking about i i<br>will be calling it the master of public<br>policy but it does refer to the<br>typically the postgraduate certificate<br>and diploma as well<br>but in the public policy program this is<br>for people who are really<br>interested in in policy the way it<br>currently works how you can help<br>influence it<br>how you can feed into policy being made<br>and<br>learning more about the public sector<br>so there's some quick facts on the<br>screen and these ones<br>the top one there the duration that does<br>refer to the full masters<br>so the the minimum duration for the full<br>masters<br>is four trimesters or 16 months<br>now i will quickly just clarify what i<br>mean by trimesters because that's a word<br>that i am going to say a fair bit as i<br>go<br>throughout this presentation here at<br>telangana waka victoria university of<br>wellington<br>we talk about trimesters lots of other<br>universities or other and city places<br>you might have heard<br>um them refer to them as semesters<br>they're exactly the same thing<br>but we'd talk about trimester one so<br>february to june<br>trimester two which is july till october<br>and then our summer school period<br>we refer to that as trimester three so<br>that's november to february<br>we do have courses on offer over that<br>trimester three period<br>and we do find that our professional<br>students while they're working they do<br>sometimes like to take courses in that<br>period<br>so you can study at three different<br>points throughout the year so that's why<br>we call them trimesters<br>so the minimum duration for the masters<br>like it says on the screen<br>it's four trimesters so it takes just<br>over a year to complete<br>the delivery mode i've already talked<br>about it's a modular and block<br>so that's meaning that you come in for<br>those full days spread out every six<br>months or<br>not six months six weeks or so<br>the location option so where you'll<br>actually be studying<br>you do have a choice in these two<br>programs you can<br>either be coming to class or for a lot<br>of them you can be<br>engaging online and so through<br>synchronous or asynchronous teaching so<br>it means that if<br>you might be attending class through<br>zoom and you're involved in the<br>discussions that are going on<br>um throughout their their class time and<br>and finally i'm just mentioned the<br>intakes so that we do have<br>intakes across the three trimesters<br>predominantly trimester one is typically<br>the most common time that people start<br>so that's february<br>you can start in july though and we do<br>if you start at a different trimester<br>want to make sure you have a good course<br>plan if you're wanting to study<br>full-time<br>so you can take the right courses to<br>help you finish your study in the<br>shortest period<br>and and finally we do have some people<br>who start in november<br>again we do like to have a chat with you<br>if you're thinking about starting in<br>november<br>particularly with if you're studying<br>part-time that's more of an option<br>and we can just make sure you're taking<br>the right course so<br>most common for people to start in<br>february but we can<br>help you if you are thinking about<br>studying in different periods<br>and and then right there at the bottom<br>that i've got my the three<br>qualifications that fall underneath this<br>header<br>so postgraduate certificate and public<br>policy postgraduate diploma<br>and then the masters as well<br>now i'm just going to talk through the<br>structure of the this program so<br>um for the master of public policy there<br>you have a set of core or required<br>courses<br>now these courses are ones if you take<br>the full master's program<br>you have to take which is why we call<br>them the core courses<br>or the required courses these ones here<br>um are on the screen now so they are<br>courses<br>in governance or um quantitative<br>analysis<br>and you look at economics um policy<br>workshops so they're courses that are<br>really foundational to that the full<br>masters ones we<br>we want you to take and and so you can't<br>finish without doing these for the full<br>master's program<br>but then you have some flexibility and<br>amanda talked about<br>this so you have four elective courses<br>that you can um really pick and choose<br>what courses you want to take alongside<br>the the core courses<br>and they can be really from across the<br>wide range of offerings at the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government<br>so we do have um some um<br>more common electives that people<br>typically take so something like<br>e-government which is about digital<br>transformation in the government sector<br>and there's also health and well-being<br>courses that our students can take<br>and and if you take three in a<br>particular area you can actually get a<br>specialization in that<br>the particular subject so i definitely<br>encourage you to have a look<br>at what subjects you might want to be<br>taking alongside um or in this<br>particular program<br>and then finally for our master of<br>public policy<br>we have a research project so this one<br>is a little<br>it's a little bit bigger in terms of<br>workload than our other ones so it's a<br>30 point course<br>and that actually spans two trimesters<br>um<br>of study so a couple of things to note<br>if you<br>are studying part-time which a lot of<br>our students are<br>you do actually have some flexibility<br>with what courses you take in one<br>particular order<br>we do like you though to take your<br>research project<br>in your final trimester and and<br>some of our electives may require you to<br>have a particular background to get into<br>them<br>there are those some that you don't have<br>to have any knowledge in that particular<br>area so if you do want to have a chat<br>about those electives definitely get in<br>touch<br>so that's our public policy program uh<br>so if you do have any questions about<br>anything that haven't covered<br>please feel free to send them through to<br>the q a like we we've mentioned<br>and but now i am going to be talking<br>about the master of<br>public management now this program<br>here is is for people who are interested<br>in um<br>bringing that policy and putting it into<br>practice so it's it's managing people<br>managing organizations in in the public<br>sector<br>and having a really strong sense of<br>integrity and purpose<br>so the quick facts you'll see are quite<br>similar to the other program<br>it has a very similar duration and so<br>the 16 months or four trimesters<br>it's taught again in that same way<br>through modular or block format<br>um on campus and on online<br>and you can with this one start in those<br>trimesters but i will say again<br>if you are looking at studying full-time<br>and<br>it might not be possible to start in in<br>trimester three for example<br>um also trimester two so definitely have<br>a chat with us if you're thinking about<br>full-time study<br>but part-time study it's a little bit<br>more flexible for you when when you do<br>start<br>so the courses looks again very similar<br>to public policy so we do<br>have that that core there or those<br>required courses<br>but these ones do vary from what you<br>would be taking in the public policy<br>program<br>so you'll notice that the names here are<br>a bit different so it's looking at<br>public managers<br>managing for results and managing people<br>managing organizations<br>community organizations um<br>and then that you could have a choice of<br>quantitative analysis or research skills<br>public managers so here are the set of<br>those required or core courses<br>you also have the option to have<br>electives and this works in a really<br>similar way to that public policy<br>program<br>but what you'll notice for the public<br>management is you actually get a choice<br>of five electives<br>the specialization works in the same way<br>so you can specialize in e-government<br>health and well-being or our public<br>policy even so you can<br>give your program that unique flavor<br>that will help you with your career<br>goals or interest areas<br>and bring it into the the full masters<br>and then finally with this master of<br>public management program we have a<br>capstone course<br>so again that's a course we like you to<br>take in your final trimester<br>and that really brings together what<br>you've been studying across your<br>your time with us and and and bringing<br>everything you've you've kind of<br>learned and putting it into practice<br>so just before um we kind of kick into<br>that<br>what you need to start thinking about if<br>you want to be studying i do want to<br>mention<br>this pathway here so<br>when amanda was talking before about who<br>these there are um<br>programs and and you have work<br>experience requirement to get into them<br>we do have this option which we call a<br>graduate pathway<br>and this is for students who have just<br>finished a bachelor's degree<br>don't have that work experience but are<br>really interested about<br>moving into the public sector and field<br>and want to learn a little bit more so<br>this program you can<br>um so this pathway you can enroll in the<br>master of public policy or the master of<br>public management<br>um but to be accepted through the<br>graduate pathway so without that<br>work experience and we do look at your<br>grades from your undergraduate study<br>and there is a a cohort of students that<br>you would study alongside who've also<br>entered throughout this graduate pathway<br>and there is mental shipping and guide<br>and guidance throughout your<br>your program so if you are listening to<br>this webinar and and you've just<br>finished your bachelor's degree<br>definitely have a look into this<br>graduate pathway option<br>to apply there's all this information<br>online about it and there is a<br>scholarship that you can apply for<br>that you might accompany your study as<br>well<br>i will just quickly talk about the um<br>requirements or the next steps if you're<br>thinking about studying well with us<br>in either of the two programs that i've<br>been talking about this evening<br>so first i know we have quite a few<br>international students who've been<br>who are joining us to this webinar so if<br>you haven't been in touch with already i<br>recommend you contact wellington<br>university international<br>they're our wonderful international team<br>and they can help you with student visas<br>and talking about finances scholarships<br>and anything that you might have<br>questions about about moving to new<br>zealand or studying online<br>and at this point in time they are the<br>best people to help you and they'll be<br>able to<br>guide you through what you need to to be<br>considering<br>one of the amazing things though about<br>this particular program is we are<br>teaching<br>our courses online so you can get<br>started with your study<br>if you're overseas at the moment and<br>would like to start studying with us<br>then it's a really good option to be<br>considering that online learning<br>and next thing i want to touch is just<br>the finance we do get asked about this<br>quite a lot<br>so the fees that i have on my screen<br>right now they are for the full<br>masters program so how fees work<br>is typically per course that you're<br>completing<br>so if you are thinking about starting<br>with a certificate or the diploma<br>you can jump on our website and find out<br>what those fees are but for the domestic<br>students and international students for<br>the master's programs<br>and their fees are what i have on my<br>screen for 2021.<br>so another question i then get is is is<br>there any financial support or any<br>scholarships or anything i can apply for<br>so i definitely recommend you have a<br>look on our website<br>for we have a scholarship database so<br>that collates all of the scholarships<br>that are available for our students<br>and you can filter it and to fit your<br>certain criteria<br>i've just seen on the website it's just<br>been announced there is a scholarship<br>for<br>coursework and master's programs or<br>postgraduate programs<br>for 2021 for domestic students so if you<br>are<br>a domestic student and wanting to look<br>for a scholarship definitely jump on the<br>website have a look at that one<br>and and and apply for it if it matches<br>your criteria<br>another thing we get asked about is<br>study link so study link<br>is our student loan um provider<br>for new zealand students and so<br>definitely<br>start looking um at them start applying<br>it can take a little bit of time to<br>provide all the paperwork<br>so if you are getting a student loan<br>free study link jump online<br>and have a look at their website and<br>finally something i do just quickly want<br>to touch on<br>uh is our fees the fees free scheme so<br>this is for students who<br>haven't uh studied at tertiary level<br>before<br>and you can if you apply to one of our<br>programs and you don't have a bachelor's<br>degree<br>uh we can look at work experience it<br>goes through uh dr amanda wolfe<br>and and if you are eligible for that you<br>might also be eligible for the fees free<br>scheme<br>so definitely have a look through that<br>all the urls are on my screen<br>and some of them are not to do with the<br>university so<br>they're the best people to contact if<br>you do have questions about any of those<br>areas<br>uh finally just quickly touching on the<br>entry requirements and then how to apply<br>so typically our students are required<br>to have a bachelor's degree<br>it can be in any field you don't have to<br>have studied public policy or public<br>management<br>previously and we do ask you to have<br>that work experience though typically<br>so that's two years of work experience<br>in the public sector or the public<br>service<br>and this can be really really diverse so<br>i have some examples on my screen of<br>where people come from<br>and but amanda mentioned them before as<br>well we do have people who come from a<br>variety of backgrounds<br>and bring a wealth of experience into<br>the program<br>so definitely if you're not sure if you<br>you qualify please get<br>in touch with us we can have a chat with<br>you and and see if this is a good<br>program for you<br>and typically it's the two years of work<br>experience in the public sector or<br>public service<br>and then finally you need approval from<br>the academic program leader<br>so when you are applying international<br>students you can apply through<br>wellington university international<br>who were on the screen just a little bit<br>earlier and they approve your admission<br>and and then if you get approved then<br>you receive an offer of place<br>and you accept your offer of place for<br>domestic students it's quite<br>similar you do apply online as well and<br>and for both uh groups international and<br>domestic you do need to supply some<br>supporting<br>documents and what we mean there is a<br>thing is your cv<br>so when we ask for you to have work<br>experience get into the program<br>we would like to see your cv when you're<br>applying to see what you've been doing<br>the cv can just be like when you're<br>applying for a job it doesn't have to be<br>really any different<br>and it's just to see that work<br>experience that you have<br>you're also required to provide a a<br>reference<br>and a reference typically from your your<br>current employer<br>which accompanies your application and<br>then any academic transcripts or<br>previous study that you have you<br>have um have completed and then finally<br>you get accepted you have your approval<br>and you get accepted<br>and and then you get sent a thing called<br>an offer of study<br>and you're happy with that you click<br>accept if you are looking at studying<br>with us<br>in the new year so our february intake<br>our enrollments close on the 20th of<br>january<br>we definitely encourage you to apply<br>earlier than that because of all that<br>paperwork that i just mentioned<br>we typically say it's a good idea to<br>apply before christmas<br>and but if you can't do that that's<br>absolutely fine 20th of january is your<br>enrollment deadline<br>and so hopefully i've given you lots of<br>information<br>um and talked about the programs but i<br>am going to open<br>up to the the q a so what we'll do is<br>i'll<br>just bear with me while i bring it up on<br>my screen i'm going to invite<br>um amanda back and we're going to just<br>go through those questions that<br>hopefully have been being sent in while<br>speaking<br>perfect so i'm not sure if you can see<br>the questions amanda but the first<br>one here is if you choose to do a course<br>online<br>do you still need to come in person um<br>in person classes every six weeks<br>so i'll hand over to you to answer that<br>one yes and thank you for that question<br>i saw that it popped up quite a while<br>a while ago and poppy may have already<br>touched on that<br>we're really happy to be able to<br>accommodate people who study in<br>wellington<br>face to face or throughout new zealand<br>and are able to travel in<br>uh to study in these block um<br>that block uh days that poppy mentioned<br>but equally<br>every course that we offer in 2021<br>is also available for remote study and<br>what we mean by that<br>is that you're able to achieve<br>all the learning objectives of the<br>course without ever setting foot in<br>wellington<br>each course has a slightly different way<br>of achieving that<br>sometimes you zoom in to the lecture<br>room where the face-to-face students are<br>meeting at the same time<br>and there's a fair bit of interaction<br>between people<br>who are coming in from zoom and people<br>in the room<br>sometimes you're watching along with the<br>people in wellington<br>uh pre-recorded videos and then coming<br>together in discussion groups<br>either with people mixed throughout the<br>enrollment wherever they may be in the<br>world or specific questions<br>uh sorry specific discussions organized<br>for people on zoom<br>versus people face to face so the short<br>answer is yes you can study without ever<br>coming<br>to wellington and we think that's a<br>really<br>exciting development that we all know<br>what has triggered it but we're really<br>on board with it<br>and again if you have any concerns about<br>it<br>time of day issues internet connectivity<br>things like that just have a chat with<br>me and we'll go through what you might<br>need<br>and what might be required for you to<br>actively<br>so there's another question here poppy<br>shall i take it<br>is it still possible to enroll to start<br>the start part time<br>in trimester three it's getting really<br>tight because the trimester actually<br>starts on the 9th<br>of november however<br>depends on how quickly that paperwork<br>can get<br>um<br>it depends i think we better just have<br>you have a wechat with poppy about that<br>but definitely not too late for<br>we've either done a very good job of<br>explaining the programs or we've scared<br>people off oh no you've got another um<br>question coming in grades for yes<br>undergraduate grades for entry under the<br>graduate pathway<br>one thing you'll um have seen from<br>poppy's slide<br>on the entry requirements as there are<br>three<br>specific requirements one has to do with<br>your bachelor's degree<br>one has to do with your work experience<br>and one has to do with<br>essentially my judgment of what the<br>package looks like<br>and that allows me to take into account<br>your referee report<br>your interest in the program<br>the grad pathway does ask for two<br>references as opposed to one<br>it also asks you for a short statement<br>sort of in the range of 300 words<br>that tell us a little bit more about you<br>and<br>people who are shortlisted for entry in<br>the grad pathway<br>will also have an interview so what that<br>means<br>is that yes grades matter but they're<br>not the only thing<br>and we look at the full range of what<br>you offer<br>and to some degree that goes for anybody<br>applying for graduate study because<br>guess what<br>we want you to succeed we don't want you<br>just to get into the front door<br>we want you to gain a tremendous<br>experience while you're here<br>all that said for graduate pathway entry<br>we really are hoping to see something in<br>the range<br>question about where can i find elective<br>options um we're<br>actually in the process of trying to<br>pull together<br>lists all in one place it's one of those<br>weird things<br>in that i think as papi has indicated<br>you can take an elective from a huge<br>range<br>of topics so the really quick answer is<br>just have a look around the university<br>and you can see what<br>the electives that you might use that<br>you might take<br>are there is a a limit<br>on the level however so for credit in<br>the master's or certificate or diploma<br>they need to be four or 500 level<br>courses<br>probably shortly by the towards the end<br>of the year we'll have more specific<br>information<br>which lists electives not only that you<br>can take but that actually fit nicely<br>into your schedule<br>because believe it or not that can be<br>one of the most difficult things to<br>organize<br>because if you think of it if you're<br>taking required courses<br>but also having to slot in electives you<br>have to be sure they don't clash<br>so we're working on that and again<br>probably the best thing is for you to<br>get in touch with me<br>and say this is what i'd like to study<br>am i going to be able to do it easily or<br>a question about is there support for<br>finding work post graduation<br>in the field internships etc<br>we have a fabulous team of career<br>advisors at the university<br>and we really feel that they're<br>your best port of call for specific<br>advice on<br>job opportunities every year there are<br>job fairs as well where employers come<br>into rutherford house and set up booths<br>and<br>talk to people about work opportunities<br>because so many of our students are<br>already employed<br>uh in the public sector or um<br>international students who are on a<br>leave from their job<br>we actually don't have a huge number of<br>people who are<br>actively looking for work study<br>that said your network of of<br>peers in the program who are already in<br>work<br>may be one of your best connections for<br>getting<br>uh advice on job opportunities<br>uh finally we do have an opportunity for<br>you to study<br>uh your res to undertake your research<br>project in the mpp or as an elective in<br>the mpm<br>with a sponsor agency and that's our<br>response<br>to what is often offered as an<br>internship<br>internationally so in that uh setting<br>you undertake a research study but you<br>do it for an<br>agency with sponsorship and you work<br>a question about specializations i think<br>we have a minute more don't we poppy we<br>do yeah<br>specializations are a special note<br>on your transcript that indicates that<br>you have concentrated<br>your electives in a particular area<br>usually that is by a subject code<br>so the simplest example is a public<br>policy student who<br>specializes in public management by<br>taking three courses<br>in public management you may<br>also take uh courses in the range of<br>specializations that are offered<br>throughout the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government and those are indicated on<br>your transcript<br>uh regardless of how it's indicated<br>you specialize you you choose your<br>subjects you choose what you want to<br>know more about<br>and then you're able to present yourself<br>through your cv<br>and at an interview as having a certain<br>base of knowledge<br>and that's really what we're trying to<br>foster with the way we've<br>embedded flexibility into our degree<br>structure<br>those are fast fantastic questions i<br>really want to acknowledge everyone<br>who's turned up this evening and again<br>just encourage you to follow up with the<br>question to me by email<br>or to poppy and her team in the<br>i think that might be all the questions<br>that have come through<br>so um i i want to reiterate what amanda<br>said please definitely get in touch if<br>you do have any questions<br>and we're more than happy to help you<br>work out a little bit more about the<br>programs<br>and help you with those elective<br>offerings and so please definitely get<br>in touch but<br>i think for now that's all the questions<br>that are coming through and we've got 6<br>15 on the dot so we're perfect to add to<br>timing there<br>and so we will leave you this evening<br>and or morning wherever you are zooming<br>in from<br>and but for now i'd like to say thank<br>you so much for joining us<br>and have a wonderful day evening morning<br>marta</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
