attendees<br>who are joining throughout the world and<br>eita aura<br>my name is ryan gammon and i'm one of<br>the international managers here at new<br>zealand's leading<br>research-led university the university<br>of auckland<br>thank you so much for joining us today<br>our final webinar of the shaping the<br>future webinar series<br>at the university of auckland our panel<br>discussion today will be focusing on<br>shaping the future through engineering<br>design<br>and business innovation now we're<br>extremely lucky to be joined such<br>uh by an exemplar set of panelists<br>representing the faculty of engineering<br>the school of design and the business<br>school so a very warm welcome to our<br>panelists<br>who i will be introducing later on in<br>today's session<br>now today's session will be structured<br>as follow um we will begin with a short<br>introduction<br>and overview of new zealand's number one<br>university<br>the university of auckland which will be<br>followed by our panelists providing<br>introduction<br>on their research teaching and interests<br>this will then be followed by a set of<br>questions for each of our panelists<br>finishing up with a q a section for our<br>attendees to pose those questions<br>to our panelists and join in on the<br>fascinating discussion<br>now before we get started i do just want<br>to mention a few housekeeping rules<br>on how uh on how today's session will go<br>forward<br>um so i know lots of you will have lots<br>of questions<br>as we kick off the discussion but what i<br>would ask you to do is please just wait<br>right until the end of the uh today's<br>session where we do have a q a section<br>and also after today's uh session we<br>will be emailing you<br>uh with a recording of today's webinar<br>and we will also be including<br>um a few really useful links that may<br>have been mentioned<br>uh throughout the discussion today<br>now what i'll do is i'm just going to<br>kick off our slides and just to give you<br>a nice<br>overview of the university of auckland<br>and hopefully some of you<br>may know where we are in ayodora in new<br>zealand<br>um so just a few quick facts about the<br>university of auckland so we are new<br>zealand's<br>largest university we have around 42 000<br>students<br>um alongside 5 000 staff so extremely<br>large<br>and comprehensive university located<br>right in the heart<br>of the city of auckland or the city of<br>sales if you know us well<br>now we're not only new zealand's leading<br>university we're also ranked number one<br>in new zealand but we're also ranked<br>81st in the world globally<br>via the qs world rankings which we're<br>extremely proud of<br>and not only that in the time higher<br>education rankings<br>were also ranked in the top 150 in the<br>world<br>and we have around 16 different subject<br>areas which are ranked in the top 50 so<br>that's absolutely fantastic<br>now we're also home to around or over<br>8 000 international students from over<br>120 different countries which really do<br>represent<br>the vibrancy and diversity here in the<br>city of auckland so we're really really<br>proud<br>and we celebrate all of our<br>international students who do join us<br>at this wonderful institution now i also<br>just want to highlight that we are<br>ranked number one in new zealand<br>for graduate employability and that<br>really does just speak volumes<br>um about our alumni and about the<br>fantastic employment opportunities our<br>students gain<br>post completion of their program with us<br>now um as i said we're an extremely<br>large institution here in the heart of<br>the city of auckland and we are home to<br>eight faculties and an abundance of<br>campuses<br>in and around auckland and that's where<br>these faculties are based so we have<br>arts<br>and some of the fantastic subjects in<br>arts are politics<br>policy media global studies and so forth<br>we're also home to the number one<br>business school<br>in new zealand and again that's in<br>accounting finance management<br>international business global management<br>and innovation<br>and i'm sure christine will be talking<br>about some of that innovation and<br>entrepreneurship later on as well<br>we're also home to the faculty of<br>creative arts and industry<br>so architecture urban planning fine arts<br>music<br>and design and again i'm sure carla will<br>be talking about design later on<br>we're also home to education social work<br>engineering so<br>civil structural mechanical and again we<br>also have electrical and electronics<br>computer systems software engineering<br>and robotics and bruce will be touching<br>on that later on as well<br>we also have a fantastic law faculty<br>number one in new zealand<br>and home to a medical health and<br>sciences faculty again<br>up in grafton and then we have our<br>largest faculty<br>which is the faculty of science as well<br>what i would encourage you all to do<br>after today's session if you are<br>interested in some of these fascinating<br>subjects<br>please do go on to the university of<br>auckland website after today<br>have a look around on there and you'll<br>really get a great indication about some<br>of the wonderful programs we do have on<br>offer<br>now um i also just want to take this<br>opportunity just to highlight how uh<br>globalized as a university we are and<br>all of our<br>uh international links so we are part of<br>the apro<br>also the universitas 21 as well as the<br>world university network as well so<br>we have over 180 different partners in<br>around 45 countries<br>so we also have a fantastic opportunity<br>for students to go on exchange<br>and study abroad as part of their<br>undergraduate degree which i highly<br>recommend<br>if you do come and study with us as well<br>now one of the final things i do want to<br>mention about the university of auckland<br>that's probably most important<br>particularly for today's session is for<br>a second year running the university of<br>auckland<br>has been ranked number one in the world<br>in the times higher education<br>global impact rankings for universities<br>and we're extremely proud of that<br>accolade so not only were we ranked<br>number one in 2019 but we're also ranked<br>number one again<br>in 2020 and as you can see on that slide<br>you can see<br>all of the sustainable development goals<br>which is set by the united nations<br>so we're extremely proud of that we are<br>ranked overall number one<br>and again you know probably after<br>today's discussion you'll you'll see the<br>reasons why<br>now i do just want to take this<br>opportunity because as i said to<br>introduce our exemplar panelists who are<br>so lucky to be joining us from<br>engineering design<br>and the business school so i'm going to<br>introduce<br>professor bruce mcdonald so bruce is a<br>professor at the faculty of engineering<br>in the electrical and electronic<br>computer systems<br>and software engineering department and<br>bruce's long-term goal is to design<br>intelligent robotic assistance to<br>improve the quality of people's lives<br>and his primary research interests are<br>in human robotic interaction<br>and robot programming systems in<br>applications such as healthcare and<br>agriculture<br>he is currently the director of the<br>department's robotics group<br>and he's also leader of the<br>multi-disciplinary<br>center for automation robotics<br>engineering science robotics team<br>at the university of auckland so thank<br>you for joining us bruce<br>we also have uh lecturer carla amaral<br>who is part of the faculty of creative<br>arts and industry<br>in the school of design and uh carla is<br>a designer researcher and educator<br>and she is interested in the areas of<br>transformative service design<br>health and well-being and she's<br>currently involved in research focusing<br>on how digital platforms<br>can empower people with physical<br>disabilities in their mobility<br>experiences so a massive warm welcome to<br>you carla<br>and we also have associate professor<br>christine woods from the number one<br>business school in new zealand<br>um in entrepreneurship and innovation<br>and christine woods is a specialist in<br>entrepreneurship and innovation<br>in the business school and currently<br>teaches entrepreneurship at<br>undergraduate and postgraduate level<br>which is also a research area of uh in<br>family businesses<br>small and medium-sized businesses and<br>growth social entrepreneurship<br>maori entrepreneur entrepreneurship<br>sorry and<br>entrepreneurial behavior so um a massive<br>warm welcome to you christine it's great<br>to have you here<br>now i'm going to hand over to our first<br>uh panelist which is professor bruce<br>mcdonald and<br>great thank you ryan and welcome<br>everybody to the webinar today<br>thank you for coming along so i'm just<br>going to talk a little bit about our<br>robotics work i guess everybody's<br>dreamed of a future of robots and some<br>of the<br>dreams you can see there on the screen<br>okay<br>next slide thanks chris so as ryan said<br>our goal is to make robot<br>technologies that improve well-being for<br>everybody<br>in our whole society and we have a focus<br>on impact so<br>that is making things actually happen<br>you know from the research we do in the<br>real world<br>that actually do make things better for<br>people on a large scale<br>and overall we try to include<br>everybody who's related to the research<br>all the people who might use our work<br>and all the people who you know there<br>might be an effect on it and could get<br>benefits from it<br>and that helps us design the research<br>and make it work for everybody<br>cute so as ryan said our group is called<br>cares the center for automation and<br>robotic<br>engineering science and there's our goal<br>again and we have a number of work<br>streams<br>mainly about making robot devices and<br>software for robots<br>and then we focus on the healthcare<br>application area<br>and on agriculture as well mostly on<br>horticulture which we'll see soon<br>and then we need to transfer that<br>technology from the university<br>researchers into businesses that can<br>actually use it for something useful to<br>deliver that um<br>well-being for everybody and uh one of<br>the focuses we have<br>is about humans and robots working<br>together from a research point of view<br>we don't know much about what it's like<br>to have robots everywhere you don't<br>see them that often so we're doing a lot<br>of studies about that<br>and so we take a simple approach we have<br>a lot of co-design with our<br>end users we generally design what the<br>robot should do<br>by understanding the scenario the robot<br>will be in<br>the context it will be in and what<br>people actually need the robot to do<br>either in healthcare or in<br>farming or whatever application<br>so we try and bring a lot of different<br>researchers together<br>and we work with you know healthcare<br>experts and engineers<br>computing people social scientists<br>and psychologists to understand the<br>robot and then<br>various people from industry government<br>and commercialisation and looking to see<br>what the future will be like<br>thank you i just want to mention a bit<br>about our healthcare<br>robots in action this shows one of our<br>healthcare robots<br>interacting with a patient and a<br>researcher and so we had<br>some government funding and some<br>international funding to develop robots<br>to help<br>older people to help them live<br>independently alone<br>and so the robots were reminding them to<br>do their daily<br>activities answering some of their<br>questions<br>recording some vital signs and enabling<br>a human health care person to kind of<br>supervise lots of people<br>through the internet with the robot as<br>the delivery device<br>and we had a lot of robots in in rest<br>homes<br>and in older people's homes to<br>understand how that would work and what<br>people thought about it<br>thank you and then on the farming side<br>or agriculture side we're focused mainly<br>on horticulture and some of the<br>challenges there are about labor<br>shortages new zealand's<br>suffering dramatically at the moment not<br>enough people to pick kiwi fruit<br>not enough people to pick the apple<br>harvest and not enough people to help<br>with<br>with a cherry harvest and so on so<br>there's actually quite a lot of jobs in<br>those<br>areas we want to create technology that<br>can help<br>farmers automate those tasks and<br>and reduce their the labor shortages<br>that are<br>quality<br>so one of our projects that we've<br>finished was a project to make a robot<br>to harvest kiwifruit so we worked with a<br>company<br>just out of auckland and they already<br>had the first version<br>we made subsequent versions and improved<br>the performance of the robot kiwi fruit<br>harvester<br>so we can harvest most of the kiwi fruit<br>in an orchard now<br>and then we transfer that technology to<br>the company and they're<br>working on commercializing it to make<br>kiwifruit harvesters that can be<br>sold overseas in improved new zealand's<br>export economy we also made a robot<br>module that went on the same robot to<br>pollinate kiwifruit flowers because<br>kiwi fruit bees don't really like<br>pollinating kiwi fruits so there's an<br>opportunity to use automation to<br>and our current project in horticulture<br>is about<br>helping humans who work in orchards and<br>vineyards<br>to help them make better decisions it's<br>a government-funded project<br>and has six different research<br>organizations working together<br>and so we're the lead organization and<br>the other five organizations all have<br>you know post docs and phd students and<br>undergrad students sometimes and master<br>students working<br>on different parts of this project and<br>then we're coordinating it all together<br>to develop technology that will record a<br>lot of data about plants<br>to enable us to manage plants at a pla<br>an orchard at a plant level<br>and make models the 3d models of the<br>plants<br>then understand uh for example the three<br>case studies are<br>pruning grape vines thinning the little<br>fruitlets off apple trees because<br>there's usually too many apples on an<br>apple tree<br>and harvesting blueberries so we're<br>working on all of those things so that<br>we can actually<br>help humans make a better job of that<br>task using<br>augmented reality to tell people you<br>know prune here prune there<br>pick this pick that or whatever task it<br>is people will do<br>and then the final step was to use<br>robots to automate those<br>tasks so that a company can have a robot<br>service to provide to all the growers in<br>an area<br>and that robot can go around and do all<br>those tasks<br>for the growers and save some<br>time and money and alleviate the labour<br>shortage that<br>i think that's your last side there<br>bruce and so thank you so much<br>um so we're gonna move on now to uh<br>carla<br>and uh who's gonna be talking about<br>design<br>so thank you so much bruce so over to<br>you carla<br>thank you so much ryan thanks for the<br>introduction and thanks everyone for<br>being here<br>um kyota my name is carla and i'm here<br>representing<br>um the school of design today and as<br>brian uh mentioned earlier we are part<br>of the create<br>creative arts and industries faculty<br>so if we go to the next slide uh here on<br>the screen you can see<br>what our ideal graduate profile looks<br>like so basically<br>in design we think that everyone that<br>joins<br>a design journey here at the university<br>of auckland will leave<br>being able to<br>have these skills that you can see on<br>the screen so for example<br>we focus on teaching people how to<br>listen hard we believe that one of the<br>main skills that that a designer needs<br>to have<br>is to be able to interview people and<br>understand<br>their needs and find opportunities um<br>for positive interventions in their<br>lives<br>so to be able to understand that it's<br>really important to<br>analyze forensically so that's another<br>area<br>that we think designers need to learn<br>and develop<br>so basically that means people need to<br>be able to carefully<br>investigate which people places and<br>things a project can affect<br>so slowly design is moving away from the<br>traditional areas such as<br>graphic and product design and moving<br>into<br>more contemporary areas such as<br>experience design service design<br>and i'm going to talk a little bit about<br>that later and if you have any questions<br>about that please feel free to ask us<br>um in the end uh but all those skills<br>commit commits early prototypes rapidly<br>tests authentically and plans<br>strategically those are<br>all skills that designers should have if<br>they want to operate in these<br>contemporary areas because basically the<br>idea is not to focus only<br>on the aesthetical part of designing a<br>product or a service<br>or a website or a game but also also<br>understanding the potential<br>impacts that that can have in people's<br>lives communities<br>um nature and the world as a whole<br>so if we go to the next slide now thank<br>you<br>this is how we teach those skills so<br>basically<br>um in design we think about methods<br>the making and the studio so methods are<br>about<br>how and why we design so basically<br>thinking about how we can turn ideas<br>into something real and how can we know<br>if something works or doesn't work so<br>basically<br>methods and models they help us<br>understand why and how<br>things work and the studio is where we<br>bring<br>um everything together so basically<br>studio practice means<br>people get together to work on a project<br>to collaborate<br>and to learn how to work both<br>independently<br>and collaboratively with others with<br>industries and with um communities<br>and making is about experimenting with<br>materials technologies playing and<br>testing ideas<br>and learning new technical skills so<br>design<br>is about learning about technology<br>learning how to use software learning<br>how to<br>understand emerging technologies and how<br>emerging technologies can actually<br>influence the world that we live in<br>but also developing that criticality<br>through models and methods that help us<br>understand potential<br>impacts so this is how we<br>when we think we can future proof<br>design graduates at the university of<br>auckland<br>to be able to collaborate and<br>sustainably<br>practice design in the future<br>thank you brilliant thank you so much<br>color one more slide<br>for design okay sorry basically these<br>are all the areas that we<br>think design can contribute to so<br>basically<br>instead of focusing on particular design<br>traditional disciplines we think that<br>the way the discipline is evolving and<br>the way<br>global challenges are emerging and the<br>way technologies<br>is developing design will be able to<br>collaborate with people from many other<br>disciplines<br>and design can be applied into all the<br>context that you can see on the screen<br>so basically we can think about design<br>for sustainability<br>designed for big data for change for<br>well-being<br>for culture entertainment and society<br>as a whole so it's a little bit about<br>breaking silos<br>and learning about how to be<br>collaborative<br>strategic and innovative and i'm sure<br>christine will talk a little bit more<br>about innovation soon<br>so thank you very much for listening<br>to me and if you have any questions i'm<br>happy to answer them<br>later on thank you thank you so much<br>carla<br>um so over to you christine<br>uh kia ora koto uh welcome and thank you<br>very much for<br>joining us and um for just you know<br>allowing us to give you a small window<br>into what we do here at the university<br>of auckland<br>now in ryan's background you can see<br>auckland the<br>larger landmass of auckland and you can<br>also see the clock tower<br>which is part of the university uh in<br>this slide you can see the business<br>school<br>so this is the university of auckland um<br>business school and hopefully one day<br>some of you will<br>be able to come along and actually walk<br>through the doors<br>so i'm an associate professor there and<br>my area is entrepreneurship and<br>innovation<br>specifically in the area of<br>entrepreneurship and i don't know if<br>anyone is joining us<br>from malawi but i spent a little bit of<br>time in malawi<br>and i kind of joke that that's where i<br>caught entrepreneurship<br>instead of malaria and my jokes don't<br>get any better than that<br>so if we go to the next slide um<br>i'm an academic but i love this<br>interface between<br>theory and practice so what do we mean<br>when we talk about<br>innovation and entrepreneurship so<br>here's a couple of very small<br>definitions<br>that will hopefully help you make sense<br>of these two areas if you don't already<br>uh know what they are so what we're<br>talking about with innovation are<br>processes for taking ideas with the<br>degree of novelty<br>and getting them into widely used<br>practice and what bruce has provided<br>is a perfect example of innovation in<br>practice<br>so there's these amazing inventions with<br>robotics<br>and then the innovation part is how do<br>we get them<br>into practice so that's a perfect<br>perfect illustration of that<br>then sitting alongside that is<br>entrepreneurship so by entrepreneurship<br>what we mean<br>is those people those owners of those<br>businesses for example that identified<br>opportunities<br>where the robotics could come into a<br>kiwifruit orchard<br>and enable that business to grow so<br>identifying and constructing<br>opportunities and most importantly<br>taking action<br>because we can all have a whole lot of<br>great ideas but unless they get put into<br>practice<br>then what's the point so what i thought<br>i'd also do<br>is just give you a little overview of<br>what an undergraduate<br>major and innovation and<br>entrepreneurship would look like<br>so in the next slide ryan what you can<br>see<br>is that we've got stage two and stage<br>three courses now of course we do<br>post graduate masters phds in innovation<br>and entrepreneurship as well but this is<br>just to give you a little bit of a sense<br>of what we do so the entrepreneurial<br>mindset course this is at our second<br>in our second year so we have three year<br>undergraduate degrees<br>so this is in your second year and that<br>entrepreneurial mindset<br>paper is open to anybody across the<br>university to be able to take that<br>alongside those people those of you that<br>might choose to do a major<br>then the second paper is looking at<br>understanding<br>entrepreneurial opportunities now we<br>then build on that<br>in stage three looking at the<br>ecosystems um what's the ecosystem that<br>exists so the example with um<br>that bruce gave for example if you think<br>about industry<br>if you think about research if you think<br>about<br>um venture capitalists and private<br>equity that then finance different<br>innovations that's what we're talking<br>about with the ecosystem<br>and then the other paper is is a<br>project-based paper<br>so for example you might get the<br>opportunity<br>to work with one of the kiwi fruit<br>growers<br>and they have opportunities or problems<br>that they need addressing<br>and so you as a student get the<br>opportunity to work on real life<br>problems<br>because again remember i talked about<br>this idea of theory and practice<br>so what are the skills what's what's<br>that what are the frameworks that we can<br>provide you with as academics<br>that then you partner with industry<br>to be able to grow sustainable<br>businesses<br>so that's a really fundamental part of<br>what we endeavor to do<br>um in the programs that we offer at an<br>undergraduate<br>and at a postgraduate level<br>in addition to what we do with the um<br>with the bachelor's and master's<br>programs we also have a variety of<br>extracurricular<br>activities going on so in this slide we<br>talk<br>and the next side sorry ryan we talk<br>about<br>velocity so velocity has been going<br>since 2003<br>and this is open to any student or staff<br>member<br>to be able to enter into these business<br>planning<br>idea planning idea generation<br>competitions and opportunities so we<br>have ignite<br>which is up to a hundred thousand<br>dollars<br>and and you can enter um as a team<br>with your idea we have innovation series<br>where we have a variety of different<br>speakers that come<br>in and share their real world experience<br>we have a challenge a thousand words for<br>a thousand dollars<br>um and and again that's open to<br>any student across the university and<br>then we have<br>different programs so innovate to<br>business is a<br>one-day startup program where you can<br>come in and prototype<br>um look at expanding on the idea that<br>you've got and seeing if it is a viable<br>opportunity so if you want to find out a<br>little bit more about that in our center<br>for innovation<br>and entrepreneurship might be a great<br>thing to<br>um to google so really looking forward<br>to your questions<br>um and we'll talk with you again soon<br>thank you so much christine that's<br>absolutely fascinating thank you<br>and i remember uh going through velocity<br>at some point as well that looks like an<br>awesome program for<br>business school students um so we're now<br>just going to go on to some of our first<br>questions for our panelists and again<br>this is really looking at<br>essentially what do you think are some<br>of the most important global challenges<br>to address in the next five to 25 years<br>now i know<br>the immediate concern is really looking<br>at obviously<br>we're currently in a pandemic covert 19<br>is really taking up<br>everything right now but if we look in<br>the next five years maybe post covert 19<br>it'd be great to hear um from you bruce<br>you know what are some of the challenges<br>that you think<br>um that we should be addressing in the<br>next five to 25 years<br>yeah thanks ryan um well i guess for me<br>you know climate change is a big one<br>and um although all of the sustainable<br>development goals i think are<br>excellently selected and we we need to<br>think about all of them<br>the other one is people's you know<br>well-being so<br>you know gdp per capita doesn't really<br>cut it anymore<br>so we should be thinking about how can<br>we make everybody's life<br>you know rich and healthy and happy<br>and enjoyable so the the economic part<br>is really important we really need to<br>have a strong<br>economies in our country so that we can<br>do the things we need to do for climate<br>change and so that people will accept it<br>and so for me that's about creating<br>technology that can help people<br>um be our society more productive and<br>generate new jobs for people<br>and new things to do fantastic yeah<br>i can completely uh concur there um you<br>know trying to convince the uh<br>naysayers about climate change you know<br>they're more worried about<br>their pocket as opposed to tackling the<br>issue so i completely agree with you<br>there<br>um and carla for you uh you know in<br>particular with design<br>um what would you say uh would would you<br>agree with bruce there or<br>are there other things that maybe you<br>think we should be looking to address in<br>the next five to 25 years<br>i definitely agree with bruce i think<br>climate change is definitely a big<br>challenge that we should<br>that we should all um worry about and<br>try to<br>find solutions and find potential um<br>designs and or even like technologies<br>that can help us tackle that wicked<br>problem that is<br>climate change i also think for example<br>in design<br>in terms of emerging technologies um<br>artificial intelligence is something<br>that<br>uh it's a challenge but it's also an<br>opportunity<br>for us um to potentially work with that<br>and think about the ethics of ai<br>think about um the potential impacts<br>that ai can have in everyday life<br>and the the potential that ai also has<br>to reduce inequalities so i think<br>reducing inequalities<br>uh to promote good health well-being and<br>tackle wicked issues such as<br>um global climate change<br>is really important yeah totally agree<br>there<br>thank you so much carla and uh christine<br>i wondered if you could<br>add as well to how you know innovation<br>and entrepreneurship can help obviously<br>small and medium-sized businesses to<br>address those<br>uh concerns as well yeah i think<br>alongside you know issues around climate<br>change and well-being<br>you know there's those issues around<br>poverty and<br>inequality that that we're facing um<br>as well and so for me one of the<br>exciting areas of entrepreneurship yes<br>there are things that small and<br>medium-sized businesses are doing but<br>sitting alongside that has been the<br>growth of social entrepreneurship<br>and so what we're talking about with<br>social entrepreneurship<br>our entrepreneurs looking for<br>opportunities for social change<br>so again it can relate to the<br>innovations that bruce was talking to<br>about carla your work around disability<br>designing for<br>for um around disability so i think<br>one of the the great things about<br>working with students over the last<br>kind of 10 to 15 years has been this<br>emergence around<br>this this drive that for a lot of you as<br>young people<br>for social change for addressing<br>inequality for addressing poverty<br>and that social entrepreneurship can<br>provide<br>an avenue for doing that so it's yeah<br>it's really exciting<br>yeah to completely agree there as well<br>christine and that actually leads us<br>quite well into our next question which<br>is essentially<br>you know what role do we think or you<br>know should universities play<br>in addressing some of these massive<br>challenges you've all highlighted there<br>so<br>i'll go straight to you bruce again if<br>that's okay<br>you know how do you think universities<br>uh you know how what role can they play<br>in addressing<br>you know climate change and<br>yeah thanks ryan that's a really good<br>question<br>i think our universities have multiple<br>roles<br>a lot of it's about people and<br>capability and so<br>one of them one of the roles is to is to<br>train you know the students who go<br>through the university<br>to understand those issues that we've<br>just talked about really well<br>and to be able to then go and work and<br>you know for companies in the world and<br>governments in the world<br>to make those things better and to solve<br>those issues<br>so there's a role for the training but<br>it has to be training the right kinds of<br>things so that<br>people have a really clear understanding<br>of what's happening<br>and then secondly the universities have<br>a role to provide expertise directly<br>so if people want some technical<br>expertise<br>or some design expertise or business<br>expertise they can go to experts at the<br>university and get direct<br>assistance to do whatever it is they<br>want to do<br>and then of course universities have<br>also have a role<br>as a conscience of society to try and<br>you know highlight those things to talk<br>in the media to give public talks<br>to talk about what they're doing and<br>that that strong understanding of what's<br>happening<br>in the world yeah that can be informed<br>yeah yeah that's fantastic and i suppose<br>you know<br>we we're doing that to train obviously<br>students and highlight those big issues<br>in society<br>but you know as part of being you know<br>the number one university in new zealand<br>but also being so globally connected<br>i guess it allows us also to share our<br>expertise where<br>you know some of those really really<br>important things<br>related to climate change you know we<br>can help our partners<br>overseas as well absolutely yeah<br>yeah um and carla just going to you<br>um you know from your perspective you<br>know how<br>how do you think or you know how should<br>universities be addressing<br>uh some of these challenges we've just<br>highlighted sure<br>i think i agree with everything that<br>bruce just said and i think<br>in addition to that um the university of<br>auckland has<br>a lot of resources available for<br>students to<br>experiment and test new ideas and<br>it's a space for learning but also for<br>creativity<br>it's a space for tackling big challenges<br>and what's unique about the university<br>of auckland is that we can do we can<br>look at<br>local practices so we can think about<br>indigenous knowledges we can think about<br>what's unique<br>to new zealand we can learn from this<br>and then we can take that<br>to the rest of the world so it's really<br>important i think for universities to<br>think about<br>micro and local solutions and then the<br>macro and global<br>challenges as well so we do need to<br>sometimes look at the small and<br>and baby steps that we can take along<br>the way before we go<br>into actually solving huge global uh<br>problems and i think that's really<br>unique to the university of auckland<br>totally agree yeah sometimes those<br>really small changes can have<br>a massive impact um so completely agree<br>and they're really practical you know<br>and things we can actually do now<br>um christine over to you in terms of you<br>know how do you see<br>universities playing a role in<br>addressing some of these challenges yeah<br>i<br>just want to pick up on on something<br>that carla mentioned earlier and also<br>what bruce was talking about this idea<br>of thinking<br>and questioning critically and being the<br>university being the conscience of<br>society so<br>sometimes we think innovation and<br>entrepreneurship equals good<br>well it doesn't always equal good social<br>entrepreneurship<br>may not always be good entrepreneurship<br>and innovation<br>of itself doesn't not necessarily equal<br>good<br>so what we're doing at the university<br>and i really like<br>carla's reference to sitting at what<br>what happens across our university is so<br>that we can<br>help you be able to critically think<br>about<br>what what innovation or what<br>entrepreneurship<br>is is happening so that then there is<br>some questioning about this that there<br>is an<br>understanding around the ethics of of<br>what's happening as well as the impact<br>around equality and poverty and<br>and climate change so i think that's<br>really<br>really important we have a really<br>important role to play in that<br>i completely agree i think that's<br>absolutely spot on<br>um now i'm just gonna move on to the<br>next question and bruce this is<br>predominantly for yourself<br>when we do look at the sustainable<br>development goals and in particular<br>sustainable development goal number<br>eight it's really looking at<br>decent work and economic growth um<br>which is one of the targets and it's<br>essentially to improve progressively<br>through to 2030<br>global resource efficiency in<br>consumption and production<br>and endeavor to decouple economic growth<br>from environmental degradation because<br>you know the more we grow all companies<br>want to make a profit and grow but<br>you know how that does that affects the<br>environment and it goes hand in hand<br>with what<br>everyone was talking about in relation<br>to climate change and helping to address<br>some of those challenges<br>so i'm just wondering you know based on<br>some of the research that you've done<br>bruce as well<br>you know how can robotics and automation<br>help to achieve<br>this goal you know how can we um<br>efficiently<br>con you know consume production and<br>endeavor to decouple economic growth<br>from environmental degradation<br>thanks ryan that's a good question um<br>well for me uh robotics and automation<br>are all about<br>improving productivity so generally you<br>only<br>automate something if you want to make<br>it better<br>and by usually you know by making it<br>more productive<br>so i think robotics can help create<br>you know help us do the things we need<br>to do<br>um more quickly and and more<br>robustly than maybe we're doing it at<br>the moment<br>and that decoupling the economic growth<br>from environmental degradation<br>means that we should be creating the<br>technology that will help with both of<br>those things<br>so that will be more productive and<br>the technology will improve the<br>environment so<br>you know robots to pick up rubbish or<br>clean the oceans or<br>whatever it is that you want to do and<br>certainly that will do the tasks you<br>want to do in factories<br>without creating the environmental<br>problems that we're<br>creating by doing it manually yeah so i<br>think we can do that if we just sit down<br>in each case<br>and design the technology for it yeah i<br>think that's great<br>and i have heard about some of those<br>robots that have that are being<br>developed about<br>clearing up the ocean and clearing up<br>plastic particularly in<br>certain cities which really you know<br>struggle with uh pollution<br>and and waste so that's that's really<br>really fascinating<br>um just moving on to the uh next<br>question<br>for for you bruce and again this<br>probably does definitely relate to some<br>of the research that you are conducting<br>it's essentially looking at you know<br>current trends in population aging<br>are particularly relevant for some of<br>the sustainable development goals<br>in relation to eradicating poverty and<br>ensuring healthy lives<br>and well-being at all ages uh promoting<br>gender equality<br>and decent work for all how is your work<br>in relation to<br>say health robotics for example helping<br>to address some of those challenges<br>facing countries particularly in the<br>west and<br>arguably in the northern hemisphere and<br>even in<br>yeah thanks ryan also there was a<br>question about this um so i'll try to<br>answer that at the same time<br>okay yeah so just to be clear our robots<br>are not designed to replace<br>humans because they'll always be the<br>need for<br>the human side of healthcare what the<br>robots are doing and when<br>we work with the humans who are doing<br>the healthcare<br>so that they can tell us what is it that<br>you would like<br>us to take off your hands so that<br>technology can do it for you<br>and one of those things is repetitive<br>simple repetitive tasks like reminding<br>older people to take their medication<br>for example<br>because we know that's a challenge or<br>reminding people to use their inhaler if<br>they have respiratory problems<br>or do their breathing exercises so<br>things that<br>you know a human would have to maybe for<br>district nursing care would have to get<br>in the car<br>drive around to the patient's place<br>knock on the door<br>say you know how are you going and how's<br>your medication doing<br>and so that's a very expensive resource<br>intense<br>process and so something that's<br>something that a robot can do easily<br>and can also report back by sending the<br>data back through the internet to<br>to a server so that the human<br>uh care worker can see that oh<br>everybody's taking their medication<br>that's all fine<br>this one person hasn't taken their<br>medication for the last two days so i<br>will<br>go around and see them because this<br>needs a human intervention<br>so we think the robots have a job to<br>help with those things<br>there's other things too like you know<br>moving<br>moving things around in hospitals just<br>transporting from one place to another<br>be amazed at how much logistic transport<br>there is<br>inside a hospital in some hospitals it<br>takes up a whole bank of elevators<br>for a half a day just to put it take<br>everything from the storage room<br>to the ward or to whichever office it's<br>needed<br>so robots can do that sort of stuff<br>maybe take the laundry<br>maybe deliver the milk to the staff room<br>there's a whole host of things that<br>could be done so we think robots have a<br>role and they can help people's health<br>care<br>and and and also record what's happening<br>vital signs and people's state of mind<br>by analyzing the interaction<br>so that the humans can decide where to<br>put the human effort<br>that's fascinating and yeah i like the<br>sound of a robot being able to do your<br>laundry<br>um that sounds something that we can<br>also use elsewhere as well<br>um so just moving on now to uh carla i<br>have a couple of questions for you<br>so um new zealand is currently<br>positioned as one of the best locations<br>in the world<br>in relation to educating for the future<br>and<br>um why do you think this is and would<br>you be able to talk a little bit about<br>how design plays into this<br>sure thanks for the question um i think<br>it's because when we think about the<br>future we think about it<br>with excitement here right like the<br>future is not<br>scary for us and one of the things<br>sometimes we talk about in design is<br>that<br>current people studying design by the<br>time they graduate<br>65 of these people will be working at<br>jobs that don't exist at the moment and<br>a lot of people think<br>oh okay so then how can we teach design<br>if we don't know the kinds of jobs that<br>will be available in the future<br>and that's exciting because that means<br>we can focus on developing<br>skills that can be applied to any<br>context in any scenario<br>and i think 2020 uh with covid it's the<br>perfect example that sometimes we try to<br>plan for the future and sometimes we<br>think we have things under control<br>but things change so i think<br>new zealand is positioned um especially<br>the university of auckland is a good<br>place<br>um to study because here we think about<br>resilience and we think about being<br>prepared for change and we think about<br>um looking at the future in a way that<br>we're trying to find opportunities and<br>we're trying to find<br>ways uh that we can all be future proof<br>and that we can all be prepared um for<br>whatever<br>the future is gonna look like and in<br>design it's something that we talk about<br>at the moment we do a lot of speculative<br>work so we try to think about<br>what's going to happen in 10 years time<br>in 20 years time and how can we make<br>sure we are<br>prepared for this no i think that's<br>fascinating and i guess a lot of that<br>also aligns<br>quite nicely with uh christine's work in<br>innovation<br>and entrepreneurship in you know really<br>helping to<br>be future proof i mean um who would have<br>thought that would be in a pandemic in<br>2020 i'm sure<br>you know a lot of businesses a lot of<br>companies organizations and even our<br>daily lives<br>um try to being you know future proof<br>from something like this happening<br>uh again is is definitely something we<br>want to work towards<br>definitely and something that we uh that<br>i'm noticing from<br>what bruce and and christine are saying<br>as well is that<br>we are all working in transdisciplinary<br>areas and<br>we're all trying to break silos<br>disciplinary<br>silos and all the work that we have been<br>talking about and the examples we've<br>been giving<br>involve engineering design innovation<br>and entrepreneurship<br>so yeah that's what um is exciting about<br>um education for the future at the<br>university of auckland because we're<br>trying to break silos and be<br>transdisciplinary yeah and i i would<br>just<br>i totally agree with you carla as well<br>and i think what's great about the<br>university and i guess christine might<br>touch on this later on is<br>that's why it's so great we've got<br>programs like velocity<br>and the unleashed space really bringing<br>students from sort of all areas and<br>staff really<br>uh to come together and and really help<br>tackle some of those issues and<br>and and explore some of those<br>opportunities as you said<br>now carl i'm just going to move on to<br>your next question<br>which is really um considering a health<br>and well-being perspective<br>how can teaching and research in the<br>field of design help address some of the<br>challenges we're facing in today's world<br>yes thanks for the question and then i<br>also see that in the q and a<br>window there's a question related to<br>that so i guess i'll be answering both<br>questions<br>uh okay yeah so<br>um designing terms of health<br>and well-being designed for health and<br>well-being<br>it's kind of an area that it's really<br>interesting and it's the area that i'm<br>particularly<br>that's kind of the area that i try to<br>practice in<br>because um i'll give two examples of how<br>design can be<br>applied to health and well-being so one<br>of the research projects that i<br>know really well it's from our uh head<br>of design associate<br>professor deb posen and she had<br>developed this<br>um vr gogo game<br>for young people that have to go to<br>hospital for<br>um long-term treatment so<br>by talking to parents of children that<br>go to hospital<br>that was able to identify that a lot of<br>children feel very lonely when they're<br>in hospital because they have to be<br>removed from their communities or from<br>their schools<br>and they are sitting in this room by<br>themselves so this vr<br>technology and the game that she has<br>created it's actually an<br>opportunity for kids to play it with<br>each other while they're in hospital so<br>basically<br>once they have um the viergo go on what<br>happens is they see<br>uh their hospital bed transforming into<br>a boat<br>and they see the room filling up with<br>water and then they start to see other<br>boats<br>on the horizon which are the other<br>children that are in that<br>same hospital and basically they can<br>communicate through this virtual<br>um environment this immersive by virtual<br>world<br>where they out of sunday they're not<br>alone anymore and they're not in a<br>hospital<br>and that's really interesting and that's<br>really cool because that's how<br>technology can also help uh with<br>the overall well-being not only the<br>physical well-being but also the<br>mental health and spiritual health and<br>all<br>aspects involving health and well-being<br>but also<br>um design can thinking i can think about<br>changing some of the processes<br>and uh procedures that happen in a<br>hospital that don't necessarily involve<br>new technology<br>so just by changing some of the steps<br>in the journey or in the experience of<br>patients<br>patients in hospital diagnose time can<br>be reduced<br>the quality of the work environment for<br>nurses and doctors can be improved<br>so it's also we work in we try to look<br>into<br>um systematic approaches and also<br>think about all the stakeholders<br>involved um<br>in the in the context that we're working<br>with and try to make sure<br>everyone benefits for from it so it's<br>not only about<br>the end user so we use that word a lot<br>in design so it's not only about the<br>patient or the end user<br>it's also about the healthcare workers<br>and the carers the families and everyone<br>involved<br>in that context oh that's absolutely<br>wonderful<br>and uh that's so nice for those children<br>who as you said you know<br>highlighting that particular case um you<br>know that it must be so daunting for<br>someone<br>you know on their own in hospital uh<br>just as an adult let alone being a child<br>as well and so that vr sounds absolutely<br>wonderful<br>yeah yeah it's a wonderful project that<br>my colleague<br>and associate professor that polson has<br>worked on and every time she tells the<br>story<br>people kind of start getting a little<br>bit more about what we can do in design<br>and its relationships to health and<br>well-being<br>i'll have to drop by at some point and<br>try on the vr<br>goggles as well that would be wonderful<br>thank you<br>okay well thank you so much carla so i'm<br>just now gonna move on to uh questions<br>for uh christine<br>so um chris you've been involved in<br>entrepreneurship and education for many<br>many years and you're instrumental in<br>the establishment of<br>um sorry i've got i've gone on to the<br>wrong question my apologies let me just<br>go back<br>um so looking at the sustainable<br>development goal<br>uh which is target 8.3 it talks about<br>the promotion<br>and development orientated policies that<br>support productive activities<br>entrepreneurship innovation uh the<br>growth of micro small and medium-sized<br>enterprises now based on your research<br>and work with smes and family businesses<br>and social<br>enterprises as as you've mentioned<br>previously in new zealand<br>what are the key challenges we face in<br>achieving this target<br>such as sdg target 8.3<br>yeah so this challenge of of i guess<br>growing<br>businesses um and growing businesses in<br>new zealand<br>and i think one of the challenges is<br>that for these<br>owner-managed businesses which is the<br>situation with micro small and<br>medium-sized businesses<br>is that they often mistake motion for<br>progress<br>so what do i mean by that so that's that<br>idea of you know kind of<br>we're going we're going really fast but<br>actually we're not really getting<br>anywhere<br>um and so a challenge is what do we say<br>no to<br>what do these owner managers what do<br>these entrepreneurs<br>say no to because they often have 101<br>different ideas<br>but not all ideas are viable<br>opportunities<br>and then you've got to sustainably grow<br>the business so i guess<br>part of what we're doing and i know the<br>work that carl is doing as well is<br>is to enable to provide<br>tools and frameworks to help<br>these businesses say no to things so<br>that they're then<br>saying yes to the right things so i<br>think<br>that challenge of working smart not<br>necessarily working hard<br>um and i i hope that makes sense and for<br>those of you watching<br>who have parents who are you know own or<br>run small or medium-sized businesses<br>have family businesses<br>indeed you might be working in um small<br>and medium-sized businesses you kind of<br>know what i'm talking about<br>it's this real challenge of mistaking<br>motion for progress<br>yeah i think that's a really good point<br>and that actually reminds me of a story<br>it's called um<br>who moved my cheese yeah yeah um<br>and so yeah i totally agree um i i have<br>parents as well who started uh small<br>businesses and that's definitely<br>very very crucial um so just looking at<br>um the next question which uh you'll<br>have to forgive me<br>i was straight in there on this question<br>so you've been involved in uh<br>entrepreneurship and education for many<br>many years and you were instrumental in<br>the establishment of velocity which is<br>something we discussed at the beginning<br>and what's great is you know i'm sure<br>you'll talk about that soon about you<br>know how<br>lots of students can be part of that<br>program but how important<br>you know is that program in in sort of<br>sparking that entrepreneurial spirit and<br>mindset<br>amongst our students and even some of<br>our staff yeah<br>it's a good point around students and<br>staff and that's been one of the<br>um i think one of the successes of of<br>velocity<br>and i think many students come already<br>with an entrepreneurial mindset<br>so i think there was a question around<br>what can i<br>do at the university of auckland if i've<br>got a business idea can i<br>spend time at the university will people<br>help me<br>and this is exactly where velocity comes<br>in so<br>because it's open to all students and<br>all staff across the university<br>it means that there's there's various<br>different events there's very<br>various different challenges where you<br>can take your idea<br>and you can explore that idea and see if<br>it is a viable opportunity and you get<br>feedback from people who are experienced<br>business people<br>experienced academics working in this<br>space<br>angel investors venture capital so that<br>they can help you<br>kind of take that idea and sometimes the<br>idea is just not viable<br>but that means if you say no to that<br>idea there'll be a number of other ideas<br>that you can then spend<br>time on and look to see if they're<br>viable opportunities i think the other<br>thing<br>and um bruce talked about kind of<br>commercialization experts<br>so what we have is some amazing research<br>like bruce's research across the<br>university so<br>velocity offers an opportunity for<br>students and staff working together<br>to then look at what the commercial<br>opportunities are<br>and we've had some amazing successes<br>from great research that's been<br>occurring in our university and saying<br>now<br>what are the what is the the commercial<br>potential of that<br>and who in our ecosystem can come<br>together to help that<br>and velocity has been a really important<br>part of that<br>of that story oh that's amazing um<br>and uh christine i wondered if it would<br>be possible to maybe i don't know if<br>you've got any examples<br>um as you said there um just to<br>highlight you know one at one of those<br>yeah um a number of years ago there was<br>a<br>there is a company called power by proxy<br>um and it's<br>excuse me i am not an engineer but my<br>really<br>basic understanding is it takes power<br>from here to there but there's no cord<br>in between<br>inductive power transfer thank you<br>that's a much better way of of<br>talking about it so you know an amazing<br>um professor in in that area built up<br>you know kind of research capability and<br>in different other academics working and<br>then<br>young engineering students coming<br>through and that's been<br>you know built and grown and been a<br>really really successful<br>business and that's just one of one of<br>many so again coming back to the points<br>that were raised earlier<br>we can we can bring this business<br>know-how um<br>and combine that whether it's in science<br>whether it's in medicine whether it's in<br>robotics whether it's in other aspects<br>of engineering<br>whether it's in arts music dance<br>whatever it is and it's it's the both<br>end it's bringing those things um<br>those things together um so it's yeah<br>great<br>and it's really exciting it makes you<br>really proud to work at the university i<br>guess<br>yeah totally i totally agree and every<br>time i've gone past<br>some of the seen some of the velocity<br>events or seen some of the<br>unleashed space events it really does<br>look fascinating and i think it's such a<br>wonderful opportunity for students and<br>as you said staff as well to really<br>explore<br>um those ideas now<br>i guess that leads us on really to our<br>last question and then we will go to<br>some of the questions that have been<br>sent to us by<br>um our attendees today and that's really<br>just looking at you know<br>we've talked a lot about uh you know<br>climate change<br>and uh innovation for small and<br>medium-sized businesses<br>as well as design and i guess some of<br>the concerns that people have in society<br>is with<br>change uh some people can lose out<br>and in this case you know if we are<br>utilizing technology and automation<br>in for example bruce in terms of uh<br>fruit picking<br>uh or in factories like companies like<br>ocado for example in the uk<br>um you know will that lead to the loss<br>of the jobs and<br>and if so what will be the jobs of the<br>future and carla i think<br>you said in the beginning um i i you'll<br>have to repeat that it was 65 percent of<br>students<br>those jobs are not yet developed yet<br>they're not actually there<br>which is quite scary but also very<br>exciting as you highlighted so<br>we'll start with uh bruce if maybe you<br>can just talk about<br>you know what would be the jobs of the<br>future and are robots taking our jobs<br>thanks uh ryan actually i don't think i<br>do not think<br>robots will take all our jobs away and<br>there's very little evidence to support<br>that<br>idea most of the more detailed analyses<br>have come up with a different conclusion<br>and um<br>i i i don't know how to whether people<br>can see the<br>the chat but i can post a link to um<br>a link to a video that you should watch<br>actually<br>it's a video on uh a website called free<br>free think<br>it says will robots take out jobs<br>and the conclusion is that they won't oh<br>that's good<br>as long as as long as they don't take<br>over as well well that's that's<br>that's that you know there's not much<br>evidence for that either<br>oh good the link in the chat that's what<br>you see on the videos and the movies<br>and that's what people worry about i<br>think the jobs that will be created<br>will be there'll be a lot of tech jobs<br>because<br>people have to create those robots they<br>have to program the robots and<br>often there's a lot of work to set a<br>robot up in a new<br>task so the commissioning of the robot<br>if you like<br>programming it to do the new task<br>connecting all the sensors<br>and making sure it does the task<br>properly and refining it<br>at the moment there's a lot of work for<br>machine learning experts<br>to train a robot to understand the<br>objects that it needs to develop and so<br>on<br>brilliant i suppose that machine<br>learning would probably fall into<br>would you say software engineering and<br>maybe data science<br>uh yeah it does we think it's all part<br>of robotics but<br>it does robotics here it is also used in<br>those areas<br>and a lot of people call it ai even<br>though it's not really ai<br>yeah and there'll be there'll be jobs<br>also to<br>make the robot you know bolt the bits<br>together<br>make the parts to do the machinery<br>and the welding painting so there's a<br>lot of construction work<br>and there will be jobs maintaining those<br>robots<br>like if you have robots in a meat<br>processing plant<br>you'll need instead of the electrician<br>you'll need the robot engineer to<br>make sure all of that stuff is working<br>properly and up to<br>you know the performance that it should<br>be and i suppose touching on that uh<br>bruce that's<br>why the university has developed a<br>masters in robotics and automation which<br>will be available to students<br>um in in 2021 and 2022 so<br>that's definitely something to check out<br>for all of our attendees if that is<br>something of interest<br>um to definitely go onto our website and<br>check that out um so just leading on<br>from you bruce um<br>carla i wonder if you could uh just<br>touch on this question as well<br>yes sure and my perspective about<br>automation and technology is that if<br>automation and robots are gonna<br>take some of the repetitive jobs and<br>will<br>workload for humans then that is an<br>opportunity<br>for us to focus on jobs<br>and work that where we can align what we<br>care about<br>with what we do i think we're<br>transitioning from<br>a scenario where people have jobs<br>because they need to pay<br>rent they need to buy food and they need<br>to support a family<br>to i think the future jobs and i can't<br>tell you exactly what the future of jobs<br>is going to be like but what i imagine<br>because of the opportunities that<br>technology and automation present<br>is that we'll be able to merge our<br>interests and our passions with our work<br>because if we can get the robots to do<br>the the work that we don't want to do<br>then we can actually focus on on things<br>like<br>um if you like if you are passionate<br>about making a change for climate change<br>if you want to tackle that<br>problem you can actually try to combine<br>that<br>with what you're going to be doing 40<br>hours a week<br>as your full-time job so i think to me<br>automation is not scary at all because<br>to me auto<br>automation is an opportunity to focus on<br>purposeful and rewarding<br>work in the future that sounds fantastic<br>and i totally agree back in the day um i<br>worked in a<br>uh in a ceramics factory actually um so<br>if there was a robot doing that and i<br>was concentrating on something else i'm<br>sure i'd much rather do that<br>in design there's also um the other<br>creative component<br>of um jobs as well which is<br>very particular to human beings as well<br>so uh it's something to consider<br>and our masters of design is actually<br>structured in a way that students can<br>actually bring their personal interests<br>into the university<br>and we can support them in developing<br>those<br>interests so the whole structure of<br>both coursework masters and research<br>masters is planned in a way for students<br>to get mentorship and to get support and<br>resources<br>to work on their areas of interest<br>no that's that's perfect um christine i<br>wonder if you could<br>add to the discussion here as well well<br>actually<br>i don't think i will be adding to it<br>because as he quite rightly pointed out<br>i've been working for many many years<br>and i actually think it's those people<br>that are watching us<br>you know as as the people coming to our<br>universities<br>who have great ideas um you're going to<br>be the ones<br>that are going to be thinking up the the<br>op you know the opportunities the<br>social enterprises the things that will<br>impact climate change the business<br>opportunities you'll be creating the<br>jobs<br>and we'll just be there to hopefully<br>help guide and provide frameworks and<br>different ways of thinking<br>and challenging you um but you're going<br>to be the ones that are going to be<br>doing it<br>no pressure no but<br>but what an amazing opportunity i think<br>that's<br>one of the things i really enjoy about<br>these conversations is i find out<br>you know a lot more about what our<br>university is doing and i think<br>what comes through from that is<br>opportunities amazing opportunities<br>totally agree um so we're just going to<br>move i'm conscious of time<br>and i realize we have gone slightly over<br>time so i believe<br>um our panelists today you have been<br>great in answering some of those<br>questions as we have gone along<br>but what i would just like to do is um<br>before we do wrap<br>up just for anyone to ask<br>any final questions in the chat box<br>function and we'll do our best to answer<br>those<br>um<br>i'm just looking at some of the<br>questions now so<br>how many how can older generations adapt<br>to this job in scenario change so<br>some of these questions i believe we<br>have answered in in<br>in one way um i just see a question<br>that's coming here i believe that<br>problems in<br>automation of jobs is that older<br>generations have had only known<br>that type of job so it's a good point so<br>we're talking about jobs of the future<br>essentially and i guess<br>um our rule here is essentially saying<br>well<br>if these new jobs are coming how are we<br>going to help train those people and i<br>suppose<br>that really falls into you know what<br>role can universities play<br>um in obviously helping to train people<br>to adapt to change<br>as carla as bruce and as christine has<br>said but i don't know if<br>um bruce or or or carla or christine if<br>you<br>if there's anything you'd like to add<br>there yeah go on bruce<br>uh yeah i think that's a really good<br>question<br>because while um overall when automation<br>happens normally more jobs are created<br>and there's more people employed in<br>the world today than they ever were at<br>any time<br>in history there are those people that<br>are doing a job that have been doing it<br>for a long time<br>who can be displaced for a while so we<br>need that<br>retraining program we have to take it<br>seriously<br>it's part of what goes it goes back to<br>what christine said about<br>you know equity and poverty we need to<br>make sure that<br>we maintain good enviro good potential<br>for all of those people to have good<br>jobs<br>so you know that like the masters in<br>robotics for example is<br>also not it's not just about training<br>young people it's about<br>retraining people who are already in in<br>some kind of job and they want to up<br>skill<br>and i think government should fund that<br>kind of free training and companies<br>should support it and you know help<br>their workers<br>take that new step because really it's<br>the it's the people that you want to<br>keep<br>and if you can retrain them you can you<br>can retain their<br>commitment to the company yeah i agree<br>and<br>i guess christina with the current<br>situation and pandemic and it's you know<br>really forcing companies to adapt and<br>change<br>extremely quickly and governments across<br>the world are really struggling with<br>lockdowns and obviously economy<br>shrinking and gdp shrinking and<br>obviously recessions happening so<br>you know what role do you think<br>governments and and businesses should<br>play just<br>you know addressing some of the points<br>that bruce have made in relation to<br>retraining<br>i i mean i would love to see that<br>support<br>coming through from from the government<br>um and<br>and i say government because that's<br>obviously it's taxpayers money<br>and you know taxpayers we as a community<br>in terms of supporting others in that<br>community and<br>and i think one of the things is this<br>idea of lifelong learning<br>and i know it's a very easy phrase it<br>trips off the tongue<br>but it is something that we do have to<br>have to think about<br>that we are going to all constantly you<br>know and obviously<br>we work at a university we love learning<br>that's that's why we're there<br>um so we need to be supporting and<br>changing the<br>the headspace um and the learning<br>kind of um focus for even for new<br>graduates you know you you've completed<br>a bachelor's degree<br>but then what are the opportunities with<br>the masters the master's programs that<br>carla and bruce have talked about<br>um and and so i think it is incredibly<br>important that we as a community<br>encourage our governments to support<br>that kind of<br>um retraining upskilling training in new<br>areas<br>yeah and i guess it's an investment as<br>well i mean we should hopefully you know<br>pay not a cost<br>yes not a cost totally totally agree um<br>carla i'm going to just move on to<br>another question which has just come in<br>and i think this would be<br>a great one for you um to answer and<br>and that's from one of our attendees<br>today has really just said<br>they obviously work with high school<br>students and essentially before high<br>school students come to university<br>they're wondering are there any<br>particular subjects or any soft skills<br>students should look to work at before<br>they come to university<br>and i wonder if if you had anything to<br>add to that collar<br>yes definitely i think that<br>high schools prepare students really<br>well<br>in terms of learning how to work in<br>groups and working with each other<br>and i think some of the soft skills that<br>are really important in a university<br>environment are<br>communication collaboration and also<br>i think it's important for people to<br>know about themselves in the areas of<br>interest<br>so a lot of the work we do locally with<br>high schools is that<br>we go out to schools and we ask students<br>what are the things that you care about<br>what are the technologies that excite<br>you what are the<br>so what are the global challenges that<br>worry you so i think once<br>um high school students kind of<br>understand the things that they like<br>they care about<br>they can definitely look at universities<br>and try to find<br>um a course that is going to support<br>that so<br>we're saying design for example if you<br>like to play video games come study<br>design<br>because we actually think that some of<br>the<br>skills and some of the hobbies and some<br>of the things that young people like to<br>do<br>can actually be developed and turn into<br>a<br>career and um yeah so<br>those are the things i think are really<br>important knowing a lot about<br>who you are what you want to do what you<br>care about but also learning how to work<br>with others<br>learning how to collaborate and and<br>learn how to<br>um not basically try to be excited about<br>the future and motivated about<br>the potential changes that you can make<br>that's perfect<br>um so i've just conscious time so i am<br>going to try and uh<br>wrap um wrap up today's session but just<br>one thing to add as well to your points<br>there carla and i think that's totally<br>spot on in terms of developing and<br>helping students really select that<br>subject here that they're going to<br>pursue for the next three to four years<br>you'd hate to get it wrong so i totally<br>agree in pursuing things that you enjoy<br>and you're interested in but i guess the<br>other great thing about coming to<br>university<br>is the fact that we will help students<br>develop those soft skills that they<br>might be lacking<br>and that will be in addition to<br>obviously the programs that they do<br>choose to study and i think<br>that's one of the great things about the<br>university of auckland you know things<br>such as velocity<br>unleash but also the student support and<br>development teams that we do have they<br>do play a massive role<br>in helping our students with their soft<br>skills as well okay well<br>um i think uh for us today we're gonna<br>finish there but i do just want to say a<br>massive thank you to<br>everybody who's joined us through from<br>throughout the world we really<br>appreciate you taking the time to stick<br>with us and i<br>i do apologize that we have gone over um<br>if you do want to find out more<br>information about the university of<br>auckland we do have<br>we are on social media and again we have<br>our facebook twitter<br>linkedin and we do also have a page on<br>sustainability which i highly<br>implore you to go and check out as well<br>so you can see what we're doing at the<br>university and some of the amazing<br>research we're doing to address<br>some of those key sustainable<br>development goals so please do<br>go and have a look i also just want to<br>highlight that we do have<br>exemplar panelists lecturers and<br>professors from all of these fantastic<br>faculties such as engineering school of<br>design and the graduate school of<br>management so please do<br>check out these vr codes and we will<br>send you links after today so you can<br>look at<br>the specific programs available um in<br>these areas<br>but apart from that i do just want to<br>take a moment just to thank our<br>panelists<br>carla bruce and christine thank you so<br>much for joining us today<br>it's been an absolute pleasure talking<br>with you and uh<br>i'm sure you're looking forward to<br>seeing hopefully some of our attendees<br>who will be joining us at the university<br>at some point in the near future but<br>thank you so much to everyone<br>and uh again all the best<br>take care keep well stay safe and uh we<br>look forward to hopefully seeing you<br>in ayatura in auckland very very soon</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
