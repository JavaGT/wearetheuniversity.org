In a Government funded project on the Horowhenua in Aotearoa New Zealand, Penny Allan, Huhana Smith and Martin Bryant, accompanied by iwi and hapu from the Kuku Community north of Wellington, considered a future that embodies Māori knowledge, the science of climate change, ecological thinking and the practices of design and art. Their project, in ancestral lands that are subject to destruction by current dairy farming practices and future climate change impacts, has been the subject of a number of publications and exhibitions. In this discussion they will expand on the potential for aligning methodologies to enhance the resilience of the land and its people.<br><br>Bios<br>Penny Allan is Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney. Her three most recent design research projects MOVED to Design, Earthquake Cities of the Pacific Rim, and Rae ki te Rae, deal with the relationship between environment, culture, resilience and design and have all received national awards.<br><br>Huhana Smith (Ngāti Tukorehe, Ngāti Raukawa ki Te Tonga) is an artist and academic with wide-ranging experience in Māori visual art and museum practice, exhibition planning and implementation, indigenous knowledge and science research. She is currently Head of Whiti o Rehua | School of Art, Toirauwhārangi | College of Creative Arts, at Massey University, Wellington<br><br>Martin Bryant is a Professor of Landscape Architecture at UTS and a practising landscape architect, architect and urban designer. His globally significant research led to his authorship of urban ecology and resilience policy paper for United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito in 2017.<br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims at bringing together practitioners, scholars, students and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field.

their lecture titled weaving<br>methodologies<br>explores how we might interweave<br>different knowledge systems without<br>losing their distinctiveness<br>in a government-funded project on a<br>horofenue in ottawa new zealand<br>penny joanne and martin accompanied by<br>iway or the local maori tribes from the<br>community north of wellington consider a<br>future that embodies maori knowledge<br>the science of climate change ecological<br>thinking<br>and the practices of design and art<br>their projects in ancestral lands that<br>are subject to destruction by current<br>dairy farming practices and future<br>climate change impacts<br>has been the subject of a number of<br>publications and exhibitions<br>in this discussion they will expand on<br>the potential for aligning methodologies<br>to enhance the resilience of the land in<br>its people<br>just some very brief housekeeping rules<br>do not forget that our speakers will be<br>sharing their screen so keep this window<br>open<br>i would also ask you to remind me to<br>throw to talk<br>and there will be plenty of time at the<br>end for<br>questions either you can ask those<br>verbally or you can just type them<br>in a chat box without further due please<br>join me in giving a warm welcome all the<br>way from sydney australia to canyon<br>martin<br>and to hirano from our beautiful capital<br>here<br>good morning everybody and what i'll<br>just begin with today<br>and i acknowledge my esteemed colleagues<br>penny and martin<br>who we've had lots of fun together over<br>many years<br>and but what we're going to do today is<br>just really<br>bring you to an understanding of how<br>we've woven different knowledge systems<br>without losing their distinctiveness and<br>in particular<br>we are expanding on the potential for<br>aligning methodologies that<br>might enhance the climate change<br>resilience of land and its peoples<br>and in particular through my pepiha i<br>talked about the peoples and the hapu of<br>our our region<br>in cuckoo we are a um a southwest<br>coastal region north of wellington<br>in our talk we will also consider a<br>future that embodies our knowledge of<br>place<br>in my pepihar i gave you a whole run<br>through from mountains to sea<br>from our mountains mountains right<br>through to the water<br>that follows all the waterways and i<br>named each one of them<br>but we consider that maori knowledge<br>with the science of climate change<br>and we think we bring ecological<br>thinking into that space and also the<br>practices of<br>design and art particularly through<br>landscape architecture and<br>particularly through contemporary art<br>practice both indigenous and<br>non-indigenous art practices<br>so today we'll talk about those maori<br>methodologies that are particular to the<br>place of cuckoo<br>and how penny and martin and i have<br>worked together<br>as landscape architects as artists as<br>as women um well women martin uh<br>as also maori women who we've worked<br>with and i include my cousins moira<br>potama<br>and my cousin aruha spins so with all of<br>us together we've done<br>um we've worked very hard together to<br>try and make changes in these spaces<br>so if i just go forward again i'll<br>discuss more the maori methodologies<br>i'll describe why landscape architecture<br>provided a good synergy for us to work<br>together penny<br>will reflect on the issues associated<br>with landscape architects working with<br>maori culture and other cultures and<br>compare some of the outputs from our<br>exhibitions<br>and within the um mb funded project that<br>we've done<br>martin will also expand upon that but<br>how we've worked with erie and hapu from<br>cuckoo<br>and we've worked with martin manning a<br>climate scientist and a river<br>geomorphologist jane richardson<br>and how we've woven those things<br>together so martin will help us<br>take us through the geological history<br>of the site and um<br>etc etc so um for us today<br>this is uh my nine minutes<br>and press the stopwatch now<br>so what i talk about and what i gave you<br>in that pepihar was an encapsulation of<br>whakapapa<br>and whakapapa is a maori term that<br>encompa which is a<br>a term that is a genealogical reference<br>system<br>which brings everything together people<br>plants land<br>water mountains seas brings everything<br>together<br>so that whenever we are working in<br>projects this way we consider<br>a interconnected and interrelated um<br>ways of working so we must acknowledge<br>that<br>whole system of understanding so<br>whakapapa is like a philosophical and<br>ultimately<br>a very mighty imbued understanding of<br>how people see themselves<br>embraced by and within and related to<br>the natural environment so that was<br>extremely important for<br>with penny and martin coming to work<br>with us that we all<br>understood that um intrinsic<br>relationships between everything<br>the other method that we would use was a<br>method called hikoi which is a walking<br>talking<br>method that we perfected and we began<br>this process through the manaki<br>tahamawana research project which<br>started in 2010<br>and what we tried to do was when we were<br>bringing a lot of disparate<br>groups of people together to work with<br>aoe and hapu<br>the best way that we could actually get<br>to know each other<br>and get to understand each other was to<br>walk the fenua or to walk the case study<br>that we were dealing with<br>so we um during the course of manaki<br>taha moana we did something like 26<br>walks and those walks began with our<br>original core team of water scientists<br>hydrologists<br>archaeo seismologists we had<br>representatives from department of<br>conservation we had<br>horizons regional council district<br>council etc etc<br>bringing a group of disparate people to<br>walk together on maori land a mighty<br>coastal land<br>in order to understand where we were all<br>coming from<br>and it became a method that was<br>perfected through the<br>the way that penny martin and i worked<br>together for manakita moana when the<br>landscape architecture students came on<br>board<br>um led by penny um through the fourth<br>year paper at victoria university about<br>land<br>about fenua and we perfected that hikoi<br>methodology<br>of walking and talking the fennel with<br>our students and with our<br>specialists coming in to a maori um<br>kaupapa<br>so it worked really well and hikoi is<br>something we continue to use today<br>so we used it for manakita moana from<br>2011 to 2014<br>and then when penny and martin joined us<br>still for the climate change research<br>2015 2017<br>and we're still using that methodology<br>today<br>the other method that we talked about<br>was<br>um so when we're walking and talking<br>fenua<br>we're also relaying the the knowledge of<br>place and the stories of place and the<br>way<br>that i've been um raised by my elders<br>and who many of them<br>most of the people i've dealt with have<br>passed away now<br>and but when we walked and talked that<br>phenomena with them many many years ago<br>they would i would just retell their<br>stories of place<br>and that was really important for<br>everyone to get a strong<br>groundedness in cuckoo to understand<br>what they were walking on and understand<br>that there was so many um<br>deeply cultural relationships to that<br>fenua<br>so stories that are passed on<br>by ancestors all those who have gone<br>before us were critical<br>for um helping us with this project<br>um so as i said i'll just recap<br>whakapapa into relationships um<br>interconnectedness between everything as<br>a<br>as a a cultural and a philosophical<br>precept in which to work<br>hikoi the walking talking hui<br>which were critical to the students<br>understanding and to<br>all of our participants understanding<br>and correct<br>the oral narratives of place that helped<br>us understand where we were coming from<br>um so what landscape architects brought<br>to that picture<br>was the ability to harness the<br>complexity of what we were dealing with<br>so when we're talking about the impact<br>on<br>of dairy farming on coastal maori land<br>holdings<br>we have our people have gone into a<br>economic base which is actually taking<br>away our cultural and our ecological and<br>our natural relationship with place<br>we are being severed from place because<br>of pollution<br>non-point source pollution pollution<br>water pollution and now we<br>are impacted further by um<br>what's happening with the activities of<br>climate change<br>so landscape architects and penny and<br>martin will talk to this at greater<br>depth<br>um and clarity landscape architects<br>brought<br>that whole visual system of design<br>into the projects in order to help our<br>people<br>see new opportunities for the fenua that<br>we are<br>responsible for as kaitiaki as guardians<br>but also how we could re-kindle and<br>re-and connect those relationships with<br>place<br>and actually start turning around the<br>issues<br>of water health and turning around the<br>issues<br>of finding new economic bases for a<br>country that is becoming exceedingly wet<br>when martin starts or penny starts on<br>they'll start the visuals<br>and that will help you understand more<br>so too<br>and just in my last moment contemporary<br>art is also really important to this<br>process so<br>through the course of this research<br>which has been um intensely undertaken<br>since 2010<br>is that i bring the contemporary art<br>practice in so there is a group called<br>nuku drawing ecologies group which penny<br>and martin are a part of<br>and that we have international and<br>national artists involved we have<br>indigenous and non-indigenous artists<br>involved<br>and that we are all working on various<br>projects currently<br>um to help turn around some of these<br>issues that we face both with water<br>quality<br>and with climate change impacts i'll<br>leave it there<br>and and we'll allow martin to explain<br>further and to dovetail into what i've<br>thanks everyone<br>i know lots of these names that i've<br>seen in front of you so it's really nice<br>to<br>know you're there in some sense even<br>though they're just black boxes at the<br>moment so it's really nice to be here<br>with you and thank you very much bruno<br>for inviting us and of course thank you<br>of course to huhana who was very<br>generous in inviting penny and me<br>into this project which we've enjoyed as<br>she says for a number of years<br>i'm just going to share a screen because<br>being a landscape architect i like to do<br>pictures um<br>and so there is this is<br>this is a power point here but it's<br>it's a little bit um um<br>i'm just going to flick between a few of<br>the images and then we will start to<br>talk to a few of the images<br>so it won't necessarily be in<br>that one there so here you can all see<br>that<br>this this is um my interpretation<br>or our interpretation maybe from a<br>landscape architect's point of view of<br>what<br>huhana just talked about about the the<br>three<br>maori methodologies which we were<br>introduced to which<br>uh which huhana introduced us to<br>one was the whakapapa the way in which<br>it uh<br>we were grounded we felt part of the<br>earth<br>the hikoi was those dots that you see<br>across this image here<br>that was our journey across the<br>landscape where we stopped and told<br>stories and drew pictures<br>of what we saw and started to understand<br>the situations and being embodied in the<br>situations and cells<br>and the korero was about<br>um communicating that and that was the<br>the oral narratives which was the<br>traditional<br>maori method and there are<br>maybe some similarities between how we<br>operate as ecologists and landscape<br>architects but<br>the with these with these methods we<br>like to feel<br>landscape markets like to feel grounded<br>and they like to feel situated<br>and we also like to communicate in ways<br>that are different from<br>textual based research papers etc<br>so these methods methodologies resonated<br>a little bit but it was<br>you know the fascinating thing for us<br>was being involved<br>in this particular site and with<br>indigenous people<br>so we could compare not just the<br>similarities but also the differences<br>and we could start to see how we<br>we looked at them and talked about them<br>and that was what was incredibly<br>productive about this whole project<br>about<br>how how we could relate to those um<br>these methodologies and how we could use<br>them and interpret them in different<br>ways so<br>this kind of drawing as johanna says was<br>a<br>type of drawing that start to to<br>create the synergies between us there's<br>another drawing<br>here where we were which is about how we<br>brought everything together on on this<br>project and<br>on the one hand on the left hand side we<br>had science and we had<br>climate change science so we had martin<br>manning and jane richardson giving us<br>geomorphological and fluvial<br>ecological uh science and we had<br>ecological eco<br>economists but we had to create um a<br>bridge<br>and the research that we developed what<br>came about<br>through drawing and through designing<br>and so we developed in the middle here a<br>series of<br>designs i suppose that we developed but<br>the designs themselves weren't enough<br>because and i think penny will explain<br>this just doing designs in a traditional<br>landscape<br>architectural way wasn't enough to<br>really start to bring the two things<br>together we needed to start to work out<br>how we can uh catalyze things to<br>happen so the the drawing was a way in<br>which to<br>start that so<br>yes do you want to make it on full<br>screen the<br>slideshow<br>sorry uh you know just hit the one on<br>the left the little<br>yeah that's great okay i kept it over<br>there because i did have<br>a couple images which i'll flick back to<br>but um<br>let me a lot of people in the audience<br>are new zealand they will<br>know this landscape very well uh this is<br>absolutely stunning landscape so mostly<br>for<br>our international people just so that<br>they can see what's happening here<br>here you see the amazing tararua ranges<br>in the background they're the spine that<br>runs down new zealand that's the<br>fault line between the australian plate<br>and the pacific plate<br>which lifts up folds up and created this<br>amazing mountain range<br>running north south you can see the long<br>north south ridges<br>across there and over time<br>as it eroded it brought sediment<br>down towards the sea which you see at<br>the bottom<br>there and as the sediment brought came<br>towards the sea<br>um it got laid down on this big alluvial<br>plain that you see and it's this is the<br>ancestral lands which huhana<br>is talking about this is a pretty um<br>uh dramatic country here there's huge<br>winds which blow across the whole world<br>the roaring forties come across here so<br>as the sediment comes down it gets<br>deposited<br>as it meets the sea the the sediment<br>gets deposited then the winds pick up<br>the sediment and blow it back<br>and form a series of front dunes which<br>you can see across the<br>front through here and then this amazing<br>thing happens in this landscape<br>where some of the dunes actually get<br>blown out because the winds are so<br>severe<br>and they start pushing the dunes back<br>into the countryside so<br>these here are these parabolic dunes<br>they create these parabolic shapes which<br>are really amazing<br>all through this landscape and they're<br>five six seven meters high so they're<br>really dominant pieces of the landscape<br>and you don't see them so far<br>inland but you see them in this zone<br>between about<br>about a kilometer in in from the on the<br>from the coast and it that's what makes<br>it a pretty amazing landscape and<br>meanwhile the rivers are all bringing<br>all this water from the<br>the mountains which get a lot of rain<br>and they bring them down here this area<br>was all wetland<br>once 200 years ago before europeans<br>settled through here it was all wetlands<br>through here<br>gradually over time it all got filled in<br>and drained<br>so that the rivers were all channelized<br>and even to the point where<br>some of the beautiful anna branches of<br>the river which you see this<br>big looping the oho loop we call through<br>here<br>actually has been cut off by human<br>devices unfortunately so that the river<br>is more efficient to run down to the<br>water etcetera and yet the river keeps<br>on wanting to do<br>things like wobble left and right<br>because it's got forces coming<br>in from the sea and the force of the the<br>water coming down from the<br>from the hills so in this context that's<br>where<br>you get this this landscape which is<br>um on the one hand incredibly resilient<br>but in<br>also incredibly vulnerable too because<br>when its natural ecosystems get<br>destroyed<br>it loses its resilience and yet it's<br>built up a resilience over<br>over hundreds of thousands of years<br>millions of years perhaps<br>and the ability of us to as landscape<br>architects and<br>the maori community to start to think<br>about this landscape is something we can<br>regenerate in a way that makes it more<br>resilient brings back more of the<br>resilience<br>was what we were looking towards in here<br>so in the process of doing this and i'm<br>going to now just<br>flip a little bit forward there's<br>another map of this beautiful<br>countryside a lot of this countryside<br>has been<br>suburbanized you can see that on the<br>right hand side but you get these<br>amazing tracks which are<br>still held by in maori ownership and so<br>the maori ownership um allowed us to<br>start to look at<br>value sorry i'm just showing you this<br>this is the map of new zealand you can<br>see<br>where where we are here in the bind of<br>taranaki<br>the south island used to once he's stuck<br>onto<br>a bit of north island there um pretty<br>amazing<br>landscape through here and here you see<br>the mountain ranges through here and<br>this is little bits of settlement<br>that have occurred through here and<br>we're somewhere<br>up in here no we're not we're somewhere<br>down in here aren't we<br>um yeah just north of otakiyat we were<br>somewhere in there that might be<br>through there and you can see that all<br>the towns have just developed along the<br>highway the highway got developed along<br>the edge of the the mountain range<br>through there and then these threads of<br>road came out to the beaches but also<br>the rivers are all trying to get down to<br>the beaches here and as i said these<br>these areas were all con connected once<br>by um by wetlands<br>um i'm just going to flick down to<br>to this last slide here<br>up because this was<br>at the same time we were thinking about<br>this as a piece of landscape we were<br>also<br>talking with huhana and her<br>hapu and community about what what they<br>wanted<br>there and so a series of values started<br>to emerge<br>i think it's better if you talk about<br>these who hana<br>um<br>um this is literally bringing families<br>back to the phenomena this is a dream<br>to actually um have our people living on<br>ancestral land so<br>the the notion of bringing um quality<br>sustainable<br>uh well-designed homes back to fenua<br>this is a dream we're going to make it<br>happen so penny and martin keep working<br>um making sure that the farm is<br>economically viable so when we talk<br>about pure waitanga that's the flowering<br>that's the kind of<br>everything that you do to create that<br>flower uh that pure waitanga<br>um is what we're trying to do is making<br>our farm<br>work really well for future and that<br>sustainable economics and um<br>and alternatives and regenerative<br>agriculture etc<br>um it's that's returning our<br>natural customary fisheries back to<br>river systems and so particularly in our<br>area we were famous for inanga or white<br>bait<br>and famous for our tuna or our eel and<br>we're trying to replenish<br>and revitalize and refresh our waterways<br>so that we can receive these um<br>these uh traditional resources back into<br>our fenua<br>back into our uh these are what are also<br>called<br>species these are species that are<br>treasured by maori so we're trying to<br>is all about guardianship and um<br>ultimate environmental protection for<br>the future generation so we must protect<br>the farm for future generations<br>and we're going through these processes<br>at the moment like<br>slowly slowly slowly changing the way<br>our farming governance is functioning so<br>it's<br>far better and slowly slowly changing um<br>our practices on on fenua and and<br>our what we're doing with our fenua and<br>we're making<br>inroads but it's taking a it's probably<br>taking a lot<br>it's a lot slower than what i would like<br>is all about our younger generations<br>coming to help<br>um and protect our farm and our coastal<br>um<br>our coastal ancestral land for future<br>generations<br>when martin was talking about the<br>parabolic dunes and talking about all<br>the area<br>laced throughout that area of places of<br>great significance where<br>our tupuna are buried um where there's<br>been battle sites<br>so these are areas as wahidupuna or<br>wahitapu like sacred grounds these are<br>the things that we want to<br>acknowledge know where they are and<br>protect these ancestral ancestral<br>sites and burial areas so while we may<br>have these other economic aspects going<br>on with dairy farming and<br>forestry and tree planting we've also<br>had<br>a lot of wetland restoration work going<br>along i've run a lot of riparian<br>planting going along<br>a lot of new ideas for where we're going<br>to go for climate change<br>but ultimately it is to protect the<br>ancestral<br>um as our most important sites within<br>that fener that<br>martin showed you from mountains to sea<br>thanks and just i'll just go back to<br>this one because this is where<br>we as landscape architects came into it<br>we<br>started to prepare a series of drawings<br>the drawings we did were to help the<br>local community understand<br>the potential of their place what they<br>might be able to do there<br>so this is traditional landscape<br>architectural work we<br>provided pred quite detailed schemes<br>about<br>what would happen now and later this<br>this is part of an exhibition that you<br>see here but a series of drawings which<br>you all know as landscape architects of<br>the<br>visualizing and speculating on what the<br>futures might be<br>how the wetlands might be re uh<br>reinvigorated regenerated and how people<br>could live here<br>and inhabit the place just as in<br>accordance with those<br>kinds of principles that um<br>that huha just talked about then and<br>then there's a drawing like this which<br>it captures that amazing landscape which<br>i started off with<br>that idea here's the mountains and<br>here's the sea and it's something that's<br>uh that attracted us right from the<br>start<br>to the project and uh it says a series<br>of<br>moves that make you one makes in various<br>places so<br>some of them are about building building<br>houses<br>settlements on the high ground where the<br>high part of the<br>dunes and diversifying the agriculture<br>so that<br>the current dairy farming which is a<br>monoculture that basically dominates the<br>place and is kind of ruining all the<br>waterways polluting the waterways etc<br>can can be diversified to protecting the<br>dunes<br>creating new wetlands and<br>you know protecting the more arable land<br>where the land is most fertile<br>so this process was about not just<br>informing the maori community but also<br>being able to inform the world about<br>what these possibilities are so these<br>kinds of drawings were things which we<br>then used in our publications but<br>we had this problem that we that<br>surfaced which was you know how do we<br>catalyze people to do<br>something and so uh we<br>ran a series of exhibitions but i'll let<br>penny talk about the exhibitions<br>now but the exhibitions were a way in<br>which we could get people to<br>think about them and also we started to<br>develop tactics<br>saying when when people might do things<br>so i'll hand over to penny now to<br>talk about those um exhibitions<br>thanks um martin i'm not actually really<br>going to talk about the exhibitions that<br>much<br>but i want to talk about more the the<br>way<br>we operated together because i think<br>i think these kinds of insights are<br>really interesting and these<br>insights emerge quite slowly these<br>aren't things that we came into the<br>project knowing i think these are the<br>things that evolved as<br>as we as we move through the project and<br>we have been working together for a<br>number of years then<br>in fact the work that we've done with<br>juhana is a little bit inflected with<br>the earthquake work that martin and i<br>did<br>some years ago so i'll talk about that<br>as well but so i'm really<br>i'm really just wrapping up and i'm<br>giving reflections and<br>so the first the first is the nature of<br>the relationship between<br>maori and pakiha there's a number of<br>different ways of looking at how these<br>kinds of collaborations might play out<br>um and certainly the situation is very<br>different from culture to culture and<br>country to country<br>so i want to talk here about how our own<br>relationships<br>evolved anne salmond who's a new<br>zealander<br>who writes very beautifully and and<br>wrote interestingly about the<br>wanganui river she talks about a weaving<br>of<br>world views or perspectives but she says<br>it's incredibly difficult to achieve and<br>huhana and i'm speaking for huhana now<br>sorry johanna<br>i think tell me if i'm wrong she thinks<br>of it as a maori embracing or holding<br>the other<br>and that's an extremely generous way of<br>looking at it but we've also juana and i<br>have also discussed a slightly different<br>model<br>and when we first started working<br>together i was inspired by mason durie's<br>cons<br>mason juries concept of the tikkana<br>house<br>he drew a little diagram that described<br>how mari and pakiha<br>might work together in parliament rather<br>than maori being subsumed by a colonial<br>institution a world view<br>he drew three houses one for pakeha one<br>for maori and then a third space<br>the tikunga house neither one nor the<br>other is a third space<br>where both cultures were able to come<br>together from a position of strength<br>and in a reciprocal relationship of<br>respect and trust<br>so in our own working relationship we<br>set up this third space by developing a<br>protocol together<br>to guide all interactions it was quite a<br>short document<br>but it covered the way we would engage<br>with each other<br>it created a virtual third space which<br>goes some way towards addressing the<br>issues around cultural<br>cultural appropriation which is i guess<br>one of the biggest challenges when you<br>have two different cultures working<br>together<br>so it creates a safe space in which all<br>parties can experiment and hopefully<br>innovate<br>now methodologies are the bedrock of any<br>world view or knowledge system but<br>more than that they reflect the<br>culture's values<br>so it's impossible to appropriate<br>appropriate and other cultures<br>methodologies in anything but an<br>incredibly<br>superficial way we see that in the<br>clumsy way that symbols or patterns or<br>architectural markers<br>are sometimes used to signify as the<br>culture<br>so rather than borrow from each other we<br>look for alignments between our<br>different methodologies for example<br>whakapapa refers to layering and the<br>connection between all things<br>and there are similarities between this<br>kind of thinking and ecological thinking<br>or hikoi is about walking and talking in<br>landscape<br>and there are interesting parallels<br>between hikoi and western tradition<br>traditions of walking practice they're<br>aligned but they're not exactly the same<br>and for collaborative relationships we<br>found it's actually the differences<br>between these methodologies that matter<br>because the differences are what enrich<br>and expand<br>the world view of our own culture for<br>example when we were curating the<br>whakapapa shed for the dairy exhibition<br>then<br>i'll talk about that now and martin if<br>you want to you might want to put<br>put up that slide of alex in the<br>about the shed<br>um johanna said the about the shed<br>should be first so we've got this<br>uh dairy farm and these three amazing<br>abandoned dairy sheds<br>which we spent days cleaning all the<br> out of<br>and you know they they're just so<br>beautiful sitting there in the landscape<br>by the river<br>and each one of those johanna suggested<br>each one of the three should represent<br>one of the methodologies that we worked<br>with<br>and the oral narratives um who honestly<br>the whakapapa shed should be first<br>because it's the foundation and because<br>it's grounding and<br>that was the first time i heard huhana<br>talk about papa from a perspective of<br>grounding<br>i always knew it was about connectivity<br>but i didn't realize it was about<br>grounding<br>now there's not really any parallel with<br>grounding in ecology<br>where embodiment and grounding in<br>large-scale systems matter<br>but perhaps they should be and certainly<br>that's been<br>the recent focus of some of my own<br>research<br>that relationship between the data<br>of ecological systems big landscapes<br>landscape urbanism and that<br>that being connected to what's on the<br>ground<br>and the second point is just an<br>elaboration of<br>application amplification or elaboration<br>of this martin do you want to put up the<br>and i'm just so i'm just using a<br>specific example here<br>so it relates to two diagrams we made at<br>the beginning of the work to communicate<br>climate change and climate phenomena<br>so martin and i were interested in<br>representing in this in this diagram<br>here<br>which martin has up um actually martin<br>could you this is the exhibition<br>so this is the exhibition go back march<br>yeah this is the exhibition it was the<br>um window finder school of architecture<br>in the back where there were two<br>exhibitions<br>and each one lasted for a couple of<br>months<br>uh in the back you can't quite see it<br>there's a beautiful photograph that<br>martin manning the climate scientist<br>took of the cuckoo river of the river<br>mouth<br>and it it's so amazing because it kind<br>of shimmers<br>with its presence then over that on the<br>glass we were overlaying<br>kind of different perspectives or ways<br>of seeing that landscape<br>you know what kind of more abstracted<br>relationships could<br>draw out um the importance of that<br>landscape<br>martin could you move to the next slide<br>this the graph<br>so this is the first one um so<br>um<br>so so martin and i were interested in<br>representing the rhythms of change<br>over vast scales of time from the<br>lunatides to the ice ages<br>and we wanted to show how these rhythms<br>sometimes overlapped and amplified one<br>another<br>magnifying impacts huhanas was quite<br>different<br>martin can you show the marumataka<br>covers a period of the lunar month it's<br>a circle marked by<br>every phase of the cycle<br>next to it are markings which document<br>not only the phase of the moon but also<br>the tides<br>and the way these influence the<br>abundance or otherwise of aquatic life<br>but even more interesting is that each<br>marking also contains an indication of<br>where<br>and how one might fish in incredible<br>detail<br>from a boat on the shore with a line<br>with a sphere etc<br>the knowledge this knowledge was<br>originally not written down but passed<br>down through stories and only recorded<br>the way you see here<br>late last century and it reminds me<br>this maharataka reminds me of whose<br>story<br>when she spoke to students at the<br>national museum shortly after we first<br>met<br>pointing to a pastoral scene with a<br>river running through it she began<br>talking about<br>how it was so much more than the image<br>she described how the local ewing knew<br>that if they heard a lot of scurrying<br>and scratching near the river<br>it meant that there was a flood coming<br>it was lizards<br>scarring to get a scurrying on the rocks<br>to get the high ground<br>so what's interesting then about the<br>difference between these two<br>diagrams is the marumataka records<br>clusters of phenomena that relate to a<br>particular place<br>it's grounded and importantly it<br>connects those phenomena<br>to actions or responses by either<br>lizards or people<br>it's a narrative around if and then<br>which records a rich set of<br>relationships and events<br>so if and then is really how we set up<br>he went on to set<br>up the whole project if this happens if<br>you notice this<br>then this is what you need to do<br>the graph is quite different for a start<br>although temporal it's relatively linear<br>it's completely abstract and it offers<br>no clue about how one one might respond<br>to environmental phenomena or<br>disturbance<br>it's relatively empty of information in<br>that regard<br>so how could you use that knowledge<br>that's embedded in the<br>tucker to think about a similar<br>narrative that could evolve over time<br>around climate change on this part of<br>the coast unlike the maramataka this<br>kind of environmental flux is relatively<br>unpredictable knowing what might happen<br>but not when<br>put quite puts quite a bit of emphasis<br>on the capacity of locals to notice<br>subtle changes in the landscape<br>and to adapt autonomously over time<br>in small incremental responses so our<br>work was kind of preparing the ground<br>supporting the noticing and providing<br>the tools<br>rather than doing anything dramatic so<br>i'll pass back to huhana now and<br>thank you martin and i think if we just<br>um consider how important it's been<br>to work together like this and how<br>important it has been<br>for all this work that we did and<br>particularly that intense work we did<br>um between 2010 and 2017<br>is that that was the basis in which<br>we've launched into<br>three phases of climate change research<br>so<br>we are at that point now where we have<br>with penny and martin we did adaptation<br>strategies in the toolbox<br>with phase two we did risk assessments<br>and um<br>all of these reports can be found on the<br>deep south national science challenge<br>website<br>and also if you're interested in just<br>what penny martin and i have talked<br>about today it is all encapsulated in<br>the reports that you will find on the<br>deep south<br>national science challenge vision<br>page please have a look at those<br>adaptation strategy and the risk<br>assessments<br>but the third project is the<br>implementation so we're starting to now<br>work with another group of people<br>um a freshwater ecologist and a climate<br>change modeler<br>who's helping us and as penny said also<br>determining<br>well not determining because there's so<br>much uncertainty there's so much unknown<br>and and he explaining that the climate<br>change model explaining that<br>and then how we um bring that together<br>with um<br>tangible actions that iran hapu can<br>engage in<br>which is um what we what we're looking<br>to develop<br>is is sedimentation trains which are<br>like<br>shallow pools that will be dug back into<br>paddocks by the ohio river<br>in order to enable tides and time<br>and regrassing um or resedging or<br>re-reading<br>these places so that our tallest species<br>have somewhere<br>more to live and that it's not a paddock<br>for um<br>for cattle the the sea the tides the<br>time is also telling us that things are<br>changing on the farm so<br>it is a consolidation of much of this<br>research<br>to help us make the best informed<br>decisions and take the best actions<br>to start despite the uncertainty or the<br>unpredictability of what we face<br>but i think for ewe and hapu to engage<br>in projects like this we must<br>act and we must use our hands and get<br>involved<br>in projects so last thursday and friday<br>we just had another one<br>and we are moving towards creating um<br>designing<br>resilient ponding systems or<br>sedimentation trains which are a series<br>of<br>round um not unlike the mata mataka not<br>unlike putting you know circle<br>uh work within our fenua we'll make sure<br>they look very artistic and very um<br>very attractive but um we are working<br>with artists with designers to help us<br>place that resilience back within our<br>whenua<br>um<br>um penny martin and i have finished for<br>thank you so much for listening to us<br>and we will take any questions<br>that you might want to ask thank you the<br>three of you for this amazing<br>presentation<br>it's very inspiring to see um how can<br>you bring all these different<br>methodologies and knowledge together<br>um as johannes said it's time for<br>questions<br>um you can either ask them directly and<br>don't forget to unmute yourself<br>or if you feel a little shy you can type<br>your question and we can just read it<br>out loud<br>we have one question from yvonne<br>uh that emailed me just uh some seconds<br>ago<br>uh and the question is where can you<br>find information on a whakapapa shared<br>exhibition posters is there anywhere you<br>can find this information<br>um i think i mentioned it before all of<br>the reports<br>and everything about the exhibitions<br>because i think penny martin and i<br>perfected the methodology about<br>exhibitions as research method<br>they can be found on the deep south<br>national science challenge<br>website if you go to vision<br>and then look down i mean i can even<br>find it for you and i can share the link<br>and i think that's what we should do and<br>i think that<br>i think there's also a couple i don't<br>think i know there's some research<br>papers that we've had published between<br>the three of us<br>that also give a more in-depth uh<br>reflection on what we've been doing and<br>why<br>it's we think it's important i've got a<br>list<br>of um references which i will send to<br>bruno<br>and then i can share amongst the<br>listeners so i hope that helps even<br>thank you any questions from our<br>participants<br>hi uh kia ora penny marlson and huhana<br>corey here hi corey um<br>i've just had a question i guess um<br>working in practice um we come across<br>tiara<br>tiaring and matrix quite a lot and i<br>guess it's<br>particularly up in auckland that's<br>embedded into the nz dialect and<br>a lot of how we start out working in<br>practice but having worked in<br>queenstown more recently we've had to<br>start to unpack that particularly for<br>naitahu and<br>the values that are particular to them i<br>was just wondering<br>um obviously for this project you guys<br>have started<br>right back at the early methodology and<br>starting from the ground up<br>and wellington is that how much<br>weight does tiaranga have in that sort<br>of space or is it something that<br>really needs to be project by project<br>um i can't answer um corey because i<br>i have i've been out of new zealand for<br>a while but maybe bruno<br>um might be able to comment on that<br>from the position of the landscape<br>architecture discipline<br>um well i think corey the<br>the tehranga design principles are used<br>a lot especially<br>in at universities as a reference<br>as as as a way as a non-statutory<br>document that brings together um maori<br>ways of thinking and doing into into<br>landscape<br>architecture um i'm not particularly<br>aware<br>especially at the council level here in<br>wellington um<br>that they they refer to it but i<br>don't think they are following it<br>religiously<br>i think it's interesting what you say<br>corey that you need things in queenstown<br>are quite different<br>so in what way are they different are<br>you finding<br>um well there's a lot of similarities in<br>crossover like some of the um<br>core tiaranga principles are reused but<br>with a knight<br>who spin on them yeah but i guess it's<br>even from like the way that project<br>managers get engaged in<br>the cultural side of the space of the<br>project<br>i think they like to see that<br>methodology<br>kind of quite tightly wrapped up at the<br>start but it's introducing space for<br>this sort of methodology<br>to be built in a project yeah i think is<br>important<br>and we're getting but it's kind of we're<br>working with a group<br>okaha who are based in dunedin and<br>after doing one project then a second<br>project you start to build<br>how that might work a little bit better<br>um yeah<br>i think the the interesting thing i mean<br>frameworks are really important<br>particularly if there's never been<br>frameworks before but<br>frameworks tend to be dangerous because<br>they you know they can be followed<br>blindly<br>and as you know we've all discovered um<br>every place is different every culture<br>is different even<br>every sub um sub ewe group or<br>what whatever in a country will be<br>different and i'm finding in australia<br>it's a completely different environment<br>and each time i<br>i start to work with um indigenous<br>people i<br>i need to start from scratch i think<br>that's<br>that's the way you need to do it but<br>it's not i mean it's not just another<br>culture it's<br>it's another discipline i mean i'm<br>finding that this um<br>this way of thinking um covers all sorts<br>of different collaborations and<br>and and how one might develop frameworks<br>you know that are site-specific<br>culture-specific discipline specific<br>um so that you can work together more<br>productively<br>corey if i could add to that too thanks<br>penny um<br>is that like from a kaitaku perspective<br>or and as penny was saying<br>i firmly believe that we were doing what<br>we needed to do for our fenua according<br>to our core<br>so it wasn't following i'm aware of the<br>of the<br>the framework you're talking about of<br>course penny and martin we you know we<br>had to be<br>uh aligned with that and also meeting<br>lots of other maori<br>whether you're an urban planner or<br>whether you're an architect or<br>whatever people using those principles<br>but when you're working on hapu fenua<br>it's different<br>everywhere you go because the stories of<br>place are different and the genera<br>the observations of place are different<br>and the and the<br>environment is different so you work<br>with that difference all the time<br>but i think the thing for us was about<br>it's always about<br>it's always about that hapu of that<br>place<br>determining from base how they want<br>things to be<br>and then it was just through this<br>process of collaborating and bringing<br>people into that space<br>it was vitally important for anyone who<br>comes into our space you know penny<br>martin included<br>that they took um cognizance of that you<br>were standing on maori land and that<br>this maori land was going to tell you<br>how it was going to be<br>yeah and that's really what we were<br>inculcating ourselves on<br>in order to help accelerate some of the<br>things and the changes that we needed to<br>make<br>on that fener because there had been so<br>much um<br>maybe more recent recent damage to the<br>phenomenon like within the last 40 years<br>um with rivers being cut off for flood<br>protection<br>but mainly for farmers upstream more so<br>than the maori farmers on on that area<br>even though<br>it created a productive farm it also<br>began the ecological decline<br>so everything we have to do has to come<br>from that<br>um from my perspective an expression of<br>self-determination<br>thank you um any other questions from<br>i think everyone's kind of a little shy<br>um<br>i think looking at the work the three of<br>you are doing and looking at the<br>profession of landscape architecture<br>what would you like to see that<br>currently is not existing in a<br>profession<br>i'll say something um for me and it goes<br>back to the research that i'm<br>that i'm working on at the moment it um<br>it's not<br>so much collaboration and how to<br>collaborate<br>from the from the perspective of the<br>landscape architecture<br>it's how to deal with these large<br>landscapes<br>in a more qualitative way so not<br>simply relying on gis data and staying<br>distant<br>but actually developing more qualitative<br>methods<br>that can inform the way<br>we relate to landscapes in a grounded<br>way<br>uh because this is what we haven't been<br>doing<br>in the world and this is what's<br>destroying the world<br>and the closer and more connected we we<br>feel with landscape<br>the the more likely it is we are to care<br>for it and i think that's<br>slightly different answer but similar<br>but but different<br>i think what what's amazing about this<br>project is<br>that it teaches landscape architects the<br>idea of the importance<br>of the ground up process in other words<br>looking at the local looking at the<br>particular<br>as the starting point as landscape<br>arctics we often get the broad scale<br>map even i fell and fall into the trap<br>because i show the big picture of<br>the the big landscape and talk from the<br>broad scale down to the detail<br>and yet this project taught us how to<br>actually start from the detail look at<br>the local things look<br>and then start to piece everything<br>together to get a picture of the broad<br>scale<br>and that iterative relationship between<br>scales<br>is something that sometimes we as<br>landscape arctics lose because we get<br>sucked into the gis and the broad scale<br>and this<br>this this project was a um you know<br>a great way of just showing the value of<br>looking at<br>the detail and the local and the<br>techniques which huha taught us were<br>amazing in being able to refocus on that<br>aspect of the landscape<br>as if that part of the land will<br>actually teach us what's happening in<br>in the bigger and bigger scale rather<br>than the big going down<br>i think it's important to like just<br>picking up on what penny and martin are<br>saying as well<br>is that um when we started all this<br>research even back in 1996 when we<br>initially started all of this kind of<br>how to overturn the waterway decline<br>issues that we were facing was that we<br>you know promulgated a tea kanga or a<br>method and<br>where all of our people who might come<br>to help us<br>had to come through the mud eyes so all<br>of our researchers are welcomed onto the<br>marae<br>via porfiri so buy a maori tikanga<br>process so that they<br>become embodied embedded in place<br>through the mud eye and then out through<br>the dining room and then out onto the<br>fenway because no one can just go out<br>onto the fenner and start working<br>you have to come so that that lovely<br>loop that we have to do<br>is it's not it's not like a it's it's<br>it's the right way to do it<br>so there's only one way to do it and<br>it's to come what comes through the mud<br>eye and be grounded and<br>the the the histories in the corridor of<br>our<br>place um through our ancestral meeting<br>house and then through our dining room<br>and then out onto the phenomena<br>and that we just keep doing that kind of<br>approach<br>and so that when everyone is out on the<br>fenway they are safe<br>they are well um they are working<br>productively<br>and and i just we penny martin and i<br>we've had such fun doing this over the<br>years<br>we feel like we really have hit on<br>something that actually works<br>to get so much complexity<br>transferred across to people who need to<br>know it<br>in a much more accessible and a much<br>more<br>um and in a close way<br>and i think um i i cannot thank them<br>enough for being part of that um<br>of opening up their landscape<br>architecture visual systems to why<br>maybe an artist might see things and<br>then the way that we are bringing<br>now more artists into this space so<br>please watch this space there will be<br>more<br>exhibitions as a research method there<br>will be more maybe<br>these major site events um on the fenway<br>so we'll have penny and martin
