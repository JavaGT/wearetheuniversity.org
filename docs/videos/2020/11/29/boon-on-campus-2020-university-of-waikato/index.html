font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>(smooth relaxing music)<br>- Boon on Campus has been pretty cool.<br>- Highlight so far is just the good vibes.<br>- Yeah, meeting the other<br>artists and having conversations<br>with people from the university.<br>- The stories and the<br>connections, hopefully,<br>will be shared among many.<br>(bright electronic music)<br>(spray hissing)<br>- Special part of my painting<br>is this waka huia that she'll be holding<br>and the image is taken<br>from one of the taonga<br>in the School of Music.<br>They have an extensive<br>collection of taonga puoro,<br>of Māori musical instruments.<br>This piece actually represents<br>a receptacle of knowledge,<br>just as the university is,<br>and students come here to gain knowledge<br>and then what they do<br>with that is up to them.<br>- This painting, the taniwha, represents<br>the transformation,<br>embracing your Māoritanga,<br>your taha Māori for the first time.<br>Some people who are just<br>learning te Reo Māori,<br>going the study the language,<br>going to trace their whakapapa.<br>They're really embracing<br>their Māori culture<br>for the first time,<br>and this talks about that transformation.<br>Similar to myself, but also talking about<br>other people who are learning<br>they're Tainui for the first time,<br>who are learning that they're from<br>Ngāpuhi for the first time.<br>I'm really interested in that process<br>and this is what that<br>painting talks about.<br>And it's not a easy process in some cases.<br>Some people are real shy,<br>some people are real embarrassed<br>about not knowing where they're from.<br>Some people embrace it happily<br>and all of these different<br>pathways that people take,<br>I'm on my own pathway, too.<br>- This artwork responds to a whakataukī,<br>and the whakataukī is<br>"Kia whakatōmuri te haere whakamua"<br>And what that means is,<br>"I walk backwards into the future<br>"with my eyes on the past."<br>It really resonates with me now,<br>this idea that we bring our past with us.<br>And then I also got really interested in,<br>you know, what's the long<br>history of this space?<br>So, going right back to when it,<br>before it was the university,<br>and it would have been<br>forests full of kahikatea<br>and tawa and stuff like that.<br>So, that's what this one's about.<br>- The concept for this work<br>is exploring a form of communication<br>that was observed by our<br>tīpuna, our ancestors.<br>And it's a cyclical communication<br>occurring between Mother<br>Earth, so Papatūānuku,<br>and Ranginui, the Sky Father.<br>So Papatūānuku releases moisture,<br>and that's met by Rangi,<br>who releases moisture,<br>water from the heavens.<br>So it's this cyclical, ongoing<br>fluid form of communication.<br>And so I'm trying to reflect<br>that through the blue hues,<br>and then also I'm bringing<br>in customary patterns,<br>poutama and kaokao, that reinforce<br>concepts around whakapapa, so, genealogy.<br>It's been a lot of fun<br>and specially collaborating<br>with Jeremy Shirley<br>who's assisting me with<br>this very challenging work.<br>Because of its height,<br>we're having to work with a cherry picker.<br>It's 23 metres high,<br>and he's a very skilled<br>operator on the cherry picker.<br>So I feel very safe in his hands<br>as he gets us into the<br>position to apply the paint.<br>- So, the manu in this piece signifies<br>that manu that came down<br>with the kete mātauranga.<br>As Tāne was descending from the heavens<br>with the Baskets of Knowledge,<br>this bird followed him<br>and it made a nest here on this puke<br>where the university is at the moment.<br>Over time, it realised that<br>it was feeling hungry, tired,<br>all these new emotions that<br>it had never felt before,<br>so it started to believe that,<br>"If I stay here any longer, I might die."<br>He returned back to the heavens.<br>Before he left, he wanted<br>to gift a handful of people<br>its gift of knowledge as well.<br>In the picture here, you<br>see a portrait of a wāhine.<br>She is getting all the<br>knowledge downloaded into her<br>at the moment in the piece.<br>She's just gazing into<br>the korokoro of the manu,<br>which is the throat,<br>and she was the next in<br>line to share the knowledge.<br>My favourite part of this piece,<br>even though it was the most<br>painful part, was the hair.<br>Each strand of the hair<br>was brutal. (laughs)<br>So yeah, it took me a whole<br>entire day just to do the hair<br>and make sure that the hair was right.<br>When the students do return back to here,<br>they're gonna notice<br>that there's a few walls,<br>that's got a colour thrown up on it<br>and hopefully it inspires them<br>to do whatever they<br>wanna do in their lives.<br>(bright electronic music)</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
