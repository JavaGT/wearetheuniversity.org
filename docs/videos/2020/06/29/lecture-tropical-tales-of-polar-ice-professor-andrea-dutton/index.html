Lee for making<br>this lecture series possible I would<br>like to thank Rob Makai for inviting me<br>to to give this lecture this year and<br>his predecessor the earlier director of<br>the Antarctic Research Center who<br>invited me a few years ago and I said<br>can I take a rain check I'm hoping to<br>come for longer and so I also would like<br>to thank Fulbright New Zealand for<br>making that possible and for sponsoring<br>my trip out here to spend more time with<br>the couple a colleague's here at<br>Victoria University<br>so this evening I'm going to spin you<br>some tails to tell you how the tropics<br>are related to polar ice sheets and I<br>often joke with my colleagues here that<br>while they're being intrepid explorers<br>going down to the ice that I get to go<br>gallivanting around tropical islands to<br>learn something about the Antarctic Ice<br>Sheet<br>because we can see the signal of sea<br>level rise as the Antarctic ice sheet<br>melts in the tropics and so to kick<br>things off I'm actually going to<br>introduce you to myself into my work<br>with a quick two-minute video that gives<br>you a sense of what it is that I do as a<br>field geologist and it will also give<br>you a sense of why what I do is<br>sometimes people think of the work I do<br>is trying to save the planet I'm not<br>really concerned about the planet I'm a<br>geologist and the planet has been here<br>about four and a half billion years the<br>planets gonna survive sea level rise<br>still going to be here the question is<br>though how are we going to survive and<br>one of the things we need to know in<br>order to prepare is how quickly is this<br>process going to unfold and one way we<br>can answer that question is by looking<br>at Earth's past<br>because to some extent third has done<br>this experiment for us before we're<br>looking at this by studying fossil coral<br>reefs corals grow near the sea surface<br>because they need the sunlight to<br>survive and so we use them to track the<br>position of sea level in hats<br>coming to the University Florida was a<br>really natural choice for me it's a<br>collaborative environment within<br>departments within the college between<br>different colleges in the university and<br>all those things have a great appeal<br>we're building an incredible depth of<br>knowledge about what's happening to our<br>planet and one of the things that we can<br>do is use this information to help us to<br>create a new future a future that we<br>want to be a part of<br>all right so um I should have mentioned<br>also it wasn't mentioned in my<br>introduction that the last nine years<br>I've been at the University of Florida<br>in case we picked up on that so they<br>made that as a promotional video but<br>it's it really a quite nice explanation<br>of of what I do and it's a nice way for<br>you to get to see the work that I do as<br>a field geologist give you a little bit<br>of background on how that works so this<br>is the world that we are now living in<br>today and in your program if you had a<br>chance to look at it it says human<br>experience is shaped and sometimes<br>forever altered by the extremes we<br>experience in our lifetimes and we are<br>now living through an era of rapid<br>global warming that brings with it new<br>extremes that impact our lives and our<br>livelihoods in a myriad of ways and I<br>used to say that one of the most visual<br>impacts of that climate change the<br>sea-level rise but you can actually see<br>the inundation it's very hard for people<br>to understand it's very abstract when<br>you talk about two degrees of warming<br>well what if that note changed by 10<br>degrees today<br>whereas sea-level is very visual but now<br>we have these images from wildfires such<br>as this one here from earlier this year<br>in Australia which are perhaps even more<br>striking and profound the one on the<br>right if you haven't seen this one<br>before<br>and can't see it quite in the picture in<br>the middle here there's a big white<br>octopus sitting in the middle of this<br>parking garage that was photographed in<br>Miami Beach during a normal high tide<br>this was not a storm surge it's kind of<br>king tides season normal high tide so<br>you have to ask yourself you know what<br>plate are we going to realize it this is<br>not white right maybe humans shouldn't<br>be occupying this space that the ocean<br>is taking back over and the reason that<br>all of this is happening is displayed at<br>the top of the screen here now these<br>color stripes that maybe many of you<br>have seen before called global warming<br>stripes actually show the temperature<br>change on a color scale from the late<br>1800s to present day and you can see<br>it's a very striking visual image of how<br>rapidly we have been warming our planet<br>and when you look back over your<br>lifetime or the lifetime of your parents<br>or your<br>you realize how that really cannot be<br>used as a baseline for what is happening<br>today at all and that is an important<br>perspective for us to keep in mind but<br>when you hear stories about sea-level<br>rise they're often accompanied with<br>pictures images like this of ice sheets<br>polar bears and it gives you the<br>impression the false impression that<br>this is a distant problem and it's far<br>away and it doesn't really affect us<br>because you know who's gonna go to the<br>NRF Ice Sheet well I say that but there<br>are several people in the audience who<br>have of course but I find it's more<br>effective and to convey the real reason<br>why this issue is important is because<br>of the way it will affect our lives as<br>we know it and so in telling this story<br>we really need to put humans literally<br>into the picture and so this is perhaps<br>more visually striking image and what is<br>shown here are at four people who are<br>standing in water at a depth that it's<br>going to reach within their lifetimes at<br>the place where they live so these are<br>four different locations in the US that<br>they've considered for this particular<br>image and this really hits home a little<br>bit more doesn't it than looking at a<br>picture of a big white ice sheet this is<br>why we are worried about the issue of<br>sea level rise that is already happening<br>today so the real question is then to<br>pose to US scientists as well how<br>quickly is this going to happen if we're<br>going to plan for this to adapt we need<br>to understand how quickly this process<br>is going to play out<br>now that's challenging because we've<br>never lived through a climate that's<br>warmer than today and so we haven't<br>experienced that we don't know we don't<br>understand all the physics of the<br>retreat of these ice sheets to tell you<br>exactly how quickly that process will<br>happen and so that's where my job comes<br>into play and as a geologist we can look<br>back at time as I as I explained in the<br>video and look at examples of past warm<br>climates to try to understand when the<br>earth warmed before how quickly did<br>those ice sheets retreat and how<br>sensitive were they to the warming how<br>much did they retreat or were they not<br>really affected by the amount of<br>that we're expecting so those are the<br>types of questions that we can ask as<br>geologists to help us to better plan for<br>the future so today I'm going to take<br>you back in time to the time period that<br>I've been working on that is known as<br>the last interglacial which is denoted<br>here by the pink arrow so you're looking<br>at a graph of sea-level on the vertical<br>axis that goes back in time and these<br>are thousands of years so hundred one<br>hundred thousand two hundred thousand<br>and so forth and you can see there are<br>these natural cycles that occur about<br>every hundred thousand years in sea<br>level and those correspond to changes in<br>temperature and ice volume so as the ice<br>sheets melt sea level goes up and as the<br>ice sheets grow sea level goes down so<br>if we go back in time from today this is<br>the last glacial period about 20,000<br>years ago or we had large ice sheets in<br>the northern hemisphere and then before<br>that there was a warm period back here<br>which we creatively called the last<br>interglacial it's between the glacial<br>periods right so that's where that name<br>comes from so I was reflecting on this<br>last week when I was giving a talk to<br>some of my colleagues here that more<br>than 50 years ago now there is this<br>fellow named John Mercer who published a<br>paper in a rather obscure little journal<br>and is about Antarctic ice during this<br>time period the last interglacial here<br>it's referred to as the Sangamon period<br>he found evidence of sediments in<br>Antarctica that indicated that summer<br>temperatures were some seven to ten<br>degrees Celsius higher than today at<br>some point during the Pleistocene you<br>know the Pleistocene is more than two<br>million years long so it's notoriously<br>difficult to date sediments in<br>Antarctica so all he could say is well<br>sometime in this time period we think<br>that perhaps the West Antarctic Ice<br>Sheet collapsed and we had open water<br>here with these warm summer temperatures<br>and that would have risen sea level by<br>about 4 to 6 meters and he said while<br>there's evidence from the last<br>interglacial that sea level was higher<br>so perhaps that's when this happened and<br>so he put forward this hypothesis more<br>than 50 years ago<br>and so I think it's an appropriate point<br>in time for us to now take stock and<br>what have we learned in the<br>50 years what can we say was he right<br>and what have we learned about the<br>Antarctic Ice Sheet in the intervening<br>time a whole heck of a lot is what I can<br>tell you so on the left side of this<br>image is the very first composite<br>satellite image that was put together<br>for Antarctica back in 1964 the image on<br>the right side of the screen though is<br>an image of three different datasets<br>modern data sets that are superimposed<br>upon each other<br>there's the topography data set the DM<br>that you can kind of see in the 3d<br>shading there's the sea ice extent which<br>shows the sea ice extent for a<br>particular day in mid-may several years<br>ago now and the colors that are plotted<br>over the continent show you the amount<br>of warming over about a 50-year period<br>that has occurred over the Antarctic<br>comment from a data set that they've<br>analyzed over that time period you can<br>get daily updates of satellite images<br>from Antarctica now so it's really<br>profound a data explosion that we've had<br>over this time period and at the same<br>time we've also been on the ground and<br>in the ocean trying to learn what we can<br>about the ice sheet and the land beneath<br>it and the oceans and the marine<br>sediments that border the continent that<br>can also tell us something about what's<br>happening on the Antarctic continent but<br>it is very difficult to do field work in<br>that region and there are only a few<br>places where we've punched holes into<br>the ice sheets or that we've penetrated<br>to beneath and so we do rely a lot of<br>times on these airborne datasets that in<br>a way can fill in some of the picture<br>and interpolate in between a bit better<br>so over this time period Antarctica has<br>been melting and more recently that melt<br>rate has accelerated this graph shows<br>you on the vertical axis sea level rise<br>in millimeters and time from 1993 over<br>almost to present-day<br>this is a satellite dataset only goes<br>back to 1993 because that's when these<br>missions started to plot it that way and<br>over this time period the average rate<br>of ride is is only about three<br>millimeters a year sounds awfully small<br>and you may wonder why are these<br>scientists so worked up about three<br>millimeters a year and it has to do with<br>a couple things one is that it's been<br>rising for<br>grrrrrr than this and I'm going to show<br>you the pot over the last century in<br>just a moment but also that we've been<br>building infrastructure right on the<br>edges of our coastlines and there is no<br>capacity for us once we and we're<br>starting to tip over the edge in many<br>places that are getting more frequent<br>coastal flooding so when we put this in<br>context of the last century this they're<br>only about four graphs in this talk I<br>can you've seen three of them already so<br>don't worry it's not going to be a<br>talkative greps<br>so here's the vertical axis again in<br>millimeters and calendar year from 1900<br>to about 2010 I believe so this shows<br>you the record that we have from tide<br>gauges note I gave just were first<br>installed to measure the tides not to<br>measure sea level rise it turns out how<br>they sat there and seas went up they<br>became an excellent recorder of what was<br>happening with sea level rise there are<br>three different lines on this graph<br>that's because there were three<br>different research groups that analyzed<br>the same data set in different ways like<br>it's been a whole hour talking about<br>that but fortunately you haven't come to<br>that talk today you don't have to worry<br>about those details as you go back in<br>time the lines tend to diverge because<br>there are not very many tide gauge<br>records that go back that far so it<br>becomes harder to interpolate what the<br>global average is but regardless of<br>which line you look at sea level is<br>clearly been rising by about 20<br>centimeters into this time period and<br>it's been accelerating again regardless<br>of which of those curves you look at and<br>the dominant contributors to that sea<br>level rise signal are the thermal<br>expansion of the water as it heats up<br>and it expands and the melting of<br>mountain glaciers now at the same time<br>Greenland and Antarctica were melting as<br>well but they were not the dominant<br>reason for that signal in the 20th<br>century more recently the melt rate from<br>the polar regions has been accelerating<br>though and as we look into this next<br>century mass loss from the polar ice<br>sheets is expected to exceed these other<br>contributions to sea-level rise so it<br>will become the dominant player here<br>under future warming so it is imperative<br>that we understand how these large ice<br>sheets will respond to that warming<br>people used to think that these ice<br>sheets were so large that it'd be really<br>hard to perturb them they were kind<br>leaping Giants well it turns out we've<br>woken those Giants up and so now it's<br>our job to figure out how quickly that<br>process will unfold when you hear about<br>melting in Antarctica you in the news<br>you may often hear something about the<br>West Antarctic Ice Sheet and that is on<br>the left side of this diagram here that<br>gives you a little bit of relative size<br>of this very large East Antarctic Ice<br>Sheet and the West which is connected<br>but this is lower down when you look at<br>an overhead map view of this this has<br>some data that superimposed and these<br>big red dots are showing you places<br>where you have a lot of mass loss a lot<br>of ice coming off of Antarctica here the<br>larger the dot the larger the flux of<br>ice is coming off here so the West<br>Antarctica is already showing signs of<br>speeding up and of melting here and the<br>reason that scientists are so worried<br>about West Antarctica is because most of<br>it is what we call marine based that<br>means the bottom of the ice sheet<br>actually sits below sea level so the<br>weight and the thickness of all that ice<br>presses down on the surface of the earth<br>and now the bottom of that ice sheet is<br>sitting below sea level and that means<br>as the waters warm around the Antarctic<br>continent there are basically warming<br>the underbelly of the ice sheet and it<br>is susceptible to very rapid retreat<br>because of that geometry that it has<br>there so when we run the ice sheet<br>models with warm temperatures we often<br>get results that look something like<br>this where we've lost large portions of<br>the West Antarctic Ice Sheet those are<br>these marine base sectors that are very<br>susceptible to retreat and that is what<br>we are worried about as we move into the<br>future and it remains essentially the<br>largest uncertainty in sea level rise<br>projections how is the West Antarctic<br>Ice Sheet going to respond to future<br>warming understanding what the tipping<br>point for it then is you know what's<br>gonna set off this process where it<br>starts to collapse is very important and<br>that's one of the things that we'd like<br>to learn by looking back in time what is<br>the climatic context if this has<br>happened before we can understand how<br>much do you need to warm the wall<br>to get this process to happen okay<br>unfortunately you've already seen the<br>video so you know what it is that I do<br>and why I do it I look at fossil coral<br>reefs we travel around the world that<br>the image you saw I meant to mention at<br>the very beginning of this talk that's<br>in your program is a coral reef terrace<br>from Western Australia these are<br>actually three more pictures from<br>Western Australia we've been working on<br>parts of that coastline that have last<br>interglacial fossil reefs that are<br>exposed off and on over about 1300<br>kilometers so it makes a great place to<br>go to look at this here we go here's the<br>picture again this particular site is<br>actually tectonic lee uplifted and so I<br>used to avoid this site because I wanted<br>to go to a place that was tectonic ly<br>stable so I could understood how much<br>sea level rose in the past not a place<br>that's been affected by tectonics which<br>is going to overprint that signal but we<br>went to visit this site one year one of<br>our colleagues took us there and we knew<br>we had to go back because what was so<br>special about this site is that the<br>whole last interglacial reef has been<br>uplifted and exposed in all its glory<br>and I can see it in three dimensions in<br>most places you just end up walking over<br>the surface of it and you can't see<br>what's underneath and this gave us a<br>real chance to understand how sea level<br>changed during that warm period and what<br>we're using this section for now is to<br>understand does that rise happen<br>gradually how quickly does it happen as<br>the corals grow one on top of the each<br>other and so that's one thing that I do<br>is I date the timing that those corals<br>grew to reconstruct those rates of sea<br>level rise and we also want to know you<br>know if it if it wasn't gradual was<br>there perhaps a big step when we had a<br>collapse of a part of an ice sheet or is<br>it more like going up a staircase where<br>we lose outlet glaciers here and there<br>those are really important questions for<br>coastal planners right now because<br>planning for a gradual rise is a whole<br>different ballgame than planning for a<br>sudden jump that might happen sometime<br>soon and so those are some of the<br>fundamental questions that we're trying<br>to answer looking at this particular<br>section which is still a work in<br>progress but I want to show you a couple<br>pictures from this site because it's<br>really gorgeous you can see this whole<br>section expose<br>and I wanted to also credit some of my<br>colleagues at the University of Sydney<br>we've been working with Jody Webster<br>who's been to many field expeditions<br>with me and one of the students we've<br>been coast supervising Kelsey Sandberg<br>and a student of mine Caroline who's not<br>pictured here who's been working on this<br>section and that's me<br>I did some work - drilling on the reef<br>this is one of the little drills that's<br>easy for us to backpack in you certainly<br>can't get a truck out to this site at<br>all so we have to use equipment that we<br>can carry I did manage to break the<br>drill on this outcrop unfortunately but<br>we got a good three meter core out of it<br>which is what we wanted first and then<br>this particular site is red bluff I<br>don't know if any of you have ever heard<br>of this this is a surfing Mecca in<br>Western Australia so this is the<br>pituitary all the surfing experts in the<br>audience to see the great break that was<br>out there so it's a bunch of surfers and<br>us okay so what I'm gonna do is share<br>with you this story in really two parts<br>one is to look at the deep past to know<br>what we can understand by doing this<br>type of work and then we're going to<br>talk about what that means for the<br>future and that's part two so there's a<br>group that I've been working with for<br>many years now called pal sea for Pat<br>paleo sea level and the focus of this<br>group was to understand the magnitude<br>the rates and the sources of sea level<br>rise during past warm periods and so we<br>brought together ice sheet modelers<br>people who like myself who reconstruct<br>sea level in the field people who<br>reconstruct the position of the ice<br>sheets through time climate modelers<br>everyone's who's looking at these<br>questions but from all different angles<br>and several years ago we decided to<br>write a review paper to summarize what<br>it was we understood about these past<br>warm periods as a community so this is<br>the cartoon diagram that came out of<br>that work that I'm going to share with<br>you today and what you're looking at on<br>the left side here is present-day sea<br>level is at zero by definition and this<br>is the present extent of the ice sheets<br>in Greenland<br>Antarctica we have already warmed the<br>planet by a little more than one degree<br>Celsius relative to pre-industrial times<br>we've done that by ramping up this<br>greenhouse con greenhouse gas<br>concentration in the atmosphere very<br>rapidly shown here to the right is this<br>period I've been talking about the last<br>interglacial about 125,000 years ago<br>when global average temperature was<br>about the same as far as we can tell yet<br>our best estimate is that sea level was<br>some six to nine meters higher or twenty<br>to thirty feet for the Americans are in<br>the audience today for reference as we<br>look at these other warm periods we see<br>that repeatedly every time we warm the<br>earth by somewhere between one to three<br>degrees Celsius that sea level rose by<br>six meters or more which is telling us<br>that yes these ice sheets are sensitive<br>to what might sound like very small<br>changes in temperature and if this is<br>true it means that the ice sheets today<br>are out of equilibrium with the present<br>climate the analogy I often use is it's<br>like taking two ice cubes Greenland and<br>Antarctica and throwing them into a hot<br>room and then standing back and watching<br>what happens and that's what we're doing<br>right now we've heated the temperatures<br>very quickly and now we're watching the<br>process of the melting and catching up<br>to that climate state if you will so<br>that was one of the main takeaways from<br>this synthesis that we put together is<br>that during these recent warm periods<br>these small increases in global<br>temperature meant very lot of sea level<br>rise I just saw someone sigh very deeply<br>him audience this is rather a sobering<br>conclusion to reach I kind of I staged<br>this in the middle of my talk is the<br>most depressing part and I try to lift<br>you back out for the rest of it right so<br>these are some maps of New York City in<br>Florida where I lived for the the past<br>nine years and I've lived in New York<br>City as well what they would look like<br>with six meters the low end of that<br>estimate six to nine six meters of sea<br>level rise and this makes sense in fact<br>because over here in South Florida this<br>was all underwater during the last<br>interglacial we can tell because there<br>are shallow marine deposits all across<br>South Florida right<br>so this is pretty extreme now the good<br>news is that's not gonna happen<br>overnight but it could mean that we're<br>committed to something like this in the<br>future even with the amount of warming<br>that we've already had and that's pretty<br>profound it means that the sea-level<br>rise that we see today is just the first<br>step in what is going to be a very long<br>journey of continuing coastal retreat<br>it's not going to stop in the year 2100<br>which is when you see a lot of the<br>projections ending at the same time it<br>will not be the same everywhere it<br>depends on where that meltwater comes<br>from so if you were to melt water from<br>Greenland it will give you a different<br>pattern of sea level rise across the<br>globe than it would if you melt from<br>Antarctica and that's what is shown here<br>in fact when Greenland melts you end up<br>with a local sea level fall in the dark<br>blue or near to Greenland and as you<br>move farther away it goes higher up<br>which seems very counterintuitive to<br>most people like what about gravity<br>right well actually it is because of<br>gravity that this happens so these ice<br>sheets are so large that they have their<br>own gravitational attraction so the<br>water in the ocean is attracted to that<br>to the big ice sheet as you melt that<br>ice sheet that relaxes that attraction<br>some so in the region of the ice sheet<br>sea level falls a bit even though you've<br>added water into the ocean but are you<br>watching what's happening to my elbow<br>over here in the far field as it falls<br>in the near field puts the ice sheet it<br>is rising over here and so it turns out<br>that in the east coast of the US they<br>are much more concerned about what's<br>happening in Antarctica then in<br>Greenland and New Zealand kind of sits a<br>little bit in the middle huh you need to<br>worry about both for sure right so if we<br>look at what happened during the last<br>interglacial this was our assessment of<br>trying to account which of those ice<br>sheets was contributing to the 6 to 9<br>meters of sea level rise I was talking<br>about and that is broken down here in<br>this diagram so there would be some due<br>to thermal expansion you can know all<br>the rest of the mountain glaciers on the<br>blue<br>only get you up to about one meter of<br>sea level rise we have evidence from the<br>Greenland ice sheet from ice cores from<br>Marine Corps is around the continent and<br>from ice sheet models that tell us that<br>there was a large part of the Greenland<br>ice sheet that did stay intact during<br>the last interglacial so part of it<br>melted but not all of it and the best<br>estimates are somewhere around two<br>meters so we put in two more meters<br>coming from Greenland here in this<br>diagram and then to get up to six to<br>nine meters by subtraction we must have<br>tapped into the Antarctic Ice Sheet<br>right and that that was our assessment<br>here and it is something like five<br>meters which sounds a little bit like<br>what we would expect out of the West<br>Antarctic Ice Sheet but mind you of<br>these uncertainties are quite large if<br>you're looking at those big black lines<br>that I've put on there and so if you<br>take in fact there was a more recent<br>estimate Greenland may have contributed<br>something like five meters during the<br>last interglacial so what would that<br>look like if we take that one study if<br>Greenland contributed five meters on top<br>of the one that we have done here we're<br>already in the range of 6 to 9 meters<br>and we don't need the Antarctic Ice<br>Sheet Oh<br>so what can we tell from the far field<br>records about what happened in<br>Antarctica part of the important thing<br>here is that we can date the precise<br>timing of when those corals grew and<br>it's possible that this changed during<br>the course of the interglacial period<br>which was more than 10,000 years long so<br>it turns out that if we look at the<br>beginning there are some sites that<br>suggest sea level was higher 3 to 6<br>meters higher right at the beginning of<br>the last interglacial now Greenland is<br>known to have kicked in only towards the<br>end of that period so if we were already<br>3 to 6 meters above at the beginning<br>the only thing could have come from is<br>Antarctica and so the the plot twist<br>here is that things may have changed<br>over this time period from the beginning<br>towards the end of the last interglacial<br>that Antarctic Ice Sheet may have melted<br>and it may have started to regrow as<br>Greenland was melting they may have been<br>out of phase and it turns out there's<br>more and more evidence emerging that<br>that may have been the case now that's<br>quite different from what we're doing<br>today today we have warm<br>the atmosphere with greenhouse gases and<br>it is heating both poles at the same<br>time simultaneously so you would have to<br>kind of add these two things together in<br>that sense and so understanding the<br>timing and the source of the ice sheets<br>is in a very important part of the story<br>and there are still a lot of details to<br>be worked out here and so there are some<br>of this is still a hypothesis that's<br>being tested in terms of the part of the<br>beginning with the Antarctic Ice Sheet<br>okay you say so but what can you say and<br>from the tropics did she collapse or not<br>during last interglacial was Mercer<br>right did he get the story right 50<br>years ago so I put up a little diagram<br>here to look at all the different<br>evidences out there not just the fossil<br>reefs we have some evidence from<br>sediments in various places that suggest<br>the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed<br>during the Pleistocene that we don't<br>know quite when so those sit there in<br>the middle because we're not sure if<br>that's last interglacial or not now on<br>the right side of this slide I'm going<br>to put all the studies that suggest that<br>some sector the enteric ice sheet did<br>collapse during the last interglacial<br>period here you go<br>each of those dots is basically one<br>study except for the one down here this<br>is all the different suite of literature<br>that we have on all the far-field fossil<br>coral data that I've been talking about<br>to you various data from ice cores we<br>have data from marine course where we<br>look at the chemistry of the sediment<br>and we can track which bedrock it must<br>have come from and we know that the ice<br>must have retreated far enough to expose<br>that bedrock<br>there are also ice sheet modeling<br>studies there's another site where<br>there's an absence of ice right during<br>the last interglacial at a spot in West<br>Antarctica which suggests that perhaps<br>it wasn't there at that point in time<br>and then there's also evidence from the<br>North Atlantic which is very far away<br>from marine sediments there the<br>chemistry there tells them also a story<br>about this difference in the timing of<br>phasing between Antarctica and Greenland<br>and also suggests a significant<br>contribution from Antarctica so all of<br>these taken together do point to<br>collapse<br>at least some sector of Antarctica I<br>think all but one of them suggests the<br>West Antarctic Ice Sheet and about five<br>of them are so suggest that that<br>contribution happened early which I<br>would say is consistent with what we saw<br>in the far field so while you might look<br>at any individual study and say I can<br>interpret that differently and I'm not<br>really sure that's what that means when<br>you start to look at the whole picture<br>it starts to hold together now on the<br>other side of the story these are the<br>the two studies that I found that<br>suggest it did not that we have some<br>evidence that really says it did not<br>collapse and I should mention the two<br>bubbles with asterisks or ones that are<br>not published yet though I expect them<br>to be published soon and I've spoken to<br>the authors about them so it's not an<br>entirely coherent story yet but I would<br>say the balance of evidence at this<br>point in time certainly tips towards the<br>interpretation that the Western Arctic<br>ice sheet may have collapsed during the<br>last interglacial period so what is the<br>tipping point for this ice sheet this<br>diagram shows this warm water I was<br>talking about bathing the underbelly of<br>the ice sheet and as it warms it that<br>will cause the ice to retreat past this<br>grounding line this is the point at<br>which the ice and the water and the<br>sediment meet together it's pinned right<br>now on this High Point and once it<br>retreats past that pinning point it can<br>start to retreat very quickly and you<br>can't just reverse that process you<br>can't decide next year okay we'll stop<br>you know putting carbon the atmosphere<br>and I'm gonna use my skateboard everyday<br>can't go backwards once this process<br>starts is going to keep going so are we<br>past this tipping point are we near this<br>tipping point there are some colleagues<br>of mine who would argue that we are past<br>that tipping point already and this is a<br>picture of the front of the Thwaites<br>glacier was taken about a year ago the<br>first time any humans had been there to<br>see it it's one of the most vulnerable<br>sectors of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet<br>that they're studying right now but<br>there are people who would argue with<br>this and say no we're not quite there<br>yet either<br>but to me the whole thing about tipping<br>points is you don't really know where it<br>is until you're past it<br>alright thanks oh there was right<br>back there when sea level started<br>growing cool up by centimeters a year<br>instead of millimeters a year the point<br>is that we're probably very close to it<br>where there are on one side or the other<br>of this tipping point some of the<br>modeling suggests that we still have<br>time to stop this from happening and<br>that should give us impetus to do so so<br>that brings us to part two which is the<br>future and I've intentionally left this<br>slide blank to remind us all that the<br>future is still unwritten future is not<br>just a place we get to go to it's a<br>place that we get to create together and<br>I think we've all learned that through<br>this koban crisis that the actions that<br>we take can change the outcomes at the<br>end of the day so what are some of the<br>implications for policy with this<br>understanding that we have from the past<br>and from the past behavior of the<br>Antarctic Ice Sheet one is this issue of<br>sea level commitment right the actions<br>we take today even the warming that<br>we've already done has committed us to a<br>certain amount of sea level rise but<br>it's going to play out<br>over long timescales and this is just<br>the first step in a long journey so if<br>you're making a plan for adaptation it's<br>not just a 2050 or to 2100 you need to<br>have in mind that this is going to be an<br>ongoing process for quite a long time I<br>wanted to give credit to Peter Brannon<br>for tweeting this out the next president<br>of the United States is referring to<br>gets to set the agenda for the next few<br>tens of thousands of years this is not a<br>joke right these actions we make today<br>will have long lasting impacts far<br>beyond our lifetimes one of the<br>questions we are still trying to answer<br>though is this Nate what I call the<br>nature of sea-level rise if it's gradual<br>stepwise if it's that sudden collapse<br>and that will also be very important in<br>terms of developing the right policies<br>the other thing to bear in mind is<br>sea-level rise is more than just<br>inundation so if you build a seawall<br>maybe that might work for a little bit<br>to keep the water from coming in over<br>your home or your business but it will<br>not stop it from intruding into the<br>freshwater aquifers underneath that<br>seawall and at the same time that will<br>bring up health issues in the community<br>you'll have storm water problems loss of<br>coastal resources you can read this list<br>and I can read it out to you quickly but<br>when you're thinking about this you need<br>to think about this whole picture and<br>not just one component of it we'll come<br>back to some of the things on this list<br>in a moment but I wanted to spend a<br>moment on this diagram I think this is<br>the last graph of the talk and this is<br>the one that the c-level scientist is<br>probably the main tool that they hand<br>off to coastal planers in terms of<br>planning they give them some type of sea<br>level rise projection to plan for as we<br>move into the future this one again I<br>apologize is in feet on the vertical<br>axis but if you follow that red curve up<br>to the right to 2100 it takes you to<br>eight feet which is well more than two<br>meters that is hopefully a worst-case<br>scenario that invokes an rapid retreat<br>of the Antarctic Ice Sheet<br>the darkest blue curve at the bottom is<br>just a linear extrapolation of the<br>satellite data that I showed you before<br>but we know that sea level rise is<br>accelerating already so we should<br>probably just take that linear one off<br>because we know that it's accelerating<br>so people look at this and they say well<br>you really know what's gonna happen I<br>mean they're all these curves there it<br>looks really uncertain so why how are we<br>going to plan or do anything and they<br>essentially use the uncertainty as an<br>excuse not to start planning now but I<br>like to look at the flip side of that<br>every single curve is going up right you<br>can have an argument with me about how<br>quickly I think this process might play<br>out and if you talk to a different<br>scientist they might give you a slightly<br>different answer but unquestionably what<br>we need to prepare for is a more watery<br>future and hence we can't use this as an<br>excuse to delay action in the present<br>day but the other comment I wanted to<br>make about this graph is that<br>unfortunately I can guarantee you that<br>sea level rise will not look like any<br>single one of these curves<br>it's very I'm usually here the scientist<br>use the word guarantee like I just did<br>but that's because I know what these<br>data look like<br>which I'll show you in a moment so let's<br>let's pick one of these curves to look<br>at I'm going to pick this one here this<br>green one and say this is we're gonna<br>reach two feet but I don't know the Year<br>2060 or something it doesn't mean that<br>we won't reach two feet until 26<br>it means we're going to reach two feet<br>with increasing frequency until we are<br>there on average so some people look at<br>this and they think oh we have time to<br>prepare to get to two feet so really I<br>think of more useful framework is thing<br>about the frequency of coastal flooding<br>events this is what real sea level data<br>looks like oh sorry this is a tide gauge<br>from Virginia Key which is near Miami<br>Florida just offshore there again it's<br>in feet on the vertical axis everyone<br>knows tides go up in farid a this also<br>shows an annual signal so the king tides<br>that I mentioned before I've been in the<br>autumn fall season and it's lower in the<br>spring and these spikes that you see<br>here are hurricanes Hurricane Irene Rita<br>Wilma which all made landfall in Florida<br>hurricane sandy did not make landfall<br>but it went offshore and created enough<br>as a storm surge that we had extreme sea<br>levels and then in the meantime see that<br>was just creeping up in the back<br>creeping up creeping up and then bang<br>bang bang we get king tide king tide<br>king tide at the same level that used to<br>be only hurricane storm surge level now<br>happens every year and if you talk to<br>the people who live there it's not just<br>one day now it's many days or many<br>consecutive days and at what point are<br>you going to say okay if my driveways<br>flooded one day that's fine but if it's<br>going to be 10 days there was a<br>community that was flooded for more than<br>three months solid last year flooded<br>roads couldn't get out unless you're on<br>a boat right so now we have these<br>extreme events are really what is going<br>to define the future so thinking about<br>this in terms of frequency of coastal<br>flooding I think is a more useful<br>framework this image on the left shows<br>in the year 2017 relative to the year<br>2000 more than a 200% increase in many<br>places around the u.s. in the frequency<br>of coastal flooding in only 17 years the<br>message here is that sea level rise is<br>going to happen faster than you think it<br>well from just looking at the sea level<br>projections that I showed you before<br>so one final story here is in Sugarloaf<br>Key in Florida this is a little bit<br>north of Key West which is down at the<br>bottom they did a study just this last<br>year that was released in early December<br>how much would it cost to keep a single<br>stretch of road that's three miles long<br>they're having some problems with<br>getting in flooding now so how much<br>would it cost to raise the road and keep<br>it dry throughout the year for different<br>years all right so this is to address<br>this issue that some people say oh we<br>can just engineer our way out of this<br>problem right we can just a debt okay so<br>here's to say it says how much is going<br>to cost seventy five million dollars to<br>raise at one point three feet which is<br>their projection that they're using to<br>keep it dry throughout the year you can<br>see how that number blows out up to 2060<br>more than 180 million dollars just for a<br>three-mile stretch of road but think<br>about what happens to the water that<br>would have been sitting on the road now<br>that you've raised it you've pushed it<br>off into people's yards making the<br>flooding worse in their houses right so<br>this is not an effective long-term<br>solution or is it economically viable<br>and what was really interesting when<br>this study came out was that as one of<br>the first times I've seen the<br>politicians say we can't save everyone<br>right this is this is not going to work<br>as the Seas rise and the flooding gets<br>worse not everyone can be saved so if<br>this process is going to happen we need<br>to decide how we want it to play out<br>we can't just engineer our way out of<br>the problem I'm not a huge fan of the<br>idea of sea walls at all not to say that<br>it's not a place in a time for them but<br>a couple of those reasons are listed<br>here one it exacerbates existing racial<br>and social inequality only the<br>communities that can afford to put them<br>in will put them in and once again that<br>water gets displaced the water that<br>would have flooded that land gets pushed<br>out into the communities that couldn't<br>afford it hence making it even worse for<br>them it also builds in a false sense of<br>complacency for those living behind the<br>wall because then they think they're<br>safe and they upgrade their house and<br>everything brick fine we're behind the<br>seawall but at some point it's<br>inevitable that the wall will be<br>breached or it will fail think of New<br>Orleans<br>for example so in the long-term you<br>really have these two options build<br>walls and live in a bowl or you can<br>retreat there's a lot of that dictation<br>in gray area in between but in the long<br>term those are essentially the two and<br>member options so here's the information<br>I have given it to you now what are we<br>going to do about it<br>this is a statue that someone put in in<br>Germany then I think it's brilliant it's<br>a bunch of politicians standing around<br>debating what they should do about<br>climate change sea level rise well the<br>literally happened last year in Venice<br>all that flooding you saw in the news<br>this Italian council was flooded<br>immediately after rejecting measures on<br>climate change karna the time is long<br>past for us to take action on this issue<br>climate change is no longer just a<br>vision of the future it is here today<br>and it is here to stay<br>and it will be getting worse so to<br>conclude I want to take Moe and say what<br>have we learned the polar regions of our<br>planet may seem beyond reach for most of<br>us but they are not beyond our influence<br>despite the fact that they are very<br>distant we have perhaps unintentionally<br>but now very knowingly we are changing<br>these frozen worlds in the polar regions<br>and when you watch nature shows on TV<br>they often present this argument that we<br>should be concerned about all the<br>changes happening because of all of the<br>varied and wondrous forms of life and we<br>should but I don't deny that's true but<br>I want to make a slightly different<br>argument today one that's perhaps a<br>little bit more self-centered in<br>anthropocentric if you will I would like<br>to impress upon you that these seemingly<br>sterile vast expanses are essential to<br>human life as we know it and because the<br>presence and the stability of that ice<br>sheet is so important in dictating<br>patterns and in controlling sea levels<br>that will reshape coastlines around the<br>world that gives us impetus to study the<br>Antarctic continent in past and present<br>so we can understand its future the good<br>news about our experience with the cove<br>in nineteen pandemic because we have to<br>put a silver lining on it right has<br>taught us that when a crisis stares us<br>in the eyes we can mobilize and control<br>our outcome but like global warming we<br>can't make the bank team completely<br>disappear on planet earth but there are<br>lots of actions we can make take to make<br>it a whole lot less bad than it needs to<br>be so in terms of global warming and<br>climate change that primarily means<br>slashing our dependence on fossil fuels<br>and like this global pandemic continue<br>global warming will bring with it dire<br>economic consequences it will expose the<br>weaknesses and social infrastructure and<br>it will hit hardest on already<br>marginalized communities that are least<br>well equipped to respond but this<br>analogy only goes so far there were<br>delays in the progression of Kovach 19<br>right you might be infected<br>she weeks later you might show symptoms<br>he leaks later you might need to be<br>hospitalized key weeks later you might<br>need to die but that meant that by<br>changing our actions we could see we<br>changed course and we saw the difference<br>in a matter of weeks but the time frames<br>here are vastly different if we wait<br>until the impacts of climate change and<br>sea level rise become so urgent to<br>disrupt our lives as much as the coded<br>nineteen pandemic did or even worse as<br>it has for some people already<br>we can't correct course in a matter of<br>weeks which is why the more we do in the<br>earlier we do it the better off we are<br>in the long term now New Zealand is<br>well-positioned to take on this<br>challenge and it's already taking steps<br>in the right direction but those steps<br>must grow and they must do so quickly so<br>my advice to you if I could borrow a<br>phrase is to go hard and<br>thank you thank you very F that quite<br>remarkable talk I thought you said you<br>were going to get positive in the second<br>half of the talk you know Connor just<br>made me what more terrified to be honest<br>and I fully appreciate why you're moving<br>from Florida now I've seen their tide<br>gauge work I was gonna say I'd love to<br>come and work with you in Florida but I<br>think you're in our sacred place in<br>Wisconsin so I'm going to pass it over<br>to the floor for questions now so we<br>have some people online as well so for<br>those that are online just type in a<br>question and we'll try to answer those<br>and that the order that they come<br>through but open for in the room here<br>all right so the question was one graph<br>I didn't show was how sea level rose in<br>the past did it have steps and spikes in<br>it as we go I deliberately haven't even<br>drawn a curve like that yet because I<br>feel like there's still enough<br>uncertainty in the data that you could<br>fit a lot of different scenarios through<br>it but one of the things we are trying<br>to do is is without those individual<br>data points just looking at the outcrop<br>we can tell a lot about looking at the<br>corals and the morphology and how they<br>grew actually how quickly sea level<br>might have been rising and we can see in<br>some of those that I showed you the<br>pictures of evidence for a really rapid<br>pulse right in the middle there and so<br>we're using that type of information to<br>refine our understanding but it's hard<br>to put a precise chronology to some of<br>that so those corals at Red Bluff are<br>all very altered and we're not getting<br>good ages out of them and so it's more<br>kind of relative timing that we're<br>talking about rather than absolutely<br>great surprise but that is certainly<br>what we're working towards is to try to<br>yeah so it's at the same time the<br>analogy is not perfect to last<br>interglacial and I did point out some<br>differences already to you between that<br>time period and what we're experiencing<br>today so we have to bear that in mind<br>but at least it can tell us something<br>about the process of that Ice Sheet<br>retreat and how we might expect it to<br>play out and what the possible rates<br>yes Kevin covert from u.s. embassy<br>thanks again for the talk I know that<br>you were reluctant to say that we can<br>well you did say we can't engineer our<br>way out of this and I think you're<br>saying if I might suggest there's no<br>panacea there's no sort of one solution<br>to this complex problem but can you give<br>us a reason to hold a reason to be<br>optimistic<br>is there any technological or<br>engineering innovation that might help<br>in some way to mitigate this or is there<br>any change in behavior specific behavior<br>that then you can point to that would be<br>helpful constructive that we could talk<br>about promote and advocate right so the<br>question I'm repeating for those of you<br>who are online so you can hear is to ask<br>about the comment I made that we can't<br>just engineer our way out of this and is<br>but is there some engineering things<br>that we can use that give us some hope<br>for the future or are there some<br>behaviors that we can do to change<br>things as we go forward absolutely yes<br>and so there are a lot of really<br>creative plans for some places in terms<br>of how we can change our land use near<br>the coastal regions to help create<br>buffers putting in more mangroves and<br>that type that a lot of the natural<br>buffers that we have removed and that<br>type of thing and all of those things<br>will help I was taking the long term<br>perspective here to say that all of<br>those things only buy us some time from<br>the ultimate problem which is that it's<br>going to keep retreating but there's a<br>lot of promise in deploying those but we<br>also have to remember how we distribute<br>the resources and that's one of the<br>challenges if there is no national plan<br>then it's left to the local level and it<br>really falls to which are the wealthiest<br>to respond in terms of behavior<br>absolutely the reason this is all<br>happening is because of global warming<br>and so sometimes when I've spoken to<br>politicians even in the state of Florida<br>I said well we can't solve sea level<br>rise well be you can because we all need<br>to participate in that process and from<br>New Zealand you might say well we're a<br>small country what can we do a whole lot<br>because if your goal is over here if I'm<br>starting a journey I'm starting a<br>journey soon I'm going back<br>Los Angeles if I don't take the first<br>step in that journey well I'm never<br>gonna get there am i we need to take all<br>the steps which means we need all the<br>teams we need all the states we need all<br>the countries to get to that goal so in<br>terms of behavior yes reducing our<br>carbon emissions and our dependence on<br>fossil fuels is absolutely the most<br>important thing that we can do they<br>No and in fact that has to do with this<br>gravity business that I was talking<br>about before so there's this thing<br>called the mid Holocene heist and which<br>we can explain by changes as the ice<br>sheets melt the solid earth deforms as<br>the weight of those ice sheets changes<br>and the gravity field changes that I<br>talked about with the water being<br>attracted and then going back over here<br>to the far field so for a while it rises<br>and then it starts to draw down a bit<br>due to the superposition of all those<br>effects and so that's basically a<br>geophysical process that's causing local<br>sea-level to be different than the<br>global average and that's really<br>important to remember too when we look<br>at these projections is that we often<br>talk about a global average especially<br>in a setting like this but what people<br>really want to know is what is it going<br>to do here where I am and that's not<br>necessarily the global average today in<br>the tropics because we're melting both<br>poles at once if you remember those<br>fingerprints I showed you of the ice<br>sheets they are highest in the far field<br>when you start to add those on top of<br>each other as you're melting both at the<br>same time it's the tropics that will<br>take the brunt of it they will have the<br>highest sea level rise as we note from<br>okay so this question wants to hear more<br>about the tropics what was the sea level<br>that's happening there and so forth so I<br>didn't delve deeply into the data that<br>we have but what we see during the last<br>interglacial period is that sea level<br>does rise and that's why you see those<br>reefs we're building on top of each<br>other and the picture that I showed you<br>over time but there's evidence there are<br>several episodes of reef growth right so<br>we actually have kind of these pulses of<br>sea level rise<br>now what's driving that may not be<br>perfectly analogous to the modern day<br>but it does give us some estimates on<br>these it's probably capable of having<br>fairly rapid rates of rise as these ice<br>sheets retreat so that's one thing that<br>we are learning from that the other<br>thing that we are looking at and I'm<br>always working with people who are<br>basically coral reef paleo biologists is<br>to understand how the reefs respond to<br>the sea level rise and the changes in<br>temperature those reefs were able to<br>keep up with that sea level rise and as<br>we see there because the stuff at the<br>top is growing in extremely shallow<br>water and so it's keeping up with the<br>rate of sea level rise they did not get<br>drowned but the challenge is that the<br>reefs today are not in the same state of<br>health as they were back then so in fact<br>when you go snorkeling in the Caribbean<br>it looks nothing like what we see in the<br>fossil record anymore because it's been<br>so devastated for many things from<br>overfishing from disease all kinds of<br>things together that means the reef will<br>not be as able to respond and keep up<br>with the sea level<br>Rhys which is a pity because that's a<br>buffer to the coastlines from that wave<br>energy so as sea level rises that will<br>leave the coasts more exposed now there<br>are people who are studying this kind of<br>rate of accretion how quickly can the<br>coral reefs of Crete how quickly are<br>they doing it in the modern day and<br>there's some debate back and forth about<br>when and you know exactly they would get<br>drowned but for sure their state of<br>health is a concern and as they<br>continuously are getting bleached now as<br>we're seeing not just in isolated spots<br>but almost this kind of an global events<br>of coral bleaching and they die then<br>they're gonna be rebuilding rather than<br>trying to keep up with sea-level rise<br>and so it will look different in the<br>future than it did for this past warm<br>period in that sense so I'm just gonna<br>ask an online question here from Juliet<br>and do you think that corals provide<br>enough vertical precision to tell us<br>about sub metre scale and tactical<br>aashiq contributions so because it's<br>really around uncertainties of your<br>coral reef yeah and that's it so this is<br>a great question because oftentimes the<br>largest uncertainty in these<br>reconstructions is okay well here's the<br>coral but wherever is sea level because<br>some corals can grow quite deep and some<br>can grow shallow and one way to look at<br>that is to look at what species of coral<br>you have they have different preferences<br>of water depth we've taken that some<br>steps further to look at the whole coral<br>assemblage the coral and algae all the<br>corals the morphology of the corals<br>sometimes they have these very<br>interesting forms in shallow water so<br>we're trying to refine that and it<br>depends on the locality some places we<br>are not able to put good vertical<br>precision are some we are so in the<br>Seychelles which is one of the sites<br>I've been working at we have found<br>outcrops and corals that tell us we are<br>in less than 2 metres of water and when<br>we have taken samples from different<br>outcrops on different islands all the<br>data points plot on top of each other<br>which means they're not living at all<br>different water depths they're all<br>capturing this very shallow water signal<br>so for that particular place I would say<br>yes we are capturing you're less than 2<br>metres scale and we can use it but<br>that's not going to be the case for all<br>of the reefs that we study and but<br>something that we really need to be<br>aware of is this vertical precision and<br>that's<br>sazkebab more online question this is<br>from Paul Bruce the rate of present<br>warming is phenomenal compared to that<br>of the proceeded into glacial periods<br>can sudden warming result in different<br>dynamical collapse of the ice sheets yes<br>I imagine it could so and again this is<br>another great example of why it's not a<br>perfect analogy and so we always need to<br>keep in the back of my what can we<br>extrapolate kind of straight across<br>right versus what can we say as a<br>benchmark so a lot of the work that<br>we're doing is trying to have some<br>constraint how quickly can this process<br>occur which right now we can't answer<br>with the ice sheet models and that gives<br>us at least some constraint on what is<br>physically possible but pushing them<br>fast for sure could could end up with a<br>different consequence there's only so<br>fast though that you can discharge<br>icebergs from an ice sheet and that's<br>where we end up having to rely on the<br>models and that's the parts we're still<br>working out so while things are<br>accelerating they can't accelerate<br>infinitely this is the point and the<br>question is how fast can that go and I<br>suppose the more examples we have the<br>it's the tide gauge or the not sure<br>which one you want one of these<br>oh the interglacials way back okay you<br>want to start asking well I find it it's<br>right so do you think Oh a tional<br>inception yes okay<br>so the question is what was driving this<br>variability in sea level in the past and<br>how is that different from today and<br>what is the process that's driving the<br>beginning of these glacial periods which<br>we called glacial inception so this<br>hundred thousand year cycle is really<br>dictated by how much of sun's energy is<br>reaching the Earth's surface so it's<br>small variations in the shape and the<br>wobble of the Earth's orbit around the<br>Sun and that has enough of an effect on<br>the amount of sun's energy that's coming<br>in that it causes these ice sheets to<br>grow and to shrink over time now that is<br>different than what we are doing today<br>today we have more than 400 parts per<br>million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere<br>during the last interglacial it was only<br>280 parts per million so it was not<br>forced by a higher greenhouse gas<br>concentration it was these changes in<br>Earth's orbit that we're creating the<br>changes in climate then right so that is<br>different so then the question is can we<br>expect to go into an ice age soon and<br>the problem is we have now pushed<br>ourselves so far out of this envelope if<br>I were to plot on this this diagram this<br>is sea level if this was co2 it which<br>looks very similar to this graph and<br>this is here we'd be like way up here<br>now and I do have a slide like that I<br>just didn't include it today we're off<br>the charts in terms of greenhouse gas<br>concentration so we were within this<br>envelope where we had this positive<br>feedbacks and negative feedbacks kind of<br>kept it within this window and now we've<br>pushed ourselves outside that we will<br>not naturally go back into this cycle<br>anymore and so that's one thing that<br>people often ask me they say often we<br>hear these feedbacks and there<br>seemed to be bad what we call positive<br>feedbacks which is a terrible word makes<br>the worming warm makes the warming worse<br>to harden this tongue twister - there<br>are feedbacks that go in the other<br>direction but they work on much longer<br>timescales and that's really the big<br>challenge we are pushing this system so<br>fast and that's why we have pushed<br>outside of this envelope is the rate of<br>warming and the rate of change that<br>we're seeing the coral reefs can't keep<br>up those larvae can't disperse to higher<br>latitudes fast enough to migrate away<br>from the hot tropics and that type of<br>thing great question I'm just gonna ask<br>one more online question because it's<br>quite related to that what about the<br>impacts of other frozen areas that are<br>melting such as northern Russia or<br>permafrost any studies there were more<br>potential future implications right so<br>there are lots of studies in those<br>regions and I haven't been doing them<br>I've been waltzing around the tropical<br>islands but I do have people who are<br>reconstructing sea level and higher<br>latitudes people who are studying the<br>changes in the permafrost there's no<br>question that the high latitudes are<br>experiencing change much faster than the<br>rest of the planet and it's hard to keep<br>up it's hard to keep up with science so<br>most is coming out it's emerging as<br>we're seeing these changes happen so<br>rapidly so yes there will be large<br>changes in the Arctic region and the<br>permafrost areas sea level will change<br>there too and it depends again on which<br>ice sheet contributes to the melting as<br>to how much sea level rise you will see<br>in that region right places that are<br>very close to Greenland have less to<br>worry about from Greenland melting but<br>okay any last questions from the room<br>yes<br>yes so the question is about a study it<br>came out in 2013 in Nature Geoscience<br>Weymouth O'Leary and they concluded that<br>there was a late spike in sea level<br>during the last interglacial went up to<br>about 9 meters or so it was quite high<br>so part of the reason they got that they<br>plotted on the graph data from all up<br>and down the Western Australian<br>coastline and one of the sites that they<br>put on there was that when I just showed<br>you was red bluff which is tectonic Li<br>uplifted and since then there's a PhD<br>student who's gone through and is<br>demonstrated that the last interglacial<br>Terrace itself is warped and has been<br>tectonic Leda formed it's not just old<br>tectonics it's been quite recent but<br>it's been deformed and so those high<br>points that they have are probably a<br>tectonic artifact and not part of like a<br>global sea-level signal and so I don't<br>think there's any evidence there of a<br>late spike in sea level another reason<br>that I say that is the corals at the<br>very top of the outcrop are some of the<br>shallowest water ones so when we look at<br>the coral assemblages and the<br>morphologies and there's even these big<br>nodules of coral and algae that only<br>grow out kind of in the tidal range now<br>that's it right at the top there so<br>actually it's showing us those were<br>right at sea level they were not drowned<br>at the end there's we see no evidence of<br>I'm gonna ask one last question from the<br>online group and this is probably a<br>loaded question so don't start Kerry<br>going through New Zealand but perhaps<br>deviating too far from your talk but<br>hopefully related enough are there any<br>governments that you know of leading the<br>way in terms of policy for the required<br>retreat case bleeding away on policy<br>well I have been very impressed with<br>what's happening here in New Zealand and<br>part of my time here has been learning<br>about that I think we can all learn by<br>looking at each other though there's no<br>silver bullet which someone said before<br>there's no one way to solve this problem<br>and how we solve it is going to depend<br>on where we are - so one country<br>solutions will not be the same as<br>another it depends on where you're<br>starting from and where you have to get<br>to so I think the point is though that<br>we really need<br>be active and participating in that<br>process and knowing that some of its<br>going to be trial and error we can sit<br>around and argue all day and do studies<br>and figure out what's going to be the<br>best way well in the meantime all right<br>we're fiddling well from these burning<br>yes so more action is better than none<br>and some of its going to be trial and<br>error and we will learn along the way<br>some things that work and some things<br>that don't ok so withdraw the questions<br>to a close I just want to give a final<br>thank you to Professor button for you<br>know quite a remarkable talk so just a<br>around the applause for her there it<br>feels weird using your formal title<br>because she's ready footed into the AR C<br>family she's been here for the last six<br>months we've seen her for about a month<br>you know it was a real pity that it did<br>get broken up like that but we saw each<br>other a lot on zoom' and you know one of<br>your rewards is you're actually supposed<br>to be the 2019 st lee lecture we're<br>going to have it right at the start of<br>the year so now your lecturer for two<br>years in a row<br>yeah you get a double reward there but<br>yeah we will be very very sad to see you<br>go cuz it just feels like we're just<br>starting to get started on this sort of<br>linking the tropics to these these are<br>rather more difficult wrinkles to deal<br>with an Antarctic and the tropical coral<br>reefs a beautiful chronologies very<br>precise sea levels and we deal with<br>scraps and but we can piece together<br>those parts of the puzzles and we are<br>starting to get there so a few more<br>weeks would have been great but we're<br>certainly wishing you the best in your<br>new job in Wisconsin thank you for<br>everyone for turning up at the late<br>notice<br>obviously they were moving goal posts<br>pretty rapidly with this and we're very<br>lucky that I've got to level one and<br>have a full almost a full house with us<br>here and also a very healthy group<br>online almost equal number online as<br>well so just the testament of the<br>quality of the talk and the speaker the<br>other talk was as I say it's not<br>comfortable reading is that what we're<br>watching you know takes home to me that<br>point are we getting near a tipping<br>point a non-tree I talked about these<br>imperfect analogs in the past they're<br>not perfect analogs<br>she talked about the ice sheets in the<br>past potentially acting out of phase and<br>humans have perturb the system so<br>greatly that it appears that both going<br>at the same time so we're doing<br>something nature couldn't do potentially<br>which is sort of mad science in a way<br>but unfortunate there's a lot of people<br>involved in that experiments yeah so<br>yeah just highlighting also that fact of<br>the rates where treats is that that sort<br>of Holy Grail we need to get to and<br>that's where they can really help are we<br>looking at centimeters per year if we<br>get in there then that some even more<br>terrifying than that final tide gauge<br>that you showed from Florida so some<br>very important questions not a perfect<br>analog but it helps provide context what<br>we may be going into in the future also<br>what I think again doctor leasing T for<br>sponsoring this lecture series it has<br>become an incredibly important part of<br>our academic calendar as I say it's just<br>unfortunate we had the delay this year<br>with the shutdown but it just highlights<br>just how important it is to get into a<br>room and discuss these sort of issues<br>and in the sort of science and also<br>thank you for 10 nice for really helping<br>to organize your visit here as well as<br>logistics around this visit and the<br>lecture and also thank you to the the<br>front staff in the Antarctic Research<br>Center so much out there and in<br>particular del Del Paso oh sorry<br>policy sorry and for for organizing the<br>lecture and really sitting this all up<br>and so we've organized some drinks and<br>nibbles upstairs so yeah thank you very<br>much for that so just a round of<br>applause for here as well</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
