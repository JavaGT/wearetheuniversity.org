automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>if you enjoyed<br>studying classical studies languages and<br>history at school<br>if you're analytical and a critical<br>thinker<br>and you want to help improve access to<br>justice for all kiwis<br>then a bachelor of laws is the right<br>degree for you<br>i've gathered some current students<br>graduates and staff<br>to tell you why you should choose<br>auckland law school for your<br>law degree but first let me give you a<br>few<br>fast facts we are the leading law school<br>in new zealand<br>at the top university in the country<br>with the highest ranking for graduate<br>we're located in the heart of the legal<br>precinct<br>right next door to the high court and<br>leading law firms<br>we have the largest law library in new<br>zealand<br>and 16 student clubs and associations<br>speaking of students let's hear from<br>some of them now<br>my favorite part of law school so far<br>has been getting involved in clubs such<br>as tadako today<br>and getting involved meant that i<br>met incredible people on top of that<br>there's of course<br>the amazing academics they are legends<br>in their fields<br>i was able through this whole journey to<br>connect with my<br>turifano without the friends that i had<br>made<br>in tadako today there is no way that i<br>would have been able to get this far<br>in my degree and again it's that<br>whakafanogatanga<br>that we all have and being a part of<br>that group<br>so what i found is that law school isn't<br>the cutthroat<br>competitive environment that it's<br>portrayed to be in the movies and<br>television your lecturers are really<br>really willing to help and they do want<br>you to succeed<br>being involved with producing the<br>auckland university law review<br>mooting mediation advocacy student<br>mentoring<br>they've all been a really big part of my<br>experience while i've been at auckland<br>law school and i think it's actually<br>quite a unique aspect of the auckland<br>law school experience<br>my favorite thing about life at auckland<br>law school<br>is the opportunity that there's been to<br>form<br>community with other people you do meet<br>people who are very much like you and<br>very different to you but they're all so<br>much fun<br>be prepared to work really hard but also<br>know that you will have one of the<br>greatest experiences of your life at<br>university this is not just<br>with regard to your study and enjoying<br>what you you are learning but i mean<br>most of your experiences outside of your<br>study they make it all 100<br>worth it the more you put into your<br>experience at law school the more you're<br>going to get out of it<br>what is your why what is your purpose<br>around why you want to study for me<br>you know i didn't have the greatest<br>upbringing and it was really tough as a<br>kid<br>trying to navigate my way through that<br>so when i got to the end of<br>high school for me it was making sure<br>that whatever i did going forward it was<br>to make sure that<br>other kids could benefit from my<br>education in the future<br>just give it a go like the beauty of<br>first year is that<br>you're forced to take it with another<br>degree<br>so you do basically like the start of<br>your conjoint the nice thing is that<br>they give you a few papers in first year<br>that'll give you a real taste of what<br>law school is like i enjoyed reading<br>writing and researching<br>and for me law seemed to tick all those<br>boxes whilst keeping my career options<br>relatively open<br>when i started and i sat in my first<br>one-two-one paper<br>i learnt about indigenous rights and<br>human rights<br>and i think now that's really what has<br>driven me<br>to complete this degree and to go on to<br>practice in<br>eb corporate governance it was a random<br>reason actually so in year 10<br>i had my teacher tell me off about<br>something and he told me that i would<br>love a career in politics or the legal<br>field because i was so good at arguing<br>my way out of things<br>as i grew older obviously shows like<br>suits came out and i was like<br>oh being a lawyer would be really really<br>cool a really important discovery for me<br>was<br>how the law can sneak into nearly every<br>industry i could think of<br>though i study law i don't want to be a<br>lawyer in a law firm<br>but that's okay because my law degree is<br>setting me up<br>you might say what's what's different<br>about law from other subjects and<br>what do you do in law school do you just<br>learn all these boring old laws you know<br>law 1<br>law 2 law 305 law 480.<br>no and you do learn quite a lot about<br>the law but law is a thinking process<br>it's<br>it's a process of reasoning and that's<br>why it's such a valuable subject to to<br>do no matter what you're doing you do in<br>life<br>an llb is a distinctive degree because<br>it prepares you specifically for<br>a legal career now traditionally that<br>has meant entering the profession as a<br>practicing lawyer but in a modern<br>context it can include a range of<br>career options law impacts virtually<br>everything else that we<br>do in society how we live how our<br>families are organized<br>our relationship to the government when<br>the government can take away our liberty<br>what happens when we harm each other etc<br>etc<br>well obviously you learn the law but<br>there is no<br>such thing as just law there is the law<br>of the sea<br>there is the law of the treaty of<br>waitangi there's family law there's<br>intellectual property law environmental<br>law<br>criminal law company law contract law<br>you name it if we teach you how to have<br>a reason and use the law<br>to solve problems and solving problems<br>is a really important skill<br>you're going to learn how to advocate<br>so how to argue a point how to make<br>a case for something it's also a lot of<br>public speaking getting up on your feet<br>and being able to persuade and make<br>presentations to various audiences<br>what's not exciting about it is probably<br>the right question there<br>well i think it's exciting i did it and<br>i liked it so much i<br>am now a law professor law is is<br>exciting because it involves<br>so many other aspects of life law is<br>really a complex human system and<br>getting to understand that system is<br>what's exciting about doing a law degree<br>you need to be someone who likes to read<br>and likes to write<br>and who can think critically on their<br>feet a good law student is also someone<br>who is good with people<br>has empathy understands their problems i<br>think a good law student is someone<br>curious about the world<br>all types of people study for a law<br>degree we need everyone<br>why is that because all the voices need<br>to be heard<br>and it's the only way that we're going<br>to have constructive dialogue and to<br>make a legal system which benefits<br>everybody and even if you don't<br>necessarily<br>uh want to practice law there's many<br>other things i've had<br>law students go off and be become for<br>example senior<br>managers and directors of banks<br>directors of companies some go off and<br>work in the human rights field overseas<br>they go off and do work for the war<br>trying stability yucas live here in the<br>pol pot regime<br>now it's not strictly practicing as a<br>lawyer so we do have some compulsory<br>courses and the best analogy i can give<br>is kind of like if you're building a<br>house<br>think about your education as building a<br>house in your life and so we need to lay<br>the foundation first and foremost and so<br>we'll give you some compulsory classes<br>to do that but then you've got<br>two and a half years where you start<br>doing what we call electives and there<br>you can<br>choose what papers you do and that's a<br>fabulous time of the degree<br>many students will arrange their study<br>in a way that allows them to focus on a<br>particular area of law that's of<br>interest to them so if you're someone<br>who likes criminal law like me<br>you'll take all the criminal law classes<br>you can if there's someone who likes<br>environmental law you'll take all the<br>environmental law classes you can so in<br>essence you kind of create your own<br>specialization<br>through the the courses you take we have<br>the largest array of courses to deal<br>with<br>mighty and indigenous legal issues of<br>any of the law schools we have<br>the largest number of maori academics<br>who are working and researching<br>in indigenous peoples and maori related<br>issues<br>we have awesome scholarships for our<br>tawidamani<br>we offer things such as academic support<br>as well as pastoral care<br>we also provide you with opportunities<br>to attend things such as<br>exam and we also have general law<br>tutorials which are taught by our

unfamiliar<br>with what mooching is as i was when i<br>was in my first year<br>it is basically a simulated court<br>environment so<br>you're a lawyer you have to go to court<br>and represent a client<br>who in a lot of cases has probably done<br>something wrong<br>and you have to present their case in<br>front of actual<br>judges if you're lucky enough to make it<br>to the finals<br>you will very likely be meeting in the<br>auckland high court<br>in front of actual auckland high court<br>judges which is just<br>an incredible opportunity you get to<br>learn substantive skills that you would<br>never learn in class<br>really niche interesting areas of law<br>but also test those formative skills as<br>well<br>while liaising with real judges real<br>lawyers<br>and real senior law students who you<br>might not meet<br>otherwise<br>my name is sarah i am currently a<br>solicitor<br>at ufloor artero so uflo ateroa<br>is a specialist community law centre our<br>focus is on young people<br>so young people up to the age of 25 can<br>contact us<br>and receive free legal advice hello<br>everyone my name is kaye patel i'm a<br>manager at pwc<br>in our technology transformation team<br>dakota my name is george tadaki grieg<br>i'm with the ministry of foreign affairs<br>and trade but with covert i've actually<br>been redeployed<br>so i'm currently on mfat's covert<br>response team so we produce a lot of the<br>policy<br>that goes up to all those decision<br>makers so cabinet and the likes<br>it's cool stuff hi there my name is<br>danielle i work at ernst young which is<br>one of the four global accounting firms<br>i'm a tax consultant in the<br>international transaction tax services<br>team<br>i was very involved in my local church i<br>was the welfare vice president<br>and as part of that i helped provide<br>student welfare<br>on campus so things like hardship grants<br>and food parcels to students who are in<br>need<br>i was really into trying to build new<br>hobbies and interests when i was at uni<br>there are a whole lot of things i always<br>wanted to get into so the big two that<br>occupied you know quite a bit of my time<br>was powerlifting and mixed martial arts<br>i did the auckland law review<br>we booked out a few nights at sky city<br>and put on a massive show<br>if you haven't heard about auckland law<br>review just google it<br>yeah you'll see what we mean but what i<br>didn't realize is that actually<br>representatives from all the top<br>law firms in the country were in the<br>auditorium at sky city watching<br>some of our shows because they were<br>really interested in making sure that<br>they hire<br>well-rounded people as well one of the<br>things you need to think about<br>whether the institution that you go to<br>ends up providing you<br>with a number of extracurricular things<br>to broaden your experiences to give you<br>a well-rounded cv and i believe that<br>this sets auckland<br>law school apart from all of the law<br>schools in the country so it's okay<br>to recognize that it is tough and that<br>you do need to talk to someone or you do<br>need to look after yourself<br>outside of just grades and studying all<br>the time<br>so look after yourself i would say that<br>you don't need to be able to see<br>the end career goal<br>when you are picking your degree or your<br>majors<br>i think it's more important just to<br>figure out what you're interested in<br>and find a path or direction that you<br>want to go down<br>i i would say commit to at least one<br>year of volunteering in a community law<br>center not only you getting these<br>invaluable skills but you're also you're<br>learning and you're developing<br>you know and you're actually helping<br>your community from day number one<br>start thinking about the kinds of firms<br>organizations or societies that you want<br>to join<br>and then just meet them cold call them<br>cold email them<br>or if you can walk up to them and<br>introduce yourself you don't have to say<br>anything<br>einsteinian you don't have to be genius<br>you don't have to impress them<br>just do something get your name in front<br>of them and get your face in front of<br>them<br>and then build a network whether you're<br>working in hr or technology<br>or the law of course the ability to<br>communicate a point of view<br>in a clear calm well-considered manner<br>it's just so important if i could leave<br>you with one i guess principle<br>it's that yeah of course if you want to<br>be a lawyer go to law school but<br>law school is a really good option to<br>consider regardless of whether you want<br>to be a lawyer or not and there are some<br>skills and experiences that you'll get<br>at law school which is incredibly useful<br>you won't get them anywhere else i<br>remember pinching myself one day because<br>i was in the sky in the police<br>helicopter<br>kind of chasing after this this<br>suspected perp and<br>they needed somebody on board to<br>basically make sure that they were<br>following proper procedure and i got to<br>i got to<br>follow along the chopper looking down<br>from the sky and i just remember<br>pitching i think to myself thinking what<br>the hell am i doing how do i get to do<br>this<br>i'm a uni student this is fantastic so<br>you get some fantastic opportunities at<br>auckland law school<br>make the most of them just absolutely<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
