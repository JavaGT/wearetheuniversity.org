accurate.</p><p>kiara New Zealand and good morning the<br>world and good evening to those from the<br>United Kingdom who are with our guest<br>speakers today today we're going to look<br>at the topic of smart tourism and a new<br>era of tourism why is this topic<br>important well and if we've looked at<br>previous webinars we've talked about how<br>some technology trends will accelerate<br>and some technology trends will will<br>change the booking system will be used<br>as a latest substitute but what are<br>these technologies and particularly<br>smart tourism meaning this mean in this<br>new era of tourism so today we have a<br>prominent speaker who's going to focus<br>on smart tourism I'm smart tourism new<br>technologies what they mean within a<br>city context what they mean within a<br>business context but basically what do<br>they mean in a post call back world post<br>call vat19 world and the key thing is we<br>night we focus we design and we engineer<br>our keynote today is a prominent<br>professor and professor to me Tricia<br>Palace is the world's leading expert in<br>tourism technology that's without doubt<br>Demetrius is a professor at Bournemouth<br>University director of the e lab at the<br>University he's editor in Terry chief of<br>the world's oldest tourism journal and<br>tourism review and he's a prominent<br>speaker writes prolifically high profile<br>within the media and it's a pleasure<br>today to welcome Demetrius to New<br>Zealand Demetrius fantastic to be with<br>you I would waste physical presence so<br>you can enjoy a nice drink and have some<br>fun together thank you very much for the<br>invitation great pleasure it's really<br>difficult times and<br>they find really difficult to operate in<br>this kind of environment where children<br>have actually posed for a minute and<br>there's a lot of uncertainty several<br>countries including New Zealand has done<br>very very well as far as Cove is<br>concerned but then they're paying that<br>with the economic consequences of their<br>main markets and a lot of people are<br>suffering now before I say anything else<br>I'm afraid ends with me suffering<br>car-manufacturing suffering the oil<br>industry suffering everybody suffering<br>and I think we really need to stop<br>looking to how we can put the next day<br>and how can be very clever and smart and<br>use real time big data to actually take<br>advantage of the resources we have in<br>every way in the COBE that the postcode<br>era being we're still in the middle of<br>the pandemic so we're still suffering<br>from it and we're still on the emergency<br>stage gradually we are going out of it<br>so Cove is a crisis unlike any other and<br>the reason for that is because it's<br>because we don't know how we're gonna<br>get out of it normally the crisis with<br>daily we think tourism we dealt with<br>them in a few days a week maximum and we<br>were you remember September 11<br>it took about a week for flights to<br>restart and gradually they are getting<br>back to back to travelling again kind of<br>catastrophes and disasters but actually<br>they happened within a very short period<br>of time and then we went back to to<br>recovery mode he was still in a very<br>prolonged crisis situation where we<br>don't know<br>tamati may have second waves and that is<br>really the cause of this unprecedented<br>disaster that we are facing this is both<br>last Easter and this is both this Easter<br>you can see the difference<br>so people disappear it we stayed at home<br>could be protected and this believe it<br>or not with all the all the aircraft<br>because there's not enough space in his<br>room in other rough seas make great<br>captains this is a crisis unlike any<br>other and we need to see the skills in<br>curve we can navigate out of this<br>situation but what we say in resilience<br>is that we're not gonna return back to<br>where we used to be but we'll return we<br>depart to a new future and those people<br>who understand this new future will be<br>in a much better position to navigate<br>the right place we need to look forward<br>because the past becomes in a level and<br>a little bit early in two years when<br>Mother industries they're looking at the<br>mirror to navigate the path in the<br>future and that's a very dangerous<br>driving technique you really need to<br>look forward and you need to be very<br>smart in taking all the information<br>wherever it's coming and make sure that<br>it's relevant to where you are going not<br>where you have been the only certainty<br>is uncertainty and the crisis is<br>absolutely certain what we don't know is<br>the response card a response is going to<br>take place if you fail to prepare<br>prepare to fail and we've seen a lot of<br>countries that they have actually<br>prepared faith the good news is of where<br>life almost 500 thousand people have<br>died from coffee almost nine million<br>people have been infected by comet<br>and a lot of people has suffered real<br>consequences and will be suffering for<br>the rest of their life hopefully all of<br>us have not had any major impact from<br>coffee and they've been healthy and safe<br>we can reignite tourism because we are<br>so blessed with wonderful assets and<br>this kind of crisis does not destroy the<br>assets does not destroy the product does<br>not destroy the brand it does not<br>destroy the effort to recreate and<br>co-create experiences and it's still<br>enable us to to keep going with the<br>resources we've got most of the crisis<br>that we have in tourism they destroy our<br>infrastructure or superstructure I love<br>hotels airports have been destroyed by<br>by by disasters in the past Cove it is<br>not one of those so in that sense we are<br>lucky because we can actually go to the<br>next stage and this is the day actually<br>you remember a couple of months ago<br>nobody on the beach today I went by the<br>beach and I sold these people and I went<br>straight away and straight back because<br>I'm really concerned what they're doing<br>and I think they're not keeping the two<br>metres that the government is advising<br>and I see a lot of problems with that<br>but but you can see as soon as as soon<br>as the government says you can go out<br>even before immediately people take<br>advantage and they go back to the<br>tourism industry because because the<br>products and the infrastructure is still<br>there this will become comprehensive<br>strategic response who have been<br>developing and I don't have time to<br>explain all of it but basically calling<br>for human resources money strategies<br>operation process projects and<br>propositions distribution pricing<br>strategy and competitiveness and<br>destination services to coordinate<br>according to the requirements of each<br>particular organization and each<br>particular destination because all<br>organizations are very different to each<br>other and each destination is very<br>different to each other so there's not<br>one much<br>and I said before everybody but you<br>really need to have a friend where you<br>look after your money<br>you can look after your baby now you can<br>look after you you can look after your<br>customers and and really important how<br>can you look after your your stuff I<br>think one of the things that we've seen<br>in Kovac was the level of solidarity<br>that we've experienced with this never<br>happened before and the the that the<br>different kind of sectors of the<br>ecosystem have been pushed together to<br>operate together and the other things<br>we've seen in in the covert situation is<br>how important digital is and how<br>electronic tools becoming the core<br>infrastructure to actually manage their<br>own situation and and a lot of comics of<br>experience digitization steroids in the<br>last three three months they've just<br>moved so far that have never managed to<br>do for years and years and years what do<br>you read good night<br>you really there's some people that<br>they're going out and they're talk about<br>coffee safe there's no coffee safe place<br>in the world but there must be some<br>places that their coffee's ready in<br>terms of their smart in terms of the<br>protocols froze ecosystems energy and<br>where technology is coming into into<br>consideration a lot of people would like<br>to know information in advance like to<br>be really assumed about the safety of<br>destinations by providing real-time and<br>context basic context based information<br>location critical so before people start<br>traveling to a place they really need to<br>know what's happening the location at<br>that particular moment clientele space<br>architecture service personnel process<br>and business models they're all part of<br>the real-time information that we need<br>to have and engagement we need to have<br>you know that co-create tourism in the<br>new in the new environment because each<br>of those things determining<br>can open safely and how we can make sure<br>that we restructure the business in a<br>way that can be supported in in the<br>future<br>Ian already talked about the new normal<br>and I say it's really about to be ignite<br>and reignite is enabling people to<br>restart the industry and start taking<br>business and help with their cash flow<br>then start refocusing on what we do<br>longer-term we start with redesigning<br>what we do what kind of products what<br>kind of experience we could create and<br>eventually longer term we really need<br>the reengineering off of everything<br>we're doing and the engineering can be<br>on the process but also can build the<br>innovations and the products and the<br>experience and everything everything we<br>do but reengineering enable us to to<br>have a good look into what we do and<br>start again from white paper and<br>redesign everything we do in order to<br>make sure that we are value to all the<br>stake holders that we've got in the<br>marketplace and there's so many<br>different stakeholders out there that<br>they all expect tourism to actually<br>provide services and products that<br>satisfies and cut creates value and<br>satisfies all their needs and that's<br>quite complicated this were smartness<br>and agility is coming forward because<br>technology enable us to understand<br>better what is happening in our context<br>by connecting everybody together and<br>enabling the transformation of big data<br>in real time we're able to create a<br>real-time knowledge about what is<br>happening a lot of people are talking<br>about smartness and they talk about not<br>was like technology actually it's not<br>it's really about network optimization<br>it's really about taking advantage of<br>the interconnectivity and<br>interoperability of integrate<br>technologies to really near present day<br>that in order to produce innovative<br>services products and procedures to<br>maximize value for stakeholders<br>the reengineering enable enables saving<br>in reshaping products actions process<br>services in real time by engaging<br>different stakeholders simultaneously to<br>optimize the collective performance and<br>competitiveness collective is really<br>critical here because but about all<br>organizations operating together and to<br>create agile solutions and value for<br>everybody who is involved in the in the<br>in the ecosystem this is really critical<br>to develop interoperability and<br>interconnectivity for mutually<br>beneficial systems and I think this is<br>the first time that we look systems<br>everybody together and engage in real<br>time with all the stakeholders in order<br>to maximize the value for everybody not<br>true once they call another one and<br>that's that's a beautiful way to to<br>achieve with smartness smartness takes<br>advantage of networks in terms of<br>interoperability interconnectivity takes<br>advantage of the increment of things and<br>the in terms of everything sensors that<br>they collect information and beacons of<br>their project information big data and<br>data analytics that they're constantly<br>analyzing all the data that's coming<br>through social media that they are<br>looking to use it generated content and<br>web - and technological enablers and<br>opportunities to co-create experience<br>through competition and cooperation<br>collaboration competition at the same<br>time in order to do that we really need<br>to understand the in terminal makes them<br>in fact those the internal factors are<br>really about likes<br>goals preferences tasks emotional state<br>whose abilities disobey this approaches<br>topics of interest and personal event so<br>it's really about you in this particular<br>moment now when Ian goes travelling with<br>his camera he is a different cover layer<br>than when he is going to a conference or<br>when he is going with his family so who<br>really need understand what is the<br>person what does he what does the person<br>and dislikes what's the preference what<br>the cones that person is trying to<br>achieve and also we need to understand<br>we external factors what the season with<br>the patience the location with the<br>emergence strikes whether light traffic<br>air pressure delays all of those things<br>nobody of course I had imagined<br>pandemics because I've never gone<br>through that but but this the external<br>external factors that they control the<br>environment how we operate so once you<br>bring everything into the tourism market<br>space you've got internal context<br>external context and we've got on the<br>one side give to the travel is that<br>they've got needs and wants and they<br>would like service five and on the other<br>side it could a tourism industry and the<br>ecosystem that is trying to satisfy<br>those things and the middle we have got<br>distributors we've got social media end<br>you've got connected devices that that<br>basically doing the bridging between the<br>two and I think it's critical to the<br>same town can do that in a way that is<br>smart smart does not mean technology<br>necessary<br>it means technology of course with all<br>the tubes of the code but also people<br>and illiteracy and if you really ask me<br>what's the most important thing about<br>smartness I will say it does it because<br>you can do a lot of things with little<br>technology for one don't you understand<br>what you're trying to do if you have<br>technology you don't necessarily do the<br>right thing but if you have literacy you<br>do the right thing and you develop the<br>technology then you're going to get an<br>economic actor social actors and<br>technological artists to create the<br>ecosystem that develops value for all<br>the stakeholders and as a result of that<br>you bring all kind of innovations in<br>terms of smart ability governments<br>economy smart people smart living smart<br>environments and then based on that<br>you're creating smarter destinations<br>with the success of destination and you<br>can see a lot of those things I'm giving<br>you a lot of reference from publications<br>because I cannot really explain<br>everything for each of these papers but<br>they created it<br>really enables us to bring together the<br>most critical factor so you can explore<br>that in in the destinations ultimately<br>you've got the smart tourism framework<br>we have on the one side you've got the<br>tooling suppliers that they're<br>generating big data constantly that goes<br>up to the cloud in terms of technology<br>and then we're working with value<br>aggregates to create a storm of value<br>that comes down to consumers which then<br>create extra extra feedback into the<br>process and then the system goes around<br>the beauty of that is that this can<br>happen very very quickly<br>because if you really think about the<br>intuition we've always been doing this<br>but what is new is the speed that we<br>operating the framework and you can put<br>something in the marketplace and you can<br>look into what is the situation in the<br>marketplace and then create propositions<br>value propositions and then the<br>consumers may like them or not like that<br>and then that feedback if it's<br>successful you bring more of that if<br>it's not you take something else in the<br>cogut context what's happening here is<br>that we really need to understand which<br>suppliers will be available and safe for<br>consumers to go and also going ready<br>meet understand in real time how the<br>situation is changing if you have after<br>a few a few days in I hope this is not<br>the case a second epidemic as a second<br>wave of the of the epidemic coming in<br>then we need to know where that is<br>happening why it's happening and then<br>and then move people to different<br>destinations if they've got boogies so<br>it's all about coordinating the whole<br>system the whole ecosystem together with<br>technology understanding what is the<br>real context in real time in taking and<br>and supported decision making<br>on the go and that's really very<br>interesting so when you are looking to<br>now nest you really look into real-time<br>info<br>location-based mentions hashtags<br>sentiments trending topics keywords<br>competitors all kind of things and by<br>looking at all of those things in real<br>time you're creating a virtual picture<br>of one's company destination and what's<br>the best course of action for each they<br>corner with this nation this brings<br>together businesses governments<br>consumers employees and those groups<br>local residents even robots and machines<br>eventually they'll be talking to each<br>other to understand what's happening<br>much until you're driving a car and the<br>car is going through a flooded area and<br>says immediately to the car that's<br>coming behind look I'm going through<br>this patch of water here please slow<br>down<br>because because it's quite dangerous to<br>drive in in that kind of speed so you<br>can see how the whole system operates<br>together by using all this information<br>in real time yes which could make just<br>for insertion crass<br>attendees if they've got any questions<br>please use the question answer function<br>and he's use the answer the question<br>lands function of and we can answer<br>questions at the end<br>so if eventually would be of course<br>you've got the whole range of new and<br>naveen technologies that they're coming<br>out that they're propelling innovations<br>in the marketplace and then what's<br>happening is that we've got on the<br>supply side than they once said the<br>customer service technology like reality<br>for many eyes the location-based<br>services of tollens devices that they're<br>all Heric maximizing the value for the<br>stakeholders in in in the marketplace so<br>technology gives us the opportunity to<br>achieve things to achieve innovations<br>and innovation so bringing the value in<br>the marketplace and when we are talking<br>about normos we normally have a car some<br>kind of trigger real time triggers<br>something's happening that actually<br>generates an event he may be<br>some users generated content maybe<br>keywords maybe something so in my case<br>they took some pictures and I put them<br>on on my social media and I said look<br>this was happening in Bournemouth today<br>there is no social distancing against<br>the government advice and I find that<br>really dangerous a destination<br>management organization should have<br>picked that up and Sue them Russ to the<br>to the to the place either with police<br>or or whatever whatever tools they've<br>got you know whatever structures they<br>actually advise people that what they<br>are doing was unwise and they're going<br>to put themselves and others in danger<br>immediately co-creation which is coming<br>into place through Nam is coming to<br>place of co-creation data-driven<br>consumer centricity because we<br>understand what the consumer wants where<br>they consumer needed in real time and<br>and we encourage the experience<br>technology eventually we enable us to<br>incomes the experience and create more<br>value in real time for everybody from<br>the ecosystem not only for the customers<br>but also value for the bronze and value<br>for potential customers and also for the<br>local population the residents and<br>everybody else we support I'll conclude<br>with a few words on ambient intelligence<br>and um be intelligence is the next the<br>next bit of the earth which really<br>introduces smart systems to everyday<br>life and everyday environment to propel<br>interconnectivity interoperability<br>through vehicles and devices through the<br>in terms of everything<br>ambient agent means that everything is<br>connected and everything is is monitored<br>and it it's optimized so you've got<br>technical developments including<br>artificial intelligence machine learning<br>ambient connectivity through web wide<br>area and 5g and autonomous vehicles and<br>robots coming together to create smart<br>solutions and smart value that is then<br>being<br>boost in the in the industry through<br>interconnected environments in<br>marketplaces I think this is<br>revolutionary because it's based on<br>artificial intelligence is based on<br>machines understanding what different<br>stakeholders need and take appropriate<br>action to actually get those machines<br>get get this value by by maximizing the<br>optimizing grab the resources but we<br>have a destination and you can see more<br>on this paper where it's grabbing so it<br>brings together the internal things they<br>love everything 5g and eventually 6g and<br>so on verified the mobile devices<br>applications cryptocurrency sensors it<br>becomes pervasive computer gamification<br>and artificial intelligence and machine<br>learning it brings everything together<br>towards co-creating experiences and<br>ultimately enable us to showcase by you<br>protect people in the coffee dinner but<br>also and maybe a pleasurable experiences<br>and add value into them I think the<br>future is marked and the future is<br>bright and those people who understand<br>the tools that we've got coming forward<br>they'll take they take good advantage<br>and also they'll take good care of their<br>resources and the value that they<br>co-create I've covered a lot of material<br>very fast these are the references on<br>the recesses will be doing on these<br>things and and I very much hope that you<br>will have the opportunity to to have a<br>look on those things<br>and we cannot hear you your microphone<br>is muted Thank You Jimmy trees for a<br>well-informed in-depth smart and also<br>very practical presentation of what<br>destinations can do from a technology<br>perspective to be smart thank you very<br>much and what I'd like to do now just<br>mister Jason is to take some questions<br>so just to remind panelists and<br>participants you've got a question just<br>put it into the into the question answer<br>slot and we will do that one question<br>that come up is Dmytro Street to you<br>what's the best example of a destination<br>that's actually got it right but I don't<br>think of any destination have actually<br>gone all the way quite typically Asian<br>Asian countries are very good in smart<br>because they're collecting a lot of data<br>big data so China is collecting all feel<br>of dayton's<br>and is really very good the data mining<br>Korea I've seen examples where they've<br>got 30,000 cameras in sale and they're<br>constantly looking everything back into<br>the system I don't think that anybody<br>has actually developed as such a<br>sophisticated kind of coordinated system<br>other than security services and defense<br>defense services in tourism I don't<br>think we've seen anything like that but<br>if you see NCIS and you see some of<br>those guys where you can see how they've<br>got access to all the information all<br>the data in real time they're collecting<br>they make decisions very quickly this is<br>a level of interoperability and<br>interconnectivity of different systems<br>and data that that we see and I don't<br>think that anybody has actually done<br>anything to my destination destinations<br>have done different good things in<br>tourism technology but I cannot really<br>single out one<br>everything perfectly and sorry I've got<br>a question um I've got a question here<br>just read the question and I'll just<br>read the question back and sorry I'll do<br>a top level questions top level question<br>the our Minister of Tourism is Kelvin<br>Davis and if you were to have a<br>one-to-one with him what would your<br>advice be I'm not gonna go off my you<br>know and advice I've done that many<br>cases my parry but but I think the most<br>important things is and and in it its<br>destination you really need to start<br>from a strategy because technology you<br>start from what you would like to<br>achieve so if I meet your Minister I'll<br>say look are you taking advantage of the<br>tools that they are variability and it's<br>your industry working together in<br>coordination and have they got the<br>infrastructure to be able to co-create<br>value for everybody<br>maximize the positive impacts for the<br>destination minimize the negative<br>impacts make sure their practices<br>they've got completely competitive and<br>so if I was to meet your Minister I'll<br>ask a lot of questions before I educate<br>myself and then perhaps with colleagues<br>locally to question he ever won from one<br>of the participants and if the tourist<br>or destination leader has access to<br>better information and informed informed<br>information do they really care<br>does it change that behavior does it<br>change that decisions yes absolutely<br>because because the information actually<br>leads them to do things and in the past<br>Therese was is really about following<br>the yellow umbrella but I don't think<br>that a lot of people are very keen to<br>follow the yellow umbrella anymore to<br>have the vanilla flavor to guy that says<br>everything can I say something which I<br>normally say to do a lot of the<br>presentation without your knowledge for<br>me I keep saying that you know all tools<br>that we've done together in China and<br>several other places you quite often<br>employ a tube guide but with a<br>photographer to guide because this<br>particular person will give you much<br>more value for what you would like to<br>get out of this particular destination<br>and you pay this tour guide probably six<br>to ten times more than the normal guy<br>attractions so personalization<br>contextualization visualization which is<br>based on what the customer needs in dec<br>we bring us to the new situation where<br>we could create value for everybody so<br>Ian gets to get the best fixes and gives<br>but very good value by looking to doing<br>his hobby the local photographer guy is<br>getting ten times more than he would<br>because out of the beaten track and he<br>is buying a coke he's buying a sandwich<br>or whatever and then when he and so is<br>the key speaks is to say wow this is<br>wonderful I like to go there and I can<br>say a lot of examples from different<br>people have got different English<br>because the yellow umbrella kind of -<br>I'm following and following the leader<br>is kind of and got a question here and<br>if you're a DM or and you looking to me<br>imagine where do you start<br>what should the main focus be this is<br>everything I've got this I'd get this<br>question quite a lot and I was doing a<br>presentation some years back in in the<br>destination where the local mayor came<br>along and said I'm really enthusiastic<br>about can i buy it tomorrow where do I<br>buy it how long does it take to install<br>it but I'm not selling a system it's not<br>the system that is going it's a<br>different way of thinking into strategy<br>it's bringing a lot of systems together<br>and actually bringing the the strategic<br>thinking of people to come together and<br>integrate a lot of the existing data a<br>lot of the existing systems towards<br>maximizing the value for the<br>stakeholders so where do you start I<br>would start from your strategic<br>objectives what were you trying to<br>achieve if you are trying to what what<br>is what is your strategy what what are<br>you trying to achieve in the destination<br>cycle I try to make sure that they do<br>not maximize the number of travelers who<br>they are tracking but then maximize the<br>positive impact from the travelers that<br>they attract so depending where you are<br>with your constrains with your resources<br>what you're doing you know what's your<br>flows materialize do all of those things<br>need to be taken to consideration<br>creating a strategy where you're using<br>technology to maximize the benefits for<br>all the stakeholders the vengo it's not<br>easy but it's a it's a it's a paradigm<br>shift it's a different way of thinking<br>about things and the tools fluid because<br>if the tools are are moving they're<br>changing some years ago we're using pure<br>codes now we're using RFID you know<br>tomorrow we'll use something else it<br>doesn't matter what<br>is that you are able to access<br>information and what is the value what<br>is the benefit of of using this<br>technology this is really what what<br>really needs to you really need to think<br>towards achieving your objectives and<br>what you're proposing what you've talked<br>about today and make may work in a city<br>destination or an urban center be more<br>effective but New Zealand fundamentally<br>in the terms of experience and product<br>is more rural you know for example we<br>take our south south island and once so<br>how does what you say today change it in<br>a rural perspective in the terms of<br>strategy technology okay small tourism<br>is primarily come out from smart cities<br>and really about managing urban<br>environments with many people same thing<br>so if you can think about the farm in a<br>rural area that specializing other main<br>courses and creating a storytelling<br>about courses and create a bubble of<br>interest anybody about courses that they<br>would like to go to that farm riding or<br>look looking after the horses the whole<br>thing should actually create value<br>around and then let's say that 20<br>kilometres down the road there's another<br>farm and another city in another village<br>that it's also doing course so you can<br>do the course you know going around<br>perhaps otherwise you can even ride<br>horses instead of instead of heavy car<br>hire the same thing with bikes the same<br>thing with everything it's it's not<br>about sicknesses about looking to<br>resources and connecting the right<br>resources to the right customers I used<br>to I used to some years ago I used to<br>write and go into different places in<br>ways and<br>it happened two or three times that I<br>arrived in my little cottage where I<br>stayed the night and the lady of the<br>house said look I'll just cook this cake<br>would you like to have some cake<br>and I love their waste cakes imagine<br>that I was going around and a lady<br>because was putting on and I've said<br>look-alike waste cakes and the lady of<br>the house has actually put on social<br>media I've just cooked this nice cake I<br>I go and stay in that little place with<br>the lady of the house we scoop the cake<br>rather than going to the big brother cut<br>them that can be the same so what I'm<br>trying to explain is that is that it's<br>not it's really about bringing<br>connecting people connecting resources<br>connecting all the different kind of<br>aspects in real time how do you think<br>see over nineteen changes how we used<br>how we use technology in many countries<br>like Greece Italy in Spain where people<br>were locked in for 3-4 months they had<br>to do a lot of university lecturers<br>we've never ever ever done a single<br>online lectures they had to become<br>prolific in about one week and there was<br>not the question of I can do it or I<br>cannot do it everybody had to do it and<br>as you can see we relied on ization them<br>to actually connect and operate and<br>function and I think that almost told<br>customers and everybody else that we are<br>in a place of no return when we go to<br>the next the new reality the new reality<br>will be almost blended<br>because the fact of the matter is I've<br>never been to New Zealand but I'd love<br>to go to New Zealand but if I have two<br>weeks to do New Zealand where should<br>they go can I do to in advance and then<br>kind of decide what kind of thing I know<br>what's going to happen eventually I'll<br>call you and say look made of got two<br>weeks what they do but that but in<br>reality what you'd like to have is and<br>we are going to go to blended realities<br>and an expectation that all the local<br>information especially with covalent and<br>special and safety to know a be and has<br>got ability to deal with things and I<br>know that you're in a very universe<br>fortunate situation New Zealand a 6,000<br>people I've done so I really want to<br>understand you know in Bournemouth for<br>example where I'm looking<br>where can I go and I can have social<br>distancing because what they experienced<br>today I don't really want to go into<br>that place again and invades of myself<br>how can I respond to some experience<br>without me endangering others and always<br>so how examples of how technology is<br>being used to help us manage and you<br>know capacities and businesses so I'll<br>give you an example free corporate 19<br>and the keywords in tourism is Alma<br>tourism and as we now rush back to those<br>beaches and for example social<br>distancing becomes an issue how can we<br>use technology to help us manage those<br>capacities and in terms of distance<br>as you know and there is no such thing<br>as over tours over tourism it is it's a<br>media creation which I hate it's badly<br>managed to burn in London but limits<br>they're the places where current<br>capacity has been exceeded and the<br>places where tourism has actually done<br>bad for the nation in terms of impact<br>because because those who are decision<br>makers make the wrong decisions and then<br>control their stress what the situation<br>is that in destinations you can have its<br>predictable people do not happen you<br>know they were telling me about<br>Santorini and they said look when three<br>cruise liners are appearing at the same<br>time the situation is impossible and I<br>said okay but why three cruise liners<br>appear at the same time who is giving<br>them the permission to appear at the<br>same time why do you say that that's the<br>problem they would tell me you know I<br>arrived in London some time ago and took<br>me two and a half hours to get out of<br>the airport and they told me look it's<br>early in the morning and they only have<br>to security you know police officers<br>well taking passports and I said look<br>three bigger planes arrived at the same<br>time bringing one thousand one thousand<br>passengers right it's not not the planes<br>arrived from where this was planned<br>months ago the fact that you only have<br>two people to manage 1000 1000<br>passengers it's bad planning it's bad<br>management it's not it's not the fact<br>that look there's so many people coming<br>it's it's destinations and the tourism<br>business and organizations that they do<br>not take care of their business and they<br>do not really manage tourism well and<br>this is this will become unacceptable<br>future because maybe we expect that<br>we're gonna do tourism the right way<br>and also people expect they do not go<br>back and they say they'll Park Methodist<br>on a destination that is not providing<br>value for them and it's not really after<br>and this where technology is coming into<br>supporting competitive advantage for<br>destinations I say look I I didn't have<br>to go through passport and and security<br>controls because all my information was<br>no they did face recognition I went<br>through out of the Year five minutes<br>thank you very much goodbye that was a<br>good experience so it's all kind of have<br>to add value to consumers as they're<br>going through the different stages but<br>also not only to consumers but also the<br>local population going back to your<br>areas can you imagine how much money you<br>can bring to those people that they need<br>most in every situation in every context<br>by actually telling them telling the<br>world about the fantastic ad Jake this<br>lady was doing and him here your name<br>was Claire connection human human human<br>thoughts and just a question could you<br>tell us a story with examples of say for<br>example how a visitor attraction and<br>I'll use the example of Walt Disney<br>because it's about it's about big<br>numbers and it's a new closeness of how<br>they could use this technology in a post<br>call back 19 world Disney is probably<br>the most the smartest destination in the<br>world because its total control of me<br>they control everything they control how<br>many people are going through so in<br>Disneyland Disneyland Paris they take<br>45,000 people they know that after<br>35,000 people to reach their current<br>capacity and what they do is they they<br>kind of warn people and when<br>rates for 5000 they close the doors they<br>say we cannot take any more they know<br>what is the queueing that the queues<br>that they've got in its attraction so if<br>in its in some attractions they've got<br>more than half an hour they do something<br>if they've got more than one hour Mickey<br>comes out and some creeks so signs of<br>you a few autographs does a few things<br>if it's more than two hours are queuing<br>they are bringing out the train and said<br>look you don't really want to wait here<br>for twelve because we know that you're<br>gonna have a bad experience you wait for<br>two hours to do it then half a minute<br>attraction right so they they go out<br>there with a little van and they say let<br>me take you to a bit of the village that<br>is less busy oh they do priority things<br>so they give they give they say extra<br>extra priority passes to go faster so<br>once you understand the issue what the<br>customer wants and what your constraints<br>you tell pygmy you tell people not<br>arrive here at 11 o'clock so you can<br>have a bit experience and if you know if<br>you predict total day 14 to focus you<br>will have so many people then you extend<br>the way that you don't close at 6 or 7<br>o'clock you go up to 8 or 9 o'clock so<br>you increase the capacity because you<br>control the distillation in some normal<br>destinations more difficult to do that<br>but there are also ways of doing it<br>Bhutan for example has got a very<br>expensive dessert just just slow down if<br>I remember well it's a $5,000 just to<br>make sure that they controlling who is<br>going there but they those people who go<br>there they contribute to the place so<br>there are lot of techniques to do<br>depending on on the destination<br>depending on the resources and<br>dependability of their sources because<br>this is what we're trying to do also<br>sustainability of valuable resources<br>just one final question to close and in<br>a considering postcode at nineteen world<br>which technologies do you think will<br>accelerate and become more prominent and<br>technology create so if if a particular<br>I don't know<br>Bluetooth some some of you may remember<br>work on the mobile phones the first the<br>first incremental mobile phones it<br>disappeared but quickly the next the<br>next level of came forward so it doesn't<br>matter really which technology is going<br>to take smartness forward because it's<br>it's all this ambient technologies and<br>all these ambient agents are coming<br>together complementing each other and<br>developing value for the future but if I<br>have to choose one I think this<br>intelligence where the machines decide<br>for themselves and the machines decide<br>for themselves based on machine learning<br>and what they learn from your experience<br>and your behavior in the last place and<br>and engaging in mathematical formulas<br>and mathematical calculations to predict<br>what you need so before you start<br>looking so when you book your you're<br>when you book your your flight here<br>instead of you looking for the best<br>immediately the system brings three<br>photographers to you and say look and I<br>know that you are normally looking for<br>photography guides here the three best<br>people with the best views in this<br>particular area and I know that you<br>would like to take pixels with slow<br>speeds and stuff like that this<br>particular person five reviews that they<br>are mentioning that so we are matching<br>your needs your requirements with the<br>skills of this particular individual<br>proactively before actually you do it<br>because for the time being you need to<br>think about look around and and find<br>increasingly what's gonna happen is the<br>information will find you you'll not be<br>again give me to yourself Demetrius<br>thank you very much that was a a well<br>informed presentation really thick<br>discussion and both were strong on<br>research but also some practical advice<br>in terms of questions for destinations<br>and just before we go I'd like to remind<br>participants of our forthcoming and our<br>fourth cook coming over our forthcoming<br>M seminars and the next one will be on<br>the 9th of July where we are going to<br>look at destination recovery strategies<br>basically what destinations have done<br>lessons learnt and what next and we have<br>three leaders we have Stephen England<br>hall from tourism New Zealand we have<br>middle brand from visit Scotland and we<br>have Donna Kieren from the new york<br>company so three different destinations<br>at three different straight stages<br>within the crisis of core we're 19 and<br>that's on the 9th of July then on the<br>22nd of July we were looking at pricing<br>and forecasting in a post call at 19<br>world with sherry claims from Cornell<br>Cornell University and Ben Vinod from<br>said server technologies so thank you<br>very much and it's just to remind people<br>to have a good day this this recording<br>what we posted onto YouTube in the next<br>couple of days and we'll inform you of<br>that channel so thank you very much and<br>to Demetrius it's thank you and good<br>night thank you thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
