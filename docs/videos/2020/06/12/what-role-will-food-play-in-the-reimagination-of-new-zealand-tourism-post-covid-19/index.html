As we emerge from the aftermath of COVID-19, what will the role of food and wine be in the re-imagination of New Zealand tourism? Will food tourism allow us to reconnect with our friends and families through the regions of New Zealand, or will food tourism just be for the “foodies” who can afford luxury experiences? Will food festivals disappear in response to the limitations on mass gatherings?

food<br>truisms moment in New Zealand Sun each<br>speaker is going to be speaking for<br>about ten minutes and then there will be<br>time for moderated questions you can ask<br>questions as we go through although<br>believe those answering those until the<br>end and to do that you just use the Q&amp;A<br>on your at the top or the bottom of your<br>zoom and screen and once questions<br>started to start to appear you can also<br>vote others questions and I'll draw from<br>those when we come back to the speakers<br>at the end so without no further ado I'm<br>going to pass on to our first speaker<br>and Ian yeoman who's gonna explore some<br>of the exciting food tourism trends pure<br>Ian thank you Karen without doubt<br>there's two different worlds today there<br>was a world prior to Corbett 19 others<br>world a and as Paul at 19 has been a<br>disruptor on all types of businesses<br>whether in whether you food tourism or<br>manufacturing is no doubt about that so<br>the question asks how does food tourism<br>change and of course call that the world<br>and that's the purpose of today's of<br>sorry Ian we've actually lost you I<br>think you've gone on to meet me so I'll<br>just that you're neutered yet that<br>that's fine<br>okay that's fine sorry and the key<br>question to ask is what is resilience<br>and resilience is a good way to test the<br>depth of a train and how all change in<br>what is impact and here I talk on a<br>framework which uses an Albert postman's<br>at nineteen and Jim James getting as<br>work on alternative interest well we<br>talk about what is the impact of change<br>in terms of recession what is the nature<br>of the change in where the focuses so<br>that's what I'm going to talk about and<br>put this into a framework next slide<br>please<br>so what if what if food tourism changes<br>what would that world look like what<br>what the Fest will be only a trend green<br>and the terms of growing board it's the<br>degree of change I want to consider X<br>like what<br>what I'm going to look at is the piece<br>we mark the stages of Corvette 19 when<br>it first began so when it disappears for<br>scenario four scenarios will refrain<br>would collapse and decline represents<br>the end of tourism transition means all<br>the nineteenth year the colony the<br>present situation around level<br>transformation thinking about a better<br>world thinking about a better future or<br>a revival world about celebration<br>because we're out of it completely and<br>it's getting back trying to get back to<br>normal next slide please<br>so what I'm going to talk about is orbit<br>nineteen is here it takes us back to<br>basics when we talk about pasture basics<br>one of the cool things to look at is my<br>muscles hierarchy of needs sense of<br>security<br>the sense of safety psychological means<br>of water rest because went back to<br>basics we'll call it nineteen arrived<br>wasn't about economic well-being it<br>wasn't about getting out from doing<br>things it was about it was about you and<br>me and our relationship with friends and<br>family and what was fired so from a<br>tourism perspective next slide please<br>what we saw in here was basically we saw<br>the collapse of tourism there was no<br>tourism across the world we saw all<br>major events gatherings of more than two<br>or three people they were just banned<br>they just they just didn't they just<br>didn't happen because it was against the<br>health and advice of your government<br>tourism stopped elapsed and decline next<br>slide please<br>some of the trends that came out of that<br>in the terms of how we felt in this<br>world of basicness in the world of<br>simplicity is safety became really<br>important hygiene became really<br>important it was right at the top of<br>your conversation way the other concept<br>that came out was the sense of distance<br>social distancing or Shore harness and<br>some of the things that are coming out<br>of this in terms of trends have become<br>more important for example will be about<br>labor supply on all automation because<br>when we're in this world<br>of transition COV maintenance yeah Skiba<br>19 is around us live in a different<br>world so the world of level 2 or level 3<br>we're aware of all the virus and how in<br>managing so automation becomes important<br>technology becomes important as that and<br>they're the substitute next slide please<br>and at the same time what comes out of<br>this basic needs out our thinking about<br>our value systems changes it's going<br>back to basics it's a world of<br>simplicity value meeting locals lots of<br>free time and bargains<br>I want attitude to life is the bond to a<br>process of rethinking and what's<br>important to us how we talking about it<br>that's the present sense of where we are<br>and how we connect and I think what I'm<br>a calling stuff is one pound so what<br>does it mean if we have a revival of<br>transformation next slide please<br>so revival revival and transformation<br>takes us further about hierarchy of<br>needs psychological needs around<br>belongingness and low so these questions<br>do you know it's about intimate<br>relationship with friends and family<br>it's about us and society so examples of<br>this it's about what doomed from tourism<br>perspective and that relationship next<br>slide please<br>so let us think about how food takes us<br>into that different world here it's the<br>world of social responsibility thinking<br>about others and from a food tourism<br>perspective almost have a strong<br>connection about what could have come we<br>use food as means of society and a<br>classical example of that is the clink<br>restaurants in London and the click<br>restaurants in London or restaurants run<br>by the prisoners it's aware that we give<br>birth where celebrity chefs and chefs<br>come in and they<br>help and they become they were a<br>restaurant which are about betterness<br>about helping people and we engage with<br>next slide please<br>what happens if it's about revival but<br>the trend that happens in this revival<br>is the trend of fluid identity this<br>takes us back to pre Corbett 19 this<br>takes us a world where corporate 19 is<br>disappeared and we just want to get back<br>to normal and fluid identity as a<br>concert my food tourism spective it's<br>not about a foodie or a gastro tourist I<br>was interested in this is the average<br>tools this is the tourist that was to<br>Wellington on a plate and from my<br>perspective they want a sample they want<br>something new it wants an experience<br>they're not but the one to be excited<br>they want that novelty so the trip<br>willing to try something different a lot<br>more heading on hedonic in the terms of<br>that food tourism train XY please so<br>it's about challenging one of the<br>questions have got to ask in this<br>revival world is what is the war of<br>science and how can science that I would<br>science contribute so a couple of<br>examples from science are about you to<br>know what you can buy from any<br>supermarket or dairy or tomorrow milk<br>this is about and reshaping a tourism<br>product in a natural way so to focus on<br>certain elements are around better diet<br>it's about high value so it's asking the<br>question what would that tourists pay<br>more for what do they see in the terms<br>of that added value and it's about<br>putting science into into food and his<br>perspective on tourism so reshaping a<br>product or an experience that's tying<br>down next slide please<br>and looking at that one of the other<br>things that we think about science in<br>science and that change is about talk<br>about seasonality and the terms of when<br>to eat something and when not to eat<br>when it's in season in the price but<br>what happens in seasonality to test in<br>seasonality at the right time to kill a<br>cow or to kill a sheep for us to eat how<br>does gender affect or change the taste<br>of the food so looking at looking at<br>seasonality and food beyond when it<br>becomes available<br>but looking at from a taste perspective<br>as an example of this I will try<br>something new bringing science in the me<br>Lex and when enjoy my plate is the<br>world's more successful food festival in<br>my eyes so as a consequence of that next<br>slide please<br>it's about brisbane bringing businesses<br>alone we know about Wellington and its<br>burgers so what about in 2030 that<br>McDonald's wins Wellington on open<br>restaurants of the year it's something<br>new they just want to be part of that<br>chain and actually it's it's happened<br>and McDonald's have done pop-up<br>restaurants with the theme restaurant em<br>and they've done that and talk to your<br>best so m-make slide please<br>that's me quick all of you or food<br>trends and how they shame thank you<br>Thank You Ian for giving us some<br>thought-provoking introductions to some<br>of the features we might look at in<br>terms of food tourism so I'm not going<br>to pass on to dr. Joanna fountain and<br>he's going to explore the potential of<br>food in tourism experiences Joe welcome<br>Joe you've got your mute on so let's<br>just hold on a moment there we go<br>I had unmuted myself but unfortunately I<br>got rebooted so thank you for your<br>introduction Karen and for Ian for your<br>your your opening presentation as always<br>it's really interesting to to see inside<br>your mind and think about how you're<br>seeing the future<br>how can you please move to the next<br>slide Karen so um I think probably we<br>don't need to go through this except to<br>say that for the last 20 years I've been<br>doing research on food wine and Agri<br>tourism I started being a wine tourism<br>researcher particularly are doing<br>participant observation of wine tourism<br>which really meant going to wineries a<br>lot but since then I've moved into<br>looking at food tourism but also working<br>with farmers beef and sheep farmers in<br>North Canterbury looking at Agri tourism<br>options next slide please so what I<br>wanted to do today briefly is just talk<br>about some of the trends influencing<br>opportunities as we see them firstly<br>talk obviously we're in a context where<br>most tourism is domestic and will be for<br>the foreseeable future<br>Ian had a presentation a couple of times<br>ago around economic recession and the<br>impact of that on tourist behavior and I<br>want to also talk about add to that by<br>talking a little bit about what I've<br>described as the post locked-down<br>zeitgeist next slide please<br>so um obviously in this domestic context<br>we are talking a lot about pivoting<br>towards domestic but in this domestic<br>context and presented a newsroom opinion<br>piece a month or so ago where he looked<br>at what were some of the trends that we<br>can see happening in an environment<br>where postcode would 19 there will be a<br>recession and so I'm not going to go<br>into too much detail about that but just<br>I do want to acknowledge that really it<br>was Ian who was my starting point for<br>thinking along this lines slide please<br>so what I've done is I've taken some of<br>the ideas that in prison<br>and then connected them up with what<br>I've described as a postcode like ghost<br>and there was this article that I was<br>published a few days ago but I came<br>across it yesterday and from The<br>Guardian looking at what New Zealand has<br>read readers felt they would like to see<br>change in their world post covert and<br>well we have to acknowledge that New<br>Zealand readers of The Guardian may not<br>be a represented a representative sample<br>of New Zealanders I feel that some of<br>the quotations from their article I hope<br>to illustrate points I'm going to make<br>next slide please so bringing together<br>the two sets of information the<br>information or the the trends around<br>what happens in a recession with the<br>trends around the kind of post post<br>covert attitude or zeitgeist we are<br>experiencing I want to look at each of<br>these together so the first one is ian<br>has already talked today about the<br>importance of connecting with roots so<br>in a recession and friends and family<br>are seen as being more important I'm<br>connecting with the people we love and<br>of course in a in in in our experience<br>post lockdown not only have we spent a<br>lot of time with family but we've also<br>become acutely aware of those friends<br>and family members who are not near us<br>and so and in this environment I think<br>many of us are really wanting to connect<br>with our friends connect with our<br>families but at the same time there have<br>been other elements of our roots and<br>identity that have come to the floor as<br>well and so I think this might be a time<br>when we do want to continue with some of<br>that family time I think many of us were<br>very excited when our children went back<br>to school but there were things about<br>the lockdown and having our kids at home<br>with us 24/7 it were actually kind of<br>nice you know having time talking to<br>them and going for walks with them<br>looking at the but I think there are<br>other elements of roots as well so<br>genealogical roots thinking about our<br>ancestry but also connecting through to<br>a natural and cultural heritage so what<br>is it about being a New Zealander what<br>is it about being in this place that may<br>a special and the place special next<br>um another trend that Ian noticed or<br>described was this idea about simplicity<br>there in a post in a recession<br>environment there is a search for slow<br>for value based holidays for three times<br>for bargains but spending time visiting<br>friends and relatives because you can<br>sleep on the couch for free those sort<br>of issues around simplicity and the<br>search of form slow experiences again<br>and the post covert like guys I think<br>you can talk about that in terms of also<br>I think many of us have really<br>appreciated valuing our time and taking<br>time to do things so I often talk about<br>the fact that during lockdown there was<br>a shortage of flour and yeast but there<br>was still bread on the shelves we<br>weren't buying yeast and flowers because<br>we needed to bake it was because we<br>wanted to bake and and I think their<br>enjoyment of slow activities slowed<br>tourism slow travel walking cycling and<br>bring in South slow food maybe some of<br>those elements that continued there's a<br>couple of quotations there from The<br>Guardian article which illustrate that<br>point next slide please<br>and I think another element of the<br>slowness has been that connection with<br>nature and so many people have talked<br>about the joy at seeing P Walker Walker<br>everywhere I think the P Walker Walker<br>is if it hasn't if it's not the<br>frontrunner for bird of the year I don't<br>know what it is but it really has been<br>quite a symbol for this slow times in<br>the bird life so connecting with nature<br>but learning about nature and sort of<br>also I think a sense of nostalgia for<br>the way things used to be you know it<br>used to always be quiet you could walk<br>down the street and so on next slide and<br>then the final point that bringing<br>together<br>Ian's typology with some of the postcode<br>bird trends is this indication that<br>there will be more people staying at<br>home for breaks or vacations or having<br>short breaks rather than going on long<br>holidays now that will be partly<br>financial but it may also be a part of<br>the new ways of working so there's talk<br>about going to four-day working weeks<br>which does give you those long weekends<br>more often perhaps to get away um but<br>there's also been a real strength and a<br>pride in being part of this theme of<br>five million so the first day of<br>lockdown I went out for a walk and I<br>couldn't believe how many New Zealand<br>flags were flying outside the houses of<br>my subject at a level not normally see<br>on this is an all black mismatch but you<br>know people were really proud about<br>their heritage you hit the teddy bear<br>hunt so a lot of issues around community<br>and pride in being all in this together<br>next slide Thanks<br>so in terms of opportunities for food<br>and drink tourism I think there are<br>opportunities to connect to people to<br>heritage to places to socialize by<br>sharing food and drink we know that<br>sharing food and drink is such a part of<br>hospitality or menarche Tonga to learn<br>and also to pass on learning to new<br>generations so new skills maybe cooking<br>skills maybe gardening skills having new<br>food and drink experiences and<br>developing new cultural understandings<br>and a final set of options around<br>opportunities to support local<br>businesses and local communities so<br>carrying on from our lockdown experience<br>there's a lot of energy around buying<br>local shopping local supporting our<br>communities so all of these things can<br>be combined in memorable experiences<br>they offer inclusive rather than<br>exclusive food experiences as well next<br>slide please<br>what demand might there be amongst the<br>mystic visitors it's all very well<br>coming up with these grand schemes and<br>scenarios but is there any evidence that<br>domestic you'd be interested in these<br>kinds of experiences well fortunately<br>last year I did a couple of surveys<br>where we did have a set of questions in<br>them about potential activities that<br>could be available in this town and<br>whether domestic visitors would be<br>interested in participating in them so<br>the two towns with coca-cola and up<br>arrived they're not massive sample sizes<br>it was part of an international study<br>but we had 124 domestic visitors who<br>when asked how appealing the various<br>activities were and rated them either<br>extremely appealing or quite appealing I<br>think a couple of things on that stand<br>out in this context one is a food tour<br>around the region so 21 percent of<br>domestic visitors thought a food tour<br>would be extremely appealing and a<br>further 46 percent thought it would be<br>quite appealing and I think the other<br>point I really want to point out there<br>is the interest in Maori cultural<br>tourism I did some research on domestic<br>interests in Maori tourism 15 years ago<br>and you were looking at maybe 2 to 5<br>percent of domestic visitors thought<br>that during a tourist experience they<br>would want a Maori cultural experience<br>the figures now is 18 percent of<br>domestic<br>visitors in kaikoura thought maori<br>cultural experience would be extremely<br>appealing and close to 2/3 thought it<br>would be at least appealing to some<br>extent next slide please<br>so more recently in October 2019 that<br>other survey was January February 2019<br>this is October 2019 it's a smaller<br>sample again this is a sample of<br>visitors from outside banks peninsula<br>who were at the a Corolla French fest so<br>obviously people who are interested in<br>heritage to some extent so we're going<br>to summer a list of questions<br>the additional categories were ones that<br>kind of suited the region or were asked<br>for by stakeholders but here we had two<br>particularly related around food so a<br>food tour of producers in the region 34%<br>said that would be extremely appealing<br>and that is not a typo 62 further<br>percent sixty-three percent said it<br>would be quite or slightly appealing but<br>that's right up to 97 percent saw a food<br>tour as appealing I did go back and<br>check those burgers because they seemed<br>very high but the other one there is a<br>food foraging tour you know you're<br>looking at 85 percent thought a food for<br>a foraging tour could be interesting so<br>and again just repeating there that the<br>interest in Maori cultural experiences<br>85 percent of the sample thought it<br>would be interesting to some extent<br>okay so moving on I just about run out<br>of my time but I just wanted to talk a<br>little bit about some of the forms that<br>these experiences could take so clearly<br>I'm bringing together those kind of<br>things both in terms of what happens in<br>a recession but also bringing in a<br>postcodes post lockdown zeitgeist<br>there's lots of opportunities for<br>gardening workshops foraging tours<br>cooking classes and there are many<br>people already doing this next slide<br>please um there are also opportunities<br>for large and small operators to provide<br>food and drink experiences I want to<br>give a shout out to Terrace edge in<br>North Canterbury a winery I've been<br>visiting with my students for about<br>eight years when I first started<br>visiting visiting it it was literally<br>just a kid they have now decided to<br>invest in more<br>salad or they sell exotic toasties at<br>$11 each they have a food and wine<br>tasting plate and bringing experiences<br>that are not exclusive unto to visitors<br>to north can't agree next slide<br>and the third experience I just wanted<br>to mention is Scottie beetles Scottie<br>has a farm of sperm he has a farm in<br>North Canterbury and he's just started<br>running tours on his family farmed I've<br>had a hundred thirty years experience<br>farming there and he said the very first<br>time he had visitors out there to find<br>out about this heritage there was one<br>thing that they liked more than anything<br>else and that was being able to pick<br>peers from a hundred year old peer tree<br>and that's the peer tree there so you<br>know there are ways of incorporating<br>food and heritage into a lot of<br>experiences the final slide and we'll<br>scoot through this quite quickly I just<br>want to make the point that um it is<br>important that food experiences are not<br>just seen as expensive experiences so<br>yes you can buy a crayfish at $100 yes<br>you can go to an expensive restaurant<br>and buy a exclusive French pate next<br>slide next thing and the next one but<br>actually there are many other<br>experiences like a honey<br>my daughter experiencing her first<br>decent honey $10 per head a great<br>cultural experience in the last slide<br>and we can't forget that actually when<br>we talk about food experiences for many<br>people fish and chips on the beach or an<br>ice cream in the sunshine is a really<br>special experience so thank you very<br>much for that and I look forward to some<br>questions thank you Joe and just a<br>reminder to everyone we have got the<br>questions open we have no questions yet<br>so please somebody jump in and be the<br>first first there you just go to the Q&amp;A<br>which should be on the menu of your zoom<br>screen and type in your question there<br>and we'll be looking forward to asking<br>those to the panelists after our next<br>presentation so without further ado I'd<br>like to introduce Sarah<br>AM and welcome here to talk about food<br>tourism's moment in the new zealand sun<br>cura and tena koe so everyone can hear<br>you<br>yes sir oh that sounds great great for<br>those of you who don't know me my name<br>is zeramy Conner and the chief executive<br>of the Wellington cannery events trust<br>we're the organization behind some of<br>New Zealand's largest food and beverage<br>events including visa Wellington our<br>patient via vana I'm really delighted to<br>speak to you today so thank you to Ian<br>for inviting me to be part of the<br>session and for those of you not<br>familiar with our activities in 2019<br>they collectively resulted in 350,000<br>culinary experiences being head across<br>the month of August right across the<br>Wellington region that all said what the<br>hell just happened I don't think any of<br>us could have quite predicted where we<br>are right now back in March and in fact<br>as we went into lockdown we've literally<br>just finished the first round of visa<br>Wellington on our plate program creation<br>and we were working with festival of<br>intern and participants platforms to<br>refine their applications and then BAM<br>we everything came to a grinding halt<br>so it's certainly been a challenging few<br>months since then but we have come<br>through and yes there is still a role<br>for food festivals in this new world but<br>this times also been a bit of a<br>reflective one at the risk of sounding a<br>bit cliched I'm a big believer in<br>opportunity coming out of adversity and<br>I do believe right now that New Zealand<br>is on the precipice of an amazing<br>opportunity around food tourism so<br>whilst we've all been hunkered down<br>learning the delights of Sardo bread<br>making and the thrill of discovering<br>your local brewery was delivering as an<br>essential service B it seemed to be<br>somewhat of a dawning for many people an<br>appreciation of what was available right<br>here in little old New Zealand and since<br>we've come out the other side a lot down<br>there's been a groundswell of support of<br>things like Facebook groups endorsing by<br>New Zealand made finally we may have<br>reached the moment where our passion and<br>love for New Zealand has outweighed<br>tireless cultural cringe and Anna<br>satiable demand for all things imported<br>or to emulate the food of other<br>destinations and this is the moment we<br>can realise that we actually have the<br>best in the world right here in New<br>Zealand food is a major part of what<br>defines us as Kiwis but it doesn't get<br>the same attention as other New Zealand<br>cultural icons like bungee jumping rugby<br>or even crowded house food should be one<br>of our great cultural markers as a<br>nation just as other countries known for<br>the cuisine like France or Italy<br>in New Zealand food is intimately woven<br>into our cockerel identity an integral<br>part of what we defines us as uniquely<br>Kiwi food experiences are a connector<br>they're a community builder they're our<br>creator of shared experiences and<br>memories in food and hospitality are not<br>just about sustenance for many it's<br>about entertainment in learning about<br>our manake China New Zealand's<br>hospitality quarter our culture and who<br>we are in my brief comments today I want<br>to give you some thoughts on food<br>tourism and a practical sense what is<br>happening in New Zealand and how how we<br>harness the opportunity right now this<br>is New Zealand's food moment in the Sun<br>our audience is quite literally captive<br>there is no more time to wait the we<br>just need to nail this and nail it now<br>here's one definition of food tourism<br>from gosselin Gothenburg University and<br>it's probably visually shows why food<br>tourism is so hard to encapsulate in a<br>singular one-line definition and its<br>broadest sense food tourism isn't any<br>experience where a consumer can have a<br>taste or a taste of place of a product<br>or ingredient that reflects the<br>characteristics the terroir of a<br>destination by the summing the<br>ingredients that reflects the lands the<br>lakes the rivers oceans and skies of a<br>destination and in how its interpreted<br>either through an agritourism experience<br>pick your own operation right through to<br>a farmers market food trucks fine dining<br>an attraction that's got food and<br>beverage offerings of food festival food<br>event a culinary tour food tourism is<br>where food connects us all and we really<br>come together and understand a<br>destinations community there's society<br>in your culture it's important because<br>it contributes to the intangible<br>heritage of a destination and it's a<br>unique point of differentiation from<br>other places no two destinations are the<br>same when it comes to food it also<br>attracts visitors that spend more and<br>who's spread benefit right across the<br>whole value chain food tourism is a<br>great economic development driver for<br>lists of visitor destinations and<br>communities and it can help small scale<br>producers diversify their region create<br>lasting visitor loyalty to the place and<br>the products produced and probably most<br>significantly food tourism is widely<br>accessible food tourism isn't just the<br>foodies it's the everyone and the reason<br>I wanted to share this definition with<br>you is that food tourism is everywhere<br>and we experience elements<br>but almost everyday for the most part<br>almost every New Zealand at some time or<br>another is a food trust and Joe our<br>previous speaker alluded to this any<br>opportunities around the severe<br>presentation next slide please<br>I'm going to quickly cover and three<br>things all appropriately starting with C<br>around Co good 19 there's some big and<br>small ideas loosely around Community<br>Connection and challenges I don't think<br>I've got time today to address<br>everything there are some really big<br>issues around food with things like<br>sustainability the food system food<br>resilience food security and many other<br>things so today I'm just going to talk<br>about food tourism and some specific<br>opportunities and challenges that we<br>have next slide please<br>firstly community that's us New<br>Zealanders as consumers of food tourism<br>in my day job I think about food tourism<br>every moment when we establish these<br>Wellington on a plate we set a bold<br>vision for Wellington we want Wellington<br>to be New Zealand's most globally<br>recognized food destination we want to<br>create world-class culinary experiences<br>in Wellington we're focused on pushing<br>gastronomic boundaries and do you<br>recognize for delivering at the most<br>innovative and original colouring events<br>and festivals in the Oceania region a<br>global beach rack we are squarely<br>focused on the culinary tourism<br>experience visa Wellington on a plate<br>was initially developed in 2009 as a<br>joint venture by myself then working up<br>for our RTO in our regional economic<br>development agency to solve some very<br>real issues in Wellington we were<br>dragging our heels through the end of<br>the last recession in the winter months<br>were positively dire accommodation and<br>restaurants were really struggling not<br>only that there were so few<br>opportunities for the wider food and<br>beverage producing industry to connect<br>with one another now on 2020 we all see<br>ourselves facing a similar scenario food<br>tourism is a way to reactivate<br>communities through food that's your<br>local hospitality and restaurant<br>operators local producers and suppliers<br>and all the operators down the value<br>chain we're here today the tourism<br>sector has experienced the most profound<br>shift in focus ever from a tourism<br>economy reliant on a large nor of<br>international visitors now their focus<br>is squarely on a domestic visitor and<br>it's fair to say the motivators for<br>domestic visitors are quite different<br>traditionally aside from business travel<br>domestic visitors travel for two key<br>reasons visiting friends and relatives<br>it's aunt Carol's birthday or your<br>cousin's wedding or a girls weekend<br>your motivation is the people before the<br>place but then but almost always the<br>occasions centers around a meal or a<br>food moment and the other reason is an<br>event running a marathon school holidays<br>a concert or dare I say a food festival<br>it's a real change in thinking for New<br>Zealanders to start consuming New<br>Zealand as a pure lizard destination but<br>we aren't competing right now a bit trip<br>to India or Japan or Alaska we're all<br>that's on offer and New Zealanders need<br>to view New Zealand through a different<br>lens what we know through the<br>traditional domestic visitor is that<br>food experiences form a key part of what<br>they do as they are widely accessible<br>and already certain so many define a<br>place they visit the local farmers<br>market wineries restaurants breweries or<br>just soak up a location as Joe mentioned<br>as they enjoy fish and chips on the<br>beach<br>this is food tourism and all communities<br>can benefit I just mentioned that food<br>tourism offers great economic<br>development opportunities for lesser<br>visited destinations and communities and<br>it can help small scale producers this<br>is where the rubber hits the road what<br>we need to do right now is develop this<br>opportunity mobilize our communities<br>around New Zealand that are part of our<br>food story and tell people about what's<br>on offer next slide please<br>connection is my next point our borders<br>won't be connection about the long is<br>about the long game our borders won't be<br>shut forever but while I are let's get<br>busy this image was taken by Wellington<br>business fix and fog peanut butter<br>outside a Central Market supermarket in<br>Texas in April just after they started<br>being stopped via you can also buy Lewis<br>Road Creamery butter there too now<br>before I am going to tell you that the<br>super-mo and that going to the<br>supermarket as a food tourism experience<br>stop right there although going to more<br>Wilson is often considered by many to be<br>one I wanted to talk around the<br>connection between tourism and trade for<br>people who visited New Zealand during<br>the Kansa mr. case another region of New<br>Zealand being able to access our<br>products at your local supermarket is<br>about creating a lasting connection with<br>New Zealand or a region not everybody<br>who visits New Zealand will go home and<br>buy a super yacht now don't get me wrong<br>I'm aware of the importance of some of<br>these high-value industries to New<br>Zealand but we can create a lasting<br>emotional connection with every single<br>visitor to and around New Zealand<br>through food<br>what are this chocolate at Sainsbury's<br>in London or garage project beer at den<br>movies and Sydney's are just examples of<br>this these products tell a story of a<br>sophisticated food producing nation that<br>reflect a modern New Zealand they also<br>create a lasting visitor loyalty to New<br>Zealand and the products produced here<br>connection is also about leveraging our<br>relationships right around the world New<br>Zealand and international shifts and<br>personalities during lockdown many of<br>you would have seen many time number one<br>chef in the world Massimo Bottura<br>officially a stars of virtues of museun<br>and lamb salmon wine and more on an<br>episode of his kitchen quarantine on<br>insta TV he's helping to do our job he's<br>never been here and he's motivated like<br>many to visit because of our superb<br>ingredients we need a stronger<br>connection between New Zealand trade and<br>tourism in this moment and time Max and<br>opportunity as New Zealand has likely to<br>become an even more desirable<br>destination in the long term of the<br>limited international visitor research<br>in the food space it indicates that<br>visitors have very little knowledge or<br>expectation of New Zealand food<br>experiences outside of our traditional<br>messaging around butter Sauvignon Blanc<br>and things like green-lipped mussels<br>Nick's I place they are a number of<br>challenges but I've really only got time<br>to address one the image on the slide<br>says a lot this is an image of New<br>Zealand food that we have for so long<br>taken to the world happysheep<br>on rolling hills young we love lamb and<br>gosh what a pretty destination we are<br>but this also spells out our challenge<br>New Zealand doesn't have a defined food<br>style and we've littmus been a barrier<br>for far too long<br>consider our recent history in colonial<br>past when the first European settlers<br>arrived rather than being influenced by<br>indigenous culture they look towards the<br>motherland for culinary inspiration and<br>so the Sunday roast meat pies and better<br>fish and chips became pillars of what we<br>define is I talk comic Kiwi food and<br>whilst modern British cuisine is now up<br>there with the best in the world it's<br>fair to say that traditional British<br>cuisine that influenced our recent<br>culinary culture isn't known for its<br>creativity or exciting flavors but as a<br>result of well over and a century of<br>emigration in our proximity to the<br>Pacific in Asia we have embraced many<br>cuisines as well as alliance of Maori<br>cuisine these moderate influences mean<br>we don't have a singular calorie culture<br>fronts like other countries we didn't<br>invent pasta curry or sushi multiple<br>ethnic cuisines have created an<br>incredibly vibrant and innovative food<br>culture but they have made it harder to<br>cohesively define what New Zealand<br>cuisine is but New Zealand does have a<br>food story we are the youngest country<br>on earth our relatively very recent<br>history does mean that our food culture<br>is still evolving the challenge is for<br>New Zealanders to understand and embrace<br>our food culture it's not just about<br>pavlova pineapple lumps or jeffers know<br>our food culture runs deeper than there<br>it's about our terroir and not just the<br>land that produces fabulous wine it's<br>about embracing our own Alois way our<br>place in the world and having confidence<br>in ourselves in New Zealand and what we<br>produce above all it's our connection to<br>an understanding of our land<br>kaitiakitanga<br>looking at land not as owners but as<br>Guardians and not as separate from the<br>land but part of it and it's partly<br>because of our connection to the land<br>sea lakes and rivers that our produce is<br>world-class incredible karma wanna our<br>grasp it'd be the best lamb in the world<br>in fact found and wild venison and of<br>course superb dairy hops apples grapes<br>olive oil peanut butter and chocolate<br>and when you've got all these kinds of<br>quality ingredients we've learned not to<br>miss around with them our food style<br>doesn't masquerade as in anything else<br>it respects the core ingredients<br>elevating them to another level our<br>Maori County traditions also play an a<br>major role in what defines our distinct<br>culinary culture methods of cooking<br>right honey<br>and the use of indigenous ingredients<br>like hot Appy talk our car and manuka<br>are all unique to us but why are these<br>herbs not readily available in a<br>supermarket like megi cumin and cinnamon<br>oregano and thyme our respect and<br>understanding of where our ingredients<br>have come from and who's grown them our<br>cultural references of New Zealand<br>Europe and Asia and throw on some clever<br>and very risk-taking shifts into the mix<br>and that's when the different elements<br>of our food story come together<br>New Zealand produces the world's best<br>ingredients they are our food story and<br>they set us apart right now is the<br>moment that we need all New Zealanders<br>to realize this so that answer the<br>question what role will food play in the<br>re-imagination of new zealand tourism<br>post cope at 19<br>one loves New Zealand and our food more<br>than our team of five million they are<br>the most patriotic ambassadors that we<br>had so it's time to harness that love<br>enthusiasm and manake Tonga that<br>newzealanders half our food and our<br>country and use them to help share our<br>story with the world we need to be proud<br>of New Zealand food and beverage<br>celebrate them support them consume them<br>and make them truly ours appreciate<br>truly indigenous New Zealand ingredients<br>until everyone everywhere all the time<br>just how good it really is and just thin<br>we might find that we start appreciating<br>what a fabulous food culture New Zealand<br>really has and just proud we are of it<br>and I said in fact we are the world's<br>hero Thank You Sara<br>and if the promotion of food tourism is<br>in your hands were in very good hands<br>really passionate and thank you and well<br>now we have time for questions and thank<br>you to everyone who's been popping those<br>into the Q&amp;A section ian has been really<br>busy and typing some text answers to<br>those but don't worry if you've moved<br>into the answered section I will draw on<br>some of those as well and you can also<br>upload questions and I don't think we'll<br>get through everything that's being<br>asked at the moment so if there is one<br>there you'd like to see answer try and<br>get it to the top and I'll try and get<br>that included now I'm just gonna stop<br>sharing my screen and so you can see<br>other panelists as well um hopefully<br>they've popped up there and and for our<br>first question I'm actually gonna get<br>one of the answered one it was one of<br>our early questions that we had so I'm<br>just gonna have to scroll through and<br>and find it and from Fiona Newsome who<br>it's quite a long question but I think<br>essentially it touched on some of the<br>some of the things that um Sarah you<br>were you were talking as Fiona was<br>typing this and you were talking about<br>New Zealanders and sort of musical I'll<br>just need to view New Zealand through a<br>different lens so Fiona's and question I<br>think really sort of boils down to that<br>you know New Zealand's are very<br>self-sufficient and independent we often<br>like to self Drive navigate ourselves<br>but perhaps that independent culture<br>might me<br>we're missing out on some of these<br>experiences including food experiences<br>so so how do you think you can manage<br>that sort of scene through a different<br>lens and Sarah I'll throw it to you<br>first<br>sure I mean I think actually job's done<br>for us because we can't get out of here<br>so we are kind of stuck in New Zealand<br>right now and we you know as I say we're<br>literally being held captive so I think<br>actually we're going to sui we'll see a<br>natural shift and I myself I've just<br>returned yesterday from a driving<br>holiday around the East Cape of the<br>North Island and you know of course I<br>had some great culinary experiences<br>while I would beer but they were you<br>know five-star restaurants they were<br>fish and chips on the beach and a power<br>pie and a ham sandwich and a custard<br>square you know those are kind of the<br>more quintessential experiences so I<br>suppose it but in terms of answering the<br>question in terms of you know are we<br>messing out i I think effectively people<br>who have perhaps you know had big<br>holiday plans otherwise curtailed will<br>start looking at what the options are in<br>New Zealand I mean I am I know lots of<br>other people doing it and I'm really<br>excited about exploring what's out there<br>and food will become a very core part of<br>it because guess what we've all got to<br>eat Joe can I bring you in Andrew Clark<br>has asked a question which I think<br>really sort of links on from that but<br>particularly draws on your experience in<br>working in rural regions and looking at<br>the idea and the moment is his question<br>was answered by Ian so it moved off my<br>screen but this is really about how do<br>we develop regional food and tourism<br>attractions and whether or not that<br>viewer Nelson what are the what are the<br>sort of packaging points of difference<br>what can be offered I think there are<br>lots of opportunities for regional food<br>tourism I think a lot of regions are<br>looking to food experiences in their<br>offering and there are food festivals<br>and events everywhere I think one of the<br>things that's really important is to<br>make sure that the food experience you<br>offer unique unique and authentic for<br>the region you are n so you know<br>different regions of New Zealand produce<br>different there are there is<br>- yeah and there are different wines in<br>different regions so you know if your if<br>your have lock then it makes sense to<br>have mussels as a key component of the<br>food you present but if you are Hamilton<br>it may make less sense to showcase<br>mussels and I think leading on from that<br>first question as well and yes we are<br>independent New Zealanders travel on our<br>own we but in some ways that makes us<br>more likely to find out those special<br>places behind you know get behind front<br>stage because we are pottering around in<br>farmers markets we have confidence to<br>perhaps engage with locals because we we<br>do understand how things work and so the<br>lack of the kind of I guess and tourism<br>research we talk about the environmental<br>bubble you know the fact that New<br>Zealanders aren't travelling with a<br>bubble and an entourage of a ton of tour<br>guides and interpreters means that we<br>are closer to perhaps meeting those<br>local people and getting those local<br>experiences opportunities for regional<br>tourism and for telling regional stories<br>I think the stories and the narratives<br>are really really important not just for<br>tourism but also for food provenance so<br>learning about the places where things<br>are made helps you to have a connection<br>with those faces and people and I know<br>the farmers I'm working with in North<br>Canterbury a large part of the reason<br>they want to get involved in tourism and<br>a greeter ISM is because they're really<br>passionate about their land and they're<br>passionate about their farm and their<br>stories and they want to show Rueben New<br>Zealanders you know country a katana you<br>know what they're doing with their<br>resources with their environmental<br>systems and so on so and I think that's<br>answering one of the other questions<br>there so I think there's lots and lots<br>of opportunities for those really<br>one-on-one conversations between the<br>producers and interests thanks Joe can I<br>bring you in there's a couple of<br>questions that are sort of slightly<br>merged but they're there around some of<br>that sort of value chain side of things<br>both in terms of kind of how to connect<br>sort of storytelling with an equitable<br>value chain but also looking at kind of<br>how chosen businesses and food producers<br>might be making<br>sessions around what they focus on to to<br>attract you is it a focus on<br>cost-cutting is it looking at discounts<br>you know what sort of revenue options<br>might there be for in this area as well<br>well I think that's a classical example<br>of management and I think businesses<br>have to make they have to ask the<br>question is what is the value that<br>tourists<br>care for in terms of in terms of them in<br>the terms of price sensitivity because<br>even in my world just doesn't mean about<br>him discounting and about giving about<br>giving there are still a very very very<br>solid model so when it comes to<br>experience when it comes to experiences<br>in volume there is a high-end protect<br>but you better remember with good<br>experiences like hotel accommodations<br>you don't have to price that one<br>experience and have the same price all<br>the time of you every day of my time<br>yeah very many principles from<br>management the alignments telling us and<br>discounts are appropriate but also when<br>you can extend the price so limited<br>availability or capacity it's a<br>confident it's a combination of<br>understanding when demand is in<br>relationship to supply Thanks thanks Ian<br>I will just suggest those I mean a<br>couple of questions early on about and<br>the availability of the presentations we<br>will be taking presentations and there<br>will be uploaded to YouTube later and<br>we'll send out a link when all of that<br>kind of curation has been done so these<br>will be available because I think<br>there's some really great ideas that I'm<br>sure you want to share and share more<br>widely and I'd like to now turn to<br>Sarah's question which has been a<br>popular upvoted and this is looking at<br>postcode do we think will be a change in<br>perception from urban New Zealand around<br>the dairy sector and see it celebrated<br>more both.you food tourism but also its<br>key<br>in New Zealand's economy um I'll open<br>that up you'd like to take that one<br>first I would like to see and just to<br>talk I think there are many issues with<br>dairy industry I think about nineteen<br>position dairy industries we have to<br>look at the dairy industries plant<br>solution and they're all with farming<br>and the dairy industry particularly how<br>we can partner together or to move<br>forward in terms of leverage that's my<br>skin thanks Ian Joe does this feel into<br>some of the work that you've done um<br>yeah I guess so Sarah did you have some<br>thoughts as well all I was gonna say is<br>I mean I suppose feeding into what I was<br>saying before about people looking at<br>domestic tourism I mean on fan<br>experiences certainly popular with it<br>when I was in Lisbon I did an on-farm<br>experience just you know I would never<br>normally do something like that but it<br>was fantastic<br>um but I think you know just even if<br>last year we've seen organizations like<br>Fonterra do open days for people from<br>the city to go the farms and they have<br>been they've proved hugely popular and<br>sold out so I do think there is an<br>appetite excuse the pun for people to<br>experience more on-farm types of<br>experiences whether it be dairy or<br>otherwise so I mean I it's just we<br>perhaps need to take a bit more time to<br>explore what it is that they can offer<br>and you know what people what people<br>want but I do think there is definitely<br>an opportunity yet yeah I can add to<br>that as well but Lincoln University has<br>a dairy open day and I'm always really<br>pleasantly surprised there are hundreds<br>of people thousands come through and<br>learn about dairy farming and I think<br>it's part of what I was saying about<br>this into general relativity but the<br>idea of wanting to share things with the<br>next generation so you know I grew up<br>with a pet lamb and Lincoln there's no<br>way in the world that my daughter's<br>going to have a pet lamb and Lincoln now<br>because there are 8,000 people but but<br>you know again I think there is a sort<br>of nostalgia for the way things were and<br>I think revisiting farms you know<br>replanting vegetable gardens teaching<br>the next generation<br>or our friends who may not have<br>experienced that I think there's a lot<br>of people wanting to get back to some of<br>those things and you're taking kids to<br>farms how many people in New Zealand<br>haven't been to a farm yeah yeah but<br>you're taking kids to farms getting out<br>I was really happy and to see in Lincoln<br>over lockdown that there were a lot of<br>family it's just kind of you're poking<br>at things in the river with a stick that<br>was my entertainment as a child there<br>was no McDonald's or theme parks I'm<br>poking at things and rivers or the stick<br>yeah there'll be lots of opportunities<br>to do that on farms or out in rural<br>areas but also farmers represent rural<br>New Zealand they represent that cape<br>also that hinterland sense of what the<br>arm and if it's with some of the trends<br>we've been talking about farming is<br>about getting back to basics our means<br>about the outdoors well we have times of<br>crisis we tend to go back to simplicity<br>and to pull back to nature and tend to<br>go back that's the milk that's the cow<br>back to the dairy and it's that connect<br>to connectivity between young come from<br>and where we are in farms represent that<br>within that just just watch country<br>calendar there's always that strong<br>connection between call it an easy food<br>to go to to the rest of the world to<br>rest in museum and that's that<br>connectivity and it could be everything<br>extremely Mishra mozzarella cheese to to<br>beetroot to a specialist sheep there's a<br>connection we did a study in so<br>in-district last year asking food<br>producers about you know what was the<br>food identity of of cell one it was<br>really interesting there was quite a big<br>distinction between those people up in<br>the high country or late collar edge<br>sort of area and the people down sort of<br>rolleston christchurch end of the<br>district but up in the mountains you<br>know it was all about this is our<br>heritage this is the New Zealand<br>heritage the story of big sheep and beef<br>farms and in pastoral farming and arable<br>pharming and you know i think it is a<br>really important calendar when I was<br>growing up it was country calendar and a<br>dog show I mean that was that was TV<br>viewing I think there is a sense that<br>you're getting back to the next nature<br>and we know that actually hands in the<br>soil is one of the best things for<br>mental health actually being grounded in<br>that way<br>with the land with the soil is really<br>good for mental health as well Joe I<br>think that's a fantastic point to close<br>on and we have run out of run out of<br>time there are a few questions we<br>haven't yet got to but we always do<br>download the questions and share them<br>with our panelists as well so they can<br>see the other questions being answered I<br>will also give a shout out to I think<br>it's Gareth you sort of suggests a twist<br>on 100 cent pure bean hunt tasty which I<br>thought was quite a nice a nice turn as<br>well but I would like to thank our three<br>presenters today Ian Joe and Sarah I<br>think it's been a fantastic insight into<br>food tourism and some of the<br>opportunities that they present focusing<br>on New Zealand but
