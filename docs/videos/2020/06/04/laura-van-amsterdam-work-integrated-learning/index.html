here today with<br>laura van<br>amsterdam from ultrafast fiber she's got<br>a little bit of advice for our um<br>upcoming graduates and she's going to<br>talk a little bit about herself and her<br>role<br>so laura i'll hand over to you to<br>explain who you are and what you do and<br>then we'll get into our questions<br>perfect thank you um so obviously i'm<br>laura<br>um i am the people and culture manager<br>at ultrafast fibre<br>um so i've actually been here for a year<br>now<br>um which is great so um just a little<br>bit about ultras fibre we actually used<br>to be<br>um i used to be a group function across<br>well which is<br>the electricity distribution um and in<br>november last year we we split and so i<br>stayed with ultrafast fiber so i used to<br>work across both companies and now i<br>just um work here<br>cool and you obviously enjoy it you've<br>been there a while now<br>yes no i love it it's probably i can<br>handle my heart say one of the best<br>companies i've ever worked for<br>and i've worked for a few so um i<br>definitely am very happy with my<br>decision<br>that is so awesome and i'm assuming with<br>the whole pandemic going on you guys<br>have been working from home<br>yes we have although we are an essential<br>business so we did have some people<br>still in the office because we were able<br>to do that still<br>um however the majority of people<br>obviously worked from home because<br>you can't have 150 people sitting in one<br>office obviously<br>um so yeah most of us are working from<br>home<br>cool and what skills did you pick up as<br>a result of having to work remotely<br>well um it actually it wasn't as<br>difficult as i thought<br>i thought i would be the type of person<br>who would never work from home<br>um because i always felt like my role<br>um required people and and being with<br>people and having people come to me<br>but i think having everyone worked from<br>home kind of jump started that actually<br>this is possible<br>if everyone has the you know works the<br>same way and everyone's working from<br>home<br>um so it wasn't as challenging for me as<br>i thought it would be<br>um however there is a bit of a barrier<br>in collaboration<br>sometimes because um it is hard to kind<br>of<br>write on a whiteboard um and talk about<br>things as much as you could if you were<br>in the office yeah do you have areas of<br>a normal workday that we're challenging<br>during the lockdown um<br>i would probably say no there isn't any<br>kind of general um<br>work day stuff although we have a um<br>a professional coffee machine here um<br>and so that was quite hard not to to be<br>able to make my flat white every morning<br>um that was probably the biggest barrier<br>to my day<br>i'm sure a lot of people relate to that<br>yeah<br>um in terms of our graduates um<br>obviously there's a bit of stress at the<br>moment<br>the job market is quite tough have you<br>got anything you'd suggest<br>um on just how they could navigate the<br>crisis<br>and how they can get help yeah so<br>um it's such a hard time for everyone at<br>the moment<br>and there are definitely some industries<br>who are still hiring such as ours<br>um so i think that the key is to<br>to find those industries that are still<br>hiring still<br>working still expanding and<br>i would say be prepared to start from<br>the bottom<br>and um you know don't follow that<br>traditional<br>you know finding graduate role or or a<br>role that<br>you would have really liked to have<br>started on um<br>one of the key things especially in our<br>business is that<br>we do hire internally quite often<br>so for example on on our service desk<br>who are the people who are answering the<br>phones in that first point of contact<br>you know i have people in there that<br>have um<br>you know business degrees and i t<br>degrees<br>and they spend a couple of years in<br>there learning our systems<br>and then they get promoted within the<br>business and then they go into the it<br>team<br>or the assets team and then they get to<br>start using that degree<br>that they work so hard for so<br>i definitely say that i know it is hard<br>to<br>to start from the bottom and do<br>something that you know<br>you know you didn't study but it<br>actually is going to help in the long<br>run so be prepared to<br>find a company that um is willing to<br>grow still<br>and a company that still aligns with<br>your values<br>and your personality and then just work<br>your way up from the bottom<br>yeah that's really great advice and they<br>get that work experience as well which<br>a lot of graduates really crave so yeah<br>that's a really good tip<br>um is there any additional avenues you'd<br>recommend graduates to take to<br>get noticed oh<br>that's a difficult one um i would say<br>that<br>linkedin is probably a really good one<br>that um<br>sometimes people forget that if you've<br>kept your<br>linkedin profile up to date that people<br>actually can seek you<br>on on linkedin so recruiters can search<br>for you<br>um for the keywords that are in your um<br>in your profile that they're looking for<br>so make sure you keep it up to date make<br>sure it says<br>everything you want it to about you look<br>at it like it was a cv<br>because people can actually find you on<br>there um<br>so you can do that above and beyond<br>applying for jobs<br>awesome um and are there any skills and<br>attributes or<br>any characteristics that would make<br>potential candidates stand out and you<br>know like<br>then what what should they say um yeah<br>so obviously some experience is great<br>and it's always horrible that you have<br>to get experience to get experience<br>but it's always good to have something<br>as a base because a recruiter needs to<br>or would prefer to have a work referee<br>right they want to<br>call someone that's worked with you to<br>ask about your work experience<br>so customer service roles are really<br>great<br>um because every role really has some<br>kind of customer service involved<br>whether it's an internal customer and<br>external so<br>my role is pretty much customer service<br>but my customers are within the business<br>so having something with customers<br>is is really key so if you worked at um<br>hell's pizza which is where i started<br>you know that's<br>that's really great because you've got<br>some kind of experience and so that you<br>can show<br>and people can call up your referee and<br>say yeah they were really great with<br>customers and<br>you know they went above and beyond<br>fantastic<br>do you have um some tips about<br>interviewing like what would you say<br>your top<br>three graduate about interviews would be<br>yeah so normally i would say<br>anymore but i probably i probably<br>wouldn't recommend that anymore<br>um however you can still make a joke<br>about that so you can be like you know<br>should i shake hands should we not shake<br>hands um<br>because one of the things that i think<br>is key and some of the<br>best interviews that i've had with<br>people have been<br>having a bit of their personality in the<br>interview so<br>a little bit of a joke a little bit of<br>fun um<br>you know showing what kind of person you<br>are is really important because<br>often i'll be interviewing four or five<br>people<br>and they have the same skills you know<br>they're working in the same roles you<br>know<br>sometimes they're people who've even<br>worked in the same company so<br>you're actually comparing them um by<br>skills is quite hard<br>but what you can compare by is culture<br>and fit in the team<br>so you really want to show that<br>personality and show what kind of person<br>you are so they can say<br>you know i really want to work with that<br>guy or that girl you know<br>they're great they're the kind of person<br>that i would want to to hang out with at<br>work and you know work with<br>every day cool i'm going back to your<br>company i mean obviously you've got a<br>lot of employees and<br>you help manage a lot of them i'm sure<br>through your role<br>um are there any ways that your<br>workplace is changing or is going to<br>operate differently post-pandemic<br>oh operate differently um<br>yes i would say that<br>the remote working is going to be a<br>really big<br>thing for us going forward um well it is<br>definitely going to be a big thing going<br>forward<br>and we just announced a new policy<br>recently and it's really allowing people<br>to have<br>kind of full flexibility so it's<br>you want to work in the office two days<br>you want to work at home three<br>maybe you actually really love the<br>office and you want to do it four or<br>five days but<br>that's kind of up to you so we're we're<br>offering people a subsidy now<br>um 200 to purchase any equipment that<br>they may need to<br>work from home whether it's a screen or<br>a laptop or<br>a chair or something um and that's<br>really fresh to show that<br>we understand and we listened and<br>everyone seems to really enjoy um being<br>able to wear it from home<br>so we're going to keep that going for it<br>yeah it's really awesome actually really<br>appreciative of that<br>um yeah because it's really nice to be<br>able to be flexible<br>yeah and we did a lot of surveys during<br>lockdown um<br>asking people you know obviously how<br>they were going but also<br>we asked them is this the kind of thing<br>that you want to keep you know what is<br>what would your<br>new normal look like if you could have<br>anything that you wanted<br>and people really wanted to keep working<br>from home so<br>i think if you've got so many people<br>saying that then you've kind of got to<br>do something about it<br>yeah that's so awesome um<br>in terms of like internal versus<br>external relationships and networking<br>how have you managed these during covert<br>um it's actually it's been okay and i<br>think it's because we were all in the<br>same boat<br>so everyone was having to do<br>zoom meetings or teams meetings um phone<br>calls everyone was having to do it<br>across<br>the count across the country you know<br>not just our company so<br>i think in the beginning everyone was<br>trying really hard like i don't know<br>about you but i was in a lot of meetings<br>um a lot of teams meetings a lot of zoom<br>calls<br>and it has slowly started to decrease<br>now that people are kind of gotten used<br>to it<br>but everyone was really trying to over<br>communicate to make sure that<br>those relationships um were still being<br>fostered during that time<br>but i think everyone kind of realized<br>that you don't need to<br>to do that so much in that um<br>you only need to communicate how you<br>would have before<br>just not face to face anymore so um<br>it hasn't been too bad actually because<br>everyone was in the same boat so<br>we were all trying to keep up those<br>relationships with whoever it was that<br>we would normally have those with yeah<br>and that would work both ways as well<br>wouldn't it<br>like the people would reach out to you<br>as well yeah yeah<br>exactly awesome um well<br>that's my list of questions is there any<br>last thing that you want to tell<br>everyone or any advice that you've got<br>for our grant<br>well um i think probably my biggest<br>thing would be<br>um you know this is a hard time for<br>everyone<br>but i don't want you to feel like you<br>just wanted i don't don't want you to<br>feel like it's not possible<br>um to get into the workforce now because<br>it is always going to be roles out there<br>you just have to change your mindset so<br>you just have to start thinking<br>differently<br>um you know not necessarily following<br>the traditional path<br>that unfortunately some people like us<br>me<br>would have been able to follow you know<br>going into a graduate wall<br>and being able to work my way like that<br>so<br>it doesn't necessarily mean it's um a<br>bad kind of different<br>it might actually be a good kind of<br>different because um<br>you get a better base of experience when<br>you get to be the person at the bottom<br>and learn how a company's run all the<br>way up so<br>yeah definitely um still have a positive<br>attitude about being able to find<br>something<br>awesome well that's everything from us<br>thank you so much for your time today<br>laura<br>you're welcome yeah i hope we cross<br>paths in the real world sometime yes<br>definitely yeah and it sounds like<br>you'll be working from home a little bit<br>which is awesome as well<br>yes definitely i'm loving it actually um<br>although maybe eating a bit too many<br>snacks<br>it's a little bit hard when your<br>kitchen's right there it's always<br>calling</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
