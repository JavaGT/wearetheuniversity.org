Ian yeoman associate<br>professor of tours and future's here at<br>the Wellington School of Business and<br>government but he continues our Dutch<br>flavour in today's panel because he's<br>also visiting professor at the European<br>tourism futures Institute and works<br>closely with Albert and Stefan his most<br>recent publication is the Future Passed<br>of tourism and forthcoming titles<br>include science fiction disruption and<br>tourism and global scenarios for tourism<br>and he'll be talking today about<br>scenarios from new zealand tourism post<br>Coburg 19 now each speaker is going to<br>talk for about ten minutes and then<br>we'll have time for moderated questions<br>and if you have any questions you'd like<br>to ask please use the Q&amp;A function at<br>the bottom of your zoom screen and I'll<br>be asking those questions to our<br>panelists later on so without any<br>further ado I'm going to invite our<br>first speaker Stefan Hartmann to start<br>the debate on building resilient tourism<br>destinations welcome Stefan all right<br>to give an introduction to the theme of<br>today I talk will be about building<br>resilient or some destinations and the<br>question that puzzles me is how to how<br>to build us resilient destinations my<br>story starts basically with how<br>interconnected our world is if you see<br>on the next slide and of representing<br>for me to for my perspective our world<br>is connected it's an image of all the<br>Facebook connections throughout the<br>globe<br>but for me it represents kind of the<br>networked society where we live in the<br>globalized economy I think the<br>interconnections are very clear with the<br>I'll back off with 19 crisis also in the<br>past if you look at international travel<br>and the development of tourism it's just<br>something about how interconnected our<br>world is and if you then think about<br>what are the implications of obsession<br>to connected worlds it's as I think this<br>to understand a notion that I would call<br>the the global local Nexus where yeah<br>it's forces also basically to look at<br>the interactions between the global and<br>the local because the combination of<br>those and the connections between the<br>global in the local are very important<br>for for development outcomes of<br>individuals households communities but<br>regions such as destinations it's<br>basically the interplay the will<br>determine yeah also how a future could<br>look like we move to the next life<br>because it's something because of these<br>interactions between the global and the<br>local<br>many tourism destinations are in a<br>position where they constantly have to<br>respond and adapt to change<br>look at this close it's quite a lot<br>about being responsive to change and a<br>important concept I think should get<br>more attention is the concept of<br>resilience particularly in in tourism<br>studies and<br>still rather in developed underdeveloped<br>and it's about your having extra<br>capacity to absorb the servants undergo<br>change and yeah basically survive and<br>thrive and I think that's an important<br>capacity the capacity to have so if we<br>look at resilience and explore that<br>concept a bit further it's important to<br>ask the questions of course you know<br>research of what the resilience against<br>felt by whom<br>if you think about the resilience<br>against what of course we know about<br>coffee nineteen something that is a<br>worldwide pandemic but it's more than<br>that and I think it's a kind of an<br>underlying yeah challenge to our<br>destination Jessie welcome it's about<br>taking responding and recovering<br>constantly from shocks and disruptions<br>all sorts of crisis which could be about<br>terrorist attacks natural disasters and<br>of course New Zealand has seen a few but<br>it's also about global economic crisis<br>technologies have become obsolete and<br>it's a lot that originates sometimes<br>from elsewhere it's quite quite often<br>beyond the individual or beyond the<br>control the destination but it's<br>something you need to respond to and<br>recover from and then saw was also<br>important to ask the question yeah<br>resilience of wealth by whom and then<br>it's important to to look at different<br>levels I think it's important to look at<br>the level of an individual could be an<br>entrepreneur could be an independent<br>entrepreneur how does this person<br>respond to whatever happens to them and<br>I would haven't happens to their their<br>context its what firms responding to<br>change branches clusters<br>entire industry is responding to change<br>and I'm in the end also sites it would<br>be about dealings that I become obsolete<br>or impersonations that have to develop<br>so it is yes it's the combination of<br>this of all of these these aspects that<br>need to kind of response<br>constantly to through the<br>to their contextual environments so if<br>you would ask me what is in a resilient<br>destination I would say it's it's about<br>the regions and it's by the regions that<br>are at the same time robust this able to<br>cope with change and at the same time<br>flexible enough to to redevelop and<br>reinvent itself and by taking this<br>perspective yeah I kind of adopt a<br>systems approach a systems thinking<br>approach where I see destinations as<br>systems as open systems and because they<br>are all connected to their environment<br>or environment which is related to those<br>different levels as shown before and I<br>also take the perspective that they are<br>complex<br>it's about multiple actors endless<br>interactions self-organizing behavior<br>it's about destinations that develop and<br>evolve in a nonlinear way meaning that<br>the future could look radically<br>different than the past and that is just<br>these destinations are challenged to<br>become or to develop adaptive capacity<br>that allows them to have this ongoing<br>yeah kind of restlessness and to develop<br>itself over time and so in the end it<br>means that destinations are challenged<br>to become resilient because they are<br>open systems and because they are so<br>complex that's kind of the perspectives<br>that I am I take and then it's also a<br>question so what what does it needs what<br>do you need or does a destination need<br>to to get those properties to develop<br>look at the types of resilience in this<br>feature you will find and if in general<br>three approaches to resilience the first<br>two is more of a traditional approach to<br>resilience basically the ability to<br>bounce back so it's about recovering but<br>I think we are looking at especially if<br>you talk about tourism destinations that<br>a way back is always yeah might be<br>impossible and that were basically<br>looking at resilience - yeah<br>evolutionary or more transformative<br>approach to resilience where we have<br>endless system states and that were<br>always in a process of becoming which<br>means moving from sometimes one state to<br>the other moving from one situation to<br>another and it could evolve a radical<br>change as I said before my research is<br>more about recently of course<br>understanding this perspective was<br>really understanding about what does it<br>take to become a brazilian destination<br>which is something i explore and I try<br>to make lists of characteristics and<br>destinations should have and I'd like to<br>just share a few of them because I think<br>we see destinations are you can take a<br>perspective that destinations are kind<br>of on this this ocean you could say<br>trying to reach or in a mountain range<br>trying to get to the highest peak but<br>and they do so by taking small steps and<br>exploring their environments and looking<br>for opportunities and threats trying to<br>take one step up hill and but the<br>problem is is that the landscape is<br>basically constantly chasing youth due<br>to all sorts of factors and forces of<br>change that are beyond their control so<br>they tried to move uphill in this<br>dynamic landscape perspective to take<br>but to do this to develop this<br>resilience I would say first of all well<br>important to adopt this adaptive systems<br>thinking and<br>that I just introduced I think it's<br>important that destinations have<br>increased variety in terms of product<br>experiences but also beyond the tourism<br>industry because of course if you become<br>all dependent on tourism and if well a<br>sector could collapse or for reasons of<br>coffee at the nineteen well it could<br>become very tricky for destination and<br>variety means that some activities or<br>reinvented over time I think it's also<br>important to enhance connectivity<br>between stakeholders which is I think in<br>the tourism industry often lacking or<br>any developed that we take them for<br>granted that we think we are connected<br>to the other but actually in practice we<br>don't and we don't collaborate or we<br>don't build products of correlations or<br>we meet just once a year because not<br>really sharing stories sharing<br>perspectives and I think that's a major<br>issue in many destinations because<br>entrepreneurs or sometimes not even half<br>the time they don't today they're on a<br>survival survival mode to survive from<br>one day to the other I think it's also<br>important to promote this idea of policy<br>answering governance systems to<br>pronounce different levels that I showed<br>from the individual to maybe the United<br>Nations rule through the organization<br>and everything in between and that it's<br>important that there are there's not one<br>single actor in control because it might<br>give you a sense of control which is in<br>complex systems quite yeah I think a<br>trap to be honest and it's important to<br>support this environmental sensitivity I<br>think this first scenario planning comes<br>in if you know what happens in this<br>environment where destinations are in<br>our development takes place so<br>understanding political developments<br>economic developments in Moscow<br>developments etc and know about the<br>implications of those developments and<br>befall scenarios and think about the<br>implications of the scenarios<br>for particularly destinations they do it<br>over and over because in the end I think<br>that stimulates learning and to be a<br>sense of reflexivity that you are also<br>able to conclude that you might need to<br>change organizations people's products<br>to be able to take a next step and to be<br>able to to evolve maybe towards new<br>future situations this is just a short<br>list and would say I think there's much<br>more to say and I'm also always open for<br>for new items new things<br>I think the shooting fruit in this list<br>because I think that's also where my<br>learning comes in so very short<br>introduction is much more to say please<br>look into also my academic work on this<br>topic because I love this is in the<br>articles that are wrapped Thank You<br>Stephanie it's a really insightful<br>introduction to give us a bit of context<br>and I'm sure I'm not the only one who's<br>looking down you're a list of conditions<br>about building resilience and thinking<br>of how it might apply both to New<br>Zealand but also destinations within is<br>an try our international attendees for<br>their own their own context as well and<br>I'm sure will come come back to come<br>back to that so I'd now like to<br>introduce our second speaker our<br>professor Albert pasta and who's going<br>to talk to us about scenarios for the<br>global visitor economy in 2025 welcome<br>Albert<br>Albert we'll just make sure you're<br>unmuted won't be moments good morning<br>everybody welcome to the webinar yes as<br>a European Tour's and futures Institute<br>we have been there for about 10 years<br>now and over the past 10 years we have<br>been developing scenarios and we forward<br>strategic foresight for small businesses<br>bigger businesses trade organization<br>governments destinations and so on and<br>usually we do these things based on the<br>question that we get from one of these<br>clients however with the emergence of<br>the cope with crisis we said well we<br>need to respond to this as an institute<br>with expertise in this field we need to<br>support the industry globally with that<br>with with drafting efuses perspective<br>because what we see nowadays especially<br>in the media is that many governments<br>and so on come with short term solutions<br>so short-term solutions are of course<br>interesting because they might help to<br>recover the industry as it was however<br>it could be that the global crisis<br>change the demand changes the demand for<br>tourism every requires different kinds<br>of businesses different kinds of<br>concepts new business models and that's<br>what we try to do so instead of offering<br>predictive scenarios such as forecasts<br>that many actors do at the moment<br>instead of offering gold buy scenarios<br>which is basically a kind of strategy<br>you could take to to to tackle the<br>future we decided to develop exporting<br>scenarios and explorative scenarios are<br>literally multiple pitches of how the<br>future of global tourism could evolve<br>next slide please<br>so how does that work well normally we<br>bring together a large group of actors<br>at the table in workshop like settings<br>and we discuss each other's we with each<br>other's with each other the perceptions<br>they have we share expertise we<br>challenge each other's paradigms and so<br>on and then we go through this process<br>however with this crisis where we have<br>the world online this was a little bit<br>more difficult so what did we do we<br>collected a number of experts from three<br>universities of professional education<br>in the Netherlands associate to self as<br>you see on this slide to centre<br>expertise and leisure tourism and<br>hospitality and we scanned the media<br>experts in the media for about four<br>weeks since the beginning of the crisis<br>we made notes of everything word of what<br>the experts said that could could happen<br>how we used to come and we collected it<br>we made a list and together we analyzed<br>it and we clustered all these variables<br>all these forces into into clusters into<br>groupings and then we asked us out the<br>question what is the driving force<br>behind these different clusters<br>and that led to a short list that you<br>see on the slide the attitude or the<br>role of nation-states the attitude the<br>role of this semi blue black on a public<br>sector we had a to the role of large<br>businesses such as multinationals and<br>the role of the citizens less consumer<br>and the length and the depth of crisis<br>well yeah thank you<br>then we look at this short list and we<br>said well there are basically two of<br>these forces that stand out because<br>they're sorry there are two of these<br>driving forces of change that stand out<br>one is the attitude and role of the<br>citizen and the other is the length and<br>the depth of the crisis why do they<br>stand out well one reason is because we<br>think they are most influential for the<br>future of tourism and the other reason<br>is that we think those two are the most<br>unpredictable concerning the future<br>makes light cleats if we take these two<br>a key uncertainties and we regard them<br>as two axes of a cross next please the<br>first the next please the first axis was<br>the length length and depth of the<br>crisis then we knew that the possible<br>extremes to which this unpredictable<br>force could develop and then we said<br>well one extreme could be alone in<br>shallow crisis and the other one along<br>and deep crisis and the other axis<br>please press please is the citizen and<br>consumer access and that could be a<br>society focused on the I perspectives or<br>hedonistic individualistic versus a more<br>collectivist society if we combine these<br>two axes with the extremes we see in<br>fact the framework of four scenarios<br>emerging please press car<br>the first scenario we call business as<br>usual that is a scenario that is focused<br>on an individualistic society and the<br>create crisis might be over let's say by<br>the end of this year then we expect a<br>fast recovery of tourism return to mass<br>tourism a flourishing visitor economy<br>and strain behavior and our tourism<br>comes back again on the agenda with a<br>high social and ecological pressure if<br>we combine the other exchange the I in<br>perspective with a long and a deep<br>recession we think about the tourism<br>industry that means that international<br>travel has become a luxury product that<br>is only affordable by a few many<br>bankruptcies takeovers nationalization<br>by governments of national railways for<br>example fierce competition on price and<br>the nature Iranian oil environment are<br>exploited to serve tourism a third<br>scenario plus press please is the<br>scenario then we have called business as<br>unusual that's a business in transition<br>in fact we have to deal with a loan<br>crisis and with long we talk about maybe<br>five years so we see Corona are coming<br>back in waves during a couple of years<br>and that means that tourism has to<br>reinvent itself and it has to become<br>accessible to everyone in the in the<br>collectivist society so this requires a<br>lot of creativity innovation from the<br>industry we expect a lot of high-tech<br>robot ization and also you've got<br>concerts and business models we think<br>also that because of this collectivism<br>there's a lot of collaboration between<br>actors in the in the global sea and the<br>key values are purpose Purpose Driven<br>and respect for men and nature a fourth<br>scenario is not a transition but a real<br>transformation of global tourism and<br>then we see a combination of a<br>collectivist society together with<br>chello economy Seoul economy has<br>recovered by the end of the year and<br>then we think that many people have<br>tasted from a society that's different<br>than probably have gone to like it and<br>that means that we see the Emergencies<br>of sustainable tourism many people<br>staying nearby<br>major investments will be in quality and<br>not in quantity and people are also we<br>should prepare to spend a lot of money<br>or relatively a lot of money because I<br>think they do good with paying this<br>amount of money next slide please<br>so these scenarios are just the first<br>attempt by South and European Tour's<br>infusers Institute to to picture<br>multiple futures of tourism and this is<br>not the end of a process we think is<br>just the beginning because we challenge<br>we invite the industry globally to<br>discuss with us the forces that we<br>identified the key uncertainties that we<br>identified the extremes that we came up<br>with but also to review the scenarios so<br>that they become better and that I got<br>think us supported by these three<br>themselves so it's not owned by us<br>anymore but sharing with the industry<br>and then we could use the scenarios as a<br>starting point to translate it to the<br>actual situation of our concrete<br>business in the country and that means<br>that with help of the scenarios they<br>could develop new strategies new<br>business concepts new business models<br>etc<br>and continued of course to the<br>resilience of their business of their<br>destination of their organization as<br>stifle already as introduced to share<br>with you<br>Thank You Albert and introducing us<br>there to the concept of scenarios at a<br>global scale and this will feed into our<br>third and final speaker<br>Ian yeoman and but just whilst we get<br>Ian unmuted and I'll just remind you<br>that we have got the Q&amp;A open and we've<br>already got a couple of questions in<br>there you can both put your own question<br>in there and you can also upload<br>questions as well and we'll be turning<br>to the questions after our third speaker<br>so I'd like to introduce Associate<br>Professor Ian yeoman who is going to<br>talk to us around scenarios for new<br>zealand tourism posts Kovach 19 welcome<br>here so so what you've got in attempts<br>of the work that the European tourism<br>futures Institute has done and solved it<br>is this is a sound basis for taking new<br>zealand tourism forward as Stefan has<br>mentioned the importance is about<br>resilience and what we mean by realist<br>resilience how much death has New<br>Zealand got in the terms of being able<br>to react to be able to in it in order to<br>react to corvÃ©e at 19 and what Albert<br>talks about in the framework that Sultan<br>II the Institute have developed is a<br>Fraser is a framework in order to debate<br>what tourism is like and using the<br>framework in the terms of explorative<br>scenarios you have the opportunity to<br>explore discuss and reimagine what New<br>Zealand tourism could look like so they<br>become adaptive tools in which to build<br>on and engage with the debate in order<br>to develop strategies ideas and<br>philosophies about what you see New<br>you<br>Ian I think you've managed to press your<br>your mute button so we'll just get you<br>and muted there okay so am basically<br>using the framework that it suits<br>developed insult basically what is the<br>the level what is the length and then<br>the depth of the recession and what is<br>the moral dilemma or of citizens next<br>and and and so basically what our Albert<br>talked about in the terms of this<br>framework something sharp and shallow<br>something long and deep and it's the<br>focus in the terms of tourists or the<br>way we behave yet is it about collective<br>responsibility and a care for others or<br>as a strong focus on individualism next<br>slide please<br>so here we have four scenarios within it<br>within a New Zealand context and<br>building upon the framework that's been<br>developed by ft is basically or what<br>I've done is I tend to I tend to<br>visualize scenarios in the terms of<br>trying to get people to a man reimagine<br>what New Zealand tourism could look like<br>and one of the ways to do that is to use<br>film or literature so we have four<br>scenarios here one is crazy rich Asians<br>which is based upon that film if you see<br>if you've seen it the other one is the<br>colony which is a 1995 film which is all<br>about gated communities and this is<br>about New Zealand as an island as a<br>colony as the rest of the world has Cove<br>8:19 this side of paradise is actually<br>taking from an episode of Star Trek<br>which is about he utopian place but one<br>of the issues with utopia is its the<br>trade-offs you met you make and how you<br>get there and the final one contingent<br>is about survival of the fittest so<br>basically the end of tourism as we know<br>so each each of those four scenarios is<br>based upon a range of stories next slide<br>please<br>next slide please so basically crazy<br>rich Asians talks about the elimination<br>basically the elimination of covet 19<br>across the world it's off<br>just it sort of just went away as US<br>president Donald Trump tweeted and and<br>basically it's about going back to<br>normal<br>what new zealand tourism was like pre<br>covet nineteen in the terms of<br>high-growth mmm of a mixture of<br>sustainable tourism and amanda mixture<br>of hellenistic tourism and basically the<br>concepts of over tourism and that word<br>that seems to be a relic now of the past<br>it comes back in force next slide please<br>whereas this is the scenario that nobody<br>wants this is a scenario where corporate<br>19 spreads throughout the world it's<br>it's with us for two or three years it's<br>it sort of goes on and goes on this is a<br>world like that there's no vaccine for<br>it like we have with the common core we<br>we have social disorder across the world<br>although there are pockets of tourism in<br>new zealand in in isolated communities<br>but basically it's this is about a<br>disparity of society a polarizing<br>polarization of society where we've got<br>well we've got economic apartheid next<br>slide please<br>slice of paradise is the complete<br>transformation of tourism the rethinking<br>of tourism of what it means for us it's<br>very altruistic it's a collective<br>approach to well-being right at the<br>heart of it is environmental<br>sustainability and with environmental<br>sustainability we've got strong<br>communities and strong community and<br>strong businesses but basically the<br>state as the is the initiator of of of<br>of the construction of something that's<br>100 pure new zealand it's a very green<br>destination and it's very much a<br>rethinking of what the country is all<br>about or as the final scenario the<br>colony is about um Cove in nineteen is<br>out there it sort of doesn't goes away<br>we sort of get used to it<br>we live with it waves appear and they<br>disappear and it sort of becomes the new<br>normal and new zealand is a colony New<br>Zealand is a<br>one big bubble and fundamentally tourism<br>is a strong focus on our domestic<br>markets so trying to make the four<br>scenarios come alive what do they mean<br>what are some of the core messages<br>they're all about next slide please<br>well that's about some of the signals<br>that we see of these scenarios actually<br>happening today<br>next slide please so we're already seen<br>in China and covet 19 completely<br>disappeared and where the FE star Center<br>started in in Wuhan that's now<br>completely clean and we've seen domestic<br>tourism for example come back in the<br>terms of that this scenario depends upon<br>a vaccine and the terms of this hope for<br>a vaccine because the world collectively<br>there's a very strong focus on trying to<br>find that vaccine next slide please<br>the collapse the collapse of world<br>tourism is what many destinations of<br>what many destinations and what is<br>happening to many countries virtually<br>across the world international tourism<br>has virtually disappeared and as a<br>concert there's a dialogue we've seen<br>destinations that are dependent upon<br>tourism and destinations or countries<br>that have no fallback and we've seen<br>great divisions in societies and you've<br>just got to look what's happening in the<br>United States and here we have the rise<br>of protectionism and a me first attitude<br>next slide please<br>whereas the side of paradise actually<br>what's what's happening with this<br>scenario will we seen it we see we are<br>seeing us we're seeing people in the<br>world focus on collectivism people<br>around us and be kind share look out for<br>your neighbor shop local so there's been<br>a strong focus while we have covet<br>nineteen to rethink what tourism is and<br>what it could be and what it should be<br>and a very strong focus on communities<br>and sustainability and final slide<br>please and again there's examples of<br>this our destinations working in this<br>transition our destinations working in<br>colonies and there's been<br>an initiative from Iceland New Zealand's<br>talking about talks about a bubble etc<br>etc so again next slide please<br>so what are the risks of of these four<br>scenarios going forward next slide<br>please<br>well the risk with crazy rich Asians<br>it's it's that pressure between<br>economics and health it's the rush to<br>reopen and the rush to reopen creates<br>that second wave next slide please<br>we're a survival of the fittest is<br>basically the end of tourism our<br>polarized society<br>a completely different world and a world<br>who do not want next slide please<br>whereas a utopia is is an opposite is<br>the opportunity and the side of paradise<br>and rethinking tourism for New Zealand<br>is are we really taking an opportunity<br>to think about what the future could be<br>and where we want it to be and one of<br>the dangers of of paradise it's<br>somewhere we never get there the like<br>any destination strategies and any<br>destination goals will only start the<br>journey but we never get to the end the<br>colony please the next slide and the<br>problem with gated communities is the<br>big debate that we've got on today it's<br>about leakage when will the second wave<br>come back it's that compromise between<br>economic growth and sustainability it's<br>it's the rush to get it's the rush to<br>get back to work and open up against the<br>health risk next slide please<br>so if we talked about the four scenarios<br>what could the visions be for those and<br>please the first one would would be it's<br>all about<br>let's live more and fear less let's just<br>get out let's just get out there and do<br>it let's take this hellenistic approach<br>and just get back to tourism very<br>quickly and leave our fear behind next<br>slide please<br>well sir well survival of the fittest in<br>the terms of collapse<br>it's about survivor who's the strongest<br>the elimination of the weak taking care<br>of me next slide please<br>well this side of power<br>is thinking about New Zealand has some<br>sort of paradise some sort of eco<br>destination a complete bubble that's<br>greening clean it's all about<br>communities and it's all about feeding<br>for one another next slide please<br>and some sort of vision for the colony<br>it's very much positioning in New<br>Zealand in the terms of we're a cocoon<br>with this place of isolation with this<br>place we're safe to come to and in the<br>terms of what it's all about<br>slice please so what are the strategies<br>for these four scenarios next slide<br>please<br>so basically strategies Chris<br>irritations this is what industry wants<br>next slide please<br>survival of the fittest this is a<br>strategy where we leave tourism behind<br>we save during this period there's no<br>point in doing tourism because it's<br>complete failure rethinking tourism this<br>is what others want this is what others<br>and so do you want and the final one the<br>colony this is what's good this is what<br>you think is going to happen this is<br>where we are now this is this is the<br>world next slide please<br>so some of the the challenges of this<br>slides relate to Chris irritations is<br>about strong economic growth trying to<br>get into industry back very as quickly<br>as possible whereas the side of paradise<br>is about could the complete redesign of<br>tourism it's not what it was Precor of<br>Cove at 19 and the issue between these<br>two scenario is the conflict<br>it's the conflict between jobs and<br>sustainability and some parts of the<br>industry actually don't want to rethink<br>tourism we just want to get back to<br>normal because because it's about<br>business sustainability in the terms of<br>jobs are the slides please the keywords<br>for the colony are about resilience as<br>stefan talked about containment a strong<br>focus on domestic tourism regional<br>bubbles and safety they're the key<br>attributes of us of that strategy and<br>the final one is about it's an exit<br>strategy there is some tourism but it's<br>exclusive<br>so basically some of the questions are<br>where have we been aware with God most<br>of the world is in this contingent<br>scenario it's arrived it's arrived and<br>it's plane havoc and what they're trying<br>to do is get to the colony but they're<br>trying to do that that's what New<br>Zealand has achieved we've arrived at<br>that colony that colony part the key<br>question is well where we are and next<br>where do we want to go do we want to go<br>to this side of paradise and reimagine<br>tourism or do we one two or or zoophilia<br>will let too many tourists in and we<br>actually we actually collapse so that's<br>it those scenarios are just thoughts law<br>scenarios are just ideas and as Albert<br>said the scenarios and the scenarios are<br>actually playing out now there's<br>different aspects of each scenario<br>happening all of the time and the point<br>of doing the scenarios whether it's a<br>global level or for the Netherlands of<br>for New Zealand is there an ongoing<br>story they it's to use them as a framing<br>device create something thank you Thank<br>You Ian<br>well over a three panelists we've<br>explored what a resilient destination is<br>and we've looked at the idea of how we<br>can use scenarios to explore both at a<br>global and a New Zealand level around<br>what the future of tourism might look<br>like and I think also started to think<br>about what we might want want it to look<br>like as well so we're gonna have now<br>open for EM questions and thank you to<br>those of you who have been asking those<br>please pop those into the QA rather than<br>into the chat and I'm going over there<br>now I can't see that Stefan's been hard<br>at work and seeing a few of the initial<br>questions and in the text as well but I<br>think we actually start with one of<br>those one of those questions and open it<br>up to the other panelists as well so so<br>if it I'll come to you first though and<br>looking at David Simmons question around<br>rethinking tourism and a suggestion that<br>this does not appear to fit a short-term<br>crisis and that<br>we really need to look at long-term<br>behavioural changes will be needed for a<br>transformation to a resilient<br>regenerative tourism Stephan Jonah<br>explore a little bit what you started<br>sort of responding to in type there<br>around that sort of tension between the<br>short and the long term yeah I think<br>it's a good and correct statement to be<br>honest I think it's very difficult of<br>course to have long term behavioral<br>changes I think what we see currently<br>especially if you take that because with<br>nineteen crisis the bounce-back<br>situation that we really try to recover<br>and go back to its old situation is<br>comfortable in a situation where we came<br>from we kind of want to go back to the<br>same type of stressful behavior also<br>from the consumer perspective we want to<br>keep the same strategy in place you want<br>to say for and help out all the airlines<br>that we have at the same time there are<br>people of course and one of the<br>scenarios is also trying to look beyond<br>that and trying to look at what are what<br>are alternatives they also mean big<br>transformations and it could be that<br>then if you would say tourism recovers<br>within this new situation it could mean<br>less tourists less income have<br>completely different implications and I<br>think that will take a lot of either<br>courage or powerful leaders who will<br>find good business models and will take<br>the the challenge to develop destination<br>such ways which it really comes down to<br>I think leadership and a good fishing<br>and looking at tourism from a not a<br>economic perspective but from a maybe<br>societal perspective that we see version<br>knowledge a I think goal itself but as a<br>means for certain societal development<br>then I think it also will answer one of<br>the other questions of us talking about<br>tourism or regions I think then we are<br>talking about regions and the impact of<br>tourism or wider societies I think<br>that's where we are<br>going towards I think maybe the crisis<br>like this good help us take one step or<br>a few steps towards the direction that<br>we have good experiments about Spanish<br>that we could find out new business<br>models at work our local communities<br>benefit which would fit the idea of<br>regenerative tourism but I think it's a<br>long way and I think we are starting we<br>might well maybe then a crisis like this<br>will help in this way at the same time<br>it's also a matter of time before I<br>think we are changing tourism because we<br>become very critical<br>beatdowns accepts through some just as a<br>given economic activity I mean this is<br>what the biggest biggest discussion at<br>the moment in the Netherlands where<br>tuition is kind of the dirty word so to<br>say because we want to talk about<br>development the societal development and<br>intuition is one of the many ways to do<br>that<br>thank you Stefan I'm often open that<br>question to the other speakers we've got<br>one which i think is gonna be right in<br>there and airy it's directed at Ian but<br>I'll then invite Albert to share his<br>thoughts as well and and this is the<br>reality of scenario suggests that the<br>lines are blurred and that these<br>scenarios could be playing out<br>simultaneously so in and then Albert<br>your thoughts on that place you're right<br>but these scenarios are explorative<br>they're there to make you think there's<br>never going to be the internet answer<br>there's never going to be the pure<br>scenario so one of the techniques that<br>you can use while you are working with<br>scenarios there's two things one you can<br>constantly update and change the<br>scenarios to represent the environment<br>but but other things you you can do are<br>they ask questions like considering all<br>four scenarios what are the strategic<br>responses you will take because these<br>four worlds are acting out Scimitar<br>simulate send me a ten year sleep thanks<br>Ian<br>Albert's<br>Oh Albert will just get you and message<br>what hold on great is that you can<br>choose a scenario that you like the most<br>and then develop strategies to to pursue<br>that one but in fact it's it's what we<br>try to do with scenarios is trying to<br>understand how the future could evolve<br>without saying that it will evolve like<br>that so it's not a predicted scenario<br>it's just an investigation and<br>exploration along the extremes to which<br>usually what we suggest but usually to<br>do is to look at all four scenarios<br>together and then to see how all those<br>futures because wealthy businesses for<br>example sometimes take one scenario or<br>four times one scenario to be prepared<br>for which is leading to a kind of<br>betting strategy so if system of early<br>warning indicators with with which they<br>can follow emerges of the different<br>scenarios and they could quickly upscale<br>or downscale a certain strategy but for<br>if money is involved you have to be<br>prepared for all futures and at least<br>two robust scenario scenario that<br>resists all possible futures and I<br>sometimes say well you could see the<br>seats now you cross like a cube so it<br>frames the extremes the balls of the<br>cube but what happens within could take<br>any position and that's the challenge<br>you have to take in trying to imagine<br>such a future world<br>Thank You Albert and I'm gonna jump down<br>to you and going Royals question now and<br>before we come back to one that's been<br>up voted on from Caroline or Chesson<br>which is about one of the scenarios but<br>we'll go to guys first and guys ask you<br>about around who makes the decision<br>around that why access around the idea<br>of individual choice versus a more<br>collective approach and and sort of had<br>some if you can if you can see the full<br>question there it's also talking about<br>things like you know isn't it driven by<br>the the dollar who you know the client<br>the truism spend isn't the tourism<br>sector responding to customer<br>preferences so and would you like to<br>explore around kind of a a little bit<br>more about that sort of how those<br>scenarios how that scenario is there's<br>no it are created around the choice of<br>axes and why that's important so you<br>have different stakeholders at the table<br>and each one brings in different<br>background information different<br>expertise if experience also and<br>together you you try to unravel the<br>complexity of our society and together<br>you also closer the things you've<br>observed in society so it's I don't want<br>to make it too scientific but it is<br>based on social constructivism so what<br>we do is as a construct it's a<br>construction of the mind of the minds of<br>the people in the setting so it's not so<br>much a decision from a scientist or by a<br>scientist but it's a collective<br>collective decision what should be the<br>two axes that we frame or scenarios on<br>and so we usually we rank the driving<br>forces of change according to level of<br>impact perceived level orient back then<br>the perceived level of unpredictability<br>so these from the the frame of the axes<br>and all the other forces that we<br>identified get a place in the narratives<br>of the scenarios so some both the axes<br>themselves and the extremes are our<br>other result of that collective debate<br>and discussion so the scenarios thing<br>and Caroline Hodgson asks around the<br>survival of the fittest scenario which<br>results and which suggests was resulting<br>mix exploitation of nature and the<br>environment but also points out if the<br>tourism system<br>would that not lead to less<br>environmental exploitation because<br>particularly with international air<br>travel significantly declining hence<br>carbon emissions will reduce so perhaps<br>we could dig a little bit more into that<br>scenario you'd like to get a couple of<br>thanks again I think within any scenario<br>this there's a cost benefit there's a<br>cost benefit analysis I don't think<br>anybody um once a world where we've got<br>it's the trade-off between climate<br>change and jobs so um but it's not a<br>sustainable it's not a sustainable<br>scenario if you look at if you look if<br>you look at that survival of the fittest<br>scenario basically if you look at if you<br>take a sustainable development goals<br>perspective maybe for climate change<br>you're achieving that goal but you're<br>not achieving the other 16 goals from<br>that type of perspectives you've got<br>poverty you've got war<br>you've got collapse you actually don't<br>have death destinations can't respond to<br>crisis because there's no wealth there's<br>no money in that society so it's a very<br>it's a very distant it's a very<br>dystopian scenario in the terms of going<br>for going forward in life there's lots<br>of destitute there's lots of riots so um<br>it's not a world that I would like to<br>live in Albert your thoughts on that<br>sort of tension in that survival of the<br>fittest surround the exploitation nature<br>compared to some of the gains we might<br>we might have in terms of reduced carbon<br>emissions competition in order to to<br>make your business or the industry<br>survive so and that includes the<br>exploitation of the environment of<br>social social structures etc so of<br>course maybe there will be less flies<br>but<br>still replies but it's also what happens<br>in the destinations themself so<br>everything is done at the cost of the<br>environment and of sustainability if you<br>want to make a tourism benefit from it<br>now we have time for just one more<br>question and we still have a number that<br>I don't have that won't be answered so<br>apologies if we don't get to your<br>particular one but as Stefan's doing a<br>great job there and putting some<br>comments as we go through as well I<br>think I'm actually gonna end up with<br>with sort of a broad question I'm going<br>to Stefan at first and this is Tim's<br>comment that Troezen will continue<br>people will always want to travel and<br>explore domestically and internationally<br>I like your posing a question back to<br>audience member but can you explore that<br>a little bit more around that kind of<br>yep will it always continue prediction<br>situation I think if you leave it up to<br>society to the tourists themselves I<br>think there's a big hunger to travel<br>which is something we've build up for<br>over many decades that's very strong<br>very strong feeling that people have a<br>right to travel maybe even but I think<br>we will get back to the old over tuition<br>discussion again sooner or later and I<br>think a few months ago all of us were<br>talking about our tuition and about how<br>to manage growth how to do crowd<br>management citizen management what type<br>of tourists do we want do we allow<br>tourism and the tourism industry to do<br>kind of whatever they want I think there<br>were a lot of initiatives like<br>responsible tourism regenerative tourism<br>destination stewardship programs kind of<br>emerging I think they were still I would<br>call them the kind of the grassroots<br>initiative still but I think there was<br>and kind of your your early warning if<br>you like about potential new future that<br>we don't allow for tuition to grow and<br>we send society leaders<br>politicians because I think the impact<br>on local communities could be that big<br>that we just are beyond it's not<br>annoying or irritating it's kind of we<br>don't tolerate thirst anymore and then<br>we need to find a good good balance so<br>the question I think yes the amount will<br>grow people will like to travel more the<br>question is do we allow supply to<br>develop in that way to match the month I<br>wonder really wonder it's not to me it's<br>up to decision makers<br>but I really truly wonder if we allowed<br>it thank you now we are coming to time<br>so I'm gonna leave it on that slightly<br>uplifting point there around and kind of<br>what is it that we want to happen and<br>how do we influence things I'd like to<br>thank all of those who've attended and<br>I'd like to thank Earth's three speakers<br>Albert Stefan and Ian for a really<br>stimulating discussion around how we can<br>think about the future using scenarios<br>and it certainly has prompted lots of<br>questions and thoughts I'd like to also<br>just remind us that remind the audience<br>that this is one of a series of webinars<br>that we're running the next one is on<br>Wednesday the 10th of June that's next<br>week and 2 to 3 p.m. so I don't think<br>Stefan and Albert will be phoning in<br>from and from the middle of the night in<br>the Netherlands then but it's on the<br>roll of food tourism in the reimagine<br>ation of new zealand tourism post covert<br>19 in yeoman will be returning to talk<br>about food tourism trends we have Joanna<br>fountain and from Lincoln University is<br>an expert on food and Agri tourism and<br>we've got Sarah Meeker the festival<br>director of New Zealand's largest<br>Culinary Festival Wellington on a plate<br>exploring that question we've got<br>upcoming seminars in the next couple of<br>months on smart destinations destination<br>recovery strategies value-based pricing<br>revenue management and responsible<br>tourism you can find out more and<br>register for all of those on the link<br>you can see that at the bottom there and<br>once again thank you to our speakers<br>thank you for the crew behind the scenes<br>and those who've been asking questions<br>and following on the recording of this<br>will be released in due course if<br>there's anything you'd like<br>go back and have a look over but<br>otherwise thank you very much for</p></main><footer
