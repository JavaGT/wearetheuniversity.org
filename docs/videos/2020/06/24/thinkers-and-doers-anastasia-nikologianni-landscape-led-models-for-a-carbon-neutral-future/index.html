joining us here in<br>New Zealand and from across the globe<br>it takes a pleasure to welcome you to<br>the lecture of Anniston see and Nicola<br>Gianni as part of the thinkers and doers<br>lecture series we are live-streaming on<br>Facebook at the International Federation<br>of landscape architect's page<br>my name is Bruno Marquez and I am the<br>program director for the landscape<br>architecture program and the e'terica<br>waka Victoria University of Wellington<br>the thinkers and doers lecture series I<br>am said bringing together practitioners<br>scholars students and our wider<br>community of landscape architects but<br>also the affiliated built environment<br>disciplines to share ideas and to hear<br>the latest innovations in the field<br>this is initiative between the New<br>Zealand Institute of landscape<br>architects our Wellington branch and the<br>landscape architecture program at<br>Victoria University of Wellington our<br>third speaker and Nastasia Nicola Gianni<br>is a research fellow and consultant at<br>Birmingham City University in the UK and<br>she's part of the ket ID BECU team and<br>international multidisciplinary research<br>design and consultancy hub the words the<br>water produced thanks to place quality<br>of life in sustainability or into<br>transformation at the top of the<br>political agenda<br>anastasiya holds a PhD in landscape<br>architecture in climate emergency in her<br>work is primarily focused on climate<br>change issues the extent to which<br>special quality and low carbon can be<br>delivered in original landscape design<br>as well as the visual representations<br>that contribute to the design process in<br>your spare time and because she has<br>plenty of it she is also the chair of<br>emerging professionals group at the<br>International Federation of landscape<br>architects but also she takes part in<br>various other professional communities<br>such as policy and communications as<br>well as climate emergency and<br>biodiversity response at the landscape<br>institutes in the United Kingdom the<br>talked achieved about the presenters is<br>titled climate crisis<br>let's keep land models for a carbon<br>neutral future this lecture touches upon<br>the climate challenges we face an impact<br>is half to the value of our landscape<br>our communities and economies using<br>real-life projects she will discuss on<br>innovative models that have demonstrated<br>the significance of policy<br>transformation and the landscape in<br>strategic design within<br>multidisciplinary teams and coalition<br>processes just some very quick<br>housekeeping rules do not forget that<br>anastasiya will be sharing your screen<br>so keep this window open so you can see<br>her slides I also please remind muted<br>throughout to talk to avoid any<br>background noise at the end of this talk<br>you will have the opportunity for<br>questions either verbally or in written<br>through the chat box and in zoom please<br>join me in giving anastasiya a warm<br>welcome all the way from Birmingham<br>England into our public webinar as you<br>see it the stage is yours<br>welcome good morning for you actually<br>good evening for us<br>thank you very much Bruna for inviting<br>me and the Victoria University of<br>Wellington so really look forward to<br>share with you some thoughts today so<br>oh it works fine let me know if he<br>doesn't so oh okay this is the moment<br>when we think technology can now yeah<br>now<br>you<br>so usually takes thing it takes a few<br>seconds so I'll try to think about that<br>while presenting so hello everyone thank<br>you very much for joining us and again<br>thank you Bruno Marquez and Victoria<br>University of Wellington for inviting me<br>in this lecture talking about climate<br>crisis and landscape LED models I would<br>like to start with posing a question<br>even though it might be early in the<br>morning for you I would like it to think<br>where you where you've come from I would<br>like you to bring in mind the landscape<br>you've grown up the memories you have<br>from this land could be young age or<br>maybe later on and how this has saved<br>the way you're thinking or interacting<br>with with the land how your roots your<br>memories with that and how this has<br>probably define you as a person or as a<br>community in general sharing my own<br>experience from a Ania Greece I live in<br>the UK but I am from Greece Kenya where<br>have been quite lucky and my hometown to<br>have close links with the environment<br>from a very young age and therefore this<br>has helped me to realize how important<br>significant the environment and the<br>landscape is and also seeing simple<br>things we think like how we produce our<br>foods where we're part the long we're<br>part of a community what are the<br>benefits of nature of landscape in our<br>daily lives so without thought in your<br>mind I would like you to keep it in your<br>mind and take it with you in what we're<br>going to discuss tonight so keeping<br>these images you have from your past or<br>maybe even present if this is so<br>significant for you let's think how<br>we've moved from something like that<br>from the environment to something like<br>this climate emergency where are we<br>heading really we've all seen pictures<br>like these global challenges people<br>struggling for their lives struggling<br>from their future next generation<br>businesses soaking images really that<br>somehow make us realize how important<br>thoughts of these issues are and they<br>they tend to to help us somehow probably<br>because they're quite scary do you think<br>you know what's next next sometimes we<br>think there's nothing we could do or<br>nothing we could control but I would<br>argue that all of us either as landscape<br>architects designers planners or even<br>individuals could do something and I<br>reckon that's why we're here tonight or<br>today for you so what is the impact of<br>this climate emergency what is the<br>impact in our landscape in our daily<br>lives the communities we live in all the<br>businesses we relate what is the impact<br>in our social activities and in our<br>economy<br>we have to take under consideration that<br>these are not phenomenon that happened<br>suddenly or you know a one-off<br>experience<br>but these are becoming common a common<br>routine for all of us and no matter<br>where we are in the world<br>so make one's wonder is it really just<br>about the landscape or is it really just<br>a climate crisis or some people ask to<br>still ask me today the climate change<br>some people still ask me today or is it<br>actually a crisis well I would argue is<br>a climate crisis and it is an emergency<br>we have to do something for it and we<br>have to think we need to start really<br>start thinking some of the areas that we<br>know are in our surroundings where we<br>leave us but they might change in their<br>future some areas are for example I have<br>one here in fully-armed any limos they<br>are part of the mainland but with half<br>meter rise<br>water level arise they might become an<br>island so what is really resilient and<br>how is the resilience possible in across<br>the city across the scale of a city or a<br>region the poor the poor and the wealthy<br>areas it is a tricky term really and we<br>have to start really thinking about it<br>and also about what the sustainable<br>future will look like<br>so for example Greece has sixteen<br>thousand square kilometers of coastline<br>and one-third of Greeks live<br>approximately the distance of two<br>kilometers from the coast how could we<br>build a sustainable future for our<br>economy our businesses and our<br>communities and how is this possible<br>when we have to compete with such<br>phenomena so the question here is not<br>just a simple linear question that has<br>to do with landscape or climate crisis<br>but it also consists of our economies<br>community's social activities and<br>ourselves as individuals and as<br>businesses probably or practices and of<br>course in all of these crises we have<br>used in the past we have been part of in<br>the past we're using temporary measures<br>which is there fine there is a crisis we<br>need to do something but is it enough or<br>may I may I say that some of sometimes<br>we tend to find that these temporary<br>measures become a little bit more<br>permanent on the temporary than they<br>should be<br>so do we need something far bigger do we<br>need a plan or a strategic vision that<br>actually allow us to design or<br>incorporate all these future phenomena<br>in our lives and also how could we avoid<br>the mistakes of the past<br>how can we say and evaluate what we have<br>been doing so far and turn into<br>something positive if it's not good<br>enough or improve it if it's good and<br>then something that sometimes sometimes<br>ourselves even even though we work in<br>this area of climate crisis we also do<br>we think sometimes of climate crisis and<br>emergency something far away something<br>where you know our area or our friends<br>family community they're not going to be<br>affected but is it true it's really far<br>away or is it somewhere very very close<br>to home really<br>and what what the phenomena I've been<br>showing the last couple of years<br>well a lot couple of years the last<br>decades but the last three to five years<br>they're actually really building up so<br>we often underestimate the impact of all<br>this we evaluate and examine these are<br>separate problems we have a float or a<br>draught or fire and this is part of<br>climate change but no please see there<br>these factors all these assets are all<br>interconnected these are parts of the<br>crisis or an emergency and I would like<br>to call it and then allow me to address<br>one of the elephants in the room today<br>what a pandemic possibly do for in<br>relation to the climate crisis could be<br>19 coronaviruses coronavirus we've heard<br>it so many times over the last month two<br>three four or five months but actually<br>what I would like you to think today is<br>the relationship with with air pollution<br>floods fires droughts and climate<br>phenomena so I'm taking the example of<br>China just because it was the first one<br>so we have official results from lots of<br>the Earth Observatory and have a look<br>here so we have January 2020 this graph<br>shows the air pollution the nitrogen<br>nitrogen dioxide over China and look at<br>February just one month later there is<br>evidence that change is at least partly<br>related to the economic slowdown falling<br>following the outbreak of copy 19 the<br>corona bars but this is not what I want<br>to show you I want to show you the next<br>slide where we have February compared to<br>April May<br>so still a month ago but look at this we<br>are doing the same thing again so we<br>stopped for a bit fine air pollution<br>went down logical sensible and now we're<br>doing exactly the same thing it's not up<br>to 500 micro mol as it was before but it<br>is up to 250 microphone so<br>we're doing the same thing we we stopped<br>for a bit but now the economy is<br>actually growing we keep going so I<br>would like to say that we've all<br>experienced or still experiencing the<br>coronavirus differently and and it I<br>think from what I've collected and<br>gathered from colleagues and friends and<br>practitioners that it's fair to say that<br>we've all turned to open spaces nature<br>and areas of contemplation with one way<br>or another so the question here is why<br>is this suddenly so important why we've<br>learned to appreciate nature and the<br>power of freedom and opportunity to walk<br>or cycle just in a fire in a 5-month in<br>the last five months and I'm not saying<br>everyone has done it but there is a<br>general sense that all of us have<br>actually urged to go outdoors much more<br>than we wanted to go before that we were<br>allowed to so we've turned to nature and<br>back to the landscape but it is gonna it<br>was here it was there this time you're<br>going to be there next time hopefully we<br>won't have a similar crisis in the near<br>future but is it going to be there and<br>have we wonder what is the impact of all<br>activities to all this so I would like<br>to propose something I would like to<br>propose that we need a fresh pair of<br>eyes we need to think and see things<br>differently and we need to actually<br>address our lives our businesses our<br>economy in a different way so as<br>individuals but as also as landscape<br>architects designers planners whatever<br>we are we need to design or go grab out<br>our lives with something or someone else<br>in mind either this could be future<br>generations they could be animals they<br>could be nature or so much more and we<br>need to stop planning you know with our<br>only focus the economy yes of course the<br>economy is important I'm not coming from<br>another planet but we need the community<br>to be part of this when in the economy<br>will come and<br>if I dare say I think we'll be even more<br>successful if the community is there and<br>also as part of these crises that we're<br>living in the last five months we have<br>heard phrases like nature takes back<br>animals take or take sorry nature takes<br>over our cities animals take over our<br>cities etc but do they actually take<br>over or do they take it back and<br>something that probably belongs to them<br>for a little while or is it a<br>coincidence that they've sensed that<br>we've been finally been quiet for a<br>little while and they've got out to<br>explore the cities while we're exploring<br>the great outdoors for them and if I<br>dare say it seems perfect time perfect<br>from these pictures back perfect day for<br>a city tour and also they and to keep<br>the two meters distance as well so they<br>know what they're doing about so with<br>these in mind let's think so what do we<br>do what what landscape architectural<br>design and planning could do about it<br>and how how or what do we mean with<br>low-carbon landscape or or you company<br>to landscape carbon neutral zero carbon<br>etc I tend to use an example of<br>buildings because not because it's easy<br>but because it's a little bit easier to<br>understand either in our mind so when<br>you design a zero carbon building or<br>carbon neutral building you think we'll<br>we think ventilation facing the Sun<br>insulation materials some of our some of<br>the ingredients of this but landscape<br>how can we do that how we can design<br>space and open space a region a big area<br>and make sure it is really sustainable<br>or low carbon or zero carbon whatever<br>you want to call it and I think this is<br>about feelings it's about community<br>communities it's also about social<br>identity is not just about materials and<br>buildings and engineering work so I<br>would like to take you through three<br>models<br>of children today three different<br>projects strategic design and<br>large-scale projects I would like and I<br>would like to clarify now that each<br>country in region has different<br>conditions obviously so these models<br>demonstrate principles that applied to<br>their countries but I think most of them<br>are or some of them also apply to<br>different countries and again all of<br>these qualities so what you see here is<br>climate or the patient is on quality<br>transformation decision-making etc all<br>of these project have them somewhere<br>within their processor framework but I<br>have just picked the key what I think<br>there's a stronger point for each model<br>that doesn't mean that the others don't<br>have it and of course their little<br>asterisk their policy that runs through<br>across all of them so the first one<br>climate adaptation and design quality is<br>a big strategic landscape design project<br>it is about climate adaptation it has<br>two main goals it had has been completed<br>water safety and special quality we're<br>talking about the room for the river<br>program it is actually spread across the<br>Netherlands in 34 different locations<br>and an address is there what a safety<br>problem obviously there was a rising<br>level or four different rivers and more<br>it is about special quality as much as<br>it is about water safety and this is the<br>key with this project these program as I<br>call it it has a huge impact on the<br>region which shows so far a big scale as<br>well and also it has impacted on their<br>legislation and laws so how have they<br>done it we have they have designed when<br>they were billing its they decided on<br>nine different ways on literally making<br>room for the river so they have from<br>water storage to removing obstacles<br>obstacles such as bridges or other<br>obstacles dike relocation die cryptic<br>bouldering lots of different ways to do<br>that but again the key thing is not just<br>about the engineering<br> not just about nine different<br>engineering ways to address the problem<br>which is the rising water levels they<br>have done it by creating really truly<br>quality landscape and I'm gonna show you<br>present two exceptional examples in my<br>opinion from base 34<br>the first one is city of Nijmegen in the<br>city of Nijmegen and length it's an<br>urban scheme and in this case it is it<br>is the biggest project of this program<br>on a budget so what it has happened they<br>have created a whole new path for the<br>river váh that it used to float we're<br>talking about enough they're creating a<br>whole island an extraordinary location<br>of businesses housing Beach residential<br>areas and terrific and cultural areas so<br>what has happened are the summary of<br>this and I'm going to go through and<br>detail in a bit is that they didn't just<br>want to create more room for the river .<br>they just wanted to give their people<br>and also community and tourists as well<br>an area where they would be happy and<br>proud to live off leave up they wanted<br>to create identity and landscape and<br>this is a summary of how they've done it<br>so you see here on number one image that<br>the Dyke here I hope you see my mouse so<br>the Dyke is there with green what<br>they've done is they remove the Dyke<br>inland by 350 meters and they are<br>literally dug the land out and they have<br>created a whole new path or room as they<br>call it for the river what has this done<br>from to waterfront they now have four<br>were different they have a brand new<br>Island areas for social activities for<br>entertainment Beach businesses really<br>high views housing bridges to cycle and<br>walk but this is not it doesn't stop<br>here this is not just about it doesn't<br>it doesn't stop here and this is a key<br>thing with<br>with a roomful river it really takes it<br>from concept down to implementation and<br>it really has this conceptual framework<br>through runs through the whole program<br>the whole program so one example of a<br>bloomin implementation I think it's<br>really really powerful is the Citadel<br>bridge it's just one of the bridges you<br>will see you saw just in the small graph<br>before and what they have done here so<br>when it's a normal day let's say no<br>float there this bridge you could cycle<br>and walk go from the one side to the<br>other but when you have really high<br>water levels the bridge floats so you're<br>forced to take the stones the stepping<br>stones so by having a bridge where you<br>can walk in cycle but then you need to<br>use stone steps when it's loaded it<br>makes us think by forcing our body to<br>make it to do something with change it<br>from our usual routes it forces our mind<br>to think and I think it's brilliant I<br>think it's about education it's about<br>awareness it's about making us realize<br>what actually climate crisis is what<br>flood means and working in living with<br>water not just hitting it hidden hidden<br>it away somewhere else as we tend to do<br>in the past some of some of our mistakes<br>so it is about education and awareness<br>as much as it is about delivery and as<br>much uncertainties about concept the<br>second example I would like to show you<br>from the room for the river has a total<br>opposite from Norwood Normandy is very<br>urban so sorry nine million is a very<br>urban location Norwood that I'm showing<br>you now it's a very rural location so<br>you will see all this area here is with<br>agriculture used to have kettles as well<br>but kettles and animals have been<br>removed with their own as I've been told<br>with her there it was their own decision<br>not from the designers all the team<br>there so what happened here is that this<br>red line used to be the dike round off<br>and I have to say that Norwood was<br>actually the largest project Oh<br>the room for the river program so it's<br>about four thousand four hundred fifty<br>hectares and the catchment area is<br>around ten thousand square kilometers so<br>it is really huge it is a big area and<br>how have they decided to address the<br>problem of water safety there well I<br>said let's flood nor world and the<br>concept was really building with nature<br>influenced by design with nature of Ian<br>McHarg so the extraordinary thing is<br>that they have made calculations that<br>you see now on these graphs coming<br>hopefully how the water will be moving<br>throughout the years and throughout the<br>rest water level is depending on how<br>high their eyes will be and have to say<br>that this is an area that floods<br>regularly every couple of years is not<br>something that it might happen in the<br>future but the extraordinary is on this<br>slides which you see almost two and a<br>half meters this is a tons of one every<br>hundred years and the next and final one<br>that it's almost three hundred meters<br>sorry three meters no three hundred<br>three meters and it's rated tons of one<br>every thousand years so you see the<br>calculations they have done in the<br>effort that it has been put into that<br>but again this doesn't stop there the<br>important bit is the next bit the<br>important bit is they haven't just<br>addressed this as an engineering project<br>they have brought special quality out of<br>it quality elements materials plans they<br>have really created areas to walk<br>socialize kayak or take the boat they've<br>even think thought how how they will go<br>about this fort here this is a fort<br>where top left image and obviously by<br>removing the dike that was at risk<br>because it is a historic feature for<br>them so they have created a natural dike<br>by Willow a Willa Forest willow trees<br>and they have even planted the trees in<br>a specific sequence and they have two<br>different cultivars two different<br>species in case something goes wrong<br>something is affected by an insect and<br>Poogie Poogie in one of them so<br>this is again a project that has to do<br>with environmental education with<br>looking the value of the landscape<br>contemplation and social benefits how<br>you turn the water you turn a water pump<br>to an area where people could go and see<br>the view of the whole area so this is<br>the first model that has to do it with<br>how concept works from from a very broad<br>levels down to the implementation the<br>next model I would like to present is<br>about is all about transformation and<br>decision making it is about seeing a<br>region differently through conceptual<br>drawings how do you evaluate and think<br>about design how do you actually create<br>or regenerate an area either this is a<br>city origin this is about the National<br>Park the West Midlands the project were<br>working on here and BCU Katherine Moore<br>and it is all about creating an iconic<br>landscape and enhancing identity of<br>place so the broader concept of this is<br>about certificate eaves how we could<br>utilize this throughout the West<br>Midlands combine Authority in the UK how<br>do you we can propose a new type of<br>National Park not with strict definition<br>that we've used to as a national park<br>and of course how we have built-in<br>collaborations citizen engagement and<br>stakeholder engagement as well as<br>policies so it is the whole project they<br>take us through an exploration through<br>drawings and visuals - - aiming to<br>building on a new iconic landscape for<br>the region it is about perceptions it is<br>about the lab putting the landscape as<br>the very core of every process or every<br>design we do in the future it introduces<br>quality of space as a vital aspect of<br>regional infrastructure and it is also<br>about seeing things differently is about<br>understanding<br>the landscape understanding what they're<br>our surroundings is it about water as<br>this graph so here or is it about<br>poverty about deprivation areas areas<br>where we could explore nature more or<br>less rivers canals using design to<br>redefine our region in a way and<br>changing perceptions by forming policy<br>and also with the support of local and<br>national governance so forming somehow<br>using design or a broader vision to<br>drive transformation and forming<br>decision-making and again again this<br>looks about the role of touring and the<br>visual the role of powerful visuals how<br>these could be very impactful on<br>transformation and again of course<br>technology how you could see the impact<br>of project on businesses social life<br>impact and all of that<br>so this he really uses the power we have<br>our designers Landscape Architects to<br>create a whole approach holistic<br>approach that has to do with<br>sustainability with economy with the<br>future of an area and then we go to the<br>next and third model that has to do with<br>natural assets assets and collaboration<br>and knowledge I need to say that this is<br>upon European project that I'm going to<br>present now and it is a collaboration<br>between the the UK in Birmingham Italy<br>Trento and Gothenburg in Sweden it is<br>called subtle systemic system and<br>sustainable approach the futures<br>interaction to urban and rural<br>landscapes and now as we see it here in<br>the UK we see it as a case study almost<br>of the West Midlands National Park<br>because it has Eric it can't demonstrate<br>how some of these ideas we're talking on<br>the National Park could be implemented<br>but the project itself using it is still<br>ongoing is one years in-house yeah one<br>one year and a half that is running now<br>so you won't see final results but you<br>will see where what the idea that it's<br>build upon and where we've been through<br>so far and I'm saying this is about<br>regenerating reintegrating our natural<br>assets and also creating collaboration<br>creating knowledge and exchange of<br>knowledge between different cities so it<br>does focus in subtle focuses on the<br>relationship between cities food growing<br>the landscape and the progress made to<br>generate holistic strategic frameworks<br>it is about institutional change as much<br>as it is about transformation and has<br>three tiers years as we say so the first<br>approach is the first year sorry is<br>holistic to build the holistic special<br>approach and framework when the second<br>is about utilizing our ecosystem<br>services and natural capital to map and<br>evaluate the landscape potential so what<br>is the value of the landscape on these<br>cities at participate and then the third<br>build support systems approach revealing<br>hidden beneficiary talking about<br>stakeholder engagement and building on<br>capacity building so we're trying to<br>establish strong narrative with public<br>and private stakeholders on this this<br>highly collaborative collaborative<br>project and built or design at the end I<br>come up with a flexible framework to<br>guide cities through something like that<br>the guys see this guide cities of on how<br>they could actually be more sustainable<br>evaluate their assets natural assets in<br>the future make the initiative who try<br>it we'll try to make it economically<br>sustainable obviously and scalable so<br>again a landscape architect's will know<br>there there's no one-size-fits-all but<br>we would like to see this being used<br>beam the principle being extracted than<br>being used in different countries<br>regions and continents and again we'll<br>probably provide some tools and metrics<br>to support some of the decision-making<br>so the three hubs as we call them UK<br>Italy and Sweden they built on local or<br>local knowledge but also they built on<br>themselves there is a very strong link<br>between the<br>gardeners of the hub Birmingham is<br>leading or creating strategy holistic<br>approach on principles and visioning<br>Trento is looking more into governance<br>and decision-making processes and<br>Gothenburg is really strong in farming<br>intrapreneurship so utilizing abundant<br>land and I have to say here something<br>similar to what I said with the project<br>before three modest remodels again is<br>not that each of these hubs do what they<br>only know they only focus with no<br>attention to the other way they all have<br>these qualities and we all try to deal<br>and address all these different areas<br>but I'm just mentioning here what are<br>the focuses for each or the strong<br>strongest point for each of the<br>locations so the first the expert the<br>building of the expertise of the UK on<br>landscape region identity and strategic<br>planning and again we spare me from<br>being a bio philic city one of a few<br>public cities there's a huge interest<br>here in terms of environmental aspects<br>Trento is has managed to create policy<br>in terms of strategic documents and<br>design areas used to develop<br>strategically planned networks or not<br>natural or semi natural areas and then<br>Gothenburg has together with other four<br>municipalities have managed to create a<br>model for mapping and matchmaking<br>underutilized<br>or abandoned land from the city and<br>giving it to new intrapreneurs new<br>farmers that they want to scale up their<br>businesses so what it is about other<br>summary it is about a landscape of<br>common good Saturn is about urban and<br>rural regeneration restoration social<br>inclusion but also most of most of all<br>it is about valuing our landscape<br>integrating our natural assets creating<br>strategic documents and policies that<br>they<br>could support our city's local<br>authorities governments etc and of<br>course is about stakeholder engagement<br>and collaboration throughout the city in<br>so I've shared with you three very<br>briefly obviously three key models that<br>I think three key projects big projects<br>that I think they're quite relevant the<br>significant in terms of climate change<br>and landscape architecture but what<br>could we extract from this so I think<br>you might have noticed already that all<br>of these have some key qualities they<br>all have a visionary concept a unique<br>might seem similar or familiar but it is<br>actually specialized unique for their<br>own area region they have a tailor-made<br>project framework for their area<br>governmental support or local sub local<br>authority support and design as part of<br>it and again they all have clear goals<br>integrated to the design and planning<br>obviously Saturn didn't see that much<br>more because we're not in that stage but<br>we're at the stage where we we're<br>creating a vision for it and now an<br>approach holistic approach for it what<br>is something that has come it's really<br>really important in these strategic<br>projects is securing design and these<br>qualities through processes and<br>legislation and this is something that<br>it is an area policy is an area that's<br>growing it's run across all the three<br>models I have presented today some of<br>the professional associations already<br>picking up this to support practices<br>support local authorities and that's<br>actually something I'm very happy about<br>that policy is becoming quite<br>significant recognized in a way in areas<br>such as landscape and climate crisis for<br>example we're doing some work here with<br>the landscape mission in the UK and<br>linking policy with climate emergency<br>and we see that these areas already<br>looking very promising because<br>individuals and designers are interested<br>we are all interested I hope so<br>but we also we need support how to do<br>that it needs to be bigger movement it<br>could be bottom up but it could also be<br>top top down approach which it needs to<br>be both in a way which leads me nicely<br>to the next slide which is about<br>communication multidisciplinarity so all<br>these projects all of them have<br>multidisciplinary teams there are<br>several layers to secure mutual<br>understanding what do you mean by<br>climate crisis what do we mean by<br>sustainability what benefits the economy<br>has for them the economy has for its<br>region or its City there is continuous<br>communication within the teams and if<br>you ask me is it easy well no is there<br>always an agreement no way but this is<br>the whole point that we put together a<br>framework we discuss we exchange ideas<br>and exchange knowledge with multiple<br>layers of interaction and understanding<br>to make sure that some of the core<br>values these strategic schemes are<br>protected and addressing climate crisis<br>as well as landscapes economies and<br>communities our core values as far as I<br>am concerned so I would like to write<br>vouch for something I would like to<br>vouch for a way forward borrowing this<br>graph from Vienna : we hopefully this<br>corporate crisis is going to pass<br>quickly let's hope and we could all go<br>back to our families friends but please<br>don't go back to normal as far as<br>climate change is concerned let's go<br>forward instant thank you very much for<br>listening to me coming here tonight<br>thank you for this very inspiring<br>lecture and you know it's very timely<br>here in New Zealand as we became co-lead<br>19:3 some days ago so we are very very<br>excited about it congratulations a lot<br>thank you and we are very excited about<br>what the future will be holding to us in<br>your future and so now it's time for the<br>questions and you can either<br>ask the question directly to anaesthesia<br>or you can type your question in the<br>chat box and we're going to start with<br>the question that creates Cameron wrote<br>in a chat which is sea level rise will<br>mean that our urban coastal areas will<br>look different in the future the key<br>questions seem to be what can we do what<br>can we realistically do and what do we<br>want our place to look like in the<br>future are these questions included in<br>approaches you have discussed yes these<br>are really key questions but they are<br>included they are included in all of<br>them one way of in all the or the other<br>so for example the room for the river<br>they I described it very very quickly<br>but this is actually a process that took<br>them from the floods of 1993 1995 up to<br>2015-16 when I visited it when it was<br>finalizing it so it took them from 95 to<br>realize that they cannot keep going like<br>that to 2015 to actually put it in the<br>ground and implement it so you the key<br>thing is exactly what you're asking<br>creases the city the region the the<br>stakeholders that take part of that they<br>really need to sit down and think what<br>do we want our city to look like in the<br>future or region or area or community<br>and this is something we also do in the<br>National Park proposal and Saturn is<br>passing upon that as well so we're<br>having workshops with stakeholders<br>sitting down trying to make them think<br>or draw or design or you know create<br>ideas about why what they would pawn<br>their areas to look like it's not a<br>simple answer obviously and it's not<br>such an easy thing we say we want to do<br>put a sustainability neighborhood label<br>in every kind of our neighborhoods or a<br>cycler routes in in every location<br>because the key point is what does it<br>look like and how how do we make sure<br>this is this brings the<br>quality we want to have from the future<br>so yes um<br>to answer your question they do include<br>it I couldn't go through in very I mean<br>we wouldn't need the Electra for each of<br>these projects in a way to go through in<br>very in very detail but these are the<br>process they have followed to do these<br>are stakeholder workshops community<br>workshops public workshops either<br>through drawing or designing or<br>brainstorming to bring these out from<br>the designers themselves as well as the<br>public hope that answers it okay another<br>question from people Somerville and<br>thank you great projects deeds<br>development proposal or proposals<br>considering the carbon footprint after<br>physical works of development slash<br>intervention so footprint huge<br>discussion we are only talking this<br>applies only to the Netherlands so far<br>because well in a bit bit in Saturn the<br>the National Park proposal is now ready<br>to take off so it has been a research<br>proposal so far and we have discussed<br>we're now discussing with the region and<br>the city of how we could actually start<br>not building the start putting it in to<br>ground a little bit more deliverable<br>implementing it in a way but not<br>implementing it with a sense of building<br>something but thinking about it in a<br>broader scale so for the for the first<br>projects the room for the river it was<br>carbon footprint has been considered I<br>don't have the numbers yet but as you as<br>you would expect it has been a huge I<br>mean the emissions for creating<br>something like an island for example in<br>the Indiana area nine million it they<br>were huge they were really big however<br>they have calculated that throughout the<br>years and with a benefit that they have<br>from flawed and all the other benefits<br>they have from special quality as well<br>as economic benefits in nature it has<br>been it will build up in the area<br>somehow it's it's equal<br>of course they've had three or four<br>major British spins up so we're talking<br>about a quite big carbon footprint and<br>again the Norwood area there was there<br>was lots of activity to create this<br>project but these have been calculated<br>and they're constantly new tools as part<br>of force as far as you know the general<br>kind of landscape area footprint it<br>becomes a significant part of the<br>project there are a few tools simple so<br>far but there are few tools couple of<br>tools to calculate your carbon footprint<br>and that takes me back also to what I<br>said the work we're doing also in the<br>landscape interested because we are<br>trying to put together something - not<br>to calculate but work with areas that<br>could support practices in that aspect<br>as well so the second which is National<br>Park<br>there's no food being put in on the<br>ground because there's no nothing built<br>but obviously you could consider us food<br>bring you know they like carbon<br>dioxide's we all I mean trying to work a<br>lot even about computer today and then<br>with Saturn which is the European<br>project there are smaller calculators<br>calculations of footprint in terms of<br>the farming the agricultural activities<br>and some of the strategies that have<br>happened in other areas for example<br>trend toys specific activities with<br>tourism with agriculture and farming at<br>Hollis Gothenburg and so these are being<br>thought and trying to put together the<br>tool that I mention that we might be<br>producing by hopefully by the end of the<br>project it tries it tried it will try to<br>take us from them over all the big scale<br>Oh what what relevance to STDs for<br>example of the IPCC agenda this project<br>has down to a bit of more detail like a<br>level of carbon footprint and how could<br>the city's plan implement or avoid<br>something like that in the future or<br>integrated<br>and thank you for that and anyone else<br>having questions don't forget to unmute<br>yourself if you are planning to ask a<br>question everyone's<br>there is another comment in our chat box<br>Chris came back to us and said most of<br>those projects look expensive what are<br>your thoughts on some lower cost<br>response options money is an issue<br>always yes they are expensive I mean um<br>the last one sutter's not so much I mean<br>it it is it is a combination it is a<br>collaboration of the European Union with<br>the cities and institutions so there is<br>much funding on that say but I guess I<br>sense you're talking about the overall<br>you know the final design for example of<br>the National Park and also of the room<br>for the river yes there there is quite a<br>significant amount of money that have<br>been spent in this project but before I<br>answer your question on on lower-cost<br>options that there are some do it it's<br>up to you of how you do it I would like<br>you to think what I'll say also to when<br>I consult people our clients is don't<br>just look on the money that you spend<br>right now but look of how much money if<br>you just about money how much not just<br>money for me but also interests Therese<br>social pride landscape identity will<br>bring to your area or to any area in the<br>future so you might spend some money<br>today but actually this will come three<br>four five and ten times back in the<br>future it might be for these strategic<br>projects because this is not just a<br>small park or a garden not a martial how<br>to cut horticulture so don't I don't<br>enter underestimate gardens obviously<br>I'm doing them or designing them all the<br>time but it's somehow trickier to<br>calculate the years or you know when you<br>save these money or have this money back<br>but it has been proven and the room for<br>the river because it's now running runs<br>for four or five years it is proving but<br>actually it's it integral it brings<br>tourism it brings businesses it brings<br>economy even even local stories but also<br>visitors so to answering to go to your<br>question about<br>lower-cost response options yes there<br>are I mean everybody tries to save money<br>but again that has to do with sitting<br>down with your depending what you are<br>cities local authorities teams<br>multidisciplinary teams and really<br>evaluating what are the costs what are<br>the expenses and how we could you could<br>save money by creating something billion<br>there are brilliant examples out there<br>that they haven't spent smaller-scale<br>usually come to mind haven't spent a<br>huge amount of money but actually they<br>have created great input so yeah I<br>wouldn't I wouldn't say no because<br>you're asking for my thoughts of<br>strengthening you wouldn't say no in<br>lower cost responses just make sure from<br>what I could say that you don't lose or<br>miss value quality of safe space and a<br>place where people could be and leave<br>with just thinking about money because<br>this is where I think we've been losing<br>the plot a bit in the past I'm not<br>saying it's not important I'm not saying<br>he's not an issue and I'm not saying<br>it's not going to be a big issue of a<br>calf there covet but we have to find<br>ways to remember my last life go forward<br>instead of going back to where we we're<br>keep the good things and and you know<br>inventing something bigger or nicer a<br>fourth question from Vandross what are<br>some quick wings that can be done<br>specially as postcodes upset budgets no<br>try fully fully understand so I guess<br>you're talking about what we could what<br>could we do as practitioners or as<br>practices in a post copied scenario I<br>guess even if I might clarify to me it's<br>not like I see the chart so please<br>clarify to me it's not but and I'm not<br>I'm not pretend to be an expert on that<br>because very simply we still don't know<br>what in my sense we still don't know<br>what has hit<br>when I know in Australia and New Zealand<br>you're free virus Reena and happy to go<br>about our lives but there are areas that<br>have been hit much harder I know that<br>there is a big discussion with<br>practitioners and also with professional<br>bodies for example the Greek Panhellenic<br>Association as well as the landscape<br>into that I am in touch of how they<br>could support the practices so some of<br>these quick Queens that you're asking is<br>collaboration I would say we we need to<br>really work together as individuals as<br>well as practices in a post covered<br>world and we need to try to invent or<br>convince the clients that this is<br>something that it needs to be done one<br>really really significant thing that<br>I've put it in the beginning of the<br>lecture of the talk it was that people<br>have actually realized they last for the<br>past four or five months how important<br>open spaces are how important green<br>spaces landscape farms whatever they<br>have on their surroundings are so I<br>think this is something we really need<br>to pick up on with we shouldn't let it<br>pass us as professionals if you are<br>talking about the professional field and<br>we really need to make it convert it or<br>you know shift it quickly to say well<br>this is what you're missing this is what<br>it is important at the end of the day so<br>why are you just not doing it or why are<br>you just do you want stuck in what you<br>have been you know doing in the past or<br>common practices etc I'm hoping I am<br>kind of touching what you're asking just<br>let me know if I don't any last minute<br>questions from our audience from our<br>participants very very quiet and and<br>it's do you like just to wrap it up um<br>what's your biggest advice for landscape<br>architects in the future what's what you<br>expect this<br>that we need to upscale and be prepared<br>for hmm well that goes to myself as well<br>I guess as an advice I think we need we<br>really need to believe and get out there<br>of what we are capable of because I<br>think there's still a big issue and it<br>is addressed in lots of discussions I<br>have with emerging professionals as well<br>as you know the established bodies is<br>that people have the feeling of well<br>professionals have the feeling that<br>people public let's say or local<br>authorities don't know what we could do<br>as a landscape architect and I'm not<br>saying it is easy<br>I'm not saying tomorrow we're gonna have<br>phone calls saying yes hello you could<br>could you do that but we might have when<br>we call so they need to push we<br>currently we are the people but we are<br>the intermediate we could design a whole<br>area and we could actually bring the<br>vision to life<br>most of I'm not that's not - that's not<br>to offend any of the other professions<br>as I said myself I'm also horticulturist<br>my background is horticulture and<br>agriculture before I become landscape<br>architect and I'm working very well with<br>all the disciplines but it is about<br>teamwork as much as it is about really<br>making the point of what we're capable<br>to do just as an advice I think doors to<br>earth all of us is stay connected and<br>really push and take out of the box in<br>terms of even though it might not be<br>easy even though it might not be the<br>cheapest option even though it might not<br>be the most convenient option or not<br>what is already in policy and easy to do<br>finishing two months for example we<br>really need to push and create something<br>unique something that you know it will<br>be there for the future generations it<br>will be there for nature for animals as<br>I said we need to swing think with a<br>fresh pair of eyes I guess that's our<br>that's my my final mmm suggestion if I<br>have to summarize it<br>very well um there is just another<br>question to pop in in a chat box and<br>let's just take this money as the last<br>one someone is asking you know there's<br>evidence when our economic growth slows<br>slows down due to Kofi 19th that the<br>environment has recovered significantly<br>do you have any idea that what's why<br>landscape planning can help people<br>living under the circumstances of<br>economic regression which I think<br>something that will be deeply affecting<br>us over the next couple of years I<br>reckon yes probably<br>um well I don't have a full answer oh I<br>don't have it you know these are<br>questions that I think they come to us<br>as we speak and obviously we're all<br>still experienced covered and a big and<br>I actually had a I had the moment of<br>photo should I put it in or not but the<br>link the link with the environment has<br>been made to me so apparent over the<br>last two three weeks that we're kind of<br>going not going back to reality but you<br>know kind of things are improving or we<br>know where we stand so I think that<br>landscape planning or designing or<br>whatever you call it could really be it<br>could be the point where we either go<br>forward I'm really using this last slide<br>and I hope you know it's because this is<br>being live stream as well it's not mine<br>the art was there on the on the graph<br>but it is I think it's very powerful<br>graph but going forward instead of going<br>back to normal we want to go back to<br>normal in our friends and lives and<br>family but as far as the climate crisis<br>is concerned please let's go forward so<br>I think the key or the idea I have about<br>landscape planning or designing of how<br>we could leave with the economic<br>regression it will be try to think and<br>find ways to go forward it's not going<br>to be easy again we might be heat<br>because economic depression means no<br>money means less project<br>but the projects we do they might be go<br>back to Ben<br>Ben's I think or Chris question about<br>saying do we have any more low-cost<br>solutions and there are low-cost<br>solutions if it does that we have to put<br>more effort or more hours to discover<br>them and this is this is partly what<br>we're trying to do with Saturn try to<br>support local authorities it is and<br>institutions to really find ways to<br>improving either they either they<br>sustainable agenda or they political<br>agenda etc and I think because this is<br>obviously this is a project has been<br>heat from Covey's I'm standing to share<br>my client to say that there is more to<br>come from that because you know there<br>might be some answers we might have next<br>year of how you could do that on<br>landscape are the result of Kovach<br>covered in there and they're good<br>economic depression sorry I know it's<br>not the full answer obviously but this<br>is ongoing so we are just experiencing<br>needs so it's very is very hard to make<br>and you have conclusions at this stage<br>on that note thank you very much<br>anaesthesia for joining yes all the way<br>from Birmingham and I think it was an<br>excellent lecture and very very<br>interesting questions that um I think<br>will be in the back of our mind for the<br>time being and on behalf of the New<br>Zealand Institute of landscape<br>architects in Victoria University of<br>Wellington thank you very much for for<br>joining us in this webinar and all the<br>best to you and to everyone else that is<br>joining us from across the globe thank<br>you very much for inviting me and great<br>great to have a such a big audience and<br>early in the morning for your time or<br>you know across the world so thank you<br>very much I really enjoyed it thank
