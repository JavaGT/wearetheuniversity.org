The Awards recognise sustainability best practice across the region’s tertiary education sector.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>So the idea was really to have an<br>immersive week of activities related to sustainability.<br>So we hosted 13 events and workshops.<br>We did, we ran competitions, giveaways.<br>At the individual level, we really pushed for changes in people's own lives.<br>So, one of, some of the events we had were we got boomerang bags to come in<br>to show people how to make their own reusable bags.<br>We had SAFE come in to talk to people and give them tips about how to eat a more plant-based diet.<br>And we had a good balance between those smaller events and the big panel discussions.<br>I brought various student sustainability groups together<br>who had different areas of expertise and interest and that super groups about<br>sharing resources and articulating a strong student voice on sustainability.<br>Victoria University of Wellington aims to be a world-leading, capital city University<br>in sustainable development and this student-led initiative has made a<br>significant contribution to the development of a culture of awareness<br>about sustainability issues at the University.<br>We hope that they really gained an ability to feel empowered themselves and<br>feel like they could actually take action in their everyday lives.<br>I think that the event has started a lot of new things for Victoria.<br>We've got a few campaigns off the ground, like at the moment we're trying to<br>do a bit of lobbying around waste at the<br>University.<br>And we've been able to develop those relationships with the Sustainability Office<br>at Victoria and begin to lobby them on some issues and begin to have more of a<br>student presence at the table, talking about issues of sustainability.<br>But we think there's still a lot of work to do and we're hoping the<br>Sustainability Committee can be a forum for getting that momentum going.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
