Based in the idea of life economies and a life drive, Tim will give examples ranging from the 1950s new town of Harlow in Essex to Jacques Tati’s influential film Mon Oncle.<br><br>Tim Waterman is Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture History and Theory at the Bartlett School of Architecture UCL. His research addresses imaginaries: moral, political, social, ecological, radical, and utopian. This forms the basis for explorations of power and democracy and their shaping of public space and public life; taste, etiquette, belief and ritual; and foodways in community and civic life and landscape. <br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims at bringing together practitioners, scholars, students and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good morning

world it is great to have you with<br>us here in new zealand and it is my<br>pleasure to welcome you to this lecture<br>by taming waterman as part of our<br>thinkers and doers lecture series my<br>name is bruno marquez and i am the<br>program director for landscape<br>architecture and stainer dingo waka<br>victoria university of wellington<br>so these thinkers indoors lecture series<br>access bringing together practitioners<br>scholars students and the wider<br>community of landscape architecture and<br>affiliated built environment disciplines<br>to share ideas and to hear the latest<br>innovations in the field especially in<br>our current situation of coffee 19<br>through initiative of to apt water or<br>the New Zealand Institute of landscape<br>architects and the Wellington branch and<br>the landscape architecture program at<br>Victoria University of Wellington our<br>objective is to bring together<br>nationally and internationally renowned<br>experts so our second speaker in this<br>lecture series team Waterman is an<br>associate professor of landscape<br>architecture Easter in theory at the<br>Bartlett School of Architecture UCL<br>London<br>his research addresses the imaginary the<br>moral political - social ecological<br>radical into token in these forms the<br>basis for explorations of power and<br>democracy and ear shaping of public<br>space in public life text etiquettes<br>belief in ritual and food wise in<br>community in silico<br>civic landscape in landscape civic life<br>in landscape<br>he's at work on a book titled landscape<br>citizenships and has recently edited to<br>others landscape in agency critical a<br>sayings with ed wall and the Rutledge<br>handbook of landscaping food we<br>it's inert which I highly recommend you<br>to rate both he is just informing that<br>he stepped in as the new chair of the<br>landscape research group congratulations<br>I'm sure it's an team is thrilled and<br>the talk that he's about to present as a<br>title of unclear architectures cleared<br>security and life economies and he stunk<br>explores how models of care involving a<br>critical or queer eco critical distance<br>can provide a different frame of<br>thinking for design advice an idea of<br>life economies in the life drive she'll<br>be showing as examples that will range<br>from the 1950s new town of Harlow in<br>Essex UK X 6 UK to John<br>Tati's influential film uncle<br>so a little bit of housekeeping rose and<br>don't forget to team will be sharing his<br>screen so make sure that these window<br>will be open so you can see these slides<br>I also remind you to throughout the talk<br>and there will be an opportunity at the<br>end to pose your questions so please<br>join me in giving team a warm welcome<br>all the way from London team is<br>dangerous yours and and thank you also<br>to University of Wellington for for<br>hosting me how I wish I could be there<br>in person but but here I am joining you<br>digitally although it's wonderful that<br>also the opportunity exists for so many<br>people to attend the lecture from from<br>elsewhere<br>overseas as well so it's nice to kind of<br>be able to sense a international<br>audience out there right I will go ahead<br>oops of course I'm pushing the wrong<br>right is that working excellent right so<br>this is some this is work that is very<br>current this is what I'm writing up at<br>the moment and it's so I hope this all<br>comes across well because it's all a bit<br>of a stew in my in my head at the moment<br>this is work that was developed with a<br>student of mine at University of<br>Greenwich before I came to the Bartlett<br>School of Architecture so I'm very<br>grateful to her it was one of those<br>wonderful situations where in the course<br>of working with a student I was throwing<br>all this stuff at her and she was taking<br>it exactly all the sorts of places that<br>I was interested in going with the work<br>so there was a marvelous kind of<br>resonance occurring there so thank you<br>very much to eglee patch cows kata who<br>was going to be my co-author on this<br>paper and this will appear as one of the<br>chapters in the landscape citizenships<br>book so actually the idea of the Vonk<br>Euler of being uncle-ish or anti ish as<br>a way of approaching design is one way<br>that I'm actually going to be talking<br>about an approach to citizenship and and<br>thinking about who we are as citizens<br>and how we relate to our fellow our<br>fellow humans in in the world and<br>through our practices of design so I've<br>given you a little bit of sparkle here<br>to begin with because I think we need<br>that in our online world here but one of<br>the pieces that I'm going to be talking<br>about specifically is jacques tati z--<br>film starring Monsieur Lu who's the<br>character in the foreground there as a<br>way of discussing what it means to be a<br>von killer uncle-ish or ante ich as an<br>approach and actually what forms of<br>queerness that proposes so I'll come<br>back to all of that over the course of<br>talk so queer Futurity and life<br>economy's is the title now I'm going to<br>start by discussing an essay called<br>spinster Ecology's which came out in<br>2012 and is by a woman named Sarah and<br>soar who's a scholar of English<br>literature and the title of the essay<br>and I'd encourage you all to read it<br>it's a fascinating piece<br>it's called spinster ecology Rachel<br>Carson Sarah Orne Jewett and<br>non-reproductive Futurity so quite<br>intriguing title and I just want to read<br>you a very short passage from the<br>introduction to her essay that helps to<br>to discredit Rachel Carson's 1962 book<br>Silent Spring former Secretary of<br>Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson wrote to<br>Dwight D Eisenhower and asked why a<br>spinster with no children was so<br>concerned with genetics Benson's attack<br>its myths misogyny at best thinly veiled<br>makes legible one of the central<br>challenges to developing a queer eco<br>critical practice the status of Futurity<br>contemporary environmentalism especially<br>given the recent emphasis on<br>sustainability tends to be<br>future-oriented<br>its rhetoric predicated on matters of<br>inheritance and procreation alike a<br>popular environmentalist slogan asks<br>what will your children breathe a<br>proverb widely invoked across the<br>environmental movement that insists that<br>we don't inherit the earth from our<br>grandparents we borrow it from our<br>children Rachel Carson was herself a<br>spinster spent her life a spinster I<br>know that word is not an easy one to<br>speak nowadays it's easy to say bachelor<br>but spinster is somehow a loaded term<br>but she was the author of Silent Spring<br>was a lesbian had although you know<br>didn't necessarily identify in ways that<br>we might have lesbian identities<br>nowadays but had a long-standing<br>relationship and a series of very<br>passionate letters with a married woman<br>with whom she was very close I think<br>it's also useful to note on the original<br>cover of the book here that she writes<br>about the sea and the relationship to<br>the sea and I'm going to be making a<br>brief reference to Elspeth probe ins<br>work and she's based in Sydney Australia<br>and remarkable thinking about our<br>relationship with the ocean that that<br>that actually has some bearing upon what<br>I'll be discussing over the course of<br>this talk also on the cover here with<br>Rachel Carson her sweet lovely face<br>there she questions our<br>attempt to control the natural world<br>around us that direct form of control is<br>something that Carson was very much set<br>against she wanted to work with nature<br>and it and that's very much underpinning<br>the whole of contemporary ecological and<br>eco critical practice in in the present<br>day I'm gonna argue too a little bit<br>later on in this talk that this didn't<br>originate with race with Rachel Carson<br>that these were ideas that pre-existed<br>we tend to think of contemporary<br>environmentalism as being founded in<br>Rachel Carson's work and in that image<br>of Earth from space from the Apollo<br>missions earth rise and the blue marble<br>image and the Whole Earth Catalog and<br>these kinds of things but there's it's a<br>really a much older story so here are<br>some of the words from from Sarah and<br>soar in her spinster ecology the figure<br>of the spinster practices in a bunk<br>Euler form of stewardship tending the<br>future without contributing directly<br>towards it now Emma Sora's argument is<br>sin is a interesting and complex one in<br>that it talks about transitivity and in<br>transitivity a transitive relationship<br>in in linguistics or in language is is<br>one which a conclusion is directly led<br>to so it's very much like giving birth<br>to a child one you know the cause and<br>the effect have an immediate relation<br>there there there's no oblique<br>relationship there at all<br>but what answer is saying is that<br>someone like Rachel Carson's relation to<br>the future is one of being more like an<br>aunty to it she doesn't have a direct<br>relationship to it and this is something<br>that's fundamentally part of a queer<br>engagement with the world<br>worth stepping back here just for a<br>moment to to say that I like to use the<br>term queer in its very largest sense<br>queer in in one way just means odd<br>anyone that doesn't quite fit in anyone<br>that can take the position of the other<br>to me has the right and the and the<br>ability to use the word queer as a way<br>of of questioning as assuming the voice<br>of the other and this can be everything<br>from the indigenous other to the<br>colonial eyes other - to the queer other<br>in the case of Jacques Tati which I'll<br>come to later that other is actually the<br>bachelor and in some cases it's not<br>Rachel Carson's lesbian 'ti that's at<br>issue here but in fact her spinsterhood<br>which is a queer identity for a society<br>which is heteronormative hetero<br>patriarchal and which seeks to see a<br>progression down the generations<br>the image here is from Alice a recluse<br>low militaire a turn of the of the<br>century work in six volumes of of<br>geography and which I very much find the<br>sense of environmental ecological<br>awareness arising much earlier than with<br>Rachel Carson and I will come back to<br>that and also a quotation here from from<br>Elspeth probin who talks about the idea<br>of the word athwart and the word queer<br>being related that it's it's about being<br>across something about being transverse<br>coming across ideas in a way that makes<br>them different so to be queer in the<br>sense of the interfering indo-european<br>root here means to trouble - - to<br>agitate<br>- cause new meanings to arise and for<br>those of you who haven't read this book<br>by Elspeth probin it's it's it's truly<br>remarkable she talks about it<br>our entangled human relation with the<br>oceans really really interesting work so<br>but I'm going to - to speak now about<br>Harlow in Essex now some of the work on<br>Harlow is the work of my conspirator<br>here<br>eglee Patrick of sky - so I won't go<br>into too much depth about Harlow it's a<br>new town egg lay happens to live in<br>Harlow and she's got a great<br>relationship with with the museum in<br>Harlow and some of the imagery from it<br>is is is wonderful its Harlow is a new<br>town that was founded in the early 1950s<br>and yellow is the character that jacques<br>tati plays in many of his most famous<br>films including play time and mon oncle<br>Harlow was known as pram town so here<br>you have the epitome of reproductive<br>Futurity this is out in front of the<br>Woolworths in the arcades in the new<br>town of Harlow a garden city planned<br>just outside of London within reach of<br>the transportation systems and in the<br>post-war baby boom and also in a town<br>where the the majority of the designs<br>for the buildings the apartments the<br>houses were were geared at families with<br>children this is the kind of scene that<br>that that you had no of course this this<br>really is an image that you see before<br>the inevitable outcome which is that and<br>a population of a town like this tends<br>to age all at the same rate so what's<br>pram town now becomes wrinkly ville<br>later<br>so Harlow's of really a very interesting<br>place from from from that perspective to<br>um Richard horns II in a book that<br>probably should be more noted than it is<br>this Bibb in the architect he talks<br>about the the way that the the town of<br>Harlow was part of a whole sort of<br>post-war heteronormative project for<br>Reproductive Futurity a time in which<br>queer identities were marginalized a<br>time in which in fact that you found<br>queer identities and queer behaviors<br>much more criminalized as well that that<br>at that time the the heat takes Harlow<br>to be quite a strong example of that<br>kind of set of forces that are occurring<br>that's not entirely what's happening<br>with Harlow and in fact fredward'<br>Gibbard it's designer has a much broader<br>vision really of what might be possible<br>and actually gibbered has a very<br>landscape based vision for the<br>development of Harlow over time Harlow<br>was influenced very strongly certainly<br>in the mindset in Britain of the time<br>from the Britain can make it exhibition<br>at the Victoria and Albert Museum in<br>1946 this is also covered in the Richard<br>Hornsea book I think one thing that<br>you'll notice from the diagram on the<br>left is that there's an awful lot that<br>the Britain can make it exhibition has<br>in common with the design of<br>contemporary consumerist establishments<br>such as IKEA you can see that there's a<br>pattern of arrows on the floor that are<br>leading you around a series of exhibits<br>that are intended to to slowly show you<br>the various life styles that might be<br>available to you here's what you can<br>wear here's how you should live here's<br>the gear here's the kit here's here's<br>what you need to become the family of<br>the future in Britain there are some<br>resonances here that weren't in place<br>when the work began with the one-way<br>circulation systems that have developed<br>in Britain around the need for social<br>distancing with coronavirus I've no idea<br>how that's going to fit into this<br>research if in fact it is at all but<br>that's I think just another example of<br>the way that actually research<br>particularly in a time like this is is a<br>bit of a muddle things are coming in<br>from all sides influences are coming in<br>from all sides and the ground is<br>shifting on our assumptions at all times<br>as well so hard to look at a diagram<br>with this as the with the same eyes that<br>so they here's some images from the<br>Brittain can make it exhibition this<br>must have looked marvelous to to<br>audiences in 1946 just you know from<br>having lived in collapsing buildings<br>during the war with bombs raining down<br>overhead this must just have looked like<br>a vision from a nearly impossible future<br>so the utopianism at the core of this<br>was was was important<br>a driver towards the future but it was<br>also driving towards a very particular<br>vision of of the future<br>let me come back briefly to Harlow our<br>visions of modernism modernist new towns<br>and of modernism in general tend to be<br>that it's about the total erasure of<br>sights and a kind of rewriting upon a<br>tabula rasa what the city might possibly<br>be that's not in fact the utopian vision<br>that's at work in Harlow and through<br>this I want to begin to show a little<br>bit how Gibbons vision differs from the<br>way that our expectations of modernism<br>are to arrive even in this town that we<br>see is that as this as the stereotypical<br>pram town so it's modeled on the Palacio<br>de Lara joining in Padua and you can see<br>that there's a great deal of similarity<br>architectural II spatially and in terms<br>of the use of the space in the practices<br>that that space holds within it in in<br>Harlow that are all considered as part<br>of the design and which shows that that<br>Gibbard the designer is thinking about<br>far more than just the families that are<br>going to be living there he's thinking<br>he's creating scenarios for a whole<br>society that might live in this town<br>simultaneously you can also see that<br>there are Palladian references certainly<br>any architect at this time would have<br>been steeped in Palladio despite being<br>also highly influenced by Bauhaus<br>modernism and so there there's very much<br>a set of narratives from the past that<br>are being projected into the future in<br>the streetscape of Harlem Newtown in<br>Essex<br>let me talk about no future now this is<br>one end of queer theory where the idea<br>of the death Drive is is paramount I<br>think what we might have been seeing in<br>some of the the work at Harlow is you<br>know these this idea of the life Drive<br>of Eros of the fertility of the human<br>species and of the cultural and social<br>fertility of spaces such as the Palazzo<br>della ragione and Padua but no future<br>becomes the tagline for a book by Lee<br>Edelman around the turn of the<br>millennium who talks about queer theory<br>and the death Drive Edelman makes a<br>nihilistic and in some ways I think<br>simplistic but important parallel<br>between the fact that queers don't have<br>children and what we might be living for<br>we might be living entirely in the in<br>the moment so he speaks about usually<br>songs in the Lacanian sense of<br>jouissance<br>which is speaking about sexual release<br>and orgasmic release rather than a<br>deeper sense of jouissance that might<br>have historically existed in in the<br>french language and again I'll come back<br>to that a little bit as well so he's<br>talking about a certain sort of<br>senselessness he's talking about then<br>the need just to to blow everything in<br>in the present as being one of the<br>things that marks out the fact that that<br>queer life is without Futurity so to me<br>this is very bleak and this is the kind<br>of thing that Edelman says in his book<br>which<br>is rabble-rousing incendiary polemic and<br>which for me actually forms a nice kind<br>of backdrop to push off against that<br>that that this is this is a you know<br>almost a kind of ridiculous statement<br>here that that you know the social<br>order the child you know who needs<br>the future we're just gonna party like<br>so Mon Oncle<br>you lo 1958 Monsieur Yolo is a character<br>and I think very very interesting in<br>terms of what he represents not only for<br>comedy and film and the way that it<br>develops but actually in the<br>relationship that comedians can have<br>with their subject coming at things from<br>a slightly transversal oblique angle<br>from a sort of avuncular angle and in<br>Mon Oncle the character of Monsieur you<br>know the gentleman with the pipe on the<br>bicycle is a queer figure not a gay<br>figure but a queer figure he's a<br>bachelor and Jacques Tati himself<br>actually an older bachelor which in 1958<br>is something you don't see much of and<br>which is up for question certainly at<br>he himself was 37 years old when he was<br>first married to a much younger woman so<br>he had also kind of lived this life what<br>what happens in Tati's comedy and I<br>think this is really important for the<br>work of design is that it's<br>observational its he's watching what<br>happens and he is magnifying the way<br>that people move through the city they<br>would the way that they practice their<br>everyday lives this is very different<br>from for example the way that Charlie<br>Chaplin works with comedy where it's<br>about invention and it's about his own<br>body language<br>Tatia is much more interested in working<br>with what's there and that I think is a<br>very important message for design and a<br>very important message about a certain<br>kind of critical distance just watching<br>observing and allowing the life of the<br>city<br>attention between the Old Town the the<br>the crumbling city that's that's further<br>crumbled during the war and which has to<br>be replaced at speed in order to house<br>people in the post-war period and tatty<br>looks at this with affection and he<br>looks at everyday life in the<br>traditional city with affection and it's<br>often taken that he looks at the<br>modernist city with a very critical eye<br>or a jaundiced eye but in fact if you<br>watch Tati's films carefully he's using<br>the same powers of observation the same<br>sort of critical distance when he looks<br>at the old city and the new city both<br>he's reserving judgment he's leaving it<br>for you to make your decisions and these<br>kind of system built buildings that he<br>sees before him here Monsieur ello as he<br>passes into the<br>new town built hastily of necessity<br>people must be housed he's just looking<br>at it and seeing people doing what<br>people do whether it's in modernity or<br>normal there's a form of irony with<br>which Monsieur ehlo views human life<br>which I think actually shows a different<br>way in which post-modernism might have<br>gone instead of the sort of hard or more<br>cynical forms of irony that we find in<br>post modernity your Lowell posits a kind<br>of gentle irony a form of romantic irony<br>that that that is more forgiving I think<br>than much of the hard-edged irony in<br>post modernity so here we see the<br>traditional city nothing much gets done<br>life moves at a slow pace the the<br>sweeper is forever sweeping up and never<br>really sweeping anything into a pile at<br>all cafe life is there and in the modern<br>city this is the villa arpel the arpel<br>family is the family for whom Monsieur<br>Lowe is the uncle very sort of<br>heteronormative family and the woman in<br>the foreground there in the red dress<br>and the outlandish hat is the spinster<br>figure who they try to match up with<br>Monsieur you lo and and it doesn't quite<br>come to pass forgive me I'm drinking a<br>whiskey I know that this is it's 8:00<br>a.m. and 8:00 8:35 in New Zealand it<br>here's the floorplan of the villa arpel<br>again it shows this kind of regimented<br>but peripatetic sequence of events<br>through which you might move I in this<br>space to come back very briefly to to<br>Harlow<br>here's Fredrick gibbered here's an<br>actual picture of him and this is a<br>marvelous image of given that that came<br>from the that the town museum in Harlow<br>out of their archive and to me this<br>shows gibbard himself as the avuncular<br>figure as the figure of the avuncular<br>architect that that uncle figure who<br>offers a sort of queer take to the<br>family that the heterosexual parents<br>can't possibly bring now I realize that<br>there's made have nothing to do with<br>Gibbard zone sexuality but it does posit<br>an approach and I think you don't have<br>to be queer or see yourself as queer to<br>take a queer position or for that matter<br>to take an avuncular position in many<br>cultures people are called within the<br>society auntie's or uncles so their<br>relationship is actually outside of the<br>bonds of the consanguinity entirely but<br>they're still part of a human family<br>that lives in a location so interesting<br>to think that that the position that we<br>might take as designers might be as<br>auntie or uncle there's also an<br>indigenous sense of family that I think<br>is really useful particularly you find<br>this in Native American indigenous<br>sensibilities that family is something<br>that's not nuclear but rather that's<br>gathered and when you're gathering a<br>family I mean uncertainly<br>as a as a gay uncle I have many nieces<br>and nephews who have no blood relation<br>to me whatsoever but they're part of my<br>gathered family part of the community<br>that I built at large just a brief<br>comparison here of gibbered and you know<br>the idea that that that men don't have<br>to father something into existence but<br>that they can still tend it they can<br>still care for the world around them<br>without feeling a direct responsibility<br>to it that sort of critical distance I<br>seem that I probably need to move more<br>quickly but I want to move at least a<br>little bit before I finish through the<br>idea of life insurgent and to come to<br>thinking that's not mid-century but<br>early last century and that is rooted in<br>this man's thought who many of you may<br>never have heard of before but elysee<br>reclue was a remarkable geographer and a<br>common art he was a survivor of the<br>Paris Commune<br>and his six volume book lamella tariffs<br>opened with this frontispiece which<br>anticipates the image of the of the blue<br>marble or of earth rise from space and<br>the epigraph here la mulana to upon on<br>conscience<br>Delon mem hume humans our nature<br>becoming conscious of herself talks<br>about the way that our species perhaps<br>is an awakening consciousness of nature<br>doesn't separate us from nature at all<br>so we are all on some uncle's of nature<br>in this particular idea many of the<br>ideas that gibbered was using many of<br>the ideas<br>underpinning the the modernist city<br>which jacques tati miss you know did not<br>specifically dismiss we're coming from<br>people like Patrick Geddes Geddes was a<br>friend and follower of reclue and<br>recluse work really comes through in<br>Geddes work almost consistently<br>throughout there's an Atty between<br>ecology the idea of the valley section<br>and the development of human life<br>world's human practices in landscape and<br>the development of landscape is a<br>dialogue between people in place which<br>is something that we nowadays more and<br>more are taking as the assumption of<br>what landscape is is constituted of and<br>I'd love this picture of Geddes isn't it<br>what a handsome man and here is Geddes<br>attempting to map out an ecology of<br>place folk and work acts deeds facts<br>thoughts and dreams the utopias that we<br>dream at the same time as the life ways<br>that we live in the world the this is<br>one of what Geddes called his thinking<br>machines fascinating fascinating to look<br>at so so what well worth reaching into<br>that particular history to try to find<br>out more about these but there's not<br>time Geddes talks about what he calls<br>life insurgent and insurgency to me as a<br>model that I think we need desperately<br>at this point in time in a world where<br>we're geared towards constant revolution<br>towards the overthrowing the constant<br>rewriting of a tabula rasa never-ending<br>restructuring and disruption and<br>rebranding insurgency talks about a<br>surging up with wit a surging up from<br>within<br>pulling the past into the future<br>transforming the actual into the<br>possible<br>always thinking about what is not yet<br>what is not yet been realized what what<br>hasn't yet arrived and what we can help<br>into the future not necessarily as<br>fathers or mothers but as aunties and<br>uncles<br>and what it might mean to have enough I<br>think here again is is a place where the<br>the uncle or the auntie posits a whole<br>bunch of superfluous possibilities to<br>the child and to the future of humanity<br>that that are more than just having<br>enough just just an austere minimum they<br>actually talk about future ways in which<br>people might flower and flourish that<br>are also ways of having enough so<br>enoughness to me in actually includes<br>the notion of the superfluous and the<br>festival and more and more that can come<br>of us as a species of the moment<br>and here's the queer theory that goes<br>with that Hosea saban Manos his word<br>cruising utopia the then and there of<br>queer Futurity he talks about the<br>education of hope the education of<br>desire about the way that the other the<br>queer can pull the future into existence<br>as something that is better and more and<br>so avuncular architectures then is the<br>title of what will this chapter will be<br>and it's predicated in those ideas from<br>Sarah and Sora and the avuncular but<br>also in the work of on real Aviva the<br>Fabri who talks about the city the<br>landscape the countryside as works over<br>time that are collective that require<br>fathers and mothers and children and<br>aunties and uncles and gathered forms of<br>family and he also provides us something<br>that I think is really valuable a<br>broader reading of the idea of<br>jouissance which is translated in the<br>title of an architecture of enjoyment<br>for love EV includes not just the idea<br>of joy or or the Lacanian sense of kind<br>of orgasmic release but it also talks<br>about boner plasia volupte and joie so<br>well-being happiness flourishing joy the<br>festal voluptuousness sensuality all of<br>these things are contained in that sense<br>and Lefevre as well like below is not<br>saying well it's traditionalist or it's<br>modernist he's saying those things exist<br>in both of those constructions and we<br>can have bad traditionalism or we can<br>have bad modernism or we can do it<br>with an eye on the future and an eye and<br>eye on human flourishing and human<br>togetherness I'll try to wrap up here<br>quickly he's really talking about the<br>the fullness of human experience the<br>full range of human togetherness and<br>heavens what a time to be thinking about<br>togetherness I can't wait to the till<br>till we can get back to that again and<br>what a moment in Britain as well I'm<br>almost embarrassing Barriss to be<br>speaking to you from a country that's so<br>badly governed we're jealous of your<br>government in New Zealand I have to say<br>so we're not talking about an abstract<br>utopia we're talking about a utopia of<br>human togetherness human flourishing<br>that is about asking questions of the<br>future in the here and now and about the<br>practices that humans employ in the<br>present so I'll leave you with this<br>image of Monsieur Lo and his nephew<br>looking out over the traditional city<br>but I think that this is the landscape<br>that we have before us to that looking<br>ahead we have to think about our forms<br>of togetherness we have to think about<br>the stance we take as designers and what<br>that means for citizenship how we work<br>together as a species to be not only<br>part and parcel of our own<br>socio-cultural flourishing but of the<br>flourishing of the planet as a whole<br>and all of the other species with which<br>we share it and the ways that we come to<br>live with the even the inorganic nature<br>of the world around us so I will leave<br>it there and then throw it open for<br>questions and hopefully there are more<br>observations that we can take<br>in from here Thank You team for this<br>very inspiring presentation I'm sure<br>that everyone's virtually clapping they<br>are biased I think was great to have you<br>know a very interesting perspective from<br>all those different altars and while<br>people start warming up for questions<br>and I was just wondering do you think<br>it's all those interesting people that<br>you talked about are they the guncles of<br>landscape architecture i i've been<br>called a Gunkel myself I'm not I'm not<br>sure if it's a term that that that I<br>it's just an ugly compound word all<br>right<br>so opening to all our participants any<br>questions and don't forget to unmute<br>yourself Hannah I'm singing maybe I can<br>start off thank you very much - Hannah<br>Hopewell good evening to you I I really<br>enjoyed your your journey and and you're<br>taking us through some things which I<br>haven't seen put together in any<br>particular way like that before<br>I'm I'm pretty familiar with queer<br>theory and its kind of interface with<br>eco could you know you know you affect a<br>criticism and eco criticism and so on<br>and how there's a real tension in here<br>and I feel like that was the backdrop to<br>a lot of your work around Rachel Carson<br>and elderman and so on so I guess what<br>I'm saying is my own work has that<br>approach to future which happens here in<br>the now and it's very much about<br>sidestepping I guess the the modernist<br>inheritance of overcoming and the<br>revolution and so on so I really<br>appreciate you voicing so ellegua<br>eloquently elegantly rather that that<br>leaning or that orientation to the world<br>it's it's not it's not a kind of bearing<br>that we hear much about what stick i<br>mean there's many things that interest<br>me but what sticks out sort of most<br>obviously is you know nature whether its<br>capital in or small in and in how within<br>our own discipline how nature is held<br>still seems to be dragging in the last<br>century or so on so how do you go about<br>speaking to nature with your students or<br>or you know and your own and your own<br>work nature is such a vexed concept<br>there's there's a wonderful book by lisa<br>gar force which is just came out in the<br>in the last year and it's called green<br>utopias and it has a really astute<br>analysis of environmental movements over<br>the course of the 20th century and the<br>ways in which we've related to them so<br>that the the and from a utopian<br>perspective it's really useful because<br>you're talking about processes of world<br>in you know what what what donna haraway<br>talks about is world and the making of<br>whole worlds and what sort of world are<br>we coming from that enables new worlds<br>to come into existence certain worlds<br>are only possible from from from certain<br>worlds so Garf worth tracks the change<br>in attitudes to nature there's the you<br>know you you have this i won't be able<br>to pick up her her arguments just off<br>the cuff but but she does you know kind<br>of talk about the way that the language<br>of stewardship changes and<br>maybe it's it's important to think about<br>the way you know sort of in the 1970s we<br>were talking about the planet as as you<br>know a finite resource whereas now we're<br>talking much more about entanglement and<br>and our our active engagement with with<br>nature as an idea and as a form of<br>worldin so I feel that our concept of<br>nature is something that is evolving and<br>has significantly evolved to allow the<br>worlds that we posit for the future to<br>become very different from what was<br>possible to project in the 1970s for<br>example we have the possibility of<br>seeing ourselves as entangled with<br>nature as embodied beings as being<br>natural ourselves as you know our<br>ability to see the city as human habitat<br>and that perhaps even the synthetic<br>worlds that we find ourselves in might<br>in some ways be as natural as a beaver<br>dam or all of those sorts of<br>associations are possible now annette<br>new materialism and karen barrage and<br>and that sort of group of thinkers have<br>been very influential in regards to<br>landscape were beginning to sort of move<br>into discourse in a kind of organic way<br>but but with their argument isn't isn't<br>therefore you know capitalism then<br>becomes a part of nature and it brings<br>up the perhaps less vitalistic sides of<br>the wielding that they also impinge upon<br>our kind of everyday and it's my feeling<br>at times that that leaning you know that<br>entanglement and that in the discourse<br>and the orientation with them their<br>teens just sort of eat it out<br>our political and our political<br>entanglements I guess and that the<br>political kind of obligations I think<br>that kind of come with stewardship<br>whether that's an unpopular stewardship<br>or otherwise and and yes so that space<br>around a kind of political dimension of<br>nature and how nature as I mentioned and<br>held I think we need to move into that<br>area I think as as landscape<br>practitioners somehow yes I think it's<br>fascinating and I really enjoyed how<br>you've tracked that change which is<br>radically different from what it was<br>thirty years ago right you know with<br>cybernetics and then of course all the<br>materialist kinds of kinds of thinking<br>the idea of capitalism hinges upon a<br>misconception of the natural world and a<br>misconception of Darwinian evolution<br>which speaks about nature being read in<br>tooth and claw and the survival of the<br>fittest and dog-eat-dog and these kinds<br>of things that is not the way evolution<br>and the natural world works that species<br>tend to work by mutual aid it is the<br>fittest species the fittest species<br>survives which is best fitted to helping<br>itself survive and working with other<br>species to further its existence<br>so some mutual aid the idea that Peter<br>Kropotkin<br>brought in and which again Patrick<br>Geddes and at least a right clue were<br>very much influenced by is a model IIIi<br>think I think you know what it tells us<br>that's useful is that in the future we<br>might still have markets in the future<br>we might still have forms of exchange<br>but they might be based upon systems of<br>mutual aid and that capitalism is not<br>the only possible market it's not the<br>only possible<br>model for a human association and human<br>political engagement and in fact<br>politics needs to be based in landscapes<br>in substantive landscapes in order to be<br>political at all<br>I mean I don't want to take up any more<br>time but just to throw out there at the<br>moment I'm working with a group of<br>fourth-year students and we're working<br>at a on a greenfield development site<br>under the proposition that there'll be<br>no personal property ownership so we're<br>working through there and and in looking<br>you know using forms of commoning gifts<br>to begin to kind of try to understand<br>what might be possible<br>you know what imagination for landscape<br>comes up if you somehow truncate the<br>notion of private property ownership so<br>it's kind of fun well I thank you very<br>much thank you thank you Hanna team<br>there's a question from a participant on<br>a chat box and the question is how can<br>we benefit from avuncular architecture<br>in this pandemic nowadays who in the<br>pandemic I mean maybe it goes back to<br>the question of mutual aid and actually<br>thinking of the ways in which we support<br>each other there's so much that the<br>pandemic has done to show the ways that<br>we organize the city and the way we<br>organize our lives tend to shut us off<br>from one another and the fact that we're<br>in artificial isolation has actually<br>given us an opportunity to to step back<br>and think about the way that we relate<br>to each other normally what we've come<br>to see as normalcy I mean maybe it's<br>best to to use that idea of seeing your<br>neighbor as aunties and uncles right as<br>as some cultures do if you see an older<br>person on the street they're either an<br>auntie or an uncle you know that if<br>they're addressing you they have a role<br>in your life because they are part of<br>your community they're part of your<br>order<br>locality they're part of your landscape<br>and if as Kenneth Oh wig puts it<br>landscape is a land ship he makes the<br>point that there's a there that the two<br>terms are cognate that scape and ship<br>are cognates so we might talk about land<br>ship in the same way we talk about<br>relationship or friendship or<br>comradeship or fellowship or in fact<br>stewardship and that's an interesting<br>thing too if we think about stewardship<br>is something that's reciprocal rather<br>than just something we do to the land<br>that changes our nature with the nature<br>of our relationship there as well and<br>stewardship actually to me it feels like<br>something that's really quite oblique<br>and not direct stewardship is about<br>getting to know the way something works<br>and then learning how to go with that<br>which is a very ecological kind of<br>vision that comes back to the kind of<br>things that Rachel Carson was talking<br>about at mid-century that that our<br>relationship with with with places could<br>be oblique but still bring it into the<br>future in in a useful way<br>thank you we're just running out of time<br>but I think we can probably have another<br>question and if someone is keen to ask<br>sorry if I'm answering too long don't<br>forget to amuse yourself I team guys<br>thank you very much hopefully yeah I<br>really appreciated your talk I just got<br>I just some notes myself some girls down<br>for a second but I really like the<br>picking up on the queer transverse<br>aspect and I can't help thinking about<br>the sort of delusion idea of that and<br>maybe but also the sort of gentle aspect<br>about bringing it down to the<br>observational and working in the what's<br>here now and the critical distance but<br>it's kind of a critical closeness maybe<br>and and also the connection to you know<br>the sort of imperceptible workings of<br>how people can work you know you're<br>talking about aunties and uncles and<br>indirectness but there's kind of about<br>how you foster things or whatever and I<br>really like the discussion about Geddes<br>and his interest in the French<br>geographers and and I didn't didn't know<br>about his concept of life's like<br>insurgent but I mean he's there's always<br>a Venus tension when Gettys between the<br>overview then sort of French influenced<br>idea of the regionalism of understanding<br>the sort of the historical geographical<br>natural thing of the region and the<br>overview and so the like it was much<br>like top-down bottom-up sort of tension<br>and that's always being in landscape and<br>we haven't got rid of that and but<br>Australia you mentioned it seemed like<br>his idea of enoughness I think it was<br>his slides but seemed to go against the<br>sort of normalization thing where in<br>modernism where you have enough is just<br>enough or whatever so enough there's all<br>sorts of things in there so and I don't<br>know what I'm saying is there really<br>appreciated that you have to actually<br>get down II mean in suppose the<br>entangled aspect or to be able to see<br>those things that are insurgent and<br>Geddes was able to in somebody's was ad<br>one of the first observers of the modern<br>where he was you know identify things<br>like conurbations which no notice before<br>and so he's seeing things for the first<br>time and so suppose I'm just wondering<br>it's like the but there's some sort of<br>championing of taking account of what's<br>in here now and that's where sort of<br>utopias come from it's also a little bit<br>curious that queer in your case<br>sometimes was an entangled thing and<br>sometimes it's a person's identity which<br>I can totally understand and so yeah<br>sometimes they can be it can be<br>limitations if it's just attached<br>to an identity and so just wondering<br>yes I think not really two questions but<br>those are some observation but I really<br>appreciate that this sort of the<br>magnifying through observational<br>techniques and using what's there's very<br>landscape I think and certainly gets<br>away from the sort of top-down workings<br>so does that make sense yeah definitely<br>um and I'll see if I can sum it up yeah<br>quickly the idea of identity to pick up<br>on your last point I think is much less<br>important than practice then the way<br>that people live move through their life<br>worlds in everyday life how they're<br>judged by one another and how they<br>present themselves to one another and<br>also how we present ourselves to other<br>forms of life it is really really<br>important to I mean we have companion<br>species that pay a great deal of<br>attention to you know how we present<br>ourselves do them so thinking through<br>practice I think is really really<br>important not not through ideology or<br>identity but rather through how people<br>do things the the fundamental point of<br>view which I didn't discuss much in this<br>particular presentation but which is<br>very important to my work is the fact<br>that Ellie's a wreck glue and Peter<br>Kropotkin who had mentioned were coming<br>from continental anarchist traditions in<br>the same way as that I would insist that<br>queer thinking is something anyone can<br>use whether they are queer or not yeah<br>anarchist thinking likewise is the same<br>if we begin a design if we begin working<br>with the assumption that people have to<br>be controlled and they have to be made<br>to comply and have to be governed then<br>we have skipped over that massive first<br>step of figuring out how people actually<br>do things how they practice their lives<br>in the places they live we've skipped<br>over all of that so<br>that that's the tool for thinking that<br>anarchism applies is it just says wait a<br>minute<br>before you get to compliance and control<br>how do people live how are they<br>governing themselves how are they<br>dealing with their own lives in the<br>places they live before we step in to<br>paint any lines on the pavement or put<br>any signaling in or anything like that<br>and I think that's such an important<br>point of view for designers to look to<br>observe not to be the inventor first but<br>to be the observer so yeah at some point<br>you have to step in and be Charlie<br>Chaplin and do the pratfall but you also<br>have to take the time to be Monsieur<br>Lowe to be direct at E and to watch not<br>appreciate thank you<br>and on death note I will just try to<br>wrap it up and thank you team very much<br>for joining us all the way from London<br>and to make time to introduce us to your<br>amazing in always entertaining thinking<br>in lectures and thank you everyone for<br>attending and the second thinkers in<br>doors lecture series it seems that we<br>are being having a very international<br>audience here which is great and that's<br>all for now and in two weeks time we are<br>back with another speaker so once again<br>team thank you very much and I hope that<br>you finish your whisky and you're<br>already almost everyone else enjoy your<br>cornflakes yes we having our morning<br>coffee<br>I bring oh thank you oh no please my<br>pleasure<br>so team enjoy your evening and thank you<br>everyone for attending take care bye bye<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
