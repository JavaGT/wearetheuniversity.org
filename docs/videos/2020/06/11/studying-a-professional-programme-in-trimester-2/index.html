programs<br>here at victoria university wellington<br>and the wellington school of business<br>and government<br>thank you so much for tuning in this<br>evening um it's really nice to see some<br>familiar names pop up on the participant<br>list<br>what we're going to do is we're going to<br>talk a little bit about what the<br>professional programs actually are<br>and then we're going to work through<br>some of the options that are available<br>for trimester 2 start this year<br>before i kick off i am just going to<br>explain a little bit though what<br>trimester 2 actually means<br>because that is a common question i get<br>so we have three periods of study<br>periods here<br>at the university and we include summer<br>in that so that's our trimester three<br>period<br>so when we talk about trimester two or<br>july start<br>what we're meaning is is the upcoming<br>trimester that you can begin your<br>studies<br>so the programs we're going to go<br>through today they're all ones available<br>for you to start in this july period or<br>trimester two<br>but without further ado i'm going to<br>talk a little bit about<br>uh the business school itself so<br>hopefully<br>most of you know where we are located in<br>wellington um<br>there's a wee picture there of all the<br>campuses at the university<br>but we're located right in the heart of<br>the city right next to parliament and<br>the beehive<br>in between lots of ministries lots of<br>courts so if you know that part of town<br>if you know where the railway<br>station is then that's where you'll find<br>us at the business school<br>and the image at the very top there<br>that's rutherford house<br>so that's actually the building that<br>we're in and that's where your classes<br>will be held<br>so we're the wellington school of<br>business and government like i've said<br>uh and what that means is we're part of<br>victoria university of wellington and<br>it's where we teach lots of our business<br>and government programs<br>yeah i'm not sure if you can see the<br>image it's a little bit small on your<br>screen<br>but you will see the beehive slap bang<br>in the middle there<br>and the tall building to its left that's<br>the rutherford house the building that i<br>mentioned just before<br>so we are a capital city business school<br>and i'm going to talk quite a lot about<br>that as we go throughout our<br>presentation<br>because we really use our location and<br>we how we teach our programs a lot of<br>our academics are also based or have<br>come from<br>all the industries and businesses and<br>government around where we're located<br>we draw on lots of guest lectures and<br>there's lots of internship and<br>consultancy opportunities<br>just purely to do with our location in<br>the capital city<br>so i will talk a little bit more about<br>that as i go through<br>but a little bit of background about the<br>university itself so<br>uh here you will see some facts on our<br>slides um but we are number in the top<br>one percent of<br>the universities worldwide for a lot of<br>our subjects<br>and in particular the bit some business<br>school subjects appear there so<br>in the top 100 for for 12 subjects<br>including management<br>library management so we're really proud<br>of our ranking with<br>our top 2 overall worldwide for all of<br>our subjects<br>and the logos at the very bottom of that<br>slide there you'll see<br>that's our triple crown accreditation<br>and that relates directly to the<br>business school<br>so the triple crown accreditation is an<br>accreditation that business schools<br>worldwide strive to get<br>and it means that your qualification<br>that you get from studying with us<br>so i'm going to launch into what are the<br>professional programs<br>because you might have heard that word<br>thrown around and it's sometimes a<br>little bit difficult to understand what<br>that<br>actually means so the professional<br>programs here at the wellington school<br>of business and government<br>are professionally focused postgraduate<br>programs<br>so what that means is they're to build<br>onto any<br>previous study that you might have but<br>they're also sometimes called post<br>experience<br>and that's means where we take into<br>consideration the work experience that<br>you have<br>for entry and admission into your<br>programs but also you build<br>on that as you're studying and you have<br>applied learning<br>so we have 10 different programs here<br>the business school<br>under the professional program umbrella<br>and i am going to talk about those in<br>more detail as we go through<br>but first i wanted to mention the<br>similarities between<br>all of the different programs so first<br>when we talk about professionally<br>focused postgraduate programs<br>what we really mean is they've been<br>sculpted to help you with your career<br>progression<br>so no matter what stage of your career<br>you might be at<br>the programs are designed to combine<br>academic<br>um academic learning but also<br>professional learning and really help<br>you with whatever career goal that you<br>part of that is there's a lot of<br>networking opportunities that are<br>embedded into your professional programs<br>so that might be actually as part of<br>your course<br>some of our programs we use they're<br>built on a cohort style learning<br>so that means that students start<br>together and proceed through the the<br>courses at the same rate<br>and really learning and building<br>alongside each other<br>other programs have specific networking<br>events<br>outside class hours like our information<br>management<br>they actually hold meetups with other it<br>professionals<br>so our students get to network that way<br>but no matter what program you study<br>the professional programs as a whole<br>have a really strong community of<br>students and academics<br>around it and we hold regular networking<br>opportunities and events as well<br>alongside we also have<br>applied learning embedded into our<br>programs and what that means<br>is that the stuff that you're actually<br>going to be learning in class<br>is not only going to be applied at the<br>end of your study but also you're going<br>the way it's taught you're going to use<br>what you know from your work experience<br>and build that into your program but<br>you're also going to end up with really<br>strong skills<br>and apply knowledge that you can apply<br>directly into your your workplace as you<br>are studying<br>them a lot of our programs also will<br>draw on real life experiences<br>so your projects and assignments will<br>reflect what it's actually like to work<br>in certain industries<br>you might do presentations and<br>assessment styles like that<br>to really give you those skills that<br>you'll need moving forward with your<br>career<br>we also i've talked a little bit about<br>the campus and where we're located<br>if you haven't been to rutherford house<br>though and you can i encourage you to<br>come and look it out<br>it is a really really modern campus and<br>there's an image there<br>the top image is our library and and the<br>image below<br>actually is our dedicated student study<br>space<br>so this study space is just purely for<br>our professional program<br>students no matter what program you're<br>studying you're welcome to use it<br>so it really helps our students network<br>with their cohort of students they're<br>studying alongside<br>but also all the students who are<br>studying our other programs<br>it is also a really nice space to come<br>in and study and get away from the<br>busyness of your life<br>so lots of our students might be working<br>full-time<br>uh alongside their study or they have<br>other commitments at home maybe children<br>busy lives and their own businesses so<br>being able to study at this dedicated<br>city space is a really nice way for you<br>we also have uh some amazing academics<br>that are teaching our programs<br>and that's something i really encourage<br>you to look into with your programs<br>who is going to be teaching you our<br>academics are experts in their field<br>like i mentioned initially a lot of them<br>have been working in big industries and<br>they've been<br>um a lot of the ministries around here a<br>lot of<br>uh big firms and they're bringing those<br>expertise um<br>into that their teaching so i do like i<br>said encourage you to see who's<br>who's there we have a lot of guest<br>lectures like i mentioned as well<br>so it's really a good place to come and<br>study because you're getting that<br>hands-on lived experience<br>that's being taught you to complement<br>your academic subjects that you're<br>learning<br>similarly we have the industry<br>connections so with the image that i<br>started with which showed you where<br>we're located in wellington<br>we really encourage our students to get<br>out and really connect with the<br>community that they're studying<br>around to really help them with their<br>career<br>so we draw on the fact that we're just<br>across the road from the beehive so our<br>government programs have a really strong<br>connection there<br>same with being in wellington and in the<br>capital we have lots of ministries<br>our students can get internship<br>opportunities in those ministries<br>we also encourage and help support<br>students with consultancies through many<br>of their programs and these<br>consultancies<br>can have an international focus but are<br>usually drawn from that the<br>businesses that we have in wellington<br>and<br>we have big businesses with or even<br>small<br>entrepreneurial ones for those<br>consultancies so we really do<br>we also have lots of flexible study<br>options<br>so like i mentioned when i talked about<br>the study space<br>our students typically are working<br>whether that's part-time or full-time<br>alongside their study<br>so our programs have actually been<br>designed in a way to complement<br>students busy lives i will explain in<br>more detail when i talk about the<br>programs about how they're taught<br>whether it's evening classes or book<br>classes<br>but they have been the lectures have<br>been designed in a way that you can<br>actually fit it around<br>working we also have different types of<br>programs and i will go into that in a<br>little bit more detail in my next slide<br>but there are ways that you can decide<br>whether you want to study<br>for a smaller period or continue on to<br>doing your masters<br>a lot of our programs as well have<br>flexibility in the courses that you<br>choose<br>so i will talk in more detail about<br>whether a subject has core courses<br>so courses that you have to take but we<br>also have a lot of elective<br>courses that students can pick and<br>choose and build their degree<br>or their master's program in a way that<br>they want so<br>i will like i said explain lots of those<br>in more detail as we go through<br>but here's the staircasing so this is<br>what i was i meant<br>when i mentioned that there's different<br>levels that you can engage with<br>so if you have looked at our website and<br>you've seen that we might offer masters<br>and then we talk about postgraduate<br>certificates and postgraduate diplomas<br>what that really means is that it's a<br>family of qualifications<br>the students can decide whether they<br>want to enroll straight into the masters<br>for some of our programs<br>or lots of them have the staircasing<br>option<br>and the staircasing is where you might<br>decide to do a postgraduate certificate<br>to begin with<br>for a postgraduate certificate you need<br>to complete four courses<br>and once you've completed that you can<br>finish at that point<br>or if you decide actually you want to<br>keep going and keep studying<br>you can then take another four courses<br>and end up with a postgraduate diploma<br>the postgraduate certificate and a<br>postgraduate diploma<br>are a great qualification in their own<br>right but if you do want to keep<br>studying and turn it into the masters<br>then you do an additional three or four<br>courses depending on your masters<br>and then you end up with that that final<br>qualification<br>it doesn't actually take any longer<br>whether you'd like to staircase through<br>the qualifications or whether<br>you would like to start straight away<br>with the masters so either option is<br>also because this webinar is about<br>trimester 2 study<br>i did just want to talk about the<br>possibility of distance learning<br>now a lot of our subjects are have been<br>traditionally taught on campus<br>but with the situation at the moment<br>with the pandemic<br>while we are hoping to return back to<br>having<br>our students back on campus as much as<br>possible we will also have an option for<br>students who<br>can't come to campus for any reason so<br>if you are interested in studying with<br>us in trimester two<br>and can't make it to campus then we can<br>talk more about these distance study<br>options<br>so that is a really quick summary of our<br>professional programs and what they have<br>in some<br>similarity i am now going to talk though<br>about<br>the best program for you and and how to<br>work that out<br>so when we think about the professional<br>programs like i said we split it up<br>and depending on what your career goals<br>may be<br>so the first uh kind of category that we<br>talk about<br>is for recent graduates who are hoping<br>to<br>kick-start their career so you have a<br>bachelor's degree<br>and you're thinking about what's that<br>next step what's something that you can<br>add on<br>it's also a category where we have<br>programs for people who might be<br>thinking about a career transition so<br>you may have a fair bit of work<br>experience<br>but not in this particular area that you<br>would like to move on to<br>and study so the three qualifications we<br>have that start<br>in trimester two under this heading our<br>global business<br>our business analysis and our<br>professional accounting<br>our next category is for students who<br>might have two to four years of work<br>experience<br>and it might be in a particular area so<br>these are for students who are<br>interested in studying more about a<br>and in an area that they are already<br>currently working<br>we then split these courses into whether<br>you're interested in government programs<br>or whether you're interested<br>in our business programs so the top<br>three there<br>are governments so public policy public<br>management and e-government<br>and the bottom two are professional<br>economics and financial markets analysis<br>and the final category we have for<br>people who are at the other end of their<br>careers so<br>with at least five years of work<br>experience and the programs we have at<br>the business outside postgraduate<br>certificate and business administration<br>so this is one of the staircasing<br>options for our executive mba<br>this is for people with five years of<br>executive work experience<br>and we also have information management<br>so this is for people with at least five<br>years<br>in it work experience<br>what i want to do with that very quick<br>summary and i will go into all of these<br>programs in more detail like i promised<br>but what i want to do is just gauge from<br>you and what programs<br>you might be thinking about studying<br>with with kind of the background<br>so we're just going to pop up a wee pulp<br>thoughts<br>perfect i think nearly have everyone<br>voted there<br>so we've got a nice range so what that<br>does mean is i will be going through all<br>of the programs we have on offer<br>the plan as well is after this to ask<br>to answer any questions that you may<br>have if we have enough time at the end i<br>will be opening up for questions myself<br>but i do actually have a colleague in<br>the background<br>who is manning our q a as we go so if<br>you do have any burning questions that<br>i'm not covering<br>while i'm having a chat please feel free<br>to fire off the questions that way<br>and charlotte will be able to answer<br>them for you if i don't have time to<br>answer all of your questions this<br>evening<br>we will also follow up by email and you<br>will all be<br>sent a link to book an appointment time<br>if you would like<br>to discuss all of these programs in<br>further detail after this webinar<br>but because we have a nice mix i'm going<br>to launch straight then<br>into the master of global business and<br>talk about that more first<br>so what you'll see on all of these<br>slides at the very top<br>is the subject or the title of our<br>qualification and then underneath is our<br>short code<br>that you might also find on the website<br>so this one here the master of global<br>business<br>is a program which focuses on global<br>strategy<br>global business global marketing and and<br>how it's structured<br>is it can take 12 months of study so it<br>can cover the three trimesters<br>of study if you're studying full time so<br>when i mention the duration<br>what the the thing that will be listed<br>there is the minimum duration<br>so you can study this program full time<br>but you can also study it part-time<br>the classes they're taught during the<br>day weekday classes<br>and typically in blocks so for some of<br>our courses you might come in for two<br>hours on a tuesday morning<br>and then the next class might be two<br>hours thursday afternoon<br>so they are although their weekday<br>classes it's a little bit different to<br>undergraduate study where you're not<br>having to come in<br>every single day for those core courses<br>now this program like i said is best<br>suited for graduates and so from<br>any discipline wanting to kick start<br>their career so if you do not have a<br>background in business<br>that's absolutely fine the courses that<br>you take will cover<br>and give you a really solid foundation<br>in in business but here are some key<br>points about the program so it is taught<br>by<br>coursework so when i mention coursework<br>as i go throughout<br>what i'm meaning is it's not research<br>based so you will uh<br>the classes that you'll be attending<br>will you'll have um sorry lectures that<br>you'll come to<br>and so you won't have any research<br>components so that's what it means when<br>i mention coursework there<br>now if this program has a mix of core<br>courses<br>so like i said these core courses give<br>you a really strong<br>foundation in global business so you<br>take courses such as global strategy<br>or um managing people from different<br>cultures and backgrounds<br>and also things like accounting so it<br>gives you that really strong<br>foundation that you might need then you<br>also get to take elective courses<br>now these elective courses are there to<br>help you get the flavor that you might<br>want for your master's program<br>and the elective courses range from from<br>many across the business school<br>so some popular elective courses are<br>things like marketing and management<br>you can also take courses like public<br>policy and e-government<br>and if you take enough in a certain area<br>you can actually end up specializing in<br>that subject<br>now majority of these courses are on a<br>can be taken in a flexible order<br>so if you are studying part-time you can<br>start with the core courses or you can<br>start with elective courses<br>but we do at the very end of your<br>program we bring it all together and<br>tie it all up nicely with a live<br>consultancy project<br>so that happens in your final trimester<br>and like i mentioned the masters can be<br>awarded with a specialization from the<br>business school subjects that we<br>the next one is our professional<br>business analysis<br>so this program here is actually taught<br>from our ict graduate school<br>it's a program which takes just over a<br>year so half a year and it's for people<br>who are interested in<br>potentially becoming a business analyst<br>or careers in that certain area<br>like i mentioned it takes a year and a<br>half so it is four trimesters and this<br>one can only be studied in this way<br>so it's you it's full-time effectively<br>full-time study<br>it's weekday classes so you will attend<br>classes monday to thursday<br>and then friday you have a speaker<br>series so people working in the industry<br>coming in<br>and talking to the students and just<br>like the global business it's best<br>suited for for graduates from any<br>disciplined wanting to kick start their<br>career<br>but again anybody who's interested in a<br>career change<br>so what what it means here is you don't<br>have to have experience in this area to<br>take the business analysis program<br>this program is also mainly coursework<br>but they do have one research project<br>that students take it also is really<br>strong on cohort<br>cohort learning so what that means is<br>the students that you start with you'll<br>progress through<br>through your masters and you'll get to<br>know them really well<br>like i also mentioned it um is taught<br>over a year and a half<br>but to do with the the current pandemic<br>the first year and at so<br>first one and a half trimesters will be<br>taught purely online<br>so that means july till december you'll<br>have your courses<br>taught that way after that that would<br>return back to campus<br>and and they will have a lot of engaging<br>content while you are in that online<br>period<br>but it gives you a little bit of<br>flexibility and where you live during<br>that time<br>you can also if you're a domestic<br>student choose to enroll<br>the final program that we have in this<br>category<br>is our professional accounting so the<br>masters of professional accounting<br>this program again is good for graduates<br>but also people wanting to transition<br>career transition into learning sorry a<br>business uh<br>in accounting so the duration if you're<br>studying full time<br>is 16 or 19 months so that's four or<br>five trimesters<br>the reason that there's two uh two<br>varying<br>uh duration time is actually to do with<br>the pathways<br>so at the very bottom you'll see that<br>there are two pathways for this program<br>you can do the traditional mba pathway<br>or you can do the new chartered<br>accounting pathway and i will<br>go into a little bit more detail about<br>that and in the next slide<br>but i'll just quickly cover off delivery<br>so it is midday or evening classes<br>um and again i've talked about who it's<br>best suited for<br>and but the purpose of this program is<br>to give you the skills that you'll need<br>if you're interested in working in a<br>field in accounting<br>so you look at um accounting information<br>systems or business law or auditing<br>but we do like i mentioned have have<br>that second pathway the chartered<br>accountancy pathway<br>and that that purpose of that program is<br>to give you all of those skills<br>but also give you the technical<br>requirements for the the cans<br>so that you can become a chartered<br>accountant once you finish that program<br>so it's a really nice concise program if<br>you are interested in speeding through a<br>qualification and also to get that same<br>accreditation<br>now we're moving on to our programs that<br>you required to have two<br>to four years of work experience and the<br>first three i'm going to cover off are<br>our government programs<br>so the first one here is our public<br>policy<br>what you'll see underneath the title as<br>well we have the postgraduate<br>certificate you can enroll into the<br>postgraduate diploma<br>or the masters so this is where our<br>staircasing really kicks in<br>into our qualifications now the purpose<br>of this program is to help build the<br>skills up<br>in policy um and and we really draw on<br>like i said<br>earlier the location of where we're at<br>so the location of our business skill<br>for this qualification so<br>it can take if you're doing the masters<br>it can take 16<br>months which is four trimesters it's<br>taught in a modular or block format so<br>what that means is our core courses<br>are currently taught um so you come in<br>for a full day class<br>once every six weeks if you're studying<br>more than one course<br>those courses are back to back so when<br>you come in for your blocks you can come<br>and dedicate<br>two to three days on campus and do your<br>online or<br>distance study in between that so it<br>fits really nicely around working<br>professionals<br>now it's best suited for people with two<br>plus years of work experience<br>and relevant work experience so what<br>that means is you might be working in<br>government or not for profit or ewe<br>and so if this sounds like something<br>like something that fits your background<br>and you'd really like to progress more<br>in policy then this is a good<br>qualification<br>this one here is a mix it's mainly<br>coursework<br>but it does have um a research project<br>right at the end<br>which is why it actually turns into the<br>the four trimesters<br>you have a mix of core courses where<br>you're learning all the foundations that<br>you need for policy and you also have<br>elective courses<br>and again you can specialize so<br>specializations include public<br>management or e-government<br>but also things like health and<br>well-being so i really encourage you to<br>have a look at those electives and<br>specializations that you can do<br>it's a flexible course order again and<br>and<br>as like i mentioned the sorry variety of<br>teaching formats<br>so you've got those modular courses we<br>do have a course which is offered by<br>distance so again it can nicely fitter<br>in<br>around your your work life but also if<br>you're not based in wellington<br>and the qualification is also internally<br>assessed so it means you don't have any<br>exams<br>our second program is our public<br>management now this program is quite<br>similar to public policy and the<br>structure of it<br>but the focus is is still working in the<br>public sector<br>but looking more at that management side<br>so whether that's managing people<br>or managing our systems so that's kind<br>of the<br>this program is a little bit shorter<br>than the public policy you'll see<br>and that's purely to do with the fact it<br>doesn't have that research component<br>so this is full time it would take you<br>three trimesters<br>it's taught in exactly the same way as<br>the public policy<br>so it's the modular or block format and<br>again the people that<br>are best suited for this program it's<br>fit the same as the public policy sector<br>there<br>it has the same really similar structure<br>as i've mentioned with a mix of core<br>courses elective courses<br>an internship course that you can look<br>at taking and then in your final<br>trimester you do finish off<br>with a capstone course which ties<br>our third and final one in our<br>government programs is our e-government<br>program<br>and this one here is is for anyone who's<br>interested in the government but also<br>interested in how we can make our<br>systems better<br>and and looking at the computer side of<br>government<br>it's there for the masters so this one<br>doesn't actually have a staircasing<br>option so you go straight into the<br>masters qualification<br>it takes 16 months or four trimesters of<br>study<br>and it's taught in a similar way with<br>that modular or block format for the<br>for the entry criteria into this one we<br>do i like you to have a relevant<br>bachelor's degree<br>in the but also our relevant work<br>experience as well<br>and again it's a really similar<br>structure with with the programs that<br>i've just mentioned with a mix of core<br>courses and an internship<br>and it does include a research paper in<br>so moving on from our government<br>programs we're now going to look at our<br>business programs<br>so the first one here is our<br>professional economics so our<br>postgraduate certificate<br>in professional economics now this<br>qualification<br>here is just offered as the postgraduate<br>certificate<br>so it doesn't have the traditional<br>staircasing option<br>but if you are interested after you've<br>finished studying this qualification<br>we do have a new masters starting next<br>year that we can help you transition<br>into so if you are starting this<br>qualification in july it's our last<br>intake and it will take you one<br>trimester if you're studying full-time<br>or two trimesters if you're looking at<br>studying part-time<br>it's a program that is best suited for<br>people<br>with two years of relevant work<br>experience and a bachelor's degree<br>in in economic statistics and<br>mathematics or something with a<br>the courses that you choose from here<br>will give you a really solid foundation<br>in professional economics<br>so the courses you can choose from a<br>macro economics<br>economic relationships in the empirical<br>context behavior economics<br>business cycle analysis and implications<br>so if you are interested in taking this<br>this qualification<br>have a look on the website for these<br>these courses you'll find out<br>more about them if you are interested as<br>well you can also put an applied finance<br>course into the mix<br>so it's a really good qualification if<br>you're interested in economics with a<br>little bit of finance<br>we also have our financial markets<br>analysis so again this is similar to a<br>professional economics<br>it's our postgraduate certificate and<br>this is the final<br>intake into this program the purpose of<br>this program is similar to professional<br>economics but with an applied<br>finance application so again we do like<br>you to have a background in economic<br>statistics mathematics finance<br>anything with that quantitative focus<br>the courses under this one here are the<br>ones i've got listed on the screen<br>and you can also take a professional<br>economics<br>course into your program if you are<br>interested in<br>now we're moving into the final category<br>for<br>our programs here so this is for people<br>with five plus years of work experience<br>and the first one i'm going to talk<br>about is our business administration<br>so this business administration<br>qualification the postgraduate<br>certificate<br>is the stepping stone qualification for<br>our executive mba<br>this qualification is really good if you<br>want a we like to call it a general<br>qualification so it will give you a<br>really strong foundation in business<br>so to help you if you're looking at<br>moving up into senior leadership<br>you get a really strong sorry strong<br>foundation and<br>you take an accounting course you take a<br>leadership course and managing and<br>leading people<br>and marketing management so it gives you<br>all of those skills that you may need<br>but also you get to take elective<br>courses again to give it the flavor<br>and match your interest so this uh<br>postgraduate certificate<br>it will take you six months so two<br>trimesters of study<br>it's only available so available to be<br>studied part-time<br>and this is to do with our strong cohort<br>structure<br>that is implemented throughout this<br>program so that<br>i'll explain a little bit in more detail<br>about the courses that you might take if<br>you're taking this part this program<br>how it's structured is it's taught in<br>blocks so what that means is every<br>fortnight<br>our classes are offered and they might<br>be on fridays or saturdays<br>or a mix of both depending on what<br>courses that you're taking<br>so this program works really nicely for<br>students who are working full-time<br>due to the part-time offering of the<br>study but then also<br>when we offer the individual classes<br>like i mentioned it's best suited for<br>professionals with five plus years of<br>work experience<br>um and so what that really means is<br>management<br>experience or executive experience so if<br>you're holding a leadership role<br>currently or you're working in that<br>space<br>then this is a really good program to<br>consider<br>the courses that you'll take for this<br>program i've got listed now on the<br>screen<br>so in your july trimester you'll take<br>economics and<br>strategic operation management and in<br>your second trimester<br>which would be over the summer period<br>you would take strategic marketing<br>innovation and entrepreneurship i<br>mentioned before the cohort learning<br>approach so our students in this program<br>get to know each other really well and<br>make very strong connections<br>it's also internally assessed so you<br>don't have exams<br>and there's a focus on professional<br>development as you go throughout your<br>program<br>so we embed professional development<br>into your courses<br>and if you were to continue on to do<br>your full master's<br>there's a consultancy course that you<br>take<br>and this consultancy can be either based<br>in new zealand or you can also choose to<br>and the final qualification i'm going to<br>talk through this evening<br>is our information management so this is<br>just like our professional economics and<br>our financial markets analysis it is<br>being offered as the postgraduate<br>certificate option for our july intake<br>and we like to call it our emba for it<br>professionals so it's a program which<br>just will give you really strong<br>management in the it area<br>so just like the other two i've<br>mentioned it's a six month<br>uh so it can take six months um you can<br>actually also do it full time<br>so you can complete it in one trimester<br>if you're interested<br>it's taught through evening classes to<br>fit in really nicely<br>around your full-time work and as i've<br>mentioned before it's best suited for<br>professionals with at least five years<br>of it work experience<br>i've also got the courses on the screen<br>listed available<br>but i will talk about the um the regular<br>meetup for it<br>professionals also with it professionals<br>so that's part of the professional<br>development and networking that's<br>embedded into this program<br>so again you're getting that hands-on<br>experience early on into your<br>your qualification you'll get into<br>network and meet people<br>in the career that you can progress<br>so i appreciate i spoke very quickly<br>about those programs and gave quite a<br>high<br>level um high level<br>of knowledge so i will uh hopefully<br>you're sending questions through to<br>charlotte right now<br>and and we will send you that link to<br>book a one-on-one session if you do want<br>to talk more about those qualifications<br>and but i am just going to talk about<br>next steps and what<br>some things that you might need to start<br>thinking about if you're thinking about<br>starting your study in<br>the july period so<br>the first i'm going to talk about is<br>just thinking about what best suits you<br>i know that i did go through it very<br>quickly but think now<br>what are your goals what are you hoping<br>to get out of your study<br>is it best to start off with a<br>certificate option<br>do you have the time and capacity right<br>now to study full-time<br>and and get a qualification within one<br>trimester<br>or would you like to spread it out<br>alongside<br>um and work whilst you're also studying<br>think about uh whether you should study<br>uh or if you prefer coursework or<br>research<br>so what kind of study are you interested<br>in so these are some things that you you<br>can start thinking about and again i'm<br>here to help you with it with that<br>another thing to think about is<br>financing your study<br>so i quite a few questions i get is<br>about how are the course<br>fees actually structured is it per the<br>whole course or<br>is it to do with individual courses that<br>you may have<br>so our fees are done per course so if<br>you were to take<br>two courses this trimester that's what<br>you would be charged for<br>we also have a thing called a student<br>levy so the student levy is an<br>additional cost that's charged annually<br>and the student levy is there to<br>to cover things that support students so<br>with the student levy we're able to<br>offer our domestic students<br>free doctors so free health care<br>counseling<br>and it also supports uh student advocacy<br>around the university<br>so it's there to make sure that students<br>are supported and that they succeed<br>so one when you apply if you're applying<br>for a scholarship that i'm<br>going to talk about in a second it will<br>mention the student levy there so i<br>thought it was good just to go over it<br>before i get though into the scholarship<br>i thought i should mention study link<br>so studylink are an external uh<br>a loan provider it's a government<br>organization and they help students<br>with their student loans this process<br>can actually take a little bit of time<br>you do need to apply with them<br>in independently from applying from the<br>university so if you are considering<br>starting study in trimester 2<br>it's a good idea to have a look at study<br>link and see what documents you need to<br>provide them<br>and get your application started with<br>them you don't actually need to apply<br>uh have applied for the university<br>before you apply for study link<br>so it is something a good idea to get on<br>on and have a look what you need to do<br>i also encourage you to have a look if<br>you haven't actually studied a<br>bachelor's degree before<br>but you've got a wealth of work<br>experience and you're thinking one of<br>these programs might be for you<br>i encourage you to have a look at the<br>fees free skin which is also run by the<br>government<br>so have a look there and see if you're<br>eligible for that program<br>but the program i'm getting the most<br>questions about for trimester 2 study<br>is this trimester 2 fees scholarship so<br>this is a scholarship that is<br>administered by the university itself<br>and it's for students whose lives have<br>been affected by the covid19 pandemic<br>you're eligible to apply for this<br>scholarship if you're applying for<br>any of the programs i've mentioned this<br>evening whether that's a postgraduate<br>certificate<br>postgraduate diploma or masters the only<br>thing it doesn't cover is if you were<br>interested in doing a thing called a<br>certificate of proficiency<br>and that's where you just take one of<br>our courses but you don't want to attach<br>it to a full qualification<br>so if you are thinking about applying<br>for the scholarship it's again<br>postgraduate certificate postgraduate<br>diploma or the master's qualifications<br>to apply for the scholarship you want<br>you will need to complete an expression<br>of interest form<br>which is found on our website they will<br>then send you a link to the scholarship<br>details and you just need to answer some<br>questions about yourself a declaration<br>and then you need to write a 200 word<br>statement about how your life has been<br>affected by the covet 19 pandemic<br>applications for the scholarship close<br>on the 15th of june<br>so i do encourage you to jump on online<br>tonight if you haven't already had a<br>look or haven't already applied<br>and start filling in what you need for<br>the scholarship if you're<br>if you're eligible like we always say<br>about scholarships<br>please just apply if you're if you're<br>thinking about studying<br>because you need to be in to win so<br>definitely put an application in and see<br>another common question i get about<br>when you're thinking about studying is<br>what admission type am i<br>so the two most common that we find our<br>students might be for our professional<br>programs<br>are the two that i've got listed on the<br>screen right now and the easiest way to<br>think about it<br>is have you completed a level five<br>qualification or higher<br>so if you have a bachelor's degree<br>qualification that's level seven so you<br>you work in this first category here so<br>when you're putting in your online<br>application<br>you'll need to click qualification<br>assessment above entrance level<br>if you do this and your previous<br>qualification wasn't with<br>us you will need to supply documents um<br>showing your transcript<br>and what previous study you've completed<br>the other criteria is the criteria i<br>mentioned before so for students who<br>might not have any formal tertiary<br>qualifications<br>higher than level five but they have a<br>vast<br>um extensive work experience which will<br>make up for that<br>that so we have a criteria called<br>special admission<br>if you are applying for special<br>admission you might do need to provide a<br>little bit more paperwork so please<br>apply early just so we can start getting<br>so how do you actually apply so all<br>applications are processed<br>or completed on our website the easiest<br>way to find where to apply<br>is the link i have at the very bottom of<br>the screen there so if you go to the<br>main website<br>and then say forward slash apply it will<br>take you straight through to the<br>applications<br>when you apply you say who you are what<br>qualification you're interested in doing<br>and you also choose the courses that you<br>want to take in trimester ii<br>you can also at the same time apply for<br>trimester three<br>or you can do that at a different stage<br>whatever you decide is absolutely fine<br>you will also be told what supporting<br>documents you may need to provide<br>this for some of our programs that we<br>require you to have work experience as<br>an entry criteria<br>chances are you'll have to provide a cv<br>some of our programs ask you for a<br>personal statement<br>so to explain why you would like to come<br>and study<br>so when you apply it will list all the<br>things that you need to do<br>and you don't actually need to do your<br>documentation at the same time you do<br>your official application<br>so we always try and encourage you to do<br>your application as soon as possible<br>and then it will let you know what<br>documents you have to provide afterwards<br>then what happens when we have all of<br>your documents and we have the courses<br>you're interested in doing<br>it comes to our team and we look at it<br>for approval<br>and admission assessment so if you're<br>not too sure about whether you're<br>eligible for a program<br>you can apply and we can assess at this<br>point but if you do want to check in<br>with us first you're more than welcome<br>and you can send that through to<br>the email address our list
