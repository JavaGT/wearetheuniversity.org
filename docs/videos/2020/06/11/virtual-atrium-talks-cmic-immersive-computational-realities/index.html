This trend suggests that immersive technologies are already becoming increasingly embedded in our everyday lives and highlights the need for interdisciplinary research in that area.<br><br>In this seminar, we present a series of short talks that showcase how CMIC (the Computational Media Innovation Centre at Victoria University of Wellington) responds to this research demand and the emerging status quo of Immersive Computational Realities, today and into the future.<br><br>The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation’s Virtual Atrium Talks are a series of seminars where staff, PhD students, and external design and built environment practitioners present their current research and seek feedback from the community.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

um<br>four speakers today from simac so we've<br>got<br>um ian nadia um<br>have i said it right uh motion motion<br>that's right<br>uh sorry and daniel uh speaking today<br>so i'll i'll hand it over to them to do<br>a fuller intro of themselves<br>and um thank you very much for coming<br>along and<br>giving us this talk so i killed her<br>thank you so much um becky and regan for<br>hosting us uh let me just give me one<br>second to just<br>start up uh my screen<br>everyone can see this cool<br>all right thank you everyone for joining<br>so we are quite sure that many people<br>don't know about cmec<br>so what we're going to do today is give<br>a sampler<br>of a bunch of different talks a lot of<br>them are in vr and ar<br>and hopefully give you a sense of who we<br>are and what work we do<br>so just quickly about me my name is ian<br>i work at cmec<br>as a designer and innovation coordinator<br>where i<br>primarily do a lot of work on project<br>incubation<br>i'm also a school of design alumni so<br>i'm really<br>happy to be back here talking to<br>everyone<br>so cmx stands for the computational<br>media innovation center<br>and we're still super young only two<br>years old<br>and we're kind of based on the the<br>faculty of engineering<br>we call ourselves an entrepreneurial<br>research center<br>and what we mean by that um like what is<br>what does it mean when i say like<br>entrepreneur research right and one way<br>we can think about it<br>is that there's this horizon of emerging<br>interactive media technologies coming<br>towards us<br>whether that's real-time graphics and<br>games of increasing realism<br>or cheaper and cheaper vr and ar<br>headsets<br>and we need to ask ourselves what kind<br>of feature does this enable what kind of<br>applications does it enable and what is<br>new zealand's place in it<br>and certainly at cmec when we look to<br>companies<br>like weather digital they've really<br>proven that we can be pioneers in these<br>areas<br>but in order to do so there are lots of<br>hard research problems we need to<br>solve and address and so cmx mission is<br>to support that<br>through user-orientated and<br>industry-driven academic research<br>and naturally this means that we work a<br>lot in areas of game development<br>film production of course immersive<br>technologies such as augmented virtual<br>reality<br>and what siemic tries to do is that we<br>want to be a bridge of sorts and we're<br>very lucky<br>through our network to be partnered up<br>with<br>some of what i would argue the biggest<br>players<br>in these areas such as uh square enix<br>olm digital which you may recognize as<br>the production company for<br>the pokemon series companies like bandai<br>namco<br>and be able to sit down with them and<br>understand what<br>what is the future that they're trying<br>to make right for example what is the<br>future of games what is the future of vr<br>ar experiences<br>and what are the challenges that they<br>need to overcome to achieve that<br>and funnel that back to wellington<br>funneled that back to victoria<br>university<br>and be able to collaborate with everyone<br>all the different schools and<br>departments and everyone here<br>and also you know all sorts of companies<br>in new zealand from startups to<br>companies like weather<br>to be able to say hey yeah we can solve<br>these problems<br>and we can turn wellington into this<br>cool little<br>innovation hub that is able to usher in<br>this next<br>wave of interactive media<br>so specifically in cmec we have a number<br>of groups that<br>are working on different things to<br>address some of these challenges<br>we have a computational media solutions<br>group<br>which is more computer graphics problems<br>doing a lot of machine learning image<br>processing type work<br>we have a group called user experience<br>in x realities who<br>about designing and evaluating<br>experimenting with new types of<br>user experiences new types of<br>interactions<br>uh and certainly also a lot of work in<br>vr and ar and we have<br>a group that i think is a little bit<br>unique which is called<br>the advanced media prototyping group<br>whose job is to take a lot of that<br>research<br>and find new applications new business<br>cases<br>new ways to apply them building new<br>prototypes<br>applications and demos to be able to<br>demonstrate the value<br>of the technology than research we're<br>doing<br>so what kind of projects do we are we<br>working on right now i'll give you a<br>sense of it<br>so this is one of them can we train a<br>computer to understand<br>the environment by using a single image<br>so for example what direction is the<br>light coming from<br>in the scene what is the material that<br>table is made of so that<br>the forms of that we have in the future<br>or the er headsets we have in the future<br>can better understand the world around<br>us<br>what are the affordances that we have<br>for<br>immersive media content such as 360<br>videos is it a new way for us to<br>interact with videos<br>is it a new way for us to create design<br>visualizations<br>or maybe a better way for us to engage<br>with viewers and create new types of<br>participation<br>as we move towards digital production<br>how might we preserve more traditional<br>2d styles that we might find in manga<br>and what makes a 3d model unique<br>what makes it recognizable<br>characteristic and how can we use that<br>information to inform<br>and help artists build better assets for<br>games for example<br>so that's me i'm gonna leave it<br>to my next colleague to dive a little<br>bit deeper and some different projects<br>and i hope this gives you a sense of<br>what kind of work we do with cma<br>right motion take it away thanks ian um<br>kia ora my name is motion and i'm the<br>interactive designer<br>at semec um i graduated out of the<br>school of architecture and design<br>and did my thesis on the topic of<br>virtual<br>reality<br>yep<br>all right so um it was after completing<br>my thesis that i realized that<br>i have a deep passion for virtual<br>reality and here you can see um<br>a couple of my mates testing out an<br>application i made called<br>the tanifa which was a horror<br>application so there was a lot of jump<br>scares<br>um and i later released this onto the<br>oculus store<br>which got a bit of traction for you know<br>maori driven games which was quite cool<br>um and this leads me to mir vr<br>which is a project i did at sema was my<br>first project<br>um i did this project actually with luke<br>and regan from the school of<br>architecture<br>and the goal of this project was to<br>create quickly<br>capture an environment so we can produce<br>um interactive simulations within that<br>environment<br>and a little bit of background luke is<br>and he did his summer scholar paper<br>right here at scenic<br>so to scan an environment this consisted<br>of<br>getting the like a scanner scanning the<br>floor<br>then generating that environment via<br>metaport and then<br>bringing that 3d generated mesh back<br>into<br>so here's a comparison shot so the top<br>top half is real life<br>the bottom is uh scanned you can see<br>that the scanned environment<br>isn't like the best you know it's not<br>perfect<br>it's a little rough around the edges but<br>the goal was to quickly<br>capture this environment so rebecca you<br>could go into the school of architecture<br>you can scan your own environment and<br>get your own simulations within that<br>environment<br>and one of the simulations we actually<br>done was a fire escape simulation<br>where the fire the goal the use of<br>goal for the user was to simply get to<br>the fire exit<br>and as time went on the fire would get<br>larger it would obscure your vision<br>super smooth and yeah this one was quite<br>simple<br>compared to our next one which was the<br>active armed<br>offender simulation where we actually<br>went by the police set by the university<br>and the police which was run high fights<br>and you know the first option if you can<br>run to an exit<br>if you can't do that hide hide<br>underneath the table<br>hide in the room barricade the doors if<br>you can't do that<br>then your last option was to fight and<br>you can do<br>all those free within our simulation<br>and to conclude with my short<br>presentation i'd just like to say that<br>vr is becoming a lot more mainstream<br>within<br>architecture projects and programs like<br>lumen and twin motion<br>actually support vr but the interactions<br>are quite limited<br>and you guys and architecture know it's<br>not just about showing the space<br>but how people interact within that<br>space<br>so i think that's where cement can kind<br>of help<br>with um you know being the avenue for<br>the school of architecture to kind of<br>help build those interactions<br>not only creating custom interactions<br>within the vr world<br>but visualizing how other people<br>um actually interact within that space<br>and with that being said i like to pass<br>daniel<br>not passing the slide oh no okay<br>so hey everyone my name is daniel i'm a<br>postdoctoral researcher here at semic<br>and i'm like i'm i'm brazilian<br>and i came and but i did my phd in<br>portugal and some of my topics that i<br>like<br>that i'm researching is virtual reality<br>and to reality<br>and and more towards the human factors<br>so<br>um my name so as i said and<br>like if you if you think about simic as<br>having like the uxr<br>ux component which is more like the<br>cognitive science and behaviors part<br>and more some in the cms where you have<br>more the the computer graphics and<br>machine learning<br>machine learning hardcore graphics i'm<br>uh so one of the topics that we are<br>addressing here at cmx is remote<br>workspace collaborations<br>so as we we can see now everybody's<br>needs to work to remote and everything<br>so<br>but in some cases people<br>you need some more context you know so<br>for example like<br>in some in in this case here you you<br>don't know<br>there are some problems for example you<br>don't know who i'm addressing<br>sometimes uh if i want to address<br>someone specifically you don't have like<br>the eye contact<br>so for example some people also don't<br>have<br>um they need to to show<br>something about their own environment<br>and this<br>uh so one of the things that we are<br>addressing here at cimic<br>and one a thing that i'm personally<br>interested in is that that part of<br>remote workspace collaboration<br>so um<br> so so<br>in in that things we can use vr ar so<br>people<br>can have a a more in a better<br>context of the real environment<br>so they can work remotely but feeling<br>at the same place so they can work<br>together<br>face to face well of course this can be<br>used<br>um this can be done by human<br>telepartition but this is like still in<br>the science and fiction<br>and it can also be uh a solution<br>and it could have been convenient to<br>travel but can cause severe<br>so this is particularly one thing that<br>we've been working on which is augmented<br>virtual teleportation<br>so in this thing people can converge<br>both virtual and augmented reality so<br>they can<br>work together live in a real um<br>in a real augmented environment they can<br>feel in the same place<br>with with like a 360 camera that<br>makes people teleport to the remote<br>so this this is done by using either 360<br>cameras<br>so one can one person in vr can be<br>teleported to a remote space<br>so they can have so they can augment the<br>environment with virtual objects<br>and they can communicate using face to<br>face<br>and uh a 360 video which is<br>which is uh put on the remote side<br>and in the local and a local person<br>can have using augmented reality<br>classes they can see their partner by<br>where the 360 camera is and they can<br>so on some so we we<br>we made some applications to showcase<br>our prototype<br>and this can benefit from face-to-face<br>interaction in spatial awareness<br>so for example this can be used in the<br>case of remote assistance<br>so someone can guide another person in<br>this case like in the<br>kitchen scenario doing recipe<br>so also training people to perform tasks<br>or to use equipment by rendering virtual<br>replicas of the environment the<br>equipment<br>and also there is the the obviously the<br>application of interior design<br>where one can have like a 360 camera<br>mounted on the<br>other place and can<br>you there's someone there with a ar<br>glasses<br>and they can communicate and be<br>teleported to the remote space<br>where they can furnish a real remote<br>room<br>so they can see like and also the<br>objects are<br>blended so they can kind of they can<br>match<br>the real world's lighting on the remote<br>side<br>and also uh the idea of remotely<br>presenting so someone can be<br>teleport teleported to like a real<br>classroom or the other way around<br>and can communicate and um<br>and showcase elements of the<br>so uh so that said<br>we we we we have some future research<br>directions on this<br>uh augmented virtual teleportation thing<br>um<br>so for example this is still limited to<br>one<br>to one uh collaboration so in the future<br>we want<br>to pursue like multiple users in both<br>sides<br>and also like we are<br>only using uh audio and visual stimuli<br>so we want to go in the multi-sensory<br>direction so include<br>other senses like haptic feedback<br>smells um and everything and also<br>have uh more applications about and use<br>cases about<br>for for uh our application<br>so obviously architecture as we showed<br>um and others such as engineering and<br>medicine<br>so now i can pass my work my<br>where to an idea let's gonna talk a<br>little bit more<br>thank you daniel hello everyone from me<br>i'm nadia pandiri<br>i joined simic um a few<br>months ago like couple months ago as a<br>lecturer<br>and then of course with the lockdown i<br>didn't get the opportunity to<br>engage in meeting people around the<br>campus as much as i would have liked<br>i have an interdisciplinary background<br>across<br>psychology engineering and computer<br>science and my research is<br>primarily sorry i have the wrong slide<br>here<br>there sorry oh there's a bit of a delay<br>sorry so and my research is in the area<br>of human computer interaction<br>and sustainability so i've done some<br>research around<br>emergency response food practices but<br>also<br>kind of other aspects of more people<br>sustainability such as mental health<br>and well-being and<br>within simic i guess i'll be closer to<br>the kind of the user experience<br>group that would be my kind of natural<br>space and my specific focus is kind of<br>understanding<br>and evaluating people's interactions<br>with technology<br>in the real world i'm particularly<br>interested in people's lived experience<br>and this allows for designing kind of<br>more meaningful interventions<br>services and technologies that are<br>sensitive<br>to people's values and practices so<br>as part of this research of course as<br>you might imagine the physical<br>and built environment are an essential<br>consideration in my work<br>it is not possible to design or evaluate<br>technologies<br>looking at the lived experience without<br>considering people's embodied<br>interactions with one another<br>in their environment so architecture has<br>been<br>really kind of uh critical i guess in in<br>what i do<br>and an early example of that was the<br>slide i was showing earlier<br>which is part of my phd kind of thesis<br>quite a few years ago<br>where basically i was looking at the<br>role of kind of<br>interactive technologies in supporting<br>formal and informal learning<br>in kind of higher education spaces i<br>conducted a series of ethnographic<br>studies<br>in various kind of innovative higher<br>education buildings<br>looking at kind of how people people's<br>actual use<br>of the technology primarily but the<br>space of course as well<br>and contrasting that with the<br>anticipated use of those spaces<br>and of course as you might imagine there<br>were a number of differences between<br>what was envisioned<br>people to do in those spaces and what<br>was actually happening<br>so through that i was kind of<br>identifying different factors that<br>um allow us to account for those<br>differences and kind of almost<br>repair them in a post-occupancy type<br>scenario<br>things around kind of flexibility which<br>can be both infrastructural like the<br>affordances as we know but also social<br>legibility of spaces<br>aspects around legitimacy and sense of<br>ownership but also<br>customization uh and and appropriation<br>so as you can tell uh this is kind of a<br>um very relevant to vr<br>and simic as well because specifically<br>now within cimic my interest is kind of<br>understanding<br>and enhancing the user experience in<br>these kind of immersive environments<br>and and this is kind of as as vr and<br>they are<br>they're not new but they're now becoming<br>much more accessible<br>and and much more ubiquitous in our<br>everyday life so this is a great time<br>for kind of extending<br>the research that is currently happening<br>in laboratory and control kind of<br>settings in vr<br>to kind of people's everyday lives and<br>and kind of um<br>real world practices so i'm particularly<br>interested to kind of go beyond<br>economics and human factors or kind of<br>usability studies of these kind of<br>immersive environments and really look<br>at what does it mean when<br>you know when we transition in our real<br>life from<br>these kind of immersive environments to<br>our<br>built environment so our physical kind<br>of environment<br>um and also what does it mean for these<br>immersive environments to kind of extend<br>uh our built in physical environment<br>sorry so specifically i'm look i'm<br>interested in kind of<br>obviously what is the current user<br>experience of such spaces<br>how can we support people to inhabit<br>those spaces comfortably<br>and what does comfortably mean in this<br>scenario do we have<br>the right metrics to kind of understand<br>this kind of comfort or the current<br>experience so do we need new metrics<br>for these environments and also what are<br>kind of some of the<br>key symbolic and functional and social<br>elements<br>that allow us to kind of understand and<br>design for those spaces<br>and just to bring an example i mean uh<br>religious kind of uh buildings you know<br>turtles is a very kind of good example<br>in that<br>because people their symbolisms within<br>that built environment that kind of<br>enhance people's experience there but<br>recently we saw a lot of people do to<br>copy they had to kind of actually<br>transfer that practice into a virtual<br>environment how was that experience what<br>does it mean to kind of uh<br>what kind of elements you need to to um<br>almost replicate that kind of symbolic<br>element that you have in a normal church<br>within a vr environment or going to kind<br>of motions example earlier about the<br>fire training uh kind of uh vr<br>application<br>i mean most of us have participated in<br>in<br>fire drills in our environments but uh<br>to have a fully kind of immersive<br>experience like that that<br>you know you see the fire maybe you even<br>experience<br>the smoke or other kind of sensory<br>elements this is something that so far<br>only kind of trained firefighters<br>uh professional basically emergency<br>responders usually engage in<br>so what are the implications for<br>everyday people in kind of<br>getting that fully immersive environment<br>what are they<br>maybe ethical aspects we need to<br>consider kind of the emotional and<br>effective kind of uh<br>impact that we need to kind of um<br>consider as a kind of an after<br>of that experience to make sure that<br>people are still<br>comfortable so in short i'm<br>quite interested in how do immersive<br>environments<br>extend complement or potentially disrupt<br>our current interactions with each other<br>and our physical and build environment<br>and there are lots of examples that<br>around that<br>i mean my one of my favorites around<br>considering the disruption potentially<br>and disruption doesn't have to be a bad<br>thing by the way<br>is around food because i i have a<br>particular interest in that and vr<br>we see more and more of these kind of vr<br>restaurants happening<br>where people sit like what you see in<br>the bottom image there and they kind of<br>see virtually their food but then they<br>experience something else and there's<br>some really interesting experiments<br>uh in that space so these are some<br>really interesting times i think for<br>uh simic and and for architecture and<br>vr ar and i'm looking forward to<br>chatting some of you<br>uh if you are interested further so in<br>short<br>thank you for listening to us we would<br>love you to join us<br>check our website we have some<br>scholarships and internships as well<br>or if you just want to come and chat<br>about<br>anything i know we still cannot do a<br>fully big group<br>at level 2 but we can still meet with<br>smaller groups<br>we are not very far from the school of<br>architecture so<br>only six minutes away as you can see<br>here<br>and we are at the nec house so we would<br>love to see some of you there thank you<br>and we are happy to take questions<br>oh curacao thank you very much for that<br>fantastic presentation and it's<br>fascinating to see<br>all the possibilities that can be that<br>vr<br>and ar can be used for so<br>yeah if anyone could give a virtual<br>click<br>you can do that with your reactions<br>um please do um<br>yeah any any questions i had a perhaps i<br>could start just while people are<br>thinking of their questions how do you<br>how do you incorporate haptic and smell<br>senses into into this<br>i just could not work out in my brain<br>how that might be possible<br>well this is this is a question that we<br>we are asking as well like there are<br>some work in the literature about<br>like remote haptics so how you can feel<br>uh like a really sense<br>like have force feedback so you have<br>there there is something that is<br>really used in medical uh<br>context which is like phantom which is<br>something that<br>it resembles a pen so like<br>it's it it has been used like in the<br>medical field a long time so you can<br>feel the texture for example if you're<br>like<br>cutting someone or doing like a<br>so you can have a sense of surgery and<br>stuff<br>and but it and all the senses are still<br>like very preliminary and in research<br>phase which is like you have to to<br>to really do like some some<br>way to recreate smells and<br>try to put it back in there we<br>like in our previous lab for example we<br>we bought something<br>that and uh we tried to<br>to use it but it was not working very<br>well<br>right yeah yeah yeah that it's it's<br>basically something that we<br>we it's a question it's a good question<br>to have because it's a question that<br>there's no good answer yet okay<br>i'm very good and i forgot to say<br>welcome to victoria nadia and you're<br>very new so welcome thank you<br>um mike yes well<br>kiara thank you uh it's essentially the<br>same question as yours i think becky but<br>haptic is more than just what you touch<br>uh it is what you feel and<br>we have a collaboration for quite a<br>large number of years with<br>uh marshall day associates who help us<br>with our acoustics teaching<br>and they've just built a quasi-virtual<br>uh acoustic simulator in their<br>wellington office replicating what they<br>have in auckland<br>uh where you can listen to what it would<br>sound like in their test room if there<br>was someone in the apartment next door<br>with<br>good or bad sound absorption in the<br>wall between you who was arguing or<br>playing a stereo and so forth<br>and with these kinds of headphones you<br>can get ones that actually<br>do replicate<br>surround sound experience of being in a<br>space given<br>certain sounds being generated and what<br>the properties of the space are but what<br>we don't<br>yet have is the ability to sit<br>in a room that's cold but sit in the sun<br>next to the window and i'm certainly<br>intrigued by the whole<br>idea of having all of<br>that uh sorry someone's phoning me<br>uh and it's coming through the same<br>headphones which is really distracting<br>uh the the i i'm really interested in<br>that space of actually<br>virtually trying to experience what it<br>would be like to be in an office<br>where you have glare from the windows<br>because it's very difficult<br>to replicate artificially the sun<br>shining in your eyes<br>or even just a bright window it's<br>similarly difficult to imagine that your<br>ankles are cold<br>because there's a cold draft of the<br>window next to you but those are very<br>real<br>haptic experiences in an office that<br>vr doesn't yet get to but i wish it<br>could because<br>it's it's it's a really relevant way of<br>imagining what it would be like to be in<br>a space<br>so i'm interested in anything you want<br>to do in that area because uh that<br>that kind of thing is something that<br>intrigues building science students a<br>lot<br>uh just getting beyond predicting the<br>number to actually talking about the<br>experience<br>yeah that is indeed very fascinating i<br>and i think like you like daniel said<br>for a lot of these things it's still<br>kind of although like i said they're<br>more ubiquitous it's still early days<br>and we are really<br>it's we're still really getting into<br>grips with the more multi-sensory and<br>fully experiential aspects<br>which is why it's really exciting i have<br>heard of some studies that they look at<br>um<br>still at experimental kind of stages<br>looking at almost<br>uh what would it mean if your feet are<br>cold and that's like your<br>real world stimuli but uh but having a<br>virtual kind of experience where you're<br>by the fire<br>and whether that kind of mediates or out<br>there's your perception you know<br>they're using some of these studies as<br>ways to explore around<br>pain management for example so there's<br>definitely some area there<br>some research in that area that is very<br>exciting<br>yeah and there's also a lot of studies<br>for example in<br>perception manipulation which is<br>basically like you trick your senses to<br>feel in a way<br>that that that is real but it's not for<br>example there's some<br>recent papers at chi like the biggest<br>conference in h<br>in human computer interaction in the<br>world for example they use<br>like smells to convey<br>temperature for example or like the most<br>more classic ones that<br>like rotates the the world around you so<br>you can<br>feel that you're work walking like a<br>shorter distance than you actually are<br>and virtual reality for example so<br>it's like a very interesting kind of uh<br>feel<br>and also it's interesting for example uh<br>the thing that you said like<br>about the real world environment because<br>it's it's still preliminary like to<br>recreate<br>like to like a real condition for<br>example<br>into a virtual environment but i think<br>it's even more<br>tricky and challenging and exciting for<br>example to have<br>in our case like recreate<br>like sense like model of a<br>environment that already exists<br>and try to to capture this<br>and transfer to like a remote person<br>this is even more interesting because<br>you have<br>you you're not just simulating the<br>virtual hypothetical world<br>you're like recreating like a a real<br>remote world that is<br>even more exciting yes<br>oh thank you just one one one other<br>question too<br>uh becky for for ian and the team thank<br>you very much for that presentation<br>um and one of the sort of cunning things<br>that we did was to you know that the<br>reason we've brought you to the atrium<br>presentation the cmac team to the atrium<br>presentations<br>is to introduce the capabilities of cmec<br>within victoria university<br>now we've all seen some of the things<br>and mike for instance<br>is interested how ian and team<br>how do we actually then move forward<br>what what what what can we do<br>if if if we in in architecture and<br>design and project management<br>can see areas where you know and we're<br>exploring them now<br>i've just come out of um student crits<br>and<br>two of our three that i've just done are<br>in the vr<br>area you know ones anyway but so<br>what's the next step ian and team you<br>know how how can we<br>how can we get this conversation going<br>from from this<br>uh atrium presentation what's next to do<br>i think um first thanks reagan for that<br>very<br>concise question um i think if you ask<br>different people they'll probably give<br>you a slightly different question<br>uh answers to this but you know in the<br>past we've worked a lot with the school<br>of architecture already<br>i think mostly with rican but also with<br>dara<br>and you know we're always happy to work<br>on things like summer scholarships i<br>think that's a really great way for us<br>to test out new ideas<br>and it's also great because you know the<br>the proximity of the two<br>uh the two locations makes it really<br>easy for us to have that<br>you know collaboration um we're also<br>really interested in working on like<br>grants for example because i think you<br>know the<br>the challenge for us is that we need to<br>be able to<br>to some extent validate or demonstrate<br>the value of the work<br>the technology or the research we're<br>doing i think part of that<br>that's so great about this go<br>architecture is that<br>you often have those answers there and<br>we can lean on you guys to<br>help us frame and contextualize some of<br>the research you're doing in ways that<br>i think will better you know help us to<br>you know<br>work on projects together um so i don't<br>know that's<br>so grants summer scholarships we also do<br>have<br>um i guess a vr lab and other types of<br>equipment that we're happy to share<br>or kind of if your students want to come<br>and know more about the center or<br>you know we want some of i'm sure one of<br>any of our postdocs or researchers if<br>they want to give a guest lecture i'm<br>sure that's also on the table<br>i don't know uh nadia do you have<br>anything else you want to add to that<br>no i think what you say and it sounds<br>great like ian said like this<br>you know anything from a small student<br>project that we can collaborate to a<br>funding application<br>to we would love to you know if you're<br>interested if you would like to come and<br>present we used to do<br>uh pre-covered uh some also<br>seminar talks in simic um i think every<br>two<br>weeks or once a month the and i don't<br>know i attended a few<br>before i actually started in cimic so it<br>would be absolutely great i'm<br>planning to attend some of your seminar<br>series as well so i can get a sense of<br>people's research so yeah<br>great because i know from from both<br>becky and i<br>we are we are very very keen on speaking<br>for you now becky you haven't actually<br>talked about this but<br>the matagamari side is an area that is<br>close to both our hearts um and<br>and it's it's it's something that um<br>you know we know when we live it and we<br>understand it but we don't understand it<br>if that makes sense<br>uh and trying to sort of unpick the what<br>we should be<br>you know i should be a maori therefore i<br>should do this as opposed to i am a<br>married therefore i do this<br>it's kind of complicated um to to<br>actually get you<br>so that'll be something few now here too<br>you know if you know there's there's a<br>huge field<br>in there uh and uh motion in daniel we<br>did the scanning of the building<br>and it's coming out much better with the<br>so in on thursday morning to finish off<br>just the the final little scam<br>so okay<br>yeah actually i was going to add to that<br>actually yeah that's also something that<br>is something that's really interesting<br>for us because you know<br>with a lot of grants there's this<br>section about<br>you know vision mataranga right and i<br>think what's really important for our<br>center is that we need to be able to<br>really truly embed that that worldview<br>and that perspective and that mindset<br>into the research it's doing and so i<br>don't know if you<br>know regan we've been working we're<br>trying to work more closely with people<br>like kevin shedlock up at the school of<br>engineering computer science<br>um but yeah this is something that we've<br>had a discussion about<br>and we're definitely keen on figuring<br>out how we could<br>do that a bit more um especially since a<br>lot of the people at cmac are also<br>international staff<br>as well and so they might not have been<br>exposed to this particular uh<br>world view or perspective so i think<br>it'll be a really great experience for<br>us as well<br>no well it feels like there's all sorts<br>of research<br>possibilities and collaborations that<br>are um<br>possible here so so let's do keep up<br>that conversation<br>um because i think there's yeah i could<br>i'm<br>starting to imagine what might be<br>possible so you might get an email from<br>me<br>but thank you very much for your um<br>before your talk it was<br>it was great and fantastic to see what<br>is possible in that world which is very<br>foreign to me<br>um but yeah fantastic so thank you very<br>much<br>and next week we've got marcarelle<br>speaking at at one so<br>come along then same time same place<br>hilda thank you thank you thank you all<br>for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
