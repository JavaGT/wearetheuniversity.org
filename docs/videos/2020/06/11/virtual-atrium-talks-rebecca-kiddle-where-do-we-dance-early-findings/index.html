spine<br>Wellington day fine coal growing today<br>so today Vicky's going to be talking<br>just about where do we dance and it's<br>gonna be really interesting because<br>we're doing dad so after five weeks at<br>level four and three weeks and level<br>three and starting into level two very<br>soon we do we dance<br>so Vicky's going to talk about who some<br>of the any sort of research and findings<br>from exactly that where do we dance<br>because space can have kind of a joining<br>together a feet anyway I'll leave it up<br>to you over to Becky<br>to take it away Cole thank you again I<br>just share my screen cool so yeah I<br>thought I would and I've had to put this<br>together very quickly due to a<br>last-minute a deletion in the program so<br>so so maybe it's kind of more of a<br>conversation but this is a bit of<br>research that I've been doing with dr.<br>vaakya Abraham sir who's a environmental<br>psychologist up the hill and it's it's<br>called where do we dance and I think the<br>reason the reason I I got and interested<br>in the work was because I before I came<br>back to New Zealand in 2015 I was living<br>in China and I just was really enamored<br>by the fact that if you walk outside at<br>dusk you see a whole lot of people<br>congregated and on the corners of<br>streets don't thing you know that<br>someone's got they kind of ghetto<br>blaster to use that the words of the<br>1980s and and kind of you know<br>everyone's just gathered around dancing<br>and then you go along to the I lived in<br>a place called pseudo which is famous<br>for its gardens and you would go into<br>the gardens and you would see mostly me<br>and I have to say gathered around<br>playing a kind of type of<br>kiss and you would say this everywhere<br>and the streets are sort of lively and<br>full of people and this is not obviously<br>peculiar to China but I just really<br>loved it kind of being amongst it even<br>though I didn't really know what was<br>going on before there I lived in the UK<br>and I was just always surprised by the<br>fact that whenever it was a little bit<br>sunny people would flock to the Commons<br>and put on their bikinis and speedos<br>despite there being no water to speak of<br>to swimmin around and they would<br>sunbathe and and you know there's sort<br>of varying levels of social interaction<br>but but they were sort of gather at<br>least and of course it is the sort of<br>institution of the pub and the wicked<br>men at the top right corner even even<br>kind of inhibits these places and they<br>really kind of have been at least<br>sources of kind of opportunity for<br>social interaction in community you kind<br>of know if you move into a place that<br>you go to the local and you'll<br>potentially meet made up with with<br>someone we went on a lovely holiday -<br>Brittany once when I was living in the<br>UK and I don't know if anyone's ever<br>been to Brittany in the summer but they<br>have these beautiful festivals called<br>fizzles I think I'm pronouncing it<br>quickly where you go along to the sort<br>of center of the of the village of the<br>town and everyone joins and doing so the<br>dancing that you learn - at least a New<br>Zealand intermediate school like they<br>like it's a bit like this sort of gay<br>Gordons or all those kinds of dances we<br>had to learn it there's kids and we went<br>along to one of one of these with and<br>Iceland at friend of mine and and and<br>you just pick it up you join in and pick<br>it out they're easy and this is why and<br>there's hot dogs but the fascinating<br>thing was there was there was older<br>people there was middle-aged people and<br>there were teenagers and I thinking wow<br>you can get teenagers to hang out with<br>their parents and the middle of you know<br>a French kind of you know village<br>that's pretty remarkable and then I came<br>home actually for it for my interview<br>when I when I when I interviewed for the<br>job up the hill and I was put in there<br>was November and it was a rainy when<br>Wendy Wellington day and I was put in<br>James Cook hotel that's where I stayed<br>it was a Sunday night and I walked down<br>to Linton key and I was the only person<br>Thomas checked and I just was feeling<br>this sense of kind of ah that's right<br>New Zealand doesn't use its public realm<br>very well you know and and and so it<br>just got me thinking you know where do<br>we where do we make friends where do we<br>where we build our community and where<br>do we dance you know that was was the<br>sort of the shorthand I guess for all<br>this and just in just saying my husband<br>kind of arrived here who's British and<br>just saying that there's a real lack of<br>opportunities for him to connect with<br>people really outside of work and and<br>what have you so just exploring the sort<br>of spatial the spatial kind of<br>consequence of our urban form and<br>whether there might be certain spatial<br>things that either kind of encourage or<br>discourage that the interconnection um<br>so drawing off Ray Oldenburg's work<br>which you know many of you will know<br>about but he talks about this idea of<br>third place so our first place being our<br>home or our domestic place our second<br>place being our work or productive space<br>and then the third place being you know<br>where community happens or we we have<br>make friends or whatever and these are<br>the kinds of characteristics that he<br>talks about being important and food<br>places and some of these are potentially<br>not relevant to New Zealand at some of<br>our researchers found but but I think<br>this sort of the basic ideas that he<br>have has there is really important I<br>wonder I throw them so yeah where are<br>the the project focused on where are out<br>there places and we focus particularly<br>on suburbs because our<br>boobs are overwhelmingly domestic so<br>this scene is pretty common around the<br>country at least in terms of new<br>development you get a lot of suburban as<br>you all know you get a lot of suburban<br>morphology that looks like this where we<br>sort of drive into our garages and we<br>you know never have to say hello to our<br>neighbors if we don't want to and I<br>think one of the problems at least in<br>this so I'm not explain this for you but<br>one of the one of the issues with our<br>sort of very domestic suburbs is that I<br>think our third place and our first<br>place become the same thing so when I've<br>talked to people just in passing you<br>know what we do you think your food<br>places or we do you interact with people<br>they'll say things like well I invite<br>people around to my house for a barbecue<br>you know and and and be interesting to<br>hear your your guys thoughts about what<br>you think your third places are and so<br>so I think in New Zealand we we have<br>we've got a whole lot of private space<br>so we're never forced into the public<br>realm but we also have so much private<br>space that we're really able to invite<br>people into our homes why is that<br>problematic move on I think there's<br>three reasons why this is problematic<br>and the broader scheme of things the<br>first is that we tend to only engage<br>with people who are like us so we we<br>pre-select and we we yeah we tend to or<br>to attend to not kind of you know invite<br>someone who has a different<br>I don't know way of doing things to our<br>homes so it really kind of dissuades<br>mixing across communities I think it<br>potentially slows down community<br>integration at least that's that's been<br>an experience of my husband here and I<br>think you know that if there are no<br>signals that there are third places<br>available so there's supposed to be<br>places people don't seek them out so you<br>know that the example of the pub and<br>Breton you know you<br>know there's a pub beer you know that's<br>a food place so you seek it out you know<br>you'll kind of come across someone who's<br>local so these were our questions we<br>were looking at you know what are our<br>food places where do we congregate does<br>this differ by cultural groups or are<br>there differences between Marty non<br>Marty refugee and migrant communities<br>that kind of thing and what's the kind<br>of physical aspect to all this you know<br>zero spatial I don't want to go at it so<br>far as to say spatial set of rules that<br>encourage this but of spatial kind of<br>indications that might make it more<br>possible to interact in our communities<br>than lease perhaps so we we brought on a<br>whole lot of master's thesis students<br>and they did a whole lot of different<br>topics you know I'm just going to talk<br>about one of their findings but the<br>shantel's theses are really interesting<br>looking at shopping malls is a is a<br>third place and particularly why new<br>Mata and Johnson Bowen really fed and<br>found that they were actually really<br>critical food places and community<br>spaces and that the it's really<br>problematic that we tend to kind of send<br>these into private ownership when<br>they're actually really important spaces<br>for suburban centers and then email was<br>looking at multicultural interactions<br>and a new town elaine was talking about<br>green spaces and with the the public<br>benefit from them and central Wellington<br>I'll talk a little bit about Eleanor's<br>workers was had a great title you could<br>never have a third place in a sausage<br>factory which was one of the quotes that<br>she got from us from one of the<br>participant her child Patersons<br>participants and then grace was doing a<br>kind of general look at it Oldenburg's<br>work so just focusing a little bit on<br>Eleanor stuff she what she did is she<br>she worked with a group of school<br>children at worser basical and<br>Naama and she worked with them to<br>develop their own third places around<br>the community as a way of and she sort<br>of did a before-and-after survey and<br>interview to find out whether children<br>were more likely to be to be independent<br>in terms of their mobility in terms of<br>how to get to school on their own or<br>being allowed to go to the school on<br>their own if they had more agency over<br>the place that they were creating so she<br>found that there yeah the kind in active<br>travel of children's mobility was linked<br>to social and spatial factors so so<br>there was differently kind of obviously<br>a spatial component the year they've<br>cleared gender differences so girls were<br>less expected to be independent and<br>their neighbourhood than boys and having<br>a role in suburban place making ie kind<br>of increasing agency really really<br>mattered and it did increase the number<br>of times that children visited their<br>neighborhood you know went out and<br>explored and did things and children<br>were drawn to marginal and liminal<br>spaces and not the kind of fancy<br>playgrounds that are often on offer but<br>the sort of leftover spaces and corners<br>and behind trees and things so that<br>these kids created all sorts of<br>interventions shall we say in there in<br>the suburbs so that the the child on the<br>lift has created of what's called a<br>fidget board where people can go and<br>fetch it and that was pretty successful<br>and on the right hand side was there are<br>a couple of books book libraries around<br>the place children developed one<br>developed a teepee that their kids could<br>hide in from their family if they wanted<br>to there was a tea set and a swing lots<br>of time there's couple of tire swings in<br>fact Vicky you might notice this this<br>was done on an C shown by the<br>by the sea beer but there was a deal I<br>just love the snow there's a bit of land<br>just beside worse of a school as a<br>grassy kind of Virg not not for parking<br>but all the parents you still parked<br>their cars Lee when they were picking<br>out the kids and the teachers would put<br>lots of you know notice they're saying<br>don't park on the green Virge it's not<br>packing space and it's unsafe fuel you<br>know and so that the kids erected a tire<br>swing like this one here on that space<br>and they put up this sign keep kids safe<br>no parking and still parents continue to<br>park on this Virge and so the kids<br>decided to make their own parking<br>tickets and they put parking tickets on<br>the cars that would Park on the space no<br>more parking on the vege so you know if<br>you give kids a bit of agency they can<br>really you know change the world so onto<br>onto the city they so lucky and I did a<br>did a relatively large survey just<br>checking my pie and peak survey last<br>year I'll just motor through this<br>because and this is just me picking up<br>some trying to pick out some key stuff<br>from there because we're still analyzing<br>their responses but we looked at the<br>whole we sent out a survey to the whole<br>of the Wellington region and we've got<br>512 responses mostly or a big proportion<br>with female as you can see quite a<br>reasonable spread of Ages which was<br>pretty you know good in terms of<br>ethnicity reasonable spread we were<br>trying to we were quite keen to compare<br>ethnicities we've got I mean we've got<br>about just over 10% Marty I guess which<br>is a little bit low but yeah race<br>involves freed and we asked about<br>sexuality and you might think why would<br>you ask that situation in it it's<br>because I was talking to someone about<br>this one day and I said always where's<br>your your third place and he said oh<br>well<br>because he arrived in the country sort<br>of five years ago I think from from<br>Britain and he said I'll what she I'm<br>I'm gay and and I had a I had felt like<br>I had this really made community that I<br>could connect into and I thought that's<br>fascinating and in some ways having you<br>know having a having a certain sexuality<br>may even make it easier to connect into<br>a community then then if you're you know<br>hit residual so we tried to you know<br>draw out some of that in this in the<br>survey we wanted to find out whether<br>people had children and this is partly<br>because some of the work that's gone on<br>before by Karen wooden and others are<br>upper masse in Auckland found that<br>children were really important for<br>connecting with others and they talked<br>about how that the school gate was often<br>a third place but you know it's really<br>dodgy for someone to stand by that<br>school gate if you don't have kids so we<br>thought we better we've been asked you<br>know do people have kids and<br>unsurprisingly actually not that many<br>people didn't our and our survey so we<br>asked people how they first meet people<br>in their neighborhood and what and it's<br>not kind of surprising the responses<br>here in the squares I mean I don't know<br>if this is great but this glee is is you<br>know that the the largeness of the<br>squares are showing the the proportion<br>of the response but what I think is<br>surprising is that people still did meet<br>in the street and I think sometimes we<br>imagine that people don't use streets<br>for that purpose these days because it's<br>you know it's a little bit scary and<br>we're scared of strangers and things but<br>actually lots of people still meet in<br>the street so the street and the bus<br>stop particularly were both really<br>important moments for connection lots of<br>people liked big spaces so again I sort<br>of had this perception and maybe it was<br>just me that that people like to kind of<br>intimate spaces for you know fair<br>interaction of course some people do but<br>a good number of people really did like<br>in the purple box you know more than 50<br>people type sized spaces I can't see<br>what those cushion is are windier you<br>see finna visit the place so I guess you<br>know the read and with the readers was<br>once a week so I was just I was also<br>really surprised by that the people were<br>very regularly kind of going to their<br>their their sort of their places and<br>this one is oh the characteristics that<br>describe their place again I was a bit<br>surprised by their response because I<br>imagine that some people liked all quite<br>a few people would like sort of<br>structure and clubs and you know putnams<br>Bowling Alone talks about this sort of<br>demise of the club and how people really<br>kind of hanker after there but actually<br>if you see there the orange box down the<br>bottom that said there are you know<br>there are formal criteria for for<br>accessing the space so very few people<br>wanted that and many more people wanted<br>people to be able to come and go as they<br>pleased people from all walks of life<br>have found their there's no formal<br>criteria for membership so a very kind<br>of open kind of wanting all sorts of<br>people to be able to access these spaces<br>which I thought was great how do you get<br>there again most people really wanted or<br>walked fear so having spaces and close<br>proximity was hugely important strength<br>of neighborhood that basically half and<br>half at each end<br>you know half that they belonged half<br>didn't feel much belonging<br>so implications for the way we do built<br>environment just to finish off I guess<br>just to sort of reinforced the fact that<br>the street is a really important social<br>space and yet we I think we neglect we<br>neglect the street is a is a sort of<br>design element when we're thinking about<br>neighborhoods and we perhaps team to<br>focus our energies on kind of<br>you know particular spaces like you know<br>green spaces or parks or or public<br>squares or whatever people do know their<br>neighbors so there's something that's<br>something to build on our large spaces<br>are liked but obviously a variety is<br>needed for a whole range of different<br>kind of preferences favorite places are<br>in our our in our neighborhoods so we do<br>like those and and we should be able to<br>kind of get there by walking so each<br>neighborhood needs third place<br>candidates and I think I live in<br>Northland which has 53 Pizza Shops and<br>no kind of place to linger and I think<br>you know there's a there's a I think<br>there's a role in local government and<br>ensuring that suburbs offer lingering<br>food type spaces places for people and<br>there's kind of nothing he exit for<br>except for their lovely home I don't you<br>fill up the room and people are open to<br>meeting people not like them so most<br>people want me most people want to meet<br>people who aren't like them but they<br>just kind of need opportunities to be<br>able to do there and that's it let me<br>stop sharing thanks very much and thanks<br>for stepping in the bridge sort of<br>organizing questions I get the chance to<br>ask one straightaway do you think that<br>we are losing the ability to dance all<br>the options to dance well I I guess it's<br>interesting thinking about what happened<br>when when were in lockdown and how<br>people really didn't have it the<br>straights in a way that we haven't seen<br>very much you know in our sort of day to<br>day life if you mean by ability the<br>desire to or do you mean option brothers<br>we zoom a lot now you know the<br>technology is actually getting in the<br>way yeah maybe I mean you know I'm a I'm<br>a natural introvert<br>so I'm quite happy to kind of hunker<br>down but actually they're think there<br>comes a tipping point when you do need<br>you you do find yourself needing some<br>actual face-to-face interaction I mean<br>we were just talking people with Peter<br>and others in Victorian now this this<br>morning about students wanting to meet<br>face to face and have had enough of<br>doing zone you know so I do think<br>neither even for us introverts is that<br>there's a tipping point at which we're<br>like okay yeah<br>do you need other questions I was<br>curious<br>just in terms of methodology you know<br>was there a certain response what the<br>response rate was and how you know you<br>got such a high number of responses we<br>did we try we did use cultures that was<br>our kind of way of doing it but we yeah<br>I was I was a bit disappointed with the<br>response er and we've got 512 responses<br>across Wellington most of those we were<br>hoping to be able to get a significant<br>amount in each in each Center so hat<br>City you know wydad upper but we we<br>probably only got a significant amount<br>go enough in Wellington City we got a<br>lot of responses money to city do you<br>know so that you know that that's a yeah<br>we just did it online so we're only<br>going to get people who have internet<br>that was a little weakness no we were<br>kind of aware of there but we just in<br>terms of time we had to go for a online<br>version and we used neighborly<br>neighborly to advertise the survey we<br>use Facebook groups I tried to join up<br>advertised the survey yeah<br>so mostly neighborly and Facebook groups<br>yes other questions um question one<br>thing that we discovered in the lockdown<br>was the amazing amount of public spaces<br>in the carbon highbury Northland area<br>and public walks and yet of course we<br>we're now being trained that you stay at<br>least a meter away from people and don't<br>breathe on them do you think that's<br>going to have an impact on New<br>Zealanders use or desire for public<br>spaces the third spaces well I<br>I wonder even though we're being trained<br>to not breathe on people I think I think<br>the the bigger kind of compulsion that I<br>got a sense from just talking and<br>hearing but others speak about their<br>situations was was to use to be out and<br>using the public realm and I do think<br>having now discovered these new public<br>spaces that people I think we'll see a<br>lot more people using them and maybe<br>maybe it will will drop off over time<br>but I do think for a good while we will<br>see people making use of these new<br>places yeah yes because it's going to be<br>an interesting change New Zealanders<br>tend as you as you found and<br>demonstrated not to move about except in<br>large groups the pubs and the than the<br>nightclubs and the theatres and the<br>concerts and yet the local packs are<br>designed for small groups hmm yeah well<br>I think maybe the most maybe we just<br>noticed the big groups but actually<br>there's a whole lot of groups kind of<br>you know plotting around neighborhoods<br>and things and yeah I don't know I mean<br>you know we I walk up this path you know<br>a few times a week up to the top of my<br>dinghy<br>and there's at least L see at least you<br>know 10 to 20 people most days were many<br>more people than I used to see even<br>under kind of liberal level too so yeah<br>thank you<br>last question Vicki yeah okay thanks for<br>that there just one small question begin<br>with you have a list of the places that<br>they considered favor there's a yeah<br>yeah so it's just thinking like I mean<br>most of my stuff has to do with social<br>use of space and I tend to follow a kind<br>of a assemblage model which tends to<br>look at the singularity of each place<br>and it tends to not look at finding<br>generalized sets of things that you can<br>put down as so these are the things you<br>should have or whatever and so but I<br>just listening just you describing some<br>of the characteristics that people gave<br>as to why they went there I was thinking<br>that'd be really great to do to<br>crossover between the two sort of<br>methods and they to me there's a lot of<br>valuable stuff in there so yeah I know<br>so I just thought I'd say that just<br>because yeah yeah no differently I mean<br>at one stage we were thinking should we<br>should we almost be getting them to kind<br>of geo locate their you know their their<br>space honor their favorite place or<br>whatever on a map but you could do that<br>haven't they already identified it<br>somehow have been named didn't file it<br>with words so you know but you could<br>work out what you can work out where it<br>was I think mostly and we haven't<br>haven't looked at that indeed I've had a<br>quick skim I think I could mostly work<br>out where it is and some people have<br>talked in general terms but yeah we did<br>once we had a we did a whole of quite<br>ad-hoc surveys of all sorts of people<br>both everyday people and people in<br>organizations you know across Melbourne<br>and asked him about what was the most<br>publicly sinabi in place that they found<br>it wasn't new favorite place and they<br>said they were making assessments of<br>what they thought was the most important<br>place for the community around and then<br>we were trying then we would help get<br>those and then accounts trying to<br>account for them in a kind of fairly<br>casual way but I found a really really<br>valuable thing to do to actually see<br>what specifically was to place and then<br>go back to see why<br>yeah well when the internet wasn't just<br>one factor it was like and it was<br>interacting factors that what the other<br>thing that we are planning to do is that<br>we so a lot of people would identify so<br>for example one person seed Vincent's at<br>space I think on
