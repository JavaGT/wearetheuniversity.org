back today I am here<br>with James macaws from Tohru Tech who's<br>gonna tell us a little bit about himself<br>and his work experiences I mean he's got<br>some advice for our upcoming graduates<br>as well<br>so James if you could just tell us a<br>little bit about yourself and your<br>company and what you do um well thanks<br>Kandra I am a software engineering<br>graduate from the University of Waikato<br>and I've I'm pretty much worked like<br>then Hamilton for most of my career<br>apart from a couple years over in the UK<br>but um yeah I've got a lot of experience<br>and engineer things tracking and that<br>kind of stuff and in 2017 me and a<br>couple of other graduates to market<br>image you know watch at University<br>engineering department started our own<br>company called politic um so our first<br>product there was support that we<br>created called The Guardian basically<br>it's a it's a financial a facial<br>recognition system we used to help help<br>problem gamblers exclude themselves from<br>venues and prevent relapses where they<br>basically they they want to be excluded<br>from a venue but they they can't resist<br>the temptation and come back in to<br>gamble so how it works is there's<br>already existing legislation that allows<br>a problem gambler to issue herself<br>exclusion order and these orders are<br>done through a healthcare provider so<br>previously we we saw the opportunity was<br>that there was an existing paper-based<br>system and that's where the the game<br>gaming venue like a public club with<br>pokies Rock Casino would get sent<br>through a paper a photo or a photo of<br>someone with some details and basically<br>they just got pinned up on a board at<br>the back of the venue we're the staff<br>heads remember these faces and then and<br>then as people came in if they were the<br>same people on that board they were then<br>asked to leave obviously when you've got<br>60 faces stuck on a board it's a bit<br>tricky to try and remember that<br>especially when you probably have a lot<br>of half yeah we've got a lot of seasonal<br>workers it can be pretty pretty hard so<br>wrong it also limits the number of<br>venues opposed to be excluded from so if<br>you think of a place like has been where<br>there might be sort of eight or nine<br>different venues if you can only be<br>excluded from one or two because that's<br>physically how many people someone can<br>remember it doesn't work very well so<br>what we can afford was a product that<br>would allow healthcare providers and the<br>Ministry of Health currently looks after<br>that or owns a database that we use for<br>this to make sure there's no privacy<br>issues and we restore these people in a<br>secure database and then have a facial<br>recognition system that checks people<br>get that database and then identify as<br>if that Putin's problem gambler if they<br>are a staff discretely just ask for some<br>ID and then suggest they probably<br>shouldn't be there and and those those<br>incidents recorded and it's had a very<br>good effect we've got a lot of buy-in<br>from the healthcare providers themselves<br>and across the industry and so we<br>started off in just pubs and clubs but<br>now across five casinos in New Zealand<br>in Australia as well and we also do a<br>bunch of other things like engineer<br>things based products optimization<br>justic solar energy monitoring we we try<br>and keep our and<br>definitely a keeper cross a few<br>different vehicles just so that if<br>something like covert hip and and all<br>pubs and clubs happen to shut for<br>instance then you've still got some<br>backup revenue coming in from other<br>places so what skills have you had to<br>pick up from with working from home and<br>kind of what challenges have you faced<br>with that as well um to be honest<br>probably hasn't been as much of a steep<br>change as you think we've obviously all<br>been working from home but as an IT<br>company the the biggest change is just<br>not being in the office near other<br>people I mean personally my biggest<br>challenge was been school and a kids<br>were shut surveillance in childcare and<br>WIC was definitely tough but now it<br>schools back ended I actually can't tell<br>you how much easier life is it's almost<br>feels like a bit of a holiday um<br>there definitely our challenges such as<br>the biggest one for me is probably the<br>impromptu the ones who wouldn't think<br>about like the impromptu chats with<br>colleagues and just be able to sit next<br>and whip through something and<br>technology obviously helps we use select<br>for messaging and we use teams of VoIP<br>calls meeting screen sharing but it's<br>still not quite the same is actually<br>physically being there talking to<br>someone especially when and when some of<br>your staff working areas of poor<br>internet and cellular coverage so we try<br>to pair this to um to measure around<br>there though<br>um if if I took one behavior I think is<br>most important for dealing the right<br>work it's probably ensuring that we<br>communicate readily with teammates and<br>this applies for on-site work as well<br>but when you're off-site it's almost out<br>of sight out of mind it's easier to<br>overlook people that might be sort of<br>sitting there silently stroking with<br>something that they could be easily<br>helped with we're not having those<br>random chats around the office and um<br>even if it's just a lot just social<br>chats being able to catch other people<br>really so year the key thing for me has<br>been making sure that we stay we all<br>talking to each other we're<br>communicating we just we're all open and<br>the information flowing between everyone<br>cool and do you find that it's been<br>working pretty well for your team yeah I<br>think so I think the team's been been<br>performing really well so I've been<br>really really pleased with how<br>everyone's doing quite proud of the team<br>how they've how they've handled this the<br>situation so James what would your top<br>three tips be for a friend new graduate<br>who's been interviewed in this post<br>covered world um I think the key thing<br>for me is to be yourself so your<br>interviewers aren't necessarily looking<br>for someone who's just the absolute<br>smartest or knows the most about<br>technology what they want is more of a<br>package so your CV sort of tells what<br>you've been working on but the interview<br>is more want to see how was this person<br>gonna fit in as part of a team the<br>interviewers will usually be looking for<br>someone who's confident and comfortable<br>talking about themselves but there<br>doesn't mean that if you're an introvert<br>you need to suddenly become an extrovert<br>because they're the interviewers kind of<br>be able to tell if you're if you're sort<br>of put on a bait persona basically the<br>interviewers want to get a feel for how<br>you interact with other team members and<br>clients and it's unlikely that they're<br>people and if you are going to try and<br>break you will make you feel bad about<br>yourself because that's just what a nice<br>things are - I'm feeling nervous isn't<br>as natural but trying to think of this<br>as an opportunity to demonstrate<br>knowledge and why you'd make a green<br>great teaming but rather than I'm just<br>going to go in there I'm going to be<br>embarrassed or I'm gonna I'm gonna feel<br>bad and if you seem comfortable your<br>interviewers are more likely to think<br>that your debt wealth situations the<br>workplace throws throws it use just<br>almost think of it like you want to be<br>prepared so don't coming to bars a but<br>at the same time<br>think of it as more of a chat amongst<br>potential colleagues rather than these<br>good cop/bad talk kind of kind of<br>scenario the other thing I'd say in this<br>helps with the first one as well as<br>prepare they are going interviews will<br>usually last at least an hour and they<br>will usually be multiple of them so<br>before you go and you even if you've<br>been told so non-technical make sure<br>you've brushed up on your technical<br>knowledge if the interviewer asks you<br>about common in industry concepts like<br>say continuous integration dependency<br>injection or whatever even if you<br>haven't used them the interview will go<br>a lot better for you if you at least<br>know what they're talking about and this<br>also applies just that company but<br>you're a having interview um if you go<br>and be knowing what thousand what they<br>sell the gun over will be a lot more<br>increased and press with you is if you<br>go on in you just have no idea what what<br>anything idea of anything about the<br>company um you should be able to find<br>all us in line but if you can't try best<br>I've gone for interviews with companies<br>where there they literally have no<br>online presence you sort of some just<br>gotta try and guess what they do but but<br>at least you can sort of see that<br>they've that they'll usually understand<br>it as well<br>you should also come prepared with a<br>list of questions for the interviewer<br>and things like what tools I use other<br>developers work together what kind of<br>work they have in mind for you what kind<br>of support professional development will<br>be available for you it just shows that<br>you've got you've got something you're<br>thinking about and how you're going to<br>fit any weather center with this<br>workplace if I've asked you have any<br>questions for us and you say ah no it<br>sort of shows that you haven't really<br>thought about things too much so I<br>definitely make sure you go in there<br>knowing what you're going to talk about<br>and being very confident in your ability<br>to be able to answer the questions that<br>they throw at you and the food thing is<br>be cool and what I mean by this is<br>you'll occasionally get trying to curve<br>for an interview and you just need to<br>deal with it like any other question for<br>example and this is this is something I<br>hope the mayor like you've you've you've<br>prepared for the interview you're<br>quietly confident everything's going<br>well then the interview or throw is a<br>random question that you like how many<br>picture of stations do you think<br>in New Zealand or what's 57 times 63 and<br>these these questions are designed see<br>how you deal with an unexpected<br>situation I don't use them personally<br>because it just feels about we had but<br>one place I was employed at and it was a<br>really great workplace because some<br>people I've heard some developer say off<br>if a would place ask me those questions<br>I don't connected with myself I would<br>want to work out but it was a really<br>good workplace um and the whole point of<br>them when I was talking to the guy asked<br>me them later was to see how you deal<br>with something unexpected in order to<br>see how you think often the interviewer<br>is not after a precise answer like 57<br>times 63 they want you to know and the<br>company that asked this was actually a<br>young financial company they want you to<br>know that 57 times 63 is about 3,600<br>they've had people that say oh it's 36<br>all they've had people say are 10,000<br>and they're just throwing out while<br>geezers were not so of thinking<br>logically about it when you're dealing<br>with financial services provider and<br>you're dealing with money getting a<br>number wrong and not recognizing that it<br>might be out but it is obviously quite a<br>bad thing so um basically if the<br>interviewer asks you a random question a<br>even one that's just a normal technical<br>question you just have no idea I'll try<br>and think of through logically and don't<br>try and be ask them because that won't<br>get you very aligned but just try and if<br>possible try and talk through your<br>thought process and how you're attacking<br>the problem as long as you don't panic<br>and think carefully logically through<br>the problem you'll probably be okay so<br>the UNAM James Watts 57 times 63 it's<br>3,500 mining one Wow Wow<br>yeah I wouldn't be able to us I only do<br>that because I remember it now for the<br>record I did get that right and I did<br>get the job nice good work those are<br>really awesome tips and I completely<br>agree with you particularly around the<br>one having prepared with questions I<br>always like to ask what the employer is<br>looking for because you know you might<br>know if the bet that<br>said I want a person who can work 70<br>hours a week and you're sitting there<br>going I'm gonna work 37 how important do<br>you think that networking internally and<br>externally just on the relationship side<br>of the business before and during covert<br>and obviously moving forward yeah how<br>important are these things so they're<br>just as important as they were before<br>the pandemic I mean networking is pretty<br>critical any business or and and you can<br>almost think of yourself as a business<br>as well if you're if you're putting<br>yourself out trying to sell your skills<br>to to a company to employ you you're<br>representing you're representing<br>yourself<br>so it's maintain giving relationships<br>with people maintaining relationships<br>that people are really important it's<br>it's a little bit harder during a<br>pandemic when it's harder to maintain<br>when you're trying to maintain these<br>relationships and you can't meet face to<br>face but that just meant you need to put<br>a bit more effort in um for for our<br>business is especially important for<br>social activities because you want to<br>maintain a bit of a culture in your in<br>your company and one thing that we we<br>did before the pandemic is every Friday<br>the whole team goes out for an outing on<br>Friday we there's a coffee or drink<br>shaft and we just have a basic team<br>meeting catch up and just get the office<br>and that's pretty easy we know we need<br>to do it just pop down the road to a<br>different cafe but when everyone's<br>locked inside the house you get a bit<br>more creative so I'm what we ended up<br>doing is just every Friday afternoon we<br>we all got together or teams as it were<br>and yeah have a bit of a chance see how<br>people are doing one of the guys puts up<br>a list of non-work-related questions<br>about what was the first level to<br>activity that you did and what's the<br>thing he must most from lockdown and and<br>here just have a bit of a social chat<br>and then after that we um we sometimes<br>play a few were there like online games<br>like dunno if you do the scribbler it's<br>when we've sort of got to draw something<br>and everyone else has got a gear drawing<br>so you're just just a bit of a way of<br>getting everyone around having a bit of<br>a laugh and just maintain it social<br>diction and with external suppliers it's<br>the same but you need to maintain those<br>relationships with your clients<br>suppliers and it's just in the end it's<br>a lot about just picking up the phone<br>and having a chat to them because often<br>for us a lot of our external external<br>partners are in a different city anyway<br>so so it hasn't changed the huge amount<br>that's just that you've got to go to a<br>bit more effort to maintain those those<br>networks that's awesome and those are my<br>questions but I guess last one if<br>there's anything that you want to say to<br>our grads or the students coming through<br>the programs and yeah any advice you've<br>got to share or anything like that it<br>does come back<br>so those so actually actually here's<br>probably the most the most good advice I<br>can give you when I first came out of<br>university I was fortunate enough to be<br>going through the engineering program<br>and I speaking of networks knew someone<br>who is my current business partner who<br>got me a job somewhere else so I never<br>had to sort of interview or anything for<br>for a job but when I lift that job<br>couple years later and wind over to the<br>UK I arrived there at the beginning of<br>2009 which is not too long after the GFC<br>and it was about three months after all<br>the banks there had laid off about 30<br>percent of the IT staff so that means<br>the job market was pretty saturated with<br>IT workers and there weren't a huge<br>amount of jobs so um I basically after<br>after turning on Europe for the wall to<br>house in the my CV I must have send out<br>hundreds of CVS and never heard a<br>response and as an employer now I can<br>see why because you received so many TVs<br>you can't personally respond to each one<br>and this you're actually thinking about<br>hiring them the thing I would advise is<br>don't keep us at and keep trying because<br>you will get a job eventually and it<br>doesn't necessarily mean that your it<br>doesn't issue go to the episodes mattes<br>the PhD students where a lot of it is<br>just how you'll fit in ensuring that<br>you'll work well in a team and also<br>being a bit passionate about<br>passionate about what you do and yes a I<br>spent two months in the artsy beads I<br>mean she got two job interviews after an<br>on the phone interview about C++ which<br>was probably the worst interview of my<br>life which I'd where I didn't know half<br>the questions but yeah they'd actually<br>been looking for about two or three<br>months and they interviewed some pretty<br>good candidates but the thing that got<br>me in there was that they felt that I<br>would be a good addition to the team<br>that I had vated so they you know joke<br>around a bit of an interview and show<br>that you've got a bit of personality and<br>that was that was it so yeah my advice<br>we have been here before this isn't this<br>isn't a new thing he'll always be as ups<br>and downs in economy so just keep trying<br>don't don't the key hit down and you'll<br>be all right awesome there's a really<br>good advice in an awesome story as well<br>definitely yeah it makes you appreciate<br>the probably the path that some people<br>have got I mean the hard work that you<br>do have to take as well sometimes to<br>really learn that job so well done it's<br>obviously set you up pretty well for<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
