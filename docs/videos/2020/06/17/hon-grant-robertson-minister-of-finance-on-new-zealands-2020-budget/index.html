Our business school prides<br>ourselves on being at the centre of the<br>in the Nexus of innovation here in New<br>Zealand we have technology we have<br>government policy we have private sector<br>professional services and it is this<br>opportunity to bring together both the<br>economic consideration as well as policy<br>and civic society that we think makes us<br>unique. And for those purposes it is a<br>great pleasure for me to actually have<br>with us the Honorable Grant Robertson<br>who is the Minister of Finance for New<br>Zealand to speak with us today about the<br>2020 budget. The budget which I believe<br>has been named Rebuilding Together.<br>Minister Robertson will<br>have about 15 minutes to talk about the<br>budget. But what is really nice is we've<br>asked high school students from around<br>the country to submit questions about<br>the budget that we will present to the<br>Minister for his response. I should say<br>up front thank you very much to all the<br>high school students and all the high<br>schools who responded. We received some<br>very thoughtful and some very insightful<br>questions, some tough ones as well for<br>the Minister. So I really appreciate you<br>taking the time to participate in this<br>activity. But without further ado I'll<br>pass it over to the Minister. Well kia ora<br>tena koe Ian, Ngā mihi nui kia koutou katoa. Greetings to all of you wherever you are<br>when you see this broadcast and<br>conversation. It's actually a real<br>highlight for me of the year to come and<br>be a part of this event and to have<br>questions, particularly from high school<br>students, about the budget. I always find<br>that the questions I get in this<br>particular format are some of the<br>toughest that get asked and so I really<br>look forward to answering those<br>questions in a few minutes time. Everybody will be aware that Budget 2020<br>was put together in the shadow of COVID-19. COVID-19 is not only the most<br>significant health crisis that the<br>planet has faced for many many decades<br>it's also a 1 in 100 year economic shock. And so putting a budget together in<br>those circumstances was enormously<br>challenging. As most people would imagine<br>or would know the budget process<br>actually starts many months before it's<br>delivered around May of each year<br>and obviously we had done that process<br>in 2019 we had begun to create the<br>budget from about September or October<br>2019 for delivery in May 2020.<br>When COVID-19 came along we were very<br>well advanced and in fact we'd virtually<br>completed our budget work and we had to<br>take a moment to stop, as I think most<br>businesses had to do around New Zealand,<br>and say what needs to change here and so<br>the budget that I ended up delivering on<br>the 14th of May was very different from<br>the one that we had intended to deliver.<br>It was different in a couple of specific<br>ways, one was the quantum of spending in<br>it which obviously was significantly<br>higher than we had planned but<br>proportionate to a 1 in 100 year<br>economic shock. Secondly was the whole<br>way in which we had to deliver it and<br>it's worth noting that putting together<br>a budget under a level four lockdown was<br>very challenging for the officials at<br>The Treasury who did a remarkable job. But it also meant that some of the<br>things that normally happened with the<br>preparation of a budget had to be put to<br>one side. So, for example, the Government<br>usually agrees its budget package about<br>six weeks before delivery and what<br>happens between that date and the date<br>of delivery of the budget is what's<br>called the budget moratorium when no new<br>spending is allowed to be approved.<br>Clearly, we had to put that to one side<br>this year as we responded to COVID-19. So the context of that was by the time<br>we got to Budget<br>2020 we had already put aside a<br>significant amount of resources for<br>responding to COVID-19. That began with<br>our 12 billion dollar package on the<br>17th of March which lifted main benefits,<br>doubled the winter energy payment, and<br>put in place the first incarnation of<br>the now very well known wage subsidy<br>scheme that has paid out about 11<br>billion dollars to support 1.6 million<br>New Zealanders to stay and work through<br>the COVID-19 lockdown period. So we went<br>into the Budget with that and then<br>additional support across everything<br>from keeping our aviation sector going<br>through to additional supports for<br>low-income New Zealanders,<br>to changes to our tax system to support<br>our business community all of which lead<br>to around about another 13 billion or so<br>dollars already being spent before we<br>even got to Budget Day, so it was a very<br>unusual situation. The plan that we laid<br>out on Budget Day has three parts to it:<br>respond, recover, and rebuild and those<br>three phases are not distinct phases<br>they overlap one another but they do<br>give you a guide to the plan that we<br>have as a Government to be able to get<br>on top of COVID-19 and then come out<br>the other side even stronger. The<br>response phase of our plan you've seen<br>that involved bolstering our health<br>system up so that we were ready for<br>COVID-19 and significant resources go<br>into the budget again in addition to<br>what we've already put in place there.<br>and the cushioning of that economic blow<br>and the wage subsidy scheme was the core<br>of that. And it's hard the wage subsidy<br>scheme is about making sure that people<br>stay connected to their employment<br>because one of the lessons we've learned<br>from previous economic crises and<br>recessions is that the scaring effect<br>of unemployment is significant so we<br>wanted to do everything we can to give<br>breathing space to companies and<br>employees, not to make precipitous<br>decisions based out of fear of what<br>might happen but give 12 weeks to be<br>able to be more sure of what the<br>environment would be and as it happens<br>that 12 weeks ends today the day that<br>we're filming this. We have agreed, and we<br>did agree in the budget, to an extension<br>to the wage subsidy scheme but with much<br>more targeted and tighter criteria and<br>this is very much for businesses, for<br>example in the hospitality tourism or<br>retail sectors, who weren't able to trade<br>at all under level 4 or level 3 and in<br>many cases have very limited ability to<br>generate revenue even under level 2 or<br>now as we go into level 1. So we have an<br>eight week extension as part of our<br>response phase but the main focus of the<br>budget is on the recovery and rebuilding<br>phases for New Zealand and critically<br>that's about jobs, it's about the<br>retention of people in employment but<br>also the creation of new jobs in a<br>number of sectors where we think we can<br>do that job as well as start to look<br>towards what a rebuild would look like.<br>So for example in the<br>construction sector we know that we want<br>more houses to be built in New Zealand.<br>We know that that sector is a job rich<br>sector. We also know that the lack of<br>housing has been a real drain on our<br>productivity in our society in the long<br>term. So in the budget we put aside<br>funding to support the building of 8,000<br>new public housing places. In addition a<br>critical part of our package has been a<br>1.6 billion dollar package for training<br>and skills development. Now this is going<br>to mean that apprenticeships across the<br>board are now free, that means we're<br>going to get more people into some key<br>sectors like construction and others<br>where we know we're going to need a<br>workforce coming out the other end of<br>this. And this is a lesson learned from<br>the global financial crisis. At that time<br>one of the first things that happened<br>was that people laid off apprentices and<br>that meant that when the recovery came<br>along we didn't have the skilled<br>workforce that we needed. We're not<br>prepared to let that happen again<br>and that's why we're also going to be<br>supporting businesses to keep their<br>apprentices on during this period where<br>there may be some slowdown for them. That<br>whole package of training and education<br>is absolutely vital and that's the<br>biggest investment in that area we've<br>ever seen. At the same time there's<br>opportunities for job creation in<br>things like our environment and<br>conservation sectors. We've put a billion<br>dollar package aside to deal with<br>issues like pest management, the fencing<br>of waterways to stop pollution and<br>runoff into our rivers and lakes and<br>streams, the development of our DOC<br>estate in terms of the huts and tracks.<br>That's job creation in the immediate<br>term to support people who may have<br>found themselves out of work<br>as a result of COVID-19. And then we've<br>got sector specific packages, for<br>example for tourism. We know that this is<br>a sector that's been hugely affected.<br>Closing our borders was one of the main<br>things that has allowed us to get on top<br>of COVID-19, but it has a massive<br>spillover effect into the economy and so<br>that four hundred million dollar initial<br>package to support our tourism sector to<br>re orientate businesses, to be able in<br>some cases to put businesses into<br>hibernation, is a really important<br>part of dealing with that. And we have<br>those same sector packages looking at<br>areas like horticulture and agriculture, supporting specific communities<br>such as our Maori and Pasifica communities who<br>have been and will be more affected by<br>the economic impact, and in areas that<br>you might not think of as economic but<br>actually are significant job generators,<br>the arts and in sports, where those are<br>really important for the way our<br>communities come together but they also<br>do generate a lot of jobs. Alongside that<br>the Budget has a significant part of the<br>recovery package aimed towards our<br>social infrastructure. We have seen a lot<br>of communities really affected by this<br>and so there is funding for programs<br>like food in schools, significant<br>support to NGOs who provide family<br>violence services, and other services in<br>our community building on what we're<br>done already in terms of the income<br>support part of our package. And all of<br>that leads to the third phase of our<br>plan which is the reset and the rebuild.<br>This is an opportunity which doesn't<br>come along very often in life to be able<br>to stop and say is what we're doing<br>working and what what were issues that<br>we had not got on top of properly. Our<br>economic plan is focused around<br>improving productivity, improving<br>sustainability, and improving inclusion<br>in our economy and each of those gets a<br>boost through this budget as well. This<br>is a once-in-a-generation budget, the<br>amounts of money involved are<br>extraordinary, but if you save for a<br>rainy day you need to put the umbrella<br>up when it's required and that's what<br>we've done here. So New Zealand entered<br>into this crisis in a very strong fiscal<br>position. Our level of debt compared to<br>the rest of the world was extremely low<br>we came in at just under 20 percent of<br>GDP,<br>whereas if you compare to a country like<br>the United Kingdom they had 80 percent<br>or the US 90 percent. So yes, it does<br>mean we are going to be seeing an<br>extended period of deficits and of<br>increased debt, but New Zealand can<br>afford to do this. It's also very cheap<br>for New Zealand to be able to borrow at the<br>moment. Our cost of borrowing on that<br>extra money is actually very much<br>equivalent to previous costs as a<br>percentage of GDP even though we're<br>borrowing a lot more because interest<br>rates are very low at the moment. So at<br>the end of this we will have higher levels<br>of debt but they will still be among the<br>lowest in the OECD and that means that<br>as our economy grows we will be able to<br>reduce that debt but the philosophy that<br>I took into this was<br>I would rather protect the generations<br>of today, the young people of today, from<br>growing up in a house where perhaps their<br>parents don't have jobs or they don't<br>have sufficient income.<br>I'd rather protect those young people from<br>the scarring effect of that and then all<br>work together to reduce that debt in<br>the future, rather than try and come up<br>with some magic percentage number for<br>debt right now when we know that New<br>Zealand can afford to do this and<br>protect our people at the same time.<br>Final thing I'd like to say is that<br>Budget 2020 is different in another way<br>and that's that it's not the end of the<br>road. We have put aside a fifty billion<br>dollar fund for our response and<br>recovery and 20 billion or so of that<br>remains unspent. That's important because<br>the full story of COVID-19 has not yet<br>been told, the economic impacts across<br>the globe are enormous.<br>While here in New Zealand we can be<br>very satisfied and proud with the work<br>of the team of five million and getting<br>on top of the virus, infections grow<br>daily around the world. This virus will<br>be with our planet for several years to<br>come and will have a strong<br>economic impact on New Zealand but we're<br>well-placed to get through that we're<br>well-placed as a country to be able to<br>take the spirit of coming together, he waka eke noa—we are all in this together,<br>take that spirit from our health<br>response and add it into our economic<br>recovery as well. My final word is this,<br>one of the lessons we've learned is the<br>importance of supporting our own<br>communities through this. So if you do<br>get the opportunity to buy New Zealand<br>made, to experience New Zealand, to get<br>out and support New Zealand businesses,<br>artists, sporting events please do so<br>because that's the one thing we can all<br>do right now to make sure our recovery<br>and rebuild goes well. So I look forward<br>to answering your questions and I look<br>forward to working with all of you as<br>part of our team of five million on<br>our recovery and rebuild.<br>Thank you very much Minister for<br>providing us with an excellent overview<br>of the 2020  Budget. So I have some<br>questions that we've received from high<br>school students across the country.<br>I'll kind of break them into a few<br>themes. You mentioned in your overview<br>this issue of debt, and that was<br>certainly one of the questions that we<br>received quite a few responses about. So,<br>Luke from Roxbury Area High School asked<br>what impact do you think the budget will<br>have on government<br>debt repayments in ten years, when he's<br>26? And similarly, St. Mary's College had<br>a question that says how do you propose<br>to address the burden, or perhaps even<br>unfair burden, on young people of<br>the requirements to eventually pay back<br>the massive debt that has been incurred?<br>Yeah, look that was a common question question from everyone<br>I want to give a shout-out to my old school Kings High School<br>where I know that, I think it was<br>Sam from Kings also asked the same<br>question as well. So, I can understand why<br>this is a really important and big<br>question for people because these kinds<br>of levels of debt we have not seen in<br>New Zealand for many years. The last time<br>our level of net core crown credit reached<br>this was in the early 1990s. The good<br>news for New Zealanders: our economy is<br>much stronger now than it was then, and<br>secondly the cost of borrowing is<br>actually much lower than it was back in<br>the 90s. So in a sense for the Government<br>the immediate issue when it comes to<br>debt is interest rates, can we afford to<br>do this? We have historically<br>low interest rates and a projection from<br>most economists that they will stay low<br>for a long period of time.<br>So the reassurance I can give people is that<br>the borrowing is affordable and the<br>economy is strong coming into this. In<br>terms of how we go with repaying debt,<br>when you look at the budget documents in<br>the forecast period, yes the four-year<br>forecast period debt peaks up at around 53<br>percent of GDP. It then starts to come<br>down as the economy grows, and it's<br>really important that we get a focus on<br>saying if we can get the economy back<br>humming and growing again then that<br>level of debt will come down. Obviously<br>we also have to be very careful with our<br>spending from here on out, and a large<br>bulk of the spending that we're doing is<br>actually temporary because it's there<br>and it's designed to get people through this<br>But obviously the careful fiscal<br>management that my government's shown<br>and previous governments have shown will<br>have to continue in order to make sure<br>that that debt burden reduces over time.<br>But as I said in my introductory<br>comments, I look at it that the future<br>generations are actually the ones who<br>need support now as well, and if we<br>regard ourselves as all being in this<br>together to resolve this, I think that's<br>better. I think it's a real mistake to<br>set generations against one another on this, and I did<br>notice in some of the questions that<br>came through, this question of well what<br>should we do about the superannuation<br>age? I just think that's not the answer<br>for us at this time. I mean government's<br>over time may well need to address that<br>but right now we need to be supporting<br>people who are coming into retirement<br>because perhaps many of them may not<br>have been able to work in the last two<br>or three years of their working life<br>because we've got unemployment rising.<br>So, I'm not a fan of the intergenerational<br>thing, maybe it's because I'm Generation<br>X and I sit right in the middle, but I<br>think it's really<br>important that that debt repayment is<br>done over a period of time. But I will<br>say, New Zealand will have higher levels<br>of debt for a period of time than we've<br>been used to. But that's because we<br>haven't faced a one in one hundred-year shock before.<br>So one of the other issues<br>that came up in the questions was taxes.<br>One of the other aspects, in terms of how<br>we might repay the debt, and Wellington<br>East Girls College provided a question.<br>And assuming that you're still in<br>government when they enter the job<br>market in four to eight years' time, how<br>heavily can they expect to be taxed? Or<br>is there some assurance that a<br>contractory fiscal policy involving tax<br>increases will not be used? And there may<br>be more creative ways for the government<br>to raise funds.<br>Look, I mean these are questions that future governments are going to have to resolve<br>and I guess the thing I can assure the questioners is that I remain committed to a fair tax system.<br>New Zealand does have a<br>progressive tax system, and it is<br>important that, you know, people pay their<br>taxes in proportion to their income<br>and in proportion to what they can<br>afford. We also need to look at the<br>overall balance of our tax system. So<br>income taxes are only one part of a<br>taxation system. We had the Tax<br>Working Group look at that, and they've<br>provided us with some interesting<br>frameworks around things like<br>environmental taxes, for example, to be<br>able to support us as we go forward from here.<br>So there will be a mixture of<br>policy responses that come out the other<br>side of this. But, you know, New Zealand has a tax system which has<br>some real advantages, as well as some<br>gaps, and the real advantages are around<br>the fact that it's easy and simple<br>and clear to understand. And I think<br>that's one of the things that remains important to me, in terms of the principles.<br>Generally speaking, we set our taxes at a lower rate<br>than many other countries around the world.<br>And while it's important that they<br>remain proportionate to our need<br>those principles are important. Some of<br>the disadvantages are that we don't<br>capture all of the ways in which people<br>make money within our tax system<br>And so those are issues that will need to be<br>dealt with. But for those people<br>rest assured those core principles of<br>the tax system remain important.<br>Another big question we received from the<br>students was around unemployment<br>as you can appreciate. And Ella from Otago Girls High School sent in a question<br>which says, how does the current budget support young people to have good employment<br>opportunities in the future?<br>Yeah, and look, this is going to be probably the<br>number one issue in the economy for the<br>next year or two, at least.<br>The forecasts in the Budget saw unemployment peaking at just under 10 percent.<br>The good news is that even since the Budget,  most economists have brought that down a little bit.<br>NZIR, NZ Institute of Economic Research, said maybe around 8 percent.<br>Some of the banks are similarly<br>looking at that because we have<br>rebounded a bit more quickly than was<br>forecast. But even at 8 percent, that's a<br>doubling of the unemployment rate from<br>what we've seen.<br>So that's why there's such a big focus in the budget around apprenticeships, trade training, making<br>sure we give open access to the areas<br>where we know there are job<br>opportunities in the future. It's why<br>we're putting a lot of money and support<br>behind small businesses. I'm a believer<br>that as we come out of this and people<br>are looking for job opportunities, we<br>should take the philosophy of growing<br>our prosperity and our wealth from the<br>ground up. And that really does mean a<br>focus on, for example, supporting<br>small businesses to do e-commerce,<br>to have a digital offering. So that's an<br>opportunity there, potentially, for young<br>people as they come through this.<br>Obviously we've got existing programs<br>like fees free and the additional<br>student allowance support, and so on that<br>we gave to support people to train and<br>retrain. And then, as I say, there are the<br>sector-specific programs .Where we're<br>working through with anything from<br>tourism to agriculture and horticulture,<br>around how we can see good, high-wage<br>jobs being created in those sectors. So all of those things come together.<br>One thing I didn't have a<br>chance to talk about, there's so much in the Budget,<br>was around a concept we've<br>got called industry transformation plans.<br>And this is actually looking at areas<br>where we think there's real potential<br>for New Zealand to take a lead, and to be<br>able to create new jobs. So a couple of<br>A couple of those that people might be interested in are Agritech, agricultural technology.<br>So how we apply new technology to what we're already good at, in terms of the<br>production of agriculture. Digital<br>services, which is clearly an area<br>that a lot of people are interested in<br>getting themselves involved in today.<br>So we're going be developing those plans<br>over the next few years, so that we've<br>got a focus for young people to<br>say, well actually that's a career that I could go into.<br>So a big focus on that in<br>the Budget because we know the<br>Government's got to be an active player<br>in helping support the creation of jobs.<br>One of the other big themes that we saw<br>across the high school students<br>questions, was a real appreciation of the<br>importance of sustainability and the<br>environment. There were many<br>questions that sort of touched on<br>this issue around how does the<br>government plan to balance the economic<br>needs with continual investment in<br>sustainability?<br>Yeah, and look, for me we should never<br>allow ourselves to buy into a false<br>dichotomy here that somehow the economy and the environment are separated out.<br>They're not. They are two sides of the<br>same coin, and we've had that<br>philosophy throughout our time in<br>government. And what Covid-19 has done<br>is there's been this huge disruption, but it<br>doesn't change the really important<br>goals we have as a government. One of<br>which is the transition to a low-carbon economy.<br>Because for New Zealand, that<br>actually is the only way forward for<br>sustainability and prosperity at the<br>same time. So the budget continues us<br>down that path. If we look at some of<br>the areas we've been working on<br>renewable energy, where New Zealand<br>does really well with 90 percent of our<br>electricity from renewables. But we want<br>to push on from that.<br>But then what are the opportunities that come off that? And one area again where there's further<br>support in the Budget and in the<br>programs we've already got underway<br>is the development of a hydrogen economy. So because New Zealand produces so much of<br>its electricity renewably, we can then be<br>the home of<br>Green hydrogen. Now, we've already got<br>partnerships going with companies out of<br>Japan around the production of hydrogen<br>to fuel our transport fleet, and other<br>energy needs. That's the kind of<br>thing we've got to push on where there<br>is both an opportunity for prosperity,<br>but it supports our sustainability.<br>Other areas too. Our transport fleet. Industrial heat, the way in which our big<br>manufacturers provide energy. We're<br>working on that as well. So we must not<br>allow the disruption of Covid-19 to<br>somehow be used as an excuse to back off<br>those sustainability initiatives. And we<br>certainly aren't going to do that.<br>So the class of 2020, the graduating class of 2020, is going to be entering into an<br>environment that, well, we haven't seen if<br>not ever, certainly in quite a long time.<br>And I'm certain that they're<br>excited because they're getting out of<br>high school, but they're also quite<br>nervous because they're entering into an<br>environment where their parents probably<br>don't have good advice for them.<br>Their parents never had to deal with this.<br>I'd be curious maybe if you had some<br>last words around what you would tell<br>those students who are about to leave.<br>That, you know, they're about to have this<br>great success and enter into this wild world.<br>What advice would you have for<br>them?<br>It is unprecedented, and the government just as much as individuals is facing unknown territory.<br>I think what we're trying to do is go<br>back to some really core principles here<br>which is, you know, we are all in this<br>together and that as a government we<br>know that we've got a role to support<br>people when times are tough.<br>But also provide opportunities for people. And so I guess my piece of advice would be to stay optimistic.<br>New Zealand had a robust<br>economy going into this, we were doing<br>well. Unemployment was low, wages were<br>going up. We will come out of this well too.<br>It's just going to take a bit of time<br>and a bit of effort from all of us to<br>work together and do that. That<br>would be my main piece of advice<br>retain your optimism. You might<br>have to delay your overseas experience<br>if you were thinking of doing a gap<br>year, or something like that.<br>Could just pick a different island.<br>Exactly, so do your gap here in the South Island...<br>But yeah, you know there are going to be some changes that people are  going to face.<br>But I think, you know, this has been a really<br>tough time and it isn't over.<br>The rest of the world is really still struggling<br>with new infections, and that means our<br>border restrictions will stay in place.<br>Hopefully with the exception of a couple<br>of bubbles with our Australian and<br>Pacific neighbors. But things are<br>going to be different, and change is<br>always hard to deal with. But stay<br>optimistic and stay entrepreneurial as well.<br>I do really believe the<br>opportunity to grow prosperity from<br>the ground up. For people to be their<br>own bosses in the future remains an<br>important part of what we do. So yeah,<br>we're here to help, we're here to support<br>and I think if we all take on that<br>spirit of uniting as a country for a<br>recovery we'll do well.<br>Minister, personally I just like to thank<br>you and your team for all the hard work<br>you've done for our country over the<br>last several months. Certainly it has been<br>unprecedented, but I think we can all be<br>quite proud of how New Zealand has<br>pulled through, and certainly that<br>doesn't happen without excellent<br>leadership. So, thank you very much and on<br>behalf of the Wellington School of Business and Government, thank you very<br>much taking the time to come join us<br>today. I do hope that the various<br>audiences around the country that had an<br>opportunity to view this<br>gain some great insight from how we as a country <br>have attempted to deal with this<br>unprecedented event, and I'm certain that<br>many around the world<br>for many generations, will be studying New<br>Zealand's response because of some of<br>the many innovations that we've<br>implemented. Thank you very much for the<br>day and thank you very much Minister.<br>Thanks Ian.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
