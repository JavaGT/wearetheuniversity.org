help you very much so I'm going<br>to give you a very quick March through<br>sustainable development and a bit of<br>climate change thrown in for good luck<br>this is a whole lecture course normally<br>so I've absorbed into about 45 minutes<br>so it's going to be a bit a bit brief<br>and it a bit skating over the top but<br>hopefully you'll get something out of it<br>so I'm going to start off with a little<br>video clip and this video clip only runs<br>for about 10 seconds so I'll run it a<br>few times the first thing climate change<br>isn't the same sustainable development<br>so I'm going to say a little bit about<br>climate change first because it's one of<br>the Canaries in the coal mine that<br>alerted us to the fact that the world<br>needed to step up to create a<br>sustainable future there and the<br>question about climate change people<br>always ask this has the climate changed<br>well this little video just shows the<br>temperature of the earth from 1950<br>through to 2010 and it pulses in and out<br>as you get hot years in cold years and<br>but if it goes redder then it's getting<br>hotter if it goes bluer then it's<br>getting colder and so I think I'll let<br>you make your own mind up as to what's<br>happened over that time and of course<br>since 2010 over the last three years in<br>particular we've seen every year has<br>been successively the warmest year ever<br>recorded so I think it's fairly clear<br>that the world has been warming climate<br>change and sustainable development are<br>not new so the greenhouse effect was<br>outlined by Fourier in 1827 so it's been<br>around for a while most people think<br>it's only happened since the earth 17<br>1990 but it's actually been around a<br>while and john tyndall was the first one<br>to demonstrate experimentally how carbon<br>dioxide absorbs the radiation at the<br>wavelength at which it goes out of the<br>of the earth and it's get absorbed by<br>these so-called greenhouse gases in the<br>atmosphere and more of those gases that<br>there are in the atmosphere the more of<br>the outgoing heat gets absorbed and<br>hence we get global warming and most<br>first year physics students still repeat<br>that experiment pretty much using<br>apparatus which still looks very much<br>like that or at least in my case it did<br>and the physics hasn't changed since<br>1881 and then Spencer Iranian in 1896<br>was the first one to predict that this<br>trapping of the of these gases in the<br>atmosphere a doubling of carbon dioxide<br>will leave to about a 5 degree warming<br>and he didn't have any of the world's<br>you know these massive supercomputers<br>that we use today to model all of the<br>feedbacks between the ocean in the<br>atmosphere and the land and the sea ice<br>and the biosphere and so on he did it<br>all on a piece of paper and he got an<br>answer not too far distant from what we<br>still estimated to be today and in fact<br>we actually have his girlfriend to thank<br>for the fact that he did that<br>calculation because she dumped him and<br>he went into a sort of fit of depression<br>and locked himself away for several<br>years to do this calculation so so we've<br>got his girlfriend to thank for the fact<br>that she dumped him for doing this<br>calculation so what you really want to<br>know is what's going to happen in the<br>future and so this is a projection it's<br>time from the Hadley Centre in the UK<br>which is the UK government Research<br>Center into climate change and what you<br>can see is the year stepping forward<br>there in the bottom right hand corner<br>the temperature scale it along is along<br>the bottom of the earth is rotating<br>around and you'll see that it says<br>temperature rise for an a1 B scenario<br>what the hell does that mean so we don't<br>know what the temperature change is<br>going to be over the next hundred years<br>because it depends on how much of these<br>greenhouse gases we emit into the<br>atmosphere so in order to make these<br>projections we don't call them<br>predictions because we can't predict we<br>call them projections we project if the<br>world behaved like this then the climate<br>change would be like that so this is a<br>projection which is what we call a<br>medium-low scenario where the world<br>continues to emit some greenhouse gases<br>but at a rate not quite as high as it is<br>today and what you can see is that as it<br>goes round you get blue pulses and red<br>pulses this is this what we call<br>inter-annual variability that the<br>weather changes from day to day week to<br>week year to year but as we move further<br>forward you'll start to see particularly<br>up at the top near the top i've tilted<br>this down so that hopefully you can see<br>a little bit more about this part of the<br>world but you'll see in a particular in<br>the northern high latitudes there a<br>considerable warming start to take place<br>and that's because the large land masses<br>largely in the northern hemisphere the<br>landmass is warm up quicker than the<br>oceans because the oceans act as a huge<br>heat sink water is a very good absorber<br>of heat and so that tends to even out<br>the temperature and so as we get to the<br>middle of the century you can see all<br>the major land masses are starting to<br>warm up by the second and third half of<br>the century then even the oceans are<br>starting to turn a little bit sort of<br>orangey and start to warm up as well<br>they'll stay with the odd blue pulse<br>you'll see there so they'll still be<br>some Scot climate skeptic around and<br>2080 saying it was cold in the pool last<br>year so it can't possibly be go global<br>warming and then by the end of the<br>century as you can see pretty much the<br>everywhere is warm particularly those<br>land masses<br>that's about an average global warming<br>of about three and a half degrees which<br>is a kind of mid-range estimate of what<br>we might expect and I used to show a<br>high emission scenario where we<br>continued to emit a lot of greenhouse<br>gases but the whole sort of world went<br>black and people didn't like it it kind<br>of freaked them out a little bit so I<br>don't show that one anymore<br>so that's a little bit to show you that<br>we have something of an issue around<br>climate change but climate change that's<br>very abstract in its numbers if you like<br>and so what I've done here is I've sure<br>I showed this black line here shows the<br>temperature in northern Europe in 2000<br>in northern Europe and each point is a<br>year so that's 2003 why the arrows moved<br>I'm not quite sure<br>so that's 2003 what you can see is that<br>the summer in Europe in 2003 was<br>extraordinarily warm it's estimated that<br>over 40,000 people died as a result of<br>the heat wave in Europe that year and<br>that's a very very conservative estimate<br>and so we did the calculation and what<br>we've always said is I wonder how<br>unusual that that summer is so we ran<br>the climate models and of course we'd<br>already emitted some greenhouse gasses<br>by 2003 but let's assume that we hadn't<br>so let's assume back in back at the<br>beginning of the century back in 1900 he<br>would that summer have been and it came<br>out to be one in about a thousand years<br>so it was one in a thousand year summer<br>however we ran it again with the<br>greenhouse gases in and by 2003 already<br>that became a 1 in a 2<br>year summer so they were still really<br>unlucky to get it was still only one in<br>200 years but it was five times more<br>likely than it would have been if we<br>hadn't had global warming to that point<br>but then if you run the model out into<br>the future what you see is that by the<br>2040s that becomes an average summer and<br>by the 2060 s that becomes an unusually<br>cold summer so that that's that's just a<br>way of trying to express if you like<br>what what climate change is going to<br>feel like and the other one example I<br>like to use this biodiversity loss we're<br>in them we're losing species on the<br>planet today at a rate higher than any<br>other time in Earth's history and that<br>includes when the dinosaurs died out<br>we're in the middle of the sixth great<br>mass extinction of species right now and<br>there's a natural rate at which species<br>come into being and go out of existence<br>and that for mammals that's about one<br>species in a thousand every thousand<br>years and we're already is around about<br>a thousand types of that background<br>right that's not all due to climate<br>change that's due to invasive species<br>land degradation the fact that we've cut<br>down lots of forests and land over to<br>agriculture and as my biological<br>colleague put it we've killed everything<br>larger than the sheep but the prediction<br>is because of climate change that's<br>going to increase by a further factor of<br>ten to a factor of 10,000 times the<br>background rate of loss of species and<br>people have done have tried to do an<br>estimate of how many of the world's<br>species are going to we're going to lose<br>by the end of this century and it's an<br>extraordinarily difficult calculation to<br>do because we don't even know how many<br>species there are on the planet we don't<br>even have an inventory of all the<br>species we're finding new species all<br>the time so the estimates are a very<br>broad range but those estimates come to<br>coming the range of something like 25 to<br>40 percent so we're going to likely to<br>lose as a result of this about 25 to 40<br>percent of all the species on the planet<br>by the end of the century if we don't<br>deal with this so that's a that's an<br>entire lecture on climate change just to<br>give you an idea of what it feels like a<br>colleague put together this talk I've<br>shown this graph for many years so this<br>shows the observed temperature change<br>and then this shows the projected<br>temperature change if we don't mitigate<br>our greenhouse gas emissions in other<br>words if we don't move decarbonize our<br>economy and this is what we're trying to<br>achieve on global warming of no more<br>two degrees but to do that we have to<br>completely decarbonize by 2050 we have<br>to reduce to much lower than it is today<br>very very quickly but then what one of<br>my colleagues did where other cleverly I<br>thought was to put put on a cell phone<br>well I saw I put myself on it and this<br>is very scary because the first thing<br>you have to do is decide when you're<br>going to die so the temptation is to run<br>this line all the way out here somewhere<br>but what I've done that I've been very<br>good and being objective and I've put<br>the average life expectancy of someone<br>of my age in and so you can see that in<br>my lifetime I expect to see global<br>temperatures move from about here to<br>about here which you know which i think<br>is pretty bad but then I put my children<br>on it they were born in the late 1980s<br>and do their average life expectancy as<br>well and the change they can expect to<br>see in their lifetime is from here up to<br>about here which is you know an awful<br>lot more than I will see in my lifetime<br>and then what I did which is all that<br>which is very controversial is put my<br>grandchildren which are non-existent<br>grandchildren me my children are 30 and<br>32 so it's about time that we're getting<br>on with it frankly but I when I did this<br>slide I thought it's all right my<br>children are living back in the UK<br>they've both grown up and living in the<br>UK so they will never see this so that's<br>ok and then my daughter came out to live<br>in Australia for 18 months and saw me<br>give this presentation and I was in such<br>trouble when I got on but the point of<br>the exercise is that the climate change<br>that they could expect to see in their<br>lifetime is from here you know way up<br>here somewhere<br>so so that's what we're trying to avoid<br>so that's climate change in a nutshell<br>but if you thought climate change was<br>bad there are other strengths threats to<br>the planet and they are embodied in<br>threats what we call sustainable<br>development<br>is the story of how one species changed<br>a planet the latest chapter of our story<br>begins in England 250 years ago fuelled<br>by coal then oil several brilliant<br>inventions appeared they ignited the<br>Industrial Revolution which spread like<br>wildfire through Europe North America<br>Japan then elsewhere the great railways<br>then cars and highways connected people<br>across the globe medical discoveries<br>saved millions of lives new artificial<br>fertilizers meant we could feed more<br>people population rose rapidly but this<br>was nothing compared with what was to<br>come the 1950s marked the beginning of<br>the great acceleration globalization<br>marketing tourism and huge investments<br>helped fuel enormous growth people<br>swarmed to cities which became even more<br>powerful engines of creativity in a<br>single lifetime the well-being of<br>millions has improved beyond measure<br>health wealth security longevity never<br>have so many had so much yet 1 billion<br>are malnourished in a single lifetime we<br>have grown into a phenomenal global<br>force we move more sediment and rock<br>annually than all natural processes such<br>as erosion and rivers we manage<br>three-quarters of all land outside the<br>ice sheets greenhouse gas levels this<br>high have not been seen for over 1<br>million years<br>temperatures are increasing we have made<br>a hole in the ozone layer<br>we are losing biodiversity many of the<br>world's deltas of sinking due to damming<br>mining and other causes sea level is<br>rising ocean acidification is a real<br>threat we are altering Earth's natural<br>cycles we have entered the Anthropocene<br>a new geological epoch dominated by<br>humanity<br>this relentless pressure on our planet<br>risks unprecedented destabilization but<br>our creativity energy and industry offer<br>hope we have shaped our past we are<br>shaping our present we can shape our<br>future you and I a part of this story we<br>are the first generation to realize this<br>new responsibility as the population<br>grows to 9 billion we must find a safe<br>operating space for humanity for the<br>sake of future generations welcome to<br>so what that says is that as human<br>beings we are now affecting the world's<br>natural processes at a scale as large as<br>or larger than those natural processes<br>themselves and so that we are now the<br>dominant species on the planet so the<br>question then is how do we try and<br>create that safe operating space for<br>humanity that safe place on earth where<br>we can operate so the first thing to<br>look at is well how sustainable are we<br>now and I've picked out a few statistics<br>here to say how you know how is New<br>Zealand doing so the first thing is life<br>expectancy at birth and what you can see<br>is New Zealand is there for up from the<br>bottom but it's still doing pretty well<br>life expectancy of around about 83 years<br>for a person born today if you're a<br>woman that is about 78 if you're a man<br>incidentally the the difference between<br>men and women is one of the smallest in<br>New Zealand of any country but you know<br>compared to Japan probably not doing as<br>well as as we could do so looking at<br>secondary education you can see that in<br>virtually all countries have improved<br>the rates of second attainment of<br>secondary education you can see in New<br>Zealand there one below the OECD see the<br>average it's up there along with the<br>kinds of percentages that most of the<br>other developed countries are the<br>increased system quite is large because<br>that's because the attainment was or was<br>already quite good even in the past this<br>is where New Zealand really scores<br>extraordinarily highly it is the highest<br>in the world<br>in terms of feeling safe of all the OECD<br>countries in the world you feel safer<br>than any other people in the world<br>doesn't that feel good wonder whether<br>you are safer than all the other people<br>in the world you look okay this shows<br>the incidence of personal crime and I<br>don't know whether you can see in New<br>Zealand sits here after Canada Japan USA<br>Poland Israel UK in an easier Australia<br>Korea<br>so it's interesting to see that<br>Australia is actually slightly very very<br>very slightly safer whereas if you look<br>at the perception Australia's over there<br>in the red Australians feel really<br>unsafe I don't whether it's the threat<br>from you coming over and don't know no I<br>won't go there<br>but you feel really safe but in fact<br>we're about the same so I thought that<br>was interesting in terms of protected<br>areas New Zealand is up towards the<br>right so that's pretty good but then you<br>you are proud of the fact that you have<br>lots of a wild natural environment and a<br>huge great ocean to protect and so maybe<br>it isn't quite such a good statistic as<br>it might appear on the surface and then<br>in terms of municipal waste and this is<br>where I actually haven't checked this<br>statistic so I'm gonna actually have to<br>turn to Maryanne here and then see New<br>Zealand appears to be the worst country<br>in the world for waste to landfill your<br>recycling rates are atrocious I don't<br>know why that I don't know why that is<br>perhaps there is something behind them<br>which we can discuss later so anyway so<br>it's a mixed picture as it is for every<br>country you look at there are some good<br>some bad<br>and so on climate change nowhere near as<br>bad as Australia in terms of greenhouse<br>gas emissions per capita but still<br>nothing really to be very proud of so<br>again as I say a mixed bag so what are<br>we trying to achieve we're trying to<br>achieve sustainability and there are<br>lots of definitions of sustainability<br>lots of models of sustainability and<br>sustainable development the one that<br>most people gravitate to is the<br>definition by Brundtland which is now<br>quite old people are try and keep<br>rewrite trying to rewrite it all the<br>time I've tried to rewrite it myself but<br>this one always seems to to come back to<br>sustainable development is the<br>development it meets the needs of the<br>present without compromising the ability<br>of future generations to meet their own<br>needs so that means let's live well<br>today but let's do so in a way that<br>allows future generations to also live<br>well in other words let's not screw it<br>up for our kids it's a polite way of<br>putting that and most people and that is<br>now accepted as having three fundamental<br>pillars economic prosperity social<br>equality social justice and<br>environmental protection<br>and if any one of those things any one<br>of those pillars falls down then we<br>don't have sustainability so for example<br>if the environmental pillar falls down<br>then we can all be rich and that wealth<br>can be shared equally but we've got no<br>planet to live on<br>it's not really great we can have an<br>environment so we can have a nice<br>environment and a very socially<br>equitable society but we don't have<br>enough food enough money to buy food and<br>that's not very good either and if we<br>have a strong economy and a strong<br>environment but that all of that wealth<br>is centered in three people and all the<br>rest don't have anything then again<br>that's not very good so in other words<br>to provide sustainable development we<br>need all of these three pillars and the<br>argument is that this is exactly what's<br>been happening and yeah that's what<br>we're trying that so that that's what<br>sustainability is trying to avoid the<br>first attempt to do this with the<br>Millennium Development Goals these were<br>agreed in the year 2000 they ran to the<br>Year 2015 and there were really social<br>goals and they only applied to<br>developing countries so it was about<br>poverty hunger education health and so<br>on there was number 7 ensure<br>environmental sustainability but nobody<br>really paid any attention to that and<br>you know they actually had an impact if<br>you actually look the last 15 years to<br>2015 was really the first time that we<br>made major inroads in some of into some<br>of the major social issues facing the<br>world so in terms of extreme hunger in<br>other words people leave living on<br>poverty hunger the people living on less<br>than adult at 25 a day went from 47<br>percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 2015<br>that's that's massive I mean some would<br>argue that that's nothing to do with the<br>Millennium Development Goals that's to<br>do with rapid developments in China and<br>so on but whatever massive progress in<br>terms of a universal primary education<br>from 52% in 1990 60 percent in 2000 up<br>to 80 percent in 2015 again massive<br>strides made again some somewhat hides a<br>few little gremlins there because the<br>target was to achieve universal primary<br>education it didn't say anything about<br>the quality of that education so some<br>countries actually met that mile<br>schools and forcing kids to go and then<br>the kids just left home and there are no<br>teachers and so on so now the<br>sustainable development goals actually<br>try and rectify that in terms of looking<br>at quality of education so the<br>Millennium Development Goals a mixed bag<br>would generally some some really<br>significant progress but also the world<br>went backwards in some areas in terms of<br>inequality in terms of climate change in<br>the environment as I've just said and in<br>terms of conflict and refugees and there<br>are there are other rows as well and I<br>just want to do a little diversion just<br>for a few minutes to talk about<br>inequality because that's one of the<br>major transformational changes that<br>we've seen take place over the last 20<br>years about the increase in inequality<br>in the world now this is a little video<br>and so what I'm going to have to do<br>because the video doesn't run I'm gonna<br>have to run it up there's a chart I saw<br>recently that I can't get out of my head<br>a Harvard Business professor and<br>economist asked more than 5,000<br>Americans how they thought wealth was<br>distributed in the United States this is<br>what they said they thought it was<br>dividing the country into five RUF<br>groups of the top bottom and middle<br>three 20% groups they asked people how<br>they thought the wealth in this country<br>was divided then he asked them what they<br>thought was the ideal distribution and<br>92% that's at least nine out of ten of<br>them said it should be more like this in<br>other words more equitable than they<br>think it is now that fact is telling<br>admittedly the notion that most<br>Americans know that the system is<br>already skewed unfairly but what's most<br>interesting to me is the reality<br>compared to our perception the ideal is<br>as far removed from our perception of<br>reality as the actual distribution is<br>from what we think exists in this<br>country so ignore the ideal for a moment<br>here's what we think it is again and<br>here is the actual distribution<br>shockingly skewed not only do the bottom<br>20 percent and the next 20 percent the<br>bottom forty percent of Americans barely<br>have any of the wealth I mean it's hard<br>to even see them on the chart but the<br>top 1% has more of the country's wealth<br>than nine out of ten Americans believe<br>the end<br>higher top 20% should have mind-blowing<br>but let's look at it another way because<br>I find this chart kind of difficult to<br>wrap my head around instead let's reduce<br>the 311 million Americans to just a<br>representative 100 people make it simple<br>here they are teachers coaches<br>firefighters construction workers<br>engineers doctors lawyers some<br>investment bankers a CEO maybe a<br>celebrity or two now let's line them up<br>according to their wealth poorest people<br>on the Left wealthiest on the right just<br>a steady row of folks based on their net<br>worth will colour-code them like we did<br>before based on which twenty percent<br>quintile they fall into now let's reduce<br>the total wealth of the united states<br>which was roughly fifty four trillion<br>dollars in 2009 to this symbolic pile of<br>cash and let's distribute it among our<br>100 Americans well here's socialism all<br>the wealth of the country distributed<br>equally we all know that won't work we<br>need to encourage people to work and<br>work hard to achieve that good ol<br>American Dream and keep our country<br>moving forward so here's that ideal we<br>asked everyone about something like this<br>curve this isn't too bad we've got some<br>incentive as the wealthiest folks are<br>now about 10 to 20 times better off than<br>the poorest Americans but hey even the<br>poor folks aren't actually poor since<br>the poverty line has stayed almost<br>entirely off the chart we have a super<br>healthy middle class with a smooth<br>transition into wealth and yes<br>Republicans and Democrats alike chose<br>this curve nine out of ten people 92<br>percent said this was a nice ideal<br>distribution of America's wealth but<br>let's move on this is what people think<br>America's wealth distribution actually<br>looks like not as equitable clearly but<br>for me even this still looks pretty<br>great yes the poorest twenty to thirty<br>percent are starting to suffer quite a<br>lot compared to the ideal and the middle<br>class is certainly struggling more than<br>they were while the rich and wealthy are<br>making roughly a hundred times<br>that of the poorest Americans and in<br>about ten times that of the still<br>healthy middle class sadly this isn't<br>even close to the reality here is the<br>actual distribution of wealth in America<br>the poorest Americans don't even<br>register they're down to pocket change<br>and the middle class is barely<br>distinguishable from the poor in fact<br>even the rich between the top 10 and 20<br>percentile are worse off only the top 10<br>percent are better off and how much<br>better off so much better off that the<br>top two to five percent are actually off<br>the chart at this scale and the top one<br>percent this guy<br>well his stack of money stretches 10<br>times higher than we can show here's his<br>stack of cash REE stacked all by itself<br>this is the top 1% we've been hearing so<br>much about so much green in his pockets<br>that I have to give him a whole new<br>column of his own because he won't fit<br>on my chart 1 percent of America has 40<br>percent of all the nation's wealth the<br>bottom 80% 8 out of every 10 people or<br>80 out of these hundred only has 7<br>percent between them and this has only<br>gotten worse in the last 20 to 30 years<br>while the richest 1% take home almost a<br>quarter of the national income today in<br>1976 they took home only 9 percent I<br>think he's made his point so what you<br>see there is that there's really quite<br>an astonishing difference in terms of<br>inequality and that has just increased<br>rapidly over the last 50 years to the<br>point that in income inequality is now<br>lopsided that 8 men now own the same<br>amount of wealth as the poorest half of<br>the world and the world's 10 biggest<br>corporations together have a ravine a<br>combined revenue greater than 180 of the<br>poorest countries combined and if you<br>want to know who they are those are the<br>eight men and they are men<br>unfortunately so inequality is one of<br>those things that has<br>really stepped up so in the sustainable<br>development goals they set themselves an<br>aspiration to do to continue the good<br>work of the Millennium Development Goals<br>but also to do something else and it<br>said we underscore the sustainable<br>development goals should be<br>action-oriented concise easy to<br>communicate limited in number<br>aspirational global in nature<br>universally applicable applicable to all<br>countries taking into account different<br>national realities capacities levels and<br>developments and respecting national<br>policies and priorities yeah and you<br>know and then next tomorrow we'll do<br>something really difficult so trying to<br>get a hundred and ninety three countries<br>to agree that took well they tried for<br>three years over a million people<br>contributed to one line four and so on<br>and that's what they came up with now<br>you could argue that they've failed in<br>their tasks because that's hardly a<br>small number they're hardly concise so<br>they are by no means perfect but I think<br>that's absolutely truly and utterly<br>remarkable to get all of the world's<br>countries to agree on 17 sustainable<br>development goals underpinned by 169<br>concrete targets around poverty hunger<br>health education gender equality clean<br>water and sanitation clean and<br>affordable energy decent work and<br>economic growth industry innovation and<br>infrastructure reduced inequalities<br>sustainable cities and communities<br>responsible Kadampa consumption and<br>production climate change life below<br>water life on land peace justice and<br>security and partnerships for<br>development and you know it's really<br>difficult when you actually thought that<br>down like that to see which ones you<br>would actually throw out which ones of<br>those you don't want so you know and<br>after all we've managed to remember 10<br>commandments for about the last 2,000<br>years so maybe maybe 17 sustainable<br>development goals is not too far out of<br>our ability so that's what we have there<br>are some critical differences between so<br>these are just some of the targets this<br>identity there's some critical<br>differences between these the Millennium<br>Development Goals it integrates the<br>three pillars of sustainable development<br>you saw<br>they're about jobs about environment and<br>about social issues but the crucial<br>thing is that they apply to all<br>countries so they apply to New Zealand<br>as well as to Burkina Faso it's a plan<br>of action for people planet and<br>prosperity those three pillars it says<br>we are resolved to free the human race<br>from the tender and tyranny of poverty<br>and want and to heal and secure our<br>planet so this is now not trying to<br>reduce poverty reduce hunger this is<br>trying to eliminate it this is over a 15<br>year period it starts to be well to be<br>bold and transformative and as we bark<br>on the collective journey we pledge that<br>no one will be left behind and that's<br>really critical and that's one thing<br>that a lot of the developing countries<br>have really grasped is that this is this<br>is about everyone not just about that<br>richest 1% so why why are SDGs useful<br>wise goal-setting useful because it sets<br>benchmarks for government government<br>like targets they like ignoring them<br>when and avoiding them when they can't<br>meet them but they like targets they at<br>least they like to know where they're<br>going it mobilizes the community so if<br>you look at all of the aid agencies<br>around the world the World Bank the<br>Gates Foundation all of the major you<br>know charities and so on they're all now<br>focusing around the sustainable<br>development goals if you look at a lot<br>of the countries they are now focusing<br>on the sustainable development goals<br>countries from as disparate as Germany<br>and Colombia have set up ministries for<br>the sustainable development goals which<br>sit over all of the other ministries<br>Japan have set up an intergovernmental<br>Committee which sits again above all the<br>other ministries in order to achieve the<br>sustainable development goals so it<br>mobilizes the community it mobilizes<br>partnerships have you noticed that this<br>was what I said in here all countries<br>and all stakeholders pact Semien<br>collaborative partnership will implement<br>the patent so this isn't just from back<br>governments missus about mobilizing<br>partnerships between business civil<br>society government its person networks<br>that expertise so universities get on<br>board through things like the<br>sustainable development goals and it's<br>just a really nice to-do list it got<br>nice 17 pretty little icons that<br>everybody can get excited about so they<br>have actually done a first stab at how<br>each country performs against the SDGs<br>called the SDG index and I have to say<br>here that I am NOT a fan of the SDG<br>index because I think that some of the<br>things that are in the<br>Dex really don't measure the things that<br>you want to measure but it's a nice<br>little chart and you can look at it and<br>you can you can then start to have a<br>conversation about whether it's really<br>representative or not and what you can<br>see is that New Zealand does really<br>quite well in what New Zealand does<br>really quite well in terms of the goals<br>on the right-hand side and their most of<br>the sort of social goals the ones about<br>poverty and hunger and health and<br>education and then and then does less<br>well once you get round to the<br>right-hand side without things like life<br>on life on land life under water climate<br>change and things like that so how does<br>that compare to other countries<br>Australia's picture is very similar<br>Sweden are probably the best in terms of<br>being able to have a sort of uniform<br>picture but even they can't rest on<br>their laurels if you look at the u.s.<br>even more skewed and that left-hand side<br>now virtually disappears in terms of<br>their action on climate change in the<br>environment and this was pre Trump I<br>have to say so you can draw your own<br>conclusions as to what that might be in<br>three years from now and then you look<br>at a developing country someone like<br>Indonesia where clearly that the<br>challenges are apparent so even though<br>some of the data and some of the<br>statistics are very questionable in this<br>index it starts to show you that you<br>know it gives a solid graphical<br>representation of how of what you need<br>to focus on but a key message I'd like<br>to get across is that the sustainable<br>development goals are interlinked so<br>although there are 17 goals and 169<br>targets if it was only that easy but we<br>every we've looked at it and we've<br>examined it and we've studied it and<br>every one of those 169 targets has an<br>inter linkage with every other one of<br>those hundred and 69 targets you know<br>these are just a few examples you know<br>reduce food production due to drought<br>there's notification of deforestation<br>due to climate change clear links<br>between the hunger goal and the climate<br>change goal equal opportunities for<br>women's leads to a more dynamic and<br>productive workforce providing links<br>between gender equality and decent work<br>and economic growth they just go on and<br>on and on so why are interactions<br>important the UN secretary-general<br>described the sustainable development<br>goals as an indivisible whole but<br>everything new siloed<br>good reason government departments<br>university faculties international<br>organizations all sitting<br>discipline-based silos and sectors and<br>that's because it makes life easy it<br>makes it practical it makes things<br>doable you have a limited number of<br>people you have to talk to they all talk<br>the same language that you do and you<br>can get things done but you don't<br>necessarily end when you touch start to<br>try and to link those three pillars it<br>doesn't always get the right outcome and<br>if countries ignore the overlaps they<br>start to try and tick off targets one by<br>one they risk perverse outcomes and<br>that's happening at all levels from the<br>international level down to the local<br>level so the international level FAO<br>says well we'll have the food goal you<br>Knepp says well we'll have the to<br>environment goals WTO says we'll have<br>only we all have the economic goal you<br>know the World Energy Agency says well<br>we'll have the energy goal and they all<br>sort of grabbed their goal and how to<br>hold hold it like this and say you know<br>this is out too if you keep off and<br>that's exactly the what you don't want<br>to happen that's how we got in this mess<br>in the first place and it's just as an<br>example of one of these perverse<br>outcomes if we use coal to improve<br>energy access that would meet goal 7 but<br>it would accelerate climate change and<br>acidify the oceans so we're undermine<br>Goals 13 and 14 as well as well as<br>damaging health from air pollution which<br>is goal 3 so you have to win to link<br>these things and so the idea is to look<br>for targets that incorporate multiple<br>goals and look for the synergies you<br>know the win wins so energy energy<br>efficiency is a win win because it's<br>good for industry because it saves money<br>and you can invent new technology it's<br>good for it it's good for energy because<br>it meets the energy energy for all<br>target and it meets the climate change<br>goals so it's all synergistic and there<br>are many many of these synergies that<br>you can identify you can come up with<br>scales the way you manage these<br>inter-linkages because what you should<br>do of course is do a full systems<br>analysis try going up to your minister<br>saying dear minister please do a full<br>systems analysis before you make a<br>decision yeah right so that we've come<br>up with some simple tools you know for a<br>seven-point scale you know is it a plus<br>three or is it a minus 3 minister you<br>know is it strongly reinforcing or is it<br>is it really negative so just to make<br>you think through the interaction there<br>are other factors you need to think<br>about is what you're doing reversible<br>so for example if you eliminate a<br>species if it becomes extinct you decide<br>you've done the wrong thing you can't go<br>back and recreate that species whereas<br>if you've got a plot of land which<br>you're currently using for agriculture<br>and you decide you want to do sit for<br>biofuels and then two years later you<br>decide out so that was a bad idea you<br>can always put it back to agriculture<br>again so some things are reversible -<br>some things are irreversible there's<br>some things there's a direction and some<br>things you know operate in both<br>directions so providing energy to<br>people's homes and if it's education<br>through having light children being able<br>to do homework and improves gender by<br>women being able to work in the home at<br>night but improving education doesn't<br>provide energy so there's a one-way link<br>between energy and education which<br>somewhat the video obviously got in<br>somebody<br>strength is it really is it really<br>important interaction how certain or<br>uncertain are we about this interaction<br>is it something we know well in which<br>case we can be confident about the<br>decision we make or is something where<br>we're very uncertain we need to be very<br>careful about the decision we make<br>governance sometimes negative<br>interactions aren't really negative<br>interactions it's just poor poor<br>management just poor governance<br>geography some actions have<br>inter-linkages in other places or<br>countries if we dam Aruba to provide<br>water for agriculture for irrigation<br>then what does that do to the community<br>downstream that use that water for<br>fishery for fisheries you know some you<br>can have consequences in other in other<br>places time sensitivity some<br>interactions play out in real time some<br>have a time lag emissions of greenhouse<br>gases can stay around in the atmosphere<br>for a hundred years so when you take<br>your consequences into account you need<br>to take that factor that in and<br>technology can go both ways so these you<br>know the moving up and down this sort of<br>seven-point scale is is not fixed<br>because technology can actually open up<br>opportunities that were not there before<br>so renewable energy provides new options<br>of how we meet the energy for all goal<br>but equally technology can not<br>necessarily be a good thing it can<br>actually go the other way the fact that<br>we all have to change our mobile phones<br>every 10 minutes means that you know<br>we're using resources that perhaps we<br>don't need to and that we didn't of<br>course using the past<br>so all this says is really you really<br>need to think about these inter-linkages<br>when you start to implement their<br>sustainable development goals and of<br>course not every country can do<br>everything all at once and so countries<br>are going to have to prioritize<br>reflecting on the national context of<br>the sustainable development goals<br>I don't think Nepal is going to have a<br>great deal of effort focused on life<br>under water for example so you need to<br>prioritize but it's not okay to<br>prioritize on the basis of what is easy<br>or achievable which is a real temptation<br>it's not okay to prioritize just on and<br>report on what will make you look good<br>and it's not okay to ignore the<br>implications of action on your<br>priorities or other sustainable<br>development goals so in summary you must<br>take into account the inter linkages<br>we're taking action on the sustainable<br>development goals<br>I hope you've heard that message loud<br>and clear now you you must take into<br>account into linkages when you start to<br>take an take action on the sustainable<br>development goals and you can probably<br>figure out what the third one is I<br>really want to push this point home you<br>must take into account into linkages<br>when you take action on the sustainable<br>development goals which I hope we all do<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
