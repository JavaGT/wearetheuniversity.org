font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>The aspect of sustainability that I'm most interested in, is sustainable development.<br>So sustainable development is the ability of present generations to meet their own<br>needs, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs as well.<br>It's really about tying together these aims to achieve human development goals<br>and alleviate poverty and recognising the need to protect the environment, whilst<br>trying to create a sustainable future where people can have healthy and fulfilled lives.<br>Throughout undergraduate levels, we're really focused on understanding the<br>history of development, understanding what went right, what didn't, and why it<br>probably hasn't been as successful as the world expected.<br>And then it seems like for the rest of our degrees and our academic careers,<br>we head into asking what sustainable development is, what we want it to look like,<br>how can we achieve it and above all how are we going to make sure it lasts.<br>So, for me, that idea of sustainable development is really at the moral core of Development Studies.<br>At the time of apply for study, Victoria was the only university that offered<br>Development Studies as an option.<br>So to me that indicated that I was part of a university that was forward thinking,<br>that  was globally minded and that was committed to a global agenda.<br>Victoria offers a lot of networking opportunities, so in my undergraduate studies,<br>I participated in VILP, which is the International Leadership Programme.<br>They offer a lot of speaker and seminar events for you to take part in.<br>One sustainable action I do everyday, my daily life that what I'm most proud of is walking everywhere.<br>So I walk to university; I walk to work; I walk to get my groceries; I walk everywhere in between.<br>Reducing emissions is a really important part of becoming a sustainable city.<br>So, I do use the public transport system, but mostly I'm walking.<br>It's good for me, it's good for the environment, it's a win-win situation.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
