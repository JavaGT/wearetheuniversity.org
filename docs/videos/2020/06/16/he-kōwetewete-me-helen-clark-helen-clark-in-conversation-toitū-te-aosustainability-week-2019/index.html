here as well as a<br>capable City University we feel a<br>particular responsibility to foster the<br>kind of conversations you will enjoy<br>tonight we've a strong commitment to<br>sustainability and if I single out<br>climate change five of our staff are<br>lead authors for the next report from<br>the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate<br>Change one of the largest groups of<br>authors from any organisation to be<br>involved in preparing this<br>we're determined to ensure the results<br>of our research on climate change<br>enriching our teaching and our<br>organizational practices for instance we<br>were the first Museum in university and<br>one of the first universities in the<br>world to initiate divestment from carbon<br>emitting fossil fuels and later this<br>week<br>climate Minister the Honorable James<br>Shaw will be joining us for our launch<br>of our comprehensive new emissions<br>management program to achieve net zero<br>carbon emissions by 2030 climate change<br>and other aspects of sustainability are<br>the defining issues of our time and I do<br>hope you take advantage of our other<br>events during sustainability week to<br>learn more about them and to discuss how<br>they might be addressed I'm sure we can<br>expect insights aplenty this evening and<br>invite you to join me in welcoming the<br>right honourable Helen Clarke enjoy<br>greetings I think<br>kyouda Tartu and Thank You Vice<br>Chancellor on behalf of us both thank<br>you all for being here and thank you<br>both to the students and staff of<br>Victoria for organizing such a fantastic<br>event as a sustainability week it's just<br>great and to think that you've worked on<br>it together as well it's even better so<br>I'm here to introduce Helen who needs<br>absolutely no introduction so let's hear<br>it for Helen Clarke so Helen has become<br>I think an absolute leader for<br>sustainability far from retiring from<br>UNDP and leading a quiet life she's just<br>begun her foundation with three papers<br>out already and is truly a global leader<br>on these issues that we're going to talk<br>about now so I think we're very lucky<br>Helen to have you back home I know how<br>much you're aware at the moment you've<br>often said that 2015 was a remarkable<br>year it began with the Sendai framework<br>on disaster risk management it continued<br>with the end of the Millennium<br>Development Goals a lot of goals in this<br>conversation I have to warn you and then<br>it continued of course with the<br>development of agenda 2030 and the<br>sustainable development goals with over<br>a hundred indicators that's why I say<br>there's a lot of goals in this<br>conversation and then we had the Addis<br>Ababa agreement on financing for<br>development and all of this in the one<br>year today across in New York the United<br>Nations is assessing how far we've come<br>in that time and I can think of no one<br>better than Helen Clarke to give us an<br>idea of what progress we have made in<br>those five years and today they're<br>talking about this month being the<br>beginning of another ten years<br>of activity and delivery and that's kind<br>of what we'll talk about as well<br>so Helen SD jeez all of those acronyms<br>that you get out of the UN can you just<br>briefly talk about the sustainable<br>development goals and how they were<br>different from the Millennium<br>Development Goals so Thank You Jill and<br>thank you to the University for inviting<br>me along well I spent eight years in New<br>York at the sort of end of the period of<br>the Millennium Development Goals and<br>through the transition to this new<br>sustainable development agenda the<br>Millennium Development Goals came out of<br>the Millennium Declaration which was<br>issued by world leaders who came to New<br>York for the Millennium summit and for<br>those of you who can remember the dawn<br>of the new millennium it was actually a<br>time of quite a lot of hope that maybe<br>we could have a better home than the one<br>before and Coffee Anand you know spurred<br>the diplomats to negotiate<br>you know the visionary Millennium<br>Declaration and then out of that came<br>the the eight goals which were which<br>were referenced in the Declaration that<br>few years there was a bit of a feeling<br>that actually the diplomats hadn't<br>negotiated the goals so they didn't give<br>us much traction as perhaps they could<br>have early enough but the point about<br>the Millennium Development Goals was<br>that they were largely aimed at what<br>developing countries needed to achieve<br>that was the largely the first six goals<br>there was an environmental one there was<br>seventh but didn't get a lot of traction<br>and then a partnership goal and of<br>course quarter the partnership was<br>always money and the internationally<br>agreed goal for developed countries like<br>ours as to vote not point seven percent<br>of of gross national income Development<br>Assistance and only half a dozen<br>countries have ever achieved that and<br>one of those doesn't do it today so<br>money was always an issue but towards<br>the end of the Millennium Development<br>Goal period there was the Rio +20 UN<br>summit on sustainable development and<br>Rio de Janiero<br>20 years on from the earth<br>summer of 1992 and that major conference<br>mandated negotiations on a sustainable<br>development agenda which would not be<br>about things that developing countries<br>needed to achieve but would actually be<br>a universal agenda applicable to all<br>countries from New Zealand to somehow<br>here basically and it set out to promote<br>a holistic way of looking at development<br>so that you shouldn't be mortgaging the<br>future of future generations of the way<br>you trash the environment you know we<br>need stable ecosystems we need our<br>biodiversity so when we're thinking<br>about development we need it to be<br>consistent with maintaining ecosystem<br>integrity and of course traditionally<br>development hasn't been about that it's<br>been about you know pollute first and<br>then if you get to be a rich country you<br>clean up later but it's a it's a<br>struggle as as we know ourselves with<br>the state of our waterways and China<br>knows with the state of the air and its<br>cities and so on so yes the sustainable<br>development goals with many more a<br>number than the Millennium Development<br>Goals which has been a problem you know<br>you can just about remember eight goals<br>but 17 there's a struggle the eight<br>goals from the Millennium Development<br>Goal the era had 29 targets this agenda<br>has I think 169 and well over 200<br>indicators so it's quite complicated but<br>not withstanding that many countries<br>have embraced it fulsomely at UNDP as<br>the the agenda became you know very<br>clear even before it was signed off at<br>the summit in 2015 UNDP was leading<br>missions into countries that looked at<br>how you would integrate the sustainable<br>development goals into national plans<br>policies and budgets because actually<br>these agendas all stay as bits of paper<br>you know getting dust on shelves unless<br>countries really care about them and<br>grab them and take them home and say<br>this is important to us and we're going<br>to do something about it and not just at<br>the national government level also in<br>one of my roles as patron<br>of the Commonwealth local government<br>forum and it has been pushing for the<br>SDGs as it pushed for the MDGs to be<br>embraced at the local government level<br>so also implicit on the new agenda was a<br>very high level of civil society<br>participation endeavor to get the<br>private sector on board because how it<br>does business will have quite an impact<br>on whether development is inclusive and<br>and sustainable so you know it's a it's<br>a great agenda it's in the right<br>direction we should see the Paris<br>climate agreement as in synergy with it<br>because what's happened to the climate<br>ecosystem is a sort of subset of the<br>issues which affect natural ecosystems<br>in in general but are probably<br>anticipating a future question of Jules<br>but still in them all yeah if you tried<br>now to negotiate the agreements of 2015<br>you couldn't do it because of the<br>political changes and key capitals and<br>it's a pretty obvious what one of them<br>is but I mentioned Rio +20 Rio de<br>Janeiro<br>I mean Brazil was host of this major<br>conference and you had at that time<br>governments in Brazil that actually<br>cared about the Amazon you know and<br>cared about inclusion and and ecosystems<br>and you know now you have a president<br>who's basically incited people to set<br>fire to it so you know these changes are<br>really very very destructive and I think<br>that you know the least we can say for<br>democratic societies is you do get a<br>chance to vote again from time to time<br>so the the UN system and those who care<br>about these agendas must hang on to them<br>I must keep working at them in the hope<br>that the tide will turn and some key<br>capitals and you can get you know some<br>more action and by and again in the<br>future Helen you don't very unusual<br>thing around the SDGs at the very<br>beginning it's not often that the UN<br>actually goes out to people like us and<br>says what do you think what are the<br>issues<br>so you did what I think was pretty much<br>unheard of you arranged for a survey<br>around the world would you like to just<br>talk briefly about that and and what the<br>results of that show from the world we<br>want well I think again it was a it was<br>a lesson from the Millennium Development<br>Goals which were as I say came out of a<br>declaration that was negotiated by<br>diplomats in New York and didn't really<br>get traction and capitals for a long<br>time and then when the goals were<br>promulgated that was done ever sort of<br>hierarchical level in the UN and so<br>there wasn't the engagement you want<br>from societies around the world so yes<br>in my time at UNDP I had people there<br>who said we should change this you know<br>it's clear there's a mandate from Rio to<br>negotiate this new agenda but let's make<br>sure the negotiators the diplomats<br>actually hear voices of people from<br>around the world so there were three<br>sets of consultations one of them was<br>the global online survey which<br>eventually attracted 10 million<br>responses and if lists of the whole<br>range of areas every conceivable thing<br>that that could be in the SDGs and it<br>said in the survey identify the goals<br>that are most important to you of the<br>areas are the most important to you to<br>be reflected in these new goals now<br>globally what came out top and whatever<br>order was access to health access to<br>education and access to work right and<br>probably pretty much mirror priorities<br>here wouldn't it if we've got the health<br>system right and we've got you know<br>adequate income and we can get the<br>education that we aspire to this is<br>pretty important but interestingly the<br>fourth priority that came through<br>globally was honest government because a<br>lot of countries don't have transparent<br>and accountable government and citizens<br>know that you know they know that you<br>know governments steal governments don't<br>work in the public interest in many many<br>places so that was quite quite<br>interesting and probably had an impact<br>on the sustainable development goals for<br>the first time and development<br>goal-setting<br>having a goal on inclusive and<br>responsive governance for peaceful<br>societies which wasn't liked very much<br>by quite a lot of autocracies but on the<br>other hand there was a sort of you know<br>a bow wave behind it so that was one<br>rather important input then UNDP which<br>has up until after my departure been the<br>lead agency and the system led on<br>getting agencies to support national<br>consultations on the SDGs and close to a<br>hundred countries overwhelmingly<br>developing countries ran these and you<br>know the bottom line for the UN<br>facilitating them was very very wide<br>participation you to make sure that from<br>across the society social groups<br>if nests of these indigenous people the<br>poorest and most marginalised got a<br>voice and and then that of course puts<br>some pressure on the diplomats from<br>those countries to be you know sort of<br>listening to is that what people want<br>you know we better reflect that and<br>there are also global thematic<br>consultations that were hosted in them<br>about ten capitals so environment health<br>equality education etc etc so all of<br>this was to give a groundswell of<br>opinion from civil society both<br>community level NGO scientists<br>researchers you know that whoever you<br>could bring into this conversation and I<br>think that's really important to think<br>about because what you have in the SDG<br>is really is a desire for a more just<br>equal sustainable world so that that<br>builds that whole idea of sustainability<br>and so often people think about<br>sustainability as just about the<br>environment don't they but in terms of<br>human rights for example any comments<br>there Helen around the importance of the<br>SDGs in terms of social justice and<br>human rights yes well<br>this SDG 16 about peaceful and inclusive<br>societies and based on the rule of law<br>is very very important and it gives you<br>something to hang on for for civil<br>society advocating in situations can be<br>very very very difficult I mean if you<br>look at what the UN has contributed to<br>humanity since 1945 one of the most<br>important areas is in the whole human<br>rights pantheon of declarations treaties<br>protocols and so on which you know set<br>set a standard that countries can aspire<br>to and advocates can hang on to and and<br>you could say in you know quite a number<br>of countries more honor than the breach<br>than the observance but it's very<br>important to have that sort of set of<br>norms that people can can have as a<br>reference if you like<br>so yes the the SDGs can be supportive<br>that what was the other aspect of that<br>of that question yes I've completely<br>forgot to complete because I'm like yeah<br>I'm busy thinking in fact I think it's<br>important to to remember how critical<br>New Zealand's role was in the<br>development of both the League of<br>Nations and of the UN as well and in<br>terms of Human Rights one of the<br>differences I think to that Helen and I<br>would both regret in some ways is that<br>the SDGs are not a convention or a<br>treaty or a covenant so therefore they<br>don't require illegal or they don't have<br>a legal status in terms of the<br>commitments but then you wouldn't have<br>got agreement on a treaty noting this<br>it's very difficult now to negotiate new<br>Tricky's in the rather polarized world<br>that we we have and you know one of the<br>last significant UN rights treaties that<br>was negotiated was the Convention on the<br>Rights of people with disabilities and<br>New Zealand played a leading role in<br>that the Ambassador dawn Makai was one<br>of the lead lead diplomats on that<br>negotiation<br>the United States has never ratified<br>that and you know in certain contexts<br>wouldn't even have gone along with the<br>agreement because you have to have every<br>state agreeing to to these treaties so<br>the SDGs were always it was a<br>negotiation in the General Assembly it's<br>not binding but you know you get by and<br>I mean the government's all come and<br>sign it they they parade before the<br>high-level political forum to talk about<br>what they're doing about them or not<br>doing about them so there's a kind of<br>you know moral pressure and and my pick<br>is that as the years go on there will be<br>a bit of a panic about lack of progress<br>and I can come back to the second<br>progress at the moment and you'll see<br>more concerted activity probably in the<br>last five to seven years than you see at<br>the moment that's exactly the way it was<br>with the MDGs there was a rush on the<br>last the last five years so we have been<br>a 193 countries which did sign up to the<br>sustainable development goals to the<br>SDGs and just as a reminder one is about<br>climate change number 17 is about<br>partnership and in many ways that's<br>probably the most important partnership<br>between the private sector and<br>government between civil society and<br>academia and government in the private<br>sector so that's critically important<br>interestingly enough we just did am as<br>you know as survey of 186 organizations<br>here to do a people's report on New<br>Zealand's progress and and that was<br>interesting in itself but same to health<br>and education were placed first is the<br>most important to New Zealand today and<br>the one sadly that was placed lowest was<br>SDG 17 so there's something happening<br>there's something in the water if you<br>like at the moment about people feeling<br>not so strongly about partnership or not<br>believing it's possible and I think<br>that's an important point around<br>collaboration but I want to come back to<br>one thing Hillen you mentioned for<br>example the u.s. not signing up to the<br>Convention on disabilities today the<br>head of the Human Rights Council<br>Michelle Bachelet whom you know very<br>well<br>said that we have reached a point with<br>climate change with a cataclysmic degree<br>of global heating she didn't use warming<br>will make it impossible for any nation<br>Institute or person to stand on the<br>sidelines and yet the United States is<br>on the sidelines and some of you will<br>have heard president Trump say earlier<br>this week well I wasn't elected to<br>represent the people of Paris referring<br>to the Paris agreement on climate change<br>work that one out I wasn't elected to<br>represent the people of Paris and he<br>cannot for example tell the difference<br>between weather and climate it's<br>completely impossible it seems what do<br>we do about that this is serious stuff<br>we shouldn't be laughing but in fact<br>it's it's a bit like New Zealand with us<br>living standards framework which is the<br>focus of the government rather than the<br>SDG is what the two of course can fit<br>together we just need to make it more<br>formal but it's not as if we are in a<br>little bubble we're in the world where<br>one country's emissions and we per<br>person have a very high rate where one<br>country's emissions become another's<br>pollution until the u.s. joins<br>agreements on climate change and the<br>sustainable development goals what<br>chance have we got they are standing on<br>the sidelines you see the federal<br>government is missing in action but in a<br>sense life is moving on without them so<br>when Trump was elected he said it's<br>going to be a new age for coal and I<br>think he has an image that coal is still<br>mined by people who go down a pit with a<br>hard rather than toy heavy machinery<br>coal is down down down on the States you<br>know these mines aren't profitable there<br>was a report in the last in recent<br>months that said for the first time<br>power from renewable sources and the<br>states have exceeded the the generation<br>from coal my coals on the way up<br>whatever Trump's<br>it's going down the writings on on the<br>wall and secondly while the the federal<br>administration will flail around and say<br>these things the reality is that in the<br>powerhouse States something is being<br>done right California it doesn't matter<br>whether you've got a Republican or<br>Democrat government of California<br>they're going to act on climate change<br>because they're so impacted by it with<br>the the extreme heat and the fires and<br>and the droughts and so on so write down<br>that western seaboard the eastern<br>seaboard progressive states that you<br>find in middle america as well people<br>are doing things cities are doing things<br>and that's why I always said I've just<br>been in Australia doing a couple of<br>major events like like this one and<br>there's a lot of depression and<br>Australia after the last election where<br>you know the state of Queensland which<br>apparently doesn't like climate action<br>much didn't go the way of change but I<br>said well okay but fine but you've got<br>other levels of government in Australia<br>which which can act no and you've got<br>cities that can act cities of scale I<br>mean they've got you know greater<br>greater Sydney which you know not that<br>far off the population of New Zealand<br>probably if these major municipal areas<br>act you you get impact alright so yeah<br>in in a sense<br>I sort of disregard Trump's rhetoric<br>because I think there is action in the<br>United States and there are many people<br>who who see where it needs to go and you<br>talk about cities and local governments<br>so we're just coming up as we all know<br>to local body elections and in many ways<br>this is surely where the heart of the<br>sustainable development goals and also<br>much to address climate change because<br>the climate crisis can happen so my hope<br>would be and I think you would share it<br>that everybody in this room who goes to<br>listen to those standing from election<br>on whether it's DHBs open dhb for<br>example has reduced its emissions by 20<br>percent in the last couple of years what<br>would be the question you would ask<br>somebody standing for a local body<br>office in the next you know a few weeks<br>and the election what would be your<br>question<br>it was me what I would be asking is two<br>prospective candidates first are you<br>aware of the sustainable development<br>goals and are you aware of the new urban<br>agenda that came out of the habitat<br>three conference in 2016 and have<br>elected what will you do to make these<br>part of the agenda for the the city or<br>the district that the great thing about<br>local government and developed countries<br>is that well at a national level we long<br>ago abandoned national planning as it<br>were and really have to retrofit to do<br>things like climate action and SDGs<br>at the local level of course the Local<br>Government Act requires participate very<br>planning you know there has to be a<br>process and number of processes where<br>the public is consulted and and you<br>produce a plan and this is ideal for<br>something like climate action is per<br>Paris and for the sustainable<br>development goals and it you know it's<br>entirely possible for cities to grab<br>these agendas and say we want to base<br>our plan on these so that's what I would<br>be arguing and you know saying to the<br>cities you know will you come back to<br>being the the kind of inclusive and<br>sustainable city that these agendas<br>envisage and I think that's really<br>important and I think if every single<br>one of us went out from here and<br>actually asked that question we would<br>start to make people more aware Rotorua<br>for example has has done a great deal in<br>terms of you know developing itself as<br>an ESD geez City and Copenhagen is<br>apparently the most sustainable city in<br>the world wouldn't it be fantastic if<br>Wellington for example was to be able to<br>follow in its footsteps so I think<br>that's an exciting way so coming closer<br>to home how do you think New Zealand is<br>going it's just presented its first<br>voluntary national review to the<br>high-level political forum last month<br>the months before last showing its<br>progress<br>and I think Rwanda has presented five<br>reviews so far which has explored me<br>much of it around young people driving<br>change in Rwanda but how do you think<br>New Zealanders going well<br>new zealand hasn't really picked up the<br>SDGs despite you know than being<br>accepted and signed off by the previous<br>government John Key came up to the<br>summit and New Zealand self signed on<br>we're in the situation where sustainable<br>development goal agenda is is highly<br>consistent with a number of things the<br>government's doing from the well-being<br>budget to the living standards framework<br>to the new announcements on water the<br>climate action framework the zero carbon<br>bill you know that there's you know a<br>lot of things happening and in my<br>opinion it wouldn't be a Herculean task<br>to say let's put it in this this overall<br>framework and that would then make New<br>Zealand's reporting and what it had to<br>say about its work on STDs rather rather<br>more meaningful I've had a look at the<br>report that was put to New York and it<br>didn't really address the targets at all<br>the people's report which Jill and civil<br>society produced actually does go<br>through quite methodically and and I<br>think is an excellent report I mean one<br>of the issues and our system as I say as<br>long ago like other developed countries<br>we abandoned sort of planning capacity<br>so where you put something like this on<br>the government structure can be quite<br>challenging my own opinion is that<br>probably it would need to go as a<br>secretariat and Department of Prime<br>Minister cabinet and then the Prime<br>Minister also has ownership and<br>oversight of it and you have the<br>convening power to get ministries to to<br>work together and the key thing is to<br>get them out of their silos and start<br>thinking about the interactions of<br>policy across the economic social and<br>environmental so I think you know we<br>could do this now if you then go goal by<br>goal as as the<br>people's report did we also have some<br>challenges with us agenda look we don't<br>have the poverty of Somalia of course<br>but relevant to our situation it is<br>quite shocking that 23 percent of our<br>children are reported by our official<br>Department of Statistics<br>to be living in households that are<br>under the poverty line when you take<br>housing costs into account and you have<br>to take housing costs into account there<br>horrific because of what happened you<br>know the low end of the housing market<br>not enough investment in social housing<br>and and people becoming excluded if you<br>look at SDG - which is the goal on on<br>hunger and food security you might think<br>oh what's that got to do with New<br>Zealand we don't have famine well the<br>Ministry of Health official statistics<br>tell us that nineteen percent of our<br>children that's almost one in five live<br>in households that are classed as<br>moderately or severely food insecure so<br>we have issues on the most fundamental<br>sustainable development goals let alone<br>you know get to freshwater habitats and<br>quality or you know many many other<br>things if you take and I do very much<br>see the climate action agenda is you<br>know part and parcel of the SDG one if<br>you look at our greenhouse gas emission<br>footprint how aware in New Zealand is<br>that little New Zealand with its five<br>million people roughly per capita is the<br>twenty-first biggest emitter of<br>greenhouse gases in the world per capita<br>we're the fifth biggest emitter and the<br>OECD's<br>I think you know let's not think we're<br>not part of a problem we're part of the<br>problem so you know as I say there is<br>action in these areas but it might help<br>galvanize some more support furtive<br>people had a hyper awareness of the fact<br>that we can't be complacent I think<br>often we can place them we think that's<br>all right here well it's not all right<br>and it really is a bit of a call to<br>action I'm making - you know for people<br>to do what they can at whatever level<br>with<br>the University becoming sustainable this<br>city the you know their workplace and<br>and you know a bottom-up push to address<br>a range of these issues so I'm going to<br>open the floor to questions at the<br>moment but I have one question before<br>that some years ago you were at the<br>small island developing States<br>conference and some more which is also<br>in this month of September being<br>reported on in the UN and a group of<br>Pacific women who I think have huge<br>regard view met with you and you said to<br>them what's wrong what's worrying you<br>and of course they were confronting<br>climate change and the Prime Minister of<br>Palau saying every tonne of food that<br>comes from New Zealand should have a<br>health warning on it because of obesity<br>and so on and you said so what what's<br>wrong and they said it's too big but I<br>think many of us think this you know we<br>have this picture of a dystopia because<br>of climate change which is very bleak<br>they said to you it's too big what can<br>we do there's nothing we can do we feel<br>it's hopeless do you remember what your<br>answer was it's probably said start<br>where you can look I know what you say<br>it was<br>and I'm remember that ever since and<br>what you said was meta problems don't<br>always require meta solutions every<br>small step taken in the right direction<br>collectively can make a difference<br>that's very much part of your thinking<br>nothing oh yes but also for the very<br>vulnerable countries in the great oceans<br>like the the South Pacific States they<br>absolutely need international solidarity<br>because they are faced with challenges<br>which were not as they're making and<br>which very very expensive to adapt and<br>mitigate around and I guess many here<br>would have followed what happened at the<br>Pacific island forum recently where<br>Australia's stance was just met with<br>outrage by the South South Pacific<br>because they<br>ah seeing the rising of the ocean<br>affecting them in many ways and not only<br>by the mega storms which are becoming<br>more frequent and more intense but also<br>just you know plain ordinary agriculture<br>and cropping anywhere near the coastline<br>and then in many islands you capture<br>over the coastline you're living on the<br>coastline so the seawater inundation the<br>the spray making agriculture more<br>difficult and you can grow in these<br>conditions but you need adaptive plants<br>and technology for for that so it's an<br>existential threat for the small island<br>developing States what's happening with<br>the with the climate ecosystem and the<br>money promised by rich countries like<br>ours under the Paris agreement for<br>climate action as has really not come in<br>the Green Climate Fund has never<br>attracted a lot and if you add up the<br>the the bilateral aid spend it's not<br>fantastic either you also find in the<br>climate change conversation often a bit<br>of a disconnect in that developing<br>countries are very much talking about<br>the need for support for adaptation<br>where as our we need application to but<br>we also need a major mitigation<br>conversation but as well developing<br>countries need support for mitigation in<br>the sense that if they were to follow<br>the development path that we had with<br>polluting power and you know cutting<br>down all our forests and so on they<br>contribute to the problem as well so<br>support for renewable energy for putting<br>a you know economic value on the forest<br>standing rather than being cleared for<br>agriculture and this is really the issue<br>in the Amazon the Congo Basin Borneo etc<br>you know we're not going to resolve<br>these issues for the Pacific the<br>Caribbean the Indian Ocean Cape veered<br>and the Atlantic without international<br>solidarity no of course and we need the<br>systems in place and I think it's ironic<br>too that whereas here we are concerned<br>so much about<br>rising sea levels and then of course you<br>have spent a lot of time in North Africa<br>where we see the impact of<br>desertification and conflict and the<br>impact on women and I think that's an<br>area too that you have a particular<br>interest and yeah and remembering that<br>women are likely to be want 25 percent<br>more I think affected by climate change<br>so on their knowledge will open up to<br>descending the stairs if you wouldn't<br>mind putting up your hand and anyone who<br>would like to ask thank you so anyone<br>who would like to ask a question please<br>do again going back to climate it's<br>effective<br>well increasing the number of climate<br>refugees both in developed and<br>developing countries and still the Human<br>Rights Commission and other<br>organizations focus on refugees haven't<br>reached an agreement of on how to define<br>what's a climate refugee some of them<br>focus more on political refugees some<br>other call them environmental migrants<br>and meanwhile well we can see what's<br>happening in the Bahamas the potential<br>sea level rise affecting the Pacific<br>Islands Jakarta is moving 10 million<br>people into Borneo back many examples<br>and still up to this moment there is not<br>a proper definition of what a climate<br>change is so I think although it sounds<br>trivial it actually affects a lot the<br>process of taking decisions what's your<br>opinion about it well last year there<br>were two new compacts adopted by the<br>international community<br>one was the the one on refugees which<br>didn't have much to say on this area<br>you're quite right but the global<br>compact on migration<br>which ended up becoming quite<br>controversial because the Americans<br>wouldn't silent and the Australians<br>wouldn't say and so on and you know<br>there was even a flurry here with you<br>know some people trying to claim it was<br>a breach of national sovereignty which<br>is ridiculous but of course New Zealand<br>signed it in the end but that compact<br>did give civil society actually a sort<br>of step in to be able to pick up the<br>issues of climate and Joost migration<br>there is a reference there that as you<br>know at least mildly positive as it were<br>but you know this really comes back then<br>to the the adaptation issue how our<br>country is going to adapt to to these<br>forces the World Bank had a study out<br>early last year as I recall which<br>projected that in the worst case<br>scenario which is probably what we're<br>facing that you would get climate<br>refugees amounting to about 2.3 percent<br>of the populations of South Asia<br>sub-saharan Africa and Latin America and<br>that's a lot of people that didn't count<br>East Asia and Southeast Asia which also<br>very very badly affected it made the<br>point that most people you know fleeing<br>from where they've lived because of<br>climate change will not go over<br>international borders they will be<br>internally displaced people and what<br>what insight you gain from that is that<br>if people are being pushed back from<br>villages on the coast and coming to<br>cities then adaptation is also about how<br>you organize and provide for significant<br>populations coming in from either areas<br>that are experiencing impossible and<br>recurrent droughts like in the Horn of<br>Africa or or the sea water inundation<br>and Southeast Asia or whatever the Bank<br>study looked at some hot spots where<br>people pretend<br>she would go over borders and the extent<br>to which that could be a hot spot also<br>for for violent conflict with newcomers<br>coming in so there are some very very<br>big issues around this but I think I<br>think the global compact on migration<br>does have a framework where we can start<br>to have a more intelligent conversation<br>around these issues certainly<br>desperately needed another question I'll<br>take one in the front thank you I come<br>to the back next hello I was wondering<br>what your thoughts were on New Zealand's<br>dance around declaring a climate<br>emergency and just any sort of theories<br>or thoughts you might have on the<br>implications that something like that<br>could have in the future well the<br>situation is very urgent I suppose have<br>you cleared an emergency it would be a<br>you know a call to action and and I<br>really use it to propel forward the zero<br>carbon bill and you know many things<br>that have to be done<br>I suppose my caveat would be that<br>sometimes when you talk crisis and<br>emergency it can be disempowering as<br>well of people thing on it's just<br>hopeless you know go and play golf on<br>something else so I think in this whole<br>debate we need a sense of agency that<br>there are things that people can do and<br>and that you should be demanding of your<br>governments and at every level and and<br>that you can do in your own community in<br>your workplace and your institution and<br>so on so you know if we're really going<br>to get changed I think that encouraging<br>that sort of push from the society level<br>isn't is extremely important I I'd be<br>interested to know for example whether<br>those of you who are in who are working<br>not not here at Victoria I don't know<br>the answer here but if all the<br>organisation's people work for have for<br>example a climate policy and how that<br>impacts on procurement or sustainment we<br>just did a survey recently and only<br>sixty percent of the NGOs we surveyed<br>hundred may see something had either<br>or sustainability policy or specific<br>procedures so that's one thing that can<br>be done along with those others and as I<br>say what I have seen a lot of in other<br>countries and you wouldn't have to is<br>the localization of a global edge in<br>there so young people in particular<br>leading the charge in making a<br>difference where they live and that's<br>why I come back to local bodies and<br>where we live as well and know it's not<br>enough by itself as Helen Sue's<br>at the back there was a question that to<br>hi there coughs chambers here thanks for<br>the discussion my question is for you<br>Helen in it I guess<br>how would you characterize will describe<br>your mental and emotional states over<br>there over the journey you've been on<br>and I guess I'm curious about in the<br>face of what you described as<br>polarization of capital cities and kind<br>of adverse some some decent headwinds<br>for the sustainability agenda and some<br>slower progress how do you get inspired<br>and stay positive because he seemed<br>quite positive tonight and you're<br>encouraging action and talking a lot<br>about it so yeah I'm curious about how<br>you stay energized well my other two<br>does you're a long time dead so you<br>might as well make you know make the<br>most of the opportunity you've got to<br>you know motivate people to to really<br>believe that it is possible to go where<br>we need to go and there are hit wins no<br>question I mean you know don't you feel<br>a headwind every time you open the the<br>newspaper or 10:00 on the BBC or look at<br>the x news F or something I mean really<br>the most ridiculous things happening in<br>the world but there's also incredible<br>people doing amazing amazing things that<br>we must take out our inspiration from<br>them and and support those in our own<br>society who are really trying to make a<br>difference on these issues I think I<br>think that that's very true and I mean<br>there are some good news stories to tell<br>in many ways of the last ten years of<br>development under the MDGs and elsewhere<br>that is one finance experts in what is<br>it we have to stop borrowing money we<br>don't have<br>from to buy things we don't need to<br>impress people we don't care about<br>something all of us can do I suspect in<br>it's a consumerist kind of I mean I<br>Drive a Prius and their white Prius and<br>I think people think I'm an uber till I<br>get out they realize it's going on the<br>side we haven't been to the lives and I<br>think we should go to the lift it's our<br>lift anyone over here right now it's<br>exciting to you talking about taking<br>action I'm trying to take action to know<br>about a river amazing woman is leading<br>the charge against the what the landfill<br>is doing to the river thank you so I'm<br>trying to protect wine or your motto<br>river from our local body politicians<br>who think that the the floodplain of a<br>river is a good place to put clean fill<br>and as you said Helen in a tweet to me<br>clean filled by any other name as<br>landfill and I'm taking action and I've<br>had a website and I'm working hard I've<br>had a public meeting and trooper<br>mellowed and politicians came along and<br>it was fantastic<br>but where I met now is the council are<br>doubling down they've just contacted us<br>today via social media saying that all<br>they want to do is change a couple of<br>truck movements in the yeah in their<br>application for a consent and I'm at a<br>loss like what do we do nice I need to<br>mobilize Peter and I I'm not only twenty<br>minutes like Lowell huts just down the<br>motorway you guys but I feel like I'm<br>living in a third world country when the<br>rest of the the world is declaring<br>climate change and an emergency and<br>there's a count so 20 minutes<br>on the road that wants to put a clean<br>fill on the floodplain of the one who<br>Yamato river so any more advice would be<br>gratefully received<br>yeah and and I think you know the the<br>question to the the candidates has to be<br>you know where is the vision for where<br>we need to go with waste I mean what<br>about zero waste to landfill<br>what about reduce reuse recycle I mean<br>where we have to get to is that we don't<br>have any more landfill right and and<br>let's face it landfills are also surface<br>a not insignificant source of methane<br>emissions so yeah I mean this is the<br>time to be talking about it because it's<br>local body elections I'm and hold people<br>accountable it's probably a few of us in<br>this room that would come along with you<br>in the meantime I guess as some<br>hospitality absolutely it's ketchup<br>after this yes this is wonderful we<br>don't seem to hear much about in the<br>conversation about human global<br>population and I wondered Helen in your<br>role in the ug UNDP how much is there<br>being talked about in trying to slow the<br>rate of growth yeah well my opinion is<br>that just as happened in our own society<br>as as women get education and access to<br>services and economic empowerment and<br>rights they make their own decisions I<br>mean you know if you think of you know<br>the generations of our own families you<br>know I think of my grandparents who<br>three out of the four were members of<br>families with nine ten or eleven<br>children each and we've seen family size<br>come down dramatically with access to<br>contraception woman defining the kinds<br>of lives they want to lead having access<br>to education and so that's that's where<br>the emphasis needs to be on you know<br>it's basic human development<br>giving people agency knowledge you know<br>the the right to make the choices about<br>their lives and you will see population<br>come down when that happens but you know<br>one of the sad things again about and<br>Jill could speak with great authority on<br>this as well is every Republican<br>President of the United States from and<br>including Reagan's time on has cut all<br>funding to the UN Population Fund which<br>does the you know the hard yards<br>alongside the organization's Juliet used<br>to represent a family planning because<br>unless these organizations will rule out<br>ever saying anything positive or doing<br>anything positive about abortion they<br>get all the US funding cut off and so<br>you know sexual and reproductive health<br>and rights is a big issue in in the<br>global community and on that score watch<br>in November mid-november there will be a<br>major UN conference in Nairobi and it's<br>roughly called the Cairo plus twenty<br>five conference because in 1994 there<br>was a landmark conference in Cairo which<br>set the sexual and reproductive health<br>and rights agenda and actually many have<br>been scared to run another conference in<br>case it went backwards particularly in<br>the current political context but it<br>will be a conference where you'll see<br>all the people really pushing for people<br>to have access to services to know their<br>rights to you know to have empowerment<br>to come and you know talk about the<br>issues and I think generally it's summed<br>up by a belief that women want more for<br>their children rather than more children<br>generally speaking if they are able to<br>have that choice if they have such so<br>one last question please at the back<br>corner thank you<br>I there have been some strong messages<br>here today and it's my question would be<br>about getting the message out because we<br>live in an Information Age and there's<br>loads of different ways of of delivering<br>this message but the message is often<br>lost in silos of people and I'm sure<br>everyone here has similar viewpoints<br>which is why we come today but is there<br>any way forward that the delivery<br>message of social media and your time<br>and partner and politics and the advice<br>you'd give on getting the message out or<br>what's on the horizon because even with<br>the fires have been happening it took us<br>four to five months to get it into our<br>media and yet it was only really focused<br>on the Amazon when there was far worse<br>events happening around the world at the<br>same time and during that period like<br>just seems to be a disconnect and how do<br>we change that mm-hmm well yes I mean<br>think of the Siberian fires which are<br>also very very disastrous and I've just<br>been in Australia over the last couple<br>of days here we are early spring and<br>there are bush fires raging in<br>Queensland New South Wales now you know<br>what we're not even near the summer I<br>mean it's really incredible to me the<br>Australian federal government level<br>they're not you know so reading the tea<br>leaves some what's happening the climate<br>it's a very very strange but anyway how<br>do we get the message out in many ways<br>it's much easier now then it was when I<br>was active in politics here because that<br>was really pre social media you know<br>Twitter only goes back to about 2008<br>right Facebook was B it was just sort of<br>getting underway then so we we live in<br>an age where it is easy to connect<br>communities of course there is the point<br>that people may live and they're their<br>own bubble but you know if there are<br>more ways of going up to rect to public<br>opinion than they ever used to be when<br>we were dependent on traditional media<br>taking taking an interest but I think<br>it's a question of you know raising<br>these issues by through<br>maybe channels through the opportunities<br>that present themselves with candidates<br>meetings for elections local or<br>otherwise in your own organizations<br>around the teacups at the family<br>gatherings I mean you know word-of-mouth<br>is a very powerful thing and if everyone<br>begins to have the same conversation and<br>join the dots about what's happening you<br>know hope hopefully it becomes you know<br>some some momentum for action and buy<br>into what what needs to happen here to<br>address the issues as well as globally<br>and I think that's probably a very good<br>note to end on which brings us back to<br>this idea of each of us taking those<br>steps in any way we can and joining up<br>with government to do it Helen this a an<br>african saying of a katoki which goes<br>when the music changes so must the dance<br>and i think you have convinced us very<br>clearly the music has changed the dance<br>that we all do must change but there is<br>hope and there is a whole raft of things<br>we won't even have begun to think of<br>just as for example our grandparents<br>would not have dreamed that we would<br>lead the life will it do today and I<br>think if people like those in this room<br>spread the word in the way you've<br>described then that in itself will be<br>enormously important so I just want to<br>thank you on behalf of us all for your<br>leadership around the globe it is<br>amazing you're a one-woman machine in<br>all sorts of ways but what the good that<br>you do in the in writing and speaking<br>and with your new foundation to raise<br>people's awareness from all of us
