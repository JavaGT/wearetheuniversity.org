font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Carbon footprint of an individual in New<br>Zealand is about a ton of carbon per year<br>on average, per person, but then it depends how much streaming you do and<br>then how much data you have stored in<br>the cloud.<br>The personal choices that we make, the biggest personal choice of influence that is streaming.<br>So videos, Skype calls, downloading large documents, gaming online,<br>those kind of heavily, image intensive operations that we all carry out.<br>Data in industry is supported by electricity.<br>That is the dominant source of energy and most energy in most places is created<br>by fossil fuels, so that means there's a lot of carbon generation associated with the internet.<br>Internet usage is pretty much doubling in the next couple of years.<br>That means more power, more and more data piling down, that's driving up the amount<br>of data that needs to be stored and the metadata that needs to be transmitted.<br>You can cut down your footprint by half by using SD rather than HD movies.<br>Don't overpower the tech that you use, a smaller TV uses less power, so sit closer<br>to a smaller screen and that's one thing you can do you can do.<br>Send links rather than sending attachments.<br>That means there are fewer megabytes flying around the web.<br>Other things we can do is, we could all sign up for Fibre because it costs more<br>energy to push data down a copper line than it does down a fibre line.<br>The Internet is not the most energy-intensive thing we do, but because we do<br>it so much and we're doing more and more, it's becoming one of the most<br>important that's under our control to modify.<br>We want warm homes, but do we need to watch so many movies?<br>The fact that were kind of living with today is that the companies that facilitate these,<br>these networks and these storage opportunities, but of course also the<br>social networks and interconnectivity,<br>the companies that facilitate these kind<br>of deliberately want us to not delete everything, or anything,<br>as we all live with these multiple identities on the internet.<br>Facebook is a good example, where even when deleting your account they will keep<br>that still because they can still use it for further monitisation and potentially<br>selling off that data to third-party companies.<br>For example, a unique email address that is not yet part of known databases.<br>That's about 25 cents, US dollar cents.<br>I think it's important for people to realise that there's certain types of preventative<br>measures that you can take in these things, kind of similar to preventative medicine in a way.<br>We have to become more cautious about putting our data just about anywhere.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
