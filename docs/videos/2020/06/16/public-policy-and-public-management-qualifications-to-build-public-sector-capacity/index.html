School of<br>Government is the only one of its kind<br>in New Zealand we've been teaching<br>public policy for over 40 years in<br>public management for 20 years my name<br>is Verna Smith and I'm the program<br>director for the master's programs and<br>the School of Government and that<br>includes the master of Public Policy the<br>master of public management and the<br>master of the e-government all designed<br>to increase the capability of people in<br>the public sector or the master of<br>public policy degree you're really<br>looking to create fear and effective<br>policymaking capability what it does is<br>it goes your holistic view of government<br>in New Zealand a lot of people within<br>their own departments wouldn't<br>necessarily have an understanding of how<br>different processes of government or<br>machinery government works I think this<br>you know it brings everything together<br>quite nicely an awareness of things like<br>ideology and power and trade-offs so for<br>every decision that you make someone's<br>advantage and someone's disadvantage and<br>how do you process that and in the<br>public sector how do you make that okay<br>how do you make that politically<br>palatable so there's a critical<br>perspective really that course has<br>helped me to develop well you need to be<br>able to break down things into the<br>different stages of policy development<br>ranging from developing a framework all<br>the way down to monitoring and<br>evaluation of policy implementation<br>probably the main thing I've got out of<br>it is just a real sort of broad<br>understanding of policy and so you can<br>sort of see how it applies in lots of<br>different areas which I might not have<br>had so soon otherwise the public<br>management it's much more about leading<br>change managing for results and really<br>contributing to the operational<br>effectiveness of public service<br>organisations I was really keen to<br>undertake this program to help me in<br>terms of professional development to<br>learn more about public management<br>understanding the context that I work in<br>and also how it can be an effective<br>manager a big learning for me was just<br>understanding the wider context<br>of Public Management the wider political<br>context that was so interesting for me<br>and it actually made me think ah so<br>that's why things are like this and it's<br>really important for public servants to<br>understand this and for ego vermin<br>that's very specifically targeted at<br>enabling IT transformations in public<br>services and that can be using IT for<br>better government or managing IT<br>projects and implementing IT projects<br>and a capable and a competent and<br>effective way for us the e-government<br>course is very much about building<br>future services in ways which perhaps<br>even we can't imagine them being<br>delivered and people choosing that<br>course are going to be the real<br>innovators of the services of the future<br>a lot of the lecturers and the academic<br>staff have been involved in policy<br>research policy analysis policy<br>management themselves so they bring<br>real-world experience into this as well<br>being able to work on issues that were<br>not just topical but incredibly relevant<br>in the current policy space where you<br>might be dealing with case studies in<br>another university here you were working<br>on issues of important app it wasn't<br>detached from your own work experience<br>and I think for public servants that's<br>really important especially those who<br>are studying and working full time so I<br>guess a big tech to the School of<br>Government for using that approach one<br>of the most attractive things about the<br>master's program is that it is offered<br>in many different formats and we've<br>designed those formats so that they're<br>most helpful for people who have busy<br>working professional lives yeah<br>definitely all the professors who are<br>quiet considerate of you know sometimes<br>we can get quite busy and you might not<br>be able to meet a certain deadline so<br>yeah they're quite flexible with that<br>and understanding you know that really<br>is for you to get through the program<br>the proximity to decision-makers that we<br>here in the School of Government has<br>a really defining feature and a defining<br>advantage of the master's programs here<br>we regularly interface with<br>decision-makers we can go and see them<br>in action many of our teachers actively<br>work with them and developing policy it<br>is a school which is intimately bound up<br>with the business of government and it<br>is a very very unique quality I'm every<br>day using things that I have actually<br>learnt in this program has taught me a<br>lot about how to look at a problem how<br>to approach it these are things that I<br>think would take me you know 5 to 10<br>years to build up if I was actually just<br>working in the public service in terms<br>of the benefits it's it's really helped<br>me in terms of my thinking and it's<br>definitely helped me in terms of<br>different theories and approaches around<br>public management so I definitely feel<br>more confident in terms of myself as a<br>as a public manager yeah now I found it<br>really valuable I think it's really<br>complemented what I do on a day-to-day<br>basis and giving me a bit more of a sort<br>of like understanding of the policy<br>development process and give me some new<br>tools that I can use and work as well I<br>definitely recommend someone studying in<br>Victoria I think it just offers a really<br>good opportunity the upskill and just<br>gives you a nice underpinning that you<br>can build from in your professional<br>career</p></main><footer
