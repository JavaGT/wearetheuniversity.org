She is a physician scientist with expertise in epilepsy phenotyping and epilepsy genetics. Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological illness of children affecting nearly 50 million people world-wide.<br><br>Lynette’s research, combining international collaborations with physicians and laboratory scientists, has led to the discovery that the majority of epilepsy is caused by abnormalities in genes. Although it is known what these abnormalities are in some epilepsies, there are still many types of epilepsy for which the genetic change remains elusive.<br><br>Over 2000 New Zealanders are participants in Lynette’s epilepsy genetics project. Professor Sadleir is the president of the New Zealand League Against Epilepsy. She is presently the chair of the International League Against Epilepsy Budget Review Committee and a member of the International League Against Epilepsy Clinical Genetic Testing in the Epilepsies Task Force.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hee hee<br>we know that you turn a quarter<br>welcome and we acknowledge leadership of<br>in the mana I'm gonna rock it to the my<br>telephoto tempo total time talk no data<br>Komeito Cove Carlene ain't go to<br>Milwaukee over Nami he knew a few<br>coaches up tempo tempo times no collars<br>good evening everyone my name is party<br>Haines and I have the great privilege of<br>being the Vice Chancellor here at the<br>University of Otago and it is an<br>enormous pleasure for me to welcome you<br>to this inaugural episode or lecture or<br>the best urban etc I'd like to begin by<br>thinking TOA forth his outstanding<br>welcome this evening and I'd also like<br>to have a few words button to some<br>special guests that we have here this<br>evening as you probably heard me say<br>many times these inaugural professorial<br>lectures are a time of great celebration<br>for the University of Otago and it's<br>fantastic to see so many people here to<br>help celebrate this incredible hallmark<br>in the next career now in addition to<br>our colleagues there are a number of<br>special guests in the audience this<br>evening that deserve a bit a special<br>welcome the next husband day is here and<br>we very much are glad to have him here<br>in the presence of family members<br>so is such a clear signal of the<br>importance of dissipation but I also<br>like to welcome some other special<br>guests that I think are in the audience<br>this evening I understand that Manette<br>extended an invitation to many other<br>participants in her epilepsy genetics<br>research project and in fact I<br>understand in front of Manette that<br>almost all of the children with epilepsy<br>that Manette has looked after<br>clinically are also part of her research<br>project which has been going on for 20<br>years so tonight in addition to<br>celebrating the next promotion professor<br>this also gives us a very public<br>opportunity to thank you the<br>participants in her search for the very<br>generous amounts of time you've been<br>given and hopefully what you will hear<br>tonight will elucidate some of the<br>amazing contributions that your time has<br>made to helping us understand the<br>genetics of epilepsy so to all of you<br>now the path success of the University<br>of Otago is never an easy one in order<br>to achieve that right the applicant must<br>demonstrate excellence in teaching in<br>research and in service to the<br>University and the wider community as<br>you will learn on the basis of the next<br>lecture this evening honor she is an<br>effective and motivating teacher and<br>she's also a highly sought-after an<br>engaging public speaker so I want and<br>very much looking forward to hearing<br>from her to see me Lynette is also a<br>very successful and well-funded<br>scientist and tonight we are all going<br>to have the opportunity to learn more<br>about her groundbreaking research on the<br>genetics and last but certainly not<br>least when that is also providing an<br>exceptional service and leadership to<br>the wider international research<br>community all of this activity is all<br>the more impressive because it is<br>happening against the backdrop of a very<br>very busy clinical practice here so the<br>next on behalf of the University of<br>Otago it gives me great pleasure to hear<br>actually on a very well-deserved<br>commercially - professor I will now call<br>on the associate dean of the University<br>of Otago Wellington to tell us just a<br>little bit more about the next journey -<br>professor<br>another my role was sticky Dean of the<br>University of Tokyo an attempt on us but<br>also I know very well a little balcony<br>over canvas and thank you for coming to<br>this lecture and I bring experiences<br>here apologies from business any comment<br>who really added to the nature is a<br>graduate of the University of Otago and<br>I think this myth the net when I came to<br>move here in 1995 and I don't know if it<br>was connected that she lived a year<br>later and we to make lumen and the<br>spirit training in urology<br>and I am over over a long period of time<br>she graduated RCP in 99<br>a senior and department we work from the<br>same department innocence she was<br>promoted to associate professor of 2014<br>as highly anticipated Lynette is a<br>physician scientist so she combines a<br>clinical practice with her research and<br>her expertise as an English you feel at<br>home and she's going to tell you more<br>about that I think so but she is<br>important understand that she leads on<br>over the years it makes you a search for<br>it here at the University of Mary<br>Wellington but has been able to very<br>prestigious research groups in at the<br>University of Melbourne and overseas<br>they all work together and made amazing<br>discoveries and units of authority to<br>undertake this research that is very<br>immediately translational then is just<br>secured external research funding of<br>over 4 million followers<br>this together as well as other money<br>through other grants and she's had to<br>HSC project grants which is moving feet<br>particularly as a conditional scientist<br>she's had Federation's<br>around the world as I have suggested<br>I've indicated that she's got over my<br>publications now related to this work<br>for the patron dates of 27 and 3615<br>citations as our October this year and<br>it's important also that you understand<br>that she's really on the international<br>stage and regards to her service in<br>regard to eclipsing and the significant<br>roles on the International League<br>against Italy when she established a New<br>Zealand chapter event in 2005 as far as<br>prison - six years been president for<br>six years and so she's really advocated<br>for energy here in New Zealand and for<br>more information and patient information<br>related to that the other thing that I<br>think is a huge significance it was that<br>she was a member of the<br>the pacification passport so this was an<br>international task force who had they<br>had a job deciding on the new diagnostic<br>test equations but equitably and she was<br>responsible for creating seizures with<br>videos and putting them online and then<br>it's an online resource that's used<br>internationally and we are very lucky<br>because that resource is also used to<br>teach our students and it's probably<br>something to do with the fact that she<br>always it 100% fantastic feedback from<br>the students in began to be teaching and<br>so much being ever just teaching<br>vehicles years she's also teaching<br>pediatricians both here and overseas in<br>regards to epilepsy and last Friday if<br>it was I wonder what a him at an<br>apartment because there was nobody<br>around to teach so then it is not a<br>given most courses that she's involved<br>internationally in the curriculum most<br>courses so as well as doing all that<br>it's because we have small departments<br>had to take on the usual role so firstly<br>from meeting and she's currently a 16<br>demeanor and she's been acting<br>at times and she does this academic<br>appointment had a point for clinical<br>appointment and I might other than it is<br>very well supported by husband Davis we<br>see today and the son Sean who I know<br>will be watching us on stage and I just<br>have to acknowledge you Sean because<br>there's a very young child your career<br>has really gone from strength to<br>strength and that's been exciting for me<br>thank you very much Don bits and pieces<br>in the right places I've got lots of<br>wires everywhere so thank you very much<br>Don and thank you very much to all of<br>you for coming to listen to me talk<br>today I was just when Don was talking I<br>was reminded me of the fact that about<br>24 years ago just after dawn arrived and<br>I escaped I I was a pediatric register<br>and I really didn't know what I wanted<br>to do and I knew I wanted to come back<br>to Wellington and I had accepted a job<br>at BC Children's Hospital and doing<br>pediatric neurology which wasn't<br>something I really wanted to do but<br>everybody around here and said that<br>would be a good thing to do if I wanted<br>to come back to Wellington and I<br>remember sitting in the airplane just as<br>we were taking off with Dave and in<br>flying at a Wellington thinking okay<br>take a breath you gonna do pediatric<br>neurology it's all going to be good and<br>then I thought to myself I hope I don't<br>have to see too many people with<br>epilepsy I really don't understand it<br>and I was lucky because I was at a<br>fantastic hospital with two amazing<br>clinicians Mary Connelly and Kevin<br>Farrell who not only taught me well an<br>awful lot about epilepsy but really<br>imparted on me the passion that they had<br>for helping people with this disorder so<br>I'm gonna get started and and going to<br>so I'm gonna okay you had talked to you<br>about the teams I've been involved in<br>the genes that we've found and the<br>dreams that we have so first of all just<br>to make sure everybody is knows what<br>we're talking about and it's epilepsy<br>now you're all sitting there oh sorry<br>wrong let's go back here let's see it<br>should just there we go okay so this is<br>what's happening in all of your brains<br>right now you've got your brain cells<br>and they're busy sending electrical<br>impulses to all the other cells and that<br>allows you to hear me and to see and to<br>think and that's all normal these<br>electrical activity is what makes your<br>brain work but every once in a while<br>people can have electrical activity that<br>they don't want to have and it's<br>associated with a clinical symptom or a<br>sign and that is what we call an<br>epileptic seizure and seizures are<br>common so one in 20 people will have a<br>seizure at some stage in their life an<br>epilepsy is a disorder or a group of<br>disorders on so I'm going to tell you in<br>a minute where people have recurrent<br>seizures and there's a lot of people in<br>New Zealand with active epilepsy so<br>about 27,000 so that's all of the people<br>in this stadium we think about F alep C<br>we talk about sometimes people talk<br>about epilepsy as a disease or disorder<br>but it is and it's a group of disorders<br>so just like you can see on this slide<br>there's a lot of fruit there but it<br>doesn't take too much observation for<br>you to notice that actually there's<br>pears and bananas and apples and oranges<br>and so it's the same in epilepsy it's a<br>group of disorders and the disorders are<br>called epilepsy syndromes<br>so the epilepsy syndromes are defined<br>based on the age of onset of the<br>seizures the types of seizures that<br>people have what happens to their<br>cognitive development what we see on<br>their neurological exam and on their EEG<br>and on their imaging of their brain now<br>there are a lot of different epilepsy<br>syndromes and it's a spectrum you've got<br>the good epilepsies and the<br>very bad epilepsies and lots of things<br>in between but for the rest of this talk<br>I'm going to dichotomize them a little<br>bit artificially and I'm gonna talk<br>about the good epilepsies and the bad<br>epilepsies so a good epilepsies happen<br>in normal people who live normal lives<br>and they present with some seizures and<br>they take a pill and usually that stops<br>their epilepsy and often if they have<br>seizures starting in childhood they'll<br>outgrow them so that's all great but<br>even in people with good epilepsies<br>they're more likely to have problems<br>with learning they're more likely have<br>behavioral problems they're more likely<br>to end up with some mental health<br>disorders and in at least a third of<br>them we can't stop their seizures eat<br>with the drugs that we have available<br>most people have epilepsy is a lifelong<br>condition and then we have this really<br>horrible thing called sudo which is sun<br>and unexplained death and epilepsy<br>patients or people just don't wake up in<br>the morning and there's still a lot of<br>social stigma out there and<br>discrimination which result results in<br>reduced interaction less employment<br>particularly if you can't drive because<br>you're having seizures and that overall<br>ends up with a reduced quality of life<br>for some people with supposedly good<br>epilepsy so the good epilepsy sometimes<br>aren't that great but the bad epilepsies<br>are just terrible so the most severe<br>epilepsies are the developmental and<br>epileptic encephalopathies or the DES<br>and that's a relatively new term and<br>what we're talking about with an<br>epileptic encephalopathy is when you<br>have frequent seizures and inter inter<br>ictal so that's between seizures<br>electrical activity which results in a<br>negative impact on the developing brain<br>so you have cognitive and behavioral<br>impairments which above and beyond what<br>you would expect from the underlying<br>pathology and so the situation is you<br>have lovely with baby who's born and is<br>doing all the right things supposed to<br>do and then at some stage in the first<br>few years of their life they start<br>having seizures and then they might have<br>frequent seizures or very long seizures<br>and their EEG is very abnormal and these<br>two things impact negatively on their<br>development and they end up with<br>developmental slowing so they don't<br>progress like they should or they lose<br>skills and these developmental and<br>epileptic encephalopathies usually<br>present in childhood<br>not uncommon so five times more common<br>than childhood cancer about one in two<br>thousand births often end up with<br>intellectual disability and autism we<br>have a really hard time treating these<br>children and the mortality rate is high<br>and so it's because the good epilepsies<br>can sometimes be not that great and the<br>bad epilepsies are really bad that the<br>World Health Organization has declared<br>that epilepsy is the most common serious<br>brain disorder in the world so now that<br>everybody is I understand what we're<br>talking about and why it's important<br>that we do research and I'm going to<br>talk about the teams that I've been<br>lucky enough to be involved in so who<br>are the teams this is not my team this<br>is a Russian synchronized swimming team<br>and so but sports teams science teams<br>they all have some things in common they<br>all have a goal and it's usually winning<br>or scoring or finding answers and people<br>in the team all have a job to do and<br>everybody has to work together to do<br>that so in this particular instance the<br>job of this team apart from winning the<br>gold medal at the Olympics is they're<br>about to throw that girl miles into the<br>air and everybody has a place and a job<br>to do so some people have to hold her<br>still she has to do the flip other<br>people have to have the power and if it<br>I get it and they all do it together and<br>all works out well and then we get the<br>amazing whoa okay so I'm not talking<br>about sports teams now I'm talking about<br>science teams so the first sort of most<br>direct science team that I'm involved in<br>is the epilepsy research group here at<br>the University of Otago and our aim is<br>to improve the quality of life for<br>children with epilepsy and their<br>families and this is a picture of some<br>of the people in our team this is taken<br>last year so it's a little bit out of<br>date and got all the names of the<br>fantastic students and research<br>assistants and postdocs that have been<br>crucial to the success of our group and<br>to the outcomes that we have been able<br>to achieve now we we are a fundable<br>group but we play with lots of people<br>and so the<br>bigger group that we work with as Don<br>said is the University of Melbourne and<br>we have a lot to do them with them on a<br>very weekly basis we've had an hour and<br>a half of them on the teleconference<br>today and we go and see them over in<br>Melbourne at least a couple of times a<br>year and so this group is predominate<br>from the University of Melbourne and I<br>just like to specifically point out<br>Ingrid Scheffer laureate professor<br>Ingrid Scheffer who is a very very dear<br>friend and an amazing collaborator and<br>she has been instrumental in starting in<br>helping me she mentor she supervised my<br>PhD or my doctorate and she has been a<br>really strong mentor and collaborator<br>ever since there is also a lot of other<br>people in that group so we've got<br>Melanie Barlow who does her by and who<br>is a bio in petition at Bowie High<br>Joseph gets and Steve Petra who are<br>basic scientists or physiologist so they<br>look at cells and animals and Heather<br>washing Heather method who's at<br>University of Washington and she's a<br>geneticist and she you'll hear as I say<br>should we do a lot of work with her but<br>we're that's not enough people for our<br>team we have even bigger teams so we are<br>also all mold in these big American<br>teams so EPG PFP 4k and epi 25 these are<br>NIH that's National Institute of Health<br>us funded projects epi 25 is aiming to<br>sequence the genetic material of 25,000<br>people with epilepsy and as you can see<br>here this is from year one we're now up<br>to year for these are all the different<br>countries that are involved and all of<br>the participants in our research project<br>also participate to this big<br>collaboration now that's all the<br>scientists that I'm involved in but the<br>biggest most important part of or the<br>teams that I I'm lucky enough to have<br>anything have to have to do with is the<br>participants and the people that refer<br>these people these individuals to us so<br>we're really fortunate they've got a<br>fantastic group of pediatricians<br>pediatric neurologists and geneticists<br>around New Zealand that refer us<br>patients with epilepsy and we they refer<br>us individuals with epilepsy and<br>individuals of course come with families<br>some people that have epilepsy and some<br>people that don't and what we do so my<br>team and we recruit these people and<br>then we look at their notes and we<br>interview them and we look at videos we<br>look at all their investigations and we<br>phenotype them so phenotype is a sort of<br>a fancy word which basically means<br>finding all about all the clinical stuff<br>about these individuals and once we do<br>that we can then put them into groups of<br>like syndromes so that we can make<br>genetic discoveries from those groups<br>and we have over two thousand people<br>affected with epilepsy who are now part<br>of our FFC genetics research project<br>coming from all over New Zealand and I<br>am so this is just a few of those two<br>thousand some really happy girls sent me<br>some photos for this presentation and<br>here are a few of the boys and these<br>kids and their families don't as Don<br>said they don't just help with research<br>they help with everything they do take<br>they help with teaching they give videos<br>of their seizures and as Don said I was<br>lucky enough to be involved in the IAE<br>flagship educational project which was<br>epilepsy diagnosis org and this is it<br>was its the aim of it is to increase the<br>skill of people who help manage and<br>diagnose epilepsy so it's for health<br>workers all over the world it's a free<br>online resource and as Don said the<br>their seizures on here and you can go<br>and see videos and that was my job was<br>to get the video so lots of the videos<br>in this website are from people that are<br>in our research project so now let's<br>move on from teams and talk a bit about<br>genes so it wasn't that long ago what's<br>that 25 years ago<br>yeah um no more than that 35 years ago<br>well well we didn't really know very<br>much about what caused epilepsy so this<br>is a pie chart and you can see that the<br>big hunk of people unknown but now in<br>2019 at least in the developed world we<br>know that the vast majority of people<br>have epilepsy because of an abnormality<br>in their genetic code now if you are a<br>mother who's got trip these two<br>beautiful triplets and they have started<br>having seizures all at the same time and<br>their energy looks like this or you're<br>somebody who lives in this family and<br>everybody who has green has epilepsy you<br>don't need somebody<br>me to come along and say hey I think it<br>might be genetic because you probably<br>figured that out now but what does that<br>mean genetic okay so some of you in the<br>audience my husband one of them might<br>not know that much about genetics so<br>we're gonna give you I'm gonna give you<br>a little crash easy course<br>so hopefully you all remember that your<br>body is made up of lots and lots of<br>billions of cells and in those cells is<br>the genetic material of the genome and<br>we all that genetic material is<br>organized into chromosomes we all have<br>23 pairs of chromosomes it's a great<br>thing we have two copies of everything<br>and the chromosomes are made up of these<br>long strands of DNA and the DNA is made<br>up of nucleic acids and each of these<br>letters represents a different nucleic<br>acid and that is the code that we talk<br>about when we're talking about our<br>genetic code when you have lengths<br>certain lengths of the DNA code for<br>proteins and they're called genes so<br>genes called for proteins and proteins<br>are basically what makes you you and you<br>know we start off as a single cell and<br>in the first 40 weeks of your just when<br>you're still inside your mummys tummy it<br>that cell replicates over and over again<br>and then you get out and you keep<br>replicating over and over and over again<br>and so the genetic material and each<br>cell has to keep copying over and over<br>and over and how a lot more mistakes<br>aren't made is just incredible but<br>everyone so and how does it what do we<br>what happens well the DNA uncurls<br>and then our body is able to make a copy<br>of each side so that the strands are the<br>same and one goes to one cell and the<br>other goes the other cell but every once<br>in a while something goes wrong so<br>there's a change in the code now not<br>every change in the code is bad a lot of<br>changes in the code don't seem to make<br>any difference at all but some of those<br>changes we call pathogenic variants or<br>mutations and that and so what you see<br>here is the DNA is unwound and it's<br>copying and this is copied correctly<br>agreeing with the purple but this one<br>here should be a green in a purple too<br>but it's a red so that's an error okay<br>and so that is what we call a pathogenic<br>variant or a mutation and it leads to<br>abnormal protein and that add no<br>protein leads to a disease and we're<br>what we're talking about today is<br>epilepsy now it can be just a single<br>base these are called base pairs which<br>it has an abnormality or you can<br>actually end up with a whole hunk of<br>genes or parts of genes that can get<br>deleted or copied and we call those copy<br>number variations so epilepsy gene<br>discovery is relatively new thing and<br>the first discoveries were made in these<br>big families with lots of people with<br>epilepsy so everybody in blue has<br>epilepsy and what the researchers did<br>was they compared the genetic material<br>of the people who had epilepsy to the<br>genetic material the people that didn't<br>in the families to find out what was<br>different and this was a back in the day<br>when they did this they used a pretty<br>clunky genetic technology which was very<br>expensive and which took a lot of time<br>but it was successful and the first<br>with epilepsy or in the severe epilepsy<br>we usually have this situation where you<br>have one severely affected child and<br>nobody else that has epilepsy and it's<br>because of that that people prior to the<br>discovery of epilepsy genes people just<br>assumed that the problem was acquired<br>something happened there was a drug that<br>you took in the pregnancy or some virus<br>or something went wrong at the birth and<br>that this it was an acquired cause but<br>in around 2000 we realized that was not<br>the case in fact these were also genetic<br>epilepsies and it started with SC n 1a<br>so f c n 1a is the most important F alep<br>C gene so if you're I'm gonna show you<br>lots of genes today and they're just a<br>whole bunch of letters but SC n 1a is<br>the one to remember and so it was first<br>discovered in not in 2000 and it was<br>discovered in this family this was a<br>family Ingrid Shefford disc described<br>and everybody in this family who's<br>colored in has epilepsy but they have<br>mild epilepsy so they might have just<br>seizures with fever or seizures with<br>fever in the odd of a seizure and most<br>of these people outgrew their epilepsy<br>and so it was discovered that in this<br>family that the problem was a pathogenic<br>variant in the SCM 1a gene and so a<br>group of clever Belgium's<br>thought hmm what about dravet syndrome<br>now drowsy syndrome is not a good<br>epilepsy it's a bad epilepsy it's an<br>epileptic encephalopathy so what made<br>them think that that might be related<br>well this syndrome presents at roughly<br>the same age as the people on that<br>family it also presents with seizures<br>with fever and so they thought well<br>that's kind of similar maybe that's<br>important but that's about where it ends<br>in terms of the similarity for dravet<br>syndrome because the kids with Dravet<br>have frequent seizures and they have<br>long seizures I and they have lots of<br>different types of seizures and they may<br>start off with normal development what<br>usually but then they tend to go on to<br>end up with mild to severe intellectual<br>disability and that's because of the<br>encephalopathy the epileptic<br>encephalopathy their MRIs are normal and<br>they have generalized spike and we've on<br>EEG and what the Belgium's did is they<br>took a group of children with dravet<br>syndrome so these are individuals with<br>nobody else in the family so and they<br>looked for SCM 1a mutations and what<br>they found and what's been subsequently<br>found over and over is that dravet<br>syndrome is caused by genetic mutations<br>in SC n 1a in at least 90% and these are<br>mostly de novo what is de novo mean de<br>novo basically means it's not inherited<br>okay so it's still genetic but it's new<br>in the child so we have this situation<br>here child with severe epilepsy and<br>remember you've got two copies of<br>everything so this is the mutation and<br>then they've got one good copy okay and<br>everybody else has just got lots of good<br>copies so this is Jeannot de novo it's<br>new in the child so so Dias SC n 1a<br>codes for a protein which is on the in a<br>sodium channel in the brain and this is<br>oh nope it isn't go back so this is a<br>cartoon of that so this is a cell so you<br>can see here this is the cell and then<br>here's the cell membrane and this is<br>inside the cell and this is the sodium<br>channel and it's job is to help the<br>sodium ions come into the channel into<br>the cell and this is another picture of<br>the protein but not nearly as pretty but<br>this is inside the cell and this is<br>outside of the cell and each of these<br>different colored blocks here these<br>little squares and circles show<br>different places in the protein where<br>there's a mutation which is causing the<br>protein not to work very well and SCO<br>money is a very big gene as far as genes<br>go and but the vast majority of people<br>who have mutations they have their own<br>unique mutation so only about 18% of<br>people who have mutations in this gene<br>have the same one as somebody else so<br>everybody's got their own sort of unique<br>variation and what happens in the mild<br>epilepsy the big family as well as<br>Dravet is that the protein just doesn't<br>work very well and so you have a loss of<br>function so maybe you have two copies<br>one copy is doing its bit the other copy<br>isn't doing so good so you haven't got<br>enough now I was fortunate enough to<br>start into the world of epilepsy genetic<br>research around about the time when<br>molecular genetic advances were<br>occurring and these were amazing because<br>not only because they did things much<br>faster much better and much cheaper so<br>this has made a huge difference in terms<br>of our ability to do genetic discoveries<br>and so we in the New Zealand cohort we<br>use a variety of different molecular<br>techniques arrays targeted sequencing<br>whole exome sequencing and whole genome<br>sequencing I'm gonna explain that in a<br>minute<br>I'd to make our genetic discoveries so<br>the first one is the array okay so this<br>is a relatively pretty diagram but it's<br>a bit complicated basically what the<br>arrays do is they allow us to see not<br>the single so remember the DNA where the<br>mistake was made and and the Pearl and<br>the purple and the red or the red and<br>the green whatever it was so and I<br>talked about how big hunks of gene can<br>be missing or duplicated okay the arrays<br>help us pick up that that structural<br>variation and so we've had the method<br>the University of Washington she used<br>this technique on three hundred and<br>fifteen children from New Zealand and<br>Australia or New Zealand and Australia<br>cohort and she was able to demonstrate<br>that eight percent of kids their<br>epilepsy their severe epilepsy was<br>caused by de novo so knew not in the<br>parents big copy number variation and<br>this test is now standard for all<br>children who have any sort of an<br>epileptic encephalopathy so the next<br>molecular genetic advance that came<br>around which was great is next<br>generation parallel sequencing and this<br>again it's really it allows us to do<br>things really quick and what it does is<br>it sequences the genome and it can<br>sequence every single part of the genome<br>or it can just sequence the exons which<br>is the part that are important that<br>caught that code for proteins or you can<br>use different techniques to just and so<br>that can be of all of the genes or you<br>can just look at specific genes and so<br>the EPI 23 the epi 4k team used one of<br>these techniques whole exome sequencing<br>on trios and what that means is the<br>child and the parent to look for de novo<br>new changes in the child that we're not<br>in the pair<br>and they were able to show it's not just<br>dravet syndrome but all epileptic<br>encephalopathies a de novo pathogenic<br>variants are important in terms of the<br>cause have method uses Heather Heather<br>method yes<br>uses a different technique Molecular<br>inversion probes which is the targeted<br>sequencing so in this study what she did<br>with 519 of our kids from New Zealand in<br>Australia is she looked really hard at<br>64 genes that we thought might be<br>involved in epilepsy and this was a very<br>successful and resulted in these two<br>nature genetic papers which were<br>published in July in 2013 which<br>identified some new epilepsy genes so<br>I'm just going to talk a little bit<br>about grin 2a and the epilepsy a Phase<br>II a spectrum disorders<br>so the epilepsy a phase due spectrum is<br>a oh how to make sure I don't shine this<br>in somebody's eyes is a group of<br>epilepsies and so you can have the mild<br>ones which are at the top so normal<br>intellect may have a bit of language<br>problems and maybe the odd sees your EEG<br>is pretty good and then the<br>developmental and epileptics<br>encephalopathies at the bottom where<br>they have severe intellectual<br>disabilities seizures and language<br>problems and their EEG is just terrible<br>so when they fall asleep at night their<br>EGS is black it's got all this<br>electrical activity on it and so it was<br>this group of epileptic encephalopathies<br>that we found that the gene grin 2a was<br>responsible um and these are the<br>families in that paper that these<br>discoveries were made and so you might<br>notice though that these aren't de novo<br>so the individuals that were in the<br>paper or the individuals are originally<br>screened as part of the 519 were the<br>ones with the arrows and this family<br>here is a New Zealand family and you can<br>see that the mutation so everybody<br>that's colored has an epileptic a Phase<br>II syndrome and you can see that the<br>mutation M is it's what we call<br>segregates which means that it is in all<br>of the people that have the epilepsy<br>green hue encodes for a glutamate NMDA<br>receptor subunit on the one of them and<br>it's important because it is responsible<br>for excitation<br>the nerve cells so that's all very well<br>so that's just one of the genes and<br>that's that's all very well but it's not<br>just about finding the genes what's also<br>really important is once we identify a<br>gene we go back to the people who have<br>an abnormality in the gene and we find<br>out more about them because we want to<br>be able to say what is going to happen<br>to somebody who has a gene it has a<br>mutation in this gene and how can we<br>treat these people in the best way so<br>they have the best outcome so we go back<br>to the people who we've already<br>phenotyped and look at them in more<br>detail and try to figure out what kind<br>of epilepsies do they have whatever kind<br>of associated problems do they have how<br>can we treat that and so using this<br>methodology we with our other with all<br>of the teams that I showed you have been<br>really successful the New Zealand kids<br>have contributed to the discovery of<br>these new epaulets you know epilepsy<br>genes as well as delineate the phenotype<br>and more information about these other<br>ones now I can see you know those are<br>just a bunch of letters on a screen and<br>I'm not going to talk about all of them<br>so I'm gonna move some of these genes or<br>for the bad epilepsies and some of these<br>genes are for the good epilepsies um so<br>I'm going to now move to talk of sort of<br>a bigger picture and what we've kind of<br>learned about over the last 20 years in<br>terms of understanding and epilepsy<br>genetics so unfortunately it's not as<br>simple as you would like and what we<br>realize is it's not just one syndrome<br>it's caused by one gene and it's not one<br>gene causes one syndrome so you can have<br>a single team which can cause a mild<br>epilepsy in some people depending on the<br>variant and a really severe epilepsy in<br>the other and of course you can say to<br>me oh I know that because you've just<br>told me about SCM 1a and though we had<br>that mild family and they had the severe<br>epilepsy of dravet syndrome but it's<br>even more complicated than that because<br>SCM when a causes more types of<br>epileptic encephalopathy than just<br>dravet syndrome and so last year a few<br>years ago we published a new one's<br>called infantile early infantile SCM 1a<br>encephalopathy and so this type of<br>epilepsy is more severe than Dravet the<br>kids present earlier at three months of<br>age they have similar<br>types of seizures and their development<br>is normal to begin with but they have a<br>much poorer progression and they end up<br>profoundly disabled they're not able to<br>talk they're not able to walk and they<br>often can't feed themselves and they<br>have to have G tubes put in and then the<br>other really distinctive thing about<br>their phenotype is its movement disorder<br>and so here you can see three of those<br>boys and it's just that it's boys and<br>girls but some reason these three boys<br>and you can see that they're constantly<br>moving so this is this really pronounced<br>movement disorder that's associated with<br>this particular SEM on a phenotype and<br>the other thing remember I told you when<br>we looked at that picture of the gene<br>and we had all the different unique<br>variants on SCN 1a that everybody has<br>their own sort of own variant well in<br>this particular syndrome that's not the<br>case so we were able to show that almost<br>all of them had exactly the same<br>mutation and it was at a protein at the<br>2 to 6 area and that allowed our<br>colleagues our basic science colleagues<br>in Melbourne to look at that in much<br>more detail so they put that mutation<br>into frogs eggs and we also took some<br>skin biopsies so some skin from the<br>children that we had identified with<br>this syndrome they turned those skin<br>cells into nerve cells and they were<br>able to look and see what actually what<br>was what was what was going wrong in<br>those cells why did that mutation cause<br>a problem and what they found is unlike<br>the other types of SCM when a disorders<br>which caused a loss of function this<br>caused a gain of function and so<br>basically it's and that's why they were<br>such a more severe phenotype now that's<br>the one gene causes many syndromes but<br>one syndrome also can be caused by many<br>genes so the other syndrome here<br>epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal<br>seizures this is we've just published a<br>review of 130 cases and you can see that<br>no you can't unless I show you this but<br>you can see that seven cases were caused<br>by SCM 1a but there were 23 other<br>means that cause the same syndrome so it<br>is all very much more complicated than<br>we had really hoped but you're saying so<br>what does it matter all those letters on<br>a page how's that gonna help anybody<br>okay so it's all about clinical<br>translation how does it where is the<br>impact so we've got our little baby here<br>with a genetic abnormality in their<br>brain and ideally the situation we want<br>to be in and what we're definitely<br>moving towards is that somebody will<br>come in a baby will come in with<br>seizures and they'll have a blood test<br>and they will get a genetic diagnosis<br>now in some countries in the world that<br>does happen that they get a blood test<br>right away it doesn't happen here quite<br>yet but that is where we will move to<br>and a genetic diagnosis makes a<br>difference because it means that these<br>kids don't have to any have any more<br>investigations and these children with<br>severe efforts ease get a lot of<br>investigations trying to find the cause<br>because it's just awful these kids<br>having lots of seizures and people want<br>to know what's happened it also allows<br>us to a genetic diagnosis allows us to<br>be able to talk to the families and give<br>them a plan or an idea of what's going<br>to happen so if this is a benign<br>epilepsy or a good epilepsy where their<br>kids are gonna stop seizing and they're<br>going to go to school and do everything<br>that they their parents have planned for<br>them or whether they're actually going<br>to be difficult to treat and have a less<br>positive outcome and allows them to plan<br>and get organized and it also has an<br>impact a major cycle of social impact<br>because parents often feel really guilty<br>because remember we you know originally<br>people thought this was acquired they<br>think all I did something wrong or I<br>didn't do something right and and so<br>this helps remove that guilt and it also<br>allows them to hook up with other people<br>with families who have similar kids with<br>similar genetic disorders and get some<br>support and then of course remember<br>these are small children so these are<br>children in families who are wanting to<br>have more children and so they want to<br>have information and be able to make<br>informed genetic sort of reproductive<br>decisions and so we've been doing a lot<br>of work on that in the last few years<br>and we've been looking at something<br>called mosaicism so remember that the<br>epileptic encephalopathies are mostly de<br>novo diseases so mom dad two copies of a<br>gene<br>all normal baby bad epilepsy one bad<br>copy okay<br>and so these family here you would have<br>taken blood from all three of these<br>people you'd pick up the very inch in<br>this child and they you don't pick up a<br>very into the parents and they're told<br>that the recurrence risk is very low but<br>it's not nothing it's still there's<br>still a possibility and you're thinking<br>well how can that be and that is because<br>of this phenomenon now that's mosaicism<br>so in mosaicism you get so you've got<br>your egg and your sperm they get<br>together form a cell and the cell hasn't<br>got a mutation and then somewhere early<br>on you get an error and so what this<br>cells got a mutation these cells are all<br>good they all keep replicating so that<br>some of the cells have got mutations<br>some of them don't and you end up with<br>an individual who has got some cells<br>that have got a mutation in them and<br>some cells which don't so that's what<br>mosaicism is and this can be something<br>in the child so you can have a mosaic<br>child so here we go we've got mom dad no<br>problem first cells few cells and then<br>somewhere along here in the cells<br>let me turn around in this house that<br>are going to form the brain a mutation<br>happens and so the child's brain has<br>this mutation and they have bad epilepsy<br>and we and others have done some special<br>with Heather method have done some<br>really high what we call deep sequencing<br>which means we look in the blood but we<br>look really hard we sequence it over and<br>over and over again so we can pick up<br>really low levels of changes in<br>variation in the blood and we found that<br>in dravet syndrome that in kids who've<br>just had a normal blood test and have<br>been said that there is no abnormality<br>that if you do this really deep<br>sequencing in about ten percent of them<br>what actually happened is their mosaic<br>and it's mostly just in their brain and<br>not in the rest of them and this can<br>also happen in the parents so here we<br>have a mom or dad a very non<br>gender-specific cartoon and so it's some<br>stage early on in their in utero they<br>had a mutation and that ends up being<br>cells that are just in in their<br>reproductive system so they're all fine<br>this mutation perspective except for in<br>their gonads and so they can pass on<br>sperm and egg with the mutation even<br>though they don't have the disorder and<br>so last year we published in the New<br>England Journal of Medicine this paper<br>on that topic on parental mosaicism in<br>supposedly de novo epileptic<br>encephalopathies and what we did and<br>heather used this deep secret sequencing<br>technique on 120 trios so these are<br>children who were known to have a<br>mutation in a gene that causes epileptic<br>encephalopathy and their parents who<br>were felt to not have it based on the<br>standard sort of testing and so she we<br>did a very deep sequencing and of the<br>hundred and twenty ten of them we were<br>able to identify the same genetic<br>mutation in a parent that was in the<br>child so what that meant was that eight<br>point three percent of these supposedly<br>de novo families that the child didn't<br>inherit it the child did inherit it from<br>a mosaic parent and that's important for<br>genetic counseling because prior to<br>having that sort of testing done<br>everybody's just given this low risk but<br>it's not a no risk but when if you can<br>do this testing if you can pick up that<br>the child is is mosaic then there's no<br>way their parents can pass it on because<br>the mutation happened in the child okay<br>their mosaic if you can pick up that the<br>parent is mosaic then they've actually<br>got a really high risk of passing it on<br>to their child it's almost 1 in 50 it's<br>1 in to 50% and the ones in the middle<br>have a much much lower risk than we then<br>then previously but it can't be zero<br>because we don't we don't know that we<br>can always pick up in blood really low<br>levels of mosaicism so mosaicism has<br>been underappreciated both in parents<br>and in child and we now know that in<br>around about 10% or almost 10% of both<br>children or parents can be mosaic and<br>that's really important for Reproductive<br>counseling ok so now we're moving on to<br>the last part the dreams so one of our<br>dreams were dreaming of effective<br>treatments we're dreaming of good<br>outcomes or better outcomes and<br>ultimately we want to cure this too<br>order so the first thing is about<br>treatment now and we're definitely<br>making steps in the in the right<br>direction towards these dreams and so on<br>as a pediatric epileptologists I have a<br>lot of different antiepileptic<br>medications I can choose from when a<br>child comes in with seizures and it's<br>really to some extent it's often sort of<br>random which one you might choose so<br>it's what we know is that by identifying<br>the gene and making a genetic diagnosis<br>that directs the therapy in terms of<br>what drug is the best to tip to use and<br>so that the children will have less<br>seizures and if you have less seizures<br>then you have a better outcome and so<br>they're a study in Scotland this is an<br>amazing study in Scotland done by Joe<br>Simon Simon's and and they looked at<br>every single child in Scotland over<br>three years who had seizures just<br>presented with seizures they all got so<br>under three years of age new onset<br>seizures they all got genetic testing of<br>the known epilepsy genes and they found<br>were able to identify that in one third<br>of cases they could make a genetic<br>diagnosis and the most common gene that<br>they identified was a gene called prick<br>2 which we identified in 2012 and that's<br>a gene that is causes at very very mild<br>type of epilepsy where children have a<br>lot of seizures and but then they<br>outgrow it and they're absolutely fine<br>and then SCN 1a and if you looked at<br>just at the epileptic encephalopathy so<br>just the bad epilepsy is in that age<br>group they were able to show that half<br>of them could be diagnosed genetically<br>with one of the known epilepsy genes but<br>the best thing was they reported that<br>just having the diagnosis of the genetic<br>diagnosis had an impact on treatment so<br>that's just the sort of things that<br>you're going to choose in 76 percent of<br>them so even just so even finding the<br>diagnosis makes an impact on the drugs<br>that we already have and there's a lot<br>of examples of that but I'm just gonna<br>talk to you about one of them and that<br>is about PCT h19 so this is a gene which<br>causes girls clustering epilepsy it's<br>only in girls and I'm not gonna go into<br>that there is a cool other story but<br>it's bit long and so these kids present<br>at one year of age they have clusters of<br>seizures what I mean by that is they<br>have 5 10 15 20 30 seizures in a few<br>days to a week and then they'll go for<br>months with nothing ok and the seizures<br>impact negatively on their developments<br>they start off with normal development<br>but most of them end up with mild or to<br>severe ID and they often have problems<br>with behavior and autistic features and<br>it's caused by this gene PCH 19 which<br>encodes for a protein called pota Karen<br>19 which is responsible for helping<br>cells to stick together and what we have<br>been able to show or found is that this<br>particular type of epilepsy responds<br>really well to a drug that we have<br>available and that is Leavitt or asked<br>him and so um and we had discovered this<br>independently ingrid Scheffer with her<br>kids and me with mine so this is one of<br>my children that i looked after so she<br>started having seizures when she was one<br>these are clusters of seizures and this<br>is her age okay so and she had 12 to 18<br>clusters of seizures every year and had<br>to put this into perspective for 111<br>days in the first four years of her life<br>she had over 800 seizures and every time<br>she had a cluster she lost developmental<br>skills and I tried every anti epileptic<br>medication I had and then it was around<br>about the time of this new drug Leavitt<br>rash time came on the market so it was<br>just the the only thing I had left to<br>try so I tried and it was like a miracle<br>she just stopped seizing and it was<br>around about this same time that our<br>colleagues in Australia identified the<br>gene PTH 19 and because she and other<br>girls that I look at while all the kids<br>that I look after in that study they're<br>all screened for that and she ended up<br>we found out that she her epilepsy was<br>caused by variations in this gene and I<br>had four four other girls who also were<br>bad and had epilepsy caused by this gene<br>and here's a picture of two of their see<br>seizure histories and you can see<br>exactly the same thing as soon as I put<br>them on never trust him their seizures<br>stopped so we have reported<br>different cohorts there's a research<br>cohort of 17 girls where those are girls<br>who are in our study and another cohort<br>where parents are responding to a survey<br>and what we found is that between 59<br>31 and 59 percent of them have become<br>seizure free for at least 24 months on<br>Levitt racetam now - just to put that<br>into perspective in the trials of Levitt<br>racetam when it first came on the market<br>when they were giving it to people with<br>bad epilepsy<br>those are placebo controlled trials only<br>about 18% of people became seizure free<br>for 3 to 6 months this group of very<br>severe epilepsy almost 60% of becoming<br>seizure free for two years so it really<br>seems to be a specific drug to help<br>these kids and now finally what it's all<br>really about as we're trying to do<br>precision therapy so what we want to try<br>to do is find drugs that work just on<br>that specific gene not drugs that just<br>happen to work well in those cases and<br>there's a various ways that this is<br>happening and I'm not involved in this<br>research so I'm going to be telling you<br>about but you can't do this sort of<br>research unless you find the gene first<br>so we're gonna talk about precision<br>medicine and SCN 1a and the precision<br>medicine is something called ASOS<br>antisense oligonucleotides and these are<br>genetic pieces of genetic material that<br>can be made in the lab and what they do<br>is they attach to the gene and they can<br>either up regulate it or down regulate<br>it and so there are a few different<br>experiment types of epilepsy genes where<br>this is being tried but the one that's<br>the most far ahead is the SCM 1a and so<br>stok they're pute expres entered this<br>last year at the american Epilepsy<br>Society<br>they call their ASO tango and but<br>basically was a very crude diagram but<br>basically so this is SCM 1a this is the<br>good gene this is the bad gene and so<br>remember you got two copies it's a<br>loss-of-function so usually you get<br>about 50% of the protein but when you<br>add in their tango the a sa ASO it up<br>regulates the good gene so that it does<br>way more and that<br>compensates for the loss of the other<br>one and so you end up with 100% to the<br>protein so that's all very well looking<br>in a you know petri dish but does it<br>work well it hasn't been done in people<br>yet but it's amazing results in the mice<br>so now this is a little confusing so<br>this is a drive a mouse so what they do<br>is they take a mutation that we've<br>identified in children and they put it<br>into the mouse now so first of all let's<br>look at the normal mice so these are<br>normal mice that don't have any genetic<br>mutations and this is survival so 100%<br>survival zero and then this is how old<br>they are so birth up to nine months so<br>your black mouse here normal Mouse lives<br>along does everything that normal mice<br>are supposed to do all good okay<br>then they put this mutation into a mouse<br>and then that's called the drive a mouse<br>now the drive a mice do much worse than<br>the children and around about 20 days<br>they start seizing and they see the lot<br>and most of them die and the ones that<br>survive do very poorly but what happens<br>with the mice that they give the ASO in<br>ASO it is injected into the spinal fluid<br>it goes in it lasts one injection lasts<br>three months and what happened with the<br>mice that the driving mice that are<br>treated with the ASO is they don't seize<br>and they all live so it's practice a<br>remarkable it's basically just reversing<br>the phenotype to normal and the stokke<br>therapeutic are going to be starting<br>trials in adult patients with dravet<br>syndrome and next year so this is likely<br>to revolutionize some of these really<br>bad epilepsies asos are already being<br>used in neuromuscular disorders in<br>children in fact there you there and and<br>with remarkable results so we know this<br>technology will work and we just have to<br>be able to make it so that it we get a<br>SOS that are targeted at these<br>epilepsies so I've come to the end I<br>just wanted to thank my funders so HRC<br>has been very generous to me as as cure<br>kids have been fantastic tell Malik our<br>endowment fund and the estate of the<br>Ernest Haim and Davis and I've also been<br>really lucky to have some amazing<br>philanthropic donations which I've been<br>really very<br>for for and also I just like to say<br>another really big thank you to all of<br>the people and their families who have<br>been involved in our Pepsi genetic<br>research many of my patients you know I<br>feel like I've grown up with them and<br>it's already sad when I have to say<br>goodbye to send them to some adult<br>neurologist but they're in my program<br>forever so I can get come back to and so<br>a big big thank you to all of the people<br>who have made this research possible<br>thanks to thank for that for an<br>incredibly inspirational lecture she is<br>a very engaging speaker but I think more<br>importantly than the way that she<br>presents her research I hope everyone in<br>the room on the leave with the idea of<br>the incredible groundbreaking science on<br>that vennett is part of but perhaps more<br>importantly the implications of that<br>science for the lives of the patients<br>who are suffering from epilepsy so it<br>was a real sort of force with that as I<br>knew it would be you certainly deserve<br>the promotion because the final test we<br>won't be taking it away<br>and on behalf of the university I'd just<br>like to give you this very small token<br>that will allow you to remember this<br>night for the rest of your life</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
