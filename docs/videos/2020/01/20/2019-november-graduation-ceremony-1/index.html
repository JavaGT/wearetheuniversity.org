Nick Chamberlain to speak to<br>us today<br>gianna Coto de Caza no me he knew iki<br>oculto ki-10 a Chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor members of the council<br>members of the university proud parents<br>friends and family but most of all to<br>all of you the graduation class of 2019<br>congratulations I graduated 34 years ago<br>from that other medical school down the<br>road I know it's hard to believe but I<br>started University when I was seven<br>anyway I remember some things about the<br>day such as the parade up the Main<br>Street going out to dinner but or what I<br>definitely don't remember is the<br>graduation speech from the guest speaker<br>or who they were I guess I've got one<br>job and that's either to do a really<br>good job of this or to make it very<br>short I thought I'd talk about the three<br>hours the first is about being reliable<br>not that inspirational I know but I and<br>I don't just mean getting to work on<br>time every day<br>although there's nothing wrong with<br>getting to work on time is there being<br>reliable is defined as being<br>consistently good in quality or<br>performance if you're reliable you're<br>someone your team and colleagues can<br>depend upon someone who is honest<br>trustworthy hard-working strives for<br>excellence the motto of Auckland<br>University is in guineo it labora by<br>natural ability and hard work you've<br>proven both of these to have got this<br>far and by being reliable you'll get to<br>make a difference most of you will make<br>a difference or change or save many<br>lives during your career at least change<br>or save 10 after a few generations that<br>team will have become a million and<br>you'll have contributed significantly to<br>overpopulation and global warming<br>my wife is a real doctor and I often say<br>to her as she leaves work save some<br>lives and she always says back to me<br>save some money many of the lives you<br>save won't be dramatic it'll be a clever<br>diagnosis or a gut feeling like the<br>preemie baby of a pregnant mom that you<br>saved because she thought something was<br>wrong even though all the obsolescent to<br>your patients in pharr know they have<br>the most of the answers but you need to<br>do more than that you need to relate to<br>your patients and take time to connect<br>ask unscripted questions about their<br>lives thankfully you're going to get it<br>right most of the time but oops here<br>comes the fourth hour sometimes you'll<br>get it wrong at the beginning of this<br>year I told our Northland Picaro our<br>fifth year students and training in<br>Tunes don't be afraid to fail or make<br>mistakes however I'm also here to tell<br>you that though you should not fear<br>failure you should do your very best to<br>avoid it Nietzsche famously said<br>whatever doesn't kill you makes you<br>stronger but what he failed to stress is<br>that it almost kills you that<br>gut-wrenching feeling is awful and for<br>driven successful people like yourselves<br>it's disorienting but it also is how you<br>learn some of your greatest lessons<br>including humility part of humility is<br>recognising the power of working in a<br>team that you can't always do all that<br>others want you to and you'll be able to<br>do something they will be able to do<br>some things better than you<br>it means valuing everyone no matter what<br>their role I'm wrapped to be doing a job<br>I love as chief executive of Northland e<br>HB make sure you're wrapped with your<br>career choices I've done a number of<br>interesting things which you've heard<br>about and I've also had a few<br>interesting health challenges including<br>TB dengue fever and prostate cancer the<br>breadth of my work and life experiences<br>do help ensure but don't guarantee I've<br>become a bit more rounded but I hope you<br>get to achieve that without some of<br>those personal health challenges don't<br>be scared of reinventing yourself<br>sometimes during your work life what<br>floats your boat now may not in 15 or 20<br>years<br>that's the beauty of health there are so<br>many options change is the one constant<br>so at the very least even if you don't<br>reinvent what you do make sure you're<br>open to change and regularly reinvent<br>how you do it reflecting on the best<br>things I've achieved over the years they<br>were when I put myself out there took a<br>risk respectfully challenge the status<br>quo and use data and science to back me<br>up often it has required many attempts<br>to achieve the required change so be<br>prepared to be relentless the career you<br>have chosen requires you all to lead<br>from your very first day of work this<br>may seem a little odd when you just<br>qualified graduated and many of you are<br>about to start jobs in a hierarchy where<br>you may feel like you're on the bottom<br>rung of a pretty high level look who's<br>up on the stage look at our gowns<br>however no one in this room is any more<br>important than anyone else everyone can<br>make a difference no matter who you are<br>or what you do Margaret Mead wrote never<br>doubt that a small group of thoughtful<br>committed citizens can change the world<br>indeed it's the only thing that ever has<br>greater than' Berg's crusade against<br>climate change is a classic example of<br>how to lead when you're not in charge<br>you may have heard this famous quote<br>which was incorrectly attributed to<br>Nelson Mandela our deepest fear is not<br>that we are inadequate our deepest fear<br>is that we are powerful beyond measure<br>it is our light not our darkness that<br>most frightens us we ask ourselves Who<br>am I to be brilliant gorgeous talented<br>fabulous actually who are you not to be<br>you're a child of God your playing small<br>does not serve the world there is<br>nothing enlightened about shrinking so<br>that other people won't feel insecure<br>around you we're all meant to shine as<br>children do and as we let our own light<br>shine we unconsciously give other people<br>permission to do the same as we're<br>liberated from our fear our presence<br>automatically liberates<br>of us so shine be radiant the thing<br>about gritter and most good leaders are<br>that they're real and authentic<br>authenticity is part of being yourself<br>and being real but also living a life<br>with purpose such as saving the planet<br>from us old farts and letting that<br>purpose and light shone through we're<br>privileged working in health<br>be thankful that is try and have the<br>mindset we get to rather than we've got<br>to the problem with privilege is that it<br>can blind sometimes you've got to push<br>it aside to see clearly the inequities<br>we see in health or our greatest<br>population health challenge get<br>righteous about them they're unfair and<br>unjust and all of us have the power to<br>change them speak out or speak up when<br>you see something you believe is wrong<br>whether it's about an equity<br>institutional racism or a clinical<br>decision address issues with courage and<br>gentleness<br>but don't just let them happen without<br>asking the question or letting someone<br>you know believe that someone know you<br>believe it's wrong despite the privilege<br>medicine and health care can be tough<br>and you need to be resilient you'll be<br>tired and overworked at times encounter<br>people who don't see things your way<br>teammates and colleagues who are<br>stressed bosses may not be as courteous<br>as they should be this is where that<br>resilience comes in it's about learning<br>from mistakes or tough times brushing it<br>off and moving on finally be ridiculous<br>sometimes humor is essential and<br>laughter honestly is the best medicine<br>so don't forget to laugh so I hope you<br>got my three hours they were actually 15<br>of them so let's call them my 15<br>commandments be reliable be relatable be<br>right occasionally be wrong be repped be<br>rounded reinvent be reflective<br>respectful and relentless be radiant and<br>real be righteous resilient and<br>ridiculous and always remember<br>yeah T maraenui

the babies are born<br>dangerously small she identified that a<br>population of stem cells called site<br>population trophoblasts are depleted in<br>the percentage of babies that are born<br>dangerously small the lack of these<br>cells in the placenta could explain why<br>some fetuses don't grow properly in the<br>uterus<br>mark Richard Hobbs in Pediatrics mark<br>investigated
