Julius lark thank<br>you so much the nursing has hard work so<br>I'm not going to sugarcoat it because it<br>is it's not glamorous as some of the TV<br>shows that we watch on TV there's no new<br>doctor in the London cupboards<br>because they've really you know put them<br>down to size and you've got a swipe to<br>get in these days our population needs<br>are changing it's challenging our<br>population is aging in chronic long-term<br>conditions are increasing nurses are on<br>the front lines of health care and small<br>clinics and large hospitals in the rural<br>areas our jobs are tough<br>however as nurses we will hold your hand<br>when we need to and when you want to we<br>offer a voice of calm or we give that<br>knowing glance that says things are<br>going to be okay and I don't mean us<br>some more than a glance like The Rock<br>does as nice as we expected to care more<br>about our patients than we do for<br>ourselves we may feel as if we've<br>inconvenienced every day that we go to<br>work we may feel an expectation that we<br>go above and beyond for our patients and<br>your families inferno at the expense of<br>our own our days can be stressful and<br>exhausting and sometimes thankless but<br>through long shifts and night not late<br>nights and the heat at workplaces and<br>yet in those quiet acts of humanity we<br>are saving lives we are offering solace<br>this is evident now in what is happening<br>in my home country and someone with the<br>measles epidemic so I would like to<br>think and not an acknowledge all the<br>nurses that are there and our other<br>health care professionals that are<br>helping my people in the come in our<br>country thank you so much and we are so<br>awesome that the WHI World Health<br>Organization has dedicated 2020 as the<br>International Year of the news did you<br>know that<br>oh my gosh really something to celebrate<br>for next year the context of Nursing<br>Practice is also changing with new<br>technologies that is impacting the<br>healthcare industry and how we work for<br>example portable devices apps electronic<br>health records telehealth but remember<br>underneath all that technology is our<br>patient therefore we have to ensure we<br>have the right balance between<br>technology and human nuances that make<br>nursing what it is it's about caring and<br>compassion and being kind increasing<br>immigration has lead to greater<br>diversity of our patients our staff and<br>all health settings requiring nurses to<br>ensure the practice is underpinned by<br>cultural safety so I was asked to just<br>briefly give a just have a little story<br>about my journey as the Chancellor had<br>said I was born in Sawa in a small<br>village called suffer to earth it's my<br>full name but I used the last three<br>liters and so I was named after that<br>village and then growing I thought who<br>so and as I'm growing up I've learnt the<br>significance of what my name means to me<br>and what it means to everyone that is in<br>my village a few years ago when I took<br>my children to some more I took them<br>around to my village and in the villages<br>he had this great big sign with Ezra the<br>village name on it so this my children<br>saw four children they saw my name<br>blazoned across the some you know in the<br>sign outside the village so then when<br>they saw it they said oh my gosh mom<br>they've named a village after you I'm<br>not going to tell them any difference so<br>my family migrated when I was really<br>little baby one year old<br>we went from paradise of 32 degrees to<br>Dunedin with lots of sheep lots of sheep<br>and lots more sheep and snow and of<br>course the Highlanders so I've done all<br>my schooling there and I've always<br>wanted to be a news I was always under<br>need in hospital for grommet operations<br>I mean from Dunedin to what I thought<br>was the Big Smoke which was Christchurch<br>to study nursing there at Christchurch<br>politic I graduated the year in nineteen<br>and in with the Aaron until 1993 and<br>then I moved to Auckland because I<br>thought I want to know I want to work<br>more with Pacific people where are they<br>someone said you need to move to<br>Auckland in say I moved here in terms of<br>my journey I've been at what we've one<br>of our friends is coined as an<br>accidental tourist to where I am today<br>I haven't have a pathway a purposeful<br>pathway to get to where I am today<br>it was simply being in the right place<br>at the right time and having really good<br>friends behind you that saw the<br>potential and me that I didn't see in<br>myself I have held a few senior news<br>roles both in Counties Manukau and also<br>Auckland DHB and on reflection of my<br>journey I have wooden Neel I did not<br>think there I would be in the roles that<br>I am today or even having the privilege<br>to stand in front of you and hoping to<br>give some kind of inspiration to you and<br>why did I think that I wouldn't be here<br>in these roles because I keep forgetting<br>like I said to my chief from you start<br>to Cheney power who is here to support<br>me thank you Jeannie<br>and it was so my sister Sierra I keep<br>forgetting that I failed state exams the<br>first time now that doesn't mean you<br>guys do it you know you just do as I say<br>not as I do but because I was too pers<br>instead of studying finish mean<br>physiology books I was studying those<br>and Boone you guys might be a little bit<br>young but um I think they're ordered and<br>the generation would know and I almost<br>however failing is part of learning and<br>it is of success I'm a single parent of<br>four children juggling and balancing<br>homework and study and I'm still<br>studying there's nothing we're learning<br>every single day and this is something<br>that I pass on to my nurses it it<br>counties is that we can't we need to<br>continuously develop ourselves<br>it wasn't easy however I had excellent<br>in really supportive families and<br>friends to get me through and I would<br>not be here today if it was not for them<br>so I do acknowledge them all however it<br>has brought up my own resilience in my<br>strength of character I acknowledge that<br>some of you have gone through many<br>hardships yourselves and maybe still<br>going through these hardships<br>how we believe these inspire you and<br>make you more hungry to be successful<br>and to be stronger and I'm prove I'm<br>living proof of that last week I met<br>with a Minister of Health honourable<br>David Clarke as part of my role as<br>loosing on council chair when you meet<br>with the Minister of Health so I meet<br>with them last Wednesday just to brief<br>them on current news and council<br>projects and using trends the hot topic<br>at the moment is the nursing workforce<br>and the workforce of the future and the<br>need for a strong workforce strategy to<br>grow our own so you are the future and<br>we need to help you get into jobs here<br>in Auckland in New Zealand so I'm<br>putting out a call to all the chief<br>nurses in New Zealand that we need to be<br>employing all our new graduates and I'm<br>sure they'll hearing me right now so as<br>you begin your journey into the nursing<br>professional space I encourage you to<br>always look for ways to make a<br>difference by bringing your own unique<br>identity and perspective to the work you<br>do both in your workplace and out in the<br>community stand strong in your space of<br>authority as losers and miss leaders<br>take us deep into the unknown get<br>uncomfortable if you're comfortable<br>you're not growing so seek to become<br>uncomfortable I can see a lot of

life and well-being in<br>developing a deep sense of care and<br>respect for the sanctity of life in all<br>its stages promoting inclusiveness and<br>equality of access and opportunity and<br>as custodians we need to have the<br>courage to exercise a prophetic stance<br>for the most vulnerable and for those<br>without hope caring is fundamental to<br>humanity it is part of being human and<br>it has no cultural social or economic<br>boundaries as a final note Thank You<br>Chancellor and your team thank you to<br>the University of Auckland for producing<br>our fine future generation
