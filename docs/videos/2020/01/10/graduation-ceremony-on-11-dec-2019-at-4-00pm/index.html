koutou<br>katoa<br>good afternoon Chancellor<br>vice-chancellor members of the council<br>colleagues graduates and Farnell it's an<br>absolute pleasure to be here speaking to<br>you this afternoon and my special and<br>heartfelt congratulations to the<br>graduates who can be immensely proud of<br>their achievements as I can see your<br>friends and family are when I came to<br>Otago in 1992 around 15 to 20 percent of<br>school leader levers attended University<br>this was a large increase from previous<br>generations like me many of my friends<br>were the first and their family to<br>attend University the government in the<br>late 80s and early 90s wanted to<br>increase participation of New Zealanders<br>and tertiary education although in order<br>to do that they needed to have some<br>funding provided by the individual and<br>hence the introduction of student loans<br>which could be a whole new topic in<br>itself however at least two-thirds of<br>your education is still provided by the<br>New Zealand taxpayer and today around<br>1/3 of school leavers get a university<br>education so why did the government make<br>these changes to allow more school<br>leavers to undertake further education<br>the investment was to ensure New Zealand<br>grew the skill set of the population to<br>contribute to the economy and other<br>challenges facing our communities Otago<br>is not just a leading university<br>nationally it's also on the top one<br>percent of universities worldwide the<br>education you have received over the<br>last few years is truly of international<br>standards at Otago you've been taught by<br>some of the world leaders in their<br>subject areas people that could work<br>anywhere in the world but choose to be a<br>Tartar NGO dedicated to teaching all of<br>you I know from my own experience of<br>working at different universities and<br>institutions around the world that our<br>target graduates are as well trained<br>those from any top institution when you<br>came to Otago you would have seen the<br>marketing slogan telling you to take<br>your place in the world as you're now<br>preparing to do this what is going to<br>make you successful in your chosen<br>career paths what qualities have you<br>developed during the studies that can<br>contribute back to New Zealand what is<br>unique to a notar go graduate I've been<br>reflecting on this as I look back over<br>23 years ago to where I was sitting<br>where you are now of course you've all<br>gained academic knowledge and your<br>chosen discipline however don't think<br>you're not as good as someone else<br>because you didn't achieve as highly<br>academically the workforce wants someone<br>who has both academic knowledge as well<br>as a whole set of other skills so what<br>are the wider skills there you have<br>gained over the last few years I don't<br>need to tell you that one of these<br>skills requires you to work hard it's<br>clear that you've done this already and<br>you were seeing your hard work being<br>celebrated today you also need to have<br>good social skills and be able to work<br>in teams Otago excels in providing<br>opportunities for developing these and<br>my experience is that students have<br>never been too shy and social<br>participation<br>we're the only truly residential<br>University in New Zealand with most<br>students living at some point in<br>colleges or flats around the campus you<br>socialize together play sports together<br>even sometimes study together you learn<br>to form and maintain meaningful<br>relationships friendships that will last<br>a lifetime at the start of the ceremony<br>professor Broughton quoted the merry<br>proverb which ends with hurtin gotta<br>hate Anita hate anger tear it is people<br>it is people it is people relationships<br>are not only incredibly important for<br>learning but also in the work<br>environment you need to be flexible in<br>the way you approach things and you also<br>need to be able to embrace change and<br>adapt to new environments when I first<br>started school a tattoo teacher country<br>school<br>45 minutes from the nearest town there<br>are only 30 kids in the whole school<br>the teachers had to put on the boiler in<br>the morning to heat their classrooms up<br>then do the bus run to pick up the kids<br>and that was before even thinking of<br>undertaking any teaching I bet they<br>hadn't been trained for that at Teachers<br>College even the kids helped out with<br>chores the best and most coveted job was<br>for the forum - or year eight boys who<br>used to take tunes on a Friday afternoon<br>driving the school bus to the local farm<br>to fill it up with diesel of course most<br>of them have been driving a tractor for<br>a few years by that age but I'm sure<br>this experience is no longer afforded to<br>our younger generation my family didn't<br>shift it to twice all at a time when the<br>dams projects were at their height I<br>went from a primary school of 30 kids to<br>a school of over a thousand this was<br>quite a culture shock as there are<br>multiple classes for each year level and<br>the town kids had different priorities -<br>country kids again I had to learn to be<br>flexible embraced change and fit on to<br>different learning environments these<br>skills were also required to transition<br>to high school and eventually to<br>university these are also skills<br>required by employers and if in any job<br>there will be challenges changes in<br>direction new teams to work with or new<br>technology to learn over the years I<br>haven't done too badly somewhat up to<br>say I've achieved fairly well I've<br>always tried to take opportunities that<br>have come up I'd describe myself as a<br>calculated risk taker who's not afraid<br>to give things a go even if it might not<br>work out I've also tried to take a path<br>that appealed to me the most rather than<br>something that a path that people<br>expected me to take that's not to say<br>that I've always - chosen the best path<br>or a path that's always led to success<br>I've also had fantastic mentors and that<br>brings me to my next point<br>feedback the breakfast of champions be<br>receptive<br>to feedback being receptive is a very<br>important skill<br>I'm sure you've always all experienced<br>the sharp end of this but how many of<br>you have really taken it on board as a<br>positive thing rather than thinking that<br>someone is being critical I've always<br>been open to feedback that's not to say<br>I've always liked the feedback that I've<br>received<br>but I've always listened to people much<br>wiser than myself and appreciated when<br>they've taken time to help me because<br>that's what feedback is helped it's<br>helped me not to waste time on problems<br>that have already been solved but to<br>focus on solving new things it's helped<br>me to get back on track if I've gone<br>down a path that isn't so useful it's<br>helped me to focus on areas that I've<br>needed to develop this has really<br>enabled me to grow my skills and move<br>into challenging roles at quite a young<br>age whatever you choose to do do<br>something you're passionate about and be<br>open to feedback use it to try and<br>always improve your skill set you also<br>need to be optimistic and look for the<br>good and people and be supportive of<br>your colleagues never judge someone by<br>what you initially see I've taught at<br>this university for a number of years<br>and there are always students that you<br>remember for one reason or another many<br>of you like us sitting in this audience<br>who have experienced hardship maybe<br>faith failure or even a sense of not<br>achieving as well as you might have<br>wished once a student came to our<br>department wanted to take one of our<br>papers the students record was to put it<br>politely very maxed a range of papers<br>that have been passed just passed and<br>failed the student was adamant they<br>wanted to study pathology but they<br>acknowledged their academic progress<br>didn't necessarily support the study<br>option I asked the student to explain<br>some of the factors that have impacted<br>on their study it turned out their<br>mother had died in their first year<br>following this they were diagnosed with<br>a chronic illness would have which had<br>had them hospitalized multiple times<br>over 18 months<br>and then a clothespin brand parent had<br>passed away in their second year of<br>course these things weren't listed on<br>their academic record and quite frankly<br>I was amazed that they had passed any<br>papers at all given their circumstances<br>and how many how much time that they'd<br>had out of their studies it turns out<br>the student did amazingly well when they<br>didn't have negative influences<br>affecting them and they flourished when<br>they had people around them believing in<br>them they graduated with a science<br>degree and now they run their own<br>business I still sometimes think of this<br>student and admire their resilience<br>their perseverance and their tenacity to<br>keep going when things were tough<br>finally you need to use your skills of<br>critical analysis to determine fact from<br>fiction particularly at a time when<br>we're at risk of alternate effects being<br>seen as real where many people believe<br>anything they read on social media where<br>science has not believed even when there<br>is overwhelming evidence so what does<br>the future look like for you as<br>graduates 95% of otago graduates go on<br>to get jobs or undertake further study<br>it's predicted that someone graduating<br>in 2019 will have several different<br>careers over their lifetime it's even<br>been described as people becoming<br>itinerant workers by their I don't want<br>to insinuate that you'll end up on the<br>dole but you're likely work in areas for<br>a few years before taking a break to<br>retrain in a different field there will<br>be many new jobs created others will<br>disappear many jobs will be taken over<br>by artificial intelligence so you need<br>to be thinking about the skills that you<br>as an educated human can bring to a role<br>critical complex thinking and<br>problem-solving social skills teamwork<br>and the ability to learn new skills<br>these are all essential and linked to<br>success in the workplace all things that<br>you've experienced during your time at<br>Otago so I challenge you to be a<br>lifelong learner to think about the<br>wider skill set that you need to be<br>successful<br>all contribute back to the New Zealand<br>society that's invested in you I wish<br>you all the very best for the future it<br>looks
