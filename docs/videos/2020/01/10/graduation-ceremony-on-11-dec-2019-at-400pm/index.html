good afternoon Chancellor
vice-chancellor members of the council
colleagues graduates and Farnell it's an
absolute pleasure to be here speaking to
you this afternoon and my special and
heartfelt congratulations to the
graduates who can be immensely proud of
their achievements as I can see your
friends and family are when I came to
Otago in 1992 around 15 to 20 percent of
school leader levers attended University
this was a large increase from previous
generations like me many of my friends
were the first and their family to
attend University the government in the
late 80s and early 90s wanted to
increase participation of New Zealanders
and tertiary education although in order
to do that they needed to have some
funding provided by the individual and
hence the introduction of student loans
which could be a whole new topic in
itself however at least two-thirds of
your education is still provided by the
New Zealand taxpayer and today around
1/3 of school leavers get a university
education so why did the government make
these changes to allow more school
leavers to undertake further education
the investment was to ensure New Zealand
grew the skill set of the population to
contribute to the economy and other
challenges facing our communities Otago
is not just a leading university
nationally it's also on the top one
percent of universities worldwide the
education you have received over the
last few years is truly of international
standards at Otago you've been taught by
some of the world leaders in their
subject areas people that could work
anywhere in the world but choose to be a
Tartar NGO dedicated to teaching all of
you I know from my own experience of
working at different universities and
institutions around the world that our
target graduates are as well trained
those from any top institution when you
came to Otago you would have seen the
marketing slogan telling you to take
your place in the world as you're now
preparing to do this what is going to
make you successful in your chosen
career paths what qualities have you
developed during the studies that can
contribute back to New Zealand what is
unique to a notar go graduate I've been
reflecting on this as I look back over
23 years ago to where I was sitting
where you are now of course you've all
gained academic knowledge and your
chosen discipline however don't think
you're not as good as someone else
because you didn't achieve as highly
academically the workforce wants someone
who has both academic knowledge as well
as a whole set of other skills so what
are the wider skills there you have
gained over the last few years I don't
need to tell you that one of these
skills requires you to work hard it's
clear that you've done this already and
you were seeing your hard work being
celebrated today you also need to have
good social skills and be able to work
in teams Otago excels in providing
opportunities for developing these and
my experience is that students have
never been too shy and social
participation
we're the only truly residential
University in New Zealand with most
students living at some point in
colleges or flats around the campus you
socialize together play sports together
even sometimes study together you learn
to form and maintain meaningful
relationships friendships that will last
a lifetime at the start of the ceremony
professor Broughton quoted the merry
proverb which ends with hurtin gotta
hate Anita hate anger tear it is people
it is people it is people relationships
are not only incredibly important for
learning but also in the work
environment you need to be flexible in
the way you approach things and you also
need to be able to embrace change and
adapt to new environments when I first
started school a tattoo teacher country
school
45 minutes from the nearest town there
are only 30 kids in the whole school
the teachers had to put on the boiler in
the morning to heat their classrooms up
then do the bus run to pick up the kids
and that was before even thinking of
undertaking any teaching I bet they
hadn't been trained for that at Teachers
College even the kids helped out with
chores the best and most coveted job was
for the forum - or year eight boys who
used to take tunes on a Friday afternoon
driving the school bus to the local farm
to fill it up with diesel of course most
of them have been driving a tractor for
a few years by that age but I'm sure
this experience is no longer afforded to
our younger generation my family didn't
shift it to twice all at a time when the
dams projects were at their height I
went from a primary school of 30 kids to
a school of over a thousand this was
quite a culture shock as there are
multiple classes for each year level and
the town kids had different priorities -
country kids again I had to learn to be
flexible embraced change and fit on to
different learning environments these
skills were also required to transition
to high school and eventually to
university these are also skills
required by employers and if in any job
there will be challenges changes in
direction new teams to work with or new
technology to learn over the years I
haven't done too badly somewhat up to
say I've achieved fairly well I've
always tried to take opportunities that
have come up I'd describe myself as a
calculated risk taker who's not afraid
to give things a go even if it might not
work out I've also tried to take a path
that appealed to me the most rather than
something that a path that people
expected me to take that's not to say
that I've always - chosen the best path
or a path that's always led to success
I've also had fantastic mentors and that
brings me to my next point
feedback the breakfast of champions be
receptive
to feedback being receptive is a very
important skill
I'm sure you've always all experienced
the sharp end of this but how many of
you have really taken it on board as a
positive thing rather than thinking that
someone is being critical I've always
been open to feedback that's not to say
I've always liked the feedback that I've
received
but I've always listened to people much
wiser than myself and appreciated when
they've taken time to help me because
that's what feedback is helped it's
helped me not to waste time on problems
that have already been solved but to
focus on solving new things it's helped
me to get back on track if I've gone
down a path that isn't so useful it's
helped me to focus on areas that I've
needed to develop this has really
enabled me to grow my skills and move
into challenging roles at quite a young
age whatever you choose to do do
something you're passionate about and be
open to feedback use it to try and
always improve your skill set you also
need to be optimistic and look for the
good and people and be supportive of
your colleagues never judge someone by
what you initially see I've taught at
this university for a number of years
and there are always students that you
remember for one reason or another many
of you like us sitting in this audience
who have experienced hardship maybe
faith failure or even a sense of not
achieving as well as you might have
wished once a student came to our
department wanted to take one of our
papers the students record was to put it
politely very maxed a range of papers
that have been passed just passed and
failed the student was adamant they
wanted to study pathology but they
acknowledged their academic progress
didn't necessarily support the study
option I asked the student to explain
some of the factors that have impacted
on their study it turned out their
mother had died in their first year
following this they were diagnosed with
a chronic illness would have which had
had them hospitalized multiple times
over 18 months
and then a clothespin brand parent had
passed away in their second year of
course these things weren't listed on
their academic record and quite frankly
I was amazed that they had passed any
papers at all given their circumstances
and how many how much time that they'd
had out of their studies it turns out
the student did amazingly well when they
didn't have negative influences
affecting them and they flourished when
they had people around them believing in
them they graduated with a science
degree and now they run their own
business I still sometimes think of this
student and admire their resilience
their perseverance and their tenacity to
keep going when things were tough
finally you need to use your skills of
critical analysis to determine fact from
fiction particularly at a time when
we're at risk of alternate effects being
seen as real where many people believe
anything they read on social media where
science has not believed even when there
is overwhelming evidence so what does
the future look like for you as
graduates 95% of otago graduates go on
to get jobs or undertake further study
it's predicted that someone graduating
in 2019 will have several different
careers over their lifetime it's even
been described as people becoming
itinerant workers by their I don't want
to insinuate that you'll end up on the
dole but you're likely work in areas for
a few years before taking a break to
retrain in a different field there will
be many new jobs created others will
disappear many jobs will be taken over
by artificial intelligence so you need
to be thinking about the skills that you
as an educated human can bring to a role
critical complex thinking and
problem-solving social skills teamwork
and the ability to learn new skills
these are all essential and linked to
success in the workplace all things that
you've experienced during your time at
Otago so I challenge you to be a
lifelong learner to think about the
wider skill set that you need to be
successful
all contribute back to the New Zealand
society that's invested in you I wish
you all the very best for the future it
looks bright and it's time to take your
thank you very much professor young for
your thoughtful and engaging address
this afternoon I'm confident that your
message touching on optimism flexibility
and critical thinking would have
resonated with our graduate graduates
today in early 2020 professor Jung will
take up a new role heading the school of
Medical Sciences at the University of
Sydney professor young we thank you for
your sterling service to our University
and wish you all the best in your new
position I invite you now to join me
again in thanking professor young for
her fine graduation
on behalf of the University Council I
thank you again for sharing in the
celebration particularly those of you
who have travelled long distances to be
here I wish you a safe journey home I
also wish to thank the vice-chancellor
professor Haines and our academic and
professional staff at all of the
universities campuses throughout New
Zealand for their outstanding
contribution to ensuring our students
benefit from the immense a pedra power
of an excellent university education I
invite you all to join with me in
expressing appreciation to our staff
to you who have graduated or receive
diplomas I offer the congratulations of
the University on your new status and I
welcome you to its full and permanent
membership I charge you by the common
bond that now unites us hints forth to
cherish the good name and reputation of
the University and to strive for the
advancement of knowledge and the
extension of understanding I trust that
in your different vocations your lives
may be fruitful of good to yourselves
and to those among whom you live the
academic anthem Guardi armas will now be
sung the words are printed inside the
back cover of the graduation booklet
please stand for the anthem and remain
