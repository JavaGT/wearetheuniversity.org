class act first I want to express<br>my very sincere gratitude and<br>appreciation for the honor you have just<br>invested in me today it is a very very<br>special occasion in my life which I'll<br>always treasure with pride and also with<br>humility these things do not happen on<br>their own and of course my wife Wendy<br>and my children who are here today which<br>is really very special they've had her<br>put up with the hours I've spent<br>meetings overseas or here in New Zealand<br>their support made their realizing my<br>passion possible thank you it's also a<br>very special occasion for me to be given<br>the opportunity to address the Graduate<br>for the Faculty of pharmacy and<br>dentistry in the medical laboratory<br>sciences my early background was in<br>pharmacy I lived by Breeze pharmacy<br>because my father was a pharmacist with<br>great commitment he was dedicated to<br>ensuring that pharmacy education was<br>relevant to the needs of the health<br>service and that pharmacists were fully<br>equipped not only to run a business but<br>also to meet the demands that the role<br>of a health professional required for<br>the future to this end he worked<br>tirelessly in the area of pharmacy<br>education and as one of the early<br>initiators leading to the establishment<br>of a pharmacy school in Lower Hutt how<br>amazed he would be see he would be today<br>to see the standards which pharmacy<br>school here in Otago has achieved his<br>level of excellence and the professional<br>achievement that is graduates you the<br>graduates have demonstrated within it of<br>course it goes without saying that I<br>have immense pride and respect for my<br>own dental faculty the Faculty of the<br>industry in whose affliction I have<br>bathed in all over the world you know it<br>also enjoys a state-of-the-art new<br>building with state-of-the-art teaching<br>technology in Auckland we have the<br>extension of the attacker faculty<br>I must congratulate the Dean and Peter<br>kelaher and others in his team who have<br>made this happening a great advance in<br>terms of education dental education New<br>Zealand and a wonderful new initiative<br>I am truly proud and feel fortunate and<br>privileged to be a University of Otago<br>graduate before making some comments to<br>you I think it's important that we also<br>recognize and I'm talking to the<br>graduates here the people who have<br>supported all of you to reach this point<br>in your career you have encouraged you<br>during the entire challenging times and<br>celebrated in the good times easier your<br>parents and siblings and the wider<br>Farnell your partner's your lecturers<br>and teachers and faculty leaders all of<br>whom have contributed to this wonderful<br>occasion today they have been vital and<br>nurturing you and developing you leading<br>to today's culmination of all that<br>effort today you have become recognized<br>professionals and carry with that the<br>respect the trust and a public<br>expectation of commitment more years ago<br>than I'd like to admit I was where you<br>are today and my parents were sitting in<br>the auditorium what a proud day that was<br>I'll never forget it and neither will<br>you forget this day congratulations<br>again to all of you I'd like to spend a<br>few minutes in a more philosophical<br>frame not as a lecture but pepped is a<br>league as an observation and a<br>reflection but all the people are<br>inclined to do if anyone will listen<br>you're kept up right now<br>and so it's my chance and no one is<br>permitted to cry out okay boomer<br>I always remember the motto of my<br>relatively small primary school in<br>Auckland I'd read it as I stood outside<br>much in my shorts on a cold one Tuesday<br>morning it read enter to learn and leave<br>to serve at the time apart from being<br>merely words I had no idea what that<br>truly meant but now I do it all of you<br>are now entering the real world of the<br>healthcare system in New Zealand some of<br>you will continue postgraduate education<br>some of you will go into specialty or<br>research disciplines some of you will<br>hopefully go into teaching and some of<br>you will go into the coalface of<br>community health care services one thing<br>you all have in common of course is<br>student debt<br>you'll be precious to address this and<br>that's understandable<br>there'll be pressures on you for<br>productivity the repression on you to<br>conform to the health system<br>there'll be pressures on you to<br>integrate into the existing modes of<br>delivery and of course there'll be<br>pressure upon you to earn the trust and<br>support of the community that you're<br>about to serve eager to learn leave to<br>serve serving isn't just doing what's<br>expected of you following the party line<br>and conforming serving is taking<br>responsibility leading change when<br>change must be made challenging the<br>status quo when the odds seem impossible<br>and advocating for those who serve many<br>times it's not comfortable and many<br>times you have to withstand criticism<br>from your peers don't be afraid to speak<br>out and remember those who trust you and<br>respect you are depending on you<br>conformity does not create change an<br>optimal health delivery and development<br>required change hate anger to a target<br>or a janitor you've heard already today<br>people people people it's people you're<br>dealing with helping supporting and<br>improving their quality life it's people<br>who are relying on you<br>not just because of your clinical<br>expertise and knowledge but because they<br>know you they know that you care and<br>understand and that you are the guardian<br>of their best interests the complexity<br>of the health care environment often<br>obscures the need the real needs of our<br>community and the traditional silo<br>structure of health delivery while<br>condemned by many is still entrenched<br>with your own dentistry pharmacy<br>medicine or applied health medicine the<br>only way to make a difference is to
