Clive Ross has demonstrated this axiom
across his distinguished career at the
local national and international level
in 1997 he was recognized by the
government with the award of the
companion of the New Zealand Order of
Merit to services to dentistry Clare
Ross was born in Auckland the eldest of
what would be three children in the
family
his pharmacists father encouraged the
children's interest in education and all
became health professionals when Clive
and his good friend attended a session
with a school career guidance counselor
they were both advised not to bother
trying anything academic challenged
rather than deterred they both went on
to have stellar professional careers
while Auckland Grammar could Career
Guidance may have left a little to be
desired that was not the case with the
young woman
Wendy sheathe who Clive took to the
Auckland grammar ball
we welcome Wendy Ross here today Clive
acknowledges the centrality of their
partnership in parenting their three
children and in sustaining his career
Clive completed his intermediate year
for dentistry at the University of
Auckland and then enrolled at Otago
where he initially lived at Arana Hall
dentistry appealed because he enjoyed
working with people and working with his
hands
I've worked hard
chief distinctions and enjoyed student
life where he made lifelong friends
amongst his tight group of classmates
after graduation clive began private
practice in auckland postgraduate study
in the UK led to becoming a fellow of
the Royal College of Surgeons of England
in 1967 and the following year he became
the fellow of the Australasian College
of Dental Surgeons his specialty has
been restorative dentistry and he has
provided postgraduate training in oral
and maxillofacial surgery over his
career he has been witnessed to a
revolution and technology and materials
and dentistry the one constant has been
the people coming for care who Clive
argues should always be first and
foremost Clive's commitment to his
profession saw him take on service roles
at the local and in the national level
good mentors and those roles were
sounding boards who increased his
confidence that his opinion mattered
Clive's people skills and determination
to get jobs done meant he was in demand
both by the government and his
profession he was an inaugural member of
the New Zealand Board of Health from
1983 to 1985 and while on that body he
chaired the New Zealand task force to
report on primary health care funding in
New Zealand he has served with
distinction on every national dental
body including the New Zealand Dental
Association of which he is now an
honorary life member as each
subspecialty emerged clive took on
leadership roles such as president of
the New Zealand Society of
prosthodontics soon national leadership
led to international roles Clive was an
active member of the World Health
Organisation's expert Committee on oral
health for seven years he chaired the
joint
w-h-o world Dental Federation working
group on Workforce Planning
he became world president of the world
Dental Federation
and president of the International
College of dentists the largest
worldwide dental fraternity in each of
these roles clive displayed the skills
which have made him an exceptional
leader an ability to listen to people
with respect to allow the earring of
different views and to bring about
consensus which results in action on
committees composed of people with
various cultural backgrounds from rich
and poor countries and different
traditions of decision-making Clive has
achieved change to bring about
successful outcomes he has described
this work as like conducting an
orchestra of many different parts to
bring about a harmonious outcome in his
former role as director of clinical
dental services at the Auckland hospital
ward Clive was greatly respected for
superb management of his staff as well
as securing the best outcome for
patients his advice was welcomed when
improvements were sought at Dunedin
hospital Clive has been a committed
advocate for the Faculty of Dentistry
through examining students advising on
course structure and in providing
mentorship for staff Clive Rose is a man
who likes to get things done to bring
bring processes up-to-date and to ensure
that organisations have a clearly
articulated mission to serve their
communities his work on behalf of those
in need of dental care throughout the
world dedication to his profession and
service to government is underpinned by
a commitment to the greater good

before I start I would like to suggest
that all the guests give a hand to this
fabulous year this fabulous class of
2019
what a class act first I want to express
my very sincere gratitude and
appreciation for the honor you have just
invested in me today it is a very very
special occasion in my life which I'll
always treasure with pride and also with
humility these things do not happen on
their own and of course my wife Wendy
and my children who are here today which
is really very special they've had her
put up with the hours I've spent
meetings overseas or here in New Zealand
their support made their realizing my
passion possible thank you it's also a
very special occasion for me to be given
the opportunity to address the Graduate
for the Faculty of pharmacy and
dentistry in the medical laboratory
sciences my early background was in
pharmacy I lived by Breeze pharmacy
because my father was a pharmacist with
great commitment he was dedicated to
ensuring that pharmacy education was
relevant to the needs of the health
service and that pharmacists were fully
equipped not only to run a business but
also to meet the demands that the role
of a health professional required for
the future to this end he worked
tirelessly in the area of pharmacy
education and as one of the early
initiators leading to the establishment
of a pharmacy school in Lower Hutt how
amazed he would be see he would be today
to see the standards which pharmacy
school here in Otago has achieved his
level of excellence and the professional
achievement that is graduates you the
graduates have demonstrated within it of
course it goes without saying that I
have immense pride and respect for my
own dental faculty the Faculty of the
industry in whose affliction I have
bathed in all over the world you know it
also enjoys a state-of-the-art new
building with state-of-the-art teaching
technology in Auckland we have the
extension of the attacker faculty
I must congratulate the Dean and Peter
kelaher and others in his team who have
made this happening a great advance in
terms of education dental education New
Zealand and a wonderful new initiative
I am truly proud and feel fortunate and
privileged to be a University of Otago
graduate before making some comments to
you I think it's important that we also
recognize and I'm talking to the
graduates here the people who have
supported all of you to reach this point
in your career you have encouraged you
during the entire challenging times and
celebrated in the good times easier your
parents and siblings and the wider
Farnell your partner's your lecturers
and teachers and faculty leaders all of
whom have contributed to this wonderful
occasion today they have been vital and
nurturing you and developing you leading
to today's culmination of all that
effort today you have become recognized
professionals and carry with that the
respect the trust and a public
expectation of commitment more years ago
than I'd like to admit I was where you
are today and my parents were sitting in
the auditorium what a proud day that was
I'll never forget it and neither will
you forget this day congratulations
again to all of you I'd like to spend a
few minutes in a more philosophical
frame not as a lecture but pepped is a
league as an observation and a
reflection but all the people are
inclined to do if anyone will listen
you're kept up right now
and so it's my chance and no one is
permitted to cry out okay boomer
I always remember the motto of my
relatively small primary school in
Auckland I'd read it as I stood outside
much in my shorts on a cold one Tuesday
morning it read enter to learn and leave
to serve at the time apart from being
merely words I had no idea what that
truly meant but now I do it all of you
are now entering the real world of the
healthcare system in New Zealand some of
you will continue postgraduate education
some of you will go into specialty or
research disciplines some of you will
hopefully go into teaching and some of
you will go into the coalface of
community health care services one thing
you all have in common of course is
student debt
you'll be precious to address this and
that's understandable
there'll be pressures on you for
productivity the repression on you to
conform to the health system
there'll be pressures on you to
integrate into the existing modes of
delivery and of course there'll be
pressure upon you to earn the trust and
support of the community that you're
about to serve eager to learn leave to
serve serving isn't just doing what's
expected of you following the party line
and conforming serving is taking
responsibility leading change when
change must be made challenging the
status quo when the odds seem impossible
and advocating for those who serve many
times it's not comfortable and many
times you have to withstand criticism
from your peers don't be afraid to speak
out and remember those who trust you and
respect you are depending on you
conformity does not create change an
optimal health delivery and development
required change hate anger to a target
or a janitor you've heard already today
people people people it's people you're
dealing with helping supporting and
improving their quality life it's people
who are relying on you
not just because of your clinical
expertise and knowledge but because they
know you they know that you care and
understand and that you are the guardian
of their best interests the complexity
of the health care environment often
obscures the need the real needs of our
community and the traditional silo
structure of health delivery while
condemned by many is still entrenched
with your own dentistry pharmacy
medicine or applied health medicine the
only way to make a difference is to work
collaboratively presenting the same
messages and supporting each other
sounds easy
sounds obvious well it's not and making
this collaborative environment work is
very very difficult and now it's your
turn this philosophy of collaboration to
turn this philosophy of collaboration
into an effective reality the health
system is continuous subject to change
with population increase technology
changes society societal expectation
changes and the economics of delivery
this constant change
coupled with political and often
inflexible attitudes sometimes within
our own disciplines makes our response
to change slow cumbersome and even this
happen some areas of the health services
unseen is sexy dr. Harvey Brown
associate professor of dental school
previously wrote in an editorial for the
New Zealand Dental Association Journal
in 1977 on the absences of linkages we
know between oral health General Health
Pharmacy and the lack of liquidus within
primary health care health education and
promotion was the poor relation have we
seen changes since then not as much we
would've liked like I dare to say but
the wheel is slowly turning
you as new graduates are key to the
future it's you who will drive the
changes and it's you you'll now carry
the baton with fresh ideas and fresh
enthusiasm as recently as last month
professor David skeg wrote in the new
University of Otago magazine on the
length of leadership in a lack of
political will to deal with the
fundamental problems for public health
in New Zealand in my view which should
have been compulsory eating before your
graduation but you still have the
opportunity to read and think about his
heartfelt words the points he made are
important and I can't emphasize enough
that now it's your responsibility to
step up to the plate and shoulder
ownership of our new health system I
know perhaps I'm being a little bit
serious after all this is graduation and
tonight is party time and tomorrow and
you and that and daunting but exciting
phase begins but please if nothing else
you take away from today what do you
think how you participate in our now are
your health system at whatever level
does matter in conclusion let me say
this you've all had the privilege of
learning and training and developing
your various skills and problem-solving
expertise here in Dunedin at the
University of Otago never forget your
alma mater be proud of where you learn
to become a professional person be proud
of the values you've absorbed here and
those who patiently encouraged you and
noted you to this point in my
international commitments I was always
impressed and had a very good feeling
when colleagues at the epitome of their
careers would say oh you from the
University of Otago in the School of
Dentistry the imprimatur of the degrees
from this great university engenders
respect and brings with it
responsibilities and expectations of you
you are now part of the alumni and
that's very special enter to enter to
learn lead to serve have courage to be
wise and the years to come I would like
to think that you can look back on today
and say to yourselves in the paraphrase
words of an ancient sage it was not for
us to complete the task but nor will be
entitled to desist from it I've enjoyed
every minute of my professional life
with all the high points and the low
points and they've been plenty of those
my wish for you is when you get to look
back on your careers you can say the
same and many many of the low points be
seen as learning points congratulations
now go and have a good party tonight and
thank you for the opportunity
Thank You dr. Ross for your very
engaging and sagacious remarks I'm sure
our graduates today will take a lot away
from your address very grateful to you
all so your message about public health
is so important so significant can I

wish you all the very best with your
future endeavors
