University and the fine<br>university across the road from us our<br>brothers and sisters at a UT and so our<br>universities are going to formally<br>welcome us this morning and representing<br>University of Auckland we have associate<br>professor Damon Silesia who is our pro<br>vice-chancellor Pacifica and from aut we<br>have also professor Jeff Perry who is<br>acting vice chancellor of aut currently<br>where Nora in Arunachala erewan a toilet<br>solution at the material Jeff know my<br>technical to personate the volunteer<br>pool<br>my heart my Milani ma ma ma only donor<br>Dalit a little name key mythology Aloha<br>Tony Romo even to Pournami more he<br>knows a la carte Oh a melon oh boy - oh<br>here we motto Tai China go after the Box<br>tie we have that second part is not my<br>language but it's an important week in<br>New Zealand as of yesterday there's<br>Tamil language week and that was a<br>welcome to you and the Tamil language<br>which is a hello language of my<br>household but not mine<br>I'm married to a ton and it's an<br>important place to start because this<br>Auckland and both our universities are<br>located here in one of the world's most<br>specific cities we are surrounded by the<br>Pacific we belong to the Pacific and so<br>of course what you gather to talk about<br>today has an enormous impact on our part<br>of the world sustainability not just of<br>ireland's which are already facing<br>challenges but sustainability of the<br>people the ways of being their cultures<br>and as it's obvious a sign from God<br>their languages which we celebrate in<br>New Zealand so I welcome you with this<br>question of sustainable sustainability<br>at the front of your mind and the global<br>sustainability Development Goals which<br>provide this comprehensive and broad<br>frame map to guide action we know<br>they've been agreed to by 194 94<br>countries the goals and compass people<br>payment prosperity peace partnership<br>water land they focus on how to address<br>the world's greatest challenges<br>and I've set the unit the UN's<br>international community's agenda for the<br>next 20 years as universities which are<br>institutional members of the UN<br>instigated sustainable development<br>Solutions Network we recognize that the<br>main contributions to the SDGs are in<br>building knowledge for sustainability<br>educating the leaders of our future and<br>also in modeling sustainable practices<br>we're very proud and I'll confess a<br>little surprised to discover and the<br>first overall rankings of the inaugural<br>times higher education impact rating<br>that we were assessed alongside 450<br>universities from 76 countries against<br>the number of SDGs we will rank first<br>and health and well-being first equal<br>and partnerships for the goals six equal<br>and gender equality and seventh and<br>peace justice and strong institutions we<br>placed in the first twenty and other<br>categories including sustainable cities<br>and communities quality education decent<br>work in its growth economic growth and<br>reduced inequalities we were proud of<br>this but we recognized there's really<br>only one direction to go the university<br>takes enormous pressure our pleasure and<br>welcoming such a diverse range of youth<br>today<br>these include people from Central and<br>local government Marty Pacific community<br>groups NGOs businesses colleagues from<br>our eighth New Zealand universities and<br>we are so delighted to see so many young<br>people here today with delegates we wish<br>you all the best and sharing your<br>knowledge and experience and in working<br>together through<br>build action plans to accelerate the<br>progress on these important issues<br>together for me the urgency comes<br>directly out of our part of the world on<br>campus between a UTS campus and ours we<br>have something like six and a half<br>thousand young Pacific students most of<br>them trace their genealogies through<br>places who will be the first to feel so<br>many of the effects effects if we get it<br>wrong we live in a part of the world<br>which is one third of the Earth's<br>surface and often neglected in the way<br>that the world sees itself for me an<br>important journey to the SDGs<br>is to share that recognition that the<br>Pacific isn't at the margins of global<br>change or a canary in the gold mine the<br>Pacific is the battleground for our<br>future and with that I wish you all the<br>best<br>on these incredible deliberations and<br>welcome<br>that Pinacate couture and welcome to<br>everyone was here today mala in LA<br>it is song and language week so happy<br>Tongan language week to mark this year's<br>common language week Aug released a<br>video on social media last night that<br>features Liz the young Tongan AET alumna<br>who's doing amazing work with her small<br>lot for-profit company wonderful work in<br>partnership with the South Auckland<br>based social enterprise called<br>a for affirming works ever since the<br>sustainable development goals were<br>adopted in 2015 aut has been using the<br>seven pacific language weeks here in New<br>Zealand as a vehicle to showcase work<br>being done by her students staff and<br>alumni to address the Beryl's<br>the various global challenges<br>highlighted by the SDGs these videos<br>together have already amassed close to 1<br>million views choosing our Pacific<br>language weeks as a vehicle to address<br>SD G's is no accident for us that<br>locates our focus to where we are in the<br>world we live in a region where many of<br>our Pacific neighbors are already<br>experiencing many if not most of the<br>negative impacts of the challenges and<br>issues highlighted by the SDGs<br>we live in a country whose Prime<br>Minister only two weeks ago joined other<br>Pacific leaders of our region at the<br>50th Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu<br>where they collectively and I quote<br>reaffirmed climate change as the single<br>greatest threat to the livelihoods<br>security and well-being of the peoples<br>of the Pacific and I remind us that that<br>includes New Zealand we live in a city<br>that is not only becoming more Pacific<br>by the hour that's pointed out by my<br>fellow hosts PBC diamonds solicit in his<br>recent book but it's also a city in<br>which the divide between prosperity and<br>poverty is<br>wider and deeper by the hour where much<br>of that poverty is spatially located<br>than five of the six local boards they<br>constitute South Auckland I work at a<br>university that close to ten years ago<br>built a campus in the heart of Monaco to<br>offer a tangible and accessible pathway<br>out of poverty the South Auckland<br>communities I also work at a university<br>where today one in every five of our<br>domestic students come from<br>neighborhoods that have a score of nine<br>or ten on the new zealand depravation<br>and days we don't have to look very far<br>to find poverty and deprivation in our<br>neighbourhood so it is no accident that<br>over the last three years we have used<br>our Pacific language weeks as a vehicle<br>to highlight the challenge laid down by<br>the SDGs however it is an accident Pell<br>via an opportune one that this year's<br>overarching focus for our Pacific<br>language weeks is its DG 17 partnership<br>for the goals indeed a lack of cohesive<br>collective responsibility and effort<br>seems to pose the greatest threat to us<br>to achieving our targets by 2030 whether<br>it be on a multilateral level between<br>nations as highlighted by a keynote<br>speaker the right honourable Helen<br>Clarke and her recent Peter Fraser<br>lecture and Wellington law and a<br>collaborative level between large<br>organizations and entities like<br>universities each of our respective<br>universities have developed<br>sustainability plans last year we at aut<br>launched our sustainability roadmap<br>developed by the Vice Chancellors task<br>force chaired by Professor Thomas Nitsa<br>and consisting of students and staff<br>each of our universities does have<br>actions and initiatives in place and<br>have academic staff and postgraduate<br>students whose through their research<br>will contribute many solutions to the<br>various challenges highlighted by the<br>SDGs however there is clearly a growing<br>sense that collective older and more<br>courageous and selfless action is needed<br>as reflected in the theme for the summit<br>accelerated action together our two<br>universities jointly hosting the summit<br>is an important first step in this<br>collective action however more is needed<br>what is clear is that a much tighter<br>partnership between our institutions to<br>lend our collective and considerable<br>heft as large organizations in our city<br>working with the stakeholder groups many<br>of whom are in the room today is both<br>timely and required so that we can<br>together address the inequities of our<br>neighborhood and the SDGs I'm reminded<br>of an old proverb attributed to the<br>Greeks which I will paraphrase and adapt<br>for today's occasion society will only<br>be sustained if its people collectively<br>plant trees under whose shade they know<br>they shall never sit it's all part those<br>trees mala or people<br>that's your own Arunachala sous-chef<br>motto 10 arabic allah wa i thank you<br>both for the former welcome on behalf of<br>our host universities this morning<br>prepare your popcorn and your drinks<br>ladies and gentlemen we have the Prime<br>Minister soon to appear by our video the<br>right honourable descender Abdoun<br>recorded this presentation of New<br>Zealand's first voluntary national<br>review on sustainable development goals<br>kyoko kagawa here Walker Inc Inoue<br>which means towards I've been a future<br>together together is an important word<br>for us in New Zealand it sees a shared<br>vision it puts the people and how policy<br>decisions it's about building you know<br>happy healthy prosperous New Zealand<br>which everyone can benefit from to given<br>us is the core of our strategy to<br>deliver wellbeing and recognizes that<br>the spheres of our lives our environment<br>our people our economy are<br>interconnected and interdependent these<br>same principles like the heart of the<br>sustainable development goals now I'm<br>proud to visit New Zealand's first<br>voluntary national review on progress<br>towards the sustainable development<br>goals the report is a demonstration I<br>hope of our strong commitment to the<br>2030 agenda for sustainable development<br>New Zealand as many knows richly blessed<br>as a nation we have tremendous physical<br>and human resources we are a diverse and<br>agile nation where<br>and resilient but we also have our share<br>challenges and one of these is to ensure<br>that New Zealanders achieve a decent<br>standard of living and have a strong<br>sense of well-being leaving no one<br>behind requires openness and honesty<br>about the challenges we face and it is<br>an approach we brought to our first<br>review of the sustainable development<br>goals and to our domestic agenda as we<br>transition to a sustainable productive<br>and inclusive economy we do require a<br>deeper understanding of the groups who<br>will be most affected so that we can<br>ensure the right strategies in place to<br>support them it does require us to do<br>things differently it requires solid<br>disaggregated data to base decisions on<br>now we've developed a new suite of<br>statistical indicators so-called<br>indicators altaira or New Zealand they<br>go beyond economics to incorporate<br>social cultural and environmental<br>measures the indicators will provide a<br>clearer picture of New Zealand's overall<br>well-being as well as a measure of our<br>progress towards the sustainable<br>development goals alongside us we've<br>developed a new analytical framework<br>that emphasizes the diversity of<br>outcomes meaningful for New Zealanders<br>this living standards framework as it's<br>called will be part of our toolkit to<br>analyze and assess policy options that<br>enhance well-being and support New<br>Zealand's achievement of the sustainable<br>development goals New Zealand is<br>strongly committed to being a leader and<br>a constructive partner now<br>and internationally and the global<br>effort to create a more sustainable and<br>inclusive economy recognized that all<br>sustainable development goals are<br>connected and cannot be achieved by<br>governments alone this report also<br>highlights our government's priorities<br>including working towards eradicating<br>poverty improving mental health<br>addressing inequalities thriving in a<br>digital age and transitioning to a lower<br>mission sustainable economy these<br>initiatives are crucial to achieving the<br>Sustainable Development Goals we know<br>the cumulative value of small<br>incremental steps the day to day<br>decisions and actions that we make a<br>difference and change people's lives<br>we've seen and heard inspiring stories<br>of what New Zealanders are doing already<br>and we want to bring more New Zealanders<br>regardless of their circumstances or<br>experience along with us on the journey<br>in the spirit of gos 17 we are committed<br>to partnership partnership with Marty<br>the indigenous people of New Zealand and<br>partnerships with communities with<br>business and without international<br>friends we've made a good start our<br>challenge is to continue this momentum<br>together they will go again or<br>watching what happens today via

tena koutou tena<br>koutou katoa and mala weather late to<br>Tonga talking a language weak talofa<br>lava warmed Pacific greetings to you all<br>and good to be here to make some opening<br>remarks on the session at the conference<br>on the international context of the<br>sustainable development goals I'm going<br>to focus my comments mainly on the<br>international context but let's note at<br>the outset what you all know which is<br>that the sustainable development goals<br>and agenda 2030 are a universal agenda<br>meaning they apply from Somalia and<br>Kazakhstan to New Zealand and Canada it<br>was expected when leaders signed off on<br>them at the 2015 summit at the UN in New<br>York that they would make serious<br>efforts when they got back home to do<br>something about them the truth is as<br>I'll say in my remarks that the<br>international context is a little<br>depressing and a number of schools at<br>the present time however this agenda is<br>the right one it's the right direction<br>that colds are good the targets are good<br>there are rather a lot of them but if we<br>stuck with it we would have a<br>transformed and much more inclusive and<br>sustainable world than we we have today<br>so the development of the SDGs came out<br>of the rio +20 conference the UN<br>conference on sustainable development<br>which happened 20 years after the Earth<br>Summit and this was around three years<br>into my time as UNDP administrator and<br>from then on a very significant amount<br>of time was devoted by UNDP<br>and by me personally into supporting the<br>design of the SDGs and then<br>their early implementation UNDP itself<br>hosted an SDG hub which other agencies<br>seconded people into and we work<br>collaboratively to support national<br>consultations on STDs around the 2014<br>period global consultations thematic<br>consultations an online survey called my<br>world which eventually got 10 million<br>responses which asked people to rank<br>what their priorities for the SDGs were<br>and well no surprise the top three<br>issues always came out as health<br>education and jobs and number four was<br>good governance because so many people<br>realize that if the government<br>government doesn't have capabilities<br>development doesn't go terribly far now<br>when you think back to 2015 the year the<br>goals were developed really this was a a<br>high-water mark for setting global<br>development agendas<br>there was this monumental agenda there<br>was the Paris climate agreement that was<br>agreed December that year there was a<br>new framework for disaster risk<br>reduction which is incredibly important<br>contribution it's a sustainable<br>development and there was also a new<br>framework on international financing for<br>development agreed at Addis Ababa at the<br>Third International Conference on<br>financing for development and there was<br>one more major agreement that followed<br>in 2016 and that was the new urban<br>agenda<br>calling for inclusive safe resilient and<br>sustainable cities which was agreed at<br>Quito in Ecuador but since 2015 rather a<br>lot has happened in our world not least<br>major political change in key capitals<br>which is not at all conducive to any of<br>the agendas that I've just mentioned and<br>given that climate change represents one<br>of the greatest challenges to achieving<br>the SDGs it is of huge<br>significance when the world's largest<br>economy and only superpower gives notice<br>of its intention to withdraw from the<br>Paris agreement and when a brazilian<br>president encourages the expansion of<br>farming into the Amazon rainforest quite<br>disastrous as we see on our TV screens<br>every night now at the end of this month<br>the world leaders will convene again at<br>the UN General Assembly high-level week<br>and there will be a series of major<br>sites related to sustainable development<br>a specific one on the SDGs which is<br>billed as a leader level summit of the<br>high-level political forum on the SDGs<br>and they'll also be one on climate<br>there'll be a follow-up conference on<br>the summer pathway which sits the<br>sustainable development agenda for the<br>small island developing states that be a<br>universal health coverage summit and<br>there'll be one reviewing progress on<br>the FSF of a financing agenda the UN<br>secretary-general said several months<br>ago of the climate summit that when<br>leaders come please don't come with a<br>speech come with a plan and the same<br>thing could be said of what they bring<br>to all the others of its including the<br>SDG one because there is growing concern<br>at the lack of traction on achieving the<br>SDGs at the global level for example on<br>poverty eradication the goal is<br>eradication by 2030 but there are no<br>serious forecasts that suggest that far<br>from achieving that we could stall by<br>2030 see up to 6 percent of the world's<br>population and that could be up to 475<br>million people living under the $1 91<br>extreme a day extreme poverty line<br>hunger eradication there's also target<br>for 2030 and yet each year the last<br>three years the world food<br>program has been reporting that there<br>are growing numbers of hungry people in<br>the world now standing at over 820<br>million that's about 109<br>of every human being on education well<br>as was said in the introduction I<br>currently chair the advisory board for<br>the UNESCO global education monitoring<br>report which looks at progress on this<br>basic targa than the SDGs every 6 to 17<br>year olds shall enjoy<br>12 years education by 2030 on current<br>trends 1 and every 6 children will miss<br>that so none of this is good and the<br>list could go on and to it of course<br>must be added the absolutely woeful<br>state of biodiversity and the climate<br>ecosystem and these in turn exacerbate<br>the vulnerability of the world's poorest<br>people as well we have the level of<br>forced displacement caused by war and<br>conflict that's at record levels now<br>standing at over 70 million on the worst<br>case scenario for climate change which<br>may well be realistic at the current<br>rate of progress the World Bank is<br>estimating that another 143 million<br>people in sub-saharan Africa South Asia<br>and Latin America will be displaced and<br>that is not counting the many millions<br>of vulnerable in South and Southeast<br>Asia so these are very significant<br>challenges to sustainable development at<br>the global level and they need a<br>concerted response and they need a focus<br>on the most vulnerable so it's all the<br>more concerning that the latest oacd<br>figures on development assistance show a<br>decline overall of 2.7 percent in Oda<br>from 2017 to 18 with aid to Africa<br>falling by 4 percent the climate finance<br>promised by developed countries is<br>falling well short of where it should be<br>and that matters enormous Lee for both<br>adaptation and mitigation particularly<br>in the<br>tourist countries I've always seen the<br>SDGs as a bold and visionary agenda<br>which have implemented as I said would<br>bring about transformational change but<br>currently the world is rather off track<br>for that great outcome international<br>solidarity will continue to be very<br>important for the poorest countries<br>indeed absolutely essential of poverty<br>and hunger are to be banished by 2030<br>and of other basic human development<br>goals in the SDG agenda to be reached<br>but here's where we need that joined up<br>thinking these goals can't be met if the<br>environment continues to be pillaged<br>last week the head of the secretariat<br>for the UN Convention on biodiversity<br>expressed her concern that we're moving<br>towards tipping points which should<br>could produce she used the phrase<br>cascading collapses of natural<br>ecosystems think about it chess Kading<br>collapses of natural ecosystems there<br>was the UN report in May that warned<br>that a million species are on the verge<br>of extinction pledges on climate action<br>as of late last year put the world on<br>track for three degrees warming by the<br>end of the century which is far above<br>the one point five degree aspiration of<br>the Paris agreement and this has very<br>serious implications for countries rich<br>and poor including our own so the UN<br>summits in New York later next month the<br>world leaders do have the opportunity to<br>face up to these scenarios and<br>determined to make a course correction I<br>think more developments support for the<br>poorest and more climate action across<br>the board would be a very good start<br>so can you Zealand lead on this yes we<br>can at home and abroad<br>it has stepped up off a low base on<br>development assistance and the<br>government has agreed on its framework<br>for climate change policy<br>aimed at reducing greenhouse gas<br>emissions and building climate<br>resilience there is the zero carbon bill<br>before Parliament ideally it does need<br>cross-party support to spare New Zealand<br>from the stop-go approach which it has<br>had to climate action over the last two<br>decades overall my assessment is that<br>New Zealand's strategies and policy<br>approaches currently are not<br>inconsistent not inconsistent with what<br>is needed to make progress on the<br>sustainable development goals but our<br>country has yet to formally adopt an SDG<br>strategy and targets as the recent<br>people's report prepared by civil<br>society organisations points out so New<br>Zealand leadership on the SDGs would be<br>enhanced by moving to embrace a formal<br>strategy with targets and a commitment<br>to monitoring and accountability in line<br>with the approach of so many other<br>countries around the world so let's hope<br>today as discussions will help define<br>how New Zealand can move forward on the<br>SDGs<br>and help contribute to the global<br>momentum and action which is very badly<br>needed right now thank you<br>there are material in Tanakh where<br>modified meeting up or corridor<br>hey Mathari yeah after King otaku<br>came to Eternity auroral Thank You Helen<br>for providing what we expected you would<br>rather than a grandiose and glorious<br>speech rather points of action and the<br>motivation and an encouragement to to<br>make some of the changes that you<br>encouraged us to do and to do further we<br>would now like to invite members of our<br>tow mater our very first panel for this<br>morning and I'm not too sure if you've<br>arrived Russell Russell you've arrived<br>okay fantastic so if I could call<br>Jacqueline Russell and Rachel down to<br>hi Jeff Sachs I'm director of the United<br>Nations sustainable development<br>Solutions Network and also SDG advocate<br>for un secretary-general Antonio<br>Guterres I'm thrilled to have the<br>opportunity to say hello to you on this<br>second New Zealand SDG summit<br>congratulations to all of you for your<br>leadership congratulations to the<br>University of Auckland and the Auckland<br>University of Technology to great<br>institutions that are co-hosting this<br>event and I'm thrilled to be a small<br>part of it thank you for the invitation<br>New Zealand is a leader in the world we<br>look to do Zealand for its leadership as<br>you know New Zealand is one of the best<br>performing countries in the sustainable<br>development goals in the world I co-edit<br>the annual SDG index and dashboards<br>report and in the 2019 report New<br>Zealand ranks 11th in the world about a<br>hundred sixty countries this is very<br>very good and you should be very much<br>encouraged maybe even happier news for<br>you is that in the world happiness<br>report that I also co-edited for the<br>United Nations New Zealand in 2019 ranks<br>eighth New Zealand is on the whole a<br>happy and successful country but the<br>truth is as you know very well no single<br>country even the top ranked countries<br>are not on track to achieve the<br>sustainable development goals in the<br>Paris climate agreement not because we<br>can't in New Zealand is a rich<br>prosperous country that can achieve all<br>of the SDGs and can achieve the<br>decarbonization needed<br>to stay within the limits set in the<br>Paris climate agreement it's a matter of<br>strategy it's a matter of planning it's<br>a matter of expertise such as the host<br>institutions offer to New Zealand<br>Society it's of course a matter of our<br>individual understanding and coalition<br>as well in a rich world there's no<br>excuse for the dangers that we are<br>causing ourselves with human induced<br>climate change and there's no excuse in<br>the rich world to have people still<br>struggling in abject poverty or lacking<br>the basic economic needs or more than<br>200 million kids worldwide I wouldn't<br>school there is simply no excuse well<br>you're going to solve these problems for<br>New Zealand help to orient your<br>wonderful country to achieve these<br>movies in the Paris climate agreement<br>and let me say thank you to your<br>inspiring Prime Minister Prime Minister<br>our turn is respected worldwide and her<br>leadership is respected worldwide and<br>her contribution and her government's<br>contribution this year with a 20-19<br>well-being budget is being watched with<br>enormous interest I've heard a lot of<br>jealousy shouldn't be in the United<br>States with this great contribution as<br>all of you know the well-being budget<br>prioritizes the five areas to zealand<br>mental helped child poverty religionists<br>of people's rights and needs<br>decarbonization and flourishing in the<br>digital age these are all of it every<br>one of them sustainable development<br>goals and the idea of or<br>to the national budget directly in this<br>way well-being budget of measuring life<br>satisfaction as one of the key<br>indicators for government in the days of<br>years ahead is extremely important let<br>me point out the areas where New Zealand<br>has some work to do what our index shows<br>of some serious challenges that New<br>Zealand faces one is surprisingly on<br>public health New Zealand<br>like my own country which is a bit worse<br>has an obesity epidemic which is mainly<br>the result of our fast food industry<br>deregulated putting forward to our<br>children to the society unhealthy foods<br>and this is a heavy burden well being<br>and causing disease and premature death<br>so this is an area where New Zealand it<br>definitely needs to do some work and I<br>believe that regulating the fast food<br>industry is a major starting point a<br>second area that I would stress is<br>decarbonisation New Zealand already gets<br>most of its power from zero carbon<br>energy but is still a major emitter of<br>fossil fuel co2 and also more generally<br>of greenhouse gases from the agriculture<br>sector so who Zealand adds a lot of work<br>to do to get to zero renovations most of<br>all in my view this requires a national<br>plan I would really encourage the<br>universities to get together and work<br>with government on a serious<br>engineering-based<br>national strategy to get it to zero by<br>2050 a third area that New Zealand needs<br>is much greater effort<br>conservation of biodiversity as you know<br>many species in New Zealand damming to<br>New Zealand are on the IUCN Red List New<br>Zealand is at risk of losing major<br>biomes though wetlands and a major of<br>species that are unique to your very<br>beautiful country a last area that I<br>would like to make an appeal is New<br>Zealand's contributions to the SPG's<br>through Development Assistance New<br>Zealand is a bridge and a generous<br>people but the level of the development<br>aid as a share of gross national product<br>falls far short of the global target of<br>0.7% of GDP in a rich world with still<br>affiliate abject ly poor people and more<br>than 200 million kids out of school we<br>need development hey if I could suggest<br>a New Zealand could use its development<br>aid to help promote the concepts of<br>well-being budgets the development aid<br>could help other countries to orient<br>their budgets to achieve the sustainable<br>development goals well I think I could<br>talk too long for the short message that<br>you invited me to give let me<br>congratulate you again let me tell you<br>how much we admire your country we want<br>to see you even higher on the SDG list<br>and the happiness list we know that your<br>well-being budget is going to help get<br>you there and we really want to see New<br>Zealand South these remaining and tough<br>problems and also to help lead the world<br>your wonderful example to solve these<br>problems all over the world all best<br>wishes on a hugely successful s<br>conscience on thank you so much in our<br>first panel session and it is my<br>privilege to welcome each of our<br>panelists we will be treated by<br>Jacqueline first then by Russell and<br>then by Rachel to add to those messages<br>of encouragement and and to take<br>leadership roles to add to those which<br>were offered to us by Helen this morning<br>first panelist this morning is dr.<br>Jacqueline Parisi<br>Jacqueline supports the Council for<br>international development and the areas<br>of strategy planning and business<br>development as an executive of the<br>impacts effect her focus is<br>strengthening not-for-profit<br>organizations and building social<br>enterprises recent projects have seen<br>her working in Thailand the Lao People's<br>Democratic Republic Cambodia China<br>Myanmar New Zealand and Indonesia<br>Jacqueline has held executive leadership<br>roles in the private public and<br>development aid sectors and in the<br>international and in international<br>consulting firms<br>she also supervises doctoral candidates<br>engaged in academic research or made two<br>pukka pukka mojo<br>good morning I'm told I've got five<br>minutes to say what I've got to say<br>which is quite a challenge because I<br>really have so much to say but I'll try<br>and keep it short so that's it so we see<br>so many sectors contributing to the SDGs<br>but not necessarily in a purposeful<br>manner four years ago title research<br>titled are the rich countries ready<br>outlined an assessment of richer<br>countries preparedness for the SDGs the<br>report identified several strengths for<br>New Zealand but also several weaknesses<br>including the high obesity rates we've<br>spoken up this morning poor education<br>for some low socio-economic groups and<br>inefficient usage usage of energy so how<br>are we doing as a nation now four years<br>later well as we know in sport and in<br>business New Zealand punches well above<br>its weight yet it seems it matter where<br>it matters even more we seem to be less<br>focused we're currently ranked 11th on<br>the world SDG league table okay so given<br>this is out of 162 you might think this<br>is a pretty good result however I<br>believe we should really be showing more<br>collective commitment and passion and be<br>aspiring to a top three spot currently<br>held by Denmark Sweden and Finland also<br>we may think we're making a real<br>contribution but according to Vic<br>University's interactive data model<br>since 2015 there's been little<br>measurable change with the exception of<br>drastic improvement in climate action<br>rodham and a slight improvement in no<br>poverty no other STDs have improved and<br>gender equality has reportedly gone<br>slightly backwards but measurements<br>complex<br>to measure progress here in New Zealand<br>we have no less than five constructs to<br>consider there the 17 global SDGs<br>themselves with their 169 targets and<br>they're evolving list of 250 200 44<br>charm indicators we have the New Zealand<br>living standards framework we've got the<br>living standards framework dashboard for<br>the outcomes our people our country our<br>future then there are the ia NZ metrics<br>and of course there's also the voluntary<br>national review so linkages have been<br>designed between these instruments but<br>they're not yet fully operative some<br>linkages are more loose than others and<br>some of the SDGs aren't actually covered<br>the intention is to map these the living<br>standards to the SDGs but it's not clear<br>whether the mapping will demonstrate<br>just alignment or whether it will<br>actually measure contribution so I<br>confess to being a little bit confused<br>as to understanding how we'll really<br>know that we've achieved them the<br>multi-pronged approach appears to be a<br>little unscientific and as a nation how<br>involved are we in the whole scg<br>dialogue at the government level there's<br>definitely engagement evidence by the<br>resources allocated to such things as<br>the living standards framework and the<br>other constructs mark mentioned but<br>what's happening at a regional Pacific<br>level it's true<br>New Zealand's international aid is<br>highly cognizant of and aligned with the<br>STG ascendant agenda having said this<br>SIDS annual survey indicates that many<br>of our members who are probably among<br>the most STG aware in the country are in<br>response of the SDGs really only<br>changing the language they use but<br>that's not what I really mean when I say<br>what's happening<br>Regional Pacific level while New Zealand<br>is definitely assisting Pacific<br>neighbors address priorities I'm<br>interested in regional collaboration and<br>synchronization is like what<br>synchronization is taking place across<br>the region and across the Pacific<br>are we leveraging regional opportunities<br>for synergy is there an opportunity to<br>work with the Pacific and find a way to<br>collectively and contribute a measure<br>SDG impact across the region impacts not<br>contained to tidy countries it drifts<br>across borders into neighboring<br>countries so does it not make sense to<br>collaborate regionally and at the same<br>time role model globally how regions can<br>work together for the good of our planet<br>leaving no one behind and at a public<br>level are the people of New Zealand<br>really aware of the SDGs and of New<br>Zealand's role and performance in this<br>journey I was speaking to a<br>well-educated middle-aged friend a few<br>nights ago he had no idea what the STDs<br>were so just how engaged as a country<br>and a region are we with the goal of<br>leaving no one behind is the process<br>itself in danger of doing just that so<br>to conclude I think I'm nearly up to<br>five minutes but to conclude I believe<br>the potential lies in three areas first<br>leadership scg's aren't designed for<br>politicians but require political<br>leadership we need to have targets one<br>way to measure them politicize them get<br>behind them and do them secondly<br>participation the leaders need to engage<br>the people of New Zealand in the<br>importance of the SDGs and inspire<br>people to care about them and all<br>sectors need to be engaged in the<br>journey and thirdly lastly partnerships<br>let's revitalize partner<br>for the SDGs and ensure regional<br>collaboration let's demonstrate to the<br>rest of the world SDG leadership and<br>together secure a top three spot in the<br>SDG index Thank You Tin aquajet whoo<br>we're privileged also to have with us<br>this morning this morning's panel<br>Russell Norman Russell is the executive<br>director of Greenpeace altaïr or New<br>Zealand and prior to this he was a<br>member of the New Zealand Parliament and<br>co-leader of the Green Party during its<br>period of growth leading up to 2004 the<br>2014 election Russell was the party<br>spokesperson on economics and<br>Environment and development of the<br>party's economic policy he has a PhD in<br>political science and his areas of<br>expertise include economics climate<br>energy and freshwater ecosystems<br>karara's tena koe over this place thank<br>you very much for that kind introduction<br>I always think it's funny how you get to<br>write your own introduction I could have<br>written anything in there would have<br>been fantastic so basically I'm from<br>Greenpeace I was I work in global<br>climate change staff and biodiversity<br>and so when you look at the issues that<br>the great issue of climate change which<br>threatens to wipe out the gains in<br>pretty much every other area one of the<br>key things that that is really apparent<br>right at the start is we need more<br>global cooperation we need more global<br>governance we can't solve a problem like<br>climate change by ourselves and no<br>matter how good we are number 11 or<br>number 8 in happiness<br>so in terms of the contributing to the<br>number 8 and happiness I'm not<br>and out there right okay so I because we<br>can solve this problem unless we have<br>more global cooperation now you'd think<br>that the world would be awash with<br>support for globalization I mean we've<br>had 30 years now of globalization and<br>the promotion of globalization you<br>couldn't escape it and it was part of<br>the official doctrine of most<br>governments in the west over the last 35<br>years or so and yet we find that in a<br>world which is desperate for more global<br>cooperation we have the rise of the<br>opposite we have a rise of nationalism<br>we have a rise of xenophobia and we have<br>a series of key governments now around<br>the world who are turning their back on<br>global projects so why is it that after<br>35 years of this amazing globalization<br>project led by the party of Davos the<br>global elites who meet each year in<br>Davos the party of Davos as Steve Benin<br>calls it who's one of Donald Trump's and<br>key advisors why is it that after 35<br>years of the party of Davos telling us<br>all that globalization is a great thing<br>there's not that much support for it and<br>the answer's not very hard to find the<br>reason is is that when you go to the<br>United States there's still dramatic<br>poverty right when you go to this<br>country this is amazingly rich country<br>and 40 percent or thereabout of American<br>families if they were said could do you<br>have full four hundred bucks cause your<br>car's broken down they'd have to borrow<br>the money to pay the bill and yet at the<br>same time when we look globally there is<br>a massive concentration of wealth in the<br>top 1% of the global population or even<br>less than 1% so after 35 years of this<br>amazing globalization what we find is<br>that there is this massive concentration<br>of wealth in there our grates waves of<br>the middle class as they used to be<br>called but they're just working-class<br>people in the United States and other<br>places who still their lives are more<br>precarious than ever their wages are<br>lower than ever their wages of either<br>stagnated or that goal they haven't gone<br>anywhere that or they've gone down in in<br>their their lives are more precarious<br>than ever more people at age 70 in the<br>United States are declaring for<br>bankruptcy<br>so are we surprised that middle-class<br>working-class people around the world<br>have rejected this neoliberal<br>globalization that has been offered to<br>us so what I would say is if we want the<br>global cooperation that we so<br>desperately need we need a different<br>kind of globalization we need a<br>different kind of globalism we can't<br>have what we've just been through<br>because it has discredited globalization<br>it has been globalization for the party<br>of Davos for the wealthy for the rich<br>and ordinary people have not benefited<br>from that so it's hardly surprising then<br>anti-establishment candidate like Donald<br>Trump at least that's how it presents<br>himself an anti-establishment candidate<br>like Donald Trump was able to find a<br>ready audience amongst those people and<br>it's not just that we've also neoliberal<br>globalization has institutionalized a<br>whole bunch of structures that make it<br>hard to do what we need to do one<br>climate change the state of Hamburg<br>tried to stop a coal-fired power station<br>it was blocked because the company that<br>was trying to do it sued them through a<br>trade agreement an investor agreement<br>and when Obama tried to block the<br>Keystone XL pipeline he was sued by the<br>company under the North American Free<br>Trade Agreement<br>right because it said it would lose it<br>would lose money about it and when the<br>states in in Canada tried to stop<br>fracking they were sued under the North<br>American Free Trade Agreement these<br>trade agreements which have become the<br>de-facto high level of globalization<br>neoliberal globalization are making it<br>harder for us to deal with global<br>problems because they're not designed to<br>protect the climate they're not designed<br>to protect us they're designed to<br>protect corporations so we need to<br>explicitly reject that kind of corporate<br>neoliberal globalization and rebuild a<br>real globalization that actually<br>protects the climate it says to<br>companies if you are going to lose money<br>because we're going to save the climate<br>tough luck we need to overturn those<br>kind of investor state dispute<br>settlement<br>and that kind of neoliberal<br>globalization in order to rebuild the<br>kind of global cooperation and the real<br>globalization of people that we need<br>turn our aqua career Russell we're<br>fortunate Nicks to have in our midst a<br>Rachel Lamas Yuri and Rachel as the<br>director executive director of

the tip una for the<br>guardianship kaitiaki of the Fenner<br>we're here I think which is something<br>we're all very grateful for and I think<br>we're going to draw down on a need look<br>going into the future<br>my name is Rachel in Assyria I grew up<br>in the Waikato within my hour is the<br>Waikato my manga is manga totally I've<br>been the IDI of Oxford New Zealand now<br>for over five years and am very very<br>delighted to be on this panel and as the<br>opening session for the New Zealand SDG<br>session it'll be no surprise that for<br>Oxfam the international context is front<br>and center and we've have we have very<br>significant focus on st g1 s TG 5 6 8 10<br>and 13 and now i'm gonna wonder how do I<br>move the next slide oh but for us this<br> Toki is probably the most<br>important one and it summarises the<br>meaning of SDG 17 when we pedal in<br>unison when we work<br>together we do believe that this is the<br>actual underlying premise of SDG 17 and<br>the context of this panel it's very much<br>around what is the international context<br>and for us that's very much about<br>recognizing both the current and the<br>potential role for the new zealand<br>government and New Zealand's leadership<br>but noting very much that under STG 17<br>and this panel where we have been<br>challenged to ask or to look into the<br>future a little and see what are the<br>emerging trends some of the challenges<br>that are both with us now and coming<br>coming down the road towards us and och<br>Stan's been developing a range of<br>scenarios over the last couple of months<br>that are looking at those very things<br>that are very global challenges and I<br>wanted to share those with you as part<br>of a way to generate a discussion about<br>these five scenarios that have been<br>brought together by 10,000 of my<br>colleagues hundreds of our partner<br>organizations all around the world and<br>fundamental to these scenarios is that<br>each and every SDG is interconnected<br>that we actually need a systems approach<br>to the complexity that these scenarios<br>are proposing for us and really<br>recognizing that what the same time is<br>good stuff can and will happen at the<br>same time as bad stuff is going to<br>happen and nothing will remain static so<br>let me give you a whistle-stop tour in<br>view of the fact that I've got two<br>minutes left and how did that happen<br>the first one up is obviously climate<br>change and that's very much about<br>recognizing that there is going to be<br>increasing conflicts and divergent<br>responses of government communities<br>women and youth movements and the<br>private sector to the climate emergency<br>and to the progress on STG 13 itself who<br>might win and lose these battles how<br>those those in power may try and find<br>solutions and for whom and how power<br>could shift between different actors<br>these will be uppermost as progressive<br>governments try to progress keeping us<br>below the 1.5 degrees warming<br>second one has very much the movement of<br>people and as we see whether it is from<br>rural areas or outer islands from places<br>of conflict climate destruction<br>political oppression economic inequality<br>people will be on the move for safety<br>food better opportunities and quality of<br>life this is already driving rapid<br>demographic changes class divisions<br>xenophobia racism and poverty these will<br>put a burden on resources but<br>particularly within and across<br>developing countries technology and<br>human rights one of those areas where<br>they've both progress and there's<br>extraordinary challenges large<br>multinational technology companies will<br>weld more power blurring the lines<br>between nation states and corporations<br>and seeking to decrease people's agency<br>and civic space however their power is<br>increasingly being challenged by active<br>citizens who are using technology to<br>mobilize people in various movements<br>both on the right and on the left<br>shifting global order now increasingly<br>it's highly probable that global and<br>national institutions are becoming<br>dysfunctional undermining the existing<br>rules based global value system and<br>norms this is going to be a major<br>challenge to progressive governments who<br>want to strengthen the implementation of<br>SDGs lastly in these five scenarios is<br>inequality in the abuse of power power<br>grows in the hands of authoritarian<br>governments corporations and anti rights<br>actors<br>however counter movements are also<br>growing we are seeing this feminist<br>black lives movement youth and community<br>activism also growing what we are seeing<br>is a democracy and the ballot box at<br>local regional national and<br>multinational levels will be<br>increasingly tested well many of us will<br>be looking to this leadership what we<br>have to acknowledge as we also have this<br>leadership this is our coalition<br>government for us to acknowledge and<br>recognize what the prime minister said<br>in her speech that New Zealand has this<br>commitment to being a leader being part<br>of the global effort to create<br>sustainable and inclusive economies<br>having a deeper understanding of those<br>most affected that it's not achievable<br>by governments alone<br>we also want to recognize that to do<br>this in a time of such radical volatile<br>change we need an STD minister in<br>cabinet a significant signal to New<br>Zealanders that SDGs are measuring to<br>this government and have their STG abet<br>Minister and the responsibility for the<br>STD response in the Department of the<br>Prime Minister and cabinet there is<br>literally no more higher or senior role<br>we also need our government to be a<br>progressive nation to ensure that sorry<br>progressive voice to protect the SDGs<br>legitimacy which we are going to see<br>under increasing threat and the global<br>market multilateral system to be part of<br>that global effort as Jeffrey Sachs said<br>we've got to do better on our Oda we are<br>moving but we've got to have a timeline<br>so we know when we're going to get to<br>0.7 we've got to increase the OTAs focus<br>on poverty reduction resource<br>mobilization and developing an aid for<br>trade strategy well overdue if we are<br>going to have a deeper understanding of<br>those most affected we've got to make<br>sure we have a real focus on reducing<br>violence against women and children half<br>of the world's population we've got to<br>also look at the marginalized women and<br>girls in that context this is not going<br>to be achievable unless we make sure as<br>she has that the Prime Minister has said<br>that we're all included in this walker<br>we must have ensure that we include a we<br>and Mardy leadership at the global level<br>as well as civil society private sector<br>and academia lastly we need an<br>international development cooperation<br>policy and thank you so much for your<br>patience holding up the stop sign thank<br>you<br>Jackie Russel Norman Rachel at the fire<br>for Kia Helen those of you while you're<br>still sitting on your seats and the<br>Walker we now have some questions for<br>you which will just soon shall we say<br>given the the the brief period of time<br>we have left in this session thank you<br>so my name is Maria de rocha and I am<br>actually the SDG site editor and<br>administrator currently the only one on<br>our very small team and dr. Jacqueline<br>actually mentioned very briefly when she<br>was speaking about our tool that is data<br>based it's a data visualization that<br>does negate our impression of progress<br>towards each of these individual SDGs<br>goals indicators based on data collected<br>working with statistics New Zealand oacd<br>reports etc essentially showing that not<br>only do we have a striking lack of data<br>but also that it hasn't changed in its<br>trajectory much over time so my question<br>was asked basically just in the interest<br>of getting that information out there<br>for people to interact with and see you<br>know where is it coming from this model<br>that shows we don't have as much<br>progress as we'd like so my question was<br>admittedly what is the SDG tool by a Vic<br>University that negates our impression<br>of progress where is it found just<br>because I really would like everyone in<br>the audience to have that information<br>available to them so thank you I<br>apologize that it wasn't a direct<br>question to the panel so yes just a<br>response the issue of data has been one<br>of the most discussed in the development<br>of the SDGs and then in discussion about<br>implementation and of course<br>first thing you do need a strategy you<br>do need targets you do need indicators<br>and then you need to measure progress<br>now what was apparent from a very early<br>stage of the SDGs was that actually no<br>country had access to the information<br>that required to measure progress so<br>there has to be a huge upskilling<br>in the official statistics collections<br>across countries rich and poor one of<br>the jobs the UN system was doing in<br>capital in developing countries was to<br>help build statistical office capacity<br>and that is a very worthy endeavor by<br>the way for official development<br>assistance agencies to build that<br>capacity to collect and monitor data but<br>another point that was always made was<br>that data then has to be presented in a<br>form that's accessible so that civil<br>society can use it because with<br>monitoring it's not only official<br>monitoring it's also civil society the<br>media parliamentarians keeping an eye on<br>on what is happening and clearly to get<br>traction on this in New Zealand we would<br>be have to be much more structured<br>better official statistics stats working<br>with efforts like the very interesting<br>one you're involved with at Victoria<br>upskilling and supporting civil society<br>organisations one last point the<br>International Organization of auditors<br>general came down with a decision from<br>its conference about two-three years ago<br>calling on every Audit Office in the<br>world to develop tools for auditing<br>progress on national SDG progress so all<br>this has got traction out there and and<br>would be great to see a push out of a<br>conference like this one and all your<br>efforts assembled here to get that<br>moving in New Zealand slide I was<br>working now far note so perhaps let's go<br>for this meaty question right here the<br>one right at the top what can young<br>people students do to help and I think<br>that's an appropriate question given<br>and great question and I've just<br>finished seven local city events across<br>the country around particularly climate<br>breakdown and this was one of the<br>question that the the in every single<br>one Dunedin Nelson Christchurch toad on<br>the Hamilton out of the audience came<br>yes but what can we do whether you're a<br>student whether you're in the workforce<br>and I think one of the best answers came<br>from a wonderful young woman called<br>Timmy and the waikato who's part of the<br>school strike and what she actually said<br>to that question was just do something<br>just do something now what she meant was<br>take a small action whatever that may<br>mean<br>it may mean joining going on the school<br>strike on the 27th of September for<br>example every form of collective action<br>that we take is actually part of a<br>progress on the SDGs and many of those<br>collective actions this is presuming at<br>their progressive collective actions are<br>actually connected up to those key<br>issues whether it's inequality whether<br>it's tax justice whether its climate<br>breakdown so as students whether it's<br>within your your home your how you get<br>to school how you get to uni what you do<br>in your class what the class is studying<br>what you how you're engaging with each<br>other socially all of this is such a key<br>part of progressing STDs and obviously<br>your degree the more air cadet are more<br>skilled and talented knowledgeable<br>people we've got coming out of<br>universities who have integrated their<br>degree work in with the SDGs is going to<br>be hugely helpful I think just building<br>on what Rachel said also use and<br>students I think have a great role to<br>play in the advocacy of STDs and as I<br>said like I have middle-aged friends who<br>actually don't know what the SDGs are I<br>suspect more young people do know than<br>the people of our age bracket but so I<br>think just talk to as many people as you<br>can about<br>and integrate it into what you're<br>studying and the way you're you're<br>communicating and just yeah just keep<br>the dialogue moving thank you here's the<br>wow that rather topical one does anyone<br>on the panel have an opinion on New<br>yeah we should do it right but more than<br>that we should actually do something and<br>to cut our emissions say you know so<br>just answering the last pictures in<br>September 27 like there's a there's a<br>big national action there's a global<br>action that week so if we keep doing<br>what we're doing we are gonna have a<br>climate catastrophe right that's what<br>that's that's what we're on path for so<br>we have to disrupt this system right<br>because this system will deliver 4<br>degrees of warming by the end of the<br>century if it carries on that's what<br>it's going to deliver right so we have<br>to disrupt it so come to the thing on<br>September 27 organize a whole bunch of<br>other people climate emergency yeah<br>let's have a climate emergency let's<br>declare we do it is an emergency no<br>question about it<br>but more importantly we must change the<br>and just one more question and while we<br>have the privilege of a former prime<br>minister among us this morning<br>Helen Clarke what are some of the<br>standout actions you've seen around the<br>world which have been upwards the<br>negative trajectory of SDG achievement<br>well I think there's there's two big<br>issues one is what's happening to the<br>climate and the the other is the extent<br>of of war and conflict not just formal<br>conflict but also the the societies that<br>are completely mired in civil insecurity<br>high levels of gang violence and and so<br>on I mean take for example the scenes we<br>see played out on the u.s. southern<br>border why are people leaving Central<br>America it is a combination of actually<br>climate change at work there's a lot of<br>writing now about that the drought in<br>the region which is which is really<br>affecting the subsistence small farming<br>but also you have huge inequality huge<br>poverty and societies record by gang<br>warfare so put these together you have<br>the perfect storm on the on the u.s.<br>southern border what's the USS reward to<br>cut development a you know because the<br>people won't stop migrating I mean this<br>is this is ridiculous but overall if you<br>have a world in which 70 million are<br>forcibly displaced by conflict the<br>spillover effects of that are very very<br>significant not least in the<br>humanitarian response that has to happen<br>because you're talking lives health<br>well-being water food that then becomes<br>a charge against what is available for<br>longer-term development so it is like a<br>perfect storm what we're in at the<br>moment and to see wars like the Syrian<br>one the Yemen one the Libyan conflict<br>perpetrated essentially by proxies who<br>are standing behind the warring party<br>parties is very deteriorated<br>it's distressing so you know the voices<br>of small progressive countries like New<br>Zealand are needed on on these issues to<br>stop us career ping towards a a number<br>of tipping points the climate tipping<br>point the the the biodiversity tipping<br>point the you know the tipping point<br>where it becomes impossible to eradicate<br>extreme poverty because we're not<br>dealing with the underlying issues<br>defier Helen Tanaka attend our koto a<br>round of applause ladies and gentlemen<br>for our panel</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
