Thank You Victoria Victoria<br>leads the Ultor youth declaration<br>conference bringing together hundreds of<br>runner tehy to create youth declaration<br>create the youth declaration

about leading into<br>the future and having been involved in a<br>range of organizations and the youth<br>development space civic space and<br>different environmental organizations<br>I'm never too far from the phrase young<br>people are the leaders of tomorrow and<br>it's meant to be an empowering and<br>supportive phrase it the more I hear it<br>the more it sounds like an excuse an<br>excuse for to not let young people be<br>the leaders of today and in the context<br>of leading into the future I believe the<br>question is not how do we empower young<br>people to be the leaders of tomorrow but<br>how do we empower them to be the leaders<br>of today and meaningfully involve them<br>in our decision-making processes a young<br>leader I know<br>Freyja cook from Wellington she's 17 she<br>spoke about this in the speech at<br>apartment a few weeks ago saying that<br>because if we're the future we are not<br>of concern right now we are not of<br>importance right now and we are not<br>listen to to today<br>we don't live in a bubble for 18 years<br>of our lives unaffected by New Zealand's<br>issues and to we're able to have our<br>Democratic Stadium<br>we are not suffering from mental health<br>climate change and poverty and racism<br>and the future were suffering right now<br>rangatahi a passionate motivated and<br>eager to be involved in the decisions<br>that affect their lives and many are<br>already leaders in these areas my friend<br>Sophie is a very clear example and<br>there's leaders in the climate movements<br>leaders of the mental health movements<br>and in tino rangatiratanga they're not<br>waiting for permission to be a<br>decision-making table<br>they're not waiting to be invited to be<br>a part of those important discussions<br>affect their lives they are stepping up<br>and doing it themselves young people<br>want to have a say in their future and<br>it's incredibly important that they do<br>now not only strengthens the<br>decision-making process but strengthens<br>their outcomes but how do we empower our<br>Tahiti to be at that table and how do we<br>remove the barriers to allow them to be<br>there for the past three years I have<br>been leading the altered our youth<br>declaration conference whereas this year<br>we brought 350 detainee from across the<br>country for the conference in Auckland<br>and April where they spent four days<br>identifying the biggest issues in our<br>society and coming up with tangible<br>policy solutions to them creating the<br>youth declaration document and then in<br>similar to the people's report it's a<br>document outlining a youth vision for<br>all today an ideal world that these<br>young people want to live in and the<br>three core issues that they identified a<br>mental health climate change and<br>inequality and it's important to<br>understand the context to which young<br>people live in what it's like to be a<br>young person in 2019 to be a young<br>person the 21st century I found out<br>recently that the most lonely group in<br>our society are young people between 16<br>and 24 in an increasingly connected<br>world we are increasingly isolated from<br>each other so in leading into the future<br>how do we tackle these challenges<br>understand the context to which young<br>people live in we've grown up with the<br>existing actual crisis of climate change<br>and watched year after year our leaders<br>and global leaders do nothing we've<br>grown up in the mental health crisis<br>where does a defining characteristic of<br>our lives and we have grown up seeing<br>the increasing gaps between us<br>marginalizing our friends and oppressing<br>others young people have increasingly<br>complex complex complex lives and we<br>need a tailor our meaningful involvement<br>our inclusion to understand that data<br>need to be at that table but we also<br>need to understand how we can remove our<br>own barriers to bring India and we can<br>discuss that too<br>ask those had questions but we've got<br>some amazing rangatahi on the panel so<br>please use this as an opportunity to<br>take notes and really take some<br>information forward not just learning<br>but actually having like the step by<br>step process as to how you can improve<br>your engagement with like a time Jordan<br>Thank You Enoch way Victoria corner to<br>knocking knock i know hawky do me a<br>teeny tamata it's our privilege and our<br>pleasure to invite Kate Boylan we're<br>Mira Danny cobblestone and Tom McCall<br>Ormsby Jewish Suqian and father Andrew<br>Lisa<br>and we will read their BIOS because<br>these fellows are just awesome so it's<br>necessary for us to hear of their<br>brilliance Kate as a sustainability<br>engineer at Tonkin &amp; Taylor and was<br>recently named future thinker of the<br>year by the New Zealand Green Building<br>Council she is a member of the social<br>engineering advisory team and founder of<br> of the car cardi key team to<br>encourage colleagues to be more<br>conscious of beer impact on the<br>environment<br>Kate sits on the board of the now crowd<br>a young professionals network for<br>entrepreneurs who want to drive positive<br>change within their organizations she<br>also runs a social media challenge<br>channel called Kiwi gal says reduce<br>aimed at educating family friends and<br>followers about how to lead a<br>kyaa to everyone I want to start off<br>with a quick confession I think I might<br>have an obsession with hats I have a<br>bunch of different ones sometimes I feel<br>like I'm drawn to them I just happen<br>upon them or they find me like I'm a hat<br>magnet<br>I guess one could say that these are the<br>hats that got me here today my name is<br>Kate Boylan and I am a sustainability<br>engineer at Tonkin &amp; Taylor I am also a<br>minimizing waste advocate well as my<br>friends would lovingly describe me as a<br>tree hugger hippie<br>the annoying flatmate who always makes<br>me compost or eco warrior princess that<br>last one is my favorite<br>those names might sound mocking but I<br>know that deep deep down that they know<br>what I preach is important and I know<br>they're learning and making changes I<br>graduated from the University of<br>Auckland in 2015 with an honours of<br>mechanical engineering I worked as a<br>mechanical services engineer in the<br>building industry for a few years before<br>making the leap to a career that aligns<br>more closely with my personal values and<br>passions I work on a range of projects<br>for them Tonkin and Taylor across the<br>broad spectrum of sustainability and<br>resilience earlier this year as<br>mentioned I was lucky enough to be named<br>the New Zealand Green Building Council<br>future thinker of the year so thank you<br>as always to the Green Building Council<br>for the honour and for giving me such an<br>amazing platform today I feel so<br>privileged to be on such a bright<br>diverse and talented panel to be honest<br>when I was doing my background research<br>or stalking who's judging and to my<br>fellow change making panelists I felt<br>incredibly humbled the goal of this<br>session is to explore how we can empower<br>strong youth voices and I think this<br>panel itself is a brilliant step in the<br>right direction we must give voices<br>these voices at platform after all it is<br>diversity and its inclusion last week I<br>was in a similar position representing<br>the youth voice at the Espeon conference<br>about the end of plastics as we know it<br>and in this team there were some high<br>school students just 13 and 14 years old<br>thinking and working alongside them I<br>realized that even their perspective was<br>often in complete contrast to my own<br>some could call it naivety inexperience<br>or ignorant but I thought it was<br>profound they were brave enough to ask<br>those seemingly silly questions and<br>challenged the status quo that even<br>after a few years in the industry I had<br>become accustomed and complacent to we<br>must give those voices a platform I<br>recently heard about a company who has<br>one position on the board specifically<br>for a millennial or someone from the<br>younger generation of their workforce<br>this role could help challenge those<br>ingrained old ways of doing things and<br>all the common excuses used to not do<br>things by bringing a fresh perspective<br>to the table perhaps this should be an<br>idea adopted by more businesses moving<br>forward after all its diversity and its<br>inclusion one of the first questions<br>asked and the panel's today was what can<br>our dönitz how he do to help and the<br>response was do something simple but<br>perfect I agree that we have a huge role<br>in communicating and advocating for the<br>SDGs following that recommendation and<br>you're going to roll your eyes and call<br>me a minute Melanie or here but I put up<br>a poll on my social media page asking my<br>followers if they knew what the SDGs<br>were thinking they awkward and I'm<br>currently sitting at 50% so I know I've<br>got some work to do social media gets a<br>bad rep but I think it should instead be<br>utilized as the incredible communication<br>tool it has the power to be let's use it<br>as a tool for good at Alfred raising<br>called positive change every day I am<br>motivated and committed to creating a<br>better more sustainable planet for the<br>sake of humankind and future generations<br>because we do not have another option I<br>am motivated and committed because I<br>believe this is a challenge that we can<br>rise up to and soul together Nami<br>we thought it a good idea to read their<br>buyers as we call each of them to the<br>podium just so you can have

probably<br>say whatever translation for that<br>afterwards well we shall see ten are<br>called word gives me much pleasure to<br>welcome following Wayne Miller Danny and<br>Tom Walker Dewey who was a litigation<br>lawyer by day and a climate activists by<br>night after project managing a relief<br>mission in the aftermath of super<br>typhoon at the super typhoon in the<br>Philippines do we started working on<br>disaster management climate policy and<br>grassroots campaigning as she<br>facilitated academic research published<br>by policy briefs participating at the<br>United Nations Framework Convention on<br>Climate Change COP negotiations solve<br>premium electric vehicles via Tesla and<br>campaigned for zero carbon bill of the<br>zero-carbon bill through generation zero<br>as a young lawyer and activist she is<br>passionate about using her legal skills<br>to properly enforce New Zealand's<br>kumusta Kayon lahat Chiara my name is<br>Dewey as Jeremy said I am a litigation<br>lawyer by day and I climbed activist by<br>night it's a very long day and night<br>just by the way I personally started<br>working on climate change in 2013 after<br>super typhoon Haiyan hit my home country<br>the Philippines to me there is no doubt<br>that the root cause of more frequent<br>freak disasters like high n is climate<br>change from that immersion I realized<br>that once you know there is something<br>wrong then you are responsible to make<br>it right once again once you know there<br>is a wrong you are responsible to make<br>it right so as a young climate activists<br>what baffled me when I attended the UN<br>climate talks was that decision-makers<br>and key stakeholders in the private<br>sector knew and still know that<br>something radical needs to be done to<br>tackle the climate crisis that we now<br>face and yet there seemed to be no<br>systemic framework to get climate action<br>happening in New Zealand so like me I<br>think that most young people in the room<br>are motivated by our deep need to do the<br>right thing I mean this is why we're<br>here right even those who are young at<br>heart for us it's in our core to bridge<br>a gap that is so obviously wrong and in<br>New Zealand's context that was the lack<br>of this strategy on how we are going to<br>address climate change so in order to<br>get work done<br>our generation had to think of what had<br>been done in the past the limitations of<br>what we can do in the present and how<br>far we need to extend that to ensure<br>that intergenerational equity is ensured<br>for future generations this is why I'm<br>eternally grateful to the young people<br>in generation zero who got to work and<br>lobbied for the zero carbon bill in 2016<br>I'm so thankful because without the<br>long-term lens of the zero carbon bill<br>we run the risk of ineffective policies<br>and decisions that per your<br>cost avoidance in the short-term<br>generations zero took ownership of what<br>our future is going to be like we<br>campaigned for the solutions that we<br>need and became the critical friend to<br>all the members of Parliament's and<br>business partners that we need to work<br>with to have a safe climate future we<br>believe that our generation can fix it<br>SDG 13 challenges us to make climate<br>change essential focus and all policy<br>decisions that we make that's because<br>there is no turning back as the G 13 is<br>also connected to many other goals like<br>clean energy and life on land and on<br>water to name a few<br>this means that it's important that we<br>consolidate and collaborate all of our<br>efforts to maximize the change that we<br>need to make are for our future we<br>recognize the value of working in all<br>levels this is because all levels of<br>society must complement one another to<br>make structural change so for generation<br>zero we focus on leveraging laws and<br>policies to create a thriving future and<br>affect structural change so for example<br>in the international level we committed<br>to the Paris agreement and the scg's but<br>are we really walking the talk on<br>everything that we promised more<br>importantly are we including Rana tahi<br>in the decision-making process we<br>recognize the need for long attack just<br>have a seat in the table to represent<br>the youths views otherwise how are we<br>supposed to know our place in the world<br>how can we know that we have the<br>potential to be leaders in addressing<br>climate change if we truly want to do<br>right by out on that sake then we need<br>to overhaul the system we need to<br>rethink the policies and practices that<br>jeopardize our future this is why<br>generation zeros national campaign<br>introduces direction certainty and<br>accountability to New Zealand's climate<br>strategy more importantly it will also<br>drive a fair and cost-effective<br>transition towards a resilient zero<br>carbon future one of my most favorite<br>quotes from my activist friends is to<br>think globally and act<br>and we have a tremendous amount of<br>opportunities to act on the local level<br>and even on the school level um I think<br>that most of the students in the room<br>will agree with me when I say this<br>because I know that if you want to<br>change the world then you have to start<br>in your schools my work as an activist<br>has introduced me to many wonderful and<br>youthful souls who are keen to walk the<br>talk I mean like literally and for<br>example I once helped the student Lobby<br>the bishop to start some recycling in<br>their school and the bishop then helped<br>the students Lobby the senior leadership<br>management sorry<br>senior management leadership to then get<br>some work done so the students that I've<br>worked with and mentored are some of the<br>most passionate and if we really want to<br>invest in their future then we need to<br>invest and empower our youth so my<br>challenge for everyone here to close is<br>to be a homey to all of our youth<br>whether you're a professional you're a<br>teacher you're a local councillor or<br>whether you're auntie Helen be a home<br>eat or youth homey is an ally who is<br>ready to walk with our youth side by<br>side homie is someone who recognizes the<br>in justices that we see the inequitable<br>future that we will face if we don't get<br>our act together and more importantly a<br>homie is a conduit who will help enable<br>the positive change that are allowing<br>it's how he need only in being a homie<br>can we recognize and empower the leaders<br>of our future thank you<br>enough where Joey Paolo injurious Valley<br>Andrew Lissa and he is a policy<br>consultant at the Asia Development Bank<br>Ann represents Altair or on

important that I highlight<br>the unique vulnerabilities of small<br>island developing states in the South<br>Pacific growing up in a remote village<br>in samah I saw firsthand just how<br>quickly the climate was changing our<br>fishermen were bringing in fewer fish<br>our water supplies were diminishing and<br>our farmers were growing crops at a<br>slower level than previously the<br>sustainable development agenda is a<br>matter of life and death for societies<br>like this it's community we don't have<br>the choice to do something or to do<br>nothing our islands are literally<br>sinking New Zealand became one of the<br>first countries to accept a climate<br>refugee because for us our very lively<br>hoods are embedded in the climate and in<br>the island of our societies it's rooted<br>in who we are as a people it's embedded<br>deeply in our DNA there is no choice<br>when it comes to climate change for<br>Pacific people which makes it rather<br>because we are least responsible for<br>climate change and yet we are also the<br>least resilient when it comes to<br>managing the effects of climate change<br>because of our size and because of our<br>geographical isolation and so I call on<br>countries like New Zealand and Australia<br>to act as leaders for the small island<br>developing states in the Pacific who<br>can't stand for themselves who simply<br>don't have the knowledge and the<br>resources to do it on their own as<br>leaders in the South Pacific it is<br>imperative that New Zealand acts for<br>these small islands on their behalf with<br>them together<br>antonio guterres un secretary-general<br>said that you know the small island<br>developing states are at the heart and<br>soul of our sustainable development<br>agenda and you know I'm the only Pacific<br>person on the agenda today there tells<br>us that we're not doing enough for<br>Pacific people and our livelihoods we're<br>not doing enough as leaders to show the<br>world that the Pacific is fighting and<br>that the Pacific is surviving someone<br>said earlier that Auckland is the<br>Polynesian capital of the world that<br>Salman is the second most spoken<br>language in Tamaki Makaurau after<br>English but what does that mean if we're<br>not leading in the climate justice<br>narrative if we're not defending the<br>small islands that can't defend<br>themselves on their own the future<br>belongs to the Pacific and it's survival<br>depends on it but the successful failure<br>of this agenda depends on the engagement<br>of Maori and Polynesian people on the<br>engagement of Asian New Zealanders these<br>are the youngest demographics in the<br>country but they're also the<br>fastest-growing demographics in the<br>country if we leave these groups behind<br>we won't achieve the goals in time<br>ladies and gentlemen these islands are<br>sinking and jacinta adarand said that<br>climate change was the defining moment<br>of our generation but it's up to us to<br>decide whether climate change is also<br>the defining moment of our country in<br>the global<br>now it could be the nuclear free<br>movement campaign of our generation<br>young people are rejecting meat on a<br>scale never seen before you know it's<br>serious when a fat Salman is telling<br>people that to eat meat is no longer<br>good for the planet young people are<br>using public transport and a scooters<br>because we prefer that to private cars<br>we're turning away from shopping malls<br>we're turning away from big homes and<br>appliances that we simply don't need you<br>see ladies and gentleman young people<br>are already leading on the climate<br>change narrative and so it's about time<br>that we have access to policy to<br>research and to the spaces that are<br>conducive to political and economic<br>leadership I believe the key to the SDG<br>agenda is social transformation we need<br>to help those who need it the most we<br>need to engage those who are currently<br>engaged the least that ladies and<br>gentlemen is the key to succeeding in<br>the SDG agenda and I want to end with a<br>salmon song I'm not a singer by any<br>stretch of the imagination so please<br>bear with me as I attempt this pathetic<br>I'm honored to are my<br>noreda tena koutou tena koutou tena tato<br>couture<br>attend a photo a folly you said you're<br>not much of a singer but your your words<br>had much more of a profound effect on us<br>than any great song correct so thank you<br>very much<br>questions of the people so the very<br>first one<br>what does meaningful youth involvement<br>and consultation look like I'll start<br>with this because we've done a lot of<br>involvement in the consultation process<br>here in New Zealand particularly for<br>this era cabin bill so I think the core<br>of consultation itself is to actually<br>find out what their views are before the<br>decision happens and often what happens<br>is the opposite and so I think that<br>going back to the core of what<br>consultation is that is the main thing<br>that we need to be better at in Alti era<br>in terms of involving the use we can't<br>just say hey this is option a B or C<br>which one do you prefer<br>and that's consultation that's not it<br>before we even get to options a B to D<br>we need to have use involvement there<br>and so very simple include us in the<br>decision-making process before<br>consulting us on the decisions that are<br>made yeah I think it's just about having<br>that say at the table exactly what<br>you're saying but instead of coming to<br>you with the options and saying these<br>what we think what do you think more<br>having that voice at the table in the<br>first place so we can have a say to<br>begin with thanks I just want to say<br>quickly that like Jacinda our donors one<br>of the youngest leaders in the world and<br>to build on that we really do need to<br>kind of revolutionize the way that we<br>co.design with young people and so it's<br>about not just having us in the room and<br>at the table but actually co designing<br>policy and co designing programs and<br>service providers need to be able to<br>accept that that is the culture of the<br>future whether we like it or not young<br>people are changing the way we do<br>business and so we should be changing<br>the way that we do government as well<br>and so you see founders like you know<br>the founder of Facebook and the founder<br>of these young people that are<br>destroying traditional industries I sent<br>having an idea and so imagine the kind<br>of potential we would have if you had<br>young people in government on these<br>government boards designing policy with<br>the adults in the room together I think<br>that is the potential for young people<br>in decision-making listen to and<br>incorporated too often use consultation<br>as just tick boxes it's just a process<br>that you do to fulfill a requirement<br>that someone else has told you to do and<br>so when young people know that they<br>don't feel valued that's a huge huge<br>impact on their well-being but also<br>their ability to meaningfully contribute<br>to those discussions and their presence<br>needs to be valued I have a friend who<br>is on a board<br>she's the youth representative and she<br>manages an entire other youth group as<br>part of that board<br>she's the only board Myint but not paid<br>and so you need to value your youth<br>representatives as much as you do and<br>adult their contributions are just as<br>insightful just as relevant and that you<br>should respect that just as you expect<br>marvelously covered the the theme of a<br>number of the the higher questions<br>further up the up the poll here but um<br>helps this one and the least responsible<br>less resilient are most affected by<br>climate change but how can we ensure a<br>socially just transition away from<br>cheaper goods in energy that sounds like<br>a question for me what are the great<br>examples is tuvalu that has gone<br>completely off the grid when it comes to<br>energy and that's an example for the<br>rest of the Pacific to follow through<br>with you know this idea that we are<br>small enough to be radical in the way<br>that we embrace renewable energy and<br>that we could be an example to the rest<br>of the world simply by having the the<br>right kind of characteristics for<br>renewable energy to take off but what we<br>do need desperately is the international<br>invest<br>and so I think that that is the role<br>that Australia and New Zealand are<br>already playing and could be playing<br>going forward as well how to return oh<br>ho ma tomorrow mama Tina Marie Kyle<br>Cayetana Tok tiene una parte Hanoi to<br>Mauna Kea her tiene algo Tamati
