The Study has followed the lives of 1,037 babies since their births nearly 48 years ago in Dunedin looking at their health, development and behaviour. The Study is now in its fifth decade and has produced over 1,300 publications and reports, many of which have influenced or helped inform policy makers in New Zealand and overseas.<br><br><br>The

tenakue<br>and<br>members of the academic party tinakorua<br>Professor poulton tenakwe guests<br>colleagues members of the public and I<br>see very many many distinguished<br>visitors from afar welcome welcome and<br>Thrice welcome<br>um<br>this is a very<br>um wonderful occasion for us here at the<br>University of otago this year to<br>celebrate the award of our distinguished<br>research medal to Professor Richie<br>poulton my name is Richard Blakey I am<br>the deputy Vice Chancellor for research<br>and Enterprise and it's my great<br>pleasure to warmly welcome you all here<br>to it tonight for this event<br>as a celebration of the occasion we will<br>also invite you to join us for<br>refreshments and conversation at the<br>staff Club afterwards<br>now the order of proceedings is such<br>that I will try to say as little as<br>possible to let time be head for our our<br>pres our distinguished research middle<br>lecture and but we have Professor<br>poulton's head of Department Professor<br>Mike Colombo here to give a formal<br>introduction to the lecture<br>but as I cheer the panel that has the<br>hard job of deciding upon who should be<br>awarded the distinguished research medal<br>each year I'll firstly briefly introduce<br>introduce you to this award<br>our University regulations State simply<br>that the otago distinguished research<br>medal aims to give recognition to<br>outstanding performance of individual<br>researchers a medal commemorating the<br>ward will be presented to each recipient<br>I think we have that yep at a public<br>lecture given by the recipient<br>the basis for selection will be<br>outstanding scholarly achievement<br>including the discovery and<br>dissemination of new knowledge the<br>development of innovative technology or<br>the development of Concepts that lead to<br>significant advances in activities of<br>the University now usually at this point<br>in proceedings there would be an<br>indication of the area of um of<br>relevance of the awardee sometimes these<br>are very narrow disciplinaries even<br>though the achievements are very high<br>but I think in this case for the<br>audience and the making sense of Life<br>title for those of you who are not aware<br>of the<br>awesome and long-standing achievements<br>of Professor poulton and the studies<br>that he leaves I think you will leave<br>the room tonight with a very clear<br>understanding of that now it is a very<br>hard job making this award or deciding<br>upon the awardee because all of the<br>academic departments within our four<br>academic divisions are invited annually<br>to submit portfolios from their best and<br>brightest researcher or research team<br>and to help in that decision making we<br>solicit referees from the leading<br>researchers in their fields of endeavor<br>and then a group shared my by myself and<br>composed of former distinguished<br>research metal recipients has the<br>stimulating challenging and enviable<br>task of selecting the best of the best<br>from these nominations now what makes<br>this so special is that we we select a<br>very um<br>people into a very exclusive club and<br>unlike many major Awards even<br>International Awards up to including the<br>Nobel prizes which tend to focus within<br>a disciplinary disciplinary area our<br>distinguished research middle has to<br>identify and recognize Excellence across<br>disciplines<br>we also have to balance overall<br>career-long scholarly achievement with<br>discrete world-changing discoveries that<br>are often sufficient for other Awards so<br>putting the scale of the exercise in<br>context at the University of otago we<br>have approximately 1600 academic and<br>research staff and with only one of<br>these medals awarded annually since<br>2004. uh Richie's coming into an<br>exclusive club that has about 16 members<br>in it so that's about one percent of our<br>Academy<br>consider also that to be appointed into<br>an academical research position at the<br>University of<br>otago is also a highly selective<br>activity and we can typically get more<br>than 100 applicants for any one position<br>so that's another one percent selection<br>that one has to go to even to get into<br>the academy then even getting to the<br>level of a PhD that qualifies you to be<br>an applicant for a for a job is also<br>considered to be about another one<br>percent exercise although Dunedin being<br>New Zealand's smartest City I think we<br>have two or three percent of our<br>residents who have phds<br>even more special uh Richie was<br>recognized as by Thompson Reuters this<br>year as one of the New Zealand's top<br>researchers being in the top one percent<br>of most highly recited researchers in<br>this field so tonight we have<br>um a celebration for someone who is the<br>one percent of the one percent of the<br>one percent who has achieved a one<br>percent citation rate so um don't take<br>it don't let it go to your head too much<br>Richie the thing that I would ask you is<br>though Richie you give a hundred percent<br>tonight in your presentation with us<br>um and um I hope that you can dine out<br>at least once on the fact that you're<br>probably the smartest person in Dunedin<br>at least at least for tonight and we'll<br>recognize that and celebrate with that<br>celebrate with you tonight at The<br>Akinator so that's enough said from me I<br>will now invite Professor Colombo to<br>come forward and provide the formal<br>introduction<br>thank you very much<br>all right welcome everyone to the<br>distinguished research metal lecture by<br>Professor Richie poulton my name is Mike<br>Colombo I'm the head of the Department<br>of psychology where Richie resides as<br>Richard Blakey told you my task here<br>this evening is to introduce uh the<br>speaker and it is both a privilege and<br>an honor to do so so I've known Richie<br>for quite some time he became the<br>director of the Nadine<br>multi-disciplinary health and<br>developmental Research Unit also known<br>as the Dunedin study in 2000 taking over<br>from Phil Silva who started the study<br>back in 1972.<br>I think it's fair to say that handing<br>over the Dunedin study to a young senior<br>research fellow which is what Richie was<br>at the time was risky and it's probably<br>also fair to say that some thought he<br>would not succeed but succeed he did<br>the proof is in the pudding as they say<br>and since 2000 Richie has shepherded the<br>study to tremendous success the study is<br>taonga it is a National Treasure<br>now I'm going to say a few things that I<br>know Richie would prefer that I didn't<br>say<br>but he is after all the recipient of the<br>distinguished research medal so some of<br>this has to be said<br>so I wrote in my hod support letter back<br>in March of this year that he had then<br>269 referee Journal articles including<br>two papers in science seven in pnas<br>three in psychological science and three<br>in the Lancet he also has 24 chapters or<br>monograph an H index of 81 8 1 81 45<br>000 lifetime citations and 27 citation<br>classic papers which are papers with<br>more than 400 citations there's little<br>doubt that he is deserving of the<br>distinguished research medal his many<br>other medals and awards are no less<br>impressive and he does all this against<br>the backdrop of a tremendous service to<br>universities the director of the dean<br>study and to Country he is part-time<br>Chief science advisor to the Ministry of<br>like to hear about those statistics<br>not the type of person he is he's all<br>about the study and the impact the study<br>the impact the study has had is<br>widespread from being able to predict<br>adult measures of well-being from<br>childhood measures of self-control to<br>the effects of early cannabis use on<br>cognitive decline in adulthood from<br>uncovering the effects of Psychosocial<br>distress on telomeric erosion<br>and the pace of Aging to using<br>non-invasive procedures such as retinal<br>Imaging and processing speed to predict<br>the likelihood of schizophrenia and from<br>the ability to predict psychotic<br>episodes later in life from childhood<br>delusions and hallucinations to the<br>realization that young suicide<br>attemptors need follow-up care or else<br>they are more prone to negative life<br>outcomes the Nanine studies research is<br>of high theoretical value and it is<br>translational with implications for both<br>both practice and policy<br>but Richie is also more than about just<br>the study he is about family<br>his own family Sonia and Priyanka who<br>I'm sure are here tonight<br>also his Dunedin study family his<br>collaborators and researchers all over<br>the world as well as that amazing group<br>of collaborators and research just down<br>the road across from the stadium who<br>worked so hard to produce the amazing<br>research that has come out of this study<br>but he is also about another family and<br>that is the participants themselves the<br>1037 participants born between April<br>1972 and March 1973<br>of which in the most recent testing<br>phase 45 they are now 45 years old a<br>remarkable 94.1 percent of the living<br>cohort returned from all over the world<br>to again participate in days long<br>testing I have seen how much he cares<br>about these participants who have given<br>so much of their time they are part of<br>his family and that is really what<br>Richie is all about<br>would you please join me in welcoming to<br>give his distinguished research medal<br>talk the Dunedin study making sense of<br>Life Professor Richie poulton<br>foreign<br>this is one of the alternative stories<br>to my academic career every time I go<br>nearer<br>the Xerox machine or whatever it just<br>fuses and doesn't work so we're off now<br>um<br>in the manafinoa<br>eterno<br>there's a whakatoki that is going to<br>appear<br>above me<br>uh that was essentially gifted to me by<br>a friend tamati<br>and I think it nicely describes<br>the journey over the last quarter<br>Century for me at least<br>I read somewhere<br>and I asked Jane was this actually true<br>about three hours ago I read somewhere<br>that this was meant to be<br>a reflection of<br>the person honored in my case<br>it's a series of reflections over the<br>and the whakatoki I think captures quite<br>nicely<br>Martin<br>through resonance<br>through a feeling through some sort of<br>sense of the world<br>your brain takes it in and makes some<br>from that often derive some<br>understanding of nature<br>or the things that make up nature<br>and<br>if you work at things long enough<br>through that understanding comes<br>knowledge<br>and through knowledge maybe a smidge of<br>wisdom<br>comes a full life and a feeling of<br>well-being<br>this is how I feel tonight I am<br>I don't get nervous when I speak<br>publicly but I'm nervous now<br>and it's partly because I feel greatly<br>honored by a number of people who have<br>traveled a long distance to come<br>and listen tonight and many people from<br>Dunedin who've made the effort to come<br>out and listen so I hope it's a<br>if you were Brave give me some points<br>out of 10 at the end I'll take it on the<br>chin whatever it turns out to be so if<br>I'm going to talk about my life and my<br>academic career it really has to start I<br>think and I have given this some really<br>serious thought back at school back in<br>the school days and so I thought<br>um I would pay homage to both the<br>Headmaster and a teacher from a very<br>seminal School period for me in fact one<br>that one of the people I'm going to pay<br>homage to is actually in the room<br>uh<br>this is<br>this chip<br>for those that no he's not in the room<br>he's passed away this is Sir John Graham<br>he<br>I was the Headmaster of a school in<br>Auckland Lawton grammar school when I<br>attended in the late 70s<br>and I chose that particular picture of<br>the the web because that's not an<br>you can see the thought bubble right<br>oh my God what's Poland up to now<br>uh<br>but of course the Headmaster<br>of a school says the tone but of course<br>they are not the complete school and to<br>themselves it's made up of all the<br>teachers<br>and the particular teacher I'm talking<br>about you probably would recognize him<br>once his picture flicks up here<br>he was my fourth year master<br>as it was known as Becca Dalton grammar<br>he's a cherry sort of bloke who had a<br>passion for coaching rugby<br>and 42 years ago<br>he wrote something about me and I never<br>knew this<br>in fact I didn't know that Grandma did<br>this sort of thing until I turned up at<br>the school 150th Year celebration<br>in May this year and I was gifted this<br>little piece of paper that basically had<br>my value as a human being actually<br>what I'd achieved or not achieved I<br>don't know who can read that<br>the thing that I first was taken by was<br>my sixth form performance<br>the second one from the bottom<br>very mature boy<br>and of course the last entry<br>gives you a feeling of<br>um what I was about at that point right<br>I was a sportsman<br>but I had these very redeeming qualities<br>at least I thought they were redeeming<br>when I read it because my memory of me<br>back then was that I was a pretty grumpy<br>grumpy difficult<br>um character and I read this and I<br>thought whoever that was was a very nice<br>sounding person and a sportsman I wasn't<br>just a thug all right or a or a buff<br>head I was a sportsman who had mature<br>who has mature qualities of reflection<br>and compassion<br>I thought wow<br>that's all right<br>but what did Graham Henry write about me<br>that's the second from Top Line<br>gwh<br>um a boy who is determined to be<br>successful<br>participates well within and outside<br>classroom<br>reasonably prescient wouldn't you say<br>I was going to say profit it but it<br>sounds so much like pathetic I thought<br>I'd stay with her the presence<br>um so what did I learn at Auckland<br>Grandma why am I telling you this I<br>learned how to persevere<br>in the face of challenge<br>I learned to strive and work my guts out<br>I learned that pursuing Excellence was<br>an okay thing<br>uh and that one will never quite get<br>there but you need to keep striving<br>I didn't quite learn<br>um those things as I've just described<br>them when I was going through the place<br>um or it didn't it didn't seem that<br>that's what I was learning it's only<br>after quite a few years of reflection do<br>I realize that there are gratitude I owe<br>to that place<br>as was mentioned by Mike we have studied<br>among other things uh the relationship<br>between self-control<br>and later life outcomes and we've shown<br>quite clearly that Beyond The Usual<br>Suspects of that predict success IQ<br>socioeconomic background and the like<br>this thing called self-control<br>has a pervasive impact upon how well you<br>do down the track it'll determine<br>whether you end up as a healthy person<br>physically it'll determine whether<br>you're in good emotional shape and don't<br>suffer from mental health problems it'll<br>determine whether you end up in good<br>employment situations having achieved<br>academically at school and or<br>a post School it'll determine whether or<br>predict whether you'll end up in jail or<br>dependent upon benefits<br>it'll project whether you're a good<br>parent<br>will he display the warm sensitive<br>caring sort of parenting that is ideal<br>for human growth and development<br>it'll predict a whole bunch of things<br>and I think that's what they instilled<br>in me a bit of self-control<br>and for that I'm very very grateful so<br>having thanked my<br>um<br>my teachers now I need to move to the<br>people in a chronological order who has<br>had a direct bearing on my academic life<br>I've listed some people out because<br>their influence on me has been more<br>through multiple indirect channels via<br>Aloha various forms of support some<br>mentorship but these handful of people<br>have had a huge impact upon me over my<br>25-year academic career and uh I guess<br>partly responsible for me standing here<br>having become a one percent of one<br>percent you know that stuff<br>I like that by the way<br>thank you<br>the first person I want to thank is<br>Professor Terry that's her full name but<br>she became known as Timmy because her<br>father was Terry Timmy moffatt<br>um this is a pictured<br>the reason she is<br>in this part of the chronology because<br>she is without doubt one of the best<br>life course researchers in the world and<br>has taught me enormous amount about the<br>craft she is one of the best people at<br>making sense out of chaos it's not why<br>I've got you here though<br>it's because at that point I had a<br>friend a guy called Oliver Davidson who<br>was doing a PhD and I looked up to<br>Oliver he was three or four years ahead<br>of me and he was keen on becoming an<br>academic<br>and I thought he was cool but I couldn't<br>work out the there was so much<br>dissonance to resolve a cool guy wanting<br>to become a crusty old<br>po-faced academic I thought that was you<br>know the worst possible outcome at that<br>point I was going to become a clinician<br>and help people<br>I was going to um<br>at that point go to London and and save<br>people from mental health travail and<br>hurt and pain<br>and then Timmy was this unusual academic<br>because she was full of spitting them<br>vivacious she was exciting she was<br>naughty she was a reverend<br>um she had a bit of SASS and I liked<br>that and I thought at that point despite<br>having my you know<br>the ambivalence I've just described it's<br>quite Brave to describe that in this<br>kind of audience isn't it about becoming<br>an academic I thought maybe that's an<br>option and I just tucked it away anyway<br>I shot off to Europe and<br>um with very naive ideas about what my<br>life would be like there I was going to<br>base myself in London and to Europe<br>every three or four weeks and so on and<br>so forth I've never managed to get out<br>of you know tooting back<br>but Timmy really was an inspiration and<br>a door opener and then as time passed I<br>realized that I did want to um move into<br>the Academy I had to do a PhD and that's<br>when I<br>in Australia<br>oh by the way Timmy also had this really<br>gun research assistant now the sad thing<br>about this is that very few of you<br>realize who that is<br>I've had some rude comments about the um<br>the hairstyle in recent years there's a<br>lovely exhibition in Canterbury Museum<br>right now based on the one that was held<br>in toy to that had enormous numbers of<br>people through it several years back and<br>I can tell you that the set they have<br>made of the 1980s<br>living room because they're all living<br>rooms from different epochs different<br>decades<br>there are pictures all over the wall of<br>and just to retain my personal cred that<br>quickly once I'd finished this<br>particular role moved into a Joe<br>Strummer half Mohican<br>and I won't tell you where it went after<br>that anyway so she had the good sense to<br>hire me and introduce me to the Dunedin<br>study back in 1985 I left two of the<br>world found out I didn't want to be a<br>clinician forever went back to a guy<br>called Gavin Andrews who is my PhD<br>supervisor from 30 years ago he is here<br>um<br>in the audience he's a very special<br>personal friend<br>I was with him on Friday<br>when we celebrated the life of another<br>dear friend of mine Rob and his wife who<br>passed away last week Gavin is<br>indomitable in terms of spirit<br>he taught me and I'm glad I have this<br>picture here because he's got a hand on<br>a box with resilience written on it I<br>don't know if you can read it bloody<br>blah he taught me resilience<br>he's a tough man I mean you'll meet him<br>possibly tonight he's a genial old<br>fellow right well by God it's 30 years<br>ago he used to terrify people<br>and to survive under Andrew's tutelage<br>was a real Badge of um honor and I did<br>somehow and he taught me a lot of<br>important things far more than the usual<br>gift from a mentor to a mentee he is the<br>bravest academic I have ever met<br>there's a<br>expression from the Vietnam War in<br>particular of going at on point or being<br>on point when the soldiers used to go<br>out into the jungles on Expeditions some<br>poor schmuck had to be on the in the<br>front position<br>and I some I say that respectfully but<br>that meant you were the first person to<br>get blown to pieces<br>no one wanted to do it<br>you had to take your turn when your<br>number came up<br>but Gavin has always volunteered to be<br>on point<br>in Academia<br>so he's he taught me courage<br>he taught me<br>how to be resilient<br>and he's showing me over many years<br>since<br>um many variations on those two<br>important themes as well as being a<br>great friend so Gavin thanks mate for<br>being alive and being here tonight<br>Phil silver of course<br>um without him<br>none of us would be here talking about<br>the Dunedin study<br>this was a very unusual person<br>a Maverick in the truest sense Phil<br>he<br>was a a rugged<br>Southern Man<br>he valued the outdoors<br>he<br>got things done<br>he was the instantiation of this idea of<br>number eight wire which is sadly almost<br>dead these days new zealanders don't do<br>number eight why they do committees but<br>back in Phil's day<br>he was all about number eight wire<br>and he made this thing he built this<br>thing like out of a side of a mountain<br>but not by himself of course with the<br>help of many many people<br>but he was a kind of a quirk in the<br>medical school way back then he didn't<br>get a PhD until 1979 and the study had<br>been going almost<br>a decade<br>um<br>he locked horns with a number of people<br>and I remember vividly one day him<br>locking horns with me<br>um<br>he we didn't know this we'd been boiling<br>at each other all weekend we turned up<br>on Monday he called me into his office I<br>was his deputy director had been there<br>for a couple of years<br>uh<br>called me in and he was about to launch<br>on me and I had a whole bunch of<br>Grizzles to launch on him and he went<br>for 10 minutes and I said close it stop<br>please Phil<br>I have a series of gripes that are much<br>tougher and better than yours and so I<br>had the Talking Stick and I just went<br>for it 15 minutes later he said he<br>looked downcast and he said to me<br>oh<br>um<br>can you forgive me Richie<br>and I said I was so upset about it it<br>doesn't matter now it's all ancient<br>history I was so upset and I said I<br>don't know if I can Phil<br>and Phil looked quite shocked and said<br>I love this picture because it's<br>philosophered by some beautiful flowers<br>um thank you Phil<br>uh there's someone else I will mention<br>at the end as a very special person who<br>actually employed Phil Patricia<br>Buckfield I'll get to that later in the<br>in the discussion<br>so there's Phil<br>um there's EV kespie who is married to<br>Terry Moffett now EV uh is a kind of a<br>boy wonder this guy<br>um his English is his second language he<br>writes more beautifully than most people<br>I have ever met from within and without<br>Academia it's not that though<br>um that I want to highlight here it's a<br>gift that he gave me from the very<br>earliest days of knowing me and that is<br>the importance of methodology or good<br>method<br>this usually makes people glaze over but<br>I now and I don't exaggerate read<br>Journal articles or<br>other forms of academic publishing from<br>the method out<br>in other words if I read the method and<br>it's not up to scratch the rest is all<br>rubbish<br>right so everyone writes nice abstracts<br>a nice titles a nice introduction a nice<br>discussion points and they bury caveats<br>that is cautions but if the method's not<br>up to scratch it means absolutely<br>nothing<br>and EV has this ability to soar from the<br>minutiae of incredibly nuanced method<br>issues to the very big picture<br>and he's in full flight there teaching<br>it's a lovely picture<br>it's not from the same era as Timmy but<br>that is the the guy who's taught me<br>about the criticality of high quality<br>method it is much underestimated and<br>understood even within my area of<br>and because he was the director of the<br>Christchurch longitudinal study and you<br>may be thinking I'm about to<br>acknowledge the impact he's had on me as<br>a life course researcher<br>um yes a little bit but the people that<br>Timmy and EV<br>IL taught me a lot more<br>than just life course research<br>Dave is here he's a world-class<br>researcher he's here because he taught<br>me about purity of purpose<br>by that I mean<br>Dave and I remember this vividly one<br>night talking to me about why he did<br>what he did and he'd been doing it for<br>close on 40 years at that point and we'd<br>had a couple of wines we were enjoying<br>each other's company and he teared up<br>this is a gruffal guy<br>right he<br>went to sea at 16 he taught himself<br>academic<br>skill<br>tough as Nails very scary to many people<br>he teared up and he said I'd do it for<br>I don't do it for the baubles<br>medals although he is a previous<br>recipient<br>and I'm in good company as Richard has<br>said and I'm proud to be sitting there<br>with Dave<br>he didn't chase these things part of the<br>time it got himself he got himself in<br>all sorts of trouble he wished<br>desperately to be in the tent to be<br>helping kids because that's the only<br>reason he got up every day for 40 years<br>and did this Mahi right but he couldn't<br>help himself because he was so pure and<br>true to what he believed the truth was<br>they've had that sort of character which<br>is my way of the highway which has its<br>limitations<br>um but he impressed me greatly and<br>that's his legacy that he's passed on to<br>me and Mike has nailed me when he says<br>I'm about the people that participate in<br>this sort of thing and I'm about making<br>sure their gift<br>is used in such a way that it can help<br>others and I'll get to some of that<br>down the track<br>this is the guy many of you might<br>recognize<br>he has not had a<br>um direct impact upon my research<br>per se his impact has been more late in<br>the piece and he got me into the science<br>advice gig<br>and I see two of my lovely friends from<br>the science advice world in the audience<br>they are my two special line Managers<br>from my time five years now<br>going up every week to take the<br>knowledge that's generated by<br>hard<br>work in the research space into a place<br>where it might actually benefit people<br>into the policy making context<br>and Peter opened that<br>opportunity for me and I cannot conceive<br>of my academic life not having that part<br>in it now it would not make sense<br>anymore I'm getting old getting a bit<br>rigid I need that that is the lifeblood<br>of why I do what I do and this is the<br>one way I can do it by fusing these two<br>roles<br>in a way that I've got to thank my vice<br>Chancellor for<br>harleen because when I went to her five<br>years ago I said this is on offer I'd<br>love to do it will you support me and<br>harleen yes anyone knows he has no<br>pushover she said thanks Rich I<br>understand why you want to do this I<br>need to think about it<br>and then she said you go for it<br>but look after yourself<br>that's also harleen she cares about<br>people<br>finally<br>as I talk about the corporate gang my<br>friends from taranaki<br>uh there's a group that we have been<br>working with in the National Center for<br>life course research<br>for what is it close on<br>10 years seems like that but maybe not<br>Edwards and Dr mehi ratima these<br>wonderful people<br>accomplished academics some of whom are<br>on the path<br>have taught me a lot about what it is to<br>be a New Zealander<br>about<br>what communities<br>need as opposed to what either<br>academics think they need or people<br>well-meaning people in Wellington think<br>they need<br>and<br>I'm so enriched by this relationship<br>and I just feel incredibly lucky<br>that these things have happened and I'm<br>going to get to a little bit about what<br>other luck<br>has followed over time but I wanted to<br>touch on at least a little bit of<br>research and draw out a couple of kind<br>of or a single<br>behind the scenes observation about each<br>of the three things I'll discuss the<br>first issue and I've kind of kept it at<br>a high level it was because it's all<br>very Grand sounding<br>um you would be familiar with this idea<br>is it nature or is it nurture that makes<br>us who we are<br>we<br>um when the first person people to do<br>work demonstrating that was a<br>combination of the of both that was done<br>in more physical<br>Realms in terms of physical outcomes we<br>were the first though that provide a<br>convincing evidence in the behavioral<br>sciences<br>that it was not one or tether<br>it was the combination the marriage the<br>fusion of the two<br>that mattered the most now if you come<br>from a farm you would think that's<br>incredibly boring<br>because people have known on farms for<br>hundreds of years that if you plant<br>certain plants in certain environments<br>and treat them in a certain way I am I<br>environmental nurturing certain things<br>happen in certain ways and<br>don't in other ways<br>if you<br>'ve bred animals you know about this but<br>we were the first to show because of the<br>Dunedin study superb database on the<br>nurture side of that argument<br>not because of the fancy new genomic<br>stuff<br>um the human genome was sequenced in<br>2001 this first paper in this area came<br>out in 2002 one followed in 2003 and the<br>third one I'll tell you about in a<br>second in 2005. all showed the same<br>thing the genes by themselves trivial by<br>comparison to measuring subtle<br>environmental influences over many<br>decades genes by themselves told you<br>virtually nothing about who would end up<br>in the first paper<br>becoming violent as an adult having been<br>maltreated and abused as a child<br>it was an age-old puzzle up to that<br>point some kids who are maltreated grow<br>up to repeat the cycle others don't<br>we ask why<br>we thought it might be to do with<br>individual differences in genetic<br>endowment married to the environmental<br>exposure which was maltreatment<br>and we found yes<br>environmental exposure did Elevate the<br>risk a little bit for becoming a nasty<br>adult and maltreating others<br>the gene that we looked at the maoa gene<br>when I aiming oxidase a type Gene that<br>regulates some neurotransmitters in the<br>brain<br>um<br>related to dopamine serotonin and<br>noradrenaline so important<br>neurotransmitters<br>that Gene didn't tell us anything<br>specifically about who became<br>violent it was only the combination of<br>the two that is with a certain genotype<br>with a certain environmental risk<br>history you then were much more likely<br>to become a maltry to yourself now we<br>regarded that as just proof of principle<br>that these things called gender<br>environment interactions actually happen<br>in the behavioral sciences a lot of<br>geneticists have been working away in<br>this area for 30 odd years were very<br>pissed off with this because we were<br>Johnny come lately we were behavioral<br>scientists but we just read the<br>literature and thought this maoa Gene<br>looks like a prospect let's ever go<br>we did and we struck paid it and of<br>course you know your name's up in lights<br>and Science and and half the half that<br>genetic group said well that's fine got<br>to live with that but you won't do it<br>again in your lifetime and I'm very<br>smugly going to say that we did it in 10<br>months in the same journal and this time<br>it was about depression<br>and it was about the relationship<br>between lots of Life stress and some<br>people get depressed some don't some<br>just seem to sail on through<br>pretty much unscathed in fact some<br>people get stronger as a result of<br>adversity it seems<br>why well we suspected that a Gene<br>related to<br>the level of serotonin transporter<br>promoter that you have in your brain<br>might be involved found in fact that was<br>the case<br>if you had lots of Life stress and you<br>had a particular version of that Gene<br>that we called the vulnerability version<br>you were more likely to become depressed<br>have symptoms think of killing yourself<br>try and kill yourself<br>if you had the protective or resilient<br>version of that Gene you were no more<br>likely despite<br>experiencing or enduring a lot of bad<br>this is an interesting paper got picked<br>up by a publication in America and it<br>was regarded or described as the second<br>most important scientific breakthrough<br>of that year<br>and all branches of science<br>the winner was something to do with the<br>origins and structure of the universe so<br>very humbling to be in that<br>um<br>sort of space so to speak the<br>downside of course as you become a<br>Target<br>and this is a bit of the backstory so we<br>became a Target we did another paper<br>that was interesting um I was writing<br>about today for a publication on<br>cannabis use and negative consequences<br>that will hopefully help inform the<br>public next year when they have to front<br>up to a referendum<br>and in this paper we showed that the<br>relationship between smoking a lot of<br>dope or weed when you're an adolescent<br>and becoming psychotic<br>um was dependent upon which version of a<br>particular Gene you had called the compt<br>or catechol methyl transferase Gene<br>if you had the wrong version and only 25<br>percent of the population have that<br>version<br>and you smoked a lot of dope in<br>adolescence<br>when your brain is undergoing all sorts<br>of interesting changes it's particularly<br>sensitive then<br>your chances of becoming psychotic were<br>increased by a factor of 11. an 11-fold<br>increase he said hell that's a big<br>increase<br>but remember it's a quarter of a quarter<br>a quarter of the population smoked<br>cannabis in Middle adolescence and the<br>Accord of the population had this<br>version of that particular vulnerability<br>Gene<br>so today doubles the risk really at a<br>population level by a factor of about<br>two<br>so that's why people over the years have<br>said do you want to get Priyanka where<br>are you sweetie over there Priyanka<br>tested for the comp Gene<br>just in case and it's like oh I've told<br>her this stuff you know if she does<br>whatever she does that's her business at<br>least she she I've told her and as I<br>would advise any other parent tell your<br>child do not use substances in a um in<br>any sort of frequent way when your brain<br>is undergoing a lot of changes and<br>that's in adolescence<br>um just to show you I walk the talk as a<br>researcher once we looked at a lot of<br>cannabis use after the age of 18 the<br>effect washed away<br>completely went away<br>so it seems confined to that particular<br>stage of development<br>um the back story is yes we've been a<br>Target there's been all sorts of<br>meta-analyzes where you look at whether<br>this basic finding was true or not some<br>people have been scurrilous and left out<br>important pieces of the the data puzzle<br>or picture to have a crack<br>some people have been more balanced and<br>they write things like there is not<br>evidence for a strong effect<br>which is of course is really there's a<br>negative finding<br>the whole thing is so trivial<br>honestly who gives a toss about whether<br>that particular single Gene is related<br>to that particular outcome in the<br>context of this type of environmental<br>risk exposure because all we were doing<br>back then is providing proof of proof of<br>principle<br>these people need to get out a bit more<br>you know they get so fixated and so<br>angry with us and they want to tear us<br>down<br>I mean boring<br>um but it doesn't feel nice when you've<br>got the bullseye on you I've not had to<br>Bear the brunt Echelon kasby was the<br>first author in that series of papers<br>he's had to Bear the Brunt<br>um no one likes to be publicly ripped<br>the shreds in theory because we weren't<br>ripped the shreds we would have many<br>many counters but Academia is not a<br>every academic in the room knows this<br>and if you're not from Academia please<br>spare a thought for some of us Car Care<br>card-carrying nerds as we go about our<br>business<br>um<br>we're fighting for our ideas of course<br>but there's a little bit of skullduggery<br>always possible<br>so<br>I'm going to speed up a little bit the<br>second thing we looked at was the<br>classic old mind-body dualism psychosoma<br>Nexus can things from the social world<br>or psychological space<br>in your head<br>have impact upon the physical side of<br>your being<br>and the back story here<br>I'll cut to it is that absolutely it can<br>why this idea is caught hold in recent<br>decades it's because of studies that<br>Phil silver and Patricia Buckfield<br>started<br>because we have a multi-disciplinary<br>database and we've had high quality<br>individual Stand Out best in the world<br>programs of research oral health<br>from the physical end<br>social Behavioral Health<br>from the behavioral side<br>cardiovascular health sexual<br>reproductive Health cardiovascular<br>health on it goes and we are able to<br>marry these<br>high quality<br>usually just done by themselves programs<br>and research in our multi-disciplinary<br>database and ask and answer some<br>questions that haven't been asked and<br>answered before one paper in particular<br>was our sort of first big cable off the<br>rank where we said what about that male<br>treatment variable because that were<br>abused sexually abused were physically<br>abused were moved from clear to the Post<br>in terms of changes of parenting primary<br>parenting figure<br>how many address changes and so forth<br>what happened to their physiological<br>system<br>by the fourth negative life and we our<br>measure of inflammation was the key<br>outcome at that point inflammation is a<br>ubiquitous indicator of disease risk<br>and yes we found the first evidence<br>outside of a rat lab or a mouse model<br>for this existing and being strong and<br>able to withstand adjustment for a whole<br>bunch of other co-occurring risk factors<br>in childhood as well as adulthood<br>this is what we can do with a<br>multi-disciplinary database<br>now we wouldn't have had any that data<br>by the way if I hadn't had a great<br>colleague who joined the team to those<br>from Dunedin they'll know him Dr Michael<br>or Professor Michael Williams he was the<br>cardiologist I got on board because I<br>didn't know much about Cardiology and it<br>was left to me to fill that Gap when I<br>first arrived<br>so no one gives you this on a place<br>you've got to find yourself a niche and<br>you've got to work hard and make the<br>most of it this wasn't a comfortable<br>space for me I tell all the young ones<br>these days don't expect there to be a<br>life of no discomfort<br>that's preposterous<br>most of human existence has been marked<br>by extreme discomfort discomfort's okay<br>as Sir Ted Henry said during the World<br>Cup the All Blacks will be<br>themselves about now and I said why did<br>you say that Ted that was rude he said<br>oh no I'm just trying to tell the young<br>ones it's okay to be anxious<br>because everyone is scared of being<br>anxious for example today<br>very very true<br>he's still teaching you see after all<br>these years<br>so we were able to show that<br>psychological and social things do get<br>under the skin to cause physical damage<br>and rot and harm the final thing I'll<br>talk about is the Fountain of Youth we<br>have recast ourselves as a study of<br>Child Development into a study of adult<br>development and very memorably for me<br>about five years ago into a study of the<br>aging process everyone seemed to get it<br>that gave us comments back on the<br>application except there was a bit of a<br>a bit of a problem that I didn't<br>perceive lying ahead and that is<br>and so we had to endure a year of<br>extreme vulnerability<br>but we stuck to our guns and we put the<br>same application back in the following<br>year a very high risk strategy<br>but that's because we've got one more<br>bit of information to put in the<br>the application and that was that we<br>could tell you that our study members<br>who were all biologically age 38 we<br>could tell you how<br>um sorry chronologically they were age<br>38 how biologically old they were<br>and what did we find we found that<br>biologically our study members varied<br>enormously in terms of their biological<br>age some were as young as 28 some were<br>as old as 61.<br>all right now that's very important<br>because in the last century life<br>expectancy went up by two years for<br>every decade that passed but sadly the<br>good quality life only went up by half<br>of that in other words we don't want to<br>just extend lifespan<br>we want to extend health span<br>how do you do that you can't study<br>people when they're very old<br>you can study mice when they're very old<br>because they get old very quickly<br>because certainly human beings when<br>they're very old so you need to better<br>study young ones before they get too old<br>you need to better measure how<br>biologically old they are<br>and that's going to open up enormous<br>Vestas for us in terms of making the<br>science of gerontology which<br>traditionally has been about people 65<br>and above a science of life course<br>development<br>this is the my musings if I were to pass<br>on to a new director<br>I<br>there you are<br>I actually wrote in my little notebook I<br>thought the dirty dozen hints for tips<br>and tricks for young players and so I<br>say this with tongue-in-cheek mostly<br>um you do reflect on a number of things<br>over the a long period and so the first<br>one is something that<br>is quite liberating to realize that at<br>some point not all the time but at some<br>point everyone virtually<br>um to a person we'll think Jesus if that<br>was me I'd do it so I'd do it right you<br>know<br>um and so in the face of that you could<br>get down and feel a little undermined<br>and a little you know peeved um but for<br>me I processed in a sort of odd way I<br>thought cool<br>fine who gives a toss<br>um I'm just gonna not let that worry me<br>because in the end I'm the only person<br>that knows what it's like apart from<br>Phil to sit on the director's chair<br>a lot of people have no idea what you're<br>doing they see one little slice of it<br>and that's not because they are silly or<br>whatever it's just because that's the<br>nature of things<br>fear the dusters and roosters you all<br>know that that expression right so um<br>yeah no the the pressure of being in the<br>direction of the study in 2015 when we<br>got knocked back from HRC the funding<br>that was um non-trivial<br>um I got a lot more gray<br>um<br>I think it was a surprise to many people<br>it was a surprise to me too I've got to<br>say because I thought the science was<br>Bloody good and it got rated in the top<br>five percent in the American agency that<br>assessed the same application because we<br>always put in multiple applications in<br>different places so it was anomalous at<br>one level and one could Grizzle about<br>that<br>and say well something unfair or you<br>know this is not right you know oh it's<br>like so what I come from the old school<br>once a Gavin Andrews kind of thing don't<br>explain don't complain get even in other<br>words put your chin out take it on the<br>on the end and just buckle down and have<br>another crack<br>because at some point or another<br>you're gonna have to cop it in a country<br>like New Zealand where no matter how<br>good you think your stuff is<br>um there are a lot of other good players<br>out there and your number's up<br>um so<br>um I don't see such a distinction<br>between a bit of feather dusting and a<br>rooster I see them as being in a dynamic<br>state of equilibrium or disequilibrium<br>because it goes round and round and<br>round and you've got to take the good<br>with the bad<br>um I can tell you and I'm sure anyone<br>that's ever managed anything that people<br>have perceived as being of value that<br>the public face people present to the<br>world is quite discordant<br>to the private face<br>um<br>anyone that's dealt with money in the<br>money world will know this<br>I'm not talking snouts and trough<br>Behavior that's pretty you know whatever<br>subtle<br>things<br>um<br>so to my successor who that might be by<br>the way if I if I last as long as Gavin<br>Andrews I work this out he he's looked<br>the same age 60 since I know I've known<br>him he retired two years ago at 86.<br>um if so if I worked for another 30<br>years<br>um and in fact that makes me early<br>mid-career<br>there's a few people out there groaning<br>at the prospect I'm sure so this this<br>thing called the directors and invest<br>productivity law who can guess what that<br>is it's pretty straightforward right<br>those that moan and give you grief<br>all the time by far the least productive<br>we all make allowances for people that<br>are in area giving us grief so long as<br>they're productive<br>all right but there's and you know what<br>then you know what the correlation is<br>it's like so many other correlations in<br>the Dunedin study<br>probably about 0.3 to 0.4 not a huge<br>effect size that means I'm not casting<br>aspersions about everyone who's ever<br>grizzled<br>it's a relatively weak effect so I'm<br>going to get off the hook there<br>but I'll tell you what it's been true<br>over a long period<br>um now this is my wife's plug<br>I have always had a instinctive belief<br>that being subtle not hurting people's<br>feelings not slamming them between the<br>eyes<br>um not rubbing their face in it was<br>probably A Better Way Forward<br>and for years Sandia said you're far too<br>subtle<br>all right why don't you just tell the<br>person what they need to do<br>actually that sounds a reasonable<br>approach doesn't it<br>um and<br>where it gets a bit funny is like you<br>know you need to tell them what they<br>need to do because they're not doing<br>that right and you have to explain to<br>them why what they're doing is not right<br>and without offending and hurting their<br>feelings<br>um so I for a long time we've gone for<br>subtlety<br>so to anyone wanting to do this thing<br>for a long period of time don't be<br>subtle<br>I'm working on it still<br>I love this quote from Kissinger and<br>that talks about the capricious nature<br>of academic politics<br>um clearly I live my life in this space<br>so I don't see it as<br>as concrete or as black and white as<br>that but I can tell you that what I've<br>learned is that people spend a lot of<br>amount of time and energy<br>arguing and bitching and carrying on<br>about stuff that just does not matter<br>you see people die in a ditch for a<br>smidgen of data that they think they<br>deserve and someone else doesn't deserve<br>when you're actually stand back and look<br>at the amount of data that's available<br>Untouched by human thought that could be<br>worked up in a nice Publications and<br>therefore Fame<br>you've got to go employ this is not a<br>very rational place this academic kind<br>of set up<br>and again I'm sure I'm saying nothing<br>new to those that have managed<br>um<br>things in the<br>Academy<br>it is good to remind young players what<br>they're getting into now this is<br>something I really believe in listen<br>hard early on I did this instinctively<br>so when I came out of Gavin's unit I<br>realized that I was very privileged to<br>have it privileged to have a PhD and<br>that I virtually knew zilch that<br>mattered<br>I knew about<br>because I come from a Clinical Research<br>Unit into a life course context and the<br>best thing I could do was to listen<br>really well because I was lucky enough<br>as a senior research fellow<br>um you know<br>um<br>what if howling called me a man boy at<br>one point that was the discussion over<br>in Psychology which is my natural home<br>but I was over in the medical school for<br>many years<br>um<br>I just understandably knew that I should<br>shut up and listen and learn<br>because really smart people around me<br>and that's how I roll with it now again<br>going back to my wife sorry about the<br>sweetheart she says I lack that skill a<br>lot these days<br>and she doesn't seem to buy the argument<br>that I have to be seen to be<br>knowledgeable<br>I get paid for that sort of so of course<br>I know everything about something that I<br>vaguely know something about<br>um and so I that is an admonishment to<br>me<br>once you get Beyond a certain point of<br>course you don't believe the hype you<br>should never do that that's why you have<br>a good family instead of friends around<br>that bring you down to earth the whole<br>time but try and listen harder<br>in other words be relaxed about not<br>always knowing the answer<br>that's a bit of wisdom actually a bit of<br>the whakatoki the letter end of it<br>um go with that<br>um very simply don't ever get seduced by<br>the flavor of the month it's usually<br>rubbish<br>um of course be skeptical about<br>conventional wisdom or Dogma if you want<br>to root into<br>what might be going on always go back to<br>method<br>so many things and in life are repeated<br>gossip has never virtually never<br>beneficent but gossip gets repeated the<br>whole time as fact<br>um sadly<br>uh I believe any of that rubbish but<br>don't also believe because this has<br>always been the case it's a truism it's<br>um see for yourself<br>I think there's a bit of a disease<br>creeping in these days you see for<br>yourself thing that worked when I was<br>young go and look in the dictionary for<br>the for the meaning of a word<br>no longer flies because people can get<br>on that device and go<br>Google says it's X and they generalize<br>so the old the old-fashioned idea of<br>doing the hard yards and going right<br>back through for example when I arrived<br>Phil said read every publication we've<br>I can only picture what young ones would<br>say if I said that to them when they<br>um to their detriment<br>and one of the things that infuriates me<br>the most these days is when people say<br>can you tell us this will tell us that<br>we'll give us this or give us that and I<br>say why haven't you read the most basic<br>documents from the from the study you've<br>got the privilege of working in this<br>place why don't you just do a little bit<br>of work to try and justify that<br>privilege<br>The Road Less Traveled<br>um<br>yeah it was a sort of book wasn't it a<br>long time ago<br>um it's more exciting though<br>thinking for yourself<br>trying things out being brave<br>um<br>I've ever pick who knows the lunig<br>cartoonist from Australia anyone here a<br>few a few there's a few hands lovely<br>there's things about ducks<br>and I've got a lovely learner to picture<br>in my head when I wrote this which is a<br>whole lot of ducks that are wobbling<br>towards the cliff Edge and in one lone<br>duck looking sad going off in another<br>Direction I always want to be the lonely<br>duck<br>um be a bit humble of course but learn<br>from the wonderful gift that mistakes<br>are<br>and it takes a bit of guts and sometimes<br>it takes time so I've screwed up<br>um at times without doubt and I've tried<br>very hard to learn from those<br>experiences and be better for it<br>um<br>make sure you share those learning<br>experiences with others because then<br>they will learn that it's okay to stuff<br>up and they will learn not to react to<br>that impulse to conceal because on a<br>highly competitive environment no one<br>wants to appear not super good<br>but that's a nonsense that's a fraud<br>it's a lie and results and research<br>stuff happening that shouldn't this has<br>a telling element people will conceal<br>things as a pattern of behavior they<br>might conceal false findings<br>or inaccuracies or they might do<br>something because they don't want to get<br>in trouble that results in far worse<br>outcomes the old Stitch in Time says<br>nine stuff and people my last Point are<br>both more stupid and more brilliant than<br>you most people give them credit for<br>um<br>I tell you what number of academic<br>colleagues or use that term very Loosely<br>who have believed their own hype and<br>they've thought that everyone around<br>um how they were trying to pull the wool<br>over<br>uh<br>and of course people have seen right<br>through them<br>uh if you go down that path you will<br>lose<br>and of course people are stupider than<br>you think sometimes because they don't<br>know what you're asking them and where<br>this is a shot at myself because I will<br>sometimes say why couldn't this be done<br>this way and I realized that well I know<br>that way because I've been doing it for<br>bloody ever<br>things I'm most proud of who can relate<br>okay and it really was a situation where<br>I was<br>um<br>terrified I think of not living up to<br>expectations the bar had been set so<br>high<br>the Dunedin study was famous for a<br>number of things including the retention<br>by 26<br>age 26 assessment that was the last one<br>that Phil ran and I was sort of sitting<br>in in the writing shotgun with him<br>during that learning the ropes<br>they we manage the week I can own that<br>um 96 of the living cohort was seen<br>that's what I'm when I'm first up to bet<br>by myself everyone's going to see you<br>know<br>if I don't get anywhere near that figure<br>um poulton's hope it's<br>and you live with that of course you do<br>you know anyone that's performed in any<br>way had to perform you just live with<br>those things but I was doubly terrified<br>because not many people know this but<br>not long after I arrived in 1995 and<br>took up a role of deputy director to<br>fill the health research Council of the<br>day did a site visit and they came down<br>to Dunedin and the agenda really was as<br>rumor headed at that time and then<br>confirmed to me subsequently to close us<br>down<br>we had our Clips to our half-life<br>we're a good child development study<br>there was this little naughty me there<br>that they thought actually before we<br>close it down he may you know he's he's<br>five minutes out of the PHD oven<br>but maybe we should just hold five on<br>this or hold fire and give them a chance<br>um so the stakes were high in my head<br>really high<br>and there's so many ways you can mess it<br>up there are so many moving Parts in a<br>study like this over such a long period<br>of time<br>and I'm thankful that whatever mistakes<br>I've made have not been mortal<br>to the to the good or the well-being of<br>the study<br>um I'm really proud of the second point<br>which is honoring this core commitment<br>the social contract as I I see it with<br>our study members they give so much of<br>themselves they come from wherever they<br>are in the world they are asked a<br>thousand intrusive questions we poke and<br>prod measure everything under the sun<br>and they do it with Equanimity and Grace<br>because they think quite simply they<br>will help others in other words they<br>believe that we as researchers will do<br>something sensible with what we find out<br>that is made possible by their gift<br>and so<br>the science of you get the science<br>advice side of it for me now because I<br>can now hand on heart say to these<br>people I went to Wellington and I talked<br>to certain people and they said that's<br>really interesting Richie thank you<br>we'll take that into account and I've<br>actually seen a few things traced<br>through<br>um that I know can be attributed to what<br>just a Dunedin study but we're part of<br>it<br>and that to me is incredibly important<br>sitting in Academia writing papers for<br>your colleagues<br>and going to conferences with your tiny<br>group of like-minded colleagues around<br>the world<br>and getting the odd medal<br>is not really the best way of repaying<br>the taxpayer investment in what is a<br>very privileged career<br>let alone honoring why these people come<br>give us so much and have done for so<br>long so that is the Cornerstone for me I<br>sleep very well at night about that it<br>was born borne out for me how important<br>that has been to the study members<br>because I asked a few of them last year<br>beginning this year last year about<br>their attitudes to data sharing their<br>information being shared with others<br>because there's a Zeitgeist of belief<br>around spread it around give it to<br>whoever will get more for our investment<br>and in the discussion it became very<br>clear of how much trust they have had in<br>the Research Unit because I said well if<br>you tell us to do it we'll do it so no<br>that's not the point at all<br>you have to tell me what you want to do<br>but we trust you Richie we know you and<br>it was Uncle Phil before that<br>um<br>go away if you're a bit reflective as I<br>can be from time to time but that was<br>like an enormous thing what I just heard<br>and<br>I'm so<br>proud that they were able to say that to<br>me because they had seen<br>us do this over and it's not just me<br>it's the whole team seeing us do this<br>over such a long period of time to honor<br>what they give us growing the study it<br>was yes Paul I've just told you<br>something that it was sort of on very<br>shaky ground and over my tenure it has<br>gone from<br>strength the strength that Whoopsie<br>Daisy strength to strength<br>and it's got bigger so we have multiple<br>Generations now in this in the study we<br>have the main cohort but we have<br>information on mums and dads and<br>relatives 8 000 family members in the<br>family of origin we have studies now<br>going led by Bob hancocks of the next<br>Generations the first study started a<br>long time ago of the firstborn<br>three-year-old who want to understand<br>do you reap what you say when you're<br>parenting in other words we know how our<br>study members were parented we want to<br>understand whether they did good or not<br>so good parenting on their own children<br>and so we used to see the firstborn<br>three-year-old home<br>with their parent and they've extended<br>that to the age 15 year olds all of them<br>we've gone broader in terms of a<br>multi-disciplinarity we now leverage off<br>new technologies so this time around we<br>did pictures of eyeballs at the back and<br>that will tell us about the nerve layer<br>thickness and if you have less layers of<br>nerve that might tell you something<br>about your risk of developing a<br>neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's<br>whatever<br>we have always done a corset of things<br>but we have done those very deeply and<br>well for a long period of time the one I<br>like the most is the oral health<br>program research led by Murray Thompson<br>sitting here and taken over recently by<br>Jonathan Broadbent teeth are fantastic<br>they're very easy to measure accurately<br>and they get really into the measurement<br>these Dental people but gums<br>missing tooth that's not hard to pick is<br>it<br>um but they are<br>you know is the oral cavity an indicator<br>of overall health<br>that's the big question<br>I walk and I see study members when they<br>come back and I they smile at me and I<br>think well on the biological age measure<br>you'll be 60.<br>and so that workers that empirical<br>work's being done to show just that<br>so you know I think the studies growing<br>nicely and<br>um the the faith the the commitment the<br>trust is still there and in the end<br>that's what I'm um<br>what comes to mind if I'm thinking about<br>things that I feel genuinely proud of<br>no particular paper<br>doors have opened for me how am I going<br>time-wise by the way<br>um<br>right so I have been honored or lucky<br>enough to get into all sorts of<br>interesting spots over time and my first<br>governance experience was on HRC<br>the two<br>esteemed gentlemen that were the chair<br>in the deputy chair here Graham Fraser<br>John Hay thank you so much guys for<br>coming<br>the experience in these sort of contexts<br>are invaluable for you in both your<br>working life but also more generally to<br>understand how the world actually works<br>I never quite understood how little I<br>knew about the how the world works<br>um having one of the most steep learning<br>cures was getting into a governance<br>situation that was in with a group that<br>Colin James who's here was the chair of<br>called Motu<br>and it was an economic group of smart<br>people<br>world-class economists<br>I've had lovely experience in the NGO<br>world<br>the group that I have just had a ball<br>with the wise group and the two<br>Chief executives are here Jackie and<br>Julie<br>uh<br>it is a alternative version of the world<br>as we'd like to see it<br>the wise group has worked under the<br>radar 30 years anniversary this year<br>there'll be a lovely book produced<br>they've just been doing the Mahi quietly<br>over that period of time you'll hear<br>more about them I think is inevitable<br>it's turned into a very big operation<br>um but you go into a into this place and<br>there's a different vibe<br>the different there's a clear statement<br>of values<br>um then I've seen in most organizations<br>and the walking of the talk is very very<br>effective<br>uh and that has been a compliment and an<br>inspiration to me<br>um I get to go around all sorts of<br>interesting communities I was in<br>whangarei last week I was in South<br>Auckland<br>um the week before<br>I get to see people doing the best they<br>can for their whanau in those contexts<br>I do a bit of charity work<br>and certain is part of that effort for<br>the plunket I cheer the Plunkett<br>Foundation we try and raise money for<br>Plunkett to do Innovative things because<br>it is hamstrung by the government<br>contract<br>right it can only do what it can do and<br>the government doesn't have money to<br>burn<br>so they are doing sausage sizzles and<br>that sort of thing but we're different<br>from<br>no I was trying to get to Paris and I<br>was an Amsterdam and some French pilot<br>didn't take off because they had the<br>myth you were told it's amazing how<br>Europeans just accept it and it's<br>self-evident well it's a French pilot of<br>course he didn't want to bother to take<br>off and come pick us up<br>um so we had to sleep in the airport<br>that night and we finally got to the<br>ambassador's office in Paris New Zealand<br>Ambassador at the time<br>um and um<br>I the two of us that were struggling had<br>to go into and have a shower and I went<br>into the into the residence uh very<br>pushed place and the prime minister of<br>the day Helen Clark had just stayed<br>there and so I thought I was pretty<br>nifty walking around naked in the room<br>sorry it's pretty big um but I was<br>strong to the bookcase and I looked at<br>him I was like whose booked by the same<br>guy Colin James and I thought bloody<br>hell<br>um you know colonists really held up as<br>a very special uh New Zealander as a<br>should be but that's kind of like flying<br>our flag in Paris major city around the<br>world so I don't know if I've ever told<br>you that column anyway<br>um the people's homes and hearts when we<br>did the TV series people came out of the<br>out of the woodwork and came up to me in<br>airports and coffee bars and said thank<br>you so much for doing that and they<br>would tell me their personal story<br>just a quick download minute and a half<br>of something in their life that was<br>important to them very touching<br>and hopefully that can that kind of<br>experience can be parlayed by me into a<br>different sort of science book that I<br>need to write in the next couple of<br>years about what it's like to be a human<br>being doing research on human beings not<br>so<br>narrow is the usual end to science<br>advice of course<br>boy it's tough to make changes in the<br>real world though<br>this is a lovely book well worth a read<br>about how it's always been tough to make<br>big changes so my beliefs and what's<br>possible in terms of moving the status<br>quo they talk about changing the dial<br>have had to be modified a bit over time<br>and if you want to be in on the culpaper<br>for a decent period of time you've got<br>to be prepared to develop some scar<br>tissue in your thorough<br>simple as that<br>thrill of giving back are so many<br>wonderful things have happened<br>I've got to wind up I think so I'm going<br>to just go to mentioning a couple of<br>specific people<br>if any of those things on there strike<br>is at all interesting come and see me<br>over at the staff club and I'll tell you<br>about it if you talk to me for long<br>enough I'll get you to donate some money<br>to blanket as well<br>family and friends friends are<br>amazing I'm not going to single any out<br>at the moment I'm so humbled by everyone<br>that's come all this way to be here but<br>family I've gotta just mention the three<br>most important people who all happen to<br>be women given that my mentors were<br>mainly men some of you may have noticed<br>that<br>that's a bit of a thing these days I<br>don't know why but I'm not palestyle and<br>male am I really<br>um<br>well as mum<br>now that's us that's mum she looks like<br>the queen doesn't she that's 1965 in<br>Christchurch and I don't know where we<br>were going we're all dressed up there<br>wasn't much going on in Christchurch in<br>1965<br>um and that's me and so mum's told me<br>this lovely story about how she was very<br>keen I did well at school and maybe<br>something after that and she used to use<br>these big made out made up cardboard<br>cutout letters of the alphabet uh Glenn<br>Diamond had this idea that you could<br>teach people to you know read and talk<br>by doing this you know but come on say<br>but I'm on the high chair for God's sake<br>with pumpkin and all over<br>um anyway so there I'm about to go on<br>the rares with mum when I'm three years<br>old so mum thank you very much<br>um I won't say anything more<br>um you know how much I love you and how<br>much I value<br>um what you did in setting me up to<br>strive to do something useful in this<br>space that I find myself now<br>Sandia<br>this is me<br>um taking Sandia to the small<br>house I bought for us at mcandrew Bay<br>just above like Andrew Bay when I<br>married her in Sydney and brought her<br>back to Dunedin she cried all the way on<br>when she got up out of my Mona she cried<br>even more<br>and so I knew this I anticipated this<br>possibility and so I<br>um I I played a joke this is Atlantic<br>castle<br>and<br>through the tears that didn't seem to<br>work as well as I'd hoped it would but I<br>bought the small castle for us anyway<br>thank you sweetheart for giving up uh<br>your family in Australia to be here<br>five-year plans 25 years<br>um<br>you know what you mean to me<br>and then of course there's what happens<br>out of love as you<br>um<br>can have a family and I never understood<br>what the selflessness thing was all<br>about<br>until Priyanka was born<br>and funnily enough it's made me probably<br>better at doing the work I do now to<br>have become a less selfish person<br>uh and<br>it really is a unusual experience<br>feeling the degree of love you you do<br>when you have your child there's nothing<br>that can prepare you for it in your life<br>and I'm very proud that she's passed all<br>her exams this year<br>I won't talk about those marks but she<br>there's a lovely bit of footage here of<br>Pat Buckfield and it's never been or<br>hardly ever been seen before I can play<br>that and then I wind it up I like to do<br>that<br>head backfield<br>this afternoon looks at some aspects of<br>Early Child Development<br>perhaps dunedin's the glaze to have your<br>baby to give it a good start in life<br>with Little Help From a special program<br>at the Pediatrics Department of otava<br>University Medical School it's pat on<br>the left well it's and Phil silver on<br>and the idea originally was that we<br>would examine every baby who was born at<br>Queen Mary Hospital or who was admitted<br>here from country areas we had several<br>objectives<br>to collect information not just about<br>the sick babies but every baby in this<br>area and we have a rather unique<br>situation in Dunedin in that the babies<br>from the whole of the meaning city area<br>were born at this one hospital so we can<br>look at and through the cross-section of<br>the population<br>having examined today<br>so that's Patricia Buckfield she is<br>often lost or forgotten about him in the<br>discussions about the study were not her<br>beginning this study of perinatal Health<br>around 1968.<br>the study they would not have thought in<br>the early 70s to follow one group for a<br>short period of time it was meant to be<br>five years only<br>to see how they were doing compared to<br>the babies or the baby's born in adverse<br>circumstances how they were faring<br>compared to the counterparts who weren't<br>born at any of those circumstances so<br>she's an unsung hero Phil silver of<br>course is the obvious<br>founder I think of them two together<br>working beautifully to set up this<br>marvelous resource I'm not going to play<br>the next part I want to thank a couple<br>of colleagues very quickly because they<br>helped build the study<br>um<br>often prison particularly the people in<br>the first 10 years because most of our<br>biggest papers now<br>capitalized capitalize upon that first<br>10 years worth of data and Professor<br>Robert McGee John Langley and Sheila<br>Williams were absolutely seminal in<br>establishing this extraordinary resource<br>the University of otago what a great<br>home<br>you you I hope can detect my fondness<br>from my vice Chancellor Richard Blakey<br>and his four four runners have always<br>been really supportive of the Dunedin<br>study because that's their value work<br>the head of the department I've had for<br>the last five years has been the best<br>hitter Department I've ever had<br>we had a tough time getting across here<br>from medicine they they didn't want us<br>to come<br>and you need support when all hell<br>breaks loose and this guy is someone you<br>want in the trenches with you<br>the Dunedin Community helped build the<br>study<br>without them and their gifting of time<br>energy and just general support it would<br>not be what it is now and of course<br>funders<br>despite the odd Misfit if we didn't have<br>them we wouldn't be able to do the stuff<br>we love to do<br>finally<br>there's a study members<br>now this is<br>something that<br>was chosen on purpose it's all right I'm<br>going to turn that last thing off they<br>are faceless<br>but and it's not just the Thousand study<br>members it's their family and their<br>friends many thousands of people have<br>given a lot over the years<br>there<br>the forbearance<br>the reservoir of Goodwill is is<br>extraordinary I don't know if it'll ever<br>happen again in human history if we<br>started this today I don't know it would<br>be the same these people started when<br>New Zealand was God's Own user pay had<br>never been heard of and of course we've<br>nurtured that relationship and built it<br>carefully Through Time<br>but they do this because they they don't<br>get many rewards they just do it because<br>they think it helps others<br>just to give you a flavor of what that<br>involves<br>at our face 38 assessment a person who<br>is from outside of New Zealand that's<br>all I'll say when they receive the<br>Letter of Invitation to participate said<br>sorry Richie I can't do so I'm dying of<br>a brain tumor if you can manage to get<br>someone at a local<br>institution to be prepared to assess<br>certain things that I can do and are<br>happy enough to take my partner<br>to that place so he can support me I<br>then kind of counter to that this time<br>around<br>you know about P right methamphetamine<br>it's pretty heavily addicted<br>not many people putting themselves on an<br>extension program to get on a plane to<br>come from overseas somewhere<br>to put themselves through the hell of a<br>day when you're not using whatever your<br>chosen substance is in this case p to<br>give to the study<br>and nobody in your head you picture of a<br>pediatric as someone who doesn't give a<br> right that's all about the drugs<br>and they don't living on the margin this<br>was a person whose social conscious was<br>still well intact<br>and they put themselves through the<br>equivalent of living hell so they could<br>do this I've finished by saying the<br>thing I've learned about life<br>the meaning of it is that it's not the<br>usual<br>displays that are the most impressive<br>when we talk about resilience in our<br>academic world we talk about people that<br>have bad stuff happen yet they still<br>succeed and do well on all the typical<br>measures<br>I've seen many people who on the typical<br>measures don't do well<br>they don't have a superb job history<br>they don't they haven't got the best<br>mental health in the world they are<br>struggling but I can tell you what if<br>you knew their life stories<br>if you'd listen to their life stories<br>your ears would bleed<br>because they have soaked up so much<br>awfulness and adversity and the fact<br>that they can get up in the morning look<br>themselves in the mirror have a shower<br>get themselves over to the Research Unit<br>with it be it from<br>the Northern Hemisphere albeit from<br>South D is what I regard as true<br>resilience<br>and it's those small exchanges about<br>those sorts of things that I've had over<br>the over the years that have given me<br>more insight<br>than I ever expected as to what the<br>meaning of life is about I know that<br>science of course<br>but it's that special moment that<br>touches you<br>when the earthquake happened in<br>Christchurch I thought what can I do and<br>I thought I'm just right on my handload<br>card a handwritten card saying thinking<br>of you<br>the next assessment a person came who<br>received one of those cards I never knew<br>what happened once I'd done that<br>um I was up at Kiki and Ellie's place<br>and I saw the Carnage and that's what I<br>did when I got back small thought small<br>things<br>and at the end of the assessment day I<br>was coming out of our old building<br>coming down the stairs and this study<br>member was on the other side of the car<br>park saw me and started there and yelped<br>and started to run at me I thought oh<br> what's happened today<br>um and I froze I didn't know what to do<br>and she got about within a meter and<br>flung herself<br>upon me and this was hanging there and<br>started sobbing<br>sobbing and but between the subs I could<br>make it thank you thank you thank you<br>it's good whatever it is<br>um but what for and she said there was<br>and she could barely get it out but it<br>was the card it was the card it was the<br>card you didn't you had no idea of what<br>my life was like at that time it was way<br>worse than you could have ever imagined<br>and it meant everything to me<br>uh<br>that's the meaning of life thank you for<br>listening<br>foreign<br>let's imagine please accept it<br>I killed<br>um please bear with me for a moment we<br>now have our final formalities of the<br>evening it's my now my now my task and<br>my pleasurable duty to uh give a vote of<br>thanks to do some form of summing up on<br>making sense of life<br>um I would say I was thinking about this<br>and thinking are we going to hear the<br>meaning of life tonight and as a<br>physicist I was wondering if we would<br>really come to the answer being 42 but<br>we have not what we've learned is the is<br>that these mixes between nurture and<br>nature can affect so many things<br>particularly through people that have<br>suffered adversity that mind and body<br>are not separate and that in particular<br>for many of us those issues of aging and<br>adding to the health course rather than<br>the life courses something that's very<br>important but I think I I can reflect<br>that you have told us something Richie<br>uh that there may be a number that is<br>associated and perhaps it's according to<br>Sir Graham Henry that we get that the<br>meaning of life might not be 42 but it<br>might be 13 out of 38 as I think was<br>your position in the class in that<br>particular year but I think we've also<br>learned a number of things in it and I<br>was thinking and reflecting on a<br>whakatoki to to to to use in this<br>reflection and<br>um actually it it may not be a surprise<br>that it is the whakatoki that asks the<br>question<br>and come along with with me if you like<br>what is the most important thing in the<br>world<br>it is people it is people it is the<br>people and it is also that Reflection<br>from your school days that we have a<br>sportsman who has mature qualities of<br>reflection and compassion that we have<br>seen tonight and just finally in terms<br>of the reflection of the values and<br>attitudes that you've shown tonight that<br>I think makes it so fitting that you are<br>awarded the distinguished search middle<br>line and we'll ask the vice Chancellor<br>to come up in a moment to present it is<br>that you embody it's that you embody the<br>the motto of this University<br>dare to be wise dare to learn and also<br>the way that sometimes now I like to<br>flip it around that says not only dare<br>to be wise but it is wise to be daring<br>so with that if you join me in thanking<br>Richie again I will ask the vice<br>Chancellor that come and present you<br>with the 2019 distinguished research<br>thank you<br>thank you very much thank you and<br>medal decided by committee but forged<br>out of number eight wire for you Richie<br>so with that um please join me once<br>again in thanking Richie and join us in<br>the official party for some celebration<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
