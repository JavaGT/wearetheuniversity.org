week<br>which is a symbol of their peer but the<br>ruble my 5000 out here or the unique<br>context of of New Zealand within this<br>United Nations sustainable development<br>goals Co papa and of course first off<br>its footing for me to say that LT at all<br>represents New Zealand for for many of<br>the North Island nearly all of New<br>Zealand but ll cousins from the south so<br>there doesn't really accurately reflect<br>them so straight away that the ideas of<br>language and how we use language is<br>critically important and how we do these<br>things so internationally though we<br>recognize our TL or New Zealand as<br>standing for New Zealand ikuo nakamoto<br>mu ta wa kafa fatima no Kickapoo<br>tomorrow karate karate harper karate<br>maniapoto tue a quaternary Maturana waka<br>KO Harry Potter or automatic app wha<br>meteor kotinagulu<br>toquyen wa the courses the pp ha and it<br>seems to identify me to give up my<br>rivers and the mountains<br>I'm the river and the rivers me and so<br>on and so forth<br>and it reflects a Maori will view it<br>reflects that I am that River and that<br>rivers me I am that mountain in that<br>mountain is me and you'll note that I<br>said my name is danica door I didn't say<br>I am Danica door because I am all those<br>things that I mentioned before I<br>mentioned my name<br>and so notably although who have agency<br>I'm here today speaking to your wall as<br>an individual on the least important out<br>of all those other things they will<br>exist they existed before me they will<br>exist after I am gone but it is my<br>responsibility why I am here to ensure<br>that they do continue and ideally in a<br>better State that when I I came into<br>this world and so it's really important<br>as to introduce a relational way of<br>knowing and being which is the Mardy way<br>of how we understand and make sense of<br>the world<br>you know Intel Audi we say I belong<br>therefore I am which is of course in<br>contrast to I think therefore I am<br>but this is not about me of course today<br>rather it was just a message to serve to<br>introduce a Maori way of thinking it's<br>about these this is what's brought us<br>here today these aspirational goals<br>these targets for the world to meet and<br>just drawing out of some of the language<br>around the goals it says that they're a<br>blueprint to achieve a better and more<br>sustainable future for all and another<br>one that the goals interconnect and I<br>just drew out those two in particular<br>notes because I think they have a lot of<br>similarities with with Maori knowledge<br>and a Maori way of knowing so when we're<br>thinking about our tea at all in New<br>Zealand to occur Maori and what our<br>unique contribution is I posit to you<br>that it is matter of our Maori<br>it is our unique contribution and so now<br>this isn't a mistake this is El tiro New<br>Zealand according to a Maori way of<br>thinking because of course you wouldn't<br>have the fresh tecum are we worth<br>sitting on its head the whole time I<br>might get a headache rather we invert<br>the fish the right way up and so hefty<br>Kumar we the North Island and we have to<br>walk on Maui the South Island and of<br>course lucky order that the anchor stone<br>off of that Walker Matata memory is the<br>knowledge of the Maori people of<br>arterial New Zealand and as a continuum<br>of distinct knowledge with Polynesian<br>origins<br>that grew an LTR or including a Maori<br>worldview Maori values culture and<br>cultural practice and those perspectives<br>that established Mario identity<br>responsibilities and rights to manage<br>and use resources matter mobility is<br>understood within to our Maori our Maori<br>world view that has that its foundation<br>relationships between everything seen<br>and unseen humans and more than humans<br>the natural and the spirit worlds an<br>Internet shapes the Maori way of doing<br>things<br>mozzarella Marty is a system for<br>generating knowledge and all of the<br>knowledge generated using that system<br>and because everything is interconnected<br>and interdependent as was mentioned<br>earlier by our prime minister two cinder<br>are doing it's also a key underpinning<br>foundation of motto dunno it's also<br>really important that it's dynamic and<br>that it anticipates change and has<br>strategies to document change and<br>integrate that change into its systems<br>I've argued elsewhere that meant much<br>Mataram amaldi' was generated using the<br>scientific method but because it's<br>explained according to a Maori worldview<br>we posit that its motto down there as<br>well as science and not the other way<br>around<br>and while Macedonia and Maori knowledge<br>indeed is associated with its wonderful<br>rich oral traditions such as food Arco<br>the stories they're more Tia tea or the<br>chants Wyatt Earth songs audio audio<br>that the lullabies and so on lyrics it<br>also exists in material form and so I<br>use this this image of we were talking<br>funny nui from over to him RI in Matata<br>in the Bay of Plenty to demonstrate that<br>that knowledge doesn't isn't just in the<br>oral form the safari was built using<br>fundamental understandings of<br>architectural principles it was built<br>with materials that were the best<br>materials for that role with timbers<br>the outside that can withstand the the<br>conditions of New Zealand with knowledge<br>of a rope wall and an kiyow kiyow and<br>Haruki Kia for weaving the took we took<br>a panels and that was the knowledge of<br>the materials to use then we have the<br>beautiful folk idol that are carving to<br>those the patterns that exist undertook<br>otaku all of their forms of knowledge we<br>have the color schemes the ochre schemes<br>are both for for a doorman and for<br>beauty and also for practical purposes<br>of just preserving timbers<br>and whilst it's most likely that the<br>paint that is on these today is probably<br>from resines or what also some some<br>other thing those colors are all the<br>traditional colors that were used and we<br>can we can derive those ochres from<br>maybe some geothermal products or even<br>locally if we take some of the local<br>sand stones from the tucker point of<br>beaches or the st. elias cliffs and we<br>burn them we can get that beautiful red<br>so the point I'm making is that<br>mozzarella is material and has an all<br>nature to it and a critical point and I<br>think of note for the reason I'm here<br>today is to talk about the unique<br>context as there there are also other<br>knowledge systems out there and this<br>isn't a competition this isn't about<br>who's right and who's wrong about it<br>worldview says that we can all be right<br>because we have our own perspective on<br>things and so instead of having a<br>competition between whose knowledge<br>system is best and whose knowledge<br>system should be the most preferred<br>rather we would suggest that hey let's<br>have all knowledge systems contributing<br>towards realizing these sustainable<br>development goals because we just choose<br>to privilege certain forms of knowledge<br>we're not making the best use of those<br>amazing riches of knowledge that exist<br>so one form of motto donor one formally<br>are interested in a pod Arco and these<br>you might call stories that might have<br>been described as myths or legends but<br>describing them just as myth for legions<br>is inaccurate because these are codified<br>forms of knowledge that are designed to<br>make sense of Annex playing natural<br>phenomena that we see around the world<br>and around their environments but<br>explained according to a Maori worldview<br>a great example as the Tony Falco d'etat<br>he whom the local people was down by I'd<br>only did he pointed out to the transit<br>agency when they were looking for a<br>pathway for their motorway and they said<br>all we wouldn't put the motorway through<br>there that's where cutter tehy the Tony<br>file lives and for reasons that I don't<br>quite understand the the people in<br>charge listen to there and of course I<br>found out about it through headlines and<br>the newspapers saying you know crazy<br>mythical water creature costs ex payer<br>millions of dollars well you know they<br>listen to the people they shifted the<br>course of the motorway and then 14<br>months after completion massive flood<br>right in the area with Haruto he lived<br>probably would have if not destroyed it<br>would have significantly damaged parts<br>of the motorway now local people with<br>Connie Jane and the engineers said why<br>didn't you tell us you mean extreme<br>flood event<br>and they said well you didn't ask us we<br>told you that was with a tiny fire<br>resided it resides in other places along<br>the river so that's an example where I'm<br>still waiting for the headline that says<br>honey fire save taxpayer millions of<br>dollars but you're working on there and<br>another really important form of<br>knowledge is the madam otaku and this is<br>the frame of knowledge where Maori mark<br>time using the lunar calendar and with<br>their timing mechanism observations made<br>through generations through through<br>centuries of generations of of keen<br>observations of natural systems it<br>worked out when it was best to do<br>certain things at certain times and so<br>some of you may be familiar with the<br>madam attacker by the fishing calendar<br>when you - - or excellent fishing today<br>and so that's us let's go and maybe you<br>caught some fish and maybe you didn't<br>and if you didn't you might have been<br>hall high at the fishing Clarence's so<br>the motto Mitaka and the fishing<br>calendar are the same thing but what's<br>missing from that little thing in the<br>newspaper or where you might see it is<br>there today was an excellent day for<br>fishing for this particular species of<br>fish in this particular place in this<br>particular time of the day at this<br>particular part of the toyed using this<br>particular method and I can guarantee if<br>you'd followed all of these things you<br>would have caught fish through the moor<br>this knowledge is accurate because it<br>makes predictions that keep being proven<br>correct it is precise because every time<br>through the month or through the season<br>whatever the prediction might be you<br>prove your hypothesis correct it<br>maintains that precision through them<br>although this will be the first place<br>where we might start to see impacts of<br>climate change I heard from the esteemed<br>talk on that last week much already<br>after monkey ha that a particular flower<br>has flowered about a month earlier for<br>the last three years than it has since<br>it's been predicted through their motor<br>Mitaka<br>this could be an indicator of a climate<br>change impact we're not sure but the<br>first time it started flowering earlier<br>was the first time that was noted so the<br>madam attacker is a knowledge system<br>that can adjust as things happen and so<br>the madam attacker is also aligned here<br>in this poster to show and don't try and<br>read all the text it's far too far too<br>small<br>the main point I'm trying to make is<br>that it roughly aligns with the seasons<br>as we know them but it doesn't try and<br>predict or force things to happen at a<br>certain day like I believe yesterday was<br>the first day of spring hooray but no<br>one told my freesias and my Cocker beak<br>and my other flowers at home that as a<br>fist a spring yesterday I've been<br>flowering for months already and so the<br>motto maitake actually responds to the<br>signals within the environment not tries<br>to force them to happen at certain times<br>and one of the interesting things for<br>example about summer is there and the<br>gnatty fart or ki Kaipara murder might<br>occur a full summer will have seven<br>stages to it but not every summer needs<br>to have those stages just some of them<br>will so another important part of<br>mataram Amaury that I think is really<br>integral to understanding sustainable<br>development goals and how we achieve<br>them is quite yaki tundra now it's a<br>term that's appearing more frequently<br>and if I was forced to put into a single<br>word into English I would call it<br>guardianship but rather I would call it<br>the principle of intergenerational<br>sustainability and the practices we have<br>to do to deliver on that<br>intergenerational sustainability<br>undertaken within a Maori worldview so<br>what what that mean<br>katja katana expresses that we live as<br>part of the environment and the<br>principle over to generational<br>sustainability is realized by those<br>observations we make and determining the<br>practices we have to do to realize that<br>principle<br>increasingly we're recognizing that<br>science is a critical rate role to play<br>here too because we also recognize we<br>need to draw from all the knowledge<br>so these are some of the principles how<br>we actually seen some of these and our<br>legislation yes we have the 2d way to<br>act now which talks about 2d weirder as<br>having its own manner in its own MODY we<br>have to our two port act I'm sorry I<br>just got rid of the boring weird stuff I<br>think this is a bit a reflection of it<br>which talks about T or took well with a<br>woman new river is an indivisible and<br>living whole comprising the one a new<br>river from the mountains to the sea so<br>we've already got some of these ideas of<br>quite a ketone or a matter on appearing<br>in our legislation we also have to<br>minority wise part of the national<br>policy statement on freshwater<br>management talking about how we need to<br>look out for the environment and then<br>things will be okay for humans in the<br>end I've talked a little bit about some<br>earlier things so I'm going to skip over<br>these two slides really quickly but just<br>to say that this is a research project<br>I'm involved with it's inspired by my<br>toe donor and science to achieve better<br>outcomes by effectively trying to give<br>voice to our rivers and maybe it's<br>giving voice to our planet which is the<br>aspiration of the sustainable<br>development goals<br>so in closing I quote Sir Paul Reeves<br>from the Julito matter first of March<br>2005 we are geared wheat Maori toward<br>innovative and revolutionary thinking<br>and practical and sustainable health<br>solutions I also quite Tamati Kruger who<br>stated that the way forward is to draw<br>from old ways of knowing to establish<br>new ways of doing and so I believe that<br>we'll be free to say that there are very<br>few Maori groups who are motivated by<br>the UN SDGs<br>rather they are motivated by kaki Turner<br>however the outcomes would be exactly<br>the same and so for accelerated action<br>together I believe we are doing aspects<br>of that and perhaps we could do even<br>more if I wanted to be bold I'd suggest<br>that we would fuck'em on a puppet or no<br>coup and with Mother Earth Mother and<br>put it right into the constitutional<br>framework and critically enough key<br>relevance to this UN SDG summit and we<br>are all under<br>yes to this planet and so maybe this<br>could be the basis for the new kind of<br>globalization that Russell spoke about<br>not ADA kill to my Tartu<br>I cut jacket Aaron iturra<br>a den här equator tangata nuevo America<br>TANF archaic way Gary Tirupati aho Otto<br>to Pune now terrific over now rykor a<br>who attack he then my observation is<br>that you're not just a person you are at<br>an ephah yourself and you have that<br>ability have been omnipresent like a ton<br>Eva also dens one of the busiest Maori<br>scientists you'll ever see in the world<br>and like his ancestor the Tony Parker<br>Oota he believed he talked about he too<br>is going to save us a little bit of<br>money today because then we have a nice<br>certificate to express our gratitude to<br>you with and and and anomalies<br>certificate as well in the form of a<br>but just before we allow this great<br>tanning fire to escape and we all go and<br>have a cup of tea and a gossip just one<br>of the questions that popped up most<br>prominently by a slider was how do we<br>weave motto time amaldi into the SDGs<br>and Den's touched on a whole chunk of<br>that stuff but I wonder if he has any<br>further quarter or further commentary to<br>add to that or teen up we and quite<br>simply we just need to trust that it's a<br>knowledge system that is accurate and<br>precise and as rigorously generated and<br>if we can have trust in that system and<br>build upon those amazing things like tea<br>or took work like too early weirder and<br>like to mine or T or Y then that will be<br>the first step towards realizing it<br>Maori will do it themselves<br>and then we all can follow along and<br>kill the den I think I'm one of those<br>seven seasons of summer within Nazi<br>father might have began yesterday as I<br>was coming down through the heart of<br>Nazi father on the Kaipara Coast Highway<br>at about midday a whole lot of the<br>cousins were outside on the front lawn<br>having a few beers and a barbecue I'll<br>bring you some kiner's also later on to<br>apologize for the fact that we cut into<br>your session there we're about to break<br>for lunch ladies and gentlemen it was<br>morning tea sorry the wood pigeons will<br>be coming later on in the day but before<br>we do let's have a brief karakia in<br>keeping with our co papa
