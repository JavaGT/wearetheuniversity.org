our part time at the<br>tortilla Neda we come now to our second<br>panel session farno for Dominica more to<br>heart by your Kamui our panel discussion<br>taking action locally and collaborative<br>collaboratively and I see madam counsel<br>up any holes over there in the corner of<br>the lecture theater she'll be very<br>pleased with the way these East if<br>Achatz are being awarded wouldn't you<br>opinion yeah fantastic go West Auckland<br>and as a round resident I'm also<br>grateful here at 800 where Nora here<br>Chroniton Akito tot okay ho to attend a<br>100 totally a million aqaq way it a the<br>Keiko me here Mikey Mikey thought out<br>there 41 and council a penny host<br>represents the white arcade award on the<br>Auckland Council and as chair of the<br>environment and community committee<br>penny has 15 years of local government<br>experience including previous roles as<br>deputy mayor and chair of several<br>committees including healthy City<br>environmental management city<br>development and community and public<br>health<br>she served two terms on the way to Mata<br>District Health Board is currently a<br>director of the West Auckland trust<br>services and an elected member of the<br>Waitakere licensing trusts penny has<br>been instrumental and helping build the<br>West and cares passionately about the<br>Auckland region her special areas of<br>interest are climate change<br>sustainability city development<br>environmental advocacy human community<br>development and youth empowerment and I<br>invite period that penny to come forward<br>and share her address and in her role as<br>chair of our next panel session<br>I'll tell Ike where your decoder katoa<br>and thank you after that extraordinarily<br>long introduction I don't feel the need<br>to add anything and I always makes me a<br>bit shy when people google and come up<br>with that I need that will change I'll<br>be very brief we have such an<br>extraordinary array of speakers I don't<br>want to bite into their time our our<br>focus for for this segment is taking<br>action locally and collaboratively and I<br>think that without that we can't move<br>this whole cope up or forward I think it<br>becomes impossible<br>it's impossible without collaboration<br>the previous speaker one of the<br>Toki given at the end was an African<br> Toki and for me it's the driver<br>for everything I do it's the concept of<br>Ubuntu I am because we are and humanity<br>and collective humanity is the only<br>thing that will change us together so<br>very briefly we live in a time of<br>cynicism and dissatisfaction with<br>corporations and with political agencies<br>and leadership and people basically<br>don't trust leadership anymore nor do<br>they trust large organizations they<br>trust they trust themselves and they<br>trust the people that they spend time<br>with sadly they also trust social media<br>but that I'm sure will change so quite<br>rightly people are starting to question<br>those old beliefs simply that growth is<br>as good for growth's sake and that whole<br>picture of capitalism is starting to<br>change and that's good for the<br>development goals because community lead<br>process is starting to take over and<br>fill those voids community leads social<br>procurement initiatives are something<br>I'm passionate about and I really see<br>that starting to make a positive change<br>and the collective leadership from a<br>young people demanding change around<br>climate change you know have leaved<br>councils you know some of my Krusty's<br>around the council table actually<br>supported the call for a climate<br>change emergency and that was remarkable<br>it's what we do with that now that calls<br>but the issue is we did make that<br>collective decision and the rise in<br>social procurement and in social<br>collectivism is starting to lead to some<br>fantastic things happening here okay<br>ignore our Marty business collective<br>down south is getting some good business<br>from large organizations and from<br>councils because they are organizing<br>they're collecting and they putting at<br>the heart of their work sustainability<br>gender equity social cohesion and<br>everything that we want for that change<br>that's being talked about today<br>finally it is large organizations that<br>despite people's lack of trust in us are<br>the ones who can make change government<br>community and councils when they work<br>together in their collaboration out of<br>the place where that magic happens and<br>change takes place so we're very lucky<br>that we've got with us a wonderful group<br>who I think are going to explain that<br>and now I'm I also have to apologize to<br>my lovely audience<br>I do council meeting this morning so<br>haven't been here to see how people<br>start the process off we've got<br>timekeepers who are going to manage the<br>time I have my panel who some of whom I<br>know and I've had a chance to meet so<br>I'm presuming I just take over the chair<br>and I call them to join me can I just<br>check with our wonderful emcee is that<br>what we do I'm inclined to be bossy the<br>emcee will sort me out<br>so our curator and thank you for<br>listening to me the really big part now<br>is about to unfold with our fantastic<br>panel<br>killed a madam

killed up what a<br>remarkable panel and it's my huge<br>help and just while Ruth gets herself<br>seat up one of the the key things that I<br>know that is passionate about is the<br>public realm a healthy public realm<br>means a healthy community so cure<br>different they're not Coto cut or call<br>forth talking away if you write those<br>blues about yourself and send them off<br>on email and then somebody reads them<br>out and you go yeah it's really long and<br>roll it's a really great privilege to<br>speak here today thank you<br>manaphy know an artefact or for your<br>welcome and your guardianship of this<br>place I'd also like to acknowledge natty<br>power my trip when I landed here several<br>years ago after clearances in the<br>highlands and were given a safe home so<br>thank you our straight line at par new<br>crew development Auckland is shaping<br>spaces for Aucklanders to love and it's<br>been pointed out to us that we're the<br>only development agency that a<br>particular urban leader has found in the<br>world that has their l-word at the end<br>of their strap line and for my<br>department this is the but we really<br>care about trying to make places for<br>this city that we actually genuinely<br>feel that word for so we have a range of<br>places that we're working for in<br>Auckland the big red dots mean transform<br>which is a 20 to 25 year journey over a<br>long<br>of time big change for the area the<br>little green dots might mean one sight<br>and the blue dots are somewhere in<br>between unlocked locations<br>we're not deployed to do placemaking for<br>all of these places we go where we think<br>we can bring good change and work with<br>people on really meaningful lovable<br>change for that area which isn't always<br>possible but this place making word has<br>been with Pandu ku will actually with<br>the waterfront since 2011 and I was<br>ripped out of a theatre career and to<br>working for what became a very big live<br>stage down on that waterfront so this is<br>the waterfront and around about 2007 or<br>eights really well planned for the<br>dominant species on earth the private<br>car and really really important economic<br>driver for the city but the the<br>awareness that the council held a huge<br>amount of land ownership in the area<br>meant that we were able to deliver<br>something a bit different and this<br>opened in 2011 my food my first kind of<br>big outdoor event ever that I'd staged<br>in my life and a place that was built<br>around the public space first that was a<br>strategic decision put the public space<br>and make it something that people care<br>for and the private development will<br>follow put food and first that's the<br>thing that brings all of us human beings<br>together and placemaking is not a phrase<br>that is easily defined and I think that<br>should last for a very long time it's a<br>very widespread thing that deals with a<br>huge range of human behavior but this<br>for par noku isn't a bad definition for<br>it but the key point is that we work<br>together work together for the good of<br>place and it starts with a man called<br>William white in about the 1950s making<br>a film called the social life of small<br>urban spaces where he observed things<br>like this you kind of think to yourself<br>how come we need phrases like this just<br>pop out to Fanshawe Street and you will<br>know what I mean when I say a place not<br>designed for people and then Jane Jacobs<br>who I want to be when I grow up writing<br>the death and life of great American<br>cities and observing that what keeps<br>neighborhoods together she referred to<br>the ballet of the street so she famously<br>saved the Lower East Side of Manhattan<br>from getting a motorway shoved through<br>it by a man called Robert Moses<br>so it wasn't moderate mode with Moses by<br>himself but this idea that what keeps<br>our societies together other little<br>intricate mingling of human beings<br>you're awesome<br>is what us what keeps us together as a<br>society whose which has been seen so<br>well today by<br>all the speakers before me so by way of<br>example our and the West Thank You penny<br>we had the opportunity to put in a<br>temporary Greenway so we've worked with<br>Carcano who's an amazing local<br>collective that proves that the word<br>arts and career can actually belong<br>together in a sentence and gets young<br>people doing creative stuff and their<br>public spaces over in Northcote and<br>indeed the person we in Monaco we're<br>running a process called regenerative<br>practice which is quite an important<br>part of this puzzle working in to<br>greenways in the area to restore streams<br>restore streams not only so that they<br>don't flood and that they're healthy but<br>also that the local people know that<br>that's that's Tonga that they should<br>care for so as you've all said this<br>morning starting with the young people<br>and acknowledging just their enthusiasm<br>but then knowledge because they come<br>with us for free not last not least but<br>Monaco we have an award-winning civic<br>square which pretty much had nobody and<br>it's about three years ago that's a bit<br>of a gross overstatement but this is a<br>project designed by a group called Manu<br>tahi which is about 50 local<br>organisations who are working to program<br>that space for us as part of that<br>transform Monaco project this particular<br>piece is called pong as part of Matariki<br>were local students this person is 15 I<br>think half-caste laughs last laughs<br>crying dark night white night lullaby<br>woven flecks brown skies wrote haiku<br>format Siddiqui which were projected<br>onto the Civic building so to take it<br>back to my theatre career if we aren't<br>building these things with people in<br>mind who are we building them for or<br>what are we building them for and I<br>write down a final quote so I'd sound<br>smart to quote actually a man from the<br>biodiversity team and council we don't<br>need to think outside the box we need to<br>throw the Box away come Luca Moony as we<br>step further into this uncertain future<br>we need each other<br>we need new systems built on healthy<br>reciprocal relationships as we all sang<br>this morning we need love compassion and<br>thank you for I want to ask our our next<br>panelist to to join us with the<br>exceedingly I thought actually Rob I<br>should have checked on your title that<br>you want to be introduced by our we got<br>you your Longmire which is fantastic I'm<br>going to give you a title of business<br>with heart sustainability and auto heart<br>at the center so welcome hi I'm Robert<br>Kramer's director and owner of ApS a<br>multi trade property services company<br>founded in 1991 from an initial staff<br>number of two we have grown to a<br>medium-sized company now employing over<br>200 people Helen Clarke said earlier<br>don't bring us breech bring a plan up or<br>both so what can we do as contractors to<br>address social inequality and climate<br>change at ApS we believe we have a<br>social responsibility to support the<br>three communities we operate with them<br>firstly our own ApS community we look<br>after the health and well-being of our<br>employees by providing pathways for<br>career progression and all of our six<br>trades along with rigorous and house<br>training for Health and Safety regular<br>health screening and random drug testing<br>due to the high risk industry that we<br>work in mental health is supported<br>through the Employee Assistance Program<br>and we've had immediate take-up and<br>proof of a definite need health<br>insurance is provided for employees and<br>their families and the living wage is<br>paid as a minimum to entry-level<br>laborers with all other employees paid<br>in excess of that rate we actively<br>promote and encourage gender equality<br>and ethnic diversity with four of our<br>last six senior appointments revoke<br>promotions being female and there are 23<br>nationalities<br>presented at ABS tertiary scholarships<br>and sporting team sponsorships are<br>offered to employee children and we also<br>offer three-hour Bound courses a year<br>secondly our local community Tishri<br>scholarships are provided for up to nine<br>students per year from three low decile<br>Oakland High School's with the offer of<br>summer holiday work every six months a<br>Gideon ship is offered to herself<br>Oakland high school student with a<br>pathway to an apprenticeship in one of<br>our six trades recently we have aligned<br>with the panga project a charitable<br>trust that is focused on providing<br>opportunities for primary and<br>intermediate students and load the<br>assault self Auckland schools aps<br>support includes the gifting of a van<br>for transport and the offer of an aps<br>rewards program with emphasis on student<br>involvement and third our international<br>community with New Zealand red cross we<br>have provided an employment for three<br>former refugees and are currently taking<br>on a fourth which has been well received<br>through our APS APS also has an 18-year<br>relationship with child fund sponsoring<br>numerous children and funding a<br>considerable number of projects ranging<br>from school building construction to the<br>installation of water tanks and all<br>holes in six countries our environmental<br>initiatives to reduce our footprint<br>include improving efficient use of our<br>resources<br>and the minimization of landfill and<br>toxic waste through recycling and<br>partnership with green gorilla and<br>regime we are working with our suppliers<br>to eliminate the use of materials<br>containing read list read list chemicals<br>which are harmful to the users pollute<br>the environment and accumulate in the<br>food chain our co2 emissions for our<br>vehicle fleet will be reduced with the<br>transition to suitable hybrid and<br>eventually electric vehicles currently<br>we are working with environment to<br>determine our overall carbon footprint<br>with our gold three carbon zero by the<br>end of next year and double carbon<br>positive in five years<br>our handprint was a positive impact we<br>have on the environment includes for<br>conservation properties covering<br>forestry native Bush regeneration<br>re-establishment of wetlands and<br>intensive history education our most<br>recent addition is a large rural grazing<br>Block in rail remo which will provide<br>both recreational and training<br>facilities for ApS employees and their<br>families so what are the challenges that<br>we face as a contractor changing the<br>culture within our company is a<br>challenge but we did it 10 years ago<br>with health and safety and we now we can<br>do it again the attitudes outside the<br>company however are more difficult to<br>change from an industry perspective the<br>social and environmental message is<br>where health and safety message was 15<br>years ago<br>these initiatives all come at a cost and<br>we are very mindful that we need to<br>remain competitive to stay in business<br>there is a common client reaction nice<br>to have but we don't want to pay for it<br>because basically budgets that are took<br>our main driver so how can you as<br>clients help to push change in the<br>building industry you can engage<br>consultants who employ a sustainable<br>approach to a development and design<br>when selecting contractors and putting<br>works up to tender there needs to be<br>more emphasis on non-price attributes<br>including sustainability and social<br>equity consider negotiated contracts and<br>partnerships are socially and<br>environmentally focused contractors it<br>would be good to see sustainability<br>goals filter through our organizations<br>right down to the person responsible for<br>contract or appointments we believe the<br>current tendering practices need to be<br>changed if we want a better and more<br>sustainable future at APs and as Kiwis<br>we love our people we love New Zealand<br>and we love this amazing country that we<br>Thank You Robin just to remind people<br>that it's disruptors like ApS we've been<br>doing this for a long time we've paved<br>the way now for Downers Fulton Hogan<br>some of our huge companies to tender<br>differently and for big organizations<br>like Council with a five billion dollar<br>annual spend to actually contract those<br>companies think you killed a rock I'd<br>like to welcome Shaheen well warm<br>welcome as our Altair youth<br>representative and finding time to be an<br>advocate as you complete your Co joint<br>degree I think it's just an unbelievable<br>seat of skills that some of us could<br>hardly muster so welcome today's<br>generation of youth is the largest the<br>world has ever known<br>and a permanent and it presents us with<br>the unique opportunity to make a<br>difference community engagement is<br>predominantly being driven by youth in<br>many areas such as poverty alleviation<br>and the climate crisis as they have the<br>greatest exposure to these areas just<br>looking at Oakland City Mission the<br>Christmas lunch at five hundred and<br>fifty volunteers that creates a 2200<br>hours of service most of whom were given<br>by youth collective leadership through<br>the shared goals is becoming more and<br>more apparent but what is now needed is<br>momentum through community led<br>activities and empowerment to motivate<br>others to join the movement in order to<br>do this we need to make the scg's more<br>accessible through an easel and<br>implemented system that motivates cross<br>community collaboration having just<br>returned from the world's first Youth<br>Conference on kindness and how kindness<br>can be implemented in the scg's in New<br>Delhi it is clear that this is not a New<br>Zealand specific issue this is a global<br>issue the what we need is kindness<br>implemented into our policies to make<br>our scg's more accessible<br>but more people can understand them and<br>create use them to tie in the community<br>lead activities to a society built on<br>kindness mutual respect and tolerance<br>will provide with a strong foundation<br>for achieving the SDGs by 2030 and<br>encourage more people to join our<br>collaborative actions I'd like to end on<br>a quote never doubt that a small group<br>of thoughtful committed citizens can<br>change the world indeed it is the only<br>thing that ever has thank you it's one<br>of the best quotes to anyone who's<br>running out of energy and thinking why<br>am i bothering that's absolutely<br>something to hold in our hearts I think<br>that's such a good message that the the<br>Development Goals need to be made more<br>suits more accessible because so many<br>companies organizations and individuals<br>helping make those goals happen<br>we just need to name them until those<br>stories so thank you finally I want to<br>welcome a an extraordinary woman sana<br>who I meet when she was only I think<br>just a few

on leadership secondly partnering<br>for success and thirdly actions speak<br>louder than words and because we are all<br>on a time limit of five minutes I have<br>decided to put aside the script that I<br>was going to read from and really just<br>talk to you as I am now in terms of<br>leadership on Saturday I attended a<br>po'pay which is a Kingitanga Hui at<br>Fertile pakka mirai on the shores of the<br>monaco harbour and these particular we<br>happen on an annual basis within way<br>cottle but also in other places outside<br>our own groggy they are there to<br>acknowledge and recognize those of us<br>less fortunate but also an opportunity<br>for tribal members and others to talk<br>about other co papa that are important<br>to us as a nation as an e we when I got<br>up to speak and I am often invited to<br>and not just as a tribal member but<br>because they also chair why cattle Tony<br>our governance board but I spoke in my<br>day role which was as as has been<br>described by Counties Manukau DHB the<br>first thing I did though was to<br>acknowledge the leadership of the late<br>Kagame dame nanny called manic from<br>their particular area because Nanako was<br>a staunch passionate committed kaitiaki<br>of the monaco harbour and its<br>surrounding environment but not only<br>that she was also a leader and gave her<br>guidance and advice to<br>Counties Manukau our manaphy NOAA<br>partnership group and that is the reason<br>why I wanted to acknowledge you because<br>from a tower Maori perspective the<br>health and well-being of our people is<br>intimately linked to the health and<br>well-being of our natural environment we<br>have always thought like this and as I<br>was listening to our presenter earlier<br>keynote making these very points so I<br>wanted to acknowledge the leadership on<br>that particular day and I thought it was<br>appropriate to bring it here because if<br>you've ever been to that mud I you go<br>past some really beautiful homes in<br>carroca until you hit the dirt road that<br>takes you down to the mine the other<br>thing about that mud I - is that for<br>those of us that go there and I am one<br>that loves going there because there is<br>an abundance or part sake or flounder<br>and you can guarantee when you get there<br>you can have one flounder probably - all<br>of your own and you're not having to<br>compete with everyone else so there's<br>leadership acknowledging non-equal man<br>henyk here in Tamaki partnering for<br>success around has mentioned already to<br>TDT always honey that is absolutely<br>essential<br>from our perspective from Counties<br>Manukau it has integral it's essential<br>and critical in terms of addressing the<br>health inequity of our Maori population<br>the second highest Maori population of<br>any dhb across this country who I<br>thought was the first when we are<br>partnering the other manaphy know our<br>partnership group that works alongside<br>our board I also want to mention our<br>Pacifica community we serve the highest<br>specific Apapa<br>in the country and again we are<br>partnering with them on a number of<br>initiatives and one that I particularly<br>want to highlight is the health health<br>academies that we are partnering with<br>six schools and that we hope to increase<br>that throughout South Auckland finally I<br>want to touch on that action speaks<br>louder than words<br>and my colleague Debbie Wilson who is<br>with me today I just wanted to to<br>highlight what we are doing in the<br>energy space so we are ensuring that<br>when we are fitting out any new<br>buildings and I know that Middlemore<br>Counties Manukau is often high-profile<br>because we have certain buildings of<br>asbestos that are leaky and so on but we<br>are certainly committed to future<br>footing in future purposing our new<br>buildings designing out the need to use<br>gas in terms of waste we are actively<br>reducing waste to landfills we are<br>recycling what we can and actively<br>working down the waste hierarchy in<br>terms of our supply chain we are working<br>collaboratively across the region with<br>our other DHB partners and also with<br>Health Alliance can I close going back<br>to the faca Toki to the proverb that<br>overarching theme for the session which<br>is what I'm not only walking work keep<br>the heart by or Komori the most common<br>definition is there are those out the<br>front and there are those at the back<br>and the need to work together I think a<br>far richer meaning as one from would it<br>move<br>Typho has expressed in terms of<br>sustainability in survival the manner of<br>a group is dependent on the support and<br>guidance provided by a half a wall those<br>who follow are as vital to the journey<br>as those who lead hence the reason why I<br>mentioned arnica at the beginning and<br>coming up very shortly as some other eco<br>Maori warriors who are going to take us<br>forward and many of you will too<br>I just want to acknowledge the dimension<br>of Dame nanak or Pataca fear she would<br>be so proud to know that some of her<br>advocacy is now coming home to roost<br>the council has a very large sum of<br>money rate payers I'm sure you'll all<br>agree that this is a good thing of<br>several tens of millions over the next<br>10 years to bring mud I up to screech to<br>help them be more sustainable and<br>support their role as the absolute<br>fundamental centers of so many<br>communities and I think that's thanks to<br>her advocacy for them and I that you're<br>speaking of so and just like the po Chi<br>the the meeting that putti carefully<br>described we have those sitting on the<br>toe Mata and those who get to send fear<br>and trembling into them by asking them<br>some questions and your wonderful<br>enterprise what triggered or inspired<br>you personally to invest in SDG goals<br>and your company win as a contractor<br>these May when I was a boy growing up in<br>West Auckland in the seventies I lived<br>in a family that was a working-class<br>family both parents are working and my<br>father even had two sometimes three jobs<br>to get food on the table but we were<br>always loved we were always warm and I<br>also went to a school and I had advice<br>from my parents that we can do anything<br>in this country they came from a war<br>ravaged country they were immigrants<br>today we've got kids they don't even go<br>out of their suburb and they don't even<br>swim they haven't been to a beach<br>haven't even seen a cow or sheep these<br>things should be a birthright<br>Kiwi and this is our small way of trying<br>to correct it once drifted all the way<br>up to the top which some of you might or<br>all of you might indeed have some<br>thoughts around so you mean can we put<br>the Treaty of Waitangi at the center of<br>our SD jeez<br>do we need a government minister to hold<br>responsibility for the SDGs and feel<br>feel free to answer any part of that<br>I'll have a crack at it well first of<br>all there is a crown Marty Treaty a<br>relationship portfolio of which the<br>Honorable Calvin Davis as the Minister<br>for and I certainly think that that and<br>it is it does have a contemporary focus<br>to it but I think it's if you take it<br>more broadly it should be inclusive of<br>STG as well should we be putting it at<br>the center well for me that's a<br>no-brainer<br>yes just make a quick comment on the STG<br>calls and the fact that so many<br>organizations are actually helping put<br>the goals of direction we don't just I<br>think with my own counsel head on I<br>think that would be exceeding I was<br>lucky enough to be in Wellington last<br>year and I think the same question was<br>being asked I wonder about the fact that<br>we're all saying that not enough people<br>know if it there was a minister was this<br>attached to their portfolio people would<br>know everything else I want to say will<br>be a poor quote of Damian Salmond but<br>the notion of being able to hold to<br>ontological worldviews in this country<br>if we do partnership properly would be a<br>long way towards that system change<br>we're all talking about Kilda tato thank<br>you to penny for cheering our session<br>thank you for the the Grace and<br>diligence you brought in and fleshing<br>out
