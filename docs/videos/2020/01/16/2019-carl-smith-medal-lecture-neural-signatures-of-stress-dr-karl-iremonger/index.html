thrusts a wall in carlsmith<br>middle lecture to be presented by dr.<br>Kyle I'm anger of the department of<br>physiology my name is Richard Blakey I'm<br>the deputy Vice Chancellor for research<br>and Enterprise here at the University of<br>Otago and I'm here with an academic<br>that's the ones of us in the silly robes<br>consisting of associate professor Fiona<br>McDonald head of department and aqua<br>professor Vernon Ward Dean of biomedical<br>sciences tear narc way professor Paul<br>Brunton pro vice-chancellor Health<br>Sciences 10 our Quay DVCS professor pet<br>Craig and Helen Nicholson Tinoco Rua and<br>our Vice Chancellor professor Harlan<br>hain't in a coat tin are quite odd to<br>Milwaukee to photo 100 taco looking it's<br>my great pleasure to share the<br>celebration of outstanding research<br>achievement with you all friends and fan<br>out of our middle recipient members of<br>the university community citizens of<br>Dunedin and region and they may have<br>meet some representatives of the media<br>and know my HUD am I welcome and a<br>particularly warm welcome and greeting<br>go to Kyle's supporters and family who<br>you here tonight with greetings to<br>Kyle's mother and father Gail and Andrew<br>wife Joe and daughter Sylvia 10 our Kato<br>- you all look this is one of the most<br>enjoyable duties that I have to the<br>privileged to perform in my role every<br>year and it's really nice to be able to<br>do this in an official capacity tonight<br>although really what I'm interested in<br>as many of you are is to hear the<br>details of the talk tonight it's both a<br>ceremonial element but also professional<br>and academic stimulation for us now to<br>give you an idea of the way things that<br>will proceed tonight the order of<br>ceremonies is that I will say some words<br>and then invite an associate professor<br>McDonald to introduce the lecture<br>following the lecture I summarized the<br>significance and give a vote of thanks<br>and then provided those lecturers<br>suitably in prison I have warned Carl<br>this is a test as well we as a committee<br>decided the award but you as the public<br>should affirm that<br>we will present car with his awarded<br>middle and finally and then very<br>importantly we will retire to a<br>reception in the staff club for<br>refreshments and fellowship but first I<br>thought it's quite useful this is a<br>carlsmith middle and Rohith trust award<br>some background to the name of these<br>this medal and award the purpose of<br>these which began in 2003 and are always<br>awarded together so you can't get one<br>without the other it's very clear they<br>are to quote promote research at the<br>University of Otago and give recognition<br>to outstanding research performed of<br>early career staff which is for those<br>who have been at Otago for at least two<br>years but have a total research career<br>appointment of at least 10 years its<br>research experience and ages that is not<br>the defining factor so that 10 year<br>limit is what we use here to define our<br>early career research now this year we<br>had eight outstanding nominees who all<br>pretty much met the award criteria with<br>bells on and after much painful<br>deliberation we shall chose Cal as a<br>recipient what stood out to the<br>committee about Cole's nomination was<br>not just the major internationally<br>significant achievement he has already<br>made and move here about tonight in<br>amongst other things the discovery of a<br>new type of neural structure a lot of<br>called the dendron I as I understand<br>it's a hybrid between axons and<br>dendrites but as well as there it's the<br>breadth and depth of your contribution<br>to the understanding of the brain the<br>development and implementations of new<br>techniques here at Otago and your<br>outstanding acute communication<br>abilities that that led us to that<br>decision if you only will outline many<br>of your achievements I'm sure but what<br>really helped the case in addition to<br>the uniformly glowing referees reports<br>was the fact that you were awarded the<br>2014 prime minister's McDiarmid emergent<br>emerging scientists prize so if you've<br>got enough of the prime minister you are<br>you may be good enough for a target so<br>congratulations on that so enough sit on<br>that I think you get it but before I ask<br>Fiona to introduce you and a little bit<br>more about why a row heath trust award<br>and a carlsmith middle now one is for<br>the money in the others for the<br>Loree quite simply the Rohith trust<br>established in 1964 or was established<br>in 1964 to support the work of the<br>university by carl smith a prominent<br>Dunedin businessman and a member of the<br>University Council and it was used to<br>endow a $5,000 researcher port<br>support award that bears the trust name<br>so provided the audience agrees you will<br>or you may have already received their<br>financial inducement at the same time<br>the university commissioned a middle and<br>kyle's honor as the glory to accompany<br>the middle the money I'm sorry and so it<br>gives the University of very good<br>opportunity to recognize the<br>contribution so Cowell and his wife Lady<br>Catherine made over many years after<br>coming to New Zealand from the family<br>estate of Roe Heath in Birmingham the<br>family connection to the University and<br>the ward the award continues with Kyle's<br>daughter having lived in a Otago region<br>having been a regular attendee<br>at these awards up until very recently<br>and it was a real pleasure in the first<br>years of these awards to have to have<br>Katherine come and present the ward now<br>as well as the middle there's also a<br>very special little surprise as well<br>that socal was a well-known author in<br>addition to his business and community<br>contributions in addition to his book<br>sweet success the history of chocolate<br>maker<br>cadby Cadbury fry Hudson published in<br>1968 he was the managing director the<br>year he was also known for his quirky<br>and humorist home New Zealand from in to<br>Zed that has become somewhat of a<br>collector's piece and in fact I think<br>that we may have a copy of which to give<br>it to you tonight which is actually to<br>Gladys with best wishes from more than<br>1948 but we actually scour the<br>second-hand book shops to make this an<br>even more special presentation for you<br>so you can decide which is preferable<br>the money the middle or the or the book<br>so a company into the middle we have<br>that book for you and it will i hope<br>find a very special place in your home<br>alongside the middle for you and your<br>far now to remember the special occasion<br>so that's enough from me without further<br>ado I'd like to hand over to<br>fiona has cars headed apartment to<br>introduce you when you talk no later<br>Couture it's my pleasure to give a<br>little bit of background to Cal so Carl<br>him so it's gonna be a bit of a<br>biography sort of weaving in some of the<br>the his great scientific discoveries I<br>guess and leading up to introducing his<br>talk so Kyle is actually in a Tiger<br>graduate he graduated with two degrees<br>from Otago in 2002 BC and physiology and<br>also a better of physical education with<br>honors and he then moved to the<br>University of Calgary in the cold part<br>of Canada to complete his master's and<br>PhD and both of those were in the<br>neuroscience field Kyle worked with<br>professor Jade at Baines and he studied<br>a group of neurons that secrete two<br>really important hormones oxytocin and<br>vasopressin in professor Baines who was<br>one of the referees for this nomination<br>sees that Carl employed innovative<br>techniques including electrophysiology<br>to measure the electrical firing of<br>these brain cells as well as imaging to<br>study changes in signaling pathways in<br>these cells now the quality of this work<br>was recognized by the award of the<br>Governor General's gold medal and it's<br>the top award for a PhD thesis at the<br>University of Calgary which is a well<br>known and very prestigious institution<br>after his PhD<br>Kyle I guess looked around and he found<br>that in Physiology we had professor<br>Ellen Harrison working here and Carl<br>took up a postdoctoral posture<br>postdoctoral fellowship was the Ellen so<br>that was associated with our department<br>and also the Center for neural<br>endocrinology and it was in 2010 Cowell<br>moved his interests to the main neural<br>circuit that was studied in the her<br>Burson lab and that's the neural circuit<br>that controls fertility<br>and he studied a group of neurons that<br>secrete another hormone GnRH and working<br>with a team in allen's lab kyle<br>discovered this neuronal structure that<br>richard referred to and that is that<br>it's a it was obviously it was just a<br>non no one had had recognized it was<br>there before so it hadn't been described<br>and it come but it's the structure on a<br>neuron that combines the properties of<br>both an exon and a dendrite and they<br>named that the dendron so this work was<br>published in 2013 in the Journal of<br>Neuroscience and it's a prestigious<br>journal in that field and I understand<br>at the moment it's sitting on a very<br>impressive 89 citations in professor her<br>Burson says that this work has<br>fundamentally changed thinking on how<br>the neural circuit controlling fertility<br>operates and now virtually every wiring<br>diagram in this field now incorporates<br>the concept of this dendron and in 2014<br>Kyle was awarded the prime minister's<br>McDormand emerging scientist price for<br>based on this work also in 2014 we<br>appointed Kyle as a lecturer and to the<br>department of physiology and this is<br>when he started to develop his own<br>independent research program and he<br>moved to a third neural circuit and<br>that's the circuit that controls our<br>stress responses now since 2014 kyle has<br>been awarded a string of continuous<br>funding for this project including again<br>a prestigious Sir Charles hookahs health<br>research fellowship a Marsden fostered a<br>full Marsden project grant and most<br>recently a health risks Research Council<br>project grant all as principal<br>investigator now Carl is known for<br>developing techniques that push forward<br>our understanding of neuronal circuitry<br>in a particular more recently he's<br>pioneered the use of fiber photometry at<br>Otago and this is a new technique right<br>at the forefront of his field and it<br>allows specific populations of neurons<br>to be monitored and recorded in real<br>time in conscious behaving<br>it's kind of the ultimate of finding out<br>what's happening in real time in neurons<br>in the brain and his first major paper<br>using this technique to study neurons<br>involved in the stress response has just<br>been accepted into nature communications<br>so now I'd like to invite Carl to<br>present his lecture titled neural<br>signatures of stress and we look forward<br>to hearing a bit more about that work so<br>thank you first of all for that lovely<br>introduction that I've received and<br>thank you for this great honor being<br>awarded this the Rowe Heath trust award<br>in the Cal Smith middle so I think<br>success in science is determined not<br>just by you know the hard work of the<br>individual but there's a huge team<br>behind those people as well and I want<br>to thank a few of those people before I<br>start so I think yeah my research<br>Minter's over the years so my my PhD<br>supervisor JD my postdoc supervisor<br>Ellen her Burson and all the academic<br>members in my department which had<br>provided support since I started as a<br>lecturer I also want to thank all the<br>support staff in our department that do<br>all the kind of behind the scenes work<br>that also allow us allows me to do the<br>research and they do a fantastic job in<br>our department of physiology I also work<br>in the center for new endocrinology<br>which is a really hub for research and<br>neuroscience a totai go especially in<br>kind of the the type of research that I<br>do and it's a truly world leading center<br>for research and very honored to be a be<br>a part of that I also want to extend a<br>huge thanks to my lab who you know<br>other guys at the coalface doing the<br>research and doing the experiments on a<br>day-to-day basis now I'm going to be<br>talking about the research that they do<br>tonight I can cover only a part of it<br>because there's so many cool projects<br>going on but I want to thank them for<br>all the hard work that they do it's much<br>appreciated and finally I want to thank<br>my family many of who are here tonight<br>my parents my wife Joan and daughter<br>Sylvie and my son Enzo who couldn't be<br>here for all their support over the<br>years as well ok so now I want to move<br>on I guess to to the to the science side<br>of things and tell you about the the<br>research that my lab is interested in I<br>guess the research question my lab is<br>interested in and that is really trying<br>to understand the brain circuits that<br>control our stress responses more as I<br>guess<br>specifically I'm really interested in<br>the neural signatures and what I mean by<br>this is that the patterns of neural<br>activity in the brain the unique<br>patterns of activity which ultimately<br>drive behavior drive kind of<br>physiological output and I'll explain<br>this more as I go through so as you all<br>know we have remarkably complicated<br>brain with billions and billions of<br>neurons in it with trillions of<br>connections between all these different<br>neurons and we have dedicated circuits<br>in our brain which do different<br>different jobs in our body I'm really<br>interested in the brain circuits the<br>neural circuits down here in a deep part<br>of the brain called the hypothalamus in<br>as has been introduced tonight I've<br>studied several different parts of the<br>these circuits these survival circuits<br>that control water balance or fertility<br>but I'm going to tell you about stress<br>tonight so in this region of the<br>hypothalamus there there are different<br>parts and I'm really interested in this<br>one part here this there's quite a<br>beautiful structure called the<br>paraventricular nucleus of the<br>it's quite a mouthful the<br>periventricular means it's on either<br>side of this thing here this is a<br>ventricle and this is where cerebral<br>spinal fluid goes through and it kind of<br>looks like a heart shape or a butterfly<br>shape structure and these glowing things<br>here are brain cells which have been<br>labeled with a particular dye or marker<br>and you can see three different colors<br>three different types of brain cells<br>that do different jobs in the structure<br>there are these green oxytocin neurons<br>there are these blue vasopressin neurons<br>but today I'm going to talk specifically<br>about these orange neurons these orange<br>brain cells which are the CRH neurons<br>the corticotropin-releasing hormone<br>neurons so these are M cells make this<br>particular peptide called<br>corticotropin-releasing hormone but I'm<br>just going to call it C RH for short<br>because it's too much of a mouthful so<br>these neurons are I like to think of<br>these cells as the master controllers of<br>our stress response they are that the<br>primary neurons in our brain controlling<br>a neuroendocrine stress response so when<br>we encounter a danger in our environment<br>potential threat information is<br>transferred from other neural circuits<br>in the brain to these cells and tells<br>them to become activated once they're<br>activated they release signals into the<br>blood which activate the pituitary and<br>then subsequent signals which activate<br>our adrenal glands so our adrenal glands<br>are these structures on top of our<br>kidneys on either side of our body here<br>and our Drina glands release other<br>hormones they release stress hormones<br>into our body and in humans that the<br>primary steroids stress hormones<br>cortisol you may have heard of this<br>before people talking about stress in<br>cortisol so cortisol is our primary<br>steroids stress hormone and other<br>animals you may have heard of<br>corticosteroid in cortisol it travels<br>throughout the body and it mediates many<br>of the effects of stress it acts on lots<br>of different parts of the body to change<br>its function and help and it helps us<br>adapt and survive a<br>trésor or a threat so it acts and all<br>these systems here to change function x<br>on the bone and the reproductive tracts<br>that are acts and the immune cells a<br>Texan mobilizing fuel stores glucose X<br>and the gastrointestinal system the<br>cardiovascular system and importantly on<br>the brain and overall it's changing all<br>the function of these different organs<br>in our body to make us more likely to be<br>able to survive that impending danger<br>that impending potential injury that<br>could result from this threat that's in<br>our environment so a lot of people think<br>that stress is bad but actually acute<br>activation of this system this pathway<br>is a good thing you know we want to<br>these systems have evolved to help us<br>survive and so when we have encounter a<br>danger a threats acute release of stress<br>hormones into our body are beneficial<br>they drive adaptations that help us<br>survive the the threat or the danger<br>what I guess when the system breaks down<br>when stress becoming become a bad thing<br>when stress hormones can become a bad<br>things when it's chronic<br>so either chronic activation of these<br>stress circuits or chronic elevations in<br>cortisol levels in our body are really<br>detrimental to health and that's because<br>they change all these structures they<br>cause long-term changes which end up<br>leading to a kind of disease states or<br>predisposing us to disease states<br>likewise this can all start in the brain<br>as well so if we have some for some<br>reason the neural circuits in our brain<br>and not the patterns of activity are not<br>working right and we have dysfunctional<br>stress responses that start on the brain<br>this can also lead to diseases as well<br>most notably neurological diseases<br>depression anxiety post-traumatic stress<br>disorder are all associated with<br>abnormal functioning of stress circuits<br>in our brain so it becomes quite obvious<br>that this is an important thing to study<br>we<br>to understand how the system works and<br>healthy individuals we need to<br>understand how it works you know<br>response to a acute stress to understand<br>normal function before we can understand<br>and treat kind of the diseases that<br>result from abnormal functioning of this<br>circuit okay so now let's look at the<br>kind of profiles of stress hormone<br>release into our body so we can measure<br>stress hormones in our blood we can<br>measure this in animals we can measure<br>in humans I'm going to just I guess use<br>a human as an example here the first<br>thing to point out is actually that our<br>stress hormone levels are never zero so<br>as you guys are sitting in the audience<br>here you have a ongoing secretion of<br>stress hormones into your body it<br>fluctuates across time across the day<br>and this is actually really important<br>for your normal kind of function and you<br>know normal body function because these<br>the this cortisol is important for<br>regulating a lot of systems okay so now<br>let's imagine a hypothetical situation<br>where you might encounter a lion so say<br>you're on safari in Africa and you're<br>wandering around outside your your tent<br>and a lion jumps out at you okay so this<br>this stimulus could rip you limb from<br>limb right so it's a real threat it's a<br>real danger to you this is this is<br>something that you're going to want a<br>mount a stress response to so this<br>information is passed through various<br>neural circuits to your CRH neurons<br>which we would assume become activated<br>and drive the activation and the release<br>of cortisol into our body so there's a<br>massive release of cortisol this is<br>going to mobilize fuel stores and do<br>other things to help us escape and well<br>potentially fight off this line if we<br>have to but hopefully it doesn't come to<br>that<br>anyway the lion actually walks away and<br>as that stressor is removes as the<br>threat has removed our cortisol levels<br>drop back down to towards baseline<br>levels so you're talking to the game<br>keeper<br>that night you say you've encountered<br>this lion and he says I'll don't worry<br>it's a tame lion actually he's quite<br>friendly<br>you can pass him you can feed them it's<br>fine you okay so the next day you're out<br>again walking around and you come across<br>the same lion and this time you think<br>well yeah I trust that guy but I'm not<br>sure you still have quite a large stress<br>response but it's smaller than the day<br>before<br>the following day you guess we're going<br>to say you come across the same lion<br>this time other people in your party are<br>passing it someone's taking a selfie<br>with it it's seems actually quite a nice<br>lion and your stress responses it's much<br>smaller<br>you're adept over time and this is<br>actually a good thing you want to only<br>respond to stresses that are really<br>dangerous because you know you don't<br>want to release too much stress hormone<br>into your body all the time<br>you don't want to keep on activating<br>these stress circuits because ultimately<br>that's that's damaging if you do it too<br>much so your body has systems in place<br>to adapt to stresses that are<br>non-harmful and this adaptation is a<br>normal process it's an important process<br>and and we know from from stress hormone<br>measurements that it takes takes place<br>what we don't know about is really what<br>happens up here in the brain what are<br>the actual patterns of neural activity<br>that drive number one what happened what<br>are the patterns of activity that drive<br>this basal secretion what are the<br>patterns that drive this massive surge<br>of secretion and how does plasticity<br>happen in the brain to drive this<br>adaptation to these non-harmful threats<br>so I guess that's where where<br>neuroscience comes in that's where my<br>interest lies is understanding the<br>changes of neural activity in the brain<br>which underlie the the secretion of<br>stress hormones into our blood and<br>that's what I'm going to tell you about<br>today so I want to understand I guess<br>this regular regulation of this process<br>at multiple levels so I want to<br>understand it at the level of a single<br>brain cell because that's the single<br>brain<br>so I guess is the individual the single<br>unit of computation in the brain that's<br>that's kind of the unit that's doing the<br>processing and I want to understand how<br>stress signals are encoded at the level<br>of a single cell connections of brain<br>cells that are talking to one another<br>relaying information to one another all<br>the way up to whole animals where you<br>have an organism which is behaving in<br>its environment encountering danger in<br>its environment trying to understand how<br>neural activity changes behavior and<br>endocrine and stress hormone output and<br>then is the ultimate goal of the<br>research is to translate this into<br>understanding better understanding<br>stress responses in humans and diseases<br>and humans so today I guess I'll tell<br>you about the progress we've made really<br>understanding stress from the level of a<br>single neuron up two whole animals we<br>haven't quite made it to humans that's<br>more I guess a goal for the future so<br>for the non neuroscientists and the<br>audience I just wanted to take a step<br>back and tell you a little bit how a<br>brain cell works so this is a cartoon of<br>a brain cell that you might see in a<br>standard kind of textbook and there are<br>three different parts to it well there's<br>more than that but three I guess simple<br>parts to it we have the central region<br>which is the the soma this is kind of<br>where the genetic material is stored<br>where a lot of protein synthesis is done<br>off the soma you have these branches<br>which are the dendrite the dendrite is<br>actually the region that receives all<br>the input from other cells so all other<br>cells that are making connections onto<br>this this new you're on generally form<br>on this dendrite information is<br>transferred from one cell to another<br>here so information seems to flow from<br>inputs onto the dendrite through the<br>soma and then down this long wire which<br>is called the axon and this transfers<br>information from from this cell and<br>ultimately down to downstream neurons<br>that it connects with<br>so you may know that that the brain is a<br>electrical that we have electrical<br>signals in our brain electrical patterns<br>of activity and these individual brain<br>cells are also electrical entities as<br>well they process information and<br>communicate with one another via<br>electrical chemical signals so<br>electrical signals are originated up<br>here but can then be propagated down<br>importantly it's actually that the<br>pattern of electrical activity which is<br>incredibly important so here is an<br>example of very I guess a simple pattern<br>of electrical activity in a single brain<br>cell we have three three spikes of<br>electrical activity then arrest three<br>spikes of electro activity and arrest<br>three spikes so each of these clusters<br>of electrical activity are called a<br>burst of activity so here we have three<br>bursts of electrical activity and it<br>could be in this neuron that these<br>bursts of electric activity and code<br>information something's happens at these<br>three time points and that neuron is<br>responding to those things so very<br>simply this is this is the neural code<br>this is how neurons kind of work they<br>encode information with patterns of<br>electrical activity those patterns of<br>electrical activity and code either<br>things happening in the environment or<br>they drive responses of the neuron<br>depending whether it's a an sensory<br>neuron receiving input from the external<br>environment or maybe a motor neuron<br>which is directly controlling the output<br>of some circuit so now let's look at a<br>CR H nu remember these are the stress<br>neurons that are controlling stress<br>responses they're a little bit different<br>and that rather than talking to<br>downstream neurons they actually release<br>signals into the bloodstream so if we<br>look at the the the pattern of release<br>of these stress signals into the blood<br>stream you see that after every one of<br>these electrical spikes you have a<br>little blip of release such that you<br>after these bursts you get a burst of<br>secretion that that matches up with<br>every burst of electrical activity so<br>from this we can see a<br>you can see that by understanding the<br>patterns of electrical activity we can<br>start to see how neural activity is<br>shaping stress hormone release so the<br>important message here is that patterns<br>of electrical activity and the stressed<br>neurons directly determine the patterns<br>of secretion of stress hormones into our<br>blood so if we want to understand how<br>stress circuits work in the brain we<br>need to understand the patterns of<br>activity so the next question is how on<br>earth do we record these patterns of<br>activity we want to record them from the<br>level of a single brain cell we want to<br>record them in networks of brain cells<br>and we want to record these patterns of<br>activity in whole animals as well that<br>are running around and behaving and<br>interacting with your environment so how<br>do we use a single technique to do all<br>of those three things well I guess some<br>there's there's a few different ways<br>that we can do it but the way we've done<br>it is we're using light to record a<br>neural activity so I want to spend a<br>couple minutes explaining how we can do<br>this and weirdly it all starts with with<br>these green jellyfish so these these<br>green jellyfish glow green because they<br>make something called a green<br>fluorescent protein and some very smart<br>scientists they took this this the<br>genetic information encoding the screen<br>for some protein and they put it into<br>other cells and in other animals and<br>they they figured that they can make<br>other cells a glow green some other<br>smart scientists around the world they<br>changed the sequence for that genetic<br>code for that green fluorescent protein<br>and they made it glow different<br>brightness depending on the activity of<br>the cell so now we can basically take<br>the genetic code for the screen first<br>and protein and put it in a brain cell<br>and the amount of light that comes out<br>of the brain cell is going to change<br>depending on the activity of the brain<br>cell so it's like having a light bulb<br>inside the brain cell that changes light<br>intensity depending on your elective 'ti<br>so with increases of electrical activity<br>in a brain cell we have research in<br>green light<br>and with reductions in neural activity<br>we have reductions and green lights<br>so now by measuring just light we can<br>either measure activity from a single<br>brain cell lots of brain cells and<br>ultimately even in behaving animals<br>because we can measure light in all<br>these situations so we're going to use<br>genetic tricks to get this green<br>fluorescent protein into our CRH neuron<br>the modified version is called a G Kemp<br>and now by measuring light coming out of<br>our our stressed neuron we can<br>reconstruct the neural code so in this<br>cell here that was firing these these<br>bursts of electrical signals if we<br>measure the amount of green light coming<br>out of this brain cell we can see that<br>after each blip and the electrical<br>signal we see a blip in there and the<br>green light so now we can measure light<br>as a proxy for neural activity and<br>reconstruct the neural code in these<br>stressed neurons so we can do we can<br>click the light several different ways<br>we can use big chunky microscopes so<br>this is an example of the most<br>impressive chunky microscope in the lab<br>and it has lots of mirrors and lasers<br>and so you can you can take some nice<br>photos but importantly we can we can put<br>brain tissue underneath this microscope<br>and we can keep the brain cells alive in<br>this<br>we-we tissue bath underneath the<br>microscope by putting in solution that<br>has glucose and salt in oxygen and we<br>can then study those individual brain<br>cells all those small networks of brain<br>cells that are connected with one<br>another we can collect the light using<br>these things here with wires and them we<br>can actually record the electrical<br>signals at the same time as well okay so<br>this is what it looks like when we when<br>we take a movie underneath the<br>microscope so this here is a single<br>brain cell this is the soma of the brain<br>cell these things coming off here are<br>the dendrites I told you about before<br>and you can see that it's flashing on<br>and off so each of these flashes is a<br>burst of electrical activity so by<br>measuring light<br>now we can see in real time before our<br>eyes even just looking down the<br>microscope we can see that's happening<br>we can see the neural code of this<br>particular neuron in real time and the I<br>guess the neat thing is we can also see<br>this in many different neurons so if we<br>zoom out we can now start to see this<br>flashing and correlate this activity<br>between other cells we can see if the<br>activity is coordinated between cells as<br>it's synchronized what happens if we<br>block a type of communication does that<br>block the the synchronization so we can<br>do a lot of interesting things we could<br>okay so the first person in my lab who<br>really started doing this was a Julia<br>Gauss who was at first an honor student<br>then went on to do a master's and is now<br>in med school and she was interested in<br>studying the the patterns of activity in<br>these individual brain cells to see what<br>they looked like because we didn't<br>really have a very good idea<br>so the she measured the light coming out<br>of these CRH neurons that were glowing<br>green and what she found was and most of<br>the cells that she looked at these are<br>just four different examples but she<br>really studied hundreds of different CRH<br>neurons she found that actually the<br>levels of light coming out as an<br>indicator of neural activity was pretty<br>boring it was pretty flat nothing was<br>going on and so we wondered well this is<br>this may be a joke bit of an artifact of<br>of how we're doing the experiment we've<br>got a bit of brain tissue in a dish and<br>this doesn't really mimic the real life<br>situation and life you're going to have<br>a whole brain with an animal that's<br>getting sensory input from its<br>environment and we've really cut all<br>that off when we have some brain tissue<br>in a dish but can we mimic there by I<br>guess artificially stimulating the cell<br>with a signal that it might receive in<br>the whole brain in the signal we use to<br>try and stimulate and these these stress<br>neurons was a signal called Noor<br>gentleman so you may have heard of this<br>before it's a neurotransmitter which is<br>released into your brain when you<br>experience stress so there are other<br>populations of brain cells which are<br>activated by by threat and stress and<br>they send information to the CRH neurons<br>by releasing noradrenaline so we<br>wondered if this neurotransmitter in the<br>brain could change the activity of these<br>CRH cells and when Julia applied this<br>neurotransmitter to the CRH neurons she<br>saw a really remarkable shift in the<br>activity they went from being very quiet<br>to showing a really robust massive<br>increase in excitability not only that<br>they switched into this really unique<br>pattern of activity often characterized<br>by these recurrent bursts of electrical<br>wear and calcium waves so Julia did a<br>lot of work characterizing the receptors<br>and the intracellular pathways and I<br>don't really have time to go into it but<br>this was our first insight into the<br>patterns of neural activity in a single<br>CRH neuron the caveat being that it's in<br>a dish under a microscope so with that<br>caveat in mind we wanted to start<br>thinking thinking of other ways that we<br>could measure light coming out of the<br>brain now of animals as they interact in<br>their environment as they encounter<br>danger and encounter potential threats<br>so we can use powerful microscopes to<br>study single cells or small networks of<br>cells but we can't really plonk a you<br>know a microscope this big on top of a<br>small animal's head we need to have<br>something more subtle a more delicate<br>way to measure light coming out of a<br>behaving animal so we switch to a<br>technique that that fiona touched on in<br>the introduction called fiber photometry<br>so this technique allows us to use fiber<br>optics to measure light coming out of an<br>animal's brain so when we first started<br>doing this about four years ago well we<br>started thinking about doing it there<br>wasn't any companies that were selling<br>the equipment we needed so we had to<br>build our own but we didn't really have<br>the expertise to build our own so we<br>collaborated with some smart people at a<br>local Dineen company<br>Jesse Tito buckler and Butler and<br>Campbell Young who designed the<br>electronics designed the software to<br>allow us to measure very small changes<br>in light in an animal's brain Jun Kim<br>and my lab collaborated with Suhana and<br>Allen who Burson really to translate and<br>that the system they had built into the<br>lab and actually get real data out of it<br>so this is one of the first systems that<br>we've made basically it has some<br>light-emitting diodes in here that<br>generate light which pass light out<br>through a filter cube we have a system<br>of collecting light there goes to a<br>photo detector through an analog to<br>digital converter to a computer and what<br>this allows us to do essentially is to<br>to shine a little bit of light into the<br>brain of an animal and then clicked the<br>light that comes out importantly we're<br>collecting green light here and I told<br>you before that we can use this this<br>green fluorescent protein approach to<br>measure neural activity so increases in<br>neural activity correlate with increases<br>in green light and this system basically<br>does very minut measurements of the<br>light coming out and allows us to<br>reconstruct the patterns of neural<br>activity so I guess we were interested<br>in many many questions because this<br>technique really opened up a huge number<br>of things that we could now study the<br>first thing we wanted to study was just<br>the the patterns of activity in these<br>brain circuits under the resting resting<br>state so as I told you earlier as you're<br>sitting here your stress hormone levels<br>are fluctuating and they show this kind<br>of characteristic fluctuation over the<br>day even if there's no stress even if<br>you're completely calm and we wanted to<br>understand we wanted to know<br>do the CH neurons in your brain also<br>fluctuate their activity patterns across<br>the day even if there's no stress so<br>this was the PhD project of a Caroline<br>Fock and she measured the neural<br>activity from 8 a.m. in the morning to 8<br>p.m. at night and then 80 in the<br>following days for 24 hours of neural<br>activity recordings from this just the<br>CRH population and what she saw was was<br>pretty amazing actually she saw these<br>these amazing rhythms of activation in<br>this this neural network even though the<br>animal was in a completely calm resting<br>state we see these bursts of neural<br>activity happening roughly every hour so<br>the cool thing about this is that we<br>also know that in humans and many<br>species of animals your secretion of<br>stress hormone also happens roughly once<br>an hour as well so what we think is that<br>these bursts of activity drive the<br>ongoing rhythms and stress hormone<br>release over the normal normal course of<br>the day she also found that this<br>activity appeared to be higher at<br>nighttime so in rodents rodents are<br>active at night and so it seems like<br>there's higher activity in this circuit<br>at nighttime when the when the animals<br>active so that was a really cool first<br>insight into kind of the basal activity<br>patterns of this circuit without any<br>kind of stress around but when you think<br>of stress obviously you're thinking<br>about you know an acute stress response<br>so we were wondering how the circuit<br>changes when you encounter stress in<br>your environment so this was a project<br>of Jun Kim a postdoctoral fellow he<br>again recorded that the baseline levels<br>of neural excitability while there was<br>no stress no threat and he saw the same<br>kind of thing ongoing kind of low levels<br>of neural activity but then he played a<br>loud white noise to the animal and<br>immediately you see that the stress<br>circuit massively switches on there's a<br>very robust increase in<br>neural activity but as soon as the noise<br>switches off the activity returns back<br>to baseline levels so what he found was<br>that similar to Caroline there's an<br>ongoing low level of activity in the<br>resting state however as soon as the<br>animal detects a potential threat and<br>the environment remember this is just a<br>loud noise it's not a real it's not<br>going to harm the animal actually but<br>the animal thinks it's a potential<br>threat there's a switching on with this<br>system if the threat is removed the the<br>neural network switches off again so<br>this is really important you don't want<br>to have this system going on all the<br>time you don't want to active all the<br>time when the threat is removed it's a<br>so what we've achieved so far with us<br>this fiber photometry technique as we've<br>been able to start to understand the<br>patterns of of activity in the basal<br>state the resting state which drive the<br>resting secretion of stress hormones<br>we've started to understand how<br>encountering a threat in our environment<br>can drive a mess of secretion or stress<br>hormone and when that threats removed<br>the neural activity seems to switch off<br>just as quickly but you remember I told<br>you earlier that also there's this<br>adaptation over time such there as you<br>learn that something is non-harmful it's<br>advantageous to switch off these these<br>stress circuits and this white noise<br>this loud noise that June used as a<br>threat actually is the perfect stimulus<br>used because if you present this over<br>and over again animals and humans<br>quickly learn that actually it's non<br>harmful it's not threatening you no<br>longer a stressed by it so we would we<br>used this to test what happened to<br>activity or plasticity in this new<br>network over time yeah so what happens<br>to neural circuit activity in these CRH<br>neurons as an organism learns that a<br>potential threat is non-harmful so this<br>is that the the very large increase in<br>neural activity on the presentation of<br>the first time of this this loud white<br>noise the second time on day two so this<br>is only the second time has been<br>presented it's<br>the neural activity appears to be<br>slightly smaller on day three it seems<br>smaller again and day four it's even<br>smaller so if we just shade in the area<br>under this curve to represent the total<br>sum of neural activity and response to<br>this potential threat stimulus this loud<br>white noise we see that over multiple<br>multiple presentations the neural<br>response gets smaller and smaller so<br>what you see here is that the real-time<br>process of learning the animals learning<br>that this is non harmful and it's<br>shutting off the stress as well it's not<br>even activating its stress response<br>because there's no point in activating<br>it it's actually beneficial not to<br>activate it so this these increases in<br>neural activity are driving stress<br>hormone release from from our adrenal<br>gland and I told you earlier that these<br>stress hormones can also they travel<br>throughout our body but they can also<br>get back into our brain to change brain<br>function so there's a lot of previous<br>research looking at the effects of<br>stress hormones on how it shapes our<br>brain function and it's been shown<br>previously that that stress hormones<br>change our ability to form memories<br>change our mood our sleep patterns but<br>really interesting thing they can also<br>change our subsequent stress responses<br>make us more or less responsive to<br>stress so we're really interested in<br>this idea how our stress hormones<br>actually acting on these CRH neurons to<br>change their activity to potentially<br>modulate our responses to stress so now<br>we move back to our microscope we want<br>to study single CRH neurons now the<br>single brain cells again we have some<br>tissue in a dish under this microscope<br>this time these brain cells have been<br>labeled with a red dye so each of these<br>red circles as an individual CRH neuron<br>we can now with these wires we can<br>record electrical activity from just one<br>cell in the one cell was just shown here<br>we can fill it with dyes and actually<br>see that the full extent of its<br>morphology but the important thing we<br>wanted to do was to to record the<br>electrical activity and see how<br>electrical activity changed with or<br>without stress hormones around so this<br>was the vector electrical activity we<br>saw that<br>and these CRH neurons when there weren't<br>any stress hormones around when the when<br>these brain cells had not been exposed<br>to any elevations and stress hormone<br>level and this was the pattern of<br>activity we saw if there was stress<br>hormones around or if the brain cell had<br>been exposed to stress hormones and<br>you'll be able to see that the number of<br>electrical spikes is less here and we<br>did a number of experiments and this<br>showed that actually these stress<br>hormones were dampening down the<br>activity of these neurons so it seemed<br>like when the stress hormones were<br>feeding back on the brain they would<br>seem to be shutting down this neural<br>circuit and reducing the activity so in<br>summary what I've showed you today is<br>that we have a dedicated population of<br>neurons in our brain and neural circuit<br>which involves the CRH neurons these<br>corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons<br>and these neurons are really the master<br>controllers of our neuro endocrine<br>stress access so we our lab in<br>particular has been able to discover the<br>first time the patterns of neural<br>activity that happen over the day and<br>the non stress State just all the time<br>which are likely driving our ongoing<br>rhythms of stress hormone secretion<br>we've also been able to show how stress<br>actually leads to a change in activity<br>pattern are these CRH neurons when an<br>animal encounters a threat there's an<br>immediate strong activation of these<br>brain cells and this was going to<br>release a lot of CRH into the blood and<br>cause the the large amount of secretion<br>of cortisol cortical stearin from the<br>adrenal glands we also shown that there<br>are important kind of I guess safety<br>mechanisms whereby the<br>neural circuit can learn over time it<br>can adapt over time and it shuts off its<br>activity gets less and less as an animal<br>learns that a threat is non harmful and<br>this is a good thing we want to have<br>systems in place to prevent excessive<br>stress hormone hormone release and<br>prevent excessive activation of these<br>stress circuits and then finally and<br>what we've shown is that once released<br>into the blood these stress hormones can<br>actually feedback travel back into the<br>brain and act on these same cells here<br>the CRH neurons to dampen down the<br>individual excitability of these brain<br>cells again another safety mechanism to<br>feedback and try and prevent excessive<br>activation of stress pathways try and<br>prevent excessive release of stress<br>hormones into our blood so we think<br>we're starting to make some progress<br>into understanding I guess the how these<br>circuits work in a healthy brain but the<br>real challenge I think still lies ahead<br>and understanding really what goes wrong<br>in disease states you know what happens<br>to these neural circuits to drive<br>malfunction to drive abnormal activity<br>patterns which are associated with<br>particular we're interested in mental<br>health disorders where you have abnormal<br>stress to a good function so that's a<br>big challenge for the future so I just<br>want to wrap up by again acknowledging<br>all the people that made scientific<br>contributions here all the members of<br>the lab the Institute's that are part of<br>the collaborators all the many funding<br>bodies and finally thank you for for<br>coming along and listening to this thing<br>wonderful don't sit down Cal we've got a<br>few more words to say and then a few<br>things to give you it's my job to UM<br>give a vote of thanks and to summarize<br>as a physicist the main thing I'd like<br>to summarize in PO's on you all is that<br>no good research has done without some<br>optics so everything the circles back to<br>physics and light so thank you for<br>making that point so eloquently Carl but<br>it's also wonderful to see that in your<br>research you've already as an early<br>career researcher developed the ability<br>to get a group alongside you encouraged<br>and lead and motivate people to address<br>really big questions and it's also<br>really great to see that whilst you have<br>made outstanding progress so far that<br>there are many questions for you still<br>to be stimulated with in your journeys<br>to come I've also found that I've had<br>one of my one of my key mantras<br>reinforced about about stress and fear<br>and that fear is your friend or a little<br>bit of it can be as well in it and that<br>stress hormones are not too bad also<br>that we use strange language as as<br>scientists at times and I liked very<br>much that you use many many acronyms<br>along the way G if P's and C are H's and<br>other things that it's good but probably<br>the first time that I've heard a lion<br>being treated as a stimulus so careful<br>children there's a stimulus over there<br>avoid the stimulus so I thought that was<br>quite amusing and clearly great that you<br>have not only encouraged engaged with<br>academic people but you've identified<br>the linens in Eden we've got wonderful<br>innovators and innovative companies that<br>you can join with to help and develop<br>the tools and techniques for you so this<br>part of the evening is the test so if<br>you all think that Carla's done<br>sufficiently well to be awarded a little<br>book and a Midlands and other things<br>please join me in thinking<br>again for wonderful tools so I'll give<br>you a couple of things and ask you to<br>take a quick look at them probably not<br>open one and then put them down I'll<br>give you a special something that is<br>your I think your your lecture poster<br>that you can keep as a memento and of<br>course this wonderful laminated version<br>of from into Zed a humorous survey of<br>New Zealand by CV Smith and now I will<br>ask the vice-chancellor have come and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
