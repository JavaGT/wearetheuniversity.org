I<br>invite you to take your seats and having<br>and just having just enjoyed your your<br>morning tea once again a huge thanks to<br>all of our sponsors each of them we see<br>displayed on the screen here so 10 are<br>called o e more called Oro hockey<br>technique Oh papa he took<br>whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo room at the Copa<br>pani we thank them for their generosity<br>and their benevolence so round of<br>applause for our sponsors ladies<br>we're it not for our sponsors I might<br>have had to put a honey down in the<br>backyard yesterday those they all have<br>something to eat<br>welcome back for for our second session<br>ladies and gentlemen Alto mutter a taxi<br>are sick and our second tow mater now<br>Mikey our moodier to eat the aural<br>Tucker a panel discussion accelerating<br>action beyond the status quo and we're<br>fortunate this morning to have Julian<br>Greer who will chair our panel of a<br>wonderful EXPERTS<br>Julian has held leadership roles and<br>rare disorders New Zealand the National<br>Council of woman volunteer service<br>abroad International Planned Parenthood<br>Federation and New Zealand Family<br>Planning he work focuses on gender<br>equality and human rights and has<br>included service delivery advocacy with<br>the United Nations government and<br>communities and across the sectoral<br>coalition's Jill was previously<br>assistant vice-chancellor human<br>resources and equity at Victoria<br>University she is also a teacher a<br>writer a mentor facilitator and speaker<br>and co-wrote the people's report on the<br>SDGs<br>Chiara tato<br>could you agree attend a this is not on<br>your program but it is luckily on ours<br>so I'm not really submitting things we<br>have been given mobile and I seven<br>minutes to talk to you briefly about<br>here's the commercial the people's<br>report which is up online on its final<br>draft but by the end of this week we'll<br>be final full stop<br>no draft we hope and just to tell you a<br>little bit about that and why we did it<br>and if you prefer The Reader's Digest<br>version you will see that there is a<br>pamphlet around we're going to show<br>until here you can tell I'm a teacher<br>thank you the people's report has been<br>reduced to this size in the hope that we<br>hope it will go to libraries to schools<br>that those people we've been talking<br>about who wouldn't have a clue if you<br>say what are the SDGs in fact i said to<br>someone and a government agency the<br>other day well we're working on the SDG<br>she said what are they and then I said<br>to a parliamentarian yesterday would you<br>like to form a cross-party group and she<br>said you know I don't think we're doing<br>the SDGs I said no I'm not sure you are<br>over<br>it gives me great pleasure to be back at<br>Auckland University when I left I think<br>I was the youngest graduate at the time<br>a long long time ago and I left with a<br>degree that I'm always joked that I<br>would never have employed me so I'm<br>really lucky to be here now as one of<br>its oldest alumni I think thank you very<br>much indeed<br>so the peoples report I'm going to start<br>by saying what it's not it's not an<br>academic report it's a snapshot from<br>over 25 people about what they or their<br>organization are doing and how they see<br>our delivery of the SDGs we were going<br>to be more academic with footnotes and<br>everything else you'll see they're<br>noticeably absent there'll be a few more<br>probably at the end of the week but the<br>point was this is what people gave us it<br>represents the rich diversity of civil<br>society at the same time we did a survey<br>of about a hundred and eighty-six people<br>to ask has the government talked with<br>you about the SDGs are you working with<br>government to implement the SDGs do you<br>have a climate or sustainability policy<br>and what recommendations would you make<br>so that's what you have here and the<br>full report will be online and it will<br>also go when its final two government<br>agencies as well together with a policy<br>pack of recommendations we were asked by<br>her ei who set up a small steering group<br>to do this work it took us a little<br>while to find more core to join me and<br>we tried to do it very much on a treaty<br>and partnership model we presented<br>United Nations last month and a question<br>at the UN through the major groups asked<br>by Rania Ivers who is here from VA was<br>will the government commit to working<br>with Marti civil society and business to<br>deliver the sustainable development<br>goals our ambassador he's a great guy<br>and an old friend didn't have time to<br>answer a question amongst the others and<br>we're still going to be working towards<br>getting that an answer like all of you<br>and part of the reason for doing it is<br>because we hope that you will be part of<br>whatever goes forward from here today<br>and that we can be - it gives some<br>benchmarks it gives some very personal<br>pictures I have to say that probably I<br>find it profoundly<br>disenchanting to be involved in reading<br>every one of those entries and writing a<br>few of them I think it is a damning<br>indictment of where our country is and<br>so our questions will be concentrating<br>on what are the gaps between the vnr and<br>what should be how can we close them and<br>what can we do collectively I'm just<br>going to ask more core to come up and as<br>she comes you'll wonder why are there so<br>many recommendations well to be honest<br>the steering committee said to us why<br>aren't the three I said from my point of<br>view when the Millennium Development<br>Goals were formed George Bush spoke to<br>coffee urn on the top floor of the UN<br>family planning was taken out the day<br>before the goals were announced it took<br>us seven years to get them back and in<br>that time many people died many women<br>died who need not have died and for<br>those of us today I'm civil society we<br>spend a huge amount of time I've just<br>worked with rare disorders 400,000 New<br>Zealanders I couldn't get to meet a<br>minister I couldn't get to meet the<br>director-general they fall between the<br>gaps I'm going to see but they don't<br>have a disability think about some of<br>those people with rare disorders and I<br>also went to mention Maria and if you're<br>interested in the data<br>maria is from the school of government<br>done wellington and has mixed briefly<br>mentioned the database as well so over<br>that kind of we wrote in our code oh now<br>can all hear more unity no koto he would<br>attack unity tie-dye 1502 anger my<br>hockey comic Morris a hurry up when I<br>make you over here<br>um so one of the challenges of doing the<br>report was everyone gave us these<br>beautiful Tonga and his words and his<br>desires and so trying to put that into<br>words and move forward was quite<br>difficult as Marty we operate locally<br>really well it's not our default setting<br>and so through exercising our donor to -<br>hang out on our thinner way together we<br>can come collectively together to<br>exercise quite a huge hunger<br>you know for a bigger bigger cause we it<br>was we've what what actually ask myself<br>is what would it look like without the<br>report so we had to start somewhere and<br>we had to bring all these together and<br>the mixed bag that it looks like but our<br>deepest desire was to represent the<br>civil society and the aims in the goals<br>so I guess the most of one question for<br>us is where to from here so it's really<br>important that we move forward in a<br>coordinated way and a collective manner<br>and in a way that represents the goals<br>for what they are and our<br>responsibilities and as we move over for<br>the others to to talk about their<br>particular views and they are accept<br>standing examples I just want to say one<br>thing the people that we were able to<br>meet at the UN when the government<br>presented its report what really struck<br>us was the localization of the SDGs the<br>work that people are doing at the local<br>level was far more profoundly about<br>human rights then in fact if I have said<br>to them what do you think about the<br>Covenant on for example the elimination<br>of all forms of discrimination against<br>women at which point their eyes would<br>glaze over so I think localization and<br>we thought that my one request to all of<br>you to request one is make sure that<br>every person standing for local bodies<br>is asked about the SDGs the second is if<br>anyone can tell me who the academic was<br>who said it's time to stop borrowing<br>money we don't have to buy things we<br>don't need to impress people we don't<br>care about<br>I'll be hugely grateful a Chilean in<br>more technical douaa and before i hand<br>it over to Gillian to guide us through<br>the panel discussions we have a brief<br>video player Otto can I just introduce<br>first of all Kevin Hague who needs no<br>in among knowing are they all think you<br>oughta more to Tenneco toad in our coat<br>and after how to cut or can I begin<br>actually by expressing gratitude and to<br>Jill and McCall for the people's report<br>and who yet because that report is<br>considerably better than the voluntary<br>National Review a cut to the chase<br>because we've been asked to talk about<br>the gaps in the Vienna and what I heard<br>from the prime minister in her address<br>this morning was and now familiar<br>rhetoric of change but what we see in<br>the vnr is actually pretty much a<br>familiar same old same old and that's a<br>narrative about a plucky bicultural<br>country that's doing lots of things in<br>this area and I I can pretty much<br>recognize the paragraphs that have been<br>contributed by each of the various<br>ministries who put their report together<br>but what a what a what it misses is what<br>I think we actually heard from Jeffrey<br>Sachs this morning in to some extent<br>from rival Helen Clark is what I think<br>as though the basic and most important<br>fact which is that despite all of those<br>goals in the areas that I'm familiar<br>with at least actually the situation is<br>getting worse and it's getting worse<br>across the board and pretty quickly it<br>seems to me that that's the issue that<br>perhaps we ought to have focused on so<br>forest and bird works across land sea<br>fresh water and and climate<br>we're working to protect and restore<br>nature well we are one of few countries<br>and in the world with the highest rate<br>of endemic species so we are one of the<br>world's treasure troves we are the<br>country in the world with the highest<br>proportion of our native species at risk<br>of or threatened with extinction and<br>that's now in excess of 4,000 species<br>two-thirds of our ecosystems in decline<br>some of those some of our ecosystems<br>sadly pretty much lost that is a<br>disaster by any to by any terms and we<br>have some fantastic work being done by<br>dock and by community groups around the<br>country to actually bring back some of<br>our species we have over a hundred<br>species that have active efforts to<br>restore their populations in the sea of<br>4000 it's hopeless we need to change the<br>system Minister Parker is fond of<br>quoting Herman Daly who says you know<br>that the economy is a subset of the<br>environment and not the other way around<br>he's absolutely right and that same idea<br>is inherent in the work of young New<br>York Strom rock-strewn from the<br>Stockholm resilience Institute Kate<br>Roth's book donate economics which is<br>compulsory reading if you haven't got to<br>it already but fundamentally it's about<br>the relationship between the economy the<br>environment and people so we've got<br>things set up right now so that the<br>environment and people are effectively<br>inputs into the economy and it should be<br>the other way around we should be<br>setting our environmental goals and our<br>social goals and retooling our economy<br>so that it delivers on though<br>goals and that's the place that I think<br>the SDGs could play in our country and<br>it's absolutely the role that they are<br>not playing at the moment got all the<br>ministers in the room please put your<br>hands up<br>not a frill John yeah and I think that<br>goes goes to my my fundamental point<br>what we have to do together is to change<br>this dynamic that sees these<br>international agreements as almost just<br>a treadmill of of of compliance<br>bureaucracies bureaucratese that does<br>not actually engage with or drive any of<br>what we do to basically so there's what<br>we need to change just our economic<br>system and our governments engagement<br>thank you so much and I'm introducing as<br>he comes up and who is the director of<br>surgery at the Auckland DHB and just<br>leading what I consider to be an extra<br>accompanied by the manager of<br>sustainability and you know who's he is<br>somewhere I think a remarkable story in<br>terms of how the SDGs can be implemented<br>and reported on and make a difference in<br>all sorts of settings including the spec<br>Telford's thank you so much yours if you<br>look at the people's report you will see<br>an interview with and which will tell<br>you much more than he's able to tell you<br>today thank you<br>thank you Kotoko Manawa Okutama Ricci is<br>he RAAA Rory - cuca who are ahah ah<br>Fiona a hawk or no na ho ho ho token aha<br>YY Kimura<br>Kotoko are we are aha Keaton gotta go<br>errand Mary talking or tena koutou katoa<br>so health in the STG era is complex and<br>it really demonstrates the interplay of<br>all the different STDs into the health<br>space and the NVR describes as we just<br>heard Kevin said really nicely that<br>overall gloss of what's happening in the<br>health space but really just<br>underpinning and underlying that there<br>are the challenges and if we look at<br>climate and health the interplay gets<br>really complex and there's no nose no<br>mistake that in the zero carbon bill<br>meant as submissions there were 11<br>district health boards plus multiple<br>medical interest submitting to this<br>because of the massive impact on health<br>on our environment we've taken this on<br>board at the DHB and this is very much<br>to a local level and Manjula is here in<br>the audience today who's been driving a<br>lot of this but since 2015 we've managed<br>to reduce our carbon emissions by 28%<br>but I'd argue that actually that's the<br>easy stuff<br>I'm going to give you a fly through of<br>the impacts of Health and the gaps in<br>the end the vnr starting perhaps with<br>poverty with 19 percent of our children<br>in this country living in food poverty<br>with the number of food grants<br>skyrocketing so this is we see this<br>through the local mission here we see<br>this around the country that the need is<br>high and for those of you who don't<br>understand understand equity this is a<br>real stark example this is looking at<br>deprivation indices and their life<br>expectancy for women in New Zealand and<br>the standout here is that if you are<br> ha and the worst the most deprived<br>area in New Zealand you have a better<br>life expectancy that a Maori woman and<br>them the least deprived area there's a<br>common theme coming through this in<br>surgery which is the pointy end that I<br>work in<br>there's certainly problems if you have<br>in areas of deprivation but we see that<br>Maori are at sixteen percent higher risk<br>of dying from surgery<br>we know that the statistics that came<br>out the other day that there are rung<br>that are young Maori men are on guitar<br>he are the ones who are at risk of<br>suicide and if you have this one thing I<br>could add you to read it is this a<br>window on the quality of air T ro and<br>New Zealand's health care this catalogs<br>in equity after inequity and that exists<br>within our health system so moving from<br>health what are we doing in the gender<br>space well we know that our data again<br>is stark we have a hundred and ninety<br>four family deaths with a gender<br>preponderance of men and unfortunately<br>in this space we are seeing Maori<br>over-represented in the deceased and the<br>offenders and we look at the impacts on<br>homelessness coming under SDG 11 the<br>need for homelessness and this city<br>alone we have had 20<br>thousand Aucklanders meeting the<br>definition of homeless with a 35%<br>increase between the last five and the<br>last five or so years so we are not<br>doing well in the areas and societal<br>areas in the SDGs what can we do so at a<br>local level we've undertaken a<br>materiality matrix at our DHB this is<br>very much hot off the press but you can<br>see that health whilst it's the most<br>important it's the areas of poverty<br>equality education clean water that are<br>really making the difference<br>we need to transition from a high carbon<br>health system to a low-carbon health<br>system that's one with a patient and<br>farno centered care with lena pathways<br>leading to a reduction in carbon but<br>we've talked about the Swedish models<br>been described but the piece that's<br>missing here and has been eloquently<br>described is putting the treaty at the<br>center of this when we're designing it<br>the model of Maori health equity which<br>is a balance of equity and Maori health<br>with the treaty is something that we can<br>take Raguse all the SDGs taking just the<br>word health out and we would see the<br>impact that we can have this has already<br>been referred to this is the the the<br>model of that model that we should be<br>adapting packs of a different economic<br>piece but if we don't have our social<br>foundation right we're not going to be<br>able to address the planetary sealing so<br>I refer back to this that we really know<br>only need to paddle in unison but we<br>need to accelerate that paddling and if<br>I could take from the recent whole<br>documentation the Waitangi tribunal<br>first report into health the words of<br>lady to Aditi Moxon what more can be<br>said now it's time to put recommendation<br>yada and it won't surprise you to know<br>that when I interviewed him he said it's<br>about kaitiakitanga it's about manake<br>tango if we get it right for those who<br>will benefit most we will get it right<br>for everyone and now it gives me great<br>pleasure to again introduce someone who<br>needs no introduction<br>Sophie you will notice in the report<br>there's an SD g18 what I always call the<br>missing goal which is young people I<br>told my mother many years ago I'm not<br>having children look at the mess you've<br>it was Vietnam of course so Sophie<br>you're not here just because you're a<br>representative young people you're here<br>because you're a leader thank you so<br>very much from all of us for what you've<br>done<br>it's in a Kolkata call why no he took a<br>manga call why no he took our course in<br>Peters Hall took a midday and nor packet<br>header kyoho call Hanford over called<br>Pickford or cou far no course Sophie<br>Hanford silcoon where we are all leaders<br>of today a simple definition is that<br>leadership is the art of motivating a<br>group of people to act towards achieving<br>a common goal working with the group to<br>come up with a vision with the climate<br>crisis at crisis being the biggest<br>threat to manatee is ever faced we are<br>going to need some bold visionary<br>leadership to bring everyone along as we<br>set out to save the world<br>the common goal must be to safeguard<br>this planet this is our only home as a<br>young person I'm often lead to believe<br>that I am a leader of tomorrow and we<br>found when organizing the first school<br>strike for climate in New Zealand we<br>will meet with the reply of stay in<br>school or why don't you do this on a<br>weekend but when our leaders aren't<br>showing any urgent action in addressing<br>this crisis it becomes us to ask young<br>people to show this leadership we must<br>step up and be leaders of today<br>otherwise our planet might not survive<br>we might not make it through sitting by<br>and watching the water swallow our<br>Pacific Islands hearing of hundreds of<br>species going extinct seeing some of our<br>youngest American not even know the<br>state of what the future might be that<br>really doesn't sit well with me and that<br>doesn't sit well with the 10 year olds<br>that are helping us organize these<br>school strikes nationally it doesn't sit<br>well with the 70 people we have in our<br>national organizing team for school<br>track for climate in New Zealand and the<br>20,000 young people who went on strike<br>for climate justice with us on March<br>15th and May the 24th we only have 11<br>years to seriously reduce our emissions<br>we cannot stand by and watch this unfold<br>in this time we need to see serious and<br>bold changes made by our leaders in<br>those worldwide but also action from<br>ourselves in this room we need system<br>change but we cannot have this without<br>the power from the grassroots everything<br>is on the line to succeed we must first<br>believe that we can and it will take all<br>of us these institutions and just for<br>our politicians as<br>earlier we could be the generation and<br>the group of people that save the world<br>now I see a huge gap in the area of<br>vision ambition and justice we could be<br>creating the best possible New Zealand<br>that we all want to see through taking<br>action on climate change to some of<br>these massive issues that are in our<br>path we can be reducing inequality<br>improving well-being and reducing<br>indigenous injustice while bringing<br>about climate justice the SD G's are<br>inextricably linked<br>we at school straight for climate are<br>demanding climate justice because the<br>solutions to climate change should<br>decrease inequality is not perpetuate<br>them even further we must ensure that<br>the transition is intergenerational<br>adjust because what we don't do now<br>future generations will inherit the<br>repercussions of I don't see the kind of<br>ambition we need with the IPCC report<br>saying we have to have our emissions by<br>2030 in order to stay below 1.5 degrees<br>of global warming and be carbon neutral<br>by 2050 but it seems like New Zealand's<br>just using these targets which are a<br>bare minimum when we a developed nation<br>with a small population have the<br>potential to be a leader we have the<br>potential to show the rest of the world<br>what is possible and we need to be in a<br>place where our young people aren't<br>having to have sleepless nights because<br>of the impacts that climate change will<br>have on their future we have an<br>obligation under totality or Waitangi<br>into our Pacific neighbours to take this<br>crisis seriously and act now now if my<br>home was burning down around me I<br>probably wouldn't just go into the<br>lounge close the door and hope it<br>wouldn't reach me I'd grab the fire<br>extinguisher and I'd put it out we need<br>a plan how are we going to bring you've<br>run along with us how are we going to<br>mitigate the crisis how are we going to<br>adapt to the crisis how are we going to<br>ensure that solutions are bringing<br>people together and decreasing for any<br>qualities that we see in our world<br>instead of further perpetuating them now<br>take on climate change is going to take<br>more than just going through the motions<br>and taking things off a checklist like<br>achieving lots of these STDs I think we<br>need to think of humanity like a whip an<br>ecosystem and use our diversity to come<br>up with more innovative solutions by<br>using the strengths of every<br>in this so-called web now not just the<br>web of big corporations of lawyers of<br>activists of writers but of everyone we<br>all have strengths we all have something<br>to give and we all have something to<br>contribute when it comes to securing our<br>collective future let's use our skills<br>to put pressure on our elected<br>representatives those who are supposed<br>to be safeguarding this planet for<br>future generations let's use the people<br>power that we have collectively because<br>united we can never be divided<br>Killick direction can mean working with<br>a few friends that can mean working with<br>your family your school your workplace<br>20,000 young people we need all forms<br>and it starts with that first<br>conversation now I said at the beginning<br>we are all leaders of today so let's<br>empower each other to discover our role<br>in the solution and our role to<br>achieving these is DG's Jane Goodall<br>said only if we understand can we care<br>only if we care where we help and only<br>if we help shall we all be saved<br>kyouda<br>and I'm so too close I'm going to borrow<br>an African oq just say if you<br>want to go fast go alone if you want to<br>go for take others with you please join<br>your hands for all of the panelists did<br>knocking what the Tanakh ecotone what<br>they play at a photo I put the P P<br>ha I'm watching what was the corridor<br>can I just say how marvelous and<br>heartwarming it is to hear particularly<br>in the lead up to Maori language week<br>everyone who is stood to speak so far<br>provides something of a Maori greeting<br>worth not a full Maori passport and CV<br>declaration by the apipa hosta thank you<br>very much for that it really is very<br>much appreciated<br>before I have a number of questions to<br>ask time is short so perhaps walk will<br>go with one of the first ones here as<br>youth we're confused on one hand we're<br>told that we need to change systems on<br>the other hand<br>we're often disempowered what can you do<br>to change systems go for it<br>I can popularly relate to feeling<br>incredibly disempowered and incredibly<br>overwhelmed and that is what brought the<br>school strike for climate movement to<br>altaira was be feeling extremely scared<br>extremely overwhelmed and extremely<br>disempowered but I got together with a<br>few friends and we said you know we're<br>actually all feeling pretty disempowered<br>and I think as you see it as youth we're<br>confused and we are confused so I think<br>we need to come together as a generation<br>of young people and talk about why we're<br>feeling disempowered and then work<br>together on doing something about that<br>and also trying to empower others<br>because I doubt it isn't just you that<br>if disempowered and slightly overwhelmed<br>by this crisis so I think yeah just<br>connecting with other people and trying<br>to empower each other<br>whether it just be starting from your<br>group of friends and then expanding that<br>outwards<br>I can I can relate to that so much I<br>just wanted to I'm gonna completely<br>agree with that and I think that on<br>climate change that Sophie's absolutely<br>right that lots of people are confused<br>and they're confused in part because of<br>a completely mixed message that our<br>governments have sent on the one hand<br>they've been saying climate changes are<br>really important important important<br>threat and we need to be doing something<br>about it<br>on the other hand they're not doing<br>anything about it so it's inevitable<br>that the population will feel well is it<br>really important or not and I think what<br>they're what the school strive for<br>climate underlines is that the<br>leadership can come from anywhere and we<br>cannot afford to be waiting for for<br>government to actually lead we have to<br>lead ourselves and ultimately success<br>will come from a coalition of community<br>voices and governments working to you<br>know perhaps just this last one which is<br>popped up right up to the top how can<br>the private sector with big profit<br>margins contribute more to this cause<br>more for this cause could I pick up on<br>that one I just want to give you an<br>example of our few people here in the<br>room a volunteer service abroad they<br>have a partnership for example with<br>Donna for young cadets every year spent<br>three months two young men for example<br>insisted on private sanitation<br>facilities for girls in the Solomons<br>together they worked with local people<br>building capacity and learning so much<br>themselves to build 21 libraries we<br>build 21 libraries after a cycling<br>school sewing school libraries that to<br>me as an example of what the private<br>sector can do at its best and we cannot<br>stay with the old stereotypes you know<br>people will look at me and say oh well<br>you know she's an NGO she's a greeny<br>she's a lefty and I could look at snow<br>money and say well look they're a<br>rapacious greedy capitalist but in fact<br>probably neither was true there were<br>good NGOs that were very<br>there's good private sector and also we<br>need a new model of convergence STG 17<br>is absolutely right and it was rated<br>lowest by the NGOs on our survey that's<br>terrible we need to have government and<br>the private sector and NGOs and<br>community and of course academia a part<br>of civil society and a leader or we<br>wouldn't be here today<br>and just in response there's not maybe<br>big profits certainly not big profit and<br>health I have to say but in big sectors<br>and that the need to involve youth is<br>critical and soon Lee Ferrara made<br>material matrix we reached out to Gen Z<br>row and others and they and pointing you<br>in the direction of the Auckland 2050<br>map where they the rangatahi involvement<br>in that has been a really good example<br>of of partnership for youth in terms of<br>how else we can do it the what we don't<br>see much where New Zealanders social<br>business or social enterprise and big<br>profit business can support and<br>facilitate social businesses social<br>enterprise which is a really good<br>mechanism for I think achieving many of<br>our goals that that government aren't<br>managing once again thank you thank you<br>to all four if you think you for making<br>time this morning to be with us and I<br>can now finally described how exactly<br>your certificate will be presented and<br>what it will go towards so to show our<br>appreciation for
