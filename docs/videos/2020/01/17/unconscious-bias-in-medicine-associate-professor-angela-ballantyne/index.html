Every female doctor or medical students has probably experienced unconscious bias and may have lost count of the number of times that patients have referred to them as nurse or after finishing the consultation they have turned to the tall male medical student and asked the doctor what they think.  Angela tells us why we unconsciously make these kind of mistakes and how our exposure to M*A*S*H, ER or Grey's Anatomy influences our lifelong beliefs about healthcare professionals and shape our working lives.  Finally, she suggests way in which we can start to tackle the problem.  <br> <br>Associate Professor Ballantyne is a Bioethicist at the University of Otago in Wellington.  Her research interests include exploitation, research ethics, the ethics of pregnancy and reproductive technologies, and secondary use research with clinical data. She has worked in schools of Medicine, Primary Health Care and Philosophy in New Zealand, Australia, England and the United States; and as the Technical Officer for Genetics and Ethics at the World Health Organization in Geneva. In 2018 and 2008 she was a Visiting Scholar at the Yale University Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

all and thank you all for<br>taking the time to come here this<br>evening especially the males in the<br>audience who won't put off by the title<br>and we're brave enough to turn up even<br>though they might potentially be the<br>minority and a few housekeeping things<br>obviously if there's any emergencies<br>then the emergency exit is the door you<br>just came through or the door behind me<br>and there's some toilets just at the<br>back on the right hand side for those of<br>you who are coming to dinner this<br>evening we're heading over to vote 21 in<br>the Octagon straight after the lecture<br>and dinner will be served at 8:00 so be<br>on time and I think a special thanks<br>this evening goes to MAS who've been<br>supporting us for this event without<br>which we couldn't have held it this<br>evening and a special thanks really<br>because they've actually stepped up and<br>supported quite a few events over the<br>last few weeks and months a women in<br>surgery event and a women in research<br>event so it's great to have them here<br>supporting as this evening and you may<br>have noticed that at the University of<br>Otago here this evening is well and<br>they're kindly recording this event so<br>that we can use it as a learning<br>resource and use it to disseminate<br>understanding of unconscious bias a bit<br>more widely and for those people who<br>can't come this evening so and the real<br>reason that I organized this event this<br>evening was to try and encourage the<br>establishment of a network across the<br>region for women in the medical<br>profession to better support and sponsor<br>each other and I'm glad that quite a few<br>of our primary care and community<br>colleagues could come this evening as<br>well as Hospital colleagues and because<br>I really wanted this to be an<br>opportunity for us to build better and<br>professional relationships gonna be able<br>to put a face to the name of those<br>people we might briefly talk to on the<br>telephone but never really get the<br>opportunity to meet and I had the<br>pleasure of meeting Angela associate<br>professor Valentine at their vax annual<br>scientific conference in Bangkok and I<br>her talk on the topic of unconscious<br>bias really struck a chord I think with<br>a lot of their conference part<br>Spence and I think every female doctor<br>or medical students who's here in the<br>audience tonight has probably<br>experienced unconscious bias in their<br>careers and I can't count the number of<br>times that my patients have referred to<br>me as a nurse when I walked into the<br>room or after finishing a consultation<br>they turned around to the tall male<br>medical student next to me and asked<br>what the doctor thinks so Angela's going<br>to tell us a bit more about why we<br>unconsciously make these kind of<br>mistakes and how our exposure to<br>programs like ER and Grey's Anatomy of<br>influence to our lifelong beliefs about<br>how professionals and how it shapes our<br>daily working lives so associate<br>professor Valentine is a bioethicists at<br>the University of Otago in Wellington<br>and her research includes exploitation<br>research ethics the ethics of pregnancy<br>and reproductive technologies and<br>secondary use research with clinical<br>data and she's worked in schools of<br>medicine primary and health care and<br>philosophy in New Zealand Australia<br>England and the United States and as a<br>technical officer for genetics and<br>ethics at the World Health Organization<br>in Geneva and in 2018 and 2008 she was a<br>visiting scholar at the Yale University<br>interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics<br>so tonight she's going to talk to us<br>right great to speak to another group<br>people on this topic<br>um the Medical Journal of Australia<br>recently issued a request for a special<br>issue on the topic of is there gender<br>equity in medicine and a group of my<br>colleagues in Australia a group of<br>female colleagues wrote a submission<br>which consisted of one word which was no<br>and they received a revised of resubmit<br>from the Journal asking for them to<br>clarify their position and their<br>response was to write an open letter<br>which is now available arguing that it's<br>just really unhelpful for the journal to<br>be asking a question like that when the<br>lancet already this year has dedicated<br>an entire special issue to strategies<br>for addressing unconscious bias<br>their position was we shouldn't still be<br>talking about this so this this year<br>I've been doing a lot of talks on what<br>is unconscious bias and I feel like I'm<br>coming to the end of that so you guys<br>are kind of one of the last groups and<br>from then on instead of talking about<br>what is the problem and how do we<br>understand it hopefully we can all move<br>on talking about what are some<br>strategies and what evidence we're<br>starting to build about which strategies<br>actually work in terms of improving it<br>Cindy putting in race equally in<br>medicine so a couple of comments to<br>start with I don't meet some of<br>ordinance members at the Royal<br>Australasian College of Surgeons meeting<br>and Thailand and almost needed therapy<br>after that of having had like dinner<br>after dinner with people talking to me<br>about their experience in medicine I'm<br>an academic I worked in an office by<br>myself I only work with people I like I<br>just very naive about what workplaces<br>are actually like so I want to first of<br>all acknowledge that it's really easy<br>for me to talk about this in the<br>abstract but the people who have<br>actually broken ground in terms of<br>addressing in a race stereotypes with<br>gender stereotypes weight into diversity<br>stereotypes are you guys in the audience<br>so thank you for all the work you know<br>that<br>done actually in the workplace reiterate<br>the shout out to the white men in the<br>audience and particularly the white<br>middle-aged boomers because you guys<br>have been having a hard time recently<br>thank you for being part of this<br>conversation<br>it's really you know it's often not a<br>comfortable conversation and so I really<br>appreciate that people are kind of open<br>to talking about that I'm gonna make a<br>huge number of generalizations today I'm<br>talking and summarizing very quickly a<br>lot of the social science literature<br>when I talk about we do this I'm talking<br>about the population as a whole it may<br>or may not kind of match with your<br>personal experience you know that's fine<br>all of the references are available and<br>the note section and can be distributed<br>if people want to follow up in more<br>detail otherwise I'm gonna move over<br>stuff pretty quickly so I kind of fell<br>into teaching this topic to my medical<br>students in 2015 because two things were<br>going on one we had a gist mixture come<br>and speak to the class a health lawyer<br>and for that entire 90 minute session<br>the only students who participated in<br>the conversation were male students in<br>our class this I noticed and who<br>bothered me and then I was speaking<br>sitting next to my boss who's male I<br>said to him afterwards what was going on<br>with that and he said oh I've never<br>noticed I mean and I thought well he<br>hasn't noticed that it's possible that<br>the students themselves aren't even<br>aware that these dynamics are playing<br>out so that was happening but at the<br>same time I knew the medical students<br>were talking about the big sexual<br>harassment scandal that was going on and<br>surgery in Australia and that was the<br>case of perryland 10 who successfully<br>bought a sexual harassment claim against<br>senior colleague at Monash Medical<br>Center was awarded $100,000 in damages<br>so one of the kind of few people who<br>successfully navigated that process but<br>was subsequently excluded from the<br>medical profession so applied for eight<br>subsequent positions and public and<br>private hospitals in Australia didn't<br>get any of them in commenting on that<br>case Gabrielle McMullen another surgeon<br>in Australia see that her advice to<br>women and medicine now is that you're<br>better off giving a than making<br>us if you arrest MacLaine and you can<br>imagine a kind of response but there got<br>so<br>my medical students couldn't see that<br>case and see what was wrong with it<br>something really explicit like that but<br>they couldn't I possibly I was unsure as<br>to where they were noticing some of the<br>more subtle gender dynamics that were<br>going on in the class in response to<br>that ah okay okay um so in response to<br>the Carolyn tan case the Medical<br>Association Association in Australia<br>came out and said we don't just comment<br>about is you know clearly<br>inflammatory and inappropriate because<br>we have lots of amazing policies in<br>place that prevent that and that that<br>comment about policies irritated a whole<br>extra group of female doctors and this<br>is monisha that was published<br>anonymously as a senior surgeon now I<br>can definitively state that my gender<br>has not only influenced my career but in<br>fact has defined it it was defined when<br>I was denied operating sessions by my<br>unit head because my colleague had a<br>wife and child to support and it's<br>defined in the quick my dear here and<br>the comment about quotas and tokenism<br>fear it's relentless and it's real and<br>just because my unit here smiles as he<br>notes that my boots make me look like a<br>dominatrix does not render it any less<br>humiliating hear me when I tell you that<br>after 20 years of living every day<br>within this hamster wheel<br>I'm actually exhausted so I found this<br>really confronting I thought this can't<br>be the work environment that I am<br>preparing my medical students for um and<br>we need to kind of start having<br>conversation about this at least to<br>prepare them have the kind of skills to<br>navigate this kind of work environment<br>to jump to the end of the lecture ah so<br>there's kind of a no surprises policy<br>this niche is going to make no<br>difference in your unconscious bias<br>there's very little we can do to<br>actively rewrite our bias to clean up my<br>a done 40 I've had 40 years of<br>experience of interpreting the world so<br>all the solutions rely on mitigating the<br>adverse consequences of unconscious by<br>and basically the solution is to switch<br>from system 1 thinking<br>- for thinking this is a model developed<br>by Daniel Kahneman a Nobel prize-winning<br>economist the system 1 thinking is fast<br>unconscious that's automatic it's really<br>good for everyday decisions but it's<br>IRRI prone this is kind of trusting our<br>instinct system to is much more slow if<br>it fool requires conscious effort but<br>it's much more reliable so when we're<br>making decisions about hiring about<br>promotion you know about who how we're<br>going to set up policies for how we do<br>blind review of journals we need to be<br>not relying when I've got instinct but<br>slowing down our thinking and putting in<br>place mechanisms that try and mitigate<br>our bias so that's essentially where<br>we're hitting in the lecture today<br>there's some definitions to start with<br>so unconscious bias cognitive biases or<br>heuristics are basically shortcuts or<br>patterns of thoughts that help us<br>understand the world they're really<br>useful because they help us to<br>efficiently allocate our attentional<br>resources your brain is processing and<br>filtering much much more information<br>than you're aware of you simply could<br>not function as a human if your<br>subconscious mind was not filtering this<br>information and Alan directing your<br>conscious mind to focus on specific<br>elements right so it's really useful<br>overall they develop through repeated<br>exposure to indicator cultural biases<br>stereotypes but essentially bias<br>develops as our brains experience the<br>world and learn to develop it to<br>recognize patterns right so children<br>have a intuitive sense of gravity before<br>anyone's ever talk to them about physics<br>and if you've ever had a child but you<br>know constantly throws their teaspoon<br>off the side of the high tree that's<br>what they're figuring out right what<br>happens um and so they can learn<br>recognize these patterns and it helps<br>them extend future experiences I dropped<br>something and I was unloading with just<br>watch the other day and very<br>impressively caught it before it hit the<br>ground<br>um and it made me think you know I<br>didn't have to stop and think is this<br>gonna shoot to the roof is it going to<br>zoom out is it gonna twirl and circles<br>right I can anticipate where it's going<br>to go because I've got 40 years of<br>experience in the world but we do the<br>same thing in relation to cultural and<br>social patterns so in my daughter for<br>example<br>out of the world and sees that 90 plus<br>percent of world leaders a male 95<br>percent of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies<br>a male the principal at her school is<br>male but all of the teachers are female<br>she starts to associate the idea of<br>maleness and leadership and the more<br>often she sees male leaders represented<br>and media or stories or narratives the<br>more tightly of those ideas become<br>linked and a bucket in your head and<br>then over time the heart of those things<br>are to disentangle it's really important<br>to understand that men and women share<br>these biases about gender different<br>ethnicities buy into these stereotypes<br>about race okay so it's not something<br>that men do to a woman in relation to<br>gender bias women can internalize a lot<br>of these expectations and it actually<br>affects their behavior and often a<br>really subtle ways so one study they did<br>in the US was looking at math<br>performance and the gender stereotype<br>that women aren't as good at math so you<br>get the first cohort of students and you<br>ask them to do a masochist and that's<br>your baseline you get the second cohort<br>of students and you ask them to fill out<br>some demographic information before they<br>do it even checking a box indicating<br>your gender is enough to trigger the<br>stereotype that women aren't as good at<br>math the female students and that second<br>cohort underperform relative to the<br>first cohort right these are fit our you<br>know they're actually the way we operate<br>third group of students you don't ask<br>them about their gender but you ask them<br>about their ethnicity<br>if Asian students are reminded that<br>their Asian for female students before<br>they do the test they over perform<br>relative to the baseline okay<br>same thing works for men white men for<br>example taking white male college<br>students ask them to do an commit it<br>meets like running and jumping<br>that's your baseline next group you take<br>and you say we're doing this test<br>because they want to see how good you<br>are<br>compared to African American athletes<br>that Prime's the stereotype that white<br>athletes are not<br>don't perform as highly as<br>african-american athletes and so those<br>white male college students will<br>underperform relative to the baseline<br>this is called stereotype threat so bias<br>affects the way we perform the way we<br>see ourselves and the way other people<br>see and interpret our behavior bias is<br>problematic in one particular area okay<br>my intuitive understanding of gravity is<br>great because as far as we know gravity<br>is not going to change over the course<br>of my life so that's a good platform for<br>me to interpret future events on this is<br>of social policy particularly we were<br>advocating for progressive social change<br>our unconscious bias can become outdated<br>so for example when we have like a<br>conscious conversation and we see equity<br>goals for an organization or a field or<br>as a community we decide to legalize gay<br>marriage our unconscious bias acts like<br>a historical ball and chain how because<br>it's retrospective so that's where it's<br>problematic and specifically these areas<br>of progressive social change it impedes<br>their ability to move forward as quickly<br>as we would like here's a little example<br>for you so when I put up something like<br>african-american teen boys and hoodies<br>without you having to do anything your<br>brain will check in that bucket of<br>concepts and your head and start to pull<br>out ideas and images associated with<br>that phrase they won't look nothing like<br>this I mean so this is a photograph by<br>Miles Lofton he's was a 19 year old<br>photographer in New York when they took<br>this image a few years ago and it was<br>responding to a lot of the really<br>negative stereotypes about<br>african-american teen boys and hoodies<br>and particularly those who've been shot<br>by police when they were unarmed and if<br>you google you know teen black teens and<br>hoodies you get a lot of kind of very<br>dark and menacing mug shot images<br>compared to googling white teens and<br>hoodies and you get kind of get<br>commercial photos I mean so that little<br>kind of disconnect where you saw this<br>photo and you didn't have any existing<br>bucket to file in it that kind of like<br>oh yeah I would seen something like that<br>before<br>is an indication of the existing<br>architecture that's already functioning<br>in your mind<br>lots of stuff has been written on bias<br>recently<br>want to read about bias generally these<br>are some great books that I would<br>recommend if you want to delve a little<br>bit deeper so the first lesson when<br>we're thinking about bias in the<br>workplace is that you have to be really<br>skeptical of your own subjective<br>experience so one thing that happens is<br>that we experience the world and then we<br>tend to extrapolate from our experience<br>to other people in the workplace and<br>this is my experience of what being an<br>academics like and I assume that kind of<br>applies to other people but the way<br>people interact with us is always<br>mediated by our physical body okay and<br>we treat people differently depending on<br>their gender their race their weight<br>their height their attractiveness the<br>depth of their voice so I've only ever<br>experienced the world through the lens<br>of a white female who's quite slim and<br>tall that changes the way people see me<br>it changes the kind of privilege I have<br>survey of Auckland lawyers a couple of<br>years ago asked lawyers in Auckland is<br>there a trend for female lawyers to<br>leave the profession now female<br>respondents legal lawyers see a 90<br>percent agree with that yes that's true<br>only 30 percent of male lawyers agree<br>with that statement<br>it suggests that's true so 70% of<br>Malinois is thought what what tree I've<br>never seen such a trend I've never seen<br>women leave you know what I don't know<br>about this um you've essentially got<br>people sitting next to each other in a<br>workplace with an entirely different<br>view of the reality of what that<br>workplace is okay so the first thing is<br>don't extrapolate too much from your own<br>experience and assume because you<br>haven't seen bias it's not happening to<br>other people one analogy I like to use<br>as the hospital people you know you're<br>walking down a hospital corridor and if<br>all those doors open automatically for<br>you your brain is not going to allocate<br>your attentional resources to counting<br>how many doors there are okay that's<br>gonna be focused on other important<br>stuff if you've got to swipe to get<br>through each door you're more likely to<br>remember how many you've gone through<br>and if like me you're on an academic<br>path and you're always stuck in the<br>hospital and it doesn't bloody work and<br>you have to call people to let you get<br>through it to the doors you might get a<br>much better memory of how many you've<br>been through okay um<br>very really do we get to step outside<br>our own bodies and experience<br>see experience the world through the<br>lens of someone in a different body<br>transgender people are an exception to<br>this rule so this is been a Barbra bars<br>being bars was the chair of neurology at<br>Stanford studies at MIT transition quite<br>late in his career so in his early 40s<br>and has written a lot on gender in in<br>the sciences I'm really fascinating if<br>you've got a chance to follow up on his<br>work so he was obviously really aware of<br>a lot of the explicit gender bias that<br>occurred in the workplace so recalls<br>handing in an assignment when he was at<br>MIT and the professor saying well you<br>cannot possibly run this yourself your<br>boyfriend might've written this for you<br>right because there's no way you could<br>have got so much of this right but<br>what's fascinating about his experience<br>is that's really only when he<br>transitioned to being male that he was<br>became much more aware of some of the<br>subtler biases at play so two examples<br>one he talks about this not realizing<br>the extent to which he was constantly<br>interrupted as a female until he became<br>male and instead of felt like he was<br>surrounded by this bubble of silence<br>which was really disorientating where<br>people just waited till he finish<br>speaking until they started talking and<br>he talks about thinking example giving<br>one of his first lectures as a male and<br>overhearing people leaving and hearing<br>someone say wow that was really<br>fantastic his work is so much better<br>than his sisters now here's an every<br>sister right that's just the work that<br>he was doing presented through a female<br>lens and that's the way the world sees<br>the quality of the competency of that<br>work so the second lesson is the don't<br>so be wary of just relying on your own<br>subjective experience and don't go to<br>much I want your colleagues will tell<br>you to your face<br>so I have had the experience of speaking<br>to some senior surgeons you know over<br>the years who have said this is a little<br>bit confusing because there's a<br>disconnect you know it seems like<br>there's this big problem in surgery for<br>example or on gender but if I speak to<br>my you know female colleagues they<br>minimize that or they downplay it or<br>they don't recognize it so this kind of<br>seems inconsistent and my response is<br>often it's not inconsistent necessarily<br>right because if it's not a safe work<br>you can't necessarily expect people to<br>say to your face what their experiences<br>I for example don't go to philosophy<br>conferences and give talks on<br>unconscious gender bias and I give talks<br>on big data um because there's a<br>professional cost to being the person<br>that always raises this stuff I can come<br>here and speak to you guys about it<br>because they're quite the labyrinth you<br>have no power over me so none of you are<br>involved with you know any of my<br>promotion decisions I talk to people in<br>the public sector I talk to law firms<br>right because there's no cost for me<br>raising these issues in that environment<br>great book by Reni at O lodge why am i<br>longer talking to white people about<br>race here she is<br>but as a person of color even when you<br>find someone who's a white person who's<br>interested in structural racism and<br>wants to have that conversation with you<br>as the person of color you're still<br>required to prioritize the emotional<br>needs of the white person you're<br>speaking to you have to do all the<br>emotional and intellectual work to<br>package that message and your experience<br>in a way that doesn't offend the white<br>person or make them defensive okay and I<br>think women sometimes feel the same<br>thing and Relations talking about gender<br>issues in the workplace luckily for you<br>you don't have to rely just on what your<br>colleagues tell you face it to your face<br>because there was a huge amount of<br>evidence about unconscious bias I'm not<br>going to go through all of this the you<br>know as I said the references are<br>available so this is just stuff on bias<br>and then I'll talk a little bit about<br>medicine in the next slide so there's<br>evidence on whether we call back people<br>for interviews based on whether their<br>name is male or female whether their<br>name sounds like an african-american or<br>a white name hiring practices you'll be<br>familiar with I'm sure you actual<br>probably also familiar with the fact<br>that African Americans are<br>systematically under treated for pain in<br>America treatment for heart attacks was<br>looking at who gets referred on to<br>specialist services based on their<br>gender I'll talk about the do to pay gap<br>Abed in a minute we it's a<br>generalization I actually don't play<br>pretty games we shoot black pea players<br>more quickly in video games than white<br>players and interruptions of Justices is<br>a good one because it's really recent so<br>here they looked at 12 years of court<br>transcripts in the US with me at the US<br>Supreme Court and patents of<br>interruption we interrupt people who we<br>think are lower on the social hierarchy<br>than us and we tend not to interrupt<br>people who we think are more senior than<br>us over those 12 years women accounted<br>for 24% of the beach they were<br>recipients of 32 percent of<br>interruptions and they were only<br>responsible for 4% of interruptions so a<br>real difference they're the most<br>interrupted justice was we only female<br>justice of color during that period it<br>was constantly silent I think we're<br>talking over here and not only was<br>gender a really important factor in in<br>this kind of workplace dynamic<br>gender was thirty times more predictive<br>of interruptions than seniority it<br>served on the beach okay so it's a<br>really influential factor in terms of a<br>woman's experience of that workplace all<br>right medicine all right so we<br>everything is kind of quickly my point<br>is just to give you a sense of how well<br>you know this is just touching the<br>surface of all the literature on gender<br>and medicine so patients typically won't<br>interrupt the doctor because of that<br>power dynamic the exception is that the<br>doctor is female in which case both male<br>and female patients will interrupt him<br>more often than she interrupts them<br>female patients are more likely than men<br>to have their reports of pain be<br>perceived as a as emotional physicians<br>gender affects how displays of dominance<br>are perceived by patients so a female<br>doctors display dominance that's much<br>more destructive to the doctor-patient<br>relationship than a from male doctors<br>display dominance this is research from<br>Australia female students place more<br>importance on family and lifestyle<br>factors when opting for non-surgical<br>careers so gender plays a part in some<br>of the workplace decisions that women<br>are making research by Murray Bismarck<br>found that was barriers to women taking<br>on leadership roles and medicine and<br>these are to do with perceptions and<br>women's capability capacity and<br>credibility really recent studying<br>orthopedics from 61% of woman I still<br>asked illegal interview questions about<br>family planning for example completed<br>only 8% of men massive difference their<br>intern<br>their experience of the workplace<br>transplant surgery again really recent<br>2019 niches for male applicants were<br>significantly more likely to contain<br>agentic terms such as superb intelligent<br>exceptional and the term future leader<br>or as niches for female applicants were<br>more likely to use communities like<br>compassionate calm and delightful we all<br>want our surgeons to be delightful again<br>this just came out a month ago I think<br>female surgeons in Ontario and 24% less<br>per hour while operating okay so this is<br>why some colleagues of getting to the<br>part mean they're really frustrated as<br>to why we're still having this<br>conversation okay it's really well<br>documented um one thing that I wouldn't<br>you know if you take one thought away<br>from today's session I want you I want<br>it to be a huge degree of skepticism<br>about the idea of meritocracy so<br>basically what unconscious bias is is we<br>aren't judged on the quality of our work<br>right the quality of our surgical work<br>the quality of our academic writing if<br>you take a paper and you give it to<br>someone and it hasn't you there's no<br>indication of who wrote it then fair<br>enough there's such a thing as<br>meritocracy but we don't exist like that<br>we exist in human bodies right so the<br>way people judge the quality of our work<br>is partly on that work itself and partly<br>on the physical package that we're<br>presenting this is a lovely study that<br>really kind of emphasizes that this is a<br>study done at Yale University and where<br>they've got a group of students and seed<br>we need you to make a choice we have two<br>candidates for the next police chief one<br>is Michael he's streetwise and<br>risk-taker lives alone and has great<br>relationships with off with their fellow<br>officers and one of them shell she's<br>well educated politically connected<br>really great with the media and has a<br>wife a spouse and a child so so quite<br>two quite different profiles and their<br>students were given no criteria existing<br>criteria by which to judge them so the<br>first group of students who say who do<br>you think is going to make the next best<br>police chief well obviously Michael<br>unsurprising I'm a student can come up<br>with really you know quite sophisticated<br>justifications for that so they'll say<br>things like well we're thinking it's<br>much more important to have good<br>relationship with the officers and<br>underst<br>what frontline policing is like you know<br>those are kind of the really clinical<br>skills for success in this role so you<br>can a second group of students and you<br>do the same thing but you switch the<br>profiles so now Mike was well educated<br>and Michelle is streetwise and you say<br>who do you think would make the best<br>police chief well obviously Michael yes<br>good why is that and we're all good at<br>coming up with justification so those<br>days actually it's much more important<br>to be politically connected and be able<br>to kind of negotiate at those high<br>levels with other government departments<br>to get resources for the police then it<br>is to understand what frontline<br>reporting is like so what this shows as<br>if left to our fast thinking and<br>distinctive response our own devices we<br>don't actually look out and pick the<br>best candidate for the job we look at<br>through a filtered lens right and when<br>and what our brain does is identify the<br>person that most physically looks like<br>previous characters we've seen in that<br>role now the researchers are kind of<br>surprised at the degree of bias<br>demonstrated by the study so they redid<br>it with two extra editions one may ask<br>students to fill out a questionnaire<br>about all their conscious views about<br>gender and the role of women in the<br>workplace none of that was predictive of<br>how Beyer students would be okay because<br>it's often a really big disconnect<br>between what we think consciously and<br>what our unconscious bias is what was<br>predictive was student self perceived<br>objectivity so students who agree with<br>these statements my judgment in this<br>study was based on a logical analysis of<br>the facts and my decision-making in the<br>study was rational and objective with<br>the students who were most biased most<br>confident that Michael would be the best<br>person to a point so if there's people<br>out there we're thinking you know<br>unconscious bias interesting issue but<br>probably doesn't apply to me probably<br>does apply to you and probably more so<br>and the reason for that is if we think<br>we're rational and objective we have no<br>incentive to slow down our thinking and<br>switch to that system<br>okay if we've got a lot of humility<br>about that agreed you know how we're<br>making decisions we're much more likely<br>to switch over to system to thinking and<br>put in place mechanisms to adjust our<br>thinking all right so one of the ways<br>this plays out medicine is the wage gap<br>so men tend to choose high paying<br>professions like doctor engineer and CEO<br>while women naturally go towards north<br>paying careers like female doctor female<br>engineer and female CEO and this is data<br>from the u.s. because it's just always a<br>little bit easier to find this is 2019<br>data so male dominated fields and<br>medicine orthopedic surgery Neurological<br>Surgery and interventional radiology we<br>have got sort of 80 plus percent of men<br>in those fields female dominated fields<br>obstetrics and gynecology allergy and<br>immunology and pediatrics and if we look<br>these green fields are the highest-paid<br>subspecialties and the orange ones are<br>the lowest paid so you can see all three<br>of those male dominated fields are in<br>the highest paid sub specialties in<br>medicine and some of the female ones are<br>in the bottom these bottom ones<br>obstetrics and gynecology is kind of in<br>the middle so the gender pay gap doesn't<br>arise it's not just a question of having<br>you know a male and a female person<br>doing exactly the same job part of what<br>happens is that men tend to congregate<br>to high prestige high-paying fields and<br>women can congregate to lower pain<br>because if this happens in lore as well<br>if you look at law where do we find the<br>female lawyers and health law and family<br>law two of the most lowest paid<br>professions in law where do we find men<br>and banking and finance and civil<br>litigation okay so it's not just to do<br>with medicine this is kind of across the<br>board you might be thinking at this<br>point the solution right is just to have<br>active recruitment strategies where we<br>try and recruit women into orthopedics<br>and men into family medicine and<br>pediatrics<br>so this NIC studies are real kick in the<br>teeth um this is a study where they look<br>at 50 years of employment data a big<br>data analysis study in the US and found<br>that when women moved into occupations<br>and large numbers those jobs actually<br>began paying me<br>even after controlling for education<br>work experience skills race and<br>geography so it wasn't a question of<br>when you get women into those fields<br>they are buoyed up by the prestige and<br>the pay in that field the very presence<br>of women in that field decreases the<br>perceived value of that work okay so one<br>example was biology when women came into<br>the field of biology overall pay<br>decrease by 18 percent now the area was<br>designers when women increase the number<br>of designers overall pay decrease by 32<br>percent what's the explanation for this<br>it's that idea that when we look out in<br>the world and we see people that are<br>representations of people that are<br>brilliant competent leaders doing really<br>high value work that looks male right<br>and when we think about the work that<br>women do that seems to have less value<br>to us right this is kind of some of the<br>ways it plays out this is really<br>depressing ah but I think the point of<br>it is to kind of give you an indication<br>of how entrenched some of these biases<br>are and why quick fixes don't work okay<br>because this is kind of slippery fish<br>and that it's gonna take really<br>sustained effort to start trying to<br>rewire our assumptions about the value<br>of men and women's work alright a few<br>final comments before we finish so these<br>are just little bits of the puzzle I<br>want to put on the table I don't have<br>time through them justice but I think<br>it's kind of incomplete talk about bias<br>without mentioning these so that mean<br>nature versus nurture and unpaid work<br>there's a really important agenda around<br>the degree to which gender stereotypes<br>are damaging and dangerous for me so<br>yesterday was international men's day<br>actually thought for a minute you might<br>have scheduled villager did double check<br>that no it was yesterday I'm not today<br>alright so and stereotypes are on men<br>and masculine behavior either strength<br>and vulnerability stoicism risk-taking<br>in assertiveness so three examples of<br>how this plays out and really<br>imaging ways for men one is the suicide<br>rate so massively high suicide rates are<br>for men barrier to health seeking<br>behavior so men less likely to seek time<br>lead here for themselves with no<br>experience something this is one of the<br>contributing factors as to why men die<br>earlier so I say you know it's<br>problematic I feel kind of annoyed that<br>there's a gender pay gap and that we<br>don't get paid as much but men in the<br>audience should feel really bothered by<br>the fact that the gender stereotypes we<br>raise our children with means that you<br>lose the end of your life as a result of<br>some of these views about and<br>vulnerability social isolation so<br>research shows that with our male<br>children we speak much less with them<br>about relationships navigating difficult<br>emotional circumstances valuing and kind<br>of navigating social context and we<br>speak to our female children a lot more<br>about that one of the consequences of<br>this is that women tend to have to have<br>a much broader and deeper social network<br>than men and men are often quite reliant<br>on their spouse for their emotion and<br>psychology to make their kind of<br>emotional and psychological needs big<br>study in the u.s. hundred twenty seven<br>thousand people found that married men<br>are healthier and outlive their widowed<br>singled and divorced counterparts right<br>because men in those circumstances don't<br>have a broader social network to draw<br>women are experienced no survival<br>advantage in marriage so that was it was<br>kind of a unilateral relationship in<br>because women you know and again I'm<br>talking about generalizations tend to<br>have a much broader social network and<br>where they can have those needs me<br>alright so putting that out there isn't<br>a ginger native versus nurture sometimes<br>at this point it's really normal to<br>think look if these patterns are so well<br>documented across so many field maybe<br>some of this is nature and you know<br>there's a limit to how much we can<br>really expect things to change so here I<br>would just recommend you look at the<br>work of Cordelia fine kiss dosterone<br>Rick's which is her most recent book one<br>the science couple wouldn't 2017 it is a<br>fantastic read she's near a scientists<br>and philosophers she argues that well<br>you know possibly the only way to really<br>settle this debate would be to raise<br>children and a totally gender neutral<br>society which we don't have in the world<br>so that's kind of an answerable question<br>at the moment but what we do know about<br>the mind is that it's incredibly<br>malleable programmable and adaptable to<br>its environment<br>okay so kids by the age of two or three<br>have learnt to speak there's a<br>reasonably sophisticated skill and they<br>learn that by mimicking what they see<br>around them okay so children very young<br>can identify and start to mimic gendered<br>behavior so often parents who say you<br>know we're trying to write and I say<br>this myself we tried to raise our<br>children in a gender-neutral environment<br>and by the time they're five you know<br>three they're already expressing you<br>know quite gendered behavior and that's<br>perfectly plausible as a as a kind of<br>cultural process alright the last part<br>of the story it's unpaid work and so<br>this is my favorite work-life balance<br>photo this is me literally balancing my<br>home life on my head while I'm trying to<br>work and this was taken at 6:00 in the<br>morning when I had got up at 4:00 in the<br>morning to try and get some work done it<br>was a day that I was at home with the<br>kids and the kids were not supposed to<br>get up for sex but they had so I was<br>just ignoring them and my husband<br>snapped this photo arguing you know you<br>can't possibly work with a childhood<br>here like I've been here for the last 15<br>minutes while you were having a shower<br>so that is how I work um I think the<br>point here is that from a personal<br>perspective I I find it really hard to<br>identify you you know degrees to which<br>gender has held me back in my career I<br>am lucky in that I have a huge amount of<br>flexibility I have more opportunities<br>than I can say yes to so it's not kind<br>of a lack of stuff on the table but the<br>really limiting factor is the degree of<br>kind of cognitive and emotional and<br>physical energy I have when<br>get through the door and that totally<br>depends on what's going on and my home<br>life right so that's the bit that's been<br>tricky to balance I have never really<br>had to fight to get more opportunity to<br>work so this has to be part of a kind of<br>a discussion about gender in the<br>workplace so this is New Zealand data<br>right on the bottom here if you can see<br>it and so men and women have relatively<br>equals sleeping time in New Zealand<br>equal amounts of Sport time men have<br>significantly more leisure time and<br>women are doing dramatically more<br>routine housework and a lot more care<br>for household members and that you know<br>people that want to have children<br>particularly really limits the amount of<br>energy we have to lean in at work<br>all right so let's start talking about<br>some solutions um couple of interesting<br>books here so lean in by Sheryl Sandberg<br>talks about the degree to which women<br>have internalized some of these<br>stereotypes about gender in the<br>workplace and actually their behavior<br>holds them back there's some musical<br>content there I think I wouldn't buy it<br>kind of wholesale but there are some I<br>found this music advice there<br>essentially she argues you know you need<br>to feel the fear and do it anyway right<br>woman I need to be more risk-taking I<br>need to be more assertive in the<br>workplace one thing I do take away from<br>this book was she makes the point that<br>women need to carry it themselves a lot<br>at work right so and I what I had read<br>that I said looking at my emails I would<br>write things like well I think my<br>opinion possibly maybe we could consider<br>doing you know the following and so one<br>thing I'm taking away from it for<br>example is to write there but then edit<br>out all of that I think in my opinion<br>you know in the caveat before I send it<br>a Maurice Martha is kind of the the<br>response to Lena and so her criticism of<br>leaning is that it puts too much<br>pressure on women themselves to solve<br>this problem and that a lot of what we<br>need to be looking about kind of<br>structural issues of how we structure<br>parental leave for example in flexible<br>working hours and for example the Royal<br>College of Surgeons is really I think at<br>the moment trying to focus on<br>of all training options that don't<br>disappear a woman but appeal to people<br>that have kind of lives outside surgery<br>the wife drought is a great read why<br>women need wives and men need lives one<br>other point she makes here is that women<br>need to you know that it's it's not<br>culturally acceptable anymore for men<br>and a workplace to kind of go off and<br>play golf together and have you know<br>workplace conversations there but it's<br>still politically and socially<br>acceptable for women to get together and<br>you know complain about how incompetent<br>their husbands are in the house this was<br>really heartbreaking because there is<br>literally one of my favorite things to<br>do so pathetic things to do so it was<br>really for me really useful for her to<br>point out that engaging in that kind of<br>language is just perpetuating their<br>stereotypes that isn't necessarily<br>evidence base so research shows that men<br>men's brains aren't as good at<br>multitasking as women unless you put<br>them in the household environment after<br>a couple of years they do get better at<br>multitasking right so it's a lot to do<br>when in firemen we put people in rather<br>than their innate skills anyway<br>interesting material game what doesn't<br>work on unconscious bias decisions like<br>this so big meta-analysis in 2014 found<br>that education on bias teaching cross<br>cultural awareness or promoting kinda<br>make a Galit Aryan worldview simply<br>doesn't work for two reasons one a lot<br>of this is aimed at our conscious mind<br>rather than our unconscious mind and<br>there's often just a big disconnect<br>there and to because of the amount of<br>time right so if it's taken me 40 years<br>to build up my mental architecture that<br>it helps me interpret the world and a<br>half hour talk isn't gonna unright them<br>there are there is some building<br>evidence or a strategies that do work<br>and largely this comes down to that slow<br>thinking rather than the fast thinking<br>so we need to focus on action rather<br>than intention there's no point telling<br>people to be less biased or telling them<br>to be good people or either already are<br>good people so we need to put in place<br>action targets for workplaces and then<br>hold workplaces accountable<br>where they're meeting those targets<br>collecting data is hugely important<br>because it avoids that whole kind of<br>conversation about people's subjective<br>experience of the workplace right and<br>once we've got the data we can start<br>looking at how to address that issue<br>rather than debating about whether it<br>isn't issue setting key performance<br>indicators defining evaluation criteria<br>in advance again really helps cut down<br>that kind of instinctive gut response I<br>also think we shouldn't have any you<br>know sleepers like sometimes the Fitch<br>criteria is this person a good fit with<br>our workplace that in and of itself is<br>just biased right it's like to what<br>degree does this person fit with our<br>existing cultural assumptions about that<br>should be some of the lessons around<br>bias are that unsurprisingly diversity<br>and leadership teams are in the<br>workplace makes people uncomfortable it<br>is less comfortable to have to work with<br>people really outside the grouping your<br>mister working words that brings kind of<br>a different perspective and a different<br>set of skills but and this is much<br>easier to measure in the or profit<br>sector than the public sector higher<br>diversity me makes companies that are<br>more resilient and generate more profit<br>so it's uncomfortable sometimes it's<br>it's difficult but overall and improve<br>standards where we can measure them<br>blind review is really helpful out where<br>you can use that right because it cuts<br>down some of the bias I'm really in<br>favor of targets and quotas for a couple<br>of reasons<br>one I'm just really impatient it seems<br>like a quick strategy for me secondary<br>reasons are that point about discomfort<br>I think sometimes if we have quotas and<br>targets we get people in and it gives us<br>experience of working with different<br>leadership styles of seeing different<br>people present at conferences and the<br>more we see that the more we're<br>experiencing the world in a different<br>way and that is actually helping to<br>rewrite our bias right because bias<br>comes from experience not from kind of<br>cognitive engagement but the real<br>advantage of targets and quotas from my<br>perspective is that we are recreating<br>the world that<br>generation is experiencing so if we are<br>actively you know inviting speakers to<br>events that represent a diverse range of<br>people that is a really visible<br>demonstration for medical students or<br>you know young doctors around who whose<br>voice we want to hear great website<br>called bias interrupters org has a huge<br>number of kind of resources and<br>checklists essentially around slowing<br>down our thinking you can just print<br>them out if it's to do with you know<br>promotion or hiring job reviews and<br>really kind of fantastic usable<br>resources but as I said decision itself<br>my husband gets really annoyed at me<br>actually and this is kind of quite a<br>gene to think that I don't charge for<br>these sessions particularly when I'm<br>speaking to law firms and he's like that<br>is so gendered you're doing this talk on<br>unconscious bias and you're just holding<br>yourself back he used to work from a<br>convene company do you realize how much<br>I would charge if I was giving those<br>talks to law firms no I want to charge<br>for it and so my defense is I'm not<br>charging for it because it's not gonna<br>make any difference but he doesn't buy<br>that so you can make your own call on<br>that the degree to which it will make a<br>difference is if it prompts you to think<br>about your workplace and kind of<br>actually institute practices that<br>changed it so that's all I have to offer<br>you today but I'm really happy to take<br>questions and I'd love to hear about you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
