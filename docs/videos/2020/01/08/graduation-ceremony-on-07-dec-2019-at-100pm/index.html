tena koutou katoa Chancellor
vice-chancellor distinguished guests
colleagues families and graduates
congratulations grand jurors graduates
congratulations class of 2019 you made
it and hopefully with a hat without
having your noodle baked along the way
on to how many of you through Jesus can
remember that maybe you can't when
you're in third year you you're fun oh
and friends should be very proud of your
achievements today as we are staff we
are very proud to welcome you as
University alumni I'm honored to being
given the privilege of sharing this
occasion with you and to say a few words
of encouragement as you take the next
steps in your careers as
physiotherapists doctors scientists
lawyers and their many other directions
you may be hitting your entering
professions where your skills will make
a difference to the lives of many people
for years to come
not just to the individuals who you
treat but the Ferno and their
communities and your professions in
society as a whole it is the impact of
your actions on others
around which I wish to frame my address
to you today now many graduation
addresses begin with reflections from
the speaker as to water was like for
them all those years ago sitting about
where you sir are sitting right now
ma'am droning on when really only what
you want to do is get out of here have a
nice dinner with your family then
politely excuse yourself and go and get
Trollied am i right
I think I'm right well I hope my dress
doesn't end up generating the same
desire to escape but I do want however
to work my way towards some sticky
messages that maybe you'll recall and
the haziness that will be tomorrow
morning so first I will tell you a
little bit about myself so that you know
where my messages are coming from so
I've certainly taken an unconventional
Road myself to get here but it's taught
me that about the need to frequently put
myself out of my comfort zone and aim
for something that will not only benefit
me but for others as well so I was first
a first in my family University attendee
from the poor side of the tracks and
Hastings going to uni for me from school
was an unrealistic dream to a due to a
lack of resources and support networks
to help me negotiate the challenges the
steps that led to University we were
very many and as diverse as working as a
Rousey sorting the wool from the digs
and clearing the troughs on a sheep farm
to working as an electronic technician
in a hospital where my first assigned
job as the junior was repairing a
strange-looking and foul-smelling object
that turned out to be an unsuitable
device for control and fecal
incontinence
I guess these experience for valuable
metaphors for what was to come on my
later years as a junior doctor something
to look forward to so from the year I
shifted to designing and selling medical
electronics equipment so my career in
sales was always going to be quite short
because I was a little bit too honest
about what I was selling however it was
the contact on that job with people in
the community who were vulnerable and in
need of support that really triggered my
desire to go to medical school to learn
more so if I went to Dunedin to do
Health Sciences first year or its
equivalent in 1989 so having a nun
sufficient science background and coming
from the social background I did meet
that I felt very much like a fish out of
water at university I mean if you may
understand that feeling and it was a
struggle that I frequently reflect on in
my current job as the director of the
Health Sciences first-year program
from there my journey led me to working
to help people rehabilitate from brain
disorders and latterly trying to develop
new tools and therapies to maximize the
quality of life for people living with
stroke and Parkinson's disease very
satisfying career
so now that I've reflected on what
brought me here you might like to
remember your own journey particularly
our Health Sciences first year which
most of you will have done do you
remember how challenging that year was
and how much you're expected to cram
into your noodle and how that year was a
very inconvenient barrier to a normal
social life so you may not remember
yourselves but in 2014 and 15 when most
of you'll have gone through the program
that you filled out a survey throughout
your year about your experiences that
year that survey and literally the
thousands of comments were read and
noted by our committee when we started
the process of change in 2016 one
particular comment resonated with me and
perhaps the authors here
well I'm pleased and I hope that where
perhaps we have sorted our out by
now but the point is that your feedback
has formed the background of the changes
to our redesign program which has just
completed its first year so thank you to
you all for your honesty your words and
actions have had a positive impact on
those that follow one of the changes we
introduced this year which I'm immensely
proud there's teaching directly from
scholars and the humanities we've
challenged first years this year to
think beyond the physiology anatomy and
biochemistry of the organ systems and
begin to understand how individuals form
their beliefs about their own and others
health and the societal and cultural
factors that contribute to those beliefs
why put us in first year I was often
asked well my belief was and remains
that this is a framework that is
fundamental to students development as
empathic humans right from the start
David Muller Dean of medical education
at Mount Sinai School of Medicine
recently wrote Sciences the foundation
of an excellent medical education
but a well-rounded humanist is best
suited to make the most of that
education so when considering humanity
we have seen tremendous acts of
compassion and forgiveness from your
peers in the wake of the Christchurch
Moss shooting of March 15 at our Dunedin
University campus I want to make special
mention of our USA president James Heath
our Muslim University Students
Association president Hamza Abed at and
the chairman of our Otago Muslim
Association Muhammad Roslin who all
showed outstanding leadership and
courage at a time in our community felt
very frightened and vulnerable those of
you in Christchurch I know that you
readily offered your services to the
community directly affected by this
tragedy I renewing to you all finally
before I quite get on to the sticky
messages I wanted to mention briefly
about reading that one of your number a
couple of weeks ago survived a
spectacular fall of 600 meters while
climbing and I'm very very happy to see
that she's here graduating today well
done
she's taught us that spectacular Falls
are survivable and I'm sure she's
already planning the next mountain to
climb EPS I'm right now if I may I may I
want us to consider this as a metaphor
for us all to learn from when
considering the recent events that have
hit the media which have affected many
of you students here in your colleagues
or elsewhere today as clinicians we need
to move forward from this fall and climb
back to a position of respect and Trust
in the eyes of our community for those
affected directly this will not be what
defines you it will be your actions and
words subsequently and your compassion
finally for the sticky messages so you
can go
I've unashamedly co-opted three words
that we need to remember in the event of
a particular type of natural disaster
that we can apply to ravine to us
prevent progressing towards a disaster
of a different kind the message is very
simple drop cover and hold drop drop the
act be genuine in your interactions with
people take the time to listen to
people's stories you'll learn a lot
about them as well as yourself cover
cover all bases with your care think of
the whole person and the many roles that
they need to play and understand how
your actions as a health professional
impact on all of these aspects of their
life hold hold on to your humanity the
world is going to need your humanity and
leadership as we never get these
unfathomable times in the upside down of
fake news unpredictable referenda
results denial of scientific evidence
and preference to memes on social media
an unexpected incidence of
unquestionable hatred embrace the
amazing work you will all do helping
people get back on their feet in the
case of our physiotherapists literally
infrequently and get up every day
excited by the difference you can make
in the recovery process understand that
the impact you will all have as greater
than the therapy you will deliver it is
the humanity and compassion that you
show for that person and the care for
their quality of life going forward that
will make all the difference
drop the Act cover all bases with your
care hold on to humanity congratulations
again graduates and I mean he knew it
Kyoto

address this afternoon we thoroughly

you again to join with me in thanking
professor John Reynolds for his fine
graduation
on behalf of the University Council I
thank you again for sharing in the
celebration particularly those of you
who have travelled long distances to be
here I wish you a safe journey home I
also wish to thank the vice-chancellor
professor Haines and our academic and
professional staff at all of the
University of Otago campuses throughout
New Zealand for their outstanding
contribution to ensuring that our
students benefit from the immense up a
tree power of an excellent university

me in expressing appreciation to our
staff

yourselves and to those among whom you
live the academic and some Guardi Alice
will now be sung the words are printed
inside the back cover of the graduation
booklet please stand for the anthem and
