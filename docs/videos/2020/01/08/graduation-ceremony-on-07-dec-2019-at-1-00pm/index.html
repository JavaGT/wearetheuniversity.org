to deliver the graduation<br>address<br>tena koutou katoa Chancellor<br>vice-chancellor distinguished guests<br>colleagues families and graduates<br>congratulations grand jurors graduates<br>congratulations class of 2019 you made<br>it and hopefully with a hat without<br>having your noodle baked along the way<br>on to how many of you through Jesus can<br>remember that maybe you can't when<br>you're in third year you you're fun oh<br>and friends should be very proud of your<br>achievements today as we are staff we<br>are very proud to welcome you as<br>University alumni I'm honored to being<br>given the privilege of sharing this<br>occasion with you and to say a few words<br>of encouragement as you take the next<br>steps in your careers as<br>physiotherapists doctors scientists<br>lawyers and their many other directions<br>you may be hitting your entering<br>professions where your skills will make<br>a difference to the lives of many people<br>for years to come<br>not just to the individuals who you<br>treat but the Ferno and their<br>communities and your professions in<br>society as a whole it is the impact of<br>your actions on others<br>around which I wish to frame my address<br>to you today now many graduation<br>addresses begin with reflections from<br>the speaker as to water was like for<br>them all those years ago sitting about<br>where you sir are sitting right now<br>ma'am droning on when really only what<br>you want to do is get out of here have a<br>nice dinner with your family then<br>politely excuse yourself and go and get<br>Trollied am i right<br>I think I'm right well I hope my dress<br>doesn't end up generating the same<br>desire to escape but I do want however<br>to work my way towards some sticky<br>messages that maybe you'll recall and<br>the haziness that will be tomorrow<br>morning so first I will tell you a<br>little bit about myself so that you know<br>where my messages are coming from so<br>I've certainly taken an unconventional<br>Road myself to get here but it's taught<br>me that about the need to frequently put<br>myself out of my comfort zone and aim<br>for something that will not only benefit<br>me but for others as well so I was first<br>a first in my family University attendee<br>from the poor side of the tracks and<br>Hastings going to uni for me from school<br>was an unrealistic dream to a due to a<br>lack of resources and support networks<br>to help me negotiate the challenges the<br>steps that led to University we were<br>very many and as diverse as working as a<br>Rousey sorting the wool from the digs<br>and clearing the troughs on a sheep farm<br>to working as an electronic technician<br>in a hospital where my first assigned<br>job as the junior was repairing a<br>strange-looking and foul-smelling object<br>that turned out to be an unsuitable<br>device for control and fecal<br>incontinence<br>I guess these experience for valuable<br>metaphors for what was to come on my<br>later years as a junior doctor something<br>to look forward to so from the year I<br>shifted to designing and selling medical<br>electronics equipment so my career in<br>sales was always going to be quite short<br>because I was a little bit too honest<br>about what I was selling however it was<br>the contact on that job with people in<br>the community who were vulnerable and in<br>need of support that really triggered my<br>desire to go to medical school to learn<br>more so if I went to Dunedin to do<br>Health Sciences first year or its<br>equivalent in 1989 so having a nun<br>sufficient science background and coming<br>from the social background I did meet<br>that I felt very much like a fish out of<br>water at university I mean if you may<br>understand that feeling and it was a<br>struggle that I frequently reflect on in<br>my current job as the director of the<br>Health Sciences first-year program<br>from there my journey led me to working<br>to help people rehabilitate from brain<br>disorders and latterly trying to develop<br>new tools and therapies to maximize the<br>quality of life for people living with<br>stroke and Parkinson's disease very<br>satisfying career<br>so now that I've reflected on what<br>brought me here you might like to<br>remember your own journey particularly<br>our Health Sciences first year which<br>most of you will have done do you<br>remember how challenging that year was<br>and how much you're expected to cram<br>into your noodle and how that year was a<br>very inconvenient barrier to a normal<br>social life so you may not remember<br>yourselves but in 2014 and 15 when most<br>of you'll have gone through the program<br>that you filled out a survey throughout<br>your year about your experiences that<br>year that survey and literally the<br>thousands of comments were read and<br>noted by our committee when we started<br>the process of change in 2016 one<br>particular comment resonated with me and<br>perhaps the authors here<br>well I'm pleased and I hope that where<br>perhaps we have sorted our out by<br>now but the point is that your feedback<br>has formed the background of the changes<br>to our redesign program which has just<br>completed its first year so thank you to<br>you all for your honesty your words and<br>actions have had a positive impact on<br>those that follow one of the changes we<br>introduced this year which I'm immensely<br>proud there's teaching directly from<br>scholars and the humanities we've<br>challenged first years this year to<br>think beyond the physiology anatomy and<br>biochemistry of the organ systems and<br>begin to understand how individuals form<br>their beliefs about their own and others<br>health and the societal and cultural<br>factors that contribute to those beliefs<br>why put us in first year I was often<br>asked well my belief was and remains<br>that this is a framework that is<br>fundamental to students development as<br>empathic humans right from the start<br>David Muller Dean of medical education<br>at Mount Sinai School of Medicine<br>recently wrote Sciences the foundation<br>of an excellent medical education<br>but a well-rounded humanist is best<br>suited to make the most of that<br>education so when considering humanity<br>we have seen tremendous acts of<br>compassion and forgiveness from your<br>peers in the wake of the Christchurch<br>Moss shooting of March 15 at our Dunedin<br>University campus I want to make special<br>mention of our USA president James Heath<br>our Muslim University Students<br>Association president Hamza Abed at and<br>the chairman of our Otago Muslim<br>Association Muhammad Roslin who all<br>showed outstanding leadership and<br>courage at a time in our community felt<br>very frightened and vulnerable those of<br>you in Christchurch I know that you<br>readily offered your services to the<br>community directly affected by this<br>tragedy I renewing to you all finally<br>before I quite get on to the sticky<br>messages I wanted to mention briefly<br>about reading that one of your number a<br>couple of weeks ago survived a<br>spectacular fall of 600 meters while<br>climbing and I'm very very happy to see<br>that she's here graduating today well<br>done<br>she's taught us that spectacular Falls<br>are survivable and I'm sure she's<br>already planning the next mountain to<br>climb EPS I'm right now if I may I may I<br>want us to consider this as a metaphor<br>for us all to learn from when<br>considering the recent events that have<br>hit the media which have affected many<br>of you students here in your colleagues<br>or elsewhere today as clinicians we need<br>to move forward from this fall and climb<br>back to a position of respect and Trust<br>in the eyes of our community for those<br>affected directly this will not be what<br>defines you it will be your actions and<br>words subsequently and your compassion<br>finally for the sticky messages so you<br>can go<br>I've unashamedly co-opted three words<br>that we need to remember in the event of<br>a particular type of natural disaster<br>that we can apply to ravine to us<br>prevent progressing towards a disaster<br>of a different kind the message is very<br>simple drop cover and hold drop drop the<br>act be genuine in your interactions with<br>people take the time to listen to<br>people's stories you'll learn a lot<br>about them as well as yourself cover<br>cover all bases with your care think of<br>the whole person and the many roles that<br>they need to play and understand how<br>your actions as a health professional<br>impact on all of these aspects of their<br>life hold hold on to your humanity the<br>world is going to need your humanity and<br>leadership as we never get these<br>unfathomable times in the upside down of<br>fake news unpredictable referenda<br>results denial of scientific evidence<br>and preference to memes on social media<br>an unexpected incidence of<br>unquestionable hatred embrace the<br>amazing work you will all do helping<br>people get back on their feet in the<br>case of our physiotherapists literally<br>infrequently and get up every day<br>excited by the difference you can make<br>in the recovery process understand that<br>the impact you will all have as greater<br>than the therapy you will deliver it is<br>the humanity and compassion that you<br>show for that person and the care for<br>their quality of life going forward that<br>will make all the difference<br>drop the Act cover all bases with your<br>care hold on to humanity congratulations<br>again graduates and I mean he knew it<br>Kyoto<br>thank you very much professor Reynolds<br>for your very insightful and engaging<br>address this afternoon we thoroughly<br>enjoyed hearing about your background<br>the development of your career and the<br>principles that inform your values I'm<br>confident that your sage advice would<br>have inspired today's graduates I'd ask<br>you again to join with me in thanking<br>professor John Reynolds for his fine<br>graduation<br>on behalf of the University Council
