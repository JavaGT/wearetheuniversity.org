please be seated I now call on the
public orator to present a candidate for
an honorary degree Bill Robertson grew
up on a sheep farm in the Huayra Valley
near Blenheim he attended a series of
country schools the first of which had
just nine pupils he was he says not as
good at paying attention as he might
have been he did a year of high school
by correspondence which didn't work out
so well and eventually left to attendant
beads College as a boarder as the end of
school wound bill was still unsure about
his future career he considered the Navy
and civil engineering but the problem
was solved by a chance encounter with a
lands and survey officer who asked that
most fundamental question what do you
like build really liked being outdoors
in the wild
traveling hunting fishing what was he
good at well he had a head for numbers
he was good at trigonometry it was
settled bill began his working life in
1954 as a drafting cadet with the lands
and survey Department as bill tells it
he wasn't really neat enough for
drafting fortunately he was soon
appointed a survey cadet so began the
long and illustrious career of one of
New Zealand's great public servants who
would eventually become surveyor-general
and director general of the department
of survey and land information bills
work would help to make fundamental
changes to many aspects of New Zealand
life that most of us take for granted
planning a trip exploring a national
park
buying a house voting surveying would
take bill deep into the our taro and New
Zealand backcountry South to Antarctica
north to Malaysia and across the globe
as a land administration expert working
for NZ aid the World Bank the UN Food
and Agriculture Organization and to the
Middle East and Africa where he helped
determine the borders of disputed the
locations of disputed international
borders including the Iraq Kuwait border
after the Gulf War the work was
challenging physically personally and
sometimes politically Bill's early
career was full of travel which he loved
but eventually moving from house to
house 13 of them in all became too
difficult bill took a job at head office
in Wellington where he finally settled
down with his wife Judy and their
growing family
mark-paul Peter and Hamish we welcome
Judy Mark and Bill's sister Kay here to
celebrate with us today
bill adapted to his new life and head
office and it soon became clear that as
well as an excellent surveyor he was
also an exceptional leader colleagues
described bill as judging his own
success by how well he helped others to
succeed bill they say was always
forward-looking particularly interested
in how new technology might change the
department what were the opportunities
what would staff have to learn how could
bill was also alert to social change he
recognized early the significance of
biculturalism in the public service he
actively encouraged the recognition of T
Conger and promoted the importance of
Tyrael and was determined that the
department would become a trusted source
of information for Marty in the
resolution of land claims a surveyor
general and dejected and director
general of the department of survey and
land information from 1987 to 1996 bill
chaired the New Zealand Geographic board
and he was part of an effort to ensure
that our place names reflect the full
sweep of our country's history he also
chaired the Electoral Commission
instituting processes that strengthened
New Zealand's enviable tradition of
neutrality in the drawing of electoral
boundaries throughout his career bill
has been a consistent supporter of the
University of Otago and its National
School of surveying he worked closely
with Professor basil Jones to establish
three BSC degrees which he then
supported by moving technical staff to
Dunedin so that they could enroll as
full-time students this upskilling
produced a generation of men and women
who formed the backbone for many of the
digital mapping innovations subsequently
undertaken by the department what was
his most important achievement there are
many to choose from but bill
well remembers the day he was told by
then Finance Minister Roger Douglas that
the department could no longer be
primarily funded by tax payers it would
have to earn its way through charging
for services and its budget would be cut
by 50% which turned out to be 70% there
was a real chance that the department
would be broken up and it's proud record
of an innovation lost scattering it's
bright young staff whom bill had done so
much to develop but Bill believes that
challenges are opportunities what
matters is how you adapt bills
colleagues describe him as always
seeming to be one step ahead always
having a clear vision of the way forward
under his leadership the department
survived and adapted to become a world
leader amongst such organisations and
that was possible because bill is
essentially an optimist who believes in
the people with whom he works and
believes in the power of innovation
above all bill Robertson is driven by a
fundamental ethic of service to our Tara
and its people

it or steal it

honors in May 2002 she is global service
leader for land and for structure and
spatial insights at the global
engineering consultancy firm or a calm
and is based in Auckland Rebecca has
recently completed a two-year term as
president of survey and spatial New
Zealand formerly known as the New
Zealand Institute of surveyors she was
the first female president in the
organisation's a hundred thirty year
history
Rebecca is an outstanding leader of her
profession so please join with me in
welcoming Rebecca strain to deliver the
graduation of Trees
tena koutou katoa I'd like to
acknowledge manaphy nieuwe distinguished
guests Bill Robertson Chancellor Pro
Vice Chancellors Pro Chancellor's vice
chancellor council and staff of
university of otago and all of you the
graduates of 2019 and preparing for this
address
I spent a considerable amount of time
reflecting or in other words
procrastinating on a series of events
that have occurred in my career since I
graduated from the University of Otago
with a Bachelor of surveying degree I
also pondered what I was thinking that I
was in your position sitting in this
beautiful building listening to a
similar address 18 or 19 years is a
fairly long time for me of you that's
almost a lifetime and considering I can
barely recall what happened last week I
had little confidence that I remember
too much and to be honest I even forgot
what year I graduated when I gave my
biography embarrassing I do recall
though feeling a bit overwhelmed does it
suddenly dawned on me that a major
chapter of my life was ending and I was
stepping out into the real world no
longer would life be handed to me on a
plate with others telling me what was
required and win now that I had letters
after my name it was reasonable for
others to expect that I knew something
useful the pressure anyone else feeling
that today I'm incredibly grateful to
say that since then I've had a great
time when I was invited to give this
address which is a huge honor
thank you again vice-chancellor I have
to admit when I got the phone call
my first thought was was I in trouble
and my second thought was why me
anyway I was informed one of the
objectives could be to leave one message
that graduates will remember for the
rest of their lives it's no mean feat
and I hope you'll have better memories
than I do I'm gonna start by asking you
to imagine yourselves
doing a similar address and around 20
years time how will the world our
country your community your profession
have changed socially politically
environmentally and economically what
will you have done to improve it what's
important to you
today I'm going to talk about taking
opportunities expecting change and being
human when I think back to the work
environment I stepped into as a fresh
graduate at the end of 2001 a lot has
changed in a relatively short amount of
time back then we drew legal survey
plans on a1 sheets of paper with
drafting pins we recorded our precise
distance and angle measurements in a
field notebook with pencil and only if
there were hundreds of measurements that
we use an electronic data recorder
formal communication to clients and
external organizations was via fax or
word process letters emails were use but
not extensively and everything was
printed off and hardcopy for filing and
I can distinctly recall being nervous
about phone calls because that meant I
had to think on my feet and I was
worried my work colleagues but listen to
what I was saying and view me is
incompetent this was in the days of
landlines Mobile's weren't commonly used
for business and this we were working in
a different part of the country so you
couldn't just stand up and wander off
into a quieter part of the office the
privacy fast water today we have
open-plan offices with hot discs
collaboration spaces quiet pods and mini
computer systems of cloud-based and
accessible from any mobile device half a
time you don't even need to be
physically in an office I realize you've
probably heard many similar stories from
members of your own family and your
lecturers and tutors here at University
the reason I'm mentioning it is that
with the current rate of technological
change the workplaces and work culture
that many of you will step into will be
vastly different to what others before
you have experienced for some of you the
environment will be more bet
than you expect I've just spent the last
two two-and-a-half years leading digital
transformation in New Zealand at the at
a sane engineering consultancy firm I
joined as a graduate survey I've known
so much during this time mostly about
human nature and how to be a bit of
person myself I've definitely been
operating outside my comfort zone but
it's also allowed me to improve my
communication skills and try to see
things from other people's perspectives
there are two points I want to make in
relation to this experience one all
industries are being digitized it's very
likely that the organisation you go into
may look to you for your ideas on
technology in culture because you are
digital natives who knows what the
workplace of 2039 will look like it's
likely that change will be a constant
for you and even more than it is for
today's workers today so I'd recommend
you strap yourselves in for the ride and
try to get comfortable with being
uncomfortable don't be afraid to change
tack if an opportunity arises to do
something different that interest you
it's point to you'll undoubtedly learn
new skills and meet different people
around about the same time that I took
up the digital role I was elected as
president of survey in special New
Zealand which is a voluntary role in a
professional membership organisation
I've just completed that two-year term
the thing I like most about being part
of a professional body is the
realization that you are part of
something bigger than yourself
I found that I've got out just as much
as I put in by being part of survey and
special New Zealand I got the
opportunity to meet amazing dedicated
people like Bill here from all parts of
New Zealand as well as all over the
world some of these people who become
really good friends and many of them
have supported me in a mentoring
capacity over the years and in a number
of those people are here today so it's
wonderful to see you all I'd highly
recommend you consider you're getting in
getting yourself involved in the
professional girl group yourself when
you start working many have young
professional divisions and these provide
a lot of support as you never get your
way through your career if I'm honest I
have to say it was full
for both me and my family having two
leadership roles concurrently and I
possibly wouldn't recommend it having
said that I recently changed roles again
back to my core area of expertise
leading surveying civil engineering of
geospatial globally for Oregon without
having challenged myself to dive into
the two roles I doubt I would have
developed the skills and confidence to
go for my current role and I probably
wouldn't be standing here before you
today you would have heard that
old it as the best things in life don't
come for free the true truth is they
often require a lot of elbow grease and
perseverance there will be times when
everything does not go to plan one of
the hardest lessons I learnt at work was
that when I was faced with a problem
that I felt I had to tackle by myself
remember when I sit at the start of this
address that I start I feel like I
should know a lot when I graduated as a
qualified professional it's hard not to
have a high expectations of yourself and
to find the balance between taking
ownership in asking colleagues for help
in order to solve a problem I once made
a mistake of not flagging an issue early
it might have been the toughest listen
ever but it was a valuable one I learned
more from that one bad project than ten
good ones the point is we're all human
and we all make mistakes when the
inevitable happens to you try not to
beat yourself up too much learn from it
and share your lessons with others
speaking about being human no doubt you
will be aware that many jobs across all
sectors are becoming increasingly
automated and some of you may be
concerned about this but I don't think
you should be there will always be a
need for humans to collaborate to
provide value through building
relationships in communicating with
others to ensure the right problems are
being solved as the world's big
challenges such as poverty and climate
change are becoming more complex and
interrelated the ability to collaborate
with others to pull knowledge and solve
them collectively becomes essential
these days no one individual profession
organization can hope to have all the
information needed to fit all the jigsaw
puzzle pieces together my advice here is
to always bear in mind that other
people's experiences and opinions
matters as much and can be as helpful as
your own so learn to engage your brain
before your mouth yes your contribution
matters but you are just one cog in the
machine both of the roles I've recently
been and have certainly reinforced it to
me
finally can I remind you to be grateful
for the fact you're graduating today
grateful that you've had the support of
your family the University of Otago and
the Dunedin community grateful for the
people who are sitting beside you today
your friends and classmates the world's
a small place and you'll find them the
years to come
that the relationships you've
established at university are really
important grateful that you live in a
country where there are few barriers to
receiving education for those of you who
have already secured employment be
grateful for your employers never stop
being grateful especially for the
seemingly simple things in life that we
take for granted
clean air sunshine beautiful scenery
health family and friends there will
come a time in your life if you haven't
been there already when you realize it's
not the material things that matter at
the end of the day you've come to
university to build a foundation of
technical knowledge you've met all sorts
of interesting people and you've broaden
your horizons along the way now it's
your duty to use that knowledge in those
experiences to help make the world a
better place not everyone has the
privilege of attending University so
make sure you make the most of it and
finally don't forget to have fun I wish
you all the very best for your future

to see
