to present a candidate for an honorary
degree
so a large corporate a New Zealand or
international your workforce needs to be
working with you therefore treat people
as you would like to be treated people
provide solutions to problems poor
results inevitably follow poor behavior
but you should act ethically not just
for business reasons but because it's
the right thing to do these were John
judges words to students and staff in
2016 when he was the inaugural executive
in residence at the University of Otago
School of Business on that visit yet
returned to his roots in Dunedin
enchanting our students with a range of
compelling insights drawn from a long
and hugely successful career here was a
boy from Dunedin with the be common
accounting who had risen to become the
chief executive of Ernst and Young one
of the four titans of Financial Services
in New Zealand and chair of A&amp;amp;Z Bank
which became under his tenure the
largest bank in New Zealand what our
staff and students recognized was that
here was a true leader with a broad and
sharp intellect a humane outlook on
business and life you'd also a down to
earth an approachable manner and most
importantly a sponge supporter of this
university in this city John grew up in
Northeast Valley and early in his final
year at OU Targo boys high school
wandered down the hill to ask if he
could jump ahead a year in enroll late
at the University of Otago initially
studying maths John's intellectual
talent was recognized with an invitation
to join the honors stream but as he put
it he wanted to study something more
related to the real world and switched
to accounting his roving intellect and
evident ability saw him become involved
in a great number of actions that have
helped shape this university he was
elected onto the executive of ou USA and
became the student rep to the University
Council
he helped secure the loan that purchased
what became the clubs and societies
building on Albany Street along with
negotiating the purchase of the old
would cool store to become the unit
a bookshop his efforts as a student
leader shaped the campus that we wander
through today it was clear when he
graduated that he was destined to be a
leader in his field when I asked him to
reflect on his time as a student John
said the following why did I toggle I
learned much from being exposed to ideas
which challenged and threatened what I
believed in accepting others rights to
express ideas which I found confronting
and by learning to debate them and think
them through has helped me immensely for
all of my life to date joining Ernst &amp;amp;
Young is a junior accountant in 1974 his
interest in the wider world took him to
the company's offices in London this was
an exciting time to be working in
financial services john was fully awake
to the potential of the more integrated
global economy that was beginning to
emerge having been on hand for the
genesis moments of the emergence of
london as a global financial hub john
then returned home to New Zealand in
1983 again showing that instinct for
arriving somewhere just as big changes
were about to take place he was quickly
made partner in Ernst &amp;amp; Young thrived in
the burgeoning world of financial
services in New Zealand in the 1980s and
was appointed chief executive in 1995
retiring from their position in 2007
from the ajaan has served in leadership
roles in a range of prominent commercial
organizations including the accident
compensation corporation fletcher
building and gloucester insurance he
considers that his most important role
through that time was as chair of ANZ
Bank where he led the successful merger
of ANZ at a national to become New
Zealand's largest bank in 2012
finally is befitting someone who
strongly espouses broadness of intellect
he has served as a leader of many arts
and cultural organisations including the
Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa
and the Auckland art gallery foundation
John has played an important role at OU
Tago in recent years serving on the
advisory board of the school of business
mentoring staff and students and
the graduation address in 2012 when
discussing his honorary degree with him
recently he reflected on his first
capping by the University of us I
realized that many of the benefits I
enjoyed while at o-tar had been provided
fought and paid for by those who came
before me I decided then that I would
contribute in the same way to as many
organizations as possible without asking
for recompense this honorary doctorate
is a far greater reward and more
meaningful to me than any other honor
that I which I could have received thank
you we welcome John back here today
delighted and proud that one of our own
who achieved so much before he even
graduated from this university now gets
the chance to return and be honored for
everything he has achieved since that

performer in operatic productions
he has just completed a Bachelor of Arts

Dennis is Blair professor of music and
head of classical performance at the
University of Otago professor Denis is
acclaimed as one of New Zealand's finest
musicians and is a longtime accompanist
of Dame Kiri Te Kanawa it gives me great
pleasure to invite them to perform to us
I wonder what he'll think of me I guess
he'll call me the old man I guess you'll
think I can lick every other fellas
father but you have more common sense
than his pudding-headed father ever I'll
teach him to wrestle and I threw away
when we go in the mornings for a swim
his mother can teach him the way to
behave but she won't make a out of
bill my boy bill I will see that he's
named after me I will my boy bill he'll
be tall and as tough as a tree we'll
bill Mike a tree he'll grow with his
head held high and his feet planted
firmly grounded see nobody dare to try
to boss him or toss him around no pot
I don't give a damn what he does as long
as he does what he likes he can sit in
his tail on a rail with a hammer in
spikes he can ferry a boat on a river or
peddle a pack on his back or work up and
down the streets of the town with her
within a horse in a hack he can horse
cow along a canal run a cow around the
corral or maybe bark for a carousel of
course it takes talent to do that he
might be a champion heavy weights lolz
balloon or President of the United
States mad at me alright
it's mother would like that but he
wouldn't be present unless he wanted to
be a tree will bear like a tree who grow
with his head held high and his feet
planted firmly grounded you won't see
nobody dare to try to boss him or toss
him around no fat-bottomed flammie peas
pot-bellied Peggy I'd bastard will boss
him and I'm damned if you marry his
boss's daughter a skinny Lipton virgin
with blood like water who give him a
pitch call it a kiss look at his eye
through a lawn yet say why am i taking
on like this my kid ain't even been born
yet I can see him 2017 or so and
starting him to go
I can give him lots of pointers very
sound on the way to get round any girl I
can tell him wait a minute
could it be what the hell what if he is
a it's a girl bill
Oh
what would I do with her what could I do
for her a bum with no money you can have
fun with a son but you gotta be a father
too
she might not be so bad at that a kid
with ribbons in her hair a kind of neat
my little girl peaches and again as
bright as girls are meant
many a likely lad does what he can to
she has a few pink and white young
fellas of two or three but my little
girl gets hungry every night and she
comes home I gotta get ready before she
comes
I gotta make certain that she won't be
dragged up in slums with a lot of bums
she's gotta be sheltered and fed and
dressed in the best that money can boy I
never knew how to make money but I'll
try by God I'll try I'll go out and make
it or steal it
okay
Oh
thank you for their splendid performance
that now gives me great pleasure to
welcome today's graduation speaker
Sharon Behn
turn out who is the university's chief
financial officer Sharon is a proud
graduate of the University of Otago she
attended university past part-time while
working as a clerical cadet at the Otago
Education Board and later as a
management accountant for the New
Zealand salmon company
Sharon then headed to the United Kingdom
for her Oh II and a first job there was
with what was then the public health
laboratory service she was later
employed by the National Blood Service
soon after it was founded and had a
number of positions here over a 10-year
period her next major role was head of
corporate accounting with Transport for
London where she was involved in the
restructuring of finance and accounting
and creating and heading a centralised
finance advisory unit after an extensive
and very successful commercial career in
the United Kingdom
she decided the time was right to return
to Dunedin in 2014 and took up the role
of chief financial officer at the
University of Otago please join me in
welcoming Sharon Venter now to deliver
the graduation address
anger mana anger day oh ma we miner her
FR denna koto na koto tenets are
Tokugawa greetings to all Chancellor
Pro Chancellor Vice Chancellor members
of University Council
dr. judge colleagues friends and far No
and most importantly to you graduates I
have the privilege to be the chief
financial officer of this amazing
University but 32 years ago I was
sitting right where you are now when I
graduated from Otago with my Bachelor of
Commerce never in my wildest dreams
about where my life might lead could I
have imagined a future where I would be
standing in front of you all and my word
there are a lot of you having been given
the responsibility to share some
thoughts and advice with you on this
momentous day in your lives most
importantly congratulations to you all
on your achievement and a very warm
welcome to your family and friends who
have come today to join in your
celebration being asked to give the
graduation address is not an honour to
be taken lightly part of the brief
speakers received is that we should try
to make the address interesting enough
to be remembered in the future now
that's a tough gig particularly for an
accountant as part of my preparation for
today I looked up some suggestions for
the collective noun for accountants
someone offer were a balance of
accountants a spreadsheet of accountants
and my personal favorite a fudge of
accountants
and the interests of balance I also
looked up some collective nouns for
lawyers and can offer up an argument of
lawyers a verbosity of barristers and
the rather lovely and eloquence of
lawyers I was born a bit north of here
and Palmerston Easter Targo and spent
most of my early years in Dunedin I was
born into a fairly typical New Zealand
family we weren't well off but for as
long as I can remember I was going to
university I don't remember ever having
that conversation with my mum but I
always knew that that was what was going
to happen I come from a long line of
hard-working successful people but like
around a third of you who are graduating
today I was the first in my family to
attend university even so to you today a
university education doesn't seem an
unusual ambition for your child but in
1969 when I was five which is about as
far back as I can remember and must have
been about the time when my mum hatched
this University plan only 2% of New
Zealanders had a university degree while
studying I worked for 30 hours a week
and in effect studied half time so it
took me six years to finish my degree
partway through my studies I moved to
the new zealand salmon company I was
only 22 and really fell on my feet as I
was very fortunate to work with some
amazing people there our chief executive
was Peter Townsend the chairman was Ian
ferrant and one of a group of
illustrious directors was John judge you
have already heard today about John's
incredible career but I would like to
share some of the things about John and
my time at New Zealand salmon company
that have been instrumental in shaping
my own career new zealand salmon was a
high-risk endeavor and we were the first
company to move move New Zealand from
hunting salmon to farming it in the
ocean
John had an uncanny ability to operate
in this high-risk environment in a safe
way he ensured that the company always
had equity available to fall back on if
needed and boy we needed it we went
through a terrible two-year period where
we suffered an algal bloom at our fish
farm in Stewart Island and lost most of
our salmon stock and in the following
year our tomato farm in Gisborne fell
victim to cyclone bowl blur the company
couldn't sustain these levels of loss
and when the company was finally wound
up in 1992 thanks to John there was
still some funds left to make repayment
to shareholders New Zealand salmon was a
fledgling company when I joined and it
had an amazing culture and was led by
group of energetic intelligent brave and
slightly crazy people
it was incredibly egalitarian and we all
felt part of a team that was encouraged
to be bold and to take calculated and
considered risks just give it a go try
hard and if it doesn't work out then
pick yourself up dust yourself off and
think of something else to try we were
only a small team of around 10 people at
the head office but we've all gone on to
have very successful careers which was
made possible by the leadership shown by
John and his fellow directors thank you
John
we also had a lot of fun in preparing
this address I was reminded of a time
when Keith nailin was flying some of the
directors to Gisborne after celebrating
celebratory night out John had the bad
luck to be sitting next to the door
which flew open just after takeoff at
about 500 feet various commercial
flights had to be redirected so the
plane could reel and apparently Keith
calmly reached across John slammed the
door shut and off they went again I'm
not so sure how come John was feeling at
the time you have heard that John was
instrumental in the purchase of the
University bookshop
from what
but there is more to that story Peter
Townsend was on the Oh USA
executive with John and he gave me more
details about that negotiation
apparently John explained to wickles
that unless they agreed to sell half of
their campus store - Oh USA the students
would set up their own bookshop in
competition after consideration wit cos
agreed and John then told them that Oh
USA had no money but they would pay back
for purchase out of their share of the
future profits astoundingly which is
testament to John's powers of persuasion
they agreed and Peter believes that this
loan was repaid within four or five
years Oh USA within the proud owner of
half the University Bookstore without
ever having paid out a cent most people
recognize the benefits of a university
education but what is special about our
University the University of Otago we
are the only truly national and
residential University in New Zealand
and three-quarters of our students come
from outside Otago Southland and 85
percent from outside of Dunedin whereas
other universities in New Zealand draw
most of their students from their own
surrounding area so how does this
residential experience benefit our
students the government monitors
University performance using educational
performance indicators but compare such
things as an academic as student
academic performance retention and
degree completion Otago has a superb
record usually topping at least three of
the four indicators and in some years
topping all four in addition to being
the top four performer
according to these metrics we lead the
way nationally in successful university
outcomes for Maori and Pacific students
- so academic performance at our
university is outstanding
no question but what are the other
things about Otago that make our
graduates so special and sought after by
employers at Otago
not only come to learn together but to
live together no other New Zealand
University has such a high proportion of
their students living in such close
proximity to the University campus that
does have its issues however there are
obvious benefits to this for the
students falling out of bed at quarter
to nine to make it to a nine o'clock
lecture for example but there are other
benefits from living in amongst your
fellow students and I'm not just talking
about great parties lazy sunny
afternoons on front porch of a flat
although these are important parts of
the memories we all share employers tell
us that at our NGO graduates are great
collaborators great team players
independent thinkers quick adaptors and
confident too these attributes are very
deliberately considered in developing
curriculum content but they are also
developed in our students just in daily
life in residential colleges and
particularly in the transition from
living in colleges to flats our aim is
to develop talented graduates and give
them the best possible springboard into
the future those talents are not just
academic we want to grow great people
too we want our students to learn how to
critically question ideas and not to
just to blindly accept everything the
media or the Internet serves up to us
working together on group assignments
and equally importantly navigating those
flatting years gives our students the
skills to be great team players and
excellent collaborators but sometimes
things go wrong and we can perform risk
assessments and develop mitigation plans
to try to prevent bad outcomes but the
factors things will go wrong and the
skill the key skill we all need to learn
is how to deal with things that go wrong
in our lives along with all the happy
proud and exciting times you have spent
at Otago
things will have happened that hurt you
that made you angry embarrassed or sad
the most important thing that you will
have learned here at Otago is that
people are what matter in the end the
ones who laughed with you and cried with
you the ones that reached out a hand and
helped you to your feet when you fell
the ones who applauded your successes
and supported you when you felt
uncertain and wondered whether you were
heading in the right direction and
making the best choices you will have
made lifelong friends in the last few
years who will stay with you throughout
your life enjoy those friendships and
nurture them remember always that great
things can only be achieved by and with
great people aspire to make a difference
and the lives of those you'll lead
throughout your career just as all those
years ago John inspired me now go and
have a fantastic night out with all your
friends and far no nor Dadar
