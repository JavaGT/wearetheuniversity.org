orator to present a candidate for an

festival is a celebration of living with
the community and the arts
intertwine this is a commitment
encouraged by her husband Greg Fletcher
who we welcome here today
Karlis roots family roots like those of
Arts Festival's Lyon Holland M stirred M
along with the cities of Edinburgh and
Avignon invested scarce funds in 1947 to
invite international artists to create
festivals to envision envision how to
build the future after the devastation
of war art then as now was essential to
reimagine the world Carla the eldest of
three sisters grew up until ringing West
Auckland with her parents settled coming
via Indonesia movement dance for her
mother and music chairs for her father
were part of that busy household unsure
of what she might do Carla lift home for
the adventure of student life in Dunedin
she enrolled in the contemporary dance
program and physical education which
reflected the wider interests of
innovative director Philips models there
her first dance teacher was the
inspirational Galen Asha Paresh Russia
taught Calaway otta and haka Carlo
relished the opportunity to perform in
the annual kept in concert though she
was cautioned not to sing but her
dancing was most welcome
travelled followed University learning
about life and places as diverse as
Burma and Barcelona eventually Karla
returned to study completing an MA and
dance and arts administration at George
Washington University in the United
States back in New Zealand Karla
freelanced in all areas of contemporary
dance from reviewing to producing
performing choreographing and marketing
she worked as a stage manager lighting
rigger dance teacher high school teacher
arts marketer and tour manager Karla
danced at the flying Kiwi Fringe
Festival in 1986 and swept stages at the
International Festival in 1988 her
portfolio of work turned out to be the
perfect preparation for Festival
management a role she accidentally
acquired when a friend who worked at the
Wellington based New Zealand biennial
International Festival of the Arts
required emergency surgery after filling
in for her friend the director asked
Karla to stay and in 1996 she became the
executive director of the festival and
then artistic director from 2000 to 2006
she then took up directorship of the
Auckland Arts Festival overseeing it
becoming an annual event in 2015 and
leading it until 2017 a festival
director needs to have a vision of how a
festival will fit with the community an
excitement about introducing new work
and a willingness to take risks the job
became Carla's passion pulling people
together from the diverse areas to make
something special this might be
exemplified by her perception that Rena
Liang's play the bone feeder would make
a great opera the play about the 1902
hokianga sinking of the
vintner taking the bones of chinese
miners back to china incorporated Asian
and Maori stories Karla convinced Rene
to write the libretto and Gareth far the
score to come up with a spellbinding
opera described as a thought-provoking
deliberation on history culture and the
nature of belonging unafraid to
Commission new works that ask important
questions
Carla believes the arts have the power
to enhance understanding of others
without littering at people some of
Carla's personal highlights have
included the commissioning producing and
championing of seminal works by Mari
Pacific and Asian artists and mentoring
other artistic directors recently she
took great delight in developing the fan
nuit project a bottom-up initiative
diverse communities in Auckland were
asked what they would like to achieve
and then professional artists were
chosen to join with the community to
work alongside them on a project
Carla's focus has always been
international she has sought ways to
connect with New Zealand artists living
offshore to find ways for them to return
and continue to be informed by and
influence the local sing she has been a
supportive enabler of artistic risk and
international collaboration she has a
talent to connect people and events when
she sees an opportunity Carla was
instrumental in bringing the Edinburgh
Military Tattoo to New Zealand for its
first ever appearance outside of
Scotland amongst other acts she invited
rhinoceros and loved from China and the
chorus oedipus from Korea art has the
power to advance deepen and potentially
transform communities through her
passion for bringing art to all New
Zealanders Carla van zijn has assisted
both communities and individuals

I live in AutoKey and my name is Carla
vans on good afternoon and greetings to
the Chancellor Vice Chancellor registrar
Pro Chancellor members of council
professors Broughton and Brookes
University staff and most importantly to
the graduates and your father and
friends who are here to celebrate with
you on this very special occasion I'm
honored to have been given the
opportunity to be here however I think
giving this speech is one of the
scariest things I've ever had to do it
feels a bit like going to the dentist
you just want it to be over for me life
is a journey not a in a linear sense but
as a series of experiences and I hope
that I've grabbed hold of each new
opportunity and embraced it almost 50
years ago I started at Otago University
I look back over those 50 years and feel
lucky that I've had some extraordinary
times challenges and fun alongside some
hard work sadness and a few bad times I
often wonder how that wild brash
unspoken outspoken young person who
attack who attended Otago could turn out
to be me now I'm still outspoken but
while I'm not 9 p.m. is the new midnight
how do those fifty years go so fast I'm
not entirely sure why I came to our NGO
perhaps because it was the only place I
could study dance because it was a
university away from home that was a
great thing and I don't think I chose a
no way I chose PE I think was because I
couldn't really make up my mind what I
wanted to do I don't think it matters
when you're 21 if you don't know what
you want to do many things in my life
have impacted on Who I am today and what
I've been able to do just a few weeks
ago my dad died
and I realized how important parents and
family are in making me who I am when
one is suddenly the eldest in the family
you feel slightly untethered and you
have to think what is important my
parents were immigrants who came to this
country with nothing English was not my
first language as an immigrant child of
parents who loved this country I was
lucky because as outsiders they embraced
everybody and everything I grew up being
different from many of my friends we ate
rice and chilies in the 50s not many
people grew chilies then my parents
gifted me with values and beliefs that I
live by today they inspired me not to be
scared of being different and to go into
situations where I was the other like
being the only female or the only
Pacquiao in the room they were open to
all people and cultures and then stilled
in me a love of the Arts it's important
to be yourself and to be true to your
values and your beliefs as young New
Zealand poets Stella Pritchard
aka Stella said there are many other
voices out there but no voice is like
yours for the first ten years after
attending Otago I had no idea what I
wanted to do of no fixed abode I
adventured around the world from USA to
have
understand to Iran and India and to
Europe I think travels in my blood as
kids we'd Kempton out-of-the-way places
all around this country and when I was
16 I headed to Europe for the first time
on my own I was curious about everything
it really helped me in my future work
and life be curious be open to people
and experiences take slow steps take
time to enjoy all those different
journeys and pathways that you will come
across in your life after doing a
master's degree in the States
I returned to alter all at first I
thought I'd be a performer but I soon
discovered I couldn't earn a living so
to survived I worked in any of the area
of the arts that I could as a technician
a stage manager a ticket seller and
usher and a publicist eventually I
decided I had to be proactive and make
things happen for myself so I started
producing shows I brought people
together I did grants I employed people
to create to perform and to design this
was the first step in a journey to a
career that I loved I had found that I
wanted to make things happen for great
artists in fact it turned out I was much
better at producing other people's shows
than I ever was at being an artist
myself I started working in the festival
business in 1989 when I was 37 years old
taking over for three weeks from a
friend who had to have an operation when
I agreed to do the publicist job in
Wellington I never knew that my life
would change so much those three weeks
were a revelation I'd found my passion
with the support of great members
mentors my family my husband and some
luck throwin along the way I ended up as
an arts festival director such are the
chances of fate in life I'd found a job
that I loved and a life that was
meaningful to me and I think that's what
we all hope for my parents values my
love of travel my belief that everybody
deserves to have a great arts experience
and that everyone's story
should be heard drove me in my festival
career I thought I could change the
world little by little throughout
because culture is a framework by which
we work and live
artists political it creates
conversations it is a way to see
different perspectives and to learn to
respect each other over the last thirty
years through the arts and my work I
grew to recognize further what was
important to me I discovered that most
of the world and the stories that we are
told come from a white Western male
point of view in fact the whole context
of our life is skewed that way even in
the arts where we are supposedly liberal
I sometimes think that things have
changed and then other times I don't
really think they've changed at all over
my lifetime I had to proactively seek to
Commission and present work by Marty
Pacific and Asian artists and by women
Ahmadi or a woman still has to fight to
prove themselves over and over again to
get the job the Commission the
exhibition or the gig sexism and racism
are alive and well and Altair or as we
see daily in our media and experience in
our work in our lives we need to look
honestly at our country and to stand up
and say what we believe in it may be
difficult but it has to happen I believe
we need to fight for equality everywhere
and constantly including in boardrooms
one woman on the New Zealand Stock
Exchange out of a hundred companies in
the media in law firms in our labs in
our theatres and music venues and in our
daily lives it's not enough to have
diversity or be inclusive we need more
women more Marty more diverse people to
be in charge to decide on how we do
things the balance of power has to shift
a couple of years ago I was diagnosed
with renal failure
I was lucky a friend gave me one of her
kidneys just before the transplant they
told me I would be dead before Christmas
my twice daily medication alarm bell
reminds me that I have to live
each day as if it were my last we need
to be joyful and enjoy life we meet to
spend time with family and friends we
need to be kind to each other and we
need to ensure that when we leave this
life we are happy with what we have done
I love being a mentor to those who are
following I love that some of the people
that I have worked with over the years
and now the new leaders the new festival
directors but new creators of the world
currently I'm on the board that is
trying to bring science and the arts
together to spread the word about
climate change
last week we held a two-day workshop
with artists and scientists from around
the country amazing information and
ideas were shared one of the scientists
shocked me when he said growth is the
antithesis of working towards a carbon 0
world it caused me to think about the
framework of change needed in our world
with Arts and Sciences working together
on one common goal we can bring about
change
so while sometimes they look at the
media and get discouraged and now I'm
not sure that I can change the world
anymore I still think that through arts
culture and science we can give
alternative views because we can't
continue the way we are going right now
our whole system needs to change we have
to believe that together and each in our
own way we can make a difference and
that we can bring about change I think
that you are the change have courage be
disruptive be rebellious research create
innovate and transform use your talent
and your skill use your own voice to
speak out it is your time kia kaha
