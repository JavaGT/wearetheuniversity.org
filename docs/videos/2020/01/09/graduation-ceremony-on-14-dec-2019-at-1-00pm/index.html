for<br>an honorary degree Bill Robertson grew<br>up on a sheep farm in the Huayra Valley<br>near Blenheim he attended a series of<br>country schools the first of which had<br>just nine pupils he was he says not as<br>good at paying attention as he might<br>have been he did a year of high school<br>by correspondence which didn't work out<br>so well and eventually left to attendant<br>beads College as a boarder as the end of<br>school wound bill was still unsure about<br>his future career he considered the Navy<br>and civil engineering but the problem<br>was solved by a chance encounter with a<br>lands and survey officer who asked that<br>most fundamental question what do you<br>like build really liked being outdoors<br>in the wild<br>traveling hunting fishing what was he<br>good at well he had a head for numbers<br>he was good at trigonometry it was<br>settled bill began his working life in<br>1954 as a drafting cadet with the lands<br>and survey Department as bill tells it<br>he wasn't really neat enough for<br>drafting fortunately he was soon<br>appointed a survey cadet so began the<br>long and illustrious career of one of<br>New Zealand's great public servants who<br>would eventually become surveyor-general<br>and director general of the department<br>of survey and land information bills<br>work would help to make fundamental<br>changes to many aspects of New Zealand<br>life that most of us take for granted<br>planning a trip exploring a national<br>park<br>buying a house voting surveying would<br>take bill deep into the our taro and New<br>Zealand backcountry South to Antarctica<br>north to Malaysia and across the globe<br>as a land administration expert working<br>for NZ aid the World Bank the UN Food<br>and Agriculture Organization and to the<br>Middle East and Africa where he helped<br>determine the borders of disputed the<br>locations of disputed international<br>borders including the Iraq Kuwait border<br>after the Gulf War the work was<br>challenging physically personally and<br>sometimes politically Bill's early<br>career was full of travel which he loved<br>but eventually moving from house to<br>house 13 of them in all became too<br>difficult bill took a job at head office<br>in Wellington where he finally settled<br>down with his wife Judy and their<br>growing family<br>mark-paul Peter and Hamish we welcome<br>Judy Mark and Bill's sister Kay here to<br>celebrate with us today<br>bill adapted to his new life and head<br>office and it soon became clear that as<br>well as an excellent surveyor he was<br>also an exceptional leader colleagues<br>described bill as judging his own<br>success by how well he helped others to<br>succeed bill they say was always<br>forward-looking particularly interested<br>in how new technology might change the<br>department what were the opportunities<br>what would staff have to learn how could<br>bill was also alert to social change he<br>recognized early the significance of<br>biculturalism in the public service he<br>actively encouraged the recognition of T<br>Conger and promoted the importance of<br>Tyrael and was determined that the<br>department would become a trusted source<br>of information for Marty in the<br>resolution of land claims a surveyor<br>general and dejected and director<br>general of the department of survey and<br>land information from 1987 to 1996 bill<br>chaired the New Zealand Geographic board<br>and he was part of an effort to ensure<br>that our place names reflect the full<br>sweep of our country's history he also<br>chaired the Electoral Commission<br>instituting processes that strengthened<br>New Zealand's enviable tradition of<br>neutrality in the drawing of electoral<br>boundaries throughout his career bill<br>has been a consistent supporter of the<br>University of Otago and its National<br>School of surveying he worked closely<br>with Professor basil Jones to establish<br>three BSC degrees which he then<br>supported by moving technical staff to<br>Dunedin so that they could enroll as<br>full-time students this upskilling<br>produced a generation of men and women<br>who formed the backbone for many of the<br>digital mapping innovations subsequently<br>undertaken by the department what was<br>his most important achievement there are<br>many to choose from but bill<br>well remembers the day he was told by<br>then Finance Minister Roger Douglas that<br>the department could no longer be<br>primarily funded by tax payers it would<br>have to earn its way through charging<br>for services and its budget would be cut<br>by 50% which turned out to be 70% there<br>was a real chance that the department<br>would be broken up and it's proud record<br>of an innovation lost scattering it's<br>bright young staff whom bill had done so<br>much to develop but Bill believes that<br>challenges are opportunities what<br>matters is how you adapt bills<br>colleagues describe him as always<br>seeming to be one step ahead always<br>having a clear vision of the way forward<br>under his leadership the department<br>survived and adapted to become a world<br>leader amongst such organisations and<br>that was possible because bill is<br>essentially an optimist who believes in<br>the people with whom he works and<br>believes in the power of innovation<br>above all bill Robertson is driven by a<br>fundamental ethic of service to our Tara<br>and its people<br>Chancellor I have the honor to present<br>for graduation in the degree of Doctor<br>of Science honoris causa

Bachelor of surveying degree I<br>also pondered what I was thinking that I<br>was in your position sitting in this<br>beautiful building listening to a<br>similar address 18 or 19 years is a<br>fairly long time for me of you that's<br>almost a lifetime and considering I can<br>barely recall what happened last week I<br>had little confidence that I remember<br>too much and to be honest I even forgot<br>what year I graduated when I gave my<br>biography embarrassing I do recall<br>though feeling a bit overwhelmed does it<br>suddenly dawned on me that a major<br>chapter of my life was ending and I was<br>stepping out into the real world no<br>longer would life be handed to me on a<br>plate with others telling me what was<br>required and win now that I had letters<br>after my name it was reasonable for<br>others to expect that I knew something<br>useful the pressure anyone else feeling<br>that today I'm incredibly grateful to<br>say that since then I've had a great<br>time when I was invited to give this<br>address which is a huge honor<br>thank you again vice-chancellor I have<br>to admit when I got the phone call<br>my first thought was was I in trouble<br>and my second thought was why me<br>anyway I was informed one of the<br>objectives could be to leave one message<br>that graduates will remember for the<br>rest of their lives it's no mean feat<br>and I hope you'll have better memories<br>than I do I'm gonna start by asking you<br>to imagine yourselves<br>doing a similar address and around 20<br>years time how will the world our<br>country your community your profession<br>have changed socially politically<br>environmentally and economically what<br>will you have done to improve it what's<br>important to you<br>today I'm going to talk about taking<br>opportunities expecting change and being<br>human when I think back to the work<br>environment I stepped into as a fresh<br>graduate at the end of 2001 a lot has<br>changed in a relatively short amount of<br>time back then we drew legal survey<br>plans on a1 sheets of paper with<br>drafting pins we recorded our precise<br>distance and angle measurements in a<br>field notebook with pencil and only if<br>there were hundreds of measurements that<br>we use an electronic data recorder<br>formal communication to clients and<br>external organizations was via fax or<br>word process letters emails were use but<br>not extensively and everything was<br>printed off and hardcopy for filing and<br>I can distinctly recall being nervous<br>about phone calls because that meant I<br>had to think on my feet and I was<br>worried my work colleagues but listen to<br>what I was saying and view me is<br>incompetent this was in the days of<br>landlines Mobile's weren't commonly used<br>for business and this we were working in<br>a different part of the country so you<br>couldn't just stand up and wander off<br>into a quieter part of the office the<br>privacy fast water today we have<br>open-plan offices with hot discs<br>collaboration spaces quiet pods and mini<br>computer systems of cloud-based and<br>accessible from any mobile device half a<br>time you don't even need to be<br>physically in an office I realize you've<br>probably heard many similar stories from<br>members of your own family and your<br>lecturers and tutors here at University<br>the reason I'm mentioning it is that<br>with the current rate of technological<br>change the workplaces and work culture<br>that many of you will step into will be<br>vastly different to what others before<br>you have experienced for some of you the<br>environment will be more bet<br>than you expect I've just spent the last<br>two two-and-a-half years leading digital<br>transformation in New Zealand at the at<br>a sane engineering consultancy firm I<br>joined as a graduate survey I've known<br>so much during this time mostly about<br>human nature and how to be a bit of<br>person myself I've definitely been<br>operating outside my comfort zone but<br>it's also allowed me to improve my<br>communication skills and try to see<br>things from other people's perspectives<br>there are two points I want to make in<br>relation to this experience one all<br>industries are being digitized it's very<br>likely that the organisation you go into<br>may look to you for your ideas on<br>technology in culture because you are<br>digital natives who knows what the<br>workplace of 2039 will look like it's<br>likely that change will be a constant<br>for you and even more than it is for<br>today's workers today so I'd recommend<br>you strap yourselves in for the ride and<br>try to get comfortable with being<br>uncomfortable don't be afraid to change<br>tack if an opportunity arises to do<br>something different that interest you<br>it's point to you'll undoubtedly learn<br>new skills and meet different people<br>around about the same time that I took<br>up the digital role I was elected as<br>president of survey in special New<br>Zealand which is a voluntary role in a<br>professional membership organisation<br>I've just completed that two-year term<br>the thing I like most about being part<br>of a professional body is the<br>realization that you are part of<br>something bigger than yourself<br>I found that I've got out just as much<br>as I put in by being part of survey and<br>special New Zealand I got the<br>opportunity to meet amazing dedicated<br>people like Bill here from all parts of<br>New Zealand as well as all over the<br>world some of these people who become<br>really good friends and many of them<br>have supported me in a mentoring<br>capacity over the years and in a number<br>of those people are here today so it's<br>wonderful to see you all I'd highly<br>recommend you consider you're getting in<br>getting yourself involved in the<br>professional girl group yourself when<br>you start working many have young<br>professional divisions and these provide<br>a lot of support as you never get your<br>way through your career if I'm honest I<br>have to say it was full<br>for both me and my family having two<br>leadership roles concurrently and I<br>possibly wouldn't recommend it having<br>said that I recently changed roles again<br>back to my core area of expertise<br>leading surveying civil engineering of<br>geospatial globally for Oregon without<br>having challenged myself to dive into<br>the two roles I doubt I would have<br>developed the skills and confidence to<br>go for my current role and I probably<br>wouldn't be standing here before you<br>today you would have heard that<br>old it as the best things in life don't<br>come for free the true truth is they<br>often require a lot of elbow grease and<br>perseverance there will be times when<br>everything does not go to plan one of<br>the hardest lessons I learnt at work was<br>that when I was faced with a problem<br>that I felt I had to tackle by myself<br>remember when I sit at the start of this<br>address that I start I feel like I<br>should know a lot when I graduated as a<br>qualified professional it's hard not to<br>have a high expectations of yourself and<br>to find the balance between taking<br>ownership in asking colleagues for help<br>in order to solve a problem I once made<br>a mistake of not flagging an issue early<br>it might have been the toughest listen<br>ever but it was a valuable one I learned<br>more from that one bad project than ten<br>good ones the point is we're all human<br>and we all make mistakes when the<br>inevitable happens to you try not to<br>beat yourself up too much learn from it<br>and share your lessons with others<br>speaking about being human no doubt you<br>will be aware that many jobs across all<br>sectors are becoming increasingly<br>automated and some of you may be<br>concerned about this but I don't think<br>you should be there will always be a<br>need for humans to collaborate to<br>provide value through building<br>relationships in communicating with<br>others to ensure the right problems are<br>being solved as the world's big<br>challenges such as poverty and climate<br>change are becoming more complex and<br>interrelated the ability to collaborate<br>with others to pull knowledge and solve<br>them collectively becomes essential<br>these days no one individual profession<br>organization can hope to have all the<br>information needed to fit all the jigsaw<br>puzzle pieces together my advice here is<br>to always bear in mind that other<br>people's experiences and opinions<br>matters as much and can be as helpful as<br>your own so learn to engage your brain<br>before your mouth yes your contribution<br>matters but you are just one cog in the<br>machine both of the roles I've recently<br>been and have certainly reinforced it to<br>me<br>finally can I remind you to be grateful<br>for the fact you're graduating today<br>grateful that you've had the support of<br>your family the University of Otago and<br>the Dunedin community grateful for the<br>people who are sitting beside you today<br>your friends and classmates the world's<br>a small place and you'll find them

for those of you who<br>have already secured employment be<br>grateful for your employers never stop<br>being grateful especially for the<br>seemingly simple things in life that we<br>take for granted<br>clean air sunshine beautiful scenery<br>health family and friends there will<br>come a time in your life if you haven't<br>been there already when you realize it's<br>not the material things that matter at<br>the end of the day you've come to<br>university to build a foundation of<br>technical knowledge you've met all sorts<br>of interesting people and you've broaden<br>your horizons along the way now it's<br>your duty to use that knowledge in those<br>experiences to help make the world a<br>better place not everyone has the<br>privilege of attending University so<br>make sure you make the most of it and<br>finally don't forget to have fun I wish<br>you all the very best for your future<br>now go forth and be the change you want<br>to see<br>thank you very much Rebecca
