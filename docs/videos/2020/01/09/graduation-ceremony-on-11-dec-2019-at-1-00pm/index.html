Fletcher<br>who we welcome here today<br>Karlis roots family roots like those of<br>Arts Festival's Lyon Holland M stirred M<br>along with the cities of Edinburgh and<br>Avignon invested scarce funds in 1947 to<br>invite international artists to create<br>festivals to envision envision how to<br>build the future after the devastation<br>of war art then as now was essential to<br>reimagine the world Carla the eldest of<br>three sisters grew up until ringing West<br>Auckland with her parents settled coming<br>via Indonesia movement dance for her<br>mother and music chairs for her father<br>were part of that busy household unsure<br>of what she might do Carla lift home for<br>the adventure of student life in Dunedin<br>she enrolled in the contemporary dance<br>program and physical education which<br>reflected the wider interests of<br>innovative director Philips models there<br>her first dance teacher was the<br>inspirational Galen Asha Paresh Russia<br>taught Calaway otta and haka Carlo<br>relished the opportunity to perform in<br>the annual kept in concert though she<br>was cautioned not to sing but her<br>dancing was most welcome<br>travelled followed University learning<br>about life and places as diverse as<br>Burma and Barcelona eventually Karla<br>returned to study completing an MA and<br>dance and arts administration at George<br>Washington University in the United<br>States back in New Zealand Karla<br>freelanced in all areas of contemporary<br>dance from reviewing to producing<br>performing choreographing and marketing<br>she worked as a stage manager lighting<br>rigger dance teacher high school teacher<br>arts marketer and tour manager Karla<br>danced at the flying Kiwi Fringe<br>Festival in 1986 and swept stages at the<br>International Festival in 1988 her<br>portfolio of work turned out to be the<br>perfect preparation for Festival<br>management a role she accidentally<br>acquired when a friend who worked at the<br>Wellington based New Zealand biennial<br>International Festival of the Arts<br>required emergency surgery after filling<br>in for her friend the director asked<br>Karla to stay and in 1996 she became the<br>executive director of the festival and<br>then artistic director from 2000 to 2006<br>she then took up directorship of the<br>Auckland Arts Festival overseeing it<br>becoming an annual event in 2015 and<br>leading it until 2017 a festival<br>director needs to have a vision of how a<br>festival will fit with the community an<br>excitement about introducing new work<br>and a willingness to take risks the job<br>became Carla's passion pulling people<br>together from the diverse areas to make<br>something special this might be<br>exemplified by her perception that Rena<br>Liang's play the bone feeder would make<br>a great opera the play about the 1902<br>hokianga sinking of the<br>vintner taking the bones of chinese<br>miners back to china incorporated Asian<br>and Maori stories Karla convinced Rene<br>to write the libretto and Gareth far the<br>score to come up with a spellbinding<br>opera described as a thought-provoking<br>deliberation on history culture and the<br>nature of belonging unafraid to<br>Commission new works that ask important<br>questions<br>Carla believes the arts have the power<br>to enhance understanding of others<br>without littering at people some of<br>Carla's personal highlights have<br>included the commissioning producing and<br>championing of seminal works by Mari<br>Pacific and Asian artists and mentoring<br>other artistic directors recently she<br>took great delight in developing the fan<br>nuit project a bottom-up initiative<br>diverse communities in Auckland were<br>asked what they would like to achieve<br>and then professional artists were<br>chosen to join with the community to<br>work alongside them on a project<br>Carla's focus has always been<br>international she has sought ways to<br>connect with New Zealand artists living<br>offshore to find ways for them to return<br>and continue to be informed by and<br>influence the local sing she has been a<br>supportive enabler of artistic risk and<br>international collaboration she has a<br>talent to connect people and events when<br>she sees an opportunity Carla was<br>instrumental in bringing the Edinburgh<br>Military Tattoo to New Zealand for its<br>first ever appearance outside of<br>Scotland amongst other acts she invited<br>rhinoceros and loved from China and the<br>chorus oedipus from Korea art has the<br>power to advance

afternoon and greetings to<br>the Chancellor Vice Chancellor registrar<br>Pro Chancellor members of council<br>professors Broughton and Brookes<br>University staff and most importantly to<br>the graduates and your father and<br>friends who are here to celebrate with<br>you on this very special occasion I'm<br>honored to have been given the<br>opportunity to be here however I think<br>giving this speech is one of the<br>scariest things I've ever had to do it<br>feels a bit like going to the dentist<br>you just want it to be over for me life<br>is a journey not a in a linear sense but<br>as a series of experiences and I hope<br>that I've grabbed hold of each new<br>opportunity and embraced it almost 50<br>years ago I started at Otago University<br>I look back over those 50 years and feel<br>lucky that I've had some extraordinary<br>times challenges and fun alongside some<br>hard work sadness and a few bad times I<br>often wonder how that wild brash<br>unspoken outspoken young person who<br>attack who attended Otago could turn out<br>to be me now I'm still outspoken but<br>while I'm not 9 p.m. is the new midnight<br>how do those fifty years go so fast I'm<br>not entirely sure why I came to our NGO<br>perhaps because it was the only place I<br>could study dance because it was a<br>university away from home that was a<br>great thing and I don't think I chose a<br>no way I chose PE I think was because I<br>couldn't really make up my mind what I<br>wanted to do I don't think it matters<br>when you're 21 if you don't know what<br>you want to do many things in my life<br>have impacted on Who I am today and what<br>I've been able to do just a few weeks<br>ago my dad died<br>and I realized how important parents and<br>family are in making me who I am when<br>one is suddenly the eldest in the family<br>you feel slightly untethered and you<br>have to think what is important my<br>parents were immigrants who came to this<br>country with nothing English was not my<br>first language as an immigrant child of<br>parents who loved this country I was<br>lucky because as outsiders they embraced<br>everybody and everything I grew up being<br>different from many of my friends we ate<br>rice and chilies in the 50s not many<br>people grew chilies then my parents<br>gifted me with values and beliefs that I<br>live by today they inspired me not to be<br>scared of being different and to go into<br>situations where I was the other like<br>being the only female or the only<br>Pacquiao in the room they were open to<br>all people and cultures and then stilled<br>in me a love of the Arts it's important<br>to be yourself and to be true to your<br>values and your beliefs as young New<br>Zealand poets Stella Pritchard<br>aka Stella said there are many other<br>voices out there but no voice is like<br>yours for the first ten years after<br>attending Otago I had no idea what I<br>wanted to do of no fixed abode I<br>adventured around the world from USA to<br>have<br>understand to Iran and India and to<br>Europe I think travels in my blood as<br>kids we'd Kempton out-of-the-way places<br>all around this country and when I was<br>16 I headed to Europe for the first time<br>on my own I was curious about everything<br>it really helped me in my future work<br>and life be curious be open to people<br>and experiences take slow steps take<br>time to enjoy all those different<br>journeys and pathways that you will come<br>across in your life after doing a<br>master's degree in the States<br>I returned to alter all at first I<br>thought I'd be a performer but I soon<br>discovered I couldn't earn a living so<br>to survived I worked in any of the area<br>of the arts that I could as a technician<br>a stage manager a ticket seller and<br>usher and a publicist eventually I<br>decided I had to be proactive and make<br>things happen for myself so I started<br>producing shows I brought people<br>together I did grants I employed people<br>to create to perform and to design this<br>was the first step in a journey to a<br>career that I loved I had found that I<br>wanted to make things happen for great<br>artists in fact it turned out I was much<br>better at producing other people's shows<br>than I ever was at being an artist<br>myself I started working in the festival<br>business in 1989 when I was 37 years old<br>taking over for three weeks from a<br>friend who had to have an operation when<br>I agreed to do the publicist job in<br>Wellington I never knew that my life<br>would change so much those three weeks<br>were a revelation I'd found my passion<br>with the support of great members<br>mentors my family my husband and some<br>luck throwin along the way I ended up as<br>an arts festival director such are the<br>chances of fate in life I'd found a job<br>that I loved and a life that was<br>meaningful to me and I think that's what<br>we all hope for my parents values my<br>love of travel my belief that everybody<br>deserves to have a great arts experience<br>and that everyone's story<br>should be heard drove me in my festival<br>career I thought I could change the<br>world little by little throughout<br>because culture is a framework by which<br>we work and live<br>artists political it creates<br>conversations it is a way to see<br>different perspectives and to learn to<br>respect each other over the last thirty<br>years through the arts and my work I<br>grew to recognize further what was<br>important to me I discovered that most<br>of the world and the stories that we are<br>told come from a white Western male<br>point of view in fact the whole context<br>of our life is skewed that way even in<br>the arts where we are supposedly liberal<br>I sometimes think that things have<br>changed and then other times I don't<br>really think they've changed at all over<br>my lifetime I had to proactively seek to<br>Commission and present work by Marty<br>Pacific and Asian artists and by women<br>Ahmadi or a woman still has to fight to<br>prove themselves over and over again to<br>get the job the Commission the<br>exhibition or the gig sexism and racism<br>are alive and well and Altair or as we<br>see daily in our media and experience in<br>our work in our lives we need to look<br>honestly at our country and to stand up<br>and say what we believe in it may be<br>difficult but it has to happen I believe<br>we need to fight for equality everywhere<br>and constantly including in boardrooms<br>one woman on the New Zealand Stock<br>Exchange out of a hundred companies in<br>the media in law firms in our labs in<br>our theatres and music venues and in our<br>daily lives it's not enough to have<br>diversity or be inclusive we need more<br>women more Marty more diverse people to<br>be in charge to decide on how we do<br>things the balance of power has to shift<br>a couple of years ago I was diagnosed<br>with renal failure<br>I was lucky a friend gave me one of her<br>kidneys just before the transplant they<br>told me I would be dead before Christmas<br>my twice daily medication alarm bell<br>reminds me that I have to live<br>each day as if it were my last we need<br>to be joyful and enjoy life we meet to<br>spend time with family and friends we<br>need to be kind to each other and we<br>need to ensure that when we leave this<br>life we are happy with what we have done<br>I love being a mentor to those who are<br>following I love that some of the people<br>that I have worked with over the years<br>and now the new leaders the new festival<br>directors but new creators of the world<br>currently I'm on the board that is<br>trying to bring science and the arts<br>together to spread the word about<br>climate change<br>last week we held a two-day workshop<br>with artists and scientists from around<br>the country amazing information and<br>ideas were shared one of the scientists<br>shocked me when he said growth is the<br>antithesis of working towards a carbon 0<br>world it caused me to think about the<br>framework of change needed in our world<br>with Arts and Sciences working together<br>on one common goal we can bring about<br>change<br>so while sometimes they look at the<br>media and get discouraged and now I'm<br>not sure that I can change the world<br>anymore I still think that through arts<br>culture and science we can give<br>alternative views because we can't<br>continue the way we are going right now<br>our whole system needs to change we have<br>to believe that together and each in our<br>own way we can make a difference and<br>that we can bring about change I think<br>that you are the change have courage be<br>disruptive be rebellious research
