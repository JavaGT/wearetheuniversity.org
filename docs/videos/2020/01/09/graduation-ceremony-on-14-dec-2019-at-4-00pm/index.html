because it's<br>the right thing to do these were John<br>judges words to students and staff in<br>2016 when he was the inaugural executive<br>in residence at the University of Otago<br>School of Business on that visit yet<br>returned to his roots in Dunedin<br>enchanting our students with a range of<br>compelling insights drawn from a long<br>and hugely successful career here was a<br>boy from Dunedin with the be common<br>accounting who had risen to become the<br>chief executive of Ernst and Young one<br>of the four titans of Financial Services<br>in New Zealand and chair of A&amp;Z Bank<br>which became under his tenure the<br>largest bank in New Zealand what our<br>staff and students recognized was that<br>here was a true leader with a broad and<br>sharp intellect a humane outlook on<br>business and life you'd also a down to<br>earth an approachable manner and most<br>importantly a sponge supporter of this<br>university in this city John grew up in<br>Northeast Valley and early in his final<br>year at OU Targo boys high school<br>wandered down the hill to ask if he<br>could jump ahead a year in enroll late<br>at the University of Otago initially<br>studying maths John's intellectual<br>talent was recognized with an invitation<br>to join the honors stream but as he put<br>it he wanted to study something more<br>related to the real world and switched<br>to accounting his roving intellect and<br>evident ability saw him become involved<br>in a great number of actions that have<br>helped shape this university he was<br>elected onto the executive of ou USA and<br>became the student rep to the University<br>Council<br>he helped secure the loan that purchased<br>what became the clubs and societies<br>building on Albany Street along with<br>negotiating the purchase of the old<br>would cool store to become the unit<br>a bookshop his efforts as a student<br>leader shaped the campus that we wander<br>through today it was clear when he<br>graduated that he was destined to be a<br>leader in his field when I asked him to<br>reflect on his time as a student John<br>said the following why did I toggle I<br>learned much from being exposed to ideas<br>which challenged and threatened what I<br>believed in accepting others rights to<br>express ideas which I found confronting<br>and by learning to debate them and think<br>them through has helped me immensely for<br>all of my life to date joining Ernst &amp;<br>Young is a junior accountant in 1974 his<br>interest in the wider world took him to<br>the company's offices in London this was<br>an exciting time to be working in<br>financial services john was fully awake<br>to the potential of the more integrated<br>global economy that was beginning to<br>emerge having been on hand for the<br>genesis moments of the emergence of<br>london as a global financial hub john<br>then returned home to New Zealand in<br>1983 again showing that instinct for<br>arriving somewhere just as big changes<br>were about to take place he was quickly<br>made partner in Ernst &amp; Young thrived in<br>the burgeoning world of financial<br>services in New Zealand in the 1980s and<br>was appointed chief executive in 1995<br>retiring from their position in 2007<br>from the ajaan has served in leadership<br>roles in a range of prominent commercial<br>organizations including the accident<br>compensation corporation fletcher<br>building and gloucester insurance he<br>considers that his most important role<br>through that time was as chair of ANZ<br>Bank where he led the successful merger<br>of ANZ at a national to become New<br>Zealand's largest bank in 2012<br>finally is befitting someone who<br>strongly espouses broadness of intellect<br>he has served as a leader of many arts<br>and cultural organisations including the<br>Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa<br>and the Auckland art gallery foundation<br>John has played an important role at OU<br>Tago in recent years serving on the<br>advisory board of the school of business<br>mentoring staff and students and<br>the graduation address in 2012 when<br>discussing his honorary degree with him<br>recently he reflected on his first<br>capping by the University of us I<br>realized that many of the benefits I<br>enjoyed while at o-tar had been provided<br>fought and paid for by those who came<br>before me I decided then that I would<br>contribute in the same way to as many<br>organizations as possible without asking<br>for recompense this honorary doctorate<br>is a far greater reward and more<br>meaningful to me than any other honor<br>that I which I could have received thank<br>you we welcome John back here today<br>delighted and proud that one of our own<br>who achieved so much

Chancellor<br>Pro Chancellor Vice Chancellor members<br>of University Council<br>dr. judge colleagues friends and far No<br>and most importantly to you graduates I<br>have the privilege to be the chief<br>financial officer of this amazing<br>University but 32 years ago I was<br>sitting right where you are now when I<br>graduated from Otago with my Bachelor of<br>Commerce never in my wildest dreams<br>about where my life might lead could I<br>have imagined a future where I would be<br>standing in front of you all and my word<br>there are a lot of you having been given<br>the responsibility to share some<br>thoughts and advice with you on this<br>momentous day in your lives most<br>importantly congratulations to you all<br>on your achievement and a very warm<br>welcome to your family and friends who<br>have come today to join in your<br>celebration being asked to give the<br>graduation address is not an honour to<br>be taken lightly part of the brief<br>speakers received is that we should try<br>to make the address interesting enough<br>to be remembered in the future now<br>that's a tough gig particularly for an<br>accountant as part of my preparation for<br>today I looked up some suggestions for<br>the collective noun for accountants<br>someone offer were a balance of<br>accountants a spreadsheet of accountants<br>and my personal favorite a fudge of<br>accountants<br>and the interests of balance I also<br>looked up some collective nouns for<br>lawyers and can offer up an argument of<br>lawyers a verbosity of barristers and<br>the rather lovely and eloquence of<br>lawyers I was born a bit north of here<br>and Palmerston Easter Targo and spent<br>most of my early years in Dunedin I was<br>born into a fairly typical New Zealand<br>family we weren't well off but for as<br>long as I can remember I was going to<br>university I don't remember ever having<br>that conversation with my mum but I<br>always knew that that was what was going<br>to happen I come from a long line of<br>hard-working successful people but like<br>around a third of you who are graduating<br>today I was the first in my family to<br>attend university even so to you today a<br>university education doesn't seem an<br>unusual ambition for your child but in<br>1969 when I was five which is about as<br>far back as I can remember and must have<br>been about the time when my mum hatched<br>this University plan only 2% of New<br>Zealanders had a university degree while<br>studying I worked for 30 hours a week<br>and in effect studied half time so it<br>took me six years to finish my degree<br>partway through my studies I moved to<br>the new zealand salmon company I was<br>only 22 and really fell on my feet as I<br>was very fortunate to work with some<br>amazing people there our chief executive<br>was Peter Townsend the chairman was Ian<br>ferrant and one of a group of<br>illustrious directors was John judge you<br>have already heard today about John's<br>incredible career but I would like to<br>share some of the things about John and<br>my time at New Zealand salmon company<br>that have been instrumental in shaping<br>my own career new zealand salmon was a<br>high-risk endeavor and we were the first<br>company to move move New Zealand from<br>hunting salmon to farming it in the<br>ocean<br>John had an uncanny ability to operate<br>in this high-risk environment in a safe<br>way he ensured that the company always<br>had equity available to fall back on if<br>needed and boy we needed it we went<br>through a terrible two-year period where<br>we suffered an algal bloom at our fish<br>farm in Stewart Island and lost most of<br>our salmon stock and in the following<br>year our tomato farm in Gisborne fell<br>victim to cyclone bowl blur the company<br>couldn't sustain these levels of loss<br>and when the company was finally wound<br>up in 1992 thanks to John there was<br>still some funds left to make repayment<br>to shareholders New Zealand salmon was a<br>fledgling company when I joined and it<br>had an amazing culture and was led by<br>group of energetic intelligent brave and<br>slightly crazy people<br>it was incredibly egalitarian and we all<br>felt part of a team that was encouraged<br>to be bold and to take calculated and<br>considered risks just give it a go try<br>hard and if it doesn't work out then<br>pick yourself up dust yourself off and<br>think of something else to try we were<br>only a small team of around 10 people at<br>the head office but we've all gone on to<br>have very successful careers which was<br>made possible by the leadership shown by<br>John and his fellow directors thank you<br>John<br>we also had a lot of fun in preparing<br>this address I was reminded of a time<br>when Keith nailin was flying some of the<br>directors to Gisborne after celebrating<br>celebratory night out John had the bad<br>luck to be sitting next to the door<br>which flew open just after takeoff at<br>about 500 feet various commercial<br>flights had to be redirected so the<br>plane could reel and apparently Keith<br>calmly reached across John slammed the<br>door shut and off they went again I'm<br>not so sure how come John was feeling at<br>the time you have heard that John was<br>instrumental in the purchase of the<br>University bookshop<br>from what<br>but there is more to that story Peter<br>Townsend was on the Oh USA<br>executive with John and he gave me more<br>details about that negotiation<br>apparently John explained to wickles<br>that unless they agreed to sell half of<br>their campus store - Oh USA the students<br>would set up their own bookshop in<br>competition after consideration wit cos<br>agreed and John then told them that Oh<br>USA had no money but they would pay back<br>for purchase out of their share of the<br>future profits astoundingly which is<br>testament to John's powers of persuasion<br>they agreed and Peter believes that this<br>loan was repaid within four or five<br>years Oh USA within the proud owner of<br>half the University Bookstore without<br>ever having paid out a cent most people<br>recognize the benefits of a university<br>education but what is special about our<br>University the University of Otago we<br>are the only truly national and<br>residential University in New Zealand<br>and three-quarters of our students come<br>from outside Otago Southland and 85<br>percent from outside of Dunedin whereas<br>other universities in New Zealand draw<br>most of their students from their own<br>surrounding area so how does this<br>residential experience benefit our<br>students the government monitors<br>University performance using educational<br>performance indicators but compare such<br>things as an academic as student<br>academic performance retention and<br>degree completion Otago has a superb<br>record usually topping at least three of<br>the four indicators and in some years<br>topping all four in addition to being<br>the top four performer<br>according to these metrics we lead the<br>way nationally in successful university<br>outcomes for Maori and Pacific students<br>- so academic performance at our<br>university is outstanding<br>no question but what are the other<br>things about Otago that make our<br>graduates so special and sought after by<br>employers at Otago<br>not only come to learn together but to<br>live together no other New Zealand<br>University has such a high proportion of<br>their students living in such close<br>proximity to the University campus that<br>does have its issues however there are<br>obvious benefits to this for the<br>students falling out of bed at quarter<br>to nine to make it to a nine o'clock<br>lecture for example but there are other<br>benefits from living in amongst your<br>fellow students and I'm not just talking<br>about great parties lazy sunny<br>afternoons on front porch of a flat<br>although these are important parts of<br>the memories we all share employers tell<br>us that at our NGO graduates are great<br>collaborators great team players<br>independent thinkers quick adaptors and<br>confident too these attributes are very<br>deliberately considered in developing<br>curriculum content but they are also<br>developed in our students just in daily<br>life in residential colleges and<br>particularly in the transition from<br>living in colleges to flats our aim is<br>to develop talented graduates and give<br>them the best possible springboard into<br>the future those talents are not just<br>academic we want to grow great people<br>too we want our students to learn how to<br>critically question ideas and not to<br>just to blindly accept everything the<br>media or the Internet serves up to us<br>working together on group assignments<br>and equally importantly navigating those<br>flatting years gives our students the<br>skills to be great team players and<br>excellent collaborators but sometimes<br>things go wrong and we can perform risk<br>assessments and develop mitigation plans<br>to try to prevent bad outcomes but the<br>factors things will go wrong and the<br>skill the key skill we all need to learn<br>is how to deal with things that go wrong<br>in our lives along with all the happy<br>proud and exciting times you have spent<br>at Otago<br>things will have happened that hurt you<br>that made you angry embarrassed or sad<br>the most important thing that you will<br>have learned here at Otago is that<br>people are what matter in the end the<br>ones who laughed with you and cried with<br>you the ones that reached out a hand and<br>helped you to your feet when you fell<br>the ones who applauded your successes<br>and supported you when you felt<br>uncertain and wondered whether you were<br>heading in the right direction and<br>making the best choices you will have<br>made lifelong friends in the last few<br>years who will stay with you throughout<br>your life enjoy those friendships and<br>nurture them remember always that great<br>things can only be achieved by and with<br>great people aspire to make a difference<br>and the lives of those you'll lead<br>throughout your career just as all those<br>years ago John inspired me now go and<br>have a fantastic night out with all your<br>friends and far no nor Dadar<br>namaha nuit tena koe tow tena
