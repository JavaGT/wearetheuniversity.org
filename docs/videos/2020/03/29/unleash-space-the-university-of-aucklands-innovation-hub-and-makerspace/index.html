Unleash Space is the University of Auckland’s state-of-the-art innovation hub and maker space. The University of Auckland was named 2020 Entrepreneurial University of the Year at the Asia-Pacific Triple E Entrepreneurship and Engagement Excellence Awards in Higher Education.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;
