or TIA heyy<br>welcome along it's a real pleasure to<br>see such a big group here this evening<br>for a lecture on intensifying strategic<br>competition the new normal for US China<br>relations and what it means for the rest<br>of us and it's great to see a big crowd<br>because it's a particular pleasure for<br>me to welcome back to Wellington a very<br>distinguished visitor and a long-term<br>friend of the Center for Strategic<br>Studies and Victoria University of<br>Wellington professor Bates Gil Bates I<br>think is known to many of you in this<br>room but he is a he is the professor in<br>the Department of Security Studies at<br>Macquarie University in Sydney he is a<br>fellow of Chatham House in London and<br>some of his previous roles including<br>being the chief executive of the United<br>States Studies Centre at the University<br>of Sydney and he was the Charles Freeman<br>chair in the Center for Strategic and<br>International Studies in Washington so<br>Bates is a very long and very<br>distinguished career with many prominent<br>prestigious roles but the one that we<br>here in Victoria are very proud of is<br>that he was our 2016 so Howard<br>Kippenberger visiting professor in<br>strategic studies and he was an<br>absolutely exemplary chair dutifully<br>toured up and down the country sharing<br>insights with us on what was then a you<br>know becoming aware of a change in China<br>so tonight we're delighted to welcome<br>Bates back to Wellington and to help us<br>understand the change and the the<br>dramatic changes that are taking place<br>in us-china relations and what some of<br>those changes mean for Australia New<br>Zealand and the rest of the region<br>ladies and gentlemen please welcome<br>professor Bates Gil<br>good evening thank you very much David I<br>really appreciate that very warm<br>introduction and it's great to see so<br>many person able to take some time out<br>of their busy schedules to talk about<br>one of my favorite subjects and I think<br>it's going to be a subject of increasing<br>I suspect of increasing interest to all<br>of us in the coming years in the<br>trajectory for us-china relations let me<br>begin by thanking very much David his<br>whole team at the Center for Strategic<br>Studies and at the University as well as<br>friends at the the Museum of Asia<br>Foundation Asia New Zealand foundation<br>for their warm hospitality bringing me<br>over to meet with so many old friends<br>and to meet a lot of new ones as well so<br>thank you thank you very very much so<br>today this evening take maybe 30 or 40<br>minutes at I want to take too long I<br>really want to try to get to a Q&amp;A as<br>soon as we can but just talk a little<br>bit about what my take on where I think<br>us-china relations are going in a word<br>or two I would just say not well and and<br>I think we have as you can see from the<br>title we should be expecting even<br>greater strategic competition going<br>forward and as I'll try to get into a<br>little bit more in depth this is so I<br>would say almost regardless of who is in<br>the White House and who is in Joan<br>non-high so there are I think certain<br>structural aspects to this relationship<br>that have been building up over the<br>years and which I think are going to be<br>with us for some time to come and this<br>these structural factors I think sort of<br>underlie and drive what's going to be<br>continuing a strategic competition<br>between these two countries for the<br>foreseeable future<br>near near to medium term certainly so<br>that's what I want to get into and try<br>to drill down on that<br>why I think that way right so just a<br>little quick presentation outline a<br>little bit of broader context that's<br>happening beyond the bilateral<br>relationship which i think is also<br>important for us to take into account as<br>a specialist I think you can all be<br>sympathetic we tend to you know look at<br>trees and not the forest all too often<br>but I'll try to give a little bit of<br>forest and then go through these aspects<br>of competition structural competition<br>that I see emerging in the relationship<br>and which will have enormous<br>implications for countries in this<br>region in particular but I think even at<br>a global level so here's some forestry I<br>guess you could say you know the<br>competition that we see between the<br>United States and changes a day<br>obviously does not take place in the<br>vacuum and you know I think is driven in<br>part by the larger context of what's<br>happening in Asia I think we can all<br>agree more or less that the end of<br>Pacific the Asia Pacific Asia whatever<br>you want to call it is the region's most<br>dynamic of the world is the region that<br>is the most dynamic in the world<br>certainly economically but I think in<br>many other interesting respects where it<br>had whether it has to do with sort of<br>simmering security tensions and other<br>political and diplomatic challenges it's<br>it's it's it's a region which is going<br>to really be I think the center of<br>gravity for world affairs for many many<br>more decades to come and I think it is<br>that importance then and its importance<br>to the United States as well as to China<br>that helps to drive much of the rivalry<br>we see as each of these great power<br>superpowers China and the United States<br>wants to take greatest advantage draw<br>our greatest benefit try to leverage<br>their relationships in the region to<br>their to their own if<br>and that in turn contributes to the<br>strategic rivalry between the two as<br>they seek to sort of dominate or come<br>out on top in this very very vibrant<br>region you know it's also true the<br>us-china rivalry is nothing particularly<br>new I mean I think you'd be hard-pressed<br>from 1949 to the present to to count on<br>more than one hand the number of years<br>where you could say that the two<br>countries had a you know normal trusting<br>strategic partnership so you know we've<br>been here before where the relationship<br>has had troubles and difficulties but I<br>do think that them as I'll get into<br>there are certainly some structural<br>aspects to through that rivalry today<br>which make it a lot more difficult and<br>then finally um what we're seeing I<br>think is a real shift as a result of<br>these rivalries in some of the public<br>moods if that's the right word I think<br>you can probably use that term pretty<br>well when you refer to the United States<br>certainly if you more narrowly define<br>the public view as that represented by<br>you know let's say inside the beltway<br>governance and and hangers-on within the<br>Beltway and then even in China I think<br>there is a certain souring I think a<br>that there was always within China sort<br>of underlying mistrust if that's the<br>right word or an underlying concern you<br>know that the United States at the end<br>of the day has peaceful evolution of<br>China as its ultimate goal but I think<br>even within that general frame of mind<br>there was a fair degree of openness and<br>willingness to find cooperative<br>solutions a willingness to work together<br>to resolve problems I<br>that that universe of the possible in<br>China is also getting smaller and<br>smaller and so even where there could be<br>areas of cooperation or common ground<br>the politics aren't good for it in<br>either capital at the moment I don't<br>think and in other words to maybe to put<br>it more sharply I would say that<br>increasingly the two sides view each<br>other in more adversarial terms than<br>they have even in the even in the past<br>five or ten years so in that context you<br>know sort of that some of those larger<br>issues that are unfolding I think we can<br>turn to then talking about what I see as<br>these critical structural changes across<br>three important elements of the<br>relationship which are really with us<br>for I think to stay for some time and<br>that that's going to then undergird<br>underpin this intensifying strategic<br>rivalry that I'm talking about three<br>areas first economic and technological<br>competition secondly security<br>competition and third we'll talk about<br>what I've called ideological competition<br>but I would be very open if others could<br>provide me with a a better term than<br>that but let's talk about economic<br>competition of course these two<br>countries have competed but I think that<br>the nature of the competition today is<br>changing and changing in ways that that<br>make this aspect of the relationship an<br>aspect of the relationship which is of<br>course traditionally been a kind of<br>safety net right it's sort of been the<br>area of last resort that was going to<br>preserve the relationship and stabilize<br>it because both sides saw enormous<br>benefit in their economic relationship<br>with one another you know that safety<br>net is frame because of the structural<br>changes that are occurring in the nature<br>of the competition and that list here a<br>couple of reasons why I think<br>that way I mean we're all familiar with<br>how under Xi Jinping in particular we've<br>seen a kind of reimburse of the state<br>and the role of the state in driving<br>that economy and even sort of exporting<br>that model in various forms and ways<br>abroad and in doing so I think you know<br>is seen then as unfairly competing with<br>more market oriented economies like the<br>United States and I think frustratingly<br>for the United States doing all of this<br>in a way in in defiance of supposed<br>free-market principles which seems to be<br>working<br>succeeding so that's you know I think<br>one problem the relationship is less<br>complimentary I mean as China goes up<br>the value chain and it's in its<br>productivity and manufacturing and etc<br>it increasingly becomes a competitor<br>with the United States rather than being<br>a complementary economic partner with<br>the United States you're getting into<br>areas where the United States had been<br>traditionally a world leader and showing<br>signs of maybe even overtaking the<br>United States in many critical economic<br>areas in the decades ahead and this is<br>what I mean by a technology you know an<br>aspect of that economic competition<br>seems to be increasingly centered on<br>technological competition and especially<br>so in cutting-edge technologies of 21st<br>century prosperity like artificial<br>intelligence in nanotechnology in<br>computing and in Big Data quantum<br>quantum computing in quantum<br>technologies of course 5g and and and<br>and other really important areas for<br>economic growth going forward it's not a<br>matter of you know China simply being a<br>link in the value chain for a mirror<br>and benefit in producing and selling<br>those technologies but becoming a direct<br>competitor to the United States and not<br>in some cases not just a competitor but<br>it's a world leader in these areas much<br>accusations and acrimony and hand<br>wringing in the United States over how<br>China got there<br>of course which often includes a lot of<br>accusations about industrial espionage<br>intellectual property theft and the like<br>again adding to this idea that well Tana<br>may be successful but it's done so sort<br>of an unfair ways in not good cricket<br>and getting to where they are not on the<br>basis of free-market principles but on<br>something more nefarious an article that<br>just came out of the Washington<br>quarterly by every Medeiros many of you<br>would know Evan formerly the senior<br>national security adviser for Asia to<br>President Obama now at Georgetown<br>University he's got an article in which<br>he makes the case that on top of all<br>this other stuff in the economic<br>competition that virtually any aspect of<br>economic development or economic<br>initiative or economic effort on China's<br>part is increasingly seen in Washington<br>through a security lens you know so I<br>mean there are those you know that's<br>what this decoupling is really all about<br>the notion you would decoupled from the<br>Chinese economy because any assistance<br>any form of cooperation with China even<br>in the seemingly most benign areas of<br>say economic cooperation<br>only leads to building Chinese power and<br>which of course China is going to use<br>contrary to American interests or so the<br>argument would go so the securitization<br>of Chinese economic<br>activities securitisation of how we<br>interpret chinese economic activities<br>such as the belt and road initiative or<br>the made in china 2025 effort these are<br>not merely economic and infrastructure<br>development programs these are programs<br>in this view which will strengthen china<br>as a security actor and as a challenger<br>to American leadership and primacy so<br>you know these are big big changes you<br>know in in the way that the United<br>States and China looked at one another<br>how they look at economic growth how<br>they look at the value and benefit of<br>economic interaction in competition and<br>in general it's moving in a quite<br>negative direction and I don't see I'd<br>be very open to hearing views but I<br>don't see how such you know in-depth<br>problems are going to be readily<br>resolved going forward and it's really<br>as I said the beginning most worrisome<br>to me because it has always been the<br>case that it was in the economic realm<br>where the benefits outweighed other<br>problems that we've traditionally had<br>with China whether it was his form of<br>governance Human Rights you know<br>assertive behaviors around its periphery<br>a lot of that could be forgiven or at<br>least overlooked or weighed in the<br>balance in a way that gave it less<br>priority because the economic benefit<br>was so great that's that whole way of<br>thinking about working with China is a<br>thing of the past it may come back at<br>some point but not anytime soon and<br>that's a real problem<br>does that have always been a sort of<br>safety net a second area of competition<br>that I think is becoming more<br>structurally embedded in the<br>relationship I would sort of put under<br>the general rubric of security<br>competition now once again nothing new<br>you know we've gone to war and their<br>take has gone to war against China in<br>the past and there have been plenty of<br>close calls since with China including<br>of course concerns that go beyond you<br>know kinetic conflict to problems around<br>non-proliferation and other security<br>concerns we we've had over the years<br>with China but it feels very different<br>now and I think it does a for a number<br>of reasons um whereas in the past when<br>China was in a weaker position I think<br>it was prepared to back down or to you<br>know sort of if reluctantly at least<br>acquiesce to or a lot lie low in<br>response to American concerns related to<br>security issues so you know not push the<br>envelope too hard being cross-strait a<br>relations for example not push too hard<br>on territorial claims with regard visa<br>vie a Japan and certainly not try to<br>assert quite grandiose claims to a<br>Chinese territorial sovereignty over<br>vast swaths of the South China Sea and<br>to back that up<br>with you know military assets to<br>presumably protect those claims China<br>today is far more capable and it appears<br>far more willing to challenge the United<br>States militarily or at least send the<br>signals that it is prepared<br>do so around a lot of very sensitive<br>issues in areas that that the leadership<br>in Beijing knows fully well the United<br>States you know over which the United<br>States would have interests and even<br>treaty commitments in the case of Japan<br>or the Philippines that's something<br>quite different that's something very<br>new and I think it's it's you know in<br>part arisen because China can you know<br>it's it's built up aspects of its<br>military in ways to make it more capable<br>of opposing these sorts of challenges<br>but I think it's also a reflection of Xi<br>Jinping's leadership itself this fellow<br>has big ideas big ambitions and I think<br>he's serious when he talks about the<br>great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation<br>and doing it sooner rather than later so<br>you have both the sort of technological<br>aspect to this which has grown<br>considerably in the last 10 to 15 years<br>plus a sort of political will overlay<br>represented you know in the person who's<br>leading China today but which I think is<br>not just him but I think reflects a<br>growing confidence within China about<br>what it would see as a reassertion of<br>Chinese interests a regaining of China's<br>rightful place as a regional and even<br>global leader I won't go into too much<br>detail on this third point but I've been<br>doing a lot of work of late looking at<br>the PLA reform and reorganization which<br>has been underway over the past four or<br>five years and while you know you never<br>know where these reforms and<br>reorganizations are going until the<br>shooting starts I suppose unfortunately<br>but you know on paper at least and in<br>terms of how the PLA is attempting to<br>organize itself and in terms of just raw<br>capabilities<br>the PLA is making remarkable advances<br>and you know any American or Japanese or<br>Taiwanese or Australian war planner who<br>isn't worried and isn't thinking very<br>carefully and cautiously about what can<br>and cannot be done within the first 100<br>miles or so of the Chinese shoreline<br>they'd be crazy I think I think there<br>has been a significant alteration in the<br>sort of the balance of the possible or<br>the balance of the militarily possible<br>particularly close in to the Chinese<br>periphery an area that people sometimes<br>call the first island chain in that<br>first sort of dotted line there I think<br>the the parameters of the possible for<br>the United States military and for its<br>allies are more and more constraining<br>and you and as you can see that envelops<br>or encompasses parts of the western<br>Pacific where the United States has<br>bases where the United States has treaty<br>commitments where the United States has<br>security commitments of a sort you know<br>under the Taiwan Relations Act to Taiwan<br>and of course broader interests you know<br>so say in the South China Sea to freedom<br>of navigation and the light so we are<br>entering a new era in the security<br>competition between the United States<br>and China and this is not going to<br>change it's not like China's gonna walk<br>back from the first island chain is if<br>anything it's going to continue to<br>expand its capabilities to project power<br>beyond the first island chain I mean the<br>the you know the the appearance of the<br>of the DF of 26a Guam killer in the<br>parade on October 1st is just the<br>beginning of what China is going to be<br>showing us it is capable of doing<br>all the while trying to push back push<br>the Americans back and of course install<br>deep questions into the minds of the<br>United States allies in this region<br>about just how far they're prepared to<br>go with the United States should a<br>conflict arise so real competition of<br>unfolding there I think and I worry I<br>mean I think we're coming up to some<br>very important anniversaries for China<br>we know that Xi Jinping is likely to<br>want to stay in power well beyond his<br>previously a norm normative limit of 10<br>years<br>and I think a part of the reason his<br>party will support him in that<br>would be in the expectation that some of<br>the major strategic goals of the<br>rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will<br>be achieved under his leadership and of<br>course that includes reassertion of<br>so I think we're in for a pretty bumpy<br>ride over the next five to 10 years and<br>again this is a structural aspect it<br>doesn't matter if Donald Trump is<br>president it doesn't matter if she<br>Jinping is the president I think this is<br>a confrontation that is going to be with<br>us regardless and then lastly and maybe<br>most controversially<br>we could say and and I'm not as firm in<br>my convictions about this aspect of<br>competition but I think it's well worth<br>discussing because I well I'm just<br>fascinated by Chinese domestic politics<br>and what Xi Jinping is doing and it does<br>spill over in<br>how China chooses to conduct itself in<br>the international arena including in its<br>bilateral relationship with the United<br>States okay it's not new you know I<br>think since October 1st 1949 you could<br>you could argue Washington has never<br>been real happy about the fact that the<br>Chinese Communist Party runs China<br>there's always been an element of<br>ideological angst and unhappiness with<br>that reality even as the country China<br>you know opened up to the outside world<br>became more reformed and we've seen some<br>elements of greater openness and reform<br>even when that's happened I think there<br>was still an underlying concern about<br>the long-term legitimacy and nature of<br>this regime so that's nothing<br>particularly new what's different though<br>this time is what's happened<br>particularly I think under under Xi<br>Jinping um so at the same time the<br>Chinese becoming a stiffer economic<br>competitor and of becoming more capable<br>of competing with and confronting the<br>United States militarily speaking around<br>areas of sensitivity to the United<br>States we've also witnessed this<br>doubling down on the centrality of the<br>Chinese Communist Party to the<br>governance inside China and all but<br>here's where it really begins to rub<br>people the wrong way as a part of that I<br>would say rebirth or new centrality of<br>the party in the affairs of state inside<br>China we've seen a I think significant<br>increase in the empowerment of party<br>organizations to operate a bra<br>and to conduct their activities more<br>actively sometimes clandestinely<br>approbation and acceptance of China as<br>it is not as it as we might want it to<br>be and of course I'm speaking here of<br>you know the activities of organizations<br>like the International Liaison<br>Department the propaganda department<br>sorry the Chinese English translation of<br>that these days even though it's the<br>same word its publicity Department and<br>I'll stick with I'll stick with<br>propaganda because it has such an<br>important meaning in in English and of<br>course the united front department and<br>overseas chinese work etc etc all<br>central party organs increasingly<br>empowered to operate and resources not<br>just politically empowered but<br>financially resourced to operate abroad<br>getting China's message out there in<br>various ways finding friends finding<br>partners finding like-minded or<br>supportive organizations and individuals<br>with the aim of legitimizing the Chinese<br>Communist Party and its method of rule<br>and its form of governance so that it<br>can survive into the future that's<br>really quite new the degree to which<br>it's been financed and resourced and<br>pushed out to the international level<br>it's always been there that's what the<br>International agent Department is always<br>supposed to do that's what the united<br>front department has always done but<br>it's different and more resourced and<br>more active and actually quite more open<br>in many respects it's again a reflection<br>of this confidence that the party has<br>about its success and its intention to<br>be there for a long long time to come<br>the problem of course is that this<br>generates competition and conflict and<br>concern within especially within more<br>liberal let's call them liberal<br>democracies including the United States<br>and amongst the United States most<br>important allies and partners around<br>this region so I'm not sure if IDIA<br>logical competition is quite right but<br>to the degree we learn that China is I<br>mean Beijing denies this but the degree<br>to which it is seeking to export some<br>aspects of its governance model to other<br>parts of the world well then it does<br>become in a way a kind of ideological<br>competition between you know the<br>traditional Western liberal democratic<br>capitalist model of diplomacy of<br>connectivity and the like versus one<br>which gives centrality to authoritarian<br>party organizations in the conduct of<br>their international activity gives<br>priority to state-based forms of<br>economic activity and of course over all<br>seeks to legitimate and make normal the<br>idea that it's okay to have an<br>authoritarian surveillance state I'm not<br>just in China but in other parts of the<br>world as well that's that's really<br>different this is a competition of ideas<br>about which form of governance works and<br>which is better and at the end of the<br>day for for people and it doesn't help<br>that we in the Liberal Democratic West<br>are in our own sort of a moment of<br>crisis and lack of faith<br>so you know it just has a stronger feel<br>of of competitiveness in a way that I<br>don't recall it being you know since the<br>opening of the Chinese reform era in the<br>late 1970s<br>so across these three areas economics<br>security and let's call it ideas or<br>values Medeiros calls it governance we<br>see I think an intensifying competition<br>and again this isn't happening in some<br>vacuum this affects all of us as<br>individuals and as you know government<br>and institutional leaders as citizens of<br>our states this affects us greatly and<br>you know I think it's time we try to if<br>I think we already are trying to figure<br>out what to do about it you know how do<br>we in our own societies manage this<br>relationship this very important<br>bilateral relationship that's sort of<br>looming above us between the United<br>States and China but also do so in a way<br>that is is true to our own values and<br>interests as nations and as individuals<br>I have a few ideas here of how we should<br>be thinking about this you know standing<br>on one side and hoping this goes away<br>forget it this is a this is a a show<br>that's coming to you soon if it hasn't<br>already and it's gonna be with us so I<br>think innocent by standing clearly is<br>not an option I know it's not easy for<br>government leaders or institution<br>leaders to come out firmly on one side<br>or the other of this and maybe that's<br>not the right way to look at it it's not<br>an either or option necessarily you know<br>either China or the United States I<br>think that's that's losing before you<br>even begin<br>but it's not going to be easy to try and<br>balance these twos but but I think you<br>know it would be good for societies<br>especially open societies to have a more<br>intensive debate about this intensifying<br>strategic competition and what it means<br>for us I mean I live in Australia now<br>I've been there for about seven years I<br>think Australia I mean it's been a<br>pretty raucous debate I think it's<br>sometimes been under-informed but<br>nevertheless it's been pretty intense<br>and pretty wide open and even at the<br>highest levels of government leaders are<br>prepared to recognize that this is a<br>problem a challenge that that Australia<br>needs to deal with I think that's<br>probably generally a good thing I've<br>I've recently written something for the<br>Aged of society Australia they did their<br>big disruptive Asia series this year on<br>China and asked me to write the opening<br>essay and what I tried to do was come up<br>with a term that would sort of define<br>what is the era that we're going into<br>and I we sort of brainstormed and came<br>up with a psyche of bounded engagement<br>what do we mean well you know the idea<br>of decoupling or sort of somehow not<br>engaging with the country like China is<br>pretty ridiculous and really not<br>practicable but what we're going into I<br>think is an era in which the the<br>parameters are the possible the the<br>possibilities of engagement are going to<br>narrow and become more bounded so we far<br>less open-ended and expansive than it<br>was say even five or ten years ago and I<br>think if we if we can think in those<br>terms that may help guide us forward you<br>sort of understand that engagement of<br>course but there's gonna be more<br>restrictions on that engagement there's<br>gonna be you know less openness in many<br>respects about partners partnering and<br>engaging with China but that doesn't<br>mean that maybe what that means is that<br>maybe priority is about engage enough to<br>move into areas that are<br>would be less sensitive but still<br>constructive in the way that a given<br>country wants to relate to China we see<br>in many in many capitals these days an<br>effort to try and diversify to establish<br>new forms of relationships that don't<br>include either China or the United<br>States you know trying to find you know<br>safety in numbers I guess you might say<br>and I think there been a couple of quite<br>interesting examples of that you know<br>Japan India Economic Cooperation Japan<br>EU working together Australia and Japan<br>are stepping up their security<br>cooperation there's a lot I'm sure New<br>Zealand has many examples of this as<br>well and it probably is a pretty wise<br>strategy you know not putting all of<br>your eggs into either the US or the<br>China basket and trying to find<br>constructive and useful forms of<br>cooperation with others again easier<br>said than done I mean China is such an<br>enormous ly important market to New<br>Zealand or to a country like Australia<br>it's not something you can just<br>diversify away from magically but<br>nevertheless I think more thinking about<br>how to build up partnerships with other<br>emerging and important players in the<br>region like Japan like Indonesia like<br>India and others would be a wise way<br>forward given this strategic environment<br>of competition between the United States<br>and China that we see coming forward as<br>I say there's gonna be a lot more<br>difficult it's not easy governments and<br>institutions I think it will have a hard<br>time with this it's probably gonna<br>require a lot more nuance and<br>sophistication which you know is not<br>something you just pick up off the shelf<br>and plug into your current policy and<br>make it work I suppose<br>I'm always arguing for putting in a lot<br>more resources into understanding China<br>and to being you know having those<br>resources available then to our<br>governments and institutions so that you<br>can tread that more nuanced if sometimes<br>prickly a balanced pathway to avoid the<br>worst outcomes with China while still<br>maintaining some forms of constructive<br>relations and you know as much as I hate<br>to say it a lot of the old sibilants and<br>truisms about the United States are<br>gonna have to be thrown out the window<br>too<br>I think I'm not sure that Donald Trump<br>is an aberration as to how the United<br>States is going to conduct itself in the<br>world going forward and so maybe<br>maybe some resources also need to be<br>devoted to doing an even better and<br>deeper job of understanding the<br>directions the United States may be<br>taking even though those are very<br>say here that if there were a new<br>president we might see some change in<br>this dynamic but I don't think it's<br>gonna be in the way that you would like<br>or that many would like in the reason<br>why did I say that I was in in in in in<br>Beijing a few weeks ago and was quoted<br>by one of the state media as saying that<br>to their surprise they were quite<br>shocked that I said this I said you guys<br>would be happy to have Donald Trump<br>remain as president and they were like<br>how can that be you know he's so tough<br>on us and trade and tariffs and all that<br>stuff and I said yeah but you know he's<br>letting the whole American alliance<br>system collapse and and and I don't<br>think he really you know wants to go to<br>war with you and you he's easily<br>manipulated and it's very easy to to<br>know what his interests are and to play<br>to them and sure enough<br>on the New Zealand journalists is it<br>onif I feel Durant and Fifield just came<br>out with an article yesterday the day<br>before in the Washington Post it said<br>exactly this quoting senior Chinese<br>officials who said yeah Trump's easy to<br>play but more importantly I think if we<br>if we were to get another Republican<br>president even a Mike Pence or a<br>democratic a traditional Democratic<br>president I think they're gonna come<br>knocking on your door and on Australia's<br>door and on Japan's door and on South<br>Korea's door and on Philippines door and<br>revive try to revive and do more than<br>revive but rebuild the traditional<br>Alliance relationships in this region<br>which have sort of gone wanting in<br>recent years of them most particularly<br>under Donald Trump who see value in<br>those Alliance relationships precisely<br>for what they mean for the competition<br>with China for the long term competition<br>of China and you know that's if that's<br>true if that's what does come to pass<br>that's gonna be very uncomfortable for a<br>lot of capitals in the region and so<br>watch out what you wish for if you if<br>you are wishing for somebody other than<br>Donald Trump in the White House and I<br>just sort of wrap it up with the obvious<br>I mean I think this is this is this is a<br>phenomena and it's gonna be with us so<br>we need to I think think be thinking a<br>lot harder about it be more prepared for<br>it and invest the sorts of resources<br>that are needed in terms of personnel<br>and education to help us better respond<br>thank you so much Bates we've got a<br>little bit over half an hour for<br>questions and answers so if I could<br>actually please - if you try and catch<br>my attention I'll keep an informal role<br>around the region around the room and if<br>I could ask you're not going to use<br>microphones through the through the<br>audience but if - so if I could ask you<br>just to speak up clearly and if I could<br>ask you please so that we can try and<br>well you're right I didn't I I didn't<br>utter the words cold war which which is<br>I think a popular meme these days when<br>when people talk about the direction of<br>the relationship with China I don't<br>think it's a good analogy I mean I think<br>I think that well to the degree that<br>that term is one that was defined you<br>know as the relationship between the two<br>cult of the two powers the Soviet Union<br>and the United States you know who had<br>every<br>possibility or and actually did conduct<br>you know third-party warfare against one<br>another and not only that but were<br>literally separated from one another<br>across particularly economic lines then<br>you know it's not a very good analogy I<br>don't think to what we're what we're<br>seeing with China if if by cold war we<br>mean something a little mushy ER you<br>know in terms of you know animosity with<br>one another some slow disengagement<br>between the two countries<br>never shooting at one another so<br>therefore it's cold but competing in<br>across these various areas that I<br>outlined there well then I suppose you<br>could say cold war but I'd I prefer the<br>the sort of former understanding of what<br>what the cold war means and it's very<br>different as you as you noted China does<br>not have a range of Alliance alliances<br>in the same way that the Soviet Union<br>did China does not even have the kind of<br>influence or suzerainty if you want to<br>call it that over large portions of<br>territory like in Europe as the Soviet<br>Union did and I think that's purposeful<br>I think China understands that that kind<br>of competition but the United States is<br>probably be quite dangerous and so it's<br>attempting I think to compete or find<br>ways to compete with the United States<br>that are less controversial and less<br>less sensitive I don't know if that<br>answers your question but I'm happy to<br>entertain other thoughts but I just<br>don't I don't think the Cold War analogy<br>is quite right Suz and getting another<br>important thing is that you know even<br>though even though these two countries<br>are into this<br>quite intensive competition I wouldn't<br>go so far as to say that the China is<br>sort of trying to overturn or establish<br>some sort of a new world order there's<br>much of the world order that it<br>continues to benefit from quite a bit<br>and it would even like to be seen as a<br>pillar of those aspects of the world<br>order like the United Nations China at<br>least rhetorically you know is probably<br>one of the make biggest supporters of<br>I think at the moment there's a lot of<br>great deal of frustration with that idea<br>that that no the the ways which the sort<br>of you know diplomatic and political<br>leaders of the past thought they could<br>shape China's rise failed that's that's<br>that's really the sort of common theme<br>in Washington these days right the sort<br>of the the idea that there was a naivete<br>in the extreme that I think it's wrong<br>had to but this is what people say you<br>know that the belief that you could<br>change China through economic engagement<br>and the like has proven wrong so your<br>question really is what's the<br>alternative then you know what's what's<br>what's the big idea then that's going to<br>replace that and right now the way it<br>looks at least among I would say let's<br>say the majority of the inside the<br>beltway crowd maybe not President Trump<br>himself interestingly but I think many<br>many other important voices are to push<br>back to and to do it with military<br>strength revived Alliance relationships<br>increased deployments of various<br>military capabilities in the region more<br>strong assurances and extensions of<br>security guarantees to the place like<br>Taiwan and then on the economic front<br>getting out you know not doing things<br>that help the Chinese economy that's<br>that's where I see the mood going right<br>now<br>now interestingly you know I'm not<br>I hate trying to gaze into the mind of<br>Donald Trump and try to understand what<br>he might really be thinking and I and<br>I'll admit right off off the bat that I<br>I'm reluctant to give him any credit for<br>for true strategic thinking but he I<br>think he probably does represent to a<br>degree a a persistent but minority<br>element in the American body politic<br>which is fundamentally isolationists you<br>know and believes that America has been<br>taken for a ride and and has been<br>unfairly treated even by its best<br>friends and that it's time to come home<br>and to work on the problems we've got<br>rather than everybody else's problems I<br>think that's probably where he would be<br>if he ever if we could sit him down and<br>so I'm not sure he's he I don't think he<br>himself would be all that support of<br>about a you know a more confrontational<br>'list approach to China he himself but I<br>think a lot of people are and you know<br>like I say that's going to create<br>problems out here with our friends in<br>New Zealand with our friends in<br>Australia with our friends even in Japan<br>who you know I don't think are quite as<br>prepared to go down the pathway of<br>confrontation with China that I think<br>we're going to see emerge in the coming<br>years okay I've got lots of hands going<br>up now so I'll try and keep track of it<br>I apologize if I try not to pursue this<br>well on the second part of the question<br>yes I think there's has been a change of<br>course you know as anyone who deals with<br>China knows you know the sorts of people<br>that a person like me can talk to you<br>know our five or six runs down the<br>decision-making ladder so you know you<br>have to you have to try and interpret<br>what the leadership might be thinking<br>the real decision-makers might be<br>thinking you know through this filtered<br>lens that comes down to people like me<br>so you know I don't claim to have any<br>you know so special insights into what's<br>going on and say China but I detect a<br>real change in mood and attitude a<br>willingness to find common ground and a<br>greater degree of confidence and<br>self-assurance and and increasingly I<br>would even say a kind of that's the word<br>I want then a kind of umbrage almost<br>with the way China has been treated and<br>continues to be treated by the likes of<br>the United States and you know that's<br>fine I'm not saying that's a bad thing<br>you know that's I think understandable<br>given the success<br>particularly the country but it affects<br>the diplomatic move and it narrows the<br>possibilities for finding seeking common<br>ground I think I think my interpretation<br>of the Chinese body politic these days<br>is that they're in a lot less mood to<br>compromise or to find common ground<br>because they think that the United<br>States hasn't given anything and they<br>deserve China deserves to be treated<br>respectfully to be congratulated not<br>criticized for its success and and and<br>and and point to you know how their<br>success has benefited so many others<br>around the region and even and even<br>globally and that that should be taken<br>into account right so you can sort of<br>understand why they would think that way<br>almost a kind of getting fed up with<br>being treated in a second-class way and<br>that that trickles down into the way<br>that conversations are had and the way<br>that the way that compromises can and<br>cannot be found and I think we're just<br>we're just entering a period of a much<br>greater friction and I think potentially<br>volatility just because the positions<br>are hardening and but as I said in in<br>every Mars if you believe that any type<br>of cooperation with the other side<br>only embolden is there assertiveness<br>then you know you're never you're not<br>gonna get anywhere less that's a problem<br>I'm sorry the first part of your<br>right well you know there's that there's<br>an increased tempo and this is under<br>Donald Trump although I don't know how<br>much he had to say in this but there is<br>now an increased tempo in American<br>activity and and surveillance and the<br>offshore in the South China Sea and<br>elsewhere I think the possibility of an<br>accident a very dangerous and exit<br>turning into something more escalatory<br>is quite possible I guess I worry a<br>little more over the longer term<br>the degree to which si Jinping feels<br>that something has to change<br>in the way in the relationship at Taiwan<br>that again escalate I'm not I'm not<br>envisioning any kind of an invasion or<br>something like that but maybe something<br>like you know the missile tests of 96-97<br>or something of that nature I sort of<br>shot across the bow of Taiwan separate<br>separatists if that's the right word<br>which would then escalate into something<br>bigger that's quite quite possible if<br>I'm right that the next president is<br>going to work harder to develop a kind<br>of coalition of the friends and allies<br>around China that could spark a real<br>push back from China because if we if we<br>change the nature of the relationship<br>with Taiwan for example which the Trump<br>administration has said they are<br>prepared to do you know change move away<br>from some of the former diplomatic<br>niceties of our relationship with Taiwan<br>to give it you know more sophisticated<br>weaponry boost its status diplomatically<br>in different ways<br>I mean that could spark a reaction from<br>China<br>I don't see that and I think it's one of<br>the paradoxes really of China's rise in<br>many respects is very few I would say of<br>none of traditional is called them<br>Western democracies and I would include<br>South Korea and Japan and that I don't<br>think there's much appetite at all for<br>the Chinese model now I think that's<br>less true for others who might be you<br>know and this that you have a you know a<br>strong state control that clearly has<br>brought about the economic miracle that<br>china is has become a bit of envy there<br>so I wouldn't call it sort of<br>exportation of communism per se but<br>maybe broaden it out more and it's it<br>the phenomenon and I would say is<br>something more like you know the march<br>of authoritarianism because we're having<br>our own crisis of confidence right in<br>our democracies in many respects sure<br>surely that's the case in the United<br>to the degree that you start casting<br>about for other models right you know<br>this this democracy is way too messy and<br>so let's let's get a little more order<br>in our political life so that we can<br>deal with the problems that we have more<br>effectively and I think that's that mood<br>I'm not sure that reflects I don't think<br>that's something China is seeking to<br>export necessarily but I think they<br>would find that kind of a world a more<br>comfortable one to operate in because<br>there would be less approbation about<br>them right and and and how they conduct<br>themselves and how they treat their<br>citizens and the like and so I think<br>that would be a world in which spazing<br>would be a lot more comfortable and to<br>the degree they can hold up that model<br>as being a success story then that<br>probably benefits them but I don't I<br>don't see them you know they don't have<br>a common turn I don't see them trying to<br>actively export such such models and<br>they claim that that's not what they're<br>doing that every country you know has to<br>decide on its own how its going to<br>govern itself but but that said we know<br>that China the cut in the country the<br>the government does export tools at<br>least and ideas of how to have a<br>successful economy under the conditions<br>of authoritarian or semi authoritarian<br>rule so it's a mixed picture but I don't<br>think they're gonna be so just get back<br>to original question I don't think that<br>we we've in the Liberal Democratic West<br>I don't think there's a lot of appetite<br>for adopting the Chinese governance<br>model okay I'm gonna have to cut off the<br>hands up there I'm gonna take a couple<br>of questions at the time now just so we<br>get through them so first of all Jason<br>yang please<br>I really enjoy it take one more question<br>at the same time what do you think about<br>that very difficult question the<br>gentleman at the back I'm sorry China's<br>a potential witness so we'll take one<br>more question<br>so the question on founded engagement<br>and then a question of issues around the<br>massed attention of Wiggins how is that<br>influencing I think to China's soft<br>power right well I think we already see<br>underway certainly in Australia where<br>I'm following it much closely and I have<br>to admit a fair bit of ignorance as to<br>how New Zealand is is dealing with this<br>but we see no concrete steps being taken<br>to narrow the parameters are the<br>possible in the relationship with with<br>China I think there's a great deal more<br>sort of realism certainly within let's<br>call it the you know national security<br>crowd in in Australia serious efforts<br>underway to restrict and bound narrow<br>the parameters of the possible for<br>engagement with China and I think it's<br>even beginning to creep into elements of<br>suspect that's going to continue and<br>while I think because of the importance<br>of China economically to Australia there<br>are the occasional efforts by the<br>government to sort of show good faith or<br>demonstrate an interest in a positive<br>and constructive relationship with China<br>just so that China will not lower the<br>boom I mean remarkably I mean I think by<br>certain indices Australia is one of the<br>most dependent countries economically<br>speaking on China so it's quite<br>remarkable in some ways that China<br>hasn't lowered the boom when you<br>consider some of the steps they have<br>taken like you know the new security<br>laws and foreign interference laws some<br>of the statements that the leaders of<br>the government had made visa vie China<br>so I think we we will see a sort of<br>narrowing of the parameters of the<br>possible with<br>with China going forward then we have a<br>question about the Wii gorgeous right<br>I'm sorry course is that right um well<br>it's been pretty shocking to me that<br>what's what we think we know about<br>what's happening<br>you seen John and the lack of response<br>from the international community I don't<br>know where to pin the blame for that<br>exactly I think it part is because<br>what's happening in Washington you know<br>Washington would normally sort of be the<br>the first to speak up and and and and<br>try to mobilize international<br>coalition's in response to this type of<br>thing and that leadership is pretty<br>sorely lacking at the moment but I am<br>also shocked that you know very very few<br>others governments at least have been<br>prepared to speak out very strongly<br>about what's happened that's not<br>surprising to me but maybe that just<br>tells you the degree to which we have<br>all become sort of engaged with china<br>ways that we don't want to upset the<br>applecart which is precisely what the<br>Chinese would hope so I find it pretty<br>pretty worrisome you know whether or not<br>I think you said could that change well<br>I guess they could come back to bite<br>them in a couple of ways right it could<br>but I don't think either these two or<br>three pathways are likely to happen in<br>ways that are going to be seriously<br>detrimental to China I mean one that you<br>might have expected would have been some<br>sort of response from the from the<br>Islamic community but of course the<br>problem there is a many of the leaders<br>in the Islamic community have their own<br>concerns domestically with radical<br>radicalized elements of their society so<br>you know they may have some sympathy for<br>what China's trying to do so I don't<br>suspect that there's gonna be much<br>backlash there<br>and of course the West has been<br>relatively quiet on this pretty anodyne<br>so a statements of condemnation about<br>what's happening even though you know<br>with the release of the documents and<br>the I mean they allow the film crews<br>Chinese allow the film crews into those<br>camps earlier before the international<br>program began to build so even with all<br>of that evidence in front of us we've<br>been pretty silent be quiet I was saying<br>to somebody today I mean I know this<br>might get me in some trouble but you<br>know what if they were rounding up<br>Christians and putting them in camps do<br>you think the International we actually<br>in the West would be a little stronger I<br>think probably so so you know that's<br>very cynical on my part to say that but<br>I I do I do think that that may well be<br>one of the factors here in the lack of<br>response from the from the sort of<br>mainstream Western governments and it's<br>it's it's very worrisome you know the<br>only the only other sort of backlash I<br>suppose that could occur I suppose could<br>emerge from within within the Muslim<br>communities the weaker community in<br>China but you know I think that's not<br>likely because of the controls that they<br>exercised over that community so<br>unfortunately I think this is it's gonna<br>be with us for a while this gentleman<br>behaved<br>thank you and even in a society yeah now<br>if I understand your question correctly<br>you were saying that wind china becomes<br>a developed country I could argue both<br>part of what we're seeing the things<br>that we don't like about China today<br>you know it's authoritarian nature it's<br>you know it's it's it's reaction to or<br>creating the problems that we see<br>helping create the problems that we see<br>in Hong Kong<br>you could you could argue our sign of<br>his weakness and that we're more<br>confident and more respected and seen by<br>the international community as an<br>acceptable and positively contributing<br>part of the international community and<br>if that if that were all to play out in<br>a smooth way<br>I would not see that necessarily as a<br>bad outcome for the world so you could<br>you could see you could you could weave<br>scenarios whereby a more developed China<br>emerges in ways that our say boys you<br>couldn't but I take your point that you<br>know maybe you know if it emerges in a<br>way that is sort of firmly establishes<br>the authoritarian model of governance as<br>the month as the more preferred or<br>brings about a degree of confidence to<br>the Chinese leadership that it you know<br>tries to upset status quos around its<br>periphery like Taiwan most importantly<br>then that would be very dangerous it<br>could be very very dangerous for for the<br>International international system so I<br>think I think the question you raised is<br>a very good one if their trajectory<br>towards developed country status<br>continues is that is that going to be<br>good for the world of bad for world<br>that's what you're asking basically and<br>I think I think there's a there's a<br>valid argument to be made the debt is<br>going to be a more dangerous world I<br>think I'd like to believe that that's<br>not the case but I think you could argue<br>it argue it both ways the Hong Kong<br>situation is really very very<br>interesting I think and and I think it<br>reinforces for me this understanding of<br>China that I think we all need to keep<br>in mind and I realize it may be much of<br>my my presentation did not keep it in<br>mind but you know there are real<br>weaknesses there right I mean it's not<br>this all-powerful juggernaut that's<br>going to run us all over and take over<br>the world it's got some major problems<br>and the Hong Kong is just one of them<br>and or what I should say is what's<br>happening in Hong Kong is reflective of<br>a kind of weakness or lack of certainty<br>which of course the Beijing regime does<br>not want us to see or believe but I<br>think it's there and for all of China's<br>power and for all of its economic growth<br>and for all of its continued march<br>towards developed world status as<br>analysts I think it really is important<br>to remember that there's some huge<br>problems and that may well be why I mean<br>I think it does go a long way to<br>explaining why she Jinping is taking the<br>decisions he's taken to reassert a more<br>authoritarian and party centric model<br>for Chinese governance not because he's<br>confident but rather because he's scared<br>that if he doesn't do that that the<br>country is at risk of a frame so and<br>maybe Hong Kong is one example of that<br>fragility is that the word or or lack of<br>unity lack of support for the direction<br>that Xi Jinping has chosen to take the<br>country so I guess I sort of see Hong<br>Kong through that lens that it's a<br>reflection of unhappiness and lack of<br>support within China and I and I think<br>Hong Kong is part of China it's a<br>special part of China but it's a part<br>time and you know they are not going to<br>go quietly in you know into being<br>absorbed by the mainland and they're not<br>the only ones I think in different parts<br>of China who don't necessarily like the<br>direction that the country is turned<br>China in in recent years so it's I see<br>it as a I see Hong Kong as a symptom of<br>a larger set of<br>which see Jinping has chosen to deal<br>with through greater authoritarianism<br>and wolfsie whether he succeeds at that<br>if if Hong Kong and what's happening<br>there is any indication it's me it's not<br>a done deal for the Communist Party well<br>on that note we're after 7 o'clock my<br>apologies to the many people who<br>signaled that they had a question in<br>mind I'm sorry it's back the greatest<br>compliment you can give a speaker that<br>there was still plenty of questions<br>still to be asked but you might have a<br>chance to ask Bates the question<br>afterwards I think y'all agree we've<br>been training to a really stimulating<br>discussion tonight really interesting<br>framework for thinking about this<br>intensifying strategic competition<br>that's coming and listening to fate so a<br>sort of reminded of trotsky's maxim that<br>you might not be interested in war but<br>war is interested in you and and you<br>might not be interested in strategic<br>competition but strategic competition is<br>interested in you so this is something<br>we're gonna have to live with for the<br>foreseeable future and perhaps as an<br>opportunity to have debates back to talk<br>about this again at some point before<br>too long please join with me in thanking<br>professor</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
