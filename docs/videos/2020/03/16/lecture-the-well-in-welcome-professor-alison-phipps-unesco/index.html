And how do different intercultural understandings of wellbeing support societal flourishing?<br><br>This lecture brought to you by Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Otago, examines the international Refugees Welcome movement in the context of creating a flourishing, inclusive society founded on principles of wellbeing.<br><br>From the wellbeing budgeting in ANZ to the recent TEDx talk on Wellbeing and GDP by the First Minister of Scotland, it is clear that the question of what it means to live well, be well and to measure wellness are now hot political topics, at least in certain countries. The concept of wellbeing, placed within the context of medical humanities allows us to consider questions of societal flourishing and political expediency from an entirely different standpoint to those of economic growth. That the roots for the word for wellbeing, in English, come from the same old etymological root as that of welcome provides us with a place to pause, and consider what wellness might be, what it means to be well-come and to return to older sources of knowledge and wisdom, together.<br><br>Using poetry, image, and music, this lecture considers how wellness is made within the precarious contexts of flight, the fraught spaces of arrival and integration, and in the philosophies of societies. In particular, it will look at intercultural understandings of wellness and wellbeing through work undertaken in Zimbabwe, Ghana, Uganda, Scotland and the Gaza Strip, to open out our understandings and measures to a greater diversity.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>yaaaaah koto nami he

I'd like to<br>just give you a heads up that this<br>lecture is being publicly recorded so<br>this is the eighth and final talk of the<br>prestigious to Cal distinguished<br>lectureship series which was awarded to<br>the University of Otago center for<br>global migrations to fund an extensive<br>visit to New Zealand by professor<br>Allison Phipps the t-coil series of<br>talks is designed to promote and to<br>encourage learning among a wide audience<br>and we are delighted that Victoria<br>University of Wellington is co-hosting<br>this event with us as we all make the<br>most of having Ellison visit us and<br>Willington Thank You Alison Ellison<br>comes to us returning to Wellington as<br>she said not a stranger you lovely<br>people keep inviting<br>we back here now as the UNESCO chair in<br>refugee integration through languages<br>and the arts and professor of languages<br>and intercultural studies at the<br>University of Glasgow this is the first<br>time that Ellison and I admit but I can<br>already appreciate why we collectively<br>keep inviting her back all here likely<br>have a shared interest with her in the<br>well-being and health of people forced<br>to move from their homes and travel far<br>to new lives more personally Ellison has<br>taken politicians to witness refugees<br>and the Calais refugee camp with mitts<br>on some frontier an organization I<br>belong to you and we found a shared<br>belief that one does not have to have an<br>either-or mentality when considering<br>health service provision and welcome in<br>support using society respect for<br>languages in the power of the Arts we're<br>also extremely lucky to have her here as<br>I found out today because she's sort of<br>on strike all your colleagues are out<br>and a Tory know -8° on strike as part of<br>an academic protest and let's go but<br>apparently if you're in an international<br>trip you don't have to strike so we're<br>very lucky and allison described herself<br>to me as a part of lament but i already<br>hear so much more per former<br>distinguished academic and i especially<br>like a colleagues description of her as<br>an activist scholar i think we all look<br>forward to hearing her speak today<br>allison is intending to speak until<br>about 6:30 and then we have another 25<br>minutes allocated for questions in<br>discussion before we wrap up there may<br>be a bit of flexibility with how those<br>times are used tena koe totin okoto tina<br>Kirra<br>jonathan tena koutou tena koutou tena<br>koutou katoa and thank you to the dakar<br>lecture series particularly my colleague<br>professor Angela McCarthy sitting at the<br>back and also others in the centre for<br>global migrations to Jonathan and to<br>Professor Sara Kingdom and her team here<br>at Victoria University Wellington for<br>hosting me and inviting me back again<br>and I suddenly think some familiar faces<br>and people I've seen in other places<br>around the country I come to you today<br>from a tea party Dunedin on a flight<br>which was relocating a Syrian family you<br>have come to know in Hamilton where they<br>assure me it will be warmer and where<br>the people sitting next to me were<br>complaining in loud voices about the<br>fact that there were refugees on the<br>plane and they shouldn't be allowed<br>because they were taking space up in the<br>overhead lockers that they wanted and I<br>was greeted here at the airport by an<br>Ethiopian who spoke to me in Amharic and<br>integra Mia<br>and who talked to me passionately and<br>with pride about the Prime Minister of<br>Ethiopia his recent winning of the Nobel<br>Peace Prize and our joint love of<br>politics peace building and injera that<br>great Ethiopian pancake and I bring you<br>greetings from the snow-capped mountains<br>of Ben Lomond and the red Clyde were as<br>Jonathan said we're on strike again and<br>I do so with someone coming from a<br>family that is half refugee and made up<br>of people through history who were<br>cleared from the land<br>I'd also just like to acknowledge<br>plaintiff inoa and Mickey particularly<br>too picky diamond and heroin Easton who<br>have given me some lovely pointers as<br>I've been learning about aspects of<br>Theriot Maori that's part of my time<br>here first Jonathan said we're on strike<br>in the UK at the moment and thankfully<br>I'm not because when you travel overseas<br>you don't have to be on strike but also<br>wanted to let you know that everything I<br>say today I have to say without<br>acknowledging funders in the UK because<br>we're presently in a time of perder as<br>we call it a very odd term for us to use<br>but it means that any public academic or<br>public servant is not actually allowed<br>to mention where they get their public<br>funds from because it might turn the<br>results of the election if only if only<br>but I also come to you at this time at a<br>time worldwide where we know that once<br>again by many fascism is desired and<br>that is what we have to explain where we<br>see hearts breaking and broken daily<br>with the tragedies that are unfolding on<br>borders around the world and we see<br>particularly amongst our young people a<br>renewal of energy around protests<br>particularly around climate action and<br>the refugees welcome movement but also a<br>renewal of what we might call the<br>decolonial task that was very much part<br>and parcel of the work of the 1940s and<br>50s and 60s but is very strong again on<br>campuses and which i think is relevant<br>to the questions of well-being that a<br>part of what I want to talk to you about<br>today in her beautiful one-woman play<br>the singer-songwriter Kareem Paul what<br>rights myth about the well-being of the<br>geese she says in September the geese<br>sneaking across the Firth of Forth<br>from their summer nests in Iceland and<br>the coastal cliffs of Greenland<br>cluttering<br>honking in an ever-shifting scheme my<br>garden is a flight path I watch I listen<br>the outstretched wing tips of each<br>migrating goose creates an up watch a<br>pocket of wind resistance for the geese<br>tucked in behind and below these nooks<br>of ease these aerodynamic sanctuaries<br>they cut the drag for all by up to 65%<br>it's a wonder and it's a Gayle bitten<br>struggle to sustain cooperation every<br>goose take four turn stepping up falling<br>back laboring under esting stepping up<br>falling back laboring under esting like<br>sky born socialists no lone bird bears<br>the brunt<br>it's a gorgeous symbiotic dance stepping<br>up falling back laboring and resting<br>stepping up falling back laboring and<br>resting but I fear for the weather<br>succumbs she says and we're not going to<br>make it alone<br>do come in do come in for the well and<br>welcome in part of my life when I<br>actually get to sit in libraries or with<br>the Oxford English Dictionary online<br>looking at the deep detail of the<br>etymological dictionary and the<br>historical thesaurus one of the things I<br>love to do and think about is where the<br>roots are of our words and languages<br>indigenous people the world over do this<br>and know this and hold their languages<br>in ways where they can still see the<br>interweaving but we've often lost these<br>in English but I wanted to think today<br>with you about the well that is in<br>welcome and well in the etymological<br>dictionaries and in the historical<br>thesauruses referred<br>originally to a spring of water which<br>was supposed to have miraculous origins<br>or supernatural healing powers a spring<br>of water or perhaps of oil and in its<br>later youth maybe a mineral springs<br>thought to have medicinal qualities that<br>would set you up a bit like spa<br>treatments today or sea-bathing so<br>perhaps when we talk about welcome we're<br>not in the territory of the welcome<br>strategy of the Arturo and New Zealand<br>government but maybe we're in a domain<br>of magic and mystery and the more than<br>human world there are other etymological<br>roots to the world well well is also the<br>root of the old English word real from<br>which we took wealth or common wealth<br>but from which we also take will and you<br>can see that lovely list behind me of<br>words that its cognate with coming out<br>of the Germanic roots migrating across<br>Europe landing with Saxons and Vikings<br>and all kinds of other migrants and<br>Marauders and settlers and harvesters<br>over millennia giving us language that<br>we hold and use today in these very<br>words of welcome and wellness and<br>well-being wall<br>well Walla Walla wall<br>Val Val Val Varla vol and the word<br>welcome when we break it open when we<br>look back when it first started being<br>used in the 13th century when those<br>words were beginning to be recorded and<br>found in language a form which is<br>apparently according to that the old<br>english dictionary is now obsolete<br>well comment' one whose coming is<br>pleasing<br>or desirable an acceptable person or an<br>acceptable thing and when said of a<br>person acceptable as a visitor or as a<br>companion and I think that's very<br>interesting when we think about the<br>Riven politics of today that this aspect<br>of acceptability this aspect of<br>conditionality links into these origin<br>words of welcome and when we say all are<br>welcome somewhere underneath that as<br>Derrida has pointed out in his work on<br>hospitality were also imposing<br>conditions on what is acceptable to me<br>like the man on the plane next to me<br>today what's not acceptable is that<br>somebody might be using the luggage<br>locker that I wanted to use but of<br>course in ordinary parlance you're<br>welcome<br>actually changes to mean everyone's<br>welcome<br>you're welcome you're welcome it's just<br>a greeting a phrase Americanized but<br>there it is in its banality in its sheer<br>ordinary everyday nuf<br>everyone is welcome a universality that<br>it has this transition data--the the<br>acceptability and then it struck me that<br>I was speaking today in faggin area tada<br>in Wellington and whilst Fang gonorrhea<br>Tata thanks the heavy onee and to picky<br>I know doesn't mean the harbour of the<br>spike or the cloak which is what Google<br>Translate was giving me but actually the<br>harbor of Terra and I got to explore the<br>Ottawa and the ancestry but in looking<br>at Wellington of course we have a very<br>different far less mystical elemental<br>sense to the world to the word because<br>we have a warlord we have a general we<br>have a former Prime Minister we have the<br>inventor of boots with which to trample<br>on the watery earth and standing here in<br>Wellington I'm aware that we also are<br>very close to the feet of the new world<br>well being politics like those that are<br>coming together where two women also<br>lead the countries in Iceland and in<br>Scotland the poet David Wagoner said but<br>the place where you stand is called home<br>and you must treat it as a powerful<br>stranger and a powerful stranger maybe a<br>friend may indeed be acceptable and a<br>powerful stranger may need a little<br>caution a little wariness a little time<br>to get used to and understand and of<br>course this place where we stand today<br>is complicated it's unsettled its land<br>is unsettled and Riven but it's people<br>too are unsettled it's also a land that<br>is settled it's a land that is both<br>defatting and with refugees<br>it is reefer tling<br>as am i because my name is Alison and in<br>very unsettling ways to me I am a<br>recovering racist I was born with this<br>addiction because my ancestors were<br>white and the country I am from<br>reflecting every Imperial fight money<br>privilege and power come down the barrel<br>of a gun that wasn't just in history<br>it's still how this is done the work<br>which calls me loudly towards your skins<br>and eyes and tears is the work which is<br>intention to assuage those birthright<br>fears so do not idolize my actions do<br>not praise my words this bold do not<br>look at my intentions or the papers that<br>I hold the thoughts I have of charity<br>are just part of this addiction<br>inherited from a line that is a long and<br>bleached out fiction I do not have to<br>worry when my skin is in a room or on a<br>train or in a car or in the immigration<br>to I'll be given space and money and<br>more time because I'm white because my<br>ancestors were slave owners or slave<br>drivers and right but you my friends my<br>kindred will be skinned another way<br>played into diminishment through ever<br>greater punishments and all those cruel<br>admonishments the only proper meaning of<br>a white man's burden is that for all my<br>days commitment will be to our lling<br>labor on my deathbed in my dying i will<br>be a racist too but its shouldering the<br>burden that can leave to something new<br>not denial of what sticks to every tone<br>or shade or pore but the making of<br>relationships that brim with something<br>more something giving and forgiving of<br>the shame upon my skin something real<br>and raw and honest that can live with<br>history<br>at times our conversations may make our<br>skins dissolved and around us through<br>the laughter a new world may revolve<br>when the tears are all that bind us and<br>the skin gives way to bone and through<br>this work we love again and call one<br>that's one of my approaches to the place<br>where I stand with a powerful stranger<br>and I wrote that poem on the night that<br>the 45th president of the United States<br>of America was elected to power on a<br>flight from Wellington where he had just<br>heard the news from Mel's husband Tim<br>just before I landed in Melbourne<br>knowing I needed to do some work because<br>something had failed so that's one<br>approach to dealing with the powerful<br>stranger another of course there's<br>policies of well-being and don't get me<br>wrong I'm really excited about the shift<br>towards speaking of well-being rather<br>than simply monetary policy or economic<br>contribution with regard to refugee<br>resettlement or actually any form of<br>activity that might be taking place<br>within the realm of politics and the<br>public anything that might actually mean<br>we get to live in a healthy society<br>together in Scotland we are told that<br>the strategy for the country is that we<br>might live well and flourish really<br>taking on the motto of my home city of<br>Glasgow which is let glasgow flourish<br>into a national strategy and the<br>question then for all the strategies in<br>the country is how might we do this<br>together through the organs of<br>governments and civil society in such a<br>way that all might flourish one of my<br>tasks within civil society life in<br>Scotland is to chair the new Scots<br>integration strategy for the Scottish<br>government the refugee Council and also<br>for Koslow which is the umbrella<br>organization for the<br>collaborative and then bringing together<br>many other organizations like the Red<br>Cross like the health boards the<br>education boards the language boards any<br>board you can get a Monopoly board would<br>also do we bring it around the table and<br>look at it in with relation to the new<br>Scots integration strategy the<br>strategies are really interesting<br>strategy and that we believe if you're<br>the first one in the world to have been<br>written with an eye on integration of<br>refugees and when we did the work to<br>actually write the Refugee integration<br>strategy we worked with refugees and<br>former refugees so in the UK we often<br>don't talk about refugee background we<br>often do talk about refugees because<br>that is a prized status from the<br>majority who have been asylum seekers<br>but everybody knows that these labels<br>are troubled and troubling and difficult<br>and aren't all that appropriate and can<br>be very essential izing so we asked<br>people have refugee background what they<br>wanted to be called and they said we<br>want to be called new scots we want to<br>be called new scots and we don't mind<br>being new scots for a long time so as<br>someone who's been a new Scot now for 24<br>years<br>in fact so longer than i've been a new<br>anything else I then get to share that<br>label new scots with those who may have<br>come and sought sanctuary in my country<br>so this was a really interesting<br>approach to integration in that it's a<br>rights-based approach it's rooted in the<br>human rights declaration and every<br>strand of the policy starts with a<br>statement from the Universal Declaration<br>of Human Rights the right to housing the<br>right for education the right to speak<br>and nurture your mother tongue the right<br>to live with a with our way of<br>sustaining your heritage and culture and<br>in a community the right to claim asylum<br>the right to protection the right to<br>employment each one of the strands<br>starts from a rights based approach and<br>then develops into an understanding of<br>integration from day one so in England<br>and Wales the strategy is integration<br>from when you receive your refugee<br>status<br>and that can take a year it can take 5<br>years it can take 10 years I have known<br>it take 22 years during which time you<br>have no right to work and you have<br>whilst you are making your claim the<br>right to live on 37 pounds 60 a week no<br>right to work 37 pounds 6 feet a week<br>and that money is given to you on an ax<br>on a card and you have to spend it at<br>certain large supermarket chains which<br>may well be a long bus ride away from<br>where you have been relocated so the new<br>scotts integration strategy takes seven<br>core areas as vital and these again have<br>been identified through a way of looking<br>at what it is that new Scots believe<br>will make them well will give them away<br>not just a feeling welcomed not just of<br>getting over that threshold into a<br>country and having protection but<br>actually being able to live in ways that<br>mean that they can flourish - so it's<br>not an either/or it's not the Scots will<br>flourish and we really need to just do<br>what is good for those already here but<br>actually very much an integration<br>strategy and it's understood as<br>multilateral so the important point<br>about this is that everyone has the task<br>of integration upon them everyone if you<br>like is unsettling and resettling and<br>having to think through what that means<br>together make a new society<br>interestingly when we looked at the the<br>the many people who submitted their<br>information into the construction of the<br>refugee integration strategy 96 offense<br>had the most important thing to them was<br>that they were able to honour their<br>culture where they'd come from their<br>cultural heritage and that they were<br>able to navigate into the new languages<br>that they would have to learn oh that<br>others would learn those languages<br>alongside them and so within our and<br>equivalent of sponsorship programs that<br>you have where think with the Red Cross<br>and over here we have programs of<br>sharing languages and that when when<br>somebody might go shopping with a family<br>then they will be learning that this<br>might be what we call oil but this might<br>be what another family calls a tune so<br>that there's a mutual bit of language<br>sharing going on because it's a powerful<br>stranger language it's the site of<br>distrust and mistrust and<br>misunderstanding<br>it's a place where fear can be raised<br>and so there's work going on in our<br>language integration strategies for<br>everyone to feel a little bit more<br>comfortable around the language so she<br>can tell I feel quite positive about our<br>well-being strategy and about our new<br>Scotts integration strategy and that's<br>good because it's my job to make it<br>happen but I'm also as a scholar wanting<br>to bring a note of caution to the work<br>we're doing around well-being because I<br>do think we need vigilance particularly<br>coming from the arts and humanities and<br>philosophy disciplines but look at what<br>might be excluded or who might be<br>excluded in the making of our policies<br>about well-being<br>who is well-being for who is welcome for<br>and it's right that we listen hard when<br>people say but what about our own and<br>that we acknowledge the failures that<br>have occurred in societies for many<br>years where certainly we within the city<br>of Glasgow with the worst death<br>privations statistics and some of the<br>worst health statistics in the whole of<br>Europe that we say if we are going to<br>offer a good welcome and do resettlement<br>and reintegration well for a group of<br>people who are arriving surely this is<br>an opportunity for these ways of caring<br>for people to be how we learn to undo<br>the ills of the past and create a<br>society where all are well that this is<br>not a either/or it's not you get a half<br>and I don't it's not you get health care<br>and I don't it's not you get luggage<br>space and I don't because there was no<br>one who's back who wasn't on that plane<br>it's about the creative act of making<br>room um one of the wonderful things that<br>I've seen happening in theological<br>studies recently is the understanding of<br>creation as a form of making room making<br>room and the Christian theology<br>illogical tradition was the making room<br>that was the withdrawal to give space<br>for a Sabbath in which others could do<br>the making themselves or as one<br>wonderful theologian says it's like the<br>kind faced lady on the subway who moves<br>her bag so you can take a seat creative<br>acts of making room a bit like those<br>Knicks of ease that give you a way of<br>laboring and resting so I believe that<br>vigilance is needed and I believe<br>there's a danger within our well-being<br>strategies and this is true for the TED<br>talk that our First Minister gave on the<br>well-being and GDP for Scotland as I<br>think it is for your well-being policies<br>here in Aotearoa New Zealand the<br>emphasis on kindness and compassion is<br>vital and it is not sufficient because<br>it is no substitute for justice and<br>structural change<br>George McLeod a theologian working in<br>the 1930s in between the wars said when<br>you give of your time or your money or<br>your effort or your energy 50% of that<br>should be to the immediate need to the<br>people I need on the streets so the<br>people in need because of humanitarian<br>assistance and give it without question<br>because you are not that person the<br>other 50% why is this happening what can<br>you do politically and in terms of<br>structures to effect a change and that<br>work is often rather like the committed<br>people who sit around a table for two<br>hours on a regular basis giving of their<br>time voluntarily to the new Scots<br>integration strategy to think<br>hard about how we change structures and<br>it's often really boring unsexy<br>uncharitable work but it changes things<br>for an awful lot of people when we get<br>it right one change of law for one young<br>girl who was to be deported from the UK<br>under the European Convention the Dublin<br>agreement to a one change of that and<br>favor for people who were unaccompanied<br>minors were saved from deportation we<br>may not know about it it may be hidden<br>in those codes but it's incredibly<br>important so I think there's an ethical<br>valence that we need to bring to<br>questions of compassion and well-being<br>we need to be aware that it's compassion<br>and well-being and kindness and and keep<br>asking the question for whom because if<br>the for whom is for Refugees at the<br>expense of those who are in situations<br>of structural inequality prob and the<br>violence of poverty in our own societies<br>then that is not wellbeing and that is<br>not well come that is not acceptable<br>that is not companionship the root word<br>of companionship being those with whom<br>we break our bread companion and I think<br>we can learn a lot from feminists and<br>decolonial or even queer queer critics<br>about justice and cultural change beyond<br>kindness and beyond charity and the<br>uncomfortable work that the majority of<br>us benefiting from the structural<br>violence as in society will need to do<br>to move us into a place where well-being<br>we often ask the question and I<br>certainly have done this the charitable<br>question how can we help what can we do<br>and in my time here within Arturo New<br>Zealand I've seen an awful lot of<br>completely mind-blowing ly wonderful<br>projects done by communities and<br>different people the giving of vast<br>amounts of clothing and children's toys<br>of time and energy of food banks and of<br>volunteering to the point that it's<br>almost too much it's almost suffocating<br>and I've seen the same in my own context<br>where we worked out we had for everyone<br>resettled Syrian refugee we had five<br>volunteers all terrifyingly like my<br>mother and really one is quite enough<br>Padre go to Mercedes of questions like<br>how can we help you say is drawing on<br>fears eggs and the man asking boat about<br>motorcycle maintenance you faith it's<br>not a good question how can I help<br>unasked-for question ask better<br>questions lila watson the grey<br>aboriginal activist said if you've come<br>here to help you're wasting your time<br>but if you've come here because you<br>believe for your liberation your freedom<br>from structural violence is tied up with<br>mine is bound up with my struggle then<br>we can work together and that it's where<br>i have seen time and again communities<br>living in poverty who are host<br>communities coming together with refugee<br>resettlement and improving everything<br>tower blocks that were scheduled for<br>demolition in glasgow are now thriving<br>because the migrant communities have got<br>together with the local communities and<br>the mold is gone and there are gardens<br>and there are drying greens and there<br>are clay parks because people didn't say<br>why have you got one and I haven't<br>people said if we work together there<br>are twice for many of us to actually<br>that's a word for this kind of<br>philosophizing that I'm doing that comes<br>from thinkers like Laurel and Bello and<br>also Sara asked Ned<br>Lauren Belen has a book called cruel<br>optimism and she basically says that we<br>need to be careful about the<br>relationship of attachment we have to<br>compromise specific conditions of<br>possibility<br>whose realisation is it's discovered to<br>be either impossible sheer fantasy or<br>two possible and toxic she says this is<br>often true about um campaigns around<br>dieting which will say if you do with<br>everything or work and you will have<br>this particular figure but actually it's<br>cool optimism because you won't get<br>there that way and she really asks us to<br>be careful too of the positions we<br>inhabit not to be unduly optimistic to<br>have a lot of pragmatism like I've found<br>today in my colleague Jonathan and that<br>I found as an activist is vital to the<br>work we do so that what we imagine to be<br>the perfect life the flourishing life<br>the good life that we remember that for<br>many that may actually be a bad life and<br>every time someone takes face to me make<br>sure you do a bit of self-care just a<br>wee glass of wine put your feet up have<br>a spa I'm reminded of the conditions of<br>inequality that will reign at rest on<br>the labor the labouring that goes on in<br>vineyards that is cruel and unjust under<br>which I might be able to enjoy something<br>that has come a very long way and is<br>trashing the planet another approach to<br>well-being is the you know the European<br>approach the European approach to<br>welcome the European directive on<br>welcome and well-being is I believe<br>particularly permitted pernicious at<br>this moment frontex police's the borders<br>of Europe and we have even more strict<br>stringent controls than the UK and this<br>is it so in 2003 our boat sank off the<br>coast of land producer<br>and around we believe 398 people the<br>majority of them eretrians lost their<br>lives in those coffins or the bodies of<br>those who lost their lives they were<br>posthumously granted refugee status had<br>they come alive they would have had<br>years to go through a labyrinthine<br>system like the one I described to you<br>of seeking asylum and in one of those<br>coffins is a member of my own family my<br>far know this is what has been called by<br>a coelom Bembe the great post-colonial<br>scholar necro politics and what I also<br>call macro ethics because there is an<br>ethical system that justifies this it's<br>the one I was next to on the plane today<br>in order that I might have the room I<br>believe is due to me you should not have<br>that room you should not be on this<br>plane you should not have the right to<br>freedom of movement within a country<br>necro ethics is what has been described<br>in my country as the epic of the garden<br>fork<br>I'm described as children playing in a<br>garden and they kick a ball over the<br>fence and when that ball goes over the<br>fence into their neighbor's garden the<br>neighbor has a choice the neighbor can<br>either go round with the football and<br>maybe a cup of tea and some lollies and<br>join in or the neighbor can put a fork<br>through the football and complain that<br>their roses have been bashed that's<br>necro ethics a politics of death and<br>ethics of death a killing of joy in a<br>very particular and quite pernicious way<br>and one which is easily exacerbated when<br>I visited the Cal I can't say Jonathan<br>mentioned it was at the time when the<br>daffodils were blooming<br>for the first time the daffodils did not<br>bring me cheerfulness they're nodding<br>yellow heads incongruent stubborn<br>sunshine at the wrong end of winter it<br>was wartime the earth struggles against<br>the feed corn the plowed fields may or<br>may not bring harvest on the clifftops<br>there are old gun emplacements looking<br>across the estuary towards the nuclear<br>power plants around the concrete bases<br>the same jaundiced flowers springs<br>heralds or signs of I fear I do not know<br>whether to fight or to flee I do not<br>know if the east wind will spread the<br>pollen or freeze away the first signs of<br>life on the borders of Europe they are<br>loading people into cages and sending<br>them back to the bombs and on the<br>borders of this field there are<br>daffodils nodding away as the bodies<br>wash again out to sea so now that you<br>are all suitably depressed<br>let's look at some of the joyful ways in<br>which we can enact welcome in a way that<br>is well for all that sense of all as<br>well as a source that seems to be<br>bubbling over with joy so welcome to<br>refugee if you come from Glasgow you're<br>called a ouija a Glaswegian is a ouija<br>and refugee just say that everyone's a<br>refugee a refugee is a person who upon<br>arrival in Glasgow is embraced by either<br>by birth or by arrival by train or boat<br>or plane or however is embraced by the<br>people of the city a person considered<br>to be local<br>see also glass region we're off there<br>somewhere it says in Scots and I'm<br>wearing the refuge with the refugee<br>response here one of the things refugee<br>has done as well as collecting up the<br>things that people need like children's<br>buggies or<br>sanitary protection for young girls I've<br>invite the locals to write letters of<br>welcome to those who are arriving<br>letters furlough calls as it's known and<br>here are some of the wonderful examples<br>and there are hundreds of these that are<br>given to people in welcome packs when<br>they arrive in the city and they're<br>lovely full of tips about how to make<br>yourself feel good like you'll want to<br>go to the parks but maybe not when it's<br>raining you can go to the city centre<br>for shopping and you can go to them the<br>museum to visit because it's free<br>and you'll want to go to the Lidl<br>supermarket because it's really cheap<br>it's a very big city but the people are<br>very good the simple language of welcome<br>from young children and here are two of<br>the people leading from other refugee<br>integration work to refugee ambassadors<br>for the Scottish Refugee Council and a<br>unesco program leading the welcome<br>events that the Scottish Refugee Council<br>does refugee led welcome because of<br>course the majority of refugee hosting<br>worldwide is done by refugees and by<br>other migrant groups and any of us who<br>are part of a host community that's<br>removed from that migrant experience are<br>kidding ourselves if we think we're<br>really putting ourselves out or know how<br>to do it at all<br>the majority of the faux furs in the<br>rooms certainly of refugees that I know<br>are inhabited by new arrivals waiting to<br>get safety and being fine posted there's<br>another sense of the killjoy that Sarah<br>Ahmed work talks about she talks about<br>this aspect of critical consciousness<br>this punctuating of notions even such as<br>kindness or well-being with a little bit<br>of a critical edge as being vital to<br>opening out our lives to making more<br>room for life so maybe making ourselves<br>a little uncomfortable so that there's a<br>new possibility a different chance it<br>might mean we have to be create<br>ourselves in the language of C mauvais<br>and she says if ethics is to preserve<br>the freedom to disagree with things the<br>freedom that is also the rights of the<br>man you sat next to me on the plane<br>today the right of free speech to say<br>these things and work these things<br>through then we have to understand that<br>there is good that can come from the<br>encounters and that that too was a gift<br>if only for me to operates my killjoy<br>critique on today so a smurf save maybe<br>we need to rewrite history and the<br>history of happiness the history of what<br>we mean by well-being not from the<br>perspective of middle-class bourgeois<br>people like myself who sit on boards and<br>make decisions as far too many of us do<br>and in lecture theatres and boards like<br>this where we are often salaried to make<br>those decisions but from the point of<br>view of what Sara asked bird calls the<br>wretch because then then those material<br>conditions inform a decision-making and<br>we can understand what well-being might<br>look like when well-being is a source of<br>resilience of hope but also a source of<br>a demand for justice and that might as<br>strangers from our more familiar notions<br>of well-being in a rather more gentle<br>state in my own work around this I've<br>recently written a very short book and<br>which was great fun to write because it<br>was a short book I really haven't got<br>time to write long books any longer and<br>I think we're in an age where we need to<br>write pamphlets I think the urgency is<br>certainly in my own country as the age<br>mean we need things that come through<br>quickly where we can have a more urgent<br>tone and we're in peacetime once again<br>we can go back and reflect and spend<br>longer with our books and I really<br>wanted to ask myself the question or to<br>ethnographically of what happens after<br>acceptable people have been welcomed not<br>just to look at the resettlement<br>strategies and the welcomed strategies<br>but actually what's the deep difficult<br>work we do after the welcome what does<br>it look like to<br>really unsettle ourselves and resettle<br>ourselves and make a society in you<br>what does integration mean in the<br>understanding from human integral<br>development that means we're constantly<br>changing and shaping and developing<br>ourselves that we might be having to do<br>this as a difficult therapeutic act<br>where each fragment of ourselves is<br>given one story at a time one piece at a<br>time one little challenge around bags in<br>lockers at a time what does it mean to<br>ask the question of how people live when<br>it's unacceptable and how do we then<br>make a new world that we might make well<br>so decolonizing multilingualism that for<br>me was a way of asking this question and<br>I wanted to ask this by really<br>acknowledging that I am someone who is<br>very fluent in many languages all<br>colonial languages all which gave me a<br>great deal of well-being and a great<br>deal of opportunity to travel and<br>because Napolitan and for people to you<br>know adulate my great ability in German<br>and French because that was the<br>education policy of the land the on tone<br>cordial and the desire of bourgeois<br>people to go on holiday to the South of<br>France and of course now the languages I<br>need are tickly Nia and Tagalog and<br>Arabic and gah and Shona those are the<br>languages I need to speak I need to<br>speak the languages of welcome in my own<br>neighborhood I need to learn and am<br>beginning to learn today Omari because<br>you lovely people keep asking me back so<br>in the book I tell a number of stories<br>and one of them is about learning today<br>Amari and the way in which that be<br>settled and unsettled and remade me in<br>many ways which were both beautiful and<br>terrifyingly unsettling for who I am and<br>who I come from but I also wrote two<br>sections about to the body about what<br>happens to the body when you are in so<br>much pain that language is stripped from<br>you and that you may be situated<br>alongside or in those positions of<br>people who have experienced torture in<br>the way Sara<br>Ahmed speaks self<br>the story of putting myself in the hands<br>of a healer who was actually my taxi<br>driver and I thought that was all he was<br>when I was working in Ghana but actually<br>he was a very skilled healer and when I<br>taught all three anterior ligaments in<br>my ankle and couldn't walk I told them<br>again I've done this several times<br>there's a weakness there then as well as<br>saying he would be able to drive me<br>around more regularly in order for me to<br>do the work I was doing which was irony<br>of ironies leading a dance production<br>for six weeks he would also be able to<br>heal me and he said but it will be pain<br>full and over the course of three weeks<br>he subjected me to deep tissue massage<br>on precisely the point where I had been<br>injured the medical journals will say<br>that if pain allows then after a week<br>this will reduce the swelling and you<br>can probably stand and move a lot more<br>quickly the pain was excruciating<br>the people sang in my room rather as I<br>believe might happen in birthing rituals<br>in parts of the world to help my breath<br>but within three weeks I was mobile<br>again I could dance gently and gingerly<br>again and something happened between us<br>in that relationship of power reversal<br>of myself putting myself in the hands of<br>a healer who would never normally be<br>able to practice on someone like myself<br>and he became the leader the expert and<br>I became someone from whom he could also<br>learn because for the first time he was<br>watching what happened when blood throw<br>flows because he could see it through<br>white skin for the first time and had<br>never been able to see what a ginormous<br>swollen bruised look like before as it<br>goes through the traffic lights the<br>other area that I wanted to look at was<br>what happened within my own family as I<br>engaged in decolonizing<br>if you like my heart and so a number of<br>years ago and it's a very long story<br>and a young girl turned up on our<br>doorstep over ten years ago on<br>International Women's Day a young<br>accompanied miner from Eritrea and she<br>was destitute and homeless and she was<br>in asylum seeker and she came to live<br>with us and within 48 hours we realized<br>that we had a daughter and over many<br>years through many different ways of<br>trying to live her life and with her and<br>alongside her we were able to return to<br>Khartoum to where the third that the<br>city where her family were housed in a<br>third country so we met them again for<br>the first time and so I was very nervous<br>of course because we had very little<br>language in common and I wanted to think<br>about what it meant to be with your<br>daughter who doesn't speak her mother<br>tongue in order to meet her mother whose<br>tongue she speaks a young man met us<br>with a small minibus at the airport when<br>I first knew him he had a rickshaw now<br>he's been here long enough to have a van<br>said my daughter my body is always<br>already everybody's property and the<br>minibus the women who matters are<br>holding my arms my knee my face patting<br>me repeatedly my skin belongs to their<br>care now we do not share many words and<br>so touch and smiles and nods are going<br>to bind us through the time we are<br>spending physically together and this<br>isn't going to be a time when personal<br>space is maintained and organized the<br>way it is back home we are going to be<br>living in close quarters and on top of<br>each other<br>by any measure along the landing and<br>into the apartment block is a trail of<br>red rose petals and tiny tea light<br>candles leading into a room with one<br>huge bed for all of us at the end of the<br>line of lights and petals are the world<br>words spelled out in rose petals too<br>well come travel weary as we are not<br>least from using Airlines and operators<br>which fly into majority refugee hosting<br>contexts and standing in queues for visa<br>forms and visas and complying with<br>varieties of copycat bureaucratic<br>processes designed to mimic Western ways<br>it will still be 4 a.m. before the<br>joyous celebrations of arrival and and<br>we can fall into bed if we enter the<br>apartment the camera phones are already<br>recording the moment the endless kissing<br>of cheeks and holding of arms shoulders<br>her cheeks and repeated repeated<br>repeated greetings of peace how are you<br>Salaam Salaam peace how are you Salaam<br>peace how are you and then that's it for<br>English for two weeks I'm over the<br>threshold and the languages are only<br>ticky Mia and to be LAN and it's<br>beautiful the petals the scarves<br>fluttering the colour is telling of who<br>we are with and where they belong the<br>candle light bringing us to a place as a<br>home well coming I want to give you a<br>couple more examples of and the things<br>that have gone on within the hosting<br>that have been done in our community and<br>through the work we've been doing in<br>Glasgow together collectively and from<br>the University so first of all just to<br>show you this lovely slide of the Red<br>Road flats which are no more the Red<br>Road flats would were demolished<br>recently but we be through one of the<br>places where the majority of asylum<br>seekers and refugees were housed in the<br>city and the City Council wanted to blow<br>them up in a great celebration for the<br>start of the Commonwealth Games there<br>was a huge outcry because people felt<br>that blowing these terrible houses up<br>which were a scene of damp and dreadful<br>health indicators was just not fair to<br>the life that had been lived there the<br>first place of factory a place where a<br>child was born the place where the songs<br>and lullabies would be sung and so<br>instead we were invited by the community<br>to come and engage in a really<br>interesting art project one of the<br>things that you see outside Glasgow<br>tenement flats are drying greens with<br>great bed sheets drying together and<br>women and man<br>coming together to hang the washing out<br>there and chat and talk so in the<br>schools the children died bedsheets<br>different colors and then safe den the<br>demolition company hung them up to see<br>what they look like on the flats after<br>they've taken out the asbestos ready for<br>demolition and they look like prayer<br>flags from Tibet and then they recorded<br>phones from the communities that live<br>there lullabies that they sung to the<br>children or other songs and left lullaby<br>like like you cannot shove your granny<br>off a bus and they played them after<br>recording them through the windows of<br>what if if you look at it very closely<br>clearly a giant loudspeaker or ghetto<br>blaster to the city and then acquire<br>came together to do and I never thought<br>I would say these words in my academic<br>career Mongolian throat singing and they<br>were taught to do Mongolian throat<br>singing to find in their stomachs a<br>sound that they associated with the<br>lives they lived in those flats and to<br>bring them together just into a sound<br>that was polyphony and harmony all at<br>once and under a very skilled conductor<br>to think goodbye to the flats and to go<br>through lament into joy to do in funk<br>that killjoy that Sarah Ahmed and Lauren<br>Berlin talk about to lament it but also<br>to celebrate the lives that had been<br>lived there through the work we've been<br>doing this refugee led and migrant lad<br>we managed to get the peace symbols the<br>civic institutions to not just pretend<br>they have a diversity strategy and count<br>the number of faces of people from<br>different backgrounds they think have<br>come over the threshold in order to keep<br>their public money but to actually<br>reorganize and reorder their galleries<br>yes to repatriate art that we took but<br>also to allow artists in and the Glasgow<br>who are from the Diaspora to make art<br>out of artifacts that are in the<br>galleries so this is a beautiful can<br>take off wedding dress made by the same<br>art<br>who made my beautiful jacket which is<br>indeed a research output nod intuited<br>row and the light box made by taneema<br>Mousawi and tuwana Fatali that is a long<br>praised poem to the land of ecology of<br>Zimbabwe now part of the permanent<br>collection in the most visited Museum in<br>the whole of Scotland we let gather<br>teach-back<br>we let those in Gaza tell us as part of<br>the work they were doing with us wanting<br>to come for refuge but not being allowed<br>tell us what refuge look like for them<br>and to put on a really surprising<br>display of joy that would counter the<br>mainstream media that suggests that all<br>is only devastation and bombing and we<br>ask the Royal Society of Edinburgh not<br>just a partner with a country in the<br>global South particularly in Africa for<br>the first time and it's three hundred<br>year history since the Enlightenment but<br>to consider drawing pictures of the<br>refugee background scholars that had<br>recently been elected as fellows to the<br>Royal Academy through a particular<br>scheme we did with our scholars at risk<br>event and this will be really pertinent<br>to the event going on I know a victim ro<br>and this is a portrait of Deborah kmb a<br>barrister from dr congo it is the first<br>time a black woman has been displayed on<br>the walls of the Royal Society of<br>Edinburgh it was unveiled by the head of<br>the art school and it am now hangs in<br>the permanent collection of the Royal<br>Society of Edinburgh as part of the<br>Edinburgh Festival and next to that is<br>my colleague Elana<br>standing next to the Human Rights<br>Commissioner for and the United Nations<br>the High Commissioner the dignity and<br>the pride that comes when a talented<br>portrait artist Ian Campbell sits down<br>with people and saves to them the most<br>painted person in the world is the Queen<br>let's put your portrait on the walls of<br>so I'm coming to the end of what I want<br>to say to you and I really want to say<br>that the epic story that we're living<br>through again it's not unprecedented<br>there are no more numbers of refugees<br>and they really have been at other times<br>of history and if you're told it's<br>unprecedented it's by organizations that<br>know that that's one way to just make<br>sure they can keep doing humanitarian<br>aid work or one way that they can keep<br>frightening you about refugees but it is<br>a story of movement and a visit or a<br>time where fear is reaching very high<br>levels again and as a result it's also a<br>story of resistance and well-being that<br>goes on beyond welcome and I think those<br>are all to be well we maybe need to<br>learn from what exiles do and what<br>exiles do and we know this from<br>theologians and we know this from health<br>professionals we know this from<br>educators and we know this from<br>researchers and we know this from<br>artists what exiles do if they grieve<br>they lament they make public their<br>expressions of pain and without apology<br>they are honest about their sadness they<br>ridicule established structures of power<br>and they don't and please don't ask<br>people to do this they don't spend all<br>their time being grateful it is a right<br>to seek asylum they're careful about<br>being too cozy with Empire and they're<br>careful about empires language they<br>tackle the dominant and failing script<br>with words of their own and they<br>remember the elements the things of the<br>land that are universal that bind us all<br>the old ways the old names the odd ways<br>the odd names like well and wall and<br>wall and wallah<br>and all those roots that might tell us<br>something about what we mean when we say<br>well being the odd things the quirky<br>things<br>the things that are the stock trade of<br>artists and those with prophetic<br>imaginations in order to reimagine the<br>future and it's in this way that I<br>believe well-being of integration is<br>hospitality it's so much more than<br>welcoming people with the plastic toys<br>that you don't want anymore<br>it's costly and if it doesn't change us<br>if it's not a bit uncomfortable if we<br>don't have to make a bit more room in<br>the overhead Locker then it isn't<br>welcome and it isn't hospitality and<br>it's not and it's already breaking that<br>taboo which is one of the deepest we<br>have about failing to offer hospitality<br>to the stranger and this is what I've<br>come to understand as what's at the root<br>of menarche Tanger we are well because<br>you have come you bring wellness to us<br>this with your gifts because we will<br>have to reimagine what happiness means<br>when we have to move our bags in an<br>overhead Locker and that is why from the<br>well the source the water we also greet<br>people with water every time I land in a<br>crowd or Khartoum the first thing I get<br>is one of these and one day it won't be<br>in a plastic bottle greetings with water<br>baptism the thief's paying the throwing<br>of bodies into the river the things I've<br>experienced in Teodoro when to cleanse<br>me of the heaviness i might carry I have<br>tie to have been thrown into a river<br>from the mountains in May thankfully I<br>swim off the coast of Iona in Scotland<br>so I know how quickly you can go blue in<br>that water well nurse not just the<br>wellness of well-being but the Wellness<br>of the well the water those mystical<br>qualities again so hospitality I believe<br>is for our well-being of remaking a<br>culture as reciprocity<br>is integral to life and its hue if I<br>both a human and a spiritual taboo to<br>break it if you break it you break<br>everything the bonds that bind us so<br>there is a well in well-being depending<br>on water on its ab and its flow its<br>life-sustaining and life-giving<br>qualities we commit ourselves to<br>learning about it because that way as<br>Elaine's scary save if we know about<br>well-being and its deep ways and its<br>critical ways we will know where to<br>stand when something beautiful happens<br>like when a comet makes its sweep across<br>we're obedient to other minds other<br>Seamus Heaney said the way we are living<br>you the interpreter asked Fiona the test<br>two surgeons arrived au the interpreter<br>no I laughs I'm the mum you're too young<br>quick as a flash and not a blink blink<br>of hesitation and I'm so grateful and<br>not for the compliment but for the lack<br>of a flinch they have the widest of<br>smiles and I am in a European minority<br>of one two three Africans and for once<br>it's a relief the nurse tells me to go<br>off for a walk if I like I go into town<br>High Street is the usual door and<br>forgotten us straining at hope that it<br>has been since I first arrived in the<br>city a few swanky buildings a tourist<br>info precinct around the cathedral but<br>it's this mural of st. Mungo with his<br>kindly faith and Robin that brings me<br>warmth and speaks of the refuge I too<br>feel at times in the complicated<br>flourishing suffering city of Glasgow<br>today is the autumn equinox it's the day<br>when the life of summer gives way to the<br>light of the winter to come the day when<br>day and night are in equal measure from<br>the hospital ward the skies to the east<br>as dawn broke filled me up blue gleaming<br>gray<br>today if the first time I've ever been<br>to the Necropolis though I wander up<br>among the urns and angels under the<br>spire for Cathedral and read buried<br>Rouen trees guardians of life and death<br>they say that Rouen crosses were placed<br>on the lintels of houses in the pastor's<br>protection that it was from the Rowan<br>tree that the first

house after the rape led<br>today is the International Day for peace<br>and my heart yearns for the easing of<br>border controls which mean that those<br>who should be here in my place are not<br>being mistaken for an interpreter and<br>might have been granted a visitor visa<br>but this is the time of reality of the<br>hostile environment and war which<br>relentlessly divides families friends<br>and loved ones and does so most acutely<br>when you stand on the thresholds of life<br>and death so we make the best of it<br>people are kind and everyone is<br>promising joy I've learned over the<br>years of living this way to feel little<br>at times by way of emotion there's a<br>tight there is a protection like a<br>little like the Robbins shots sharp song<br>which draws my feelings into a tight<br>curl and fits them into a shell I know<br>that hope means being quiet in this<br>small dark solitary place because a baby<br>will be born and it's life too will<br>wither like the trees turning on the<br>branches of the Rowan perhaps today<br>perhaps after threescore years and turn<br>there is nothing certain in life except<br>death taxes and for this generation<br>hostile border controls many names many<br>names and many roles are needed in the<br>waging and keeping of peace for the<br>sustaining of hospitality in a hospital<br>over the long term and beyond the<br>welcome all day I have been an<br>interpreter of the symbols of peace<br>around this hospital in my home city the<br>city of my own refuge and sheltering of<br>my mothering and fostering here if the<br>bird that never flew the tree that never<br>grew the bell that never rang the fish<br>there never swam we're ready<br>faithfulness the day have been long and<br>the surgeons are working late time<br>passes<br>pass us and then there is a miracle in<br>my arms and what are you going to be<br>called asks the kind faith nurse I bye<br>grandma<br>the words stumble out like life like<br>peace<br>enter the wild with care my love and<br>speak the things you see then your<br>name's taken root and thrive and grow<br>and even as you travel far from heaven<br>crying and river may you like the little<br>Fisher said the stream aligned with<br>glitter may you enter now assaulter<br>without falter into water look to the<br>sky with care my love and speak the<br>things you see lend your names taken<br>root and thrive and grow and even eyes<br>your journey on past dying stars<br>exploding like the Kelvin one in flight<br>leave your little gifts light and in the<br>dead of night my darling find the<br>gleaming eyes swirling like the<br>literally meter sing your heart to old<br>walk through the world with care my love<br>and sing the things you see lettin your<br>name's take her roots and thrive and<br>roll as you stumble through mother<br>seeker and city and forests let the legs<br>become your course and laughter even<br>call you home professor Ellison thank<br>you for your presentation went about<br>refugee migrant it is a Western religion<br>the fundament of Western civilization is<br>based on Christianity but now we have<br>multiculturalism or in taking refugee to<br>give any background and refugee and<br>migrant we should have migrant for other<br>countries now the question is when there<br>is multi phase different religion<br>different belief when they stop<br>persecuting purchasing Christian is some<br>commonality because I believe in loving<br>God loving parents maintaining peace and<br>the country provide<br>space for refugee to fit in and so far<br>migrant come in the world and leave and<br>study but what happened if we don't aim<br>for conversion but in what understanding<br>to accommodate people that practice<br>Christianity love God in purity and in<br>many ways so what is the opinion thank<br>you yeah a great question um I think<br>understanding is a really important<br>element in the kinds of peacebuilding<br>that we need in order to make well and<br>flourishing societies but I don't think<br>he's I don't think understanding is<br>enough I think understanding is one of<br>the things we need but I think you can<br>understand a lot with your mind but<br>still engage in actions that are unkind<br>unjust and which won't enable the kinds<br>of societies that you're describing I<br>think it is right the one of the things<br>but only one of the things that it's<br>part of what might be a basis for you<br>claiming and the right to be recognized<br>as a refugee is religious persecution<br>from whatever religious background that<br>might be but I also think it's right<br>that there are other elements and<br>dimensions to that and they often come<br>into conflict with one another so there<br>are elements in some of the world<br>religions that do not recognize the<br>right to claim asylum and be recognized<br>as a refugee on the grounds of your<br>sexuality and that that means that in<br>the societies we're trying to build<br>we've got a really difficult job to do<br>and I do believe that some of what<br>you're working out in tricky ways here<br>in altero New Zealand with your<br>bicultural and you're bilingual<br>strategies and your understanding you're<br>a relatively new understanding or<br>revitalized understanding of what it<br>means to live under the treaty is one<br>thing that you have as a gift for the<br>world in understanding this that<br>actually tolerance understanding and<br>allowing people to live within the law<br>in ways which are<br>except it is important and acceptance<br>and understanding does not have to be<br>the same as full agreement and full<br>consensus and I think we often mix up<br>the two we think we all have to agree to<br>live together and we don't in fact we<br>know that from our own families and I<br>certainly know it from my family that<br>basically the people I love the most of<br>the people with whom I can have the most<br>profound disagreements oh my goodness do<br>I understand them you know I've done the<br>therapy course I've read the manuals I<br>know what my mother's childhood trauma<br>was and still still understanding<br>doesn't help me when she asks me why I<br>don't know where the butter knife is<br>kept at home and when I say so I think<br>there are other factors that we need<br>within the ways we live together a very<br>wise and psychotherapist and said to me<br>once we can't change anything without<br>humor and that if we can live with one<br>another in a way where we can make light<br>of some other things we do then we will<br>be able to live with one another and<br>that's particularly hard in the context<br>so we're talking about faith and<br>religious practice because we're so<br>easily offended we are so easily<br>offended I remember the life of Brian<br>coming out as a film when I was in my<br>teenagers and people were picketing<br>outside we are so easily offended and to<br>me what we need if we take offense<br>though easily we meant well forget that<br>um wait for the gods to come along who<br>is strong enough to take it because I<br>don't know about you but the different<br>gods that I've experimented with or<br>worshiped in my life they've got quite a<br>sense of humor I mean they must have<br>and I was just wondering it have you<br>come across the documentary Celia I'm<br>Celia Leslie the documentary made by men<br>de Milla no I haven't so it sounds like<br>I should<br>you sure do ships so it's just to say<br>and there there's a lovely young girl<br>she was 12 at the time so it's a few<br>years as in that sense um but I think<br>she had a Syrian granny<br>and so when Celia died who are really<br>good friends was neighbors with this<br>family and there's it's really beautiful<br>because it links them to a different<br>Syrians story and there's make<br>foundation.org and she sings this most<br>beautiful song so this X I'm just going<br>along with you know how we're blessed to<br>have the multi culture yeah so sort of<br>like links in Tibet what's mental health<br>and well-being which is well in our<br>budget yeah I've written it down don't<br>worry I'll give him a no it's great I<br>can put my pen down mental health<br>written from a Maori perspective so it's<br>called hearing voices or not museums and<br>so it's sort of saying you've got to<br>take things from a cultural perspective<br>so what happens is we have a lot of<br>psychiatrists come to New Zealand<br>because it's a shorter jump Lee so what<br>happens is they're coming with the<br>European might see it and they don't get<br>like someone like me I'm white ass I'm a<br> ha and that I grow up and put it<br>all up so it's normal for me to ask who<br>are your people where you from<br>yeah and to ask there of psychiatrists<br>from the UK they don't get us because<br>you know they might be working class<br>work their way up and it's like you're<br>sort of questioning God they were they<br>yeah um that's supposed to be quite<br>quite funny that you've raised that<br>because in the the car like two seven I<br>was looking at the work we've been doing<br>on mental health within my team<br>particularly looking at the way in which<br>we've been D creating and decolonizing<br>that mental health um mindset within<br>research and working with my colleague<br>particularly Ross white but also Roscoe<br>could assuage er from a mockery<br>University in Uganda and doing some work<br>with a dance company in Ghana to<br>really deconstruct the framework of<br>understanding of random control trials<br>and of research that's been done largely<br>on I think second year undergraduate<br>students in American universities which<br>is the basis for how we have learned to<br>do mental health and I'm looking at<br>Mariah there who's nodding away as well<br>but that just it doesn't tell you<br>anything and it's not helpful to us<br>for actually working across so a number<br>of different contexts and cultures for<br>the work we're doing and I think what<br>we've found if when we've worked<br>particularly from indigenous wisdom and<br>indigenous sayings and indigenous<br>knowledge that there is an enormous<br>wealth of with some embedded<br>particularly in Proverbs that are used<br>to enable people to stay well and to<br>facilitate their own well-being and that<br>the vast majority of the world's<br>population can't afford to see or visit<br>somebody for counseling and even if the<br>vast majority of the world's population<br>could what would be imposed on them<br>would not necessarily be something that<br>was of any value to anyone other than<br>second year undergraduate student I'm<br>exaggerating for effect where you get<br>the point<br>so um at some point I think that lecture<br>will be online and where we've we've<br>done a couple of projects I can also we<br>can trade we can trade notes for that<br>yes Allison thank you for that<br>inspirational very moving talk lots of<br>resonances for me I come from a Scottish<br>father who left Glasgow in 1930 cuz he<br>thought it was the most appalling place<br>ever and then met my mother who was a<br>Jewish German refugee in Cairo and a<br>mother who lived in Palestine and hate<br>it with a passion what was happening to<br>the Palestinians but I've got two very<br>simple questions one is what did you say<br>to the man with the overhead Locker<br>instant because I can think this is what<br>I'd have said and I know actually what<br>I've done I've gone I'm not gonna say<br>anything's is too embarrassing as a good<br>as a good Brit but I'm interesting about<br>what you said to him and the second<br>thing is what if you had a magic wand<br>and could design a policy for the<br>European Union borders what would that<br>be because it's<br>I mean just like a swamp of how do you<br>how do you get there I don't know so to<br>Susan one simple question one what did I<br>say so what'd I say<br>would you mind if I moved past you I<br>would like to go to the toilet and<br>there's a bit of me that thinks I should<br>have challenged him but I think if I had<br>done my friends who were sitting behind<br>me who I'd been chatting to who were at<br>the Syrian refugee family I think I was<br>mindful of their sense of discomfort and<br>I've been in many many situations where<br>I have chosen to speak up but they've<br>been in many situations where I've<br>chosen not to because I'm trying to work<br>out because I'm unsure you know and that<br>I come from Yorkshire when in doubt do<br>note and there was doubt in my head but<br>there was also the sense of here that<br>though my phrase about you know the kind<br>faithful man on the subway makes room<br>and I thought all only thing about you<br>is saying you don't want to make room<br>for these people their belongings or<br>anything else so I'm going to ask you to<br>make room for me I'm going to ask you to<br>allow me to move past you so I can be<br>more comfortable and if you can do that<br>then we can start because we've got a<br>place I did wonder I mean given given<br>the tirade I was hearing coming from him<br>I did wonder whether he would actually<br>allow me to move past him and he did<br>moanin and grumble a bit but it did<br>happen and then when I sat down again he<br>took my seat belt lot hairs and so we<br>ended up with a moment where we had<br>humour and then we could we didn't get<br>into conversation but where was a moment<br>where we could begin that work so I<br>think a very subtle micro movements but<br>that that's what I said I said can I get<br>past you because I'd like to go to the<br>increasingly and following the<br>scholarship of a number of people but<br>also legal and scholars that I work with<br>I pretty much advocate for human beings<br>with good immunization programs or<br>treatment programs overseas freedom of<br>movement<br>I actually think borders of the problem<br>I think they're hugely expensive they<br>don't work they are they produce more<br>fear and what we see in the vast<br>majority of the parts of the world where<br>people can move across borders<br>relatively freely is that after the<br>initial moment of mass flight which<br>occasionally happens and therefore all<br>over the news serving on things that's<br>normal but isn't after that and after<br>it's a regular eyes then UNH they'll go<br>in and they build by camps and those<br>things can happen and it's contained<br>people move very quickly into one thing<br>to put this into normal life and to<br>establish normal life and that in the<br>majority of the world's populations<br>people just move across borders quite<br>freely and establish new places and new<br>settlements grow and develop and change<br>the people who were odd are those of us<br>in the West although there's a wonderful<br>meme map of the West going all over the<br>world at the moment the West is South<br>Africa and North America and this is the<br>West too so but in these places the rich<br>world the world that has exploited well<br>for its own benefit we're really scared<br>that people might come and take what<br>we've got so my my sense would be<br>freedom of movement within Europe is<br>working and it's working for refugees to<br>who arrive and then can get to the<br>country to claim asylum where their<br>families are it's difficult but it's<br>possible and that's a good thing for<br>everybody so my sense is let's just let<br>it happen I mean the other policy I<br>would have right now because it's not<br>going to happen anytime soon not in my<br>lifetime people are too scared and<br>there's too much money tied up with the<br>border politics and the border<br>infrastructures and a lot of people are<br>making a lot of money from corporations<br>like g4f and we shouldn't underestimate<br>that you want to know why we do this<br>follow the money but safe passage safe<br>passage you know we would not have the<br>deaths we've got if we were doing<br>refugee resettlement well and it's great<br>that you are over doubling the quota<br>here in in our town or New Zealand the<br>numbers we take are pitiful<br>the numbers of course that are crossing<br>into countries where<br>the border controls don't exist you know<br>the millions in Turkey and in Lebanon<br>and in Jordan and gander what can we say<br>I mean it is a it can only be a source<br>of shame and challenge to us so that<br>would be my policy safe passage<br>all the gates and the borders they're<br>all gone away The Economist has recently<br>done a report report on migrate or<br>global migration and they talked a lot<br>about the economic benefits our freedom<br>of movement and how you can um well they<br>predict that free bought like open<br>borders would double the global GDP how<br>comfortable do you feel using those<br>arguments because I'm guessing that they<br>also clash with certain beliefs that you<br>might hold about their old economy and<br>things like that so if they are the only<br>arguments that are used I'm very<br>uncomfortable but I'm not I'm also a<br>pragmatist you know we need to eat we<br>need to sleep we need to make money we<br>need to have good employment you know<br>there are many things we need so the<br>fact that I spin off from having what is<br>right might be that there is more real<br>wealth for all then I don't really have<br>a problem with it what I do have a<br>problem with is the use of arguments of<br>contribution that are made for why we<br>should take refugees in I think those<br>are they are absolutely not in the<br>spirit of the United Nations Convention<br>which is you have a right if you if you<br>are persecuted you have a right to seek<br>asylum full stop not if you're<br>persecuted and you come from a<br>particular group that have a high human<br>capital index and you may have already<br>gone through higher education so<br>therefore we'll take you in and that is<br>a lot of the time many of the Syrian<br>refugees and one of the ways in which<br>some of the European policies have<br>worked to say we'll take the Syrians but<br>we won't take the air<br>because higher education in Eritrea<br>closed completely in 2003 so therefore<br>we'll have to put a lot more time and<br>effort into educating people<br>that's pernicious that's unjust no but<br>if it's about saying what has also<br>happened in a number of countries like<br>Germany where a million people were<br>resettled and I think it was the last I<br>read in the Economist that my<br>father-in-law brought round for me to<br>read he cuts out the articles he thinks<br>I should look at that the 14 there's<br>been a 14% bump in GDP in Germany<br>because of the resettlement that's not<br>nothing what you then do with that money<br>and that's the killjoy question that's<br>what's important if so you know myths of<br>scarcity abound the more we have the<br>more we think other people are coming<br>for it and whereas actually Diana was<br>what we learned in the past from a myth<br>effort from the idea that we have enough<br>as long as we work out a wheel a common<br>wealth the common wheel a way of sharing<br>it in common holding it in common so for<br>me yep it's great if we all get an awful<br>lot richer twice as much as a result of<br>freedom of movement but if we spend it<br>on nuclear weapons as my country is<br>doing or if we spend it on building a<br>great big wall across Mexico as a 45th<br>President of the United States of<br>America thinks he should do and propping<br>up the profits of massive global<br>multinational corporations I really<br>don't think it's a good idea I think</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
