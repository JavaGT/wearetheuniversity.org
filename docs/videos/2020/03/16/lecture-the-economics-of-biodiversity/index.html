Professor Dasgupta is one of the world’s leading authorities on the impact of economic and population growth on the environment. He is the Frank Ramsey Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge and Chair of the Management Board of its Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. In 2019, the United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer appointed him to lead an independent global review on the Economics of Biodiversity which aims to assess the economic benefits of biodiversity globally, assess the economic costs and risks of biodiversity loss, and identify actions that can enhance biodiversity and deliver economic prosperity.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

of professors so if I fade out a bit<br>raise your hand and I'll know that I<br>should get back to square one<br>so to speak okay well thank you so much<br>for your very very kind and generous<br>room very much introducing me I wish my<br>children were here<br>they would might be influenced a little<br>bit too I'm usually that provide laughs<br>not for anything else it's a great honor<br>to be here my wife and I have never been<br>to New Zealand before and I now can't<br>imagine why<br>but the your invitation has been a real<br>eye-opener for both of us the economics<br>of biodiversity is a it's all-embracing<br>in some sense and I thought before I<br>kick off with with the lecture I give<br>you a sense of where I'm coming from and<br>why I took up the invitation of the UK<br>government the transfer of the Exchequer<br>to prepare a review which is in fact<br>benefited me enormously because<br>preparing reviews of this sort of design<br>I've never had an experience before of<br>doing that but it concentrates the mind<br>and in a way that I wasn't quite used to<br>so I've learnt enormous amounts in the<br>last eight months and the review will be<br>submitted sometime in August I guess in<br>time for the China cop15 meeting in<br>October my own interest in this field<br>came not because I knew much about<br>biodiversity but I was interested in<br>deep poverty in Africa and Asia which is<br>where I come from South Asia which is<br>they it struck me that development<br>economics or the economics of poverty<br>was poor in not recognizing that<br>our households in poor countries in<br>rural households depend directly on the<br>local natural capital the inhabit the<br>local forests if there is one the<br>grassland if there is one the threshing<br>ground if there is one<br>few animals the water the water holes<br>and the it struck me when I read the<br>anthropological literature and<br>anthropologist who were far ahead of<br>economists in this field I got a sense<br>that the way we modeled the household<br>was quite wrong and misleading because a<br>great deal of the activities of the<br>household on a daily basis was outside<br>the market it's not as though they<br>weren't involved with the market bought<br>and sold for sure but a great deal of<br>their daily income quote-unquote the<br>wherewithal came from the local<br>environment so when deep poverty struck<br>in the sense that you observed villages<br>migrating in distress and the tendency<br>would be to say there was administrative<br>failure or governance failure my I was<br>more on the resource base which had<br>disappeared or deteriorated to the point<br>where you couldn't survive the economics<br>of biodiversity is rich because it is<br>extremely varied it spatially diverse<br>what the life experiences of a village<br>household in Bihar the state of Bihar in<br>India would be very different from the<br>life experiences of a household in Nepal<br>will be in turn very different from the<br>life experiences of a household in<br>Africa and Latin America and so forth<br>are they are various spatially specific<br>because the grassland differs from the<br>rainforest the rainforest differs from a<br>temperate forest<br>so on all this is obviously in some<br>sense truisms but the trick is to see<br>whether you can lift yourself out from<br>this heterogeneity of experiences and<br>come to some picture of the world which<br>Boris builds on the commonality of the<br>human experience is I've never found<br>differences in human experiences all<br>that interesting what interested me<br>always was the fact that people<br>essentially facing very similar problems<br>of course articulated in different ways<br>goes without saying the history depends<br>history differs the ecology differs and<br>so forth but deep down what we care<br>about our family our neighbors our<br>children our great-grandchildren and so<br>forth and we have to solve some resource<br>allocation problems to make them and the<br>core of economics in my judgment was<br>there - how to tease out of the<br>heterogeneity of experience is something<br>like a a unified picture of the forces<br>that operate so there are several ways<br>of attacking looking at the economics of<br>defining or framing the economics of<br>diet that biodiversity you could do the<br>storm you can tell the story or look at<br>its studies as I did in my early days at<br>a very very heterogeneous way very<br>especially specific or you can lift<br>yourself out of that's those<br>specificities and think in some abstract<br>global picture and in this talk today I<br>want to do the latter I want to do the<br>latter because in some ways we are led<br>to thinking globally because we are<br>through our interest in the economics of<br>climate change if you think about what<br>you've been reading in the newspapers<br>you're over the last 5-10 years let's<br>say since Time magazine had a cover<br>story on climate change in 2005 that's<br>all very recent by the way we think we<br>know this has been around for a long<br>while it hasn't it was denied in a big<br>way until very<br>b15 years ago 2005 was I think in some<br>sense of watershed because Time magazine<br>is extremely influential and there was a<br>cover story saying be worried be very<br>worried okay but the narrative there was<br>simplified to the point of noticing that<br>there is a parameter you can look at<br>which is carbon concentration and then<br>from there and mapping an estimate of<br>the implication of carbon concentration<br>on global mean temperature and then of<br>course you can cite track and see what<br>the effect of that functional<br>relationship is on distribution of<br>storms and rainfall and everything and<br>that will be spatially heterogeneous but<br>the focus was again nevertheless despite<br>the heterogeneity on a global picture so<br>we think in terms of a global public bad<br>in this case as in contrasting over the<br>public good at the margin carbon<br>concentration is now harmful at the<br>margin and then we worry about how to<br>think of it as an economic commodity<br>with a negative price we call it the<br>social cost of carbon now one weakness<br>in my judgment and now then I'll come to<br>what a talk of this entire literature is<br>there is a sense in which it encourages<br>us the literature and the economics of<br>climate change encourages us to think of<br>the human economy as distinct from the<br>biosphere from other nature we are<br>outsiders nature is there we are here we<br>depend to nature take stuff out convert<br>it for our purposes consumption of<br>output and consumption and then there is<br>waste which we then throw back in to<br>nature and that exchange is what we<br>study in the economics of climate change<br>now it might seem as though I'm hitting<br>some metaphysical picture of you know us<br>versus the nature and at the end of the<br>day most of us economists work with<br>mathematical models let's face it or<br>we estimate the econometric model okay<br>so where is all this metaphysics coming<br>in but it does because our models<br>reflect our conception of who we are<br>maybe several steps away but if you look<br>deeply into them that's what it's about<br>instead when I think about biodiversity<br>and I'll come to it in some some<br>position I think of the human Enterprise<br>as being embedded in nature and that has<br>deep implications for our conception of<br>what we can achieve how much what we can<br>aspire to and there are details which<br>I'll be hinting out towards the end of<br>this lecture but I can assure you there<br>are formal mathematical models all<br>kosher all publishable in fact latest<br>paper will be published in the<br>Proceedings of the National Academy of<br>Science in about three weeks or so so<br>it's it's okay it meets the young the<br>the standards we feel economists ought<br>to aspire to<br>nevertheless we really have to lift<br>every now and then out of that prism and<br>and look at the world in a humane way in<br>the way our humanity demands of us to do<br>because these are extremely important<br>matters what we leave behind for our<br>descendants is what it is at stake at<br>the end of the day that's what's all<br>about okay let me see how I can if I can<br>municipal and it may do not what I<br>wanted to do ah it does biodiversity<br>means the diversity of life because<br>genes combined to form species species<br>combined to form assemblages and<br>assemblages combine to form communities<br>that interact with the physical world to<br>create ecosystems biodiversity does not<br>only mean the diversity of genes and<br>species but also diversity of ecosystems<br>my unit of account is going to be<br>something like an ecosystem an ecosystem<br>is<br>it's easier to think about it as opposed<br>to defining our mouth our stomachs are<br>ecosystems as are the mountains<br>ecosystems watersheds our ecosystems the<br>domestic pond is an ecosystem it's an<br>arbitrary classification something which<br>you think has a boundary it interacts<br>with the boundary and the relationship<br>with the boundary is weaker than the<br>relationship of the ingredients inside<br>it is as simple as that<br>being too too precise misses the point<br>and biodiversity here is the diversity<br>of life the diversity of ecosystems so<br>its diversity diversity is not I'll come<br>to that in a minute but it's not really<br>an asset ecosystems combine the abiotic<br>environment with biological communities<br>plants animals fungi microorganisms that<br>form functional units and you can see<br>the moment I say functional in units<br>I've already injected an anthropocentric<br>picture in here and I'll come back to<br>that to the limitations of it and I'll<br>come back to that before I proceed much<br>further so ecosystems are assets so we<br>call them natural capital you've heard<br>that expression it's commonplace now you<br>contrast them from roads buildings<br>machines which we call produced capital<br>and from education health and aptitudes<br>which we now call human capital we<br>economists have a history of expanding<br>the notion of capital passively<br>political economists thought in terms of<br>well having said that I'm not sure I<br>should speak because I'm not a historian<br>or the economic thought so this is a<br>slightly flaky rendering as far as I can<br>understand it as far as I know classical<br>political economists out in turn thought<br>of capital as being produced capital<br>roads buildings and so forth factories<br>but Mills I guess a human capital it was<br>introduced into formally into economics<br>quite recently about 50 years ago or so<br>because there are measurement problems<br>how do you measure the benefits of<br>education or good health and but it has<br>now very much entered the scene and<br>natural capital is of course now part<br>and parcel of how we think about the<br>asset base of our economy notice that<br>what really moved to the notion of asset<br>can I'll come back to that in in a<br>minute<br>a crude but effective measure of an<br>ecosystem is its life biomass and<br>ecosystems productivity is the rate at<br>which it produces biomass through<br>photosynthesis Network respiration just<br>as diversity of stocks in a financial<br>portfolio is itself not a stock but a<br>characteristic of the stock namely the<br>portfolio biodiversity is not an asset<br>it is a characteristic of an asset the<br>asset being an ecosystem where that in<br>mind we value diversity in the portfolio<br>of financial portfolio for what among<br>many reasons one of them being that you<br>never know what the return of it from<br>its stock is and so you want to diverse<br>it diversify which means they should not<br>be two correlated because if one goes up<br>the other might go down if one goes down<br>the other might go up on an average you<br>want to have less uncertainty about the<br>performance of your portfolio ideally<br>you would like negative correlation if<br>one goes up the effort other definitely<br>goes down and vice-versa so it fixes the<br>mean but typically we think in insurance<br>companies think in terms of independent<br>risks so that on average the<br>fluctuations are evened out by the law<br>of large numbers okay so likewise the<br>value of biodiversity now come back to<br>that in a minute I'm now referring to<br>the work of huge amount of work that's<br>been done by ecologists and I've have<br>been very fortunate and having<br>ecologists trained me over the past 30<br>years so I speak with some Authority<br>although I'm a not a ecologist myself<br>but what's useful to think of<br>biodiversity as being bits and pieces<br>organisms which interact within the<br>ecosystem to produce services which I'll<br>come to in a minute<br>so already you can see I'm moving in a<br>direction here is our evening towards<br>looking at the biosphere or ecosystems<br>which are components of the biosphere as<br>factories gigantic factories or very<br>very tiny factories like my mouth is<br>about is a is an ecosystem what sorts of<br>bacteria working away and keeping me<br>reasonably healthy so it's a factory<br>churning out stuff and we want to see<br>what the stuff is so the economics our<br>biodiversity is of the economics of the<br>biosphere and because ecosystems are<br>assets the economics of the biosphere<br>involves the study of asset management<br>problems now you can see that I'm<br>hitting a economic tone and I want to<br>stop for just a minute to see to ensure<br>to assure you that I'm not taking a<br>vulgar economic position here why do we<br>care about the biosphere why do we think<br>it's very important well let me give you<br>a story which is true 1997 in the<br>journal science very respectable journal<br>an article is published by grouper<br>ecologist who tried to estimate offered<br>an estimate of the benefits humanity<br>enjoys from the biosphere and the<br>estimate let's stop we they knew it was<br>amazingly approximate many things were<br>missing here ever knows what the<br>estimate was something like let us say I<br>can't remember exactly but we are I'm<br>talking order of magnitude something<br>like 32 to 33 trillion US dollars a year<br>of benefits big about oh sorry yes thank<br>you<br>something like 33 trillion international<br>dollars in about 1997 and the idea was<br>to say that look the biosphere matters<br>is extremely important see how valuable<br>it is now when I read it I thought it<br>was just upside down it was just the<br>wrong way of going about it because if<br>the bias<br>disappears we disappear we are dead so<br>there's nobody to exchange 33 trillion<br>dollars per year<br>economics is supposed to serve our<br>ethics it's not determining our ethics<br>and I think that's where it went wrong<br>that kind of calculation we care about<br>the biosphere because it is part of us<br>are we a part of it how we work within<br>it is of course the moot point and we<br>want to estimate the value of changes<br>that we bring about to the biosphere by<br>our actions a dead zone here and<br>improved lake there and so forth and<br>they're competing with many of our other<br>aspirations like roads buildings<br>education and so forth so we're looking<br>at an asset management problem and I<br>want to stick to this when I say the<br>asset management problem it is an asset<br>management problem no matter which<br>culture you come from that's the key<br>thing this is this is not making in the<br>making this claim that the economics are<br>biodiversity is about managing assets is<br>not a claim that this is a European<br>modern European view of life if you<br>happen to be a forest inhabitant in the<br>in Assam they too are concerned with<br>managing assets in fact I know of no<br>household which is not concerned with<br>managing assets that's how I began this<br>lecture by saying I was studying<br>households and they have to manage<br>assets so it's an asset management<br>problem how you value the assets of<br>course that's where some of the<br>interesting questions arise and I'll<br>come to that as we go along what we<br>equate to our descendants are assets by<br>assets I mean durable goods okay we<br>don't hand over services to our children<br>we hand over rights to services we<br>sometimes say I'm handing over income to<br>my grandson but you're not you're<br>handing over claims to income<br>to your gun sir that is your handing<br>over assets it could be in form of<br>education it could be in the form of<br>good health it could be in the form of<br>cultural norm assimilation of cultural<br>norms which makes life easier for the<br>person to do work in the society he or<br>she happens to be but it is that's what<br>we do that's what we're doing so I'm<br>very much engaged in this the economics<br>of biodiversity with the management of<br>assets just as private firms create<br>balance sheets national governments<br>should now create a system of wealth<br>accounts in which wealth includes not<br>only the value of produced capital and<br>human capital but natural capital - now<br>this is a throwaway line there's a huge<br>amount of economics in embedded in that<br>last sentence but I've actually led you<br>to it towards it anyway<br>because if you're interested in assets<br>then you look at the portfolio you're<br>handing over and and you have to figure<br>out how to measure the value of the<br>portfolio that you're giving to your<br>children grandchildren and so forth and<br>so on ok so now moving as I say using<br>very often the imagery of the household<br>but then mapping it onto the level of<br>the nation and maybe as I go along to<br>the globe as a whole the globe as a<br>whole is easier to study than than<br>individual nations because you don't<br>have to worry about trade it gets inputs<br>and exports balance off of course there<br>is issues of inequality and so forth but<br>I will come to that I'll leave ignore<br>that for a while today what does the<br>power sphere as an asset offer<br>well the Millennium ecosystem assessment<br>of 2005 really pioneering piece of work<br>by an enormously large group of<br>economists and ecologists something like<br>1500 people were involved in it provided<br>a classification and in some sense set<br>the tone of the discussion this<br>classification has been modified<br>subsequently but I find there's still to<br>be for my purposes very very useful they<br>talk about provisioning services the<br>services which yield food fiber Tim<br>Burton<br>water it's extremely important to bear<br>this in mind I'll come back to the<br>tensions that arise in our use of the<br>biosphere second regulating services<br>protection against natural hazards such<br>as storms and the disease environment<br>climate system protection against<br>natural hazards you need an example<br>mangrove forests very classic examples<br>of how they printed protect villages<br>behind the incoming storms from<br>protection and mangrove forests are rich<br>in biodiversity they do many other<br>things besides their love for fish<br>populations to thrive and so forth okay<br>so the the the mangrove which is giving<br>regulating services is also providing<br>food so there are provision services ok<br>so there are multiple products that come<br>out of these ecosystems supporting<br>services nutrient cycling recycling soil<br>production waste assimilation and I want<br>to emphasize waste assimilation in a<br>minute because the economics of climate<br>change is all about waste the waste<br>being carbon dioxide which you're<br>producing as a byproduct of what you're<br>producing namely a trip in an airplane<br>ok so that's a waste it's a waste<br>because you're dumping it back into the<br>biosphere right so I want to focus on<br>that later on so that supporting<br>services now notice one thing regulating<br>and supporting services are on the whole<br>anonymous you don't see them you don't<br>feel them what you do feel them when you<br>when the storm comes and you're hiding<br>but the point is that that service is<br>sort of intent very intangible it's not<br>like fruit growing in a tree which is<br>more tangible and I'll come back to that<br>because in some ways our deep problems<br>with the biosphere all the way we have<br>mismanaged our lives rests on the fact<br>that many of these services are hidden<br>are hidden we don't even know that<br>they're there<br>the soil for example what happens the<br>soil is one of the most I've been<br>reading about soil for quite some time<br>now and as ecosystems they are<br>absolutely fascinating largely because<br>people know except for the soil<br>scientists very little about them but of<br>course they're absolutely essential for<br>our lives and then forth it's cultural<br>services recreation cultural landscape<br>aesthetic and spiritual experiences ok<br>now there's a deep sense in which our<br>societies have run into a tension<br>between type 1 provisioning services and<br>the other 3 and I'll come back to that<br>in a minute ok I just want to flag that<br>it's not as though we can have all of<br>them there they're in competition for<br>our attention and very often we have in<br>the past gone for one and harmed two<br>three and four okay the demands we make<br>of the bus fare takes two forms we<br>harvest the biosphere as goods and<br>services for consumption and production<br>say think of fisheries forests aquifers<br>our prototypical sources fisheries<br>there's a fishery you take the stuff out<br>that gave you a picture of our our<br>relationship with biosphere is being<br>external and that's fits in well with<br>this description and then we use the<br>biosphere as a sink for our waste<br>landfills dead zones and carbon<br>concentration in the atmosphere are<br>prominent examples and I won't belabor<br>that point but the reason I want to<br>distinguish these two but keep them in<br>in our mind is that there are mirror<br>images of each other and if you see that<br>you immediately recognize that pollution<br>is the reverse of conservation and that<br>we are really talking about the same<br>phenomenon our engagement with the virus<br>fear so if you think a pollution as a<br>separate activity requires a separate<br>treatment from harvesting natural<br>resources harvesting from the biosphere<br>then you are missing something the to<br>amount to one is a positive and the<br>other is a negative impact<br>that connection says that we can unify<br>them the two forms of demand and view<br>the biosphere as a renewable natural<br>resource and that's what I'm going to do<br>so I'm now aggregating in a massive way<br>but I feel comfortable doing that<br>because I can give you a very micro<br>story with the same kind of<br>classification and I'll be Khan and that<br>will be very very reasonable so the link<br>between the very micro and the global is<br>not in principle different from the way<br>that we create the link between<br>household economy and the global economy<br>never mind<br>ecosystems we do thinks about global GDP<br>well there we are<br>global GDP what does that mean you're<br>adding up all the other final outputs<br>using market prices of course we have a<br>problem here we can't do that because<br>many of these services don't have<br>markets so you have to value them<br>outside the market system okay so I want<br>you to think of the biosphere for our<br>purposes now at this for this lecture<br>for the next few minutes as an renewable<br>resources like a fishery or a forest<br>fish are born they live and then then<br>die you can catch fish and so long as<br>you don't take fish out at the rate<br>faster than their natural rajendra<br>regenerative rate for too long you're<br>okay you can have a sustainable fishery<br>but you keep on taking more than the<br>rate at which they can regenerate<br>themselves net birth rates then of<br>course the fishery eventually dies<br>collapse officially through overfishing<br>that imagery is very powerful and<br>correct there's nothing wrong with that<br>image and I want to fill that in in what<br>follows by an eco systems productivity<br>you remember notice I'm using it now<br>totally as though nature is a productive<br>asset and I got to see how far we can<br>run with it we mean the flow of goods<br>and services it officers and its ability<br>withstand disturbances I look at the<br>second one<br>as well because looking only it means<br>the average is very dangerous with<br>uncertainty you really do want to look<br>at the risk involved in it<br>so ability to withstand this disturbance<br>is sometimes nowadays it's called<br>resilience of the system picks up our<br>attitude to it's risk it's extremely<br>important what I've just now said<br>because a great deal of the work in the<br>economics of climate change has actually<br>ignored the uncertainty part and they<br>have looked at average mean expected<br>expected values of losses due to higher<br>carbon concentrations so when you read<br>sometimes as The Economist is prone to<br>publishing because they like to show<br>that hard-headed economics tells you not<br>to worry too much that say the Greenland<br>ice caps all disappear and it will only<br>add 5 cents to the shadow of social cost<br>of carbon and you say to yourself there<br>is something deeply wrong about<br>economics it's not economics which is at<br>fault it's a misuse of it you're looking<br>at only the mean and you can only those<br>things you can measure because it<br>doesn't pass the laugh test which is if<br>Greenland ice disappears it's not going<br>to be just if somebody says it's 3 3<br>cents more on the social cost of carbon<br>you would say there's something<br>inherently implausible in it in this<br>estimate ok so I want to include<br>resilience we may think of any Co<br>systems productivity of the rate at<br>which it regenerates itself subject to<br>the uncertainty of course so note the<br>similarity with the product productivity<br>or performance of financial portfolios I<br>keep on coming back to that because in a<br>minute I'm going to give you some hard<br>economics so there is a tension between<br>our demands as they appear in one that<br>is provisioning services food timber<br>water and so forth and three-to-two for<br>supporting Vanetta regulatory electing<br>and cultural services which we have<br>already<br>effectively the more we convert the<br>biosphere so that so that it serves one<br>provisioning services the less there is<br>of it to serve to to for regulating<br>supporting and cultural services now is<br>it's a commonplace observations you hear<br>a new sense that when great swaths of<br>land are converted into farmland you<br>have lost something that tension is what<br>I'm pointing to here okay you need to<br>have produce food so you need a green<br>collar okay but that has a cost and the<br>cost is in terms of services which might<br>undermine other aspects of our life not<br>just virtual our sustenance now a large<br>an extremely interesting valuable<br>literature has found our researchers<br>found biodiversity enhances ecosystem<br>productivity in supplying supporting<br>regulating and cultural services<br>biodiversity is not very useful for<br>agriculture we know that that the whole<br>point about agriculture is to make it<br>extremely homogeneous you're actually<br>killing biodiversity or plantations I<br>want to bring this out because if when<br>when you hear the expression<br>biodiversity is is a contributor to<br>ecosystem productivity it's not all the<br>services it's one class three classes of<br>services extremely important easy to<br>miss and that's why we're in a mess<br>because we miss it we don't miss the<br>food side we don't miss the water side<br>we don't miss the forest side excuse me<br>but we do miss these hidden services<br>which are keeping us afloat and here the<br>reason is very similar similar to our<br>financial portfolios you have species<br>waiting in the wings times are good it<br>they'll be waiting in the wings because<br>the dominant species will will provide<br>the services the ecosystem that you<br>value but times get rough and the<br>dominant ones weaken the other the winds<br>which are waiting in the wing is this of<br>course a metaphor but now not this<br>conditions are right for them maybe<br>their root system is<br>slightly different longer deeper let's<br>spread out but now that comes in helpful<br>so very much like a financial portfolio<br>is biodiversity serves a purpose at<br>another level another way of looking at<br>it would be to say that biodiversity the<br>weather at the genetic level gene level<br>or whether the level of ecosystems<br>themselves because some ecosystems<br>provide this kind of service other<br>ecosystem provides some other service so<br>there's complementarities there would be<br>that maybe biodiversity is a bit like<br>having complementary inputs in<br>production or in consumption consumption<br>if you have only left true but not a<br>right shoe well it's not going to be<br>very helpful you need one of each those<br>are compliments<br>likewise in a factory if you have only<br>labour but no machine tools not much<br>output comes out machine tools but no<br>labour not much output comes out you<br>need both complementarities so there is<br>an element of that in biodiversity as<br>well so bad diversity is a<br>characteristic of ecosystems they are<br>not ecosystems themselves as it manages<br>from the household all the way up to the<br>government study the returns their<br>portfolios offer whether the services we<br>draw from the biosphere in total is<br>large or whether it's small in<br>proportion to an economy's GDP is not<br>the issue and I want to is illustrate<br>what I mean by that so suppose somebody<br>I began with that example where the<br>biosphere offers 25 or 33 or whatever<br>trillion dollars and I explain why<br>that's a bogus meaningless estimate<br>because he doesn't tell you anything but<br>suppose somebody said something much<br>more meaningful say that pollination<br>contributes to agriculture in the UK to<br>the tune of I might get this wrong but<br>look and we're talking about orders of<br>magnitude 580 million pounds a year okay<br>I think I've got it right approximately<br>right in fact the chancellor of the<br>exchequer used that when he announced to<br>Parliament that he was asking me to<br>asked me to prepare the review of the<br>economics of artifice you know that's a<br>perfectly meaningful statement because<br>if that's withdrawn it's not going to be<br>the end of humanity it'll be a bit rough<br>on UK agriculture that's for sure but<br>that's a meaningful statement that's the<br>benefit a great culture has from<br>pollination so you value the pollinators<br>the bees the birds and so forth<br>and earth where I'm sensible ok does<br>that tell you how much you should spend<br>on investing in pollinators you see<br>that's that's the key thing because<br>you're an asset manager remember so you<br>want to know whether which assets to<br>invest in that pollination gives a huge<br>amount each year to agriculture on its<br>own is not going to tell you whether you<br>should put your money in on pollinators<br>or not I came across this phenomenon<br>some years ago when a group of us tried<br>to estimate the quantity of the the<br>inclusive wealth of India and amongst in<br>other than them four other countries so<br>the idea was to look at the estimate<br>produced capital human capital and<br>natural capital I never mind how would<br>they we got it how proximately wrong we<br>got it we got it wrong sure that writer<br>than most other people because they<br>ignored most stuff anyway so we found<br>something very interesting at least to<br>us it was the office which was that not<br>human capital absolutely swamped at two<br>orders of magnitude reduced capital and<br>natural capital what do I mean by that I<br>meant that if you write down the X<br>amount that you have estimated of the<br>wealth of India aggregate wealth of<br>India adding up all these bits and<br>pieces then something a 99% of that<br>wealth is in human capital why because<br>the reason is that people prefer to live<br>than to die and we value life<br>usually and so what we wanted to do we<br>wanted to measure the improvement in<br>human capital the quantity of human<br>capital the value of human capital in<br>India over a period of time meanwhile<br>during that period life expectancy had<br>increased in India altogether a good<br>thing so you need to value that and what<br>we did was to use the value of a<br>statistical life which is a very<br>well-known way of thinking about the<br>value of not a person's life but<br>statistical life it's not a value of a<br>life but statistical life turns out it's<br>huge it's about 6 million dollars even a<br>poor country like India at least at the<br>time we were doing it so you're going to<br>add them up it's about 99 percent okay<br>what do you take from that do you then<br>say oh we should put more money into<br>health all the investment of government<br>should go in there or maybe you say well<br>that's enough now we should put all our<br>money in elsewhere intuition doesn't<br>tell you where to go and that's right<br>inclusion shouldn't because these<br>figures are not meant to tell the<br>portfolio manager where what to invest<br>in what does tell him is rate of return<br>so the portfolio manager in financial<br>portfolios is on the right track now put<br>the return I'll be talking about is<br>different from financial return that<br>you'll see in a minute so now here's<br>their first exercise I'm really rather<br>proud of this because mycologist friends<br>never did this exercise although they<br>had the ingredients to do that using<br>remote sensing data planetary net<br>primary productivity that is the net<br>output a biomass per year is currently<br>about 105 has been estimated to be<br>currently I'm sorry this is a<br>grammatically incorrect estimated to be<br>about 105 trillion kgs kilograms okay<br>I'm asking you to take the figure as a<br>fact quotient good as a factoid the same<br>techniques have been used to estimate<br>the global stock of life biomass which<br>has been thought to be about 550<br>Trillian kgs so the latter is a stock<br>the former is a flow and remember we<br>started with the notion of bow-bow<br>masses being the currency with which we<br>look at the productivity of a of a of an<br>ecosystem and that distribution of that<br>biomass is what's giving us the services<br>so we had a story of the productivity of<br>ecosystem in terms of biomass production<br>and the stock so one is a flow in the<br>other is a stop so what does a manager<br>do it divides one by the other to look<br>at the average rate or return if you do<br>that the average rate of global average<br>rate of return is 19 percent a year 105<br>divided by 5 50 a year okay when<br>compared to government bonds in the UK<br>for example say 4% a year we are staring<br>at a huge distortion in the global<br>economy investment should now be<br>directed at enhancing the biosphere not<br>drinking it because the return on the<br>biosphere is much higher never mind<br>prices we haven't come to that yet I'll<br>see you it show you exactly how to nail<br>the argument down so you have your own<br>rate of return of 19 percent in one case<br>never mind whether the figure is inks<br>it's a huge ballpark difference between<br>that and and the reduced capital return<br>which is reflected in say the government<br>bond if you if this were an efficient<br>portfolio how would you close the gap<br>between the two own rates of return if<br>you've ever dealt with financial<br>economists they will tell you capital<br>gains the relative price change in that<br>you during the year so if this was an<br>efficient portfolio which of course we<br>know it isn't but I'll put nailed it<br>down in a minute<br>the gap between 19% and 4% which is 15%<br>should be the capital gains on produced<br>capital this produced capital is a very<br>low return 4% in on rate of return so if<br>it values goes up relative to the<br>biosphere about 15% then at the margin<br>we are indifferent between holding them<br>an additional unit of the biosphere<br>initial unit produced capital this is<br>bread and butter portfolio analysis<br>first-year undergraduates do this<br>that's called efficiency for arbitrary<br>equations in financial capital I mean<br>some people are nodding so I know there<br>are financial experts here you can see<br>why I mean it's very easy to see this<br>equation think I owe it to to explain it<br>slightly better you have a million<br>dollars and you can put it in the bank<br>and then let us say 4% a year so at the<br>end of the year you will have a million<br>plus 4% of me as against that you could<br>buy a house and it'll give you some rent<br>okay<br>suppose the rent of that is less than 4%<br>of a million thirty thousand let's say<br>forty thousand would have been four<br>percent so do you then say no I'm gonna<br>put the money in the bank you know you<br>don't because you ask at the end of the<br>year will there be some capital gains on<br>my house will the price appreciate and<br>if the price appreciates just that much<br>to close the gap you'll say well I'm<br>indifferent between putting the money in<br>the the bank or the house because the<br>rent on the house is like the own rate<br>of return which I've just now calculated<br>for the biosphere and on top of that<br>there will be the capital gains in this<br>case the capital gains needs to be on<br>the produced capital because the rate of<br>return was very low relative to the<br>biosphere but of course we know it's<br>just the wrong way around if the capital<br>gains on the produced capital is to rise<br>it means you have undervalued produced<br>capital but meanwhile of course you are<br>accumulating produced capital and<br>accumulating the biosphere and I'll come<br>back to that that evidence in a minute<br>so it suggests that we're completely off<br>Hylton our portfolio management of the<br>biosphere is complete<br>not only wrong and this is to me about<br>as convincing a way of showing how we<br>have over reached our ideal ease with<br>nature there are many many others but<br>this is a part is convincing because<br>it's hard to the economic argument<br>never mind the approximations involved<br>so how and why has this imbalance come<br>about and I will end it in this lecture<br>by going a little bit the economist<br>Angus Madison the lake's<br>Angus Madison spent most of his life at<br>the OECD and he was one of those number<br>crunchers in some deep sense very boring<br>but to me he is a giant because what he<br>tried to do was to estimate track the<br>world economy back to year one see two<br>thousand years ago and see how the<br>various regions including the globe<br>itself has prospered since then whatever<br>data he could get hold of he tried and<br>the story he gave up his book was<br>published in 2001 a few years before he<br>died and I think it's very very<br>revealing which say it's something like<br>this it's consistent with many other<br>stories by the way met many other<br>account this one is saying that per<br>capita GDP from year one on what now<br>you're normalizing so they said year two<br>thousand two thousand prices so I'm not<br>I'm aware of the fact that price changes<br>have taken place so you'll normalize for<br>that corrected for that per capita GDP<br>was little over a dollar and ninety<br>cents until about fifteen hundred eighty<br>or C was pretty flat all the regions<br>there are five regions he looked at<br>Europe Asia Africa the new world and so<br>forth and then there's hardly any<br>variation<br>of course they were fluctuation see you<br>know the Black Death and so forth but<br>broad over the long haul this is pretty<br>flat and people were desperately poor on<br>average that's pretty poor you can track<br>also life expectancy which are much more<br>reliable data and life expectancy didn't<br>change very much we are looking at 26 27<br>28 years life expectancy at birth<br>constant remaining pretty much constant<br>of course black death again screws up<br>things but broadly speaking this is true<br>things started diverging about 1500 as<br>you know from normal discourses on<br>economic history particularly took place<br>in Europe then subsequently in the new<br>world and there was a big divergence<br>from Asia including China but the real<br>action started as we all know from our<br>rudimentary economic history the<br>Industrial Revolution and some parts of<br>the world took off but before we get too<br>carried away they didn't really take off<br>not in a huge way<br>per capita annual income in year 1950<br>globally was 3,500 international dollars<br>at 2011 prices legacy no that's a lot<br>higher than the 780 or so that prevailed<br>until about 1200 the 1.9 dollar a day<br>the World Bank poverty line as it were<br>but today per capita income in the world<br>is about 17 thousand international<br>dollars so there's a five-fold increase<br>in per capita income population has<br>increased from 2.5 billion to 7 point 7<br>billion so you've had a three-fold<br>increase there so multiply the two and<br>you have a 15 fold increase in global<br>GDP over a 70 year period<br>this is my economic calculation I did<br>that because I read an article in 2016<br>in science which showed it's a beautiful<br>piece of work by scientists who collated<br>the evidence of biogeochemical<br>signatures including phosphorus and<br>nitrogen deposits in ice cores and<br>sediments tracked it from the past is a<br>huge amount of data out there and they<br>were basically summarizing it and they<br>found that if you product from here<br>11,000 minus 2 now they can do that by<br>the way then you have basis essentially<br>a flat curve like the Madison data on<br>national income and life expectancy and<br>then takes a huge sharp turn about 1950<br>upwards the hockey stick that you're<br>familiar with those of you who have<br>looked at time series of carbon<br>concentration and current temperature so<br>it's not just carbon it's not just<br>temperature it's a bunch of other<br>signatures which of course brings me<br>back to the biodiversity it's not just<br>climate change but the tampering of the<br>biosphere has been enormous in this last<br>70 years to the extent that now<br>officially our scientists are telling us<br>that 1950 you have to take some not date<br>is the year where we entered the<br>Anthropocene if you google it you will<br>find if you say what's the Anthropocene<br>they'll tell you the earth scientists<br>now saying if you have to choose<br>something but it's a dramatic break is<br>what did the trick so I looked at this<br>economic data only to convince myself<br>that there was something going on which<br>would give me a consistent picture of<br>our over overshoot so question why the<br>overshoot can be understood in terms of<br>the idea of externalities which are they<br>unaccounted for consequences for others<br>of the actions we take that's pretty<br>straightforward<br>you know all about that we know about<br>the tragedy of Commons so much of the<br>biosphere is an open access resource<br>meaning that its products and services<br>do not have a price attached to them<br>leading to the tragedy of the Commons<br>you're familiar with that literature<br>it's correct but the force of that<br>tragedy has been felt more recently and<br>I'll come back to that in my concluding<br>remarks the matter is made worse by<br>government subsidies on agriculture<br>energy water and forestry nature<br>supporting and regulating services now<br>come with a negative price so it's not<br>just the tragedy of the Commons we have<br>a double whammy<br>something we should have a positive<br>price is would have a negative price<br>because of the tragedy the Commons the<br>openness of the biosphere but on top of<br>that we're encouraging ourselves we're<br>giving us the incentive financial<br>incentives to take some more out so it's<br>a negative price that's really create<br>distortions question why do we think<br>what happened about 1950 many things<br>happen I suspect for example antibiotics<br>have a lot to do with it because it made<br>life so much better for us and of course<br>it's had it trigger mechanism for<br>population growth as well we have never<br>had it so good that's for sure and we<br>are told that repeatedly and this<br>morning when we were having a discussion<br>we all agreed this is we've never had it<br>so good<br>this last 70 years have been a terrific<br>time to be alive you would choose this<br>period over any other period if God<br>dropped you randomly in to some<br>household or the other it would be a<br>no-brainer this is the time to be born<br>but the cost is about the future our<br>descendants that's the that's the that's<br>the real problem<br>and that's what I'm really focusing<br>attention on here and that is we don't<br>have the mechanism the to to correct for<br>this override one of the reasons the<br>last decades have been particularly<br>harmful is that our technologies have<br>accentuated the errors or deficiency of<br>our institutions so technological<br>advances in safe fishing deep-sea<br>fishing technological advances in mining<br>technological advances in DeForest<br>timber gathering those advances were<br>targeted at saving labor cost<br>not saving natural capital in fact just<br>the reverse there came - how do we get<br>the stuff out from there and conversion<br>so I'm very skeptical when people say oh<br>technology will fix us our problems I'm<br>skeptical about for a variety of reasons<br>one of them is that you don't have the<br>incentives right incentives so the the<br>distortions which led leads us to the<br>problem are also the distortions which<br>exacerbates the problem because the<br>technological breakthroughs are working<br>against the problem so now I want to<br>wrap up I want to summarize you mean I'm<br>an economic theorist and you've been<br>wondering where is the equation so here<br>it is one way of thinking about it and<br>the only way of summarizing what I've<br>been saying is to think of the biosphere<br>as a pool from which we take we are<br>about the metaphor that I've been using<br>all evening and we want to look at the<br>demand we make of it on an annual basis<br>let's say and its capacity to supply if<br>the demand exceeds the supply the<br>quality and quantity of the biosphere in<br>terms of biomass declines if it's less<br>then the biosphere improves we see this<br>locally when you have a restoration<br>project say for example Zealandia well<br>that's where the bar is not the<br>biosphere for that ecosystem has<br>improved so what you're taking out is<br>less than what your what its<br>regenerative capacity is so we've seen<br>that but are now looking at globally so<br>if n capital n is global population why<br>is the standard of living GDP per capita<br>time you will use GDP per capita because<br>that's well not this easily measurable<br>or at least we think it's easily<br>measurable and alpha is a numerical<br>measure measure of the efficiency with<br>which nature's products and services are<br>converted into GDP humanity's aggregate<br>demand from the biosphere is n times y<br>divided by alpha in a sustainable state<br>of affairs that demand equals the supply<br>which I'm going to call capital G the<br>capital G depends on the stock at less<br>so I've got a very conventional capital<br>theoretic model as it<br>management problem if however aggregate<br>demand exceeds or is less than the<br>biosphere we gently regenerate the stock<br>s diminishes increases farts warningly<br>increases over the past 70 years or so<br>since we entered the Anthropocene we<br>have an inequality the demand exceeds<br>the supply the overwhelming bulk of<br>discussions around climate change global<br>climate change has been on fire finding<br>ways to increase alpha that's one of the<br>weaknesses of that literature as I come<br>in from outside<br>I'm not worked on climate change but<br>that's one grave error I think in my<br>judgment it's been you on alpha<br>mitigation find alternative sources of<br>energy very reasonable thing to do<br>but the point is the idea is that you<br>fight if you increase alpha then of<br>course you're reducing the left hand<br>side of the inequality you're dividing<br>by a larger number the need if the<br>denominator rises then NY upon alpha<br>declines other things equal so the way<br>it took to combat that's inequality to<br>bring it into an inequality would be to<br>increase alpha that's the only thing<br>that's means discussed but of course<br>you've been opinion we have managing<br>Paris is Paris maybe it'll change but it<br>hasn't so far there are two other<br>factors which are completely neglected<br>because we are shy of discussing them<br>capital N and small why the numerator is<br>aggregate demand and their population<br>numbers and the quality the kind of life<br>we want to lead that's missing from this<br>discussion for reasons I don't need to<br>belabor you are as familiar with it as<br>any but I think if we are serious about<br>these matters nothing should be out of<br>the table it is to me a very sad thing<br>that family planning expenditure as a<br>proportion of Internet Aid is abysmal in<br>0.6% of international global<br>international aid goes to family<br>planning and usually the family planning<br>experts sit in the basement<br>of the government offices they're not<br>the stars but of course at the margin<br>they can be of enormous help and you<br>know help because they we're looking at<br>not today then tomorrow is capital a<br>reproductive successes is it well if you<br>like and it meets the needs of so many<br>unwanted pregnancies that women suffer<br>from and if you read the literature on<br>on this class of issues it's really<br>shocking because we on the one hand talk<br>about gender issues and we are not<br>allowing a deep expression of the demand<br>for safe pregnancies and so forth in our<br>there on our agenda so I think there's<br>room there any amount of this is not<br>about coercion it's not about one child<br>family policy and so forth we're looking<br>at the fact that if asked women respond<br>positively to be given information and<br>help over family planning over and over<br>again it's been seen what about small<br>why when we talk about it and we change<br>our behavior plastics changes very<br>quickly in a matter of months but we<br>need to talk about that too but though I<br>want to conclude by saying pointing to<br>some hope and that hope for me lies in<br>an undetected aspect of the human<br>personality and it it makes its mark in<br>both capital N and small Y small Y is<br>consumption the standard of living what<br>we which is that all the models that we<br>teach youngsters in economics and the<br>models that drive Treasury across the<br>world Treasury models of the macro<br>economy are built on the idea that we<br>are egoists we care about our of course<br>we care about our family but that's<br>about it but we it's a supermarket<br>picture of life we are encouraged<br>spend because otherwise employment is in<br>jeopardy so you feel you're doing a<br>social good by visiting the supermarket<br>more often than less often the advanced<br>picture is that it's the story in which<br>what you care about is your income or<br>your wealth depending on long horizon<br>you okay and the prices that you face<br>for goods and services you or don't look<br>in the supermarket story you don't look<br>to see what others are consuming and<br>that's the lack of social social Ness in<br>our personalities which I think probably<br>is undermining many of their search for<br>ways to reduce the left-hand side the<br>numerator oddly there is a good deal of<br>evidence now coming from sociology<br>anthropology in the field of consumption<br>behavior and fertility behavior which<br>points to the fact that we our behavior<br>is influenced by the behavior of our<br>neighbors peer group now that sounds<br>banal but it's not banal when you think<br>that the model is rejected in everything<br>that we do in economics whether it's a<br>Treasury model of the models we teach<br>and the what gives us the architecture<br>of our conception of the human economy<br>now the great concentrate on the the the<br>conformist side of our preferences our<br>aspirations which is we don't want to be<br>too different from others those we care<br>about it could be our neighbors it could<br>be the internet might make us extend the<br>horizon to people we don't even know and<br>there's and this is not speculation by<br>the way there's now a good deal of<br>empirical work on this very sound once<br>natural experiments which confirmed but<br>I'm just now saying but we need more of<br>this kind of research but it says that a<br>shared Laurie<br>of something is far less costly the new<br>lateral lowering we hear anecdotes from<br>our grandparents or parents depending on<br>your age that during the war there was<br>general depth<br>but is not shared deprivation they were<br>rationing<br>and they weren't going to save they were<br>deeply unhappy we're very worried about<br>the war but unhappiness is not the first<br>thing that talk about whatever they talk<br>about the fact that you know the country<br>is at risk and so forth but that's a<br>different kind of right so there was an<br>anecdotal case but we have never built<br>on that to try and understand how to<br>test for it from raw data there are<br>reasons why econometricians do not like<br>to think about this kind of problem<br>because there are endogeneity issues in<br>writing down these equations there's a<br>formal reason for it but technique<br>should not stop us from thinking a lack<br>of technique shouldn't tell myself as<br>from thinking so I would argue that<br>there is hope if that there if we could<br>somehow recognize the deep wedge between<br>the left hand side and the right hand<br>side of what I have got in equality and<br>to close the gap will require of us to<br>reduce the left hand side and one class<br>of ways will be to reduce the numerator<br>of the left hand side not simply<br>increase the denominator then if we<br>search hard enough for evidence and ways<br>of thinking about the human condition I<br>think there is a chance that we will be<br>willing to take cuts because it'll be<br>shared or shared not just amongst<br>ourselves but perhaps shared with those<br>who are less fortunate but those are<br>speculations at the moment I will<br>conclude there because these problems<br>are difficult and are practical give you<br>in an hour's talk a sense of how<br>difficult it is how treacherous terrain<br>is because there are science is<br>difficult the economics is difficult but<br>on top of that there is sensitivities<br>thank you very much everyone and I just<br>want to we're gonna have a couple of<br>questions first my name is Adrian<br>Orville and I'm here representing the<br>Reserve Bank of New Zealand I'll stop<br>shouting and use the microphone just<br>before we rush to questions I just want<br>to acknowledge Victoria University of<br>Wellington capital Wellington for<br>working so closely with us with the<br>Reserve Bank of New Zealand this series<br>of lectures from distinguished<br>professors has been going on for many<br>many years now in fact I could probably<br>say decades safely and and tonight I<br>would say I've never seen such an<br>engaged and large audience sir spear<br>partner has stood up and everything that<br>Wendy promised us in the sense that he<br>is tackling the largest issues that I<br>believe an economist can tackle you're<br>doing it was enormous humanity and<br>insight many many people could<br>understand that whether you are any<br>conks profession professional or someone<br>involved in the sciences that shows true<br>understanding you took it from the<br>absolute micro through to macro through<br>to global in terms of the understanding<br>you a unifying the thought on the way<br>through not only that you took it from a<br>single time period but intergenerational<br>which is too often missed around the<br>conversations that have gone gone on and<br>and you are using standard tools you're<br>standing on the shoulders of giants to<br>bring back things that really matter to<br>us because what gets measured generally<br>gets managed and I love the idea that<br>you bring in there that even<br>approximations of important things are<br>better than ignoring those important<br>things all together when you're managing<br>it and you're thinking about a portfolio<br>long term sustainable activities so it's<br>it's a wonderful thing I'm also very<br>impressed that the UK<br>the Chancellor of the Exchequer is<br>thinking beyond just bricks it and<br>supporting important research and having<br>being able to use wonderful people like<br>yourself to do the important work that<br>you were doing so I am absolutely<br>humbled to be here and part of it now we<br>have can you decide what with five<br>minutes for questions the clock by the<br>way you spoke so well the time went<br>backwards so so we've got we've got ten<br>minutes we've got roving microphones and<br>please keep your questions as questions<br>and short and concise thank you hi thank<br>you for the good talk and I have many<br>questions about us the simplest one and<br>just the number you mentioned the<br>International dollars from nodding 1950s<br>3000 turn to the current 15000 did that<br>the International dollar GDP GDP from<br>1950s 3000 to nowadays 15000 does that<br>are you factoring the inflation and the<br>purchasing power so equivalent to okay<br>now in spite of the that we live in a<br>connected world and we continue things<br>made elsewhere have you looked at<br>different countries how much they have<br>kept or squandered the natural capital<br>and you could give us a few examples of<br>good countries which have kept most of<br>the natural capital compared to the 1960<br>situation we measured Dyson's<br>destruction of wealth said<br>natural capital thank you very much the<br>other Norwegian exchanges others well<br>thank you very much that's a that's it<br>I'm glad you asked the question because<br>it's something I've worked on myself and<br>encouraged others to do so the question<br>is we started but think in terms of<br>wealth and being let's say these three<br>categories of capital assets and how do<br>they pan out if you look at some time<br>series in different countries the most<br>recent work that's been done has been<br>done by the United Nations Environment<br>Programme UNEP pub called the inclusive<br>wealth of nations report 2018 came out<br>in 2018 and it has about 120 countries<br>look if you can't be sensitive when you<br>read this kind of stuff it's really<br>vulgar but that's the best thing that's<br>going and I also like to say to myself<br>that the World Bank publications are<br>equally vulgar it's just that we don't<br>say it because they're powerful and they<br>they've been doing it for a long time so<br>we're used to it so okay so what do we<br>do find they find that for most<br>countries in the third world and the<br>poor countries in Africa only 45<br>countries from the developing side there<br>was a cumulation of human capital per<br>capita and and produced capital per<br>capita but declining natural capital now<br>that that decline is in some sense an<br>upper bound because many natural forms<br>of natural capital are missing for its<br>data reasons you have forests are valued<br>for timber subsoil resources you can<br>guess agriculture and so forth but the<br>ecosystem services that we were talking<br>about here are missing for obvious<br>reasons<br>so there are biased wrong answers but<br>you do get a picture that the trade-off<br>has been consistent with what will be<br>the macro story I've been telling you<br>here which is that we've gone for<br>accumulation of reduced and human<br>capital accumulation of natural capital<br>and the rates of return that exercise I<br>did explain to you that it's just the<br>wrong thing to have done or we've done<br>it to the extent that it's now terribly<br>wrong we ought to not reverse the<br>accumulation process<br>yeah yeah I just wanted to ask for your<br>interpretation of the Schumacher you<br>know the smallest beautiful model and<br>particularly around the intermediate<br>technology he speaks about do you have a<br>view on on his writing his philosophy it<br>seems very similar to yours in some ways<br>well yes the trouble is we can't wish<br>technologies in and one of the things I<br>was trying to point to in far too<br>briefly in my lecture was that in some<br>sense the incentives need to be there<br>for developing intermediate technology<br>or the small-scale technology I mean you<br>didn't need to marker Mothma Gandhi was<br>very much he spent his life promoting<br>small-scale industry you know the hand<br>handle and so forth these ideas have<br>been around for a long while and there's<br>much truth in we need to explore all of<br>this are coming I'm not a card-carrying<br>one thing or the other it's sort of in<br>my last life I must have done something<br>wrong I'm sort of been embedded in<br>trying to detect problems as opposed to<br>coming up with with solutions that's the<br>nature the work I do yeah cura<br>Europe I mean your story is clearly very<br>accurate for the developing world I just<br>wondered if you had any comment on the<br>the tech optimists technology optimists<br>story for the developed world that we're<br>starting to hear is that is that growth<br>has actually decoupled from resource use<br>I just wanted to be had any comments on<br>on you know those sorts of claims thank<br>you very much that's a very good<br>question like the previous ones again<br>the is a matter of the metaphor one<br>reason I highlighted the pollution side<br>the fact that you have to throw back<br>material must balance what you take out<br>in one form or the other degraded form<br>or not has to be put back in there tells<br>me something you know I spent a bit of<br>time discussing the equivalence between<br>pollution and conservation with a<br>different sign of course there was a<br>purpose behind it it says that the idea<br>that in some sense you can produce<br>independent of the biosphere by<br>substituting away indefinitely is really<br>a problematic position to take take this<br>inequality that's already ahead in front<br>hard-boiled technology is going to say<br>oh don't worry about it because if you<br>for any increase of the numerator and Y<br>imagine that technology can come to the<br>rescue by raising out for<br>correspondingly then of course the ratio<br>won't really increase and if alpha can<br>go fast go to infinity faster than NY<br>can then what's the problem the ratio<br>goes to zero so we're very very much in<br>a sustainable world that's the that's<br>what that's always the the question is<br>whether there are about geochemical<br>reasons why alpha can't increase<br>indefinitely some people raise the the<br>second law of thermodynamics to that<br>effect you're just erosion did I won't<br>go that far at all because I don't know<br>the timescale involved I'll go far more<br>to rod geochemical biogeochemical<br>reasons for skepticism that alpha can be<br>raised indefinitely if you ask yourself<br>how many trophic levels there are in an<br>ecosystem you will find at best five I<br>think six may be the maximum that's been<br>observed by trophic levels I mean little<br>you know tiny here about micros and then<br>one lives on the neck the next one lives<br>on the top of that and so forth I think<br>five at best six why why can't there be<br>hundreds and the reason is there is<br>energy loss at every move from the<br>bottom to the next one to the next about<br>ten percent that causes the problem that<br>is the kind of argument<br>I would use to say there are limits to<br>the extent to which alpha in principle<br>can be increased now if alpha is bounded<br>above no matter what no matter how<br>ingenious you are because you have to<br>dump the stuff there and nature would<br>react to that then you have an upper<br>bound on and why if you wish to close<br>the gap between the left-hand side and<br>the right-hand side I'm deeply skeptical<br>of the technological argument because it<br>sort of reminds me I don't mean you I<br>mean because I hear it all the time my<br>mother was a fabulous lady and she and I<br>were great friends but whenever I asked<br>her to explain to me some prop what's a<br>problematic situation how it will pan<br>out she would always say God willing and<br>I feel the technology story is that in<br>the technology will come to our rescue<br>I said well we've got one more question<br>here zero and two questions and then<br>we're done to preach to the soil nice<br>intro yes yeah thanks very much for the<br>talk enjoy it a lot and so thanks really<br>so I've actually a very fundamental<br>question for you you were introduced as<br>a visionary right you were introduced as<br>a visionary in your field right so when<br>we talk about a global biosphere I have<br>a very simple question can this problem<br>be solved by individual governments<br>alone because to me it's logically like<br>a question not possible just as in the<br>climate change debates it's not a<br>national problem lon<br>we're looking at international once goes<br>out saying I delighted over these issues<br>in this lecture as to where the source<br>of decision is going to be as I said I<br>was pointing to the global problem but<br>you're quite right it has to be done at<br>the international level again having<br>said that I know I could correct myself<br>a little bit because it's really not<br>going to be just the International it's<br>this is one area where you see if you<br>like a gradation of institutions<br>starting from the village through the<br>village<br>so you need we need to think I mean in<br>fact on water at each other I'm having a<br>chapter written in the review on that<br>called eccentric institutions which is<br>you have knows which cover group<br>yesterday village you may have<br>households clusters of villages in a in<br>a watershed would have to amalgamate<br>have to have some coordination to manage<br>the watershed then on you lift yourself<br>up as you can see now to higher agree<br>and you need coordination across other<br>groups higher-level groups until you<br>come to the International one I think<br>there's a deep story to be told in<br>political science of the design of<br>institutions by design you don't even<br>you created them but you encourage their<br>formation and so the Village Voice is<br>extremely informative totally important<br>because it's the local biodiversity<br>which is at risk so this is one area<br>where I would the command story of the<br>center or the global economy our global<br>decision-making influencing this problem<br>is deeply problematic it really has to<br>come right from the ground up and then<br>back again<br>thank you very much for your very<br>challenging talk do you think that the<br>language of economics around assets and<br>capitals and productivity and services<br>perpetuates the whole anthropocentric<br>view of the world that is not a natural<br>world centric and also with your<br>equation the end the increasing in is<br>because of increasing life expectancy<br>rather than increasing birth rates which<br>are going down so are you wanting to see<br>drops and life expectancy increasing<br>increasing why is the is the improvement<br>and in poverty getting people out of<br>poverty we will not see that decrease as<br>well so increasing in Y brings with it a<br>lot of challenges just remind me of the<br>first point you made was around the<br>nomenclature that she absolutely<br>absolutely<br>I did take an anthropocentric position<br>here because I talked in terms of prices<br>capital gains but nothing I said is<br>actually anthropocentric in Burien so<br>suppose you had a viewpoint where your<br>animist and you value nature because<br>there's an intrinsic value to nature<br>over and above what it<br>for us that's for sure you can do that<br>and then they still have a asset<br>management problem because you have to<br>live you can be an animist but still<br>you're having to pluck fruit plant trees<br>I'll look after your cattle or goats or<br>whatever it is till the soil so you are<br>managing your assets no matter what but<br>the value impute to the assets of course<br>is now colored by your animism okay so<br>everything I do here in terms of asset<br>management goes through has to go<br>through because the logic of it is<br>independent to the value system you'll<br>be asking was himself you will have a<br>right to ask himself you we should be<br>intelligent enough to ask himself<br>suppose I don't cut the tree down now<br>which I do need for firewood how much<br>what would be the increase in biomass of<br>that tree next year he doesn't use<br>biomass but he says will there be new<br>branches and if you do if you read some<br>of the anthropological literature on<br>local ecosystems management of local<br>ecosystems in Africa they are<br>fascinating their rules and regulations<br>regarding when you can take fruit from a<br>tree when you can take twigs out of the<br>tree for fuel purposes which part of the<br>year it's okay you have enormous ly rich<br>data data that anthropology's have found<br>in coastal regions for coastal fisheries<br>so the extent where a date they say on<br>Wednesdays that's arbitrary certain days<br>of the week you don't fish you this part<br>of the coastline concentrate on that<br>part of the coastline and also depending<br>on the season so they have some notion<br>of the migratory pattern of the fish<br>which is a person asset and the<br>production function is implicit in their<br>thinking now I don't know if they think<br>fish have souls and so forth that's not<br>the point<br>but the point is that I know of no study<br>in which people didn't care about the<br>asset based on which they live because<br>if they didn't they would be dead the<br>mere survival says that they've been<br>very smart tried their best<br>and of course the external environment<br>can collapse to the point where they<br>can't even the best is not good enough<br>that could happen if for example the<br>whole Ireland goes underwater<br>and then so I don't think the octopus<br>centricity has much of an impact here I<br>have a horse concentrated on prices and<br>incomes and GDP and so forth but that's<br>a way of handling our impotence what are<br>we doing through the end to the our<br>activities are affecting the biosphere<br>how do I measure that activity when I<br>took GDP in times like New York right<br>right of course a great deal of the<br>increase in n is due to life expectancy<br>growing up you know this mortality rates<br>going down but let me show you here the<br>UN forecast projection of global<br>population and there it see we are now I<br>mean conceiving details I can say you<br>probably know from 1950 to 2100<br>currently seven point seven billion but<br>they need estimate is ten point two<br>billion in 2100 and in Africa because<br>expand from currently just over a<br>billion to forty or two point eight<br>billion now never mind where there is<br>life expectancy increasing or not the<br>fact is is an overwhelming problem that<br>continent faces its very poor and you<br>have a total fertility rate which is<br>about four point eight now even now and<br>of course they're correcting for changes<br>in total fertility rate so when I talk<br>about T when I mentioned two talked<br>about generations that really does lie<br>at the heart of many of these issues and<br>the more we recognize that the more hope<br>there is that we'll be able to do<br>something to help because we care about<br>gender issues and we should care about<br>gender issues and yet we ignore<br>something very fundamentally important<br>for women I've been influenced in this<br>by the way in a huge way by my daughter<br>young<br>if she she's my co-author so I'm just<br>kind of stuff so she tells me how to<br>think thank you very much can I just<br>note that his mother and his daughter<br>the two guiding lights and everything<br>you understand by the sounds of things<br>happen but it is wonderful I do get a<br>sense that the challenge will be just<br>because it doesn't work in practice<br>doesn't mean it won't work in theory and<br>and it is that practice I'm very very<br>encouraged that conservation is the<br>inducer pollution and it sounds much<br>more fun to focus on conservation than<br>to clean up pollution so I wanted one<br>last round of applause please and thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
