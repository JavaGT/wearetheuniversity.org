faculty his University<br>and to his wider profession so Neil on<br>behalf of the University of Otago I<br>would like to warmly congratulate you on<br>your very well earned promotion to<br>Professor I am very much looking forward<br>to your lecture this evening I will now<br>call on Professor Richard cannon to tell<br>us just a little bit more about Neil's<br>journey to Professor noreda tena koe<br>good evening it's my pleasure to<br>introduce today's speaker Neel Waddell<br>Neel obtained a higher diploma of<br>education from the University of Natal<br>in South Africa and then a master's<br>diploma in dental technology also from<br>Matar Neal worked as a lecturer and<br>senior lecturer in dental technology in<br>Natal and subsequently worked as a<br>technical advisor for a good dental<br>supply company in the early 2000s Neal<br>came to Otago where he gained a post<br>graduate diploma in clinical dental<br>technology and a PhD in which he studied<br>the cause of failure of implant<br>supported over dentures and since then<br>he's risen through the ranks from senior<br>Teaching Fellow through senior lecturer<br>associate professor to a well deserved<br>professorship you're probably familiar<br>with the frontline oral health<br>professionals the dentists the dental<br>therapists and the hygienists but you<br>may be less familiar with the important<br>work that goes on behind the scenes by<br>the dental technologists who make the<br>dentures and other appliances and the<br>biomaterial scientists who develop and<br>test new materials and technologies neil<br>has made major contributions to both<br>dental technology and biomaterial<br>science at Otago Neil has supervised 14<br>masters students and 22 doctoral<br>students and attracted approximately<br>three million dollars in research<br>funding Neil introduced the highly<br>successful annual dental technology<br>research day in 2006 and is currently<br>the director of the biomechanics and<br>biomaterials research program in the Sir<br>John Walsh Research Institute Faculty of<br>Dentistry and he is head of the<br>discipline of dental biomaterials Neal<br>has expertise in the areas of implant<br>over dentures dental materials<br>maxillofacial and ocular prosthetics and<br>crown and bridge ceramic restorations<br>Neal conducts research in dental<br>materials craniofacial biomechanics<br>including bite forces<br>prosthetic failure mechanisms adhesion<br>of dental materials sub-concussive brain<br>injury research in vitro modeling of<br>blunt force trauma forensic odontology<br>wounding and ballistic blood spatter<br>analysis and development of simulant<br>materials for forensic modeling the list<br>goes on and I'm sure Neil will touch on<br>several of these areas this evening and<br>I'm looking forward very much to hearing<br>Neil's presentation on oral micro<br>engineering so please join me in<br>welcoming Neil to the lectern<br>vice-chancellor thank you very much for<br>those kind words Richard thank you for<br>watching those kind words and thank you<br>very much everyone for coming tonight<br>and I'm hoping to give you a bit of a<br>flavor of my journey here and my walk at<br>the University of Targa and my title are<br>all micro engineering to give you some<br>insights into the engineering side of<br>the biomechanics and biomaterials that<br>we carry out to restore people's<br>dentition and towards the end we'll<br>switch focus and look at some of the<br>sub-concussive brain injury research<br>just to change the flavour as such so a<br>little bit about myself I was born in a<br>country called Rhodesia in central<br>southern Africa way back in 1954 and in<br>a town called Bulawayo and a feature of<br>that town is the very wide streets and<br>that top right-hand little image there<br>is of an ox wagon which was the former<br>transport in those days when the country<br>was first formed in 1890 and you had to<br>be able to do a u-turn with a span of<br>oxen of ten to twelve pairs in the<br>street hence the wide streets so that's<br>a town that I was born in but I actually<br>grew up most of my time in the capital<br>city which was called souls breathing<br>and a feature again in the wide streets<br>but another feature was all the streets<br>were lined with Jacaranda trees and at<br>that time of the year there was this<br>glorious color of purple throughout the<br>city and as the little flowers would<br>fall we'd have<br>in a map of purple and as you wrote down<br>the streets you hear the little popping<br>of the flowers as we are sort of heading<br>into work so on leaving school I went<br>and joined the army the first Battalion<br>rhodesia regiment at the time Rhodesia<br>was fighting a war on two fronts from<br>Mozambique Robert Mugabe Zipporah forces<br>with North Korean trained and Communist<br>Chinese trained and backed and there was<br>a war net front and on the northern<br>front we had Joshua and coma and his<br>forces and they were East German and<br>Russian trains so there was a war taking<br>place at the time and then in 1976 I did<br>selection for the SAS will see Rhodesia<br>squadron 22 SAS regiment and the<br>background of the SAS is that in the<br>Second World War a gentleman by the name<br>of David Stirling formed the SAS and<br>they were the first sort of Special<br>Forces where they went behind enemy<br>lines and caused as much trouble as they<br>could and at the end of the war although<br>they were very successful they were<br>disestablished when the Malayan campaign<br>came along the Commonwealth decided to<br>resurrect the SAS and New Zealand formed<br>a squadron<br>she's our current New Zealand SAS which<br>they sent Australia formed a squadron<br>which they sent and they are still<br>current today and the British formed a B<br>C and D squadron and C squadron was<br>drawn from soldiers from Rhodesia and so<br>as I say I did selection there was 120<br>of us started and six of us made it that<br>particular round and for the rest of the<br>years in from 1980<br>I played soldiers with the SAS but in<br>1980 things changed there was a<br>political agreement to stop the war and<br>the country became Zimbabwe and Robert<br>Mugabe became the president so I and a<br>third of the squadron left within six<br>weeks and we were absorbed into one<br>reconnaissance commando which was the<br>South African Special Forces equivalent<br>unit and they were based in Durban and<br>that's I ended up in Durban South Africa<br>but the novelty of playing soldiers had<br>worn off pretty quickly and a year later<br>I left and I went off and became a<br>dental technician and that's when life<br>changed and it was a different type of<br>yeah enjoyment and then so in 1984 I was<br>successful when I applied for a position<br>to teach as a lecturer in the dental<br>technology department a technique on the<br>towel and they offered a four year<br>higher diploma in dental technology and<br>the images you see there on the right<br>hand side some images of the<br>laboratories where students would have a<br>workstation each and would learn how to<br>make teeth and then in 1997 I and my<br>family and you can see in the top left<br>hand side the three children<br>we then immigrated from South Africa to<br>New Zealand and I was appointed as a<br>senior lecturer at the Central Institute<br>of Technology where they had a three<br>year deployment dental technology and I<br>started teaching there and the top<br>little right hand image shows you the<br>teaching laboratories where we taught<br>students and the bottom one is a aerial<br>view of the campus at the time but much<br>to my shock within three weeks the<br>then-ceo professor Michael Cooper got us<br>all together the staff and said oh by<br>the way the government is now going to<br>disestablish CIT over the next couple of<br>years so anyway I was offered a job in<br>Australia and the prospects were short<br>term at the CIT and so we moved to<br>Australia where I was a technical<br>adviser for a big Australian based<br>dental supply company and we were based<br>out of Sydney and my time and the supply<br>company industry was great but I really<br>missed academia and I was very very<br>pleased when I was successful in my<br>application to come back into the<br>academic tertiary world again and I was<br>appointed as a senior Teaching Fellow to<br>start the new Bachelor dental technology<br>degree that was just starting up here at<br>Otago so professor Peterson his wisdom<br>at the time had seemed to incorporate or<br>to bring under the umbrella of the<br>faculty<br>all the different components of the<br>dental team and we were the last members<br>of the team to to come into the faculty<br>and as Richard explained the dental<br>technicians are the unseen side of the<br>industry we are the technical people who<br>quietly make the teeth and the<br>prostheses etc and have very little<br>contact with patients apart from maybe<br>taking color and shade of teeth etc and<br>that was the start of my career<br>professor Innes had put in place the<br>Bachelor of dental technology and the<br>post graduate diploma and clinical<br>dental technology and when I came on<br>board and was head of the discipline I<br>didn't put in place the post graduate<br>diploma of dental technology leading<br>through to the master's degree in dental<br>technology and then later my colleague<br>Jon Artz put in place the honours<br>Bachelor of dental technology with<br>honors and that is now given several<br>pathways and I'm pleased to say we have<br>a very vibrant postgraduate program at<br>all the different levels and for our<br>undergrads to then have options to go<br>into and this has paid dividends for our<br>program and many of the pictures I'll<br>show you have staff and postgraduate<br>students are actually graduates from<br>those programs and so here's a picture<br>of one of the teaching labs in the Sir<br>John Walsh which is now being<br>refurbished and it always amuses me that<br>we call them dental laboratories because<br>they're actually manufacturing<br>facilities they don't look anything like<br>a typical laboratory ok so moving on we<br>talk about standing on the shoulders of<br>giants I need to acknowledge these three<br>gentlemen who have been instrumental in<br>my career in academia just t6 the first<br>is dr. doodsen he supervised me through<br>my masters a technic on the town and he<br>was the one who passed on the passion<br>for research and I have a great debt of<br>gratitude to him and then when I did my<br>PhD the other two gentleman professor<br>Mike Swain and professor Jules Kizer had<br>an immense influence on my understanding<br>and my sort of school of thought and my<br>think<br>Mike taught me the importance of<br>understand the simple before you build a<br>simple block on a simple block to get to<br>the complex because if you haven't<br>understood the basic simple component<br>you've got no chance of explaining the<br>more complex and jewel sadly has gone to<br>his wrist but Jules is instrumental in<br>opening up the understanding of working<br>is part of a team that several people<br>bring in the expertise together can<br>achieve far more than you can by<br>yourself and also he was the master of<br>networking and I've tried to emulate<br>some of that as my career is going on<br>also three other gentlemen I want to<br>really acknowledge that in the recent<br>years these three were at Duncan Darryl<br>Tong and Carl Lyons have mentored me in<br>my sort of time moving up through the<br>ranks and I really wish to thank them<br>personally the bread of debt of<br>gratitude to them for how they've helped<br>me in my progression and sort of passing<br>on their knowledge and tips and I hope<br>in some way to do the same for those who<br>are coming up behind me so the theme of<br>what I'm gonna be saying tonight is this<br>working as part of a team all of my<br>publications on multiple author<br>publications I have not published once<br>by myself<br>and what I've learnt is that when a<br>group of good people come together you<br>can achieve much and so these are<br>colleagues and past colleagues that I<br>have put up on the screen and I'm not<br>going to name them all but there's three<br>I want to signal now and that's the<br>three at the bottom left there our<br>professional staff without their support<br>I think things would grind to a halt and<br>nanosecond if we didn't have dedicated<br>professional people and I just want to<br>name them Bruce McClendon he was a<br>master of knowing where things were who<br>could do what how you could get things<br>done and I need a little bit of<br>something made for a jig or something<br>like that and in early days we didn't<br>have much research funding at that stage<br>and I go to Bruce and say who could make<br>this device me and he would tell me that<br>there's a little workshop there were<br>some one day and he just knew it<br>but he was and he was an immense help to<br>support us getting going in the early<br>days like that<br>Liz Gervin she in my opinion has an<br>advanced part nice pilot's license to<br>fly strike drive the scanning electron<br>microscopes that are under her control<br>and a large part of the research that we<br>have been involved in is involved<br>electron microscopy and liz has been<br>instrumental in us achieving results in<br>that area and then finally Leo van<br>Raines who is the instrument technician<br>under the Linda Fergus and down and the<br>dungeon in the basement there he's<br>skilled as an instrument maker and his<br>knowledge and precision has enabled us<br>he produces world-class quality jigs etc<br>and then what can I say without our post<br>graduates and our honors students<br>we wouldn't achieve a fraction of what<br>we achieve and so as I talk about what<br>the research areas that I'm going to<br>talk about tonight please it's always<br>I'm going to use the word we and our<br>groups etc because it's all of us in the<br>various groups that have managed to<br>so it's didn't do some research<br>understanding bite forces is really<br>important because it has huge<br>implications for the materials we select<br>and for the restorations we design your<br>methods of mastication are extremely<br>powerful and literally if you put your<br>finger in the back your mouth and give<br>it a nip you can in a lot of damage<br>there as Mike Tyson did deep oral<br>what's-his-name's here then the<br>Holyfield so we have a natural mechanism<br>and the good Lord above created us with<br>this marvelous system called the<br>proprioceptive nerve feedback from our<br>teeth so that when we bite down hard<br>each tooth sends a signal through the<br>nerves back to the brain and says listen<br>stop biting now it's getting so and in<br>that way we don't overload our teeth we<br>don't smash them up per se and this is<br>great because when we restore teeth in<br>other senses here and they sit on<br>natural and<br>there is a periodontal membrane which<br>has got like a cushioning effect as well<br>as the nerves and so we don't tend to<br>overload these teeth too much but with<br>the advent of implants that we've had<br>over the last 20 plus years in this<br>instance here now there's no nerve<br>feedback because the nerves are gone and<br>the implant is osteo integrated into the<br>bone and so we don't have any cushioning<br>effect here and so while failures are<br>not that common in the mouth they do<br>occur and so we need to understand these<br>bite forces and these mechanisms of<br>failure if we want to then understand<br>what caused them and avoid them going<br>forward in the future<br>so one of our groups has been looking at<br>this issue of contact point stresses on<br>teeth and restorations and if I read the<br>title of the publication here's maximum<br>voluntary bite force and the voluntary<br>is that pain feedback so when you bite<br>to the max that tells you stop binding<br>now occlusal contact points and<br>associated stresses on posterior teeth<br>and I've used two words their force and<br>stress and so what do we mean by this<br>word force and stress so we take the<br>elephant on the right it is a large mass<br>and force is defined by mass times<br>acceleration so is it trundles down the<br>road the mass with the speed at which it<br>puts its foot down<br>is distributed across the base of the<br>pad of its foot and that's the area to<br>which it's subjected and so forces sort<br>of say stress is the force divided by<br>the surface area to which it's applied<br>and conversely the little deer which is<br>a fraction of the mass of the elephant<br>but when it trots down the same Road the<br>size of its hooves is very small and so<br>now when you take the area to which the<br>force is applied it will produce a<br>higher stress than the elephant and it<br>will imprint into that so in engineering<br>terms we use stress to look at the<br>strength of materials so what we did as<br>a group as we threw much experimentation<br>I must say develop this bite force<br>transducer frame and the experiments<br>that went into finding the right metals<br>and configurations was was extensive and<br>to that we had<br>two strain gauges which measure then<br>electronically any distortion in the<br>system and once we had come up with the<br>design we then went to our universal<br>testing machine where we could then<br>apply forces to it and correlate that to<br>the voltage output from the strain<br>gauges and then say right this output<br>gives us amount of force and I'm using<br>the word force here and once we had<br>achieved that we then cast or produced<br>in metal the upper and lower teeth which<br>we then again put into our universal<br>testing machine where we could then put<br>it into that and ensure that we were<br>getting tooth to tooth contact because<br>we wanted to measure individual teeth<br>and not of group of teeth and having<br>calibrated that we went to clinical<br>trial phase where we had a significant<br>number of volunteers induced with a<br>little Cod to New World<br>thank you very much but we were able now<br>to measure the bite force on the<br>individual teeth in the posterior of the<br>mouth and once we had done that within<br>scanned using laser scanning technology<br>say the upper and lower teeth and this<br>gives a three-dimensional output and<br>that allows us in in the computer such<br>to then calculate the surface areas of<br>these contact points and contact areas<br>and once you know the force and once you<br>know the area to which it's applied you<br>can calculate the stress and of the 174<br>teeth that we measured 21.8% we're<br>producing stressors above a thousand two<br>hundred mega Pascal's and the reason<br>that that's a significant number is the<br>most or the strongest material that we<br>use as an all ceramic and restoring the<br>mouth as a flexural strength and 1,200<br>mega man mega Pascal's which is a stress<br>value so that's telling us that in terms<br>of designing and selecting materials to<br>go into the posterior or the your back<br>teeth it's really important that we know<br>what are the bite forces strike the<br>stresses on the contact points and we<br>design and select accordingly and this<br>informed us in terms of our treat<br>planning and designing what we're going<br>to do so another area we looked at as a<br>group was what is the influence of these<br>forces on the teeth and various implant<br>retention systems and also on flexible<br>flexibility of the mandible so we came<br>up with a in vitro simulation where we<br>took the methyls muscles of mastication<br>as bungee cords but we attached them to<br>the right attachment points in the mouth<br>and if you look very carefully here<br>you'll see a load cell down here and we<br>could swing that and an arc to the<br>different teeth and in that way when we<br>raise the frame of the testing machine<br>the bungees were then left a certain<br>amount of force and that would then be<br>reflected on this output that you see<br>over here and we could then and induce<br>on an individual tooth an amount of bite<br>force and then attach to the mandible we<br>had a whole lot of strain gauges in all<br>different places allowing us to then<br>measure the flexibility of the mandible<br>what was flexing away as well as things<br>like should we screw retain or cement<br>retain so up here you see these little<br>screws going in and there you can see<br>the screw holes and down here there's no<br>screw holes that's what we call cement<br>retained so when you screw something<br>together you have a thing called<br>compliance there's a certain amount of<br>movement and given the pin in the<br>combination of the screws but when you<br>cement retain its rigid and depending on<br>the flexing of the mandible when you are<br>loading it<br>you can then rupture that cement<br>attachment of that cement bond and that<br>becomes the weak link in the system so<br>we were able to study this as well as<br>using very stiff materials like zirconia<br>which is very very rigid this is more<br>ductile systems like dental alloys that<br>you see on the right so this combination<br>of variables and I we were enabled to<br>then using this in vitro approach look<br>at do we cement retain do we screw<br>retain do we use metallic systems like<br>you see here or ceramic systems like you<br>see here and that enabled us to then<br>inform that type of treatment planning<br>we not only look at<br>closing forces bite forces but also jaw<br>opening forces and we have a group<br>investigating this area led by Professor<br>Brunton and that helps to inform things<br>like temporal mandibular joint<br>dysfunction things like that and so we<br>have a group measuring that as well so<br>all aspects of the biomechanics of<br>what's taking place in terms of<br>mastication or your jaw and etc we are<br>or have done investigated that so what<br>about things going wrong and one of the<br>things we do is we look at how engineers<br>do an analysis of failure and we tried<br>to apply similar types of principles to<br>failure in the mouth and one of the<br>areas we looked at was the failure of<br>soldier bar attachment systems and<br>implant over dentures and what was<br>happening at the time as we were running<br>clinical trials on attachments to help<br>stabilize these complete dentures and in<br>some cases we had ball attachments like<br>this and another's we had bars and they<br>were looking to see which were the most<br>effective but the problem was that some<br>of these bars were failing at the solder<br>joint after one or two years and their<br>life span should have been 10 to 12<br>years and why were they failing and<br>here's another example of a similar sort<br>of failure and so here's a photograph of<br>one of the failures and I'm just going<br>to alert you to this gray area here and<br>the gray area here and keep that the<br>back in mind we'll come back to that so<br>taking the failed bars and and and and<br>components off to the scanning electron<br>microscope we're having a very close<br>look was very interesting we saw<br>extensive corrosion and the solder<br>joints being undermined by corrosion as<br>well as corrosion attacking the gold<br>cylinder this is an oxidizing gold<br>cylinder of pure platinum palladium and<br>gold and from this defects were being<br>induced that we were seeing stress<br>corrosion cracking and this appeared to<br>be the initiation of failure of these<br>joints we also observed in some failures<br>fatigue failure and we were able to<br>establish that by these little<br>striations you see here which are signs<br>of fatigue every time you buy<br>and you open up biting you open up you<br>leave behind a little liner but like the<br>rings on a tree when you're aged a tree<br>so we model that using a mathematical<br>model to look at the different designs<br>in terms of a rounded sort of connection<br>or a straight connection and as well as<br>looking at the internal types of<br>stresses and this sort of helped us<br>focus or imagine where these stresses<br>will be focused was it to do with design<br>or materials and it helps to then start<br>to understand on a bigger picture of<br>where the stresses are focused and where<br>the potential causes could be and what<br>was also interesting we found inside<br>these failed cylinders corrosion caused<br>by crevice corrosion so some of these<br>stresses you see here an extra fact the<br>failure had been initiated inside the<br>implant from corrosion as well as on the<br>outside so running parallel to this the<br>group took some original components a<br>bar that you see over here and a gold<br>cylinder and a solder here and this is<br>shown as a bar they the solder and the<br>gold cylinders down here and we then<br>solder them together polished them up<br>went to the scanning electron microscope<br>and at the same time we took them in and<br>nano indented them these little Indians<br>you see you running here allow us to<br>measure the modulus of elasticity which<br>are stiffness and the hardness of the<br>various components across the joint and<br>what we found was that just inside the<br>edge of the cylinder was a grey zone<br>that we observed and when we looked at<br>its hardness and modulus it was<br>significantly higher than the rest of<br>the components of the system and this<br>was quite interesting so running<br>parallel to that we said well let's<br>fatigue cycle these you know in the<br>aircraft industry when a plane falls out<br>the sky they will often do these types<br>of tests and so we ran to in the dry<br>environment and to in a whit corrosive<br>environment and we cycled these until<br>they failed and at different stages we<br>were able to take them out look at the<br>under the microscope see the progress<br>and what was taking place until we got<br>failure of the solar dream and once they<br>failed we then embedded them and again<br>cut them through so we cut them length<br>yeah lengthwise like this and then<br>polished them up to look under the<br>microscope and what was interesting was<br>that this gray zone here has got the<br>crack in it and so what we found was the<br>cracks were initiating in the solder<br>often through corrosion but once they<br>reached the cylinder it would be a rapid<br>propagation down there through this gray<br>zone and the question is what is it<br>about this zone that is causing the<br>crack to in a catastrophic way propagate<br>down so we made up beams and in the beam<br>we incorporate some of the non oxidizing<br>gold cylinder on one side and the solder<br>on the other and this is what we call a<br>fracture toughness test so we not yet<br>here to induce the crack to the<br>direction and the ear we want the crack<br>to occur and we loaded in a three point<br>Bend and then once we break it we are<br>able to calculate the fracture toughness<br>and sure enough the surface topography<br>showed us a brittle mode type failure<br>so it was brittle as opposed to ductile<br>weeds expect to see the metal and we<br>found the fracture toughness was the<br>same as that of zirconia so<br>inadvertently the soldering process was<br>creating a ceramic like brittle zone<br>within a ductile metal system and once a<br>crack reached it there was a<br>catastrophic failure and this was<br>confirmed when we did the elemental<br>analysis using EDS and what we were<br>finding was that when the solder was<br>soldered to the bar which was a type<br>four gold alloy they contained similar<br>elements and there was equilibrium there<br>was no movement but when it was soldered<br>to the non oxidizing gold cylinder<br>platinum palladium are very reactive<br>especially a temperature and the gold<br>platinum palladium was migrating out<br>diffusing out into the solder and copper<br>zinc and silver was migrating inwards<br>forming this grey zone and this was this<br>brittle zone that we were inadvertently<br>creating so we came up with a solution<br>to the problem<br>don't use non oxidizing gold cylinders<br>to solder bar attachment systems you you<br>instead order the plastic one and you<br>face a sprue under the plastic which is<br>in Bern<br>in a furnace and cast it through a<br>casting process and then you go ahead<br>and solder your gold bars to your skull<br>cylinders which has now been cast and<br>you keep the preformed on oxidizing gold<br>cylinders for laser welding type<br>situations where you don't have long<br>heat exposure or thermal cycles now when<br>we sort of found the answer to that<br>problem new problems were arising and<br>this was a chipping or failure of the<br>bond of porcelain to zirconia<br>substructures and at the same time to<br>cobalt chrome which is a metal<br>substructure so what was happening was<br>that the industry had been promoting the<br>use of zirconia as a new material with<br>CAD cam type manufacturing processes and<br>worldwide reports were coming in that<br>the porcelain was chipping off at the<br>same time the gold price the precious<br>metal place had we gone skyrocketing up<br>through the roof and the whole world was<br>switching away from Noble based alloys<br>to cobalt chrome and likewise we were<br>doing the same here and we were finding<br>problems with the veneering porcelains<br>chipping away from it so before I go<br>into more detail on that let's try and<br>give you an insight as to how we veneer<br>porcelain to these sub structures sewed<br>up here is a metal framework that we wax<br>up and cast now that could be metal or<br>it could be a ceramic like zirconia yeah<br>it's just the framework and in each<br>stage we put a layer of porcelains on<br>which we then fire and one of these<br>furnaces - 930 degrees centigrade and<br>there's a series of firings as we go<br>through because the portion of shrinks<br>when we put it on and it can have up to<br>sort of eight firings depending on the<br>size of the restoration so just to show<br>you an example here's a case where you<br>have a central and a central lateral and<br>the canine now your two front teeth and<br>the one next to it and your canine<br>there's the old ceramic zirconia<br>substructure been tried in the mouth<br>back on the costs to the dental<br>aggression now we're going to make it<br>that's the first layer has been fired on<br>and then we start to lay these<br>porcelains<br>which are powder mixed with a liquid and<br>we take a paintbrush and we start to<br>build up the different colors<br>translucency zits like painting with<br>glass and this is slowly built up until<br>we get the shapes and the nuances of<br>color in the right places and once it<br>then reaches the size we want we<br>slightly ever build it because of the<br>shrinkage then we take it to the furnace<br>and we fire it it'll shrink as you see<br>it shrunk down and then we'll put the<br>next layer on and again when we get it<br>to the say p1 we fire that again and<br>this is what you see if the job has been<br>well done there's your central your<br>central your lateral your canine so some<br>very beautiful work by dental ceramics<br>in that case now this next little video<br>is very short but it'll give you an<br>insight as to how we build these crowns<br>and it's from a manufacturing publicity<br>web and you'll notice on the side here<br>the different types of teeth and we can<br>make old teeth young teeth ugly teeth<br>beautiful teeth once we know what the<br>patient's teeth look like we can match<br>it by layering in these different layers<br>of porcelains and enamels and<br>translucency colors and so what's<br>showing you here in 50 seconds as an<br>extra effect would take probably an hour<br>and a half to two hours for a ceramist<br>to make one of these teeth<br>and at each stage each of these will<br>have had at least five if not more<br>firings thermal cycle through one of<br>those porcelain furnaces so this<br>porcelain was chipping off and patients<br>aren't happy when the beautiful teeth<br>they have start to fail so we put the<br>word out to the dentists in New Zealand<br>and said please if you've got one of<br>these akhirnya veneered situations<br>please send it to us that we can do an<br>analysis of failure and dr. erin collins<br>up and walked and very kindly sent us<br>this one and here you can just see the<br>chip on this little edge here and that's<br>a coated ready to go into the electron<br>microscope we also did a micro CT scan<br>on it and this here shows you the<br>surface and using fracked ography which<br>is a science in itself we can track back<br>from the different areas to the source<br>of the failure and we're even able to<br>sort of calculate the sort of forces<br>involved in initiating that failure and<br>the first thing that we sort of realized<br>as the group looked at this and that was<br>that the thermal conductivity that's the<br>rate at which heat is transferred<br>through a material of the veneering<br>porcelains here was very similar to the<br>zirconia and that has huge implications<br>to the cooling when it comes out of the<br>furnace if you look at metals 315<br>compared to that they will lose the heat<br>at a much more rapid rate and likewise<br>you see the aluminium oxides and the<br>implications of this is that when the<br>crown comes out of the furnace it's<br>losing the heat through the in the case<br>of a metal from the inside to the<br>outside so as it's contracting and<br>cooling it goes from a liquid because<br>the porcelain is got to be fired and<br>enamel to a solid it's solidifying from<br>the inside out but in the case of these<br>akhirnya it's losing heat equally both<br>from the outside and the inside and the<br>result of that is that if you fast cool<br>it and all the manufacturers had a fast<br>cooling cycle as part of the recommended<br>procedure what happens is the pourcel in<br>the middle which is still liquid now<br>cannot contract and sets up an area of<br>tension inside the porcelain and this<br>was the cause of the cracking<br>the chipping that was taking place and<br>to validate that we took tablets of<br>porcelain and we put thermocouples one<br>in the center and one on the outside and<br>we heated it up until the two and now at<br>the same temperature and this was above<br>the glass transition of the porcelain<br>and then we cooled them at different<br>rates and when we cool it quickly this<br>little area in the middle here is the<br>glass transition you can see that the<br>outside reaches the glass transition<br>before the inside and that sets up this<br>residual stress of tension in the middle<br>of the porcelain but when we cooled it<br>slowly we didn't get that situation and<br>you don't get the residual stress and we<br>moved to publish this very quickly<br>because this was still a worldwide<br>problem and a Targa was instrumental in<br>the manufacturers worldwide changing<br>their firing cycles to include a slow<br>cool cycle on the last thermal cycle of<br>the firing of the porcelains when you<br>veneer it and the manufacturers are very<br>grateful to us because dentistry was<br>about to walk away from zirconia because<br>of these failures and we were able to<br>say hey listen here's the solution to<br>the problem you can keep using it now in<br>all research you think you're solving<br>one question but you come up with<br>another four or five questions that you<br>know what about this and what about that<br>and one of the questions was what is the<br>influence of the thickness of the<br>porcelain that we're veneering in terms<br>of the cooling cycles on the residual<br>stresses and as I said we were using<br>cobalt chrome and we were using all<br>ceramics and that's why I've shown<br>here's a metal substructure and there's<br>an all ceramic substructure so look into<br>the old ceramic we use indentations so<br>we take this little Vickers diamond it's<br>got a set shape and we indent it into<br>the surface of the porcelain and you see<br>these little cracks and when you have a<br>situation of no residual stress<br>underneath the area you correct the<br>cracks have nothing to inhibit it so<br>they extend further but if underneath<br>that area you're indenting there is<br>tension and the underlying porcelain<br>it's trying to hold it together it's a<br>bit like a reinforced windscreen a<br>toughened windscreen then the cracks are<br>inhibited from extending and there's a<br>formula that we then use to convert that<br>to residual stress<br>and then using a matrix like this we<br>were able to build different thicknesses<br>of porcelain and then fire them then go<br>in and dent them at different places<br>that you see here and then able to<br>report the influence of the veneer too<br>thick or too thin what's the what's the<br>repercussions of them and so again it<br>informs us in terms of how we produce<br>crowns and design their sub structures<br>coming to the cobalt chrome side what we<br>were seeing was a failure at the<br>porcelain to metal interface where<br>porcelain was breaking away and what we<br>found was that when we used electron<br>backscatter diffraction do you look at<br>what was going on at the surfaces what<br>you see here is a point five of a<br>millimeter and a one millimeter<br>thickness so this area here would be<br>that thickness and we then placed<br>porcelain on top of it the little green<br>area you see at the top is the porcelain<br>and that represents a serious oh there's<br>a porcelain on top of the metal and we<br>then fired it and fired it and fire it<br>simulating when the crown has been first<br>firing SiC and firing etc and we found<br>that the phases were changing and it was<br>starting to form this phase at the top<br>which had different mechanical<br>properties and was very rigid so when<br>the bilayer of the porcelain the metal<br>are contracting together<br>it was setting up these residual<br>stresses and this was quite serious but<br>at the same time the manufacturers were<br>launching different technologies ie<br>powder metallurgy and CAD CAM mold and<br>also in cobalt chrome and I researched<br>in looking at that showed us that with<br>these types of approaches we were not<br>getting that secondary phase forming on<br>the multiple firings and I'm pleased to<br>say this inform the school when we then<br>purchased our CAD cam milling system and<br>all of our sub structures are now<br>produced with the powder metallurgy<br>component okay let's change focus if we<br>keep going with teeth that may become a<br>little bit boring so<br>so research involved in sub-concussive<br>brain injury using a forensic head model<br>one of the things as dental technicians<br>is that we have that ability to make<br>molds use different materials and we're<br>always trying to make prosthesis these<br>are a couple of cases that I've done in<br>the past just to illustrate this ability<br>to use simulant materials to replace<br>lost structures etc so how did a bunch<br>of dentists and dental technicians get<br>involved in research on sub-concussive<br>brain injury we need to track back a<br>little bit in the story we were asked to<br>develop a skin skull brain model for<br>forensic ballistic testing and how this<br>came about Jules had an extensive<br>network and had a active research<br>forensic research group running and dr.<br>Michael Taylor who was an international<br>blood spatter expert and he is a<br>scientist with the ESR so when the<br>police have a homicide they Colin dr.<br>Taylor as the forensic scientists to do<br>the investigation and his colleague Mike<br>Walsh have given Walsh sorry he was the<br>ballistic expert they asked us to make a<br>skinned skull brain model that they<br>could then do research on that<br>now the other members a team Daryl and<br>Warwick and Jules you'll see the black<br>here and myself had a military<br>background and so we immediately knew<br>what it was about and were able to then<br>bring our knowledge and expertise as<br>well we invited in professor mark Jamie<br>he was a expert in fluid dynamics from<br>the University of Canterbury mechanical<br>engineering and of course Mike Swain and<br>as our physicist and one of the things<br>that Jules had observed in these<br>forensic call-outs that he was having to<br>do and by the way there's many of our<br>colleagues at the school who are part of<br>the DVI team disaster victim<br>identification who get called in to help<br>with the investigation of the analysis<br>of these situations and so we were well<br>placed to sort of look at this so how do<br>we get rupturing of the skin from<br>blunt-force trauma<br>now the next little clip I'm going to<br>show you one of our post grads did<br>without our permission we didn't know<br>she was gonna do it but when you see her<br>she's going to punch yourself but look<br>at the area from the punch and the shock<br>wave that moves out from there that's<br>quite important to understand that if<br>she'd asked us we'd have said noses but<br>it's very revealing in the same time and<br>this was in front of the high-speed<br>camera so using silicone as a skin and a<br>sponge we were then able to impact this<br>and while it is dry there's no fluid in<br>the sponge you can impact it as many<br>times as you want nothing changes it<br>elastically recovers fully the moment<br>you hydrate the sponge you get a totally<br>different reaction the hydrostatic<br>pressures are such that as you impact it<br>it cannot escape and what happens then<br>is the underlying tissue ruptures and<br>the skin ruptures and effectively it's<br>rupturing from the inside outwards<br>because of the hydrostatic pressures<br>from the blunt force trauma and we were<br>able to correlate this with post-mortem<br>evidence and again let's say we were<br>successful in publishing this and from<br>this dr. Mike Taylor he was doing all of<br>this research on blood spatter the media<br>said well can we make this can we make<br>that and so we made up a fist for him<br>and here he is using the first and what<br>they do is they then study how the blood<br>moves what direction it goes and and<br>they're able to do a whole lot of<br>calculations from that we even made a<br>stabbing device for him to study that<br>there it is in the molds etc and so he's<br>now able to attach this to a drop swing<br>device where he can have repeatability<br>and take all the various measurements<br>that he needs to do for the biomechanics<br>and then study the effects of that on a<br>repeatable in-vitro basis etc so the<br>area that he was really interested in<br>was this issue of ballistic impact to<br>the head and the back spatter from there<br>and what they find at scenes is that if<br>someone has shot themselves there will<br>always be tissue on the hand and tissue<br>on the weapon and if they go to<br>investigate what potentially is a<br>suicide and they don't find any back<br>spatter on the hand that implies that<br>was planted and what was potentially<br>suicide now becomes a homicide<br>investigation and likewise if it's not<br>on the gun in where is the weapon that<br>did it it's sort of disappeared and so<br>using our dental skills molding skills<br>we then created a basic skin skull brain<br>and this shows you a bullet impacting it<br>that was our first prototype we found<br>that the reasons we are using which is<br>the same reasons we used for the<br>mandible which have the same mechanical<br>properties as bone we're showing correct<br>results but our design didn't include<br>the cerebral spinal fluid and it didn't<br>have the hydrated tissue component so we<br>readjusted our model to incorporate that<br>using glycerol as the liquid which we<br>could then pigment with a color and the<br>next one I'm going to show you is a<br>little movie but it's a transparent<br>movies it's not encased inside the the<br>the skull per se weather or the reason<br>skull but it illustrates what we're<br>trying to investigate so bullet will<br>come in from the right in a minute<br>you'll see ejection of tissue matter in<br>the direction that it's come and then<br>you see the chipra cavity is formed and<br>now that starts to collapse you'll see a<br>further ejection of blood and tissue<br>matter in the direction that the bullet<br>came and this is what causes this next<br>better that they find on the hand and on<br>the gun and so it was to investigate<br>this that it was so important that you<br>know we made this for dr. Mike Taylor to<br>do his investigations now resulting from<br>this the defense Academy in United<br>Kingdom picked up on this model that we<br>had produced and said well could we come<br>across and give it to them and so we<br>went across and all four of Jule's<br>Darryl Warrick and myself had been<br>across they at different times and we've<br>been instrumental in helping them design<br>helmet systems in through the using our<br>model and here's a cool little<br>photograph of Warrick standing with Deb<br>Deborah Carr Deborah formerly was here<br>at Otago as an engineer with textiles<br>and she worked for the implant sorry the<br>impact<br>I'm a group at the defense academy so<br>when all of this came to an end we said<br>okay let's change the focus Darryl was<br>very involved in the sub concussion side<br>and we said okay let's change the focus<br>use this knowledge we've built up with<br>our simulant model and directed more at<br>sub concussion so definition complex of<br>this of concussion that is a complex<br>pathophysiological price is affected the<br>brain induced by traumatic biomechanical<br>factors and our interest isn't the<br>biomechanics side of it and we've all<br>seen these sickening images of sportsmen<br>being injured and in the field<br>but the problem was that when they don't<br>show symptoms of concussion it's sub<br>concussion it's below the threshold they<br>keep playing and so we don't know much<br>about it this carry on mentality is a<br>problem the injuries we believe are now<br>cumulative and evidence is now coming<br>out that it is the case and you know we<br>starting to see the long-term effects<br>and so we wanted to know could we study<br>this find out what are the harmful<br>thresholds and what is it that we could<br>set up safety study and can we measure<br>it in a safe way and animal models are<br>not appropriate because the anatomy is<br>totally different and in vivo studies<br>are not really appropriate either yeah<br>we don't go around and bang each other<br>on the head with a hammer or whatever it<br>might be that's not quite right either<br>so we commenced the process and we said<br>okay well one of the mechanical<br>properties of the scalp and one of our<br>first medius honor students Nick Peter<br>his project was to now run around the<br>dental school and find as many victims<br>as he could and use this little device<br>called a durometer and measure the sraw<br>hardness on various places on their<br>scalp and sorry just to go back to that<br>and we correlated this with different<br>elastomers and medium-bodied<br>polyvinyl siloxane happens to have a<br>similar mechanical property as that of<br>the mean value<br>of the of the scalp and we fear that<br>took these different silicones that we<br>have and we subjected them to continuous<br>impact because the model had to be able<br>to withstand repeatable use whereas if<br>you hit someone on the head and they<br>skin it injures first time you don't<br>keep hitting the same place but model we<br>couldn't keep building a new model every<br>time and so we then tested the<br>properties and again we found that our<br>is my mouse here okay<br>the medium-bodied polyvinyl siloxane was<br>similar to in this case pig skin which<br>we just gone down to new world and got<br>some of and again we were able to then<br>publish the outcomes this then led to<br>what impact for should we use and low<br>and behold we had a significant number<br>about ten practitioners of the sport of<br>kendo in the school at the time and<br>Daryl was the black belt leader of the<br>group and you may have wondered why<br>speculate that his hair follicles have<br>given up on the number of impacts he's<br>taken to his head over time since the<br>lack of here per se anyway leo when<br>rains rains built us this device so it's<br>got a court sensor here it's got a beam<br>that then triggers the recording as the<br>sword comes down time one time two for<br>velocity and we set this up in the<br>passageway because we needed a high<br>ceiling height which wasn't available in<br>the lab and had a whole succession of<br>staff and students who rule in the kendo<br>club come along and beat the hell out of<br>this device and we then put some skin on<br>top and some materials they use on the<br>kinder helmet and this allowed us to<br>establish these impact forces that were<br>measurable which we could then transfer<br>across to our model and once again using<br>our dental techniques of moldings etc we<br>first of all made a simple prototype and<br>into that we incorporated piezoelectric<br>strips to record the impacts at the<br>different layers on top of the skin<br>under the skin top of the scale<br>under the scale top of brain middle<br>brain base of brain etc and believed not<br>inside there is the head model and we<br>were then able to impact it and on top<br>of the helmet and we decided yes we were<br>on the right track but recording data<br>capture needed to be changed the next<br>phase is to a full anatomical model and<br>we duplicated a human skull and then<br>incorporated into the various layers<br>that I just described accelerometers to<br>be able to capture what was taking place<br>when impacted and there is the brain<br>going in and then the top going on and<br>this then resulted in this model we we<br>were able to then with a drop rail have<br>the same amount of impact force as we<br>had achieved so we took our kinder<br>impact device put it under here and then<br>adjusted the height until we were<br>achieving the same level so we knew that<br>we had that the same and then we put the<br>head and you see this line here that was<br>the cerebral spinal fluid going in to<br>maintain the pressure and we then<br>started to impact and this allowed us<br>then to measure these and with us data<br>capture device now we were then able to<br>measure the different points what was<br>taking place and look at the force<br>transferred down through the various<br>layers as well as the lateral movements<br>as well and the result of this research<br>we were able to then publish in the<br>Journal of concussion my excuse me the<br>effects of this and this research is now<br>ongoing t6 and we want to now continue<br>with this and to take it further do you<br>mean so weighty from here more topics<br>more funding and more fun okay I feel<br>privileged that I've been able to work<br>with such great colleagues in such great<br>groups on the wide variety of topics and<br>projects that we've done I really want<br>to thank you all for including me in<br>your groups and<br>and becoming part of my groups etc it's<br>a great place to work and thank you very<br>much indeed much appreciated<br>Neal really is a great pleasure for me<br>to have this opportunity to thank you<br>for your IPL tonight we've known each<br>other a long time and have become good<br>friends from the day that you started<br>through to now and it really is<br>fantastic for me to have the opportunity<br>to stand up here in front of you to<br>thank Neil for his presentation tonight<br>it was fascinating to hear of your<br>journey from Bulawayo through to Dunedin<br>from the SAS which we know little about<br>for various reasons I think through the<br>dental technology in durban and<br>eventually to Dunedin it's ironic that<br>the Institute that drew you to New<br>Zealand CIT and its closure is probably<br>what created the opportunity for you to<br>end up with us at OU Targo and so for<br>that I thank the Minister for doing that<br>back in the 90s Mike Swain teaching you<br>the importance of understanding the<br>simple is exactly what you try to do<br>with everyone that you work with<br>particularly your students and for that<br>they really appreciate you and what you<br>contribute and also I agree completely<br>with you that with a group you can<br>achieve much but even in a group you<br>need people that can do research anneal<br>you've shown us some extent outstanding<br>examples of your research and your<br>contribution to to the areas that you've<br>done research and over the years any<br>areas including bite force<br>investigations stress corrosion with<br>dental implants the ballistic brain<br>injuries creation of the skull skin<br>skull brain model and studies and a<br>concussion and sub concussion you really<br>have made a significant contribution to<br>research in your area as well as to<br>teaching in the university to your<br>profession our profession and to the<br>University and for that I congratulate<br>you on your promotion to prepare<br>and thank you for your I PR tonight<br>a significant token of appreciation from<br>the University which when you hang it up<br>wherever that you hang it up you will<br>look at it with pride every time you see<br>it so think you know thank you very much<br>thank you Akeelah tonight Auto account<br>or my name's Paul Brunton I have the<br>privilege to be the pro vice-chancellor<br>the Health Sciences and my role tonight<br>is to thank you the audience for coming<br>to this event<br>the IPL's are a fantastic part of<br>something that the university does and<br>they work extraordinarily well when<br>they're well attended so thank you very<br>much for coming tonight<br>your attendance here is very much<br>appreciated and it falls to me to invite<br>you to join us for refreshments on the<br>ground floor of the staff club and if<br>you follow the academic part you'll find<br>your way but before we do that I think<br>we should thank professor Waddell for an<br>extraordinary lecture here tonight thank<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
