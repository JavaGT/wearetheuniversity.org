Kyoto<br>Qatar Qatar welcome distinguished gifts<br>academic colleagues students supporters<br>friends to the inaugural professorial<br>lecture of meredith mara<br>professor in the school of linguistics<br>and applied language studies and a<br>particularly warm welcome to meredith<br>parents and brother who are with us this<br>evening I am professor Wendy Lana I'm<br>the Provost of Tohono Walker Victoria<br>University of Wellington New Zealand's<br>globally ranked Capital City University<br>and New Zealand's top-ranked University<br>for intensity of research and it's my<br>very great pleasure to host all this<br>evening I'd like to briefly introduce<br>professor Myra before I hand over to her<br>for her inaugural lecture professor Mara<br>completed her back to her Arts with<br>honours and her Bachelor of Commerce and<br>administration here at Victoria<br>University of Wellington majoring in<br>German of her honours degree before<br>completing her Master of Arts in the<br>room with sticks she carried on to<br>complete her PhD in linguistics at this<br>university rising through the academic<br>roles to become an associate professor<br>in 2015 she's been the head of the<br>school of linguistics and applied<br>language studies since 2016 served in<br>that role for three years four years and<br>was two days energy told<br>in search and study leave after<br>completing there but much more<br>importantly she was promoted to<br>professor on the 1st of January 2019<br>professor Mara is a sort our plenary<br>speaker known for her cutting-edge<br>methods and theoretical contributions in<br>the area of workplace discourse analysis<br>she serves her academic community both<br>as a member and former president of the<br>linguistic Society of New Zealand and as<br>an editorial board member of several<br>leading international journals for the<br>past two decades professor Mara has<br>researched effective communication in<br>New Zealand workplaces using recordings<br>of naturally occurring talk through the<br>language in the workplace project based<br>here at the University as the project<br>director since 2015 Meredith has lead<br>the team which has carried out research<br>into humour small talk meetings<br>miscommunication and management as well<br>as gender and culture issues a guiding<br>principle of this project has been to<br>expose assumptions about how things are<br>done around here to help newcomers and<br>marginalized group members find their<br>place at work<br>professor Mara's primary research<br>interest is in the language of business<br>meetings but she has also published in<br>the areas of power politeness or deed<br>impoliteness tumour and it speaks of<br>identity in arrangements<br>international journals she is co-edited<br>civil walks concerning the Linguistics<br>of work and supervises students and so<br>service presents and discourse analysis<br>professor Mara's research into workplace<br>talk has been used as the basis for key<br>materials for a course aimed at skilled<br>migrants who often miss out on work are<br>fitting their education and experience<br>due to lacking the social language<br>skills used in kili workplaces<br>she has been encouraged by the<br>increasing number of policy makers who<br>use and recommend her research-based<br>findings especially immigration New<br>Zealand who have funded the workplace<br>communication for skilled migrants<br>course here at the University for<br>several years now in this lecture<br>professor Meyer is going to use<br>real-life examples to describe pass the<br>parcel of decision-making explain the<br>importance of chocolate fish and the<br>relevance of talking in lists each of<br>these ideas will illustrate how language<br>research can contribute to empowerment<br>please join me in welcoming professor<br>Maura<br>Provost members of the senior leadership<br>team friends and family especially those<br>have traveled from quite a distance<br>including one who came 61 hours to get<br>here today and also ladies and gentlemen<br>Tina Coto Tina Coto tonight a tocar tour<br>I'm going to talk about these things<br>that you're probably thinking now why on<br>earth would they be interesting what<br>does pass the parcel have to do with the<br>workplace is a chocolate fish just a<br>chocolate treat and what about talking<br>and livers what's that about and I hope<br>that by showing you these various<br>elements that we've come across in our<br>data I'm going to charge you to help me<br>help others because I recognize this<br>epidemic we have a responsibility we've<br>got lots of power we sit at the<br>University we hopefully have good<br>knowledge and expertise but we also<br>deserve to give this back to the<br>community so that's what I'm going to<br>talk about today so you're probably<br>thinking about why we would do<br>linguistic research in the workplace<br>when I started working in this area in<br>the mid 90s there was hardly anything on<br>language in the workplace and it seems<br>like a very strange thing considering<br>how much time we spend at work why<br>weren't people looking at this and what<br>really existed was lots of surveys lots<br>of interviews also an expert opinion<br>people that were in the workplace<br>themselves but as linguists we know that<br>what people think they do is highly<br>likely not to be what they actually do<br>and so this was an opportunity for us to<br>go into workplaces and see what was<br>really going on and within that research<br>I've been particularly interested in<br>professional identity so if you're in<br>the workplace how do you navigate being<br>a nurse a builder a corporate manager<br>how do you do this in your talk with<br>other people so that's what I'm going to<br>talk about today this area was of course<br>quite a natural fit with me you may have<br>heard there that I have got a unusual<br>background for a linguist but not that<br>unusual for a socio linguist when I came<br>to this university and<br>in 92 I thought I was going to be an<br>accountant who spoke other languages I'm<br>not an accountant<br>instead I realized that I like listening<br>to what people were doing around me in<br>that workplace I like to find out what<br>they were doing with their talk and so<br>language in the workplace is a way for<br>me to match those corporate interests<br>with the linguistic knowledge that I<br>have and I've been very lucky because<br>I've worked with a wonderful team of<br>colleagues as part of the language in<br>the workplace project and those<br>colleagues are here with me today<br>emeritus professor Janet Holmes was<br>founding director of the project and<br>she's here and also dr. Bernadette vine<br>who have worked with all that time as<br>well an associate professor Maria's<br>Stuber who was also a founding member<br>one of the things that's very important<br>about this project is that we have a<br>responsibility to work with the<br>workplaces on things that are mutually<br>beneficial so our philosophy is very<br>much about collaborating and working<br>with people as Co researchers so that<br>means we identify issues that are of<br>interest to us as linguists but are also<br>helpful for the organizations we're<br>going into and we take an appreciative<br>inquiry approach and by this I mean we<br>go into places that are working really<br>well to find out why they're working<br>well you can imagine that makes it much<br>easier to get into places because people<br>if they're happy about the communication<br>will give us the audacity<br>but you might think she's a linguist<br>what does she know about working well in<br>some of our industries and actually it's<br>not asked it decides who are the best<br>communicators it's the industry<br>it's the colleagues people who say to us<br>this team was working really well can<br>you come and tell us why and so that's<br>how we go into organisations and then<br>work on these mutually beneficial goals<br>and throughout our processes we also<br>hand over control of the recording to<br>the participants so we're not in the<br>room when it's happening they're<br>recording themselves that means we don't<br>get to patrol exactly what we get but it<br>means we get really good quality data<br>because people are not scared of the<br>recorder or hiding from the video camera<br>but they're happy to give us their data<br>so as well as these recordings we spend<br>time in the workplaces getting to know<br>how they do things getting to know<br>what's important to them getting to know<br>where the important conversation happens<br>because it's not always in the boardroom<br>it might very well be at the watercooler<br>we get to find out that information and<br>then recorded that data and I've got<br>some figures here of working with 30<br>organizations and 500 people I think<br>that's a huge underestimation at this<br>point I know that there are people in<br>this room that have been part of this<br>recording process and I'm going to show<br>you data and I want to say to you<br>if you see data and you think that's a<br>wonderful communicator that's definitely<br>you if you see that when you think that<br>that's not a great communicator you know<br>it's definitely not you because<br>everybody seems to think everything is<br>thin I think actually none of you are in<br>the data today but I'm very very<br>grateful that you've participated when<br>we started this in the 90s we were using<br>audio cassettes and Walkmans this tends<br>to make my students cringe at the idea<br>that we have those set tapes we used to<br>have to put sellotape over the top of<br>all the holes on the cassette recorder<br>because people didn't know what to do<br>with all the holes in it we had to tell<br>them to turn over tapes since then we've<br>developed through various stages and now<br>use tiny digital recorders typically<br>attached to the non-dominant arm so if<br>you're a builder who uses your right<br>hand to use a hammer it's on your left<br>arm so they're tiny recorders now and at<br>the beginning we had massive video<br>cameras that it took two of us to move<br>around and now a camera could be a tiny<br>thing that's just attached to a wall so<br>it's been quite a change over the<br>lifetime but I want to show you just a<br>little video of what this was like at<br>about 2000 when we had started recording<br>in fact race to help answer this<br>question we asked workers from<br>successful factory teams and Auckland<br>and Wellington for help they agreed to<br>be wired up to enable researchers from<br>the language in the workplace project to<br>study their work day conversations so<br>you could see there were people in the<br>factory giving the recorders attached to<br>them so they could record what was<br>happening every day for us and it became<br>as normal to them as it could possibly<br>be to the extent that we got data we<br>really never thought we could get or<br>sometimes wanted to get because they<br>forgot the recorders were on them<br>the particular area of expertise I had<br>when I joined the probit project was<br>corporate organizations and so for a<br>long time I specialized in meeting talk<br>and you might feel this way about<br>meetings the thing the last thing you<br>want to do on a on every day occasion<br>luckily I'm quite the opposite<br>I think meetings are wonderful and when<br>I became head of school it was great<br>because all my days consisted of<br>meetings but when I'm in those meetings<br>I'm looking at other things I'm look at<br>least who's taking the floor<br>who's summarizing he's controlling the<br>direction who's changing what people are<br>thinking that's what's going on in my<br>head during those meetings and at the<br>beginning of my research in this area I<br>knew one thing and that was that I was<br>really interested in social and justice<br>and I wanted to look at what was<br>happening with power who had the power<br>should they have had the power<br>how could you challenge that power what<br>strategies could you come up with to<br>resist that power if you needed to and<br>that's my thesis their decisions and New<br>Zealand business meetings a<br>sociolinguistic analysis of power at<br>work and it's because we all know<br>organizational organizations are<br>hierarchical what's going on when that<br>power is being used when I began I used<br>critical discourse analysis which has<br>since been renamed critical discourse<br>studies with an advert political agenda<br>it was about D naturalizing the natural<br>looking at what we take for granted and<br>saying should it be that way I still<br>take a very critical approach but I've<br>kind of relaxed a weeny bit partially<br>because I found there are other ways of<br>making things happen and for me it was<br>more important that the change happened<br>that I stuck with that framework but I'm<br>going to give you some data that shows<br>all the different stages of my career<br>right from this time all the way through<br>to what I'm doing now and that's what<br>the past the parcel the chocolate fish<br>and the talking and lifts represent the<br>three stages of my career so some of you<br>who may have wondered about this<br>beautiful photo when my friend Cora Lee<br>took for me this is to represent the<br>kinds of things I'm talking about<br>we there have a set of hands<br>representing the powerful people handing<br>something to the less powerful people it<br>happens to have a chocolate fish on it<br>because we're in New Zealand and you'll<br>get the pass the parcel decision-making<br>going on in this discussion I'm about to<br>have with you and I warn you I'm about<br>to show you a transcript if you haven't<br>seen a transcript before the MSE we<br>don't talk in full sentences we repeat<br>ourselves we hesitate so just be warned<br>that this is what authentic talk looks<br>like when it's written down so I'm going<br>to start with one of my favorite<br>examples that I click to join my PhD<br>data collection this is with Queen Clara<br>Clara was the manager of this particular<br>group she had this nickname Queen Clara<br>which probably tells you quite a lot<br>about her management style but she was<br>very beloved within the group she also<br>had a lot of authority this particular<br>corporate team was charged with setting<br>up the call center for the multinational<br>organization they were working form they<br>had made a decision amongst them that<br>this would all be paperless so at the<br>end of the 90s being paperless was<br>something that was quite new but they'd<br>made this policy and in Harry raised an<br>issue with her he said they'd been this<br>request for screen dumps and what he<br>meant was printing down the screen so<br>that instructions were on paper and<br>Clara just said that no screen dumps no<br>screen dumps no screen dumps and she<br>also said there does not meet criteria<br>so very much like a robot this is the<br>answer and you can see that people tried<br>to challenge that idea but she kept<br>repeating no screen dumps it mean with a<br>little thanks for looking at that though<br>at the end so even she knew this was<br>quite a power move to be doing this into<br>a second-in-command jock Sanderson who<br>was known by a nickname<br>of his surname sandy said so that's a<br>clear well maybe not and she said it's a<br>no and based on her her nickname he said<br>opportune Oh a royal no they knew that<br>she was in charge she was not going to<br>be outdone in terms of which though so<br>she said did people<br>feel disempowered by that decision but<br>this is quite an interesting example in<br>that it's a very overt display of her<br>authority everybody knew that she was<br>using power and they accepted that she<br>was powerful what about the times when<br>the power is much more subtle more<br>covert more hidden what about the<br>decisions that appear to be very<br>collaborative but they're actually not<br>collaborative at all is it clever<br>negotiation by a manager or is it hidden<br>power play and this is what I refer to<br>as past the password decisions so right<br>here are two generations of my family<br>children at birthday parties looking<br>forward to playing past the parcel so<br>for anybody not familiar with the game<br>this is when a tiny gift is wrapped up<br>and layers and layers of paper it gets<br>passed around a group of children and<br>the circle when the music stops you get<br>to unwrap a layer and at the end<br>somebody wins the prize these children<br>all think that the speed at which they<br>pass that parcel means they might get a<br>chance to unwrap a layer they also think<br>that they have some skill and<br>determining who will get the prize at<br>the end but only a child would think<br>that wouldn't they I'm hoping that none<br>of you earn it's naive as to think you<br>have a chance of it prize the parent<br>controls exactly when the music stops<br>exactly who gets to open a layer<br>probably shares out the layers amongst<br>everybody at the party and they know<br>exactly who will get the prize at the<br>end I would argue that managers are<br>doing this all the time and the reason I<br>even had this idea was because I went to<br>an all-girls meeting where we were<br>having a strategy discussion about<br>something that the old girls were going<br>to do and at the end of the meeting I<br>attend the woman sitting next to me and<br>said doesn't they look beautiful on the<br>board and she said she turned back to me<br>and said of course it does<br>she wrote that before she came and I<br>thought oh I'm a teacher I should know<br>that I do that all the time<br>but soda managers so this is an example<br>of that sender you saw before doing<br>exactly this this is part one of the<br>small groups of Clara's bigger team they<br>were in charge of coming up with the<br>policies for this call center there was<br>also a communications team and the<br>policy people were probably quite quiet<br>they didn't really think they should be<br>the people communicating this to the<br>rest of the group they thought molly the<br>head of communications should be doing<br>that and so they say we wouldn't be<br>doing that Marlene would be doing this<br>we would be telling my leave<br>but sandy responds to them by saying I<br>would like you to be doing this I would<br>like you to do the communications<br>yourself I would like you to work<br>through Marlene and I want to point that<br>out but you need to remember that I<br>would like you to be doing it suggestion<br>that he's making at that point so at<br>this point he's not agreeing with their<br>decision but he's not being very very<br>authoritative about it he's just saying<br>I would easy think I as I would like not<br>you must do this a fortnight later the<br>same idea comes up again and Daisy<br>raises that is something we still have<br>to decide so even though at the<br>beginning she was adamant she wouldn't<br>be doing it now it's something we have<br>to decide who's going to be doing this<br>is Marlene going to be doing this in<br>sandy suggests I don't have more<br>credibility if it's you that does it<br>yeah she says you can see her beginning<br>to shift then you may move on to<br>something else and ten minutes later see<br>if another team meter member says that's<br>what we sort of questioned the<br>involvement of Marlene so again that's<br>quite ambiguous on paper but you can see<br>he's shifting towards the idea of why<br>wouldn't I lean be doing this why don't<br>we do this and then even later we get<br>Daisy suggesting the idea that they do<br>it themselves I think the more<br>information you can give to the field<br>the more they actually talk about it and<br>see if the grease yep and it's better<br>it's going to be better for us if we do<br>this<br>so by this point Daisy and Seth are<br>proposing this is a better idea and<br>insanely is freely giving them<br>compliments about coming up with this<br>great idea it's a big job we are<br>starting on so it's no longer them<br>that's doing it we are doing it and if<br>you do this you can go from this job to<br>being a spin doctor for the<br>prime-minister<br>lots of praise so really sandy made that<br>decision all along he just very cleverly<br>got them to a point of thinking they<br>were making the decision and this is the<br>kind of hidden power that you see<br>happening in workplaces all the time and<br>it's not an isolated occasion later on<br>I'll show you an example where they were<br>proposing a poetry evening for their<br>clients and instead of tuned into a 17th<br>century choir or a 17th century group<br>that was going to perform quite a<br>difference from the poetry evening<br>Mickey and the manager just moved them<br>along until they came up with that idea<br>which is exactly what he was proposing<br>at the beginning so it's just like pass<br>the parcel he's deciding exactly what<br>will happen so these kind of discourse<br>strategies they're presenting things as<br>an opinion rather than what has to<br>happen<br>questioning ideas hedging things<br>changing pronouns between what they want<br>and what will do and sometimes just not<br>taking your turn<br>sometimes just leaving silence and<br>eating other people come to these the<br>same decision you want them to come to<br>and these are typically very long<br>decisions they give the appearance of<br>democratic decision-making but really<br>it's not democracy at all it's still one<br>person making all the decisions because<br>the outcome very typically matches what<br>the powerful participant said at the<br>beginning now I can see those functions<br>and lots of different workplaces but the<br>way it happens looks very different and<br>you can think about this in your own<br>workplaces each time you change<br>workplace things are different aren't<br>they there's different ways of doing<br>things<br>there's different ways of doing things<br>around here depending on where you are<br>and this often often happens through<br>talk because it's not just what we say<br>it's what that means and the context in<br>which we're saying<br>and this means the in-group is very<br>important and this doesn't necessarily<br>relate to the country you come from it<br>might be that you're all an IT and<br>that's more important than the countries<br>you come from or it could be that the<br>country is really relevant each team<br>will be slightly different in the thing<br>that we focus on is the language on the<br>workplace<br>team is what's called socio pragmatics<br>it's how we negotiate meaning between<br>each other so the same thing can mean<br>lots of different things depending on<br>which group you're in but how do we<br>manage those processes of meaning making<br>so those of you who are very interested<br>in theory here's a very quick look at<br>theory to keep you happy we describe our<br>approach as being social realism so we<br>have lots of agency to make choices and<br>how we do our identity but these choices<br>are constrained by our interactional<br>norms by our community of practice or<br>team by the organization we're in or the<br>industry we're in and by society so<br>these all these layers that we have to<br>navigate all the time and this was a<br>model we came up with women were looking<br>at effective leadership in parkia and<br>Maori organisations but more recently<br>we've been using this idea to look at<br>newcomers to society so in particular<br>skilled migrants and refugees when they<br>come to New Zealand and the reason that<br>we're interested in this is because of<br>what we call a linguistic penalty with<br>an Associated Mattox so this is the<br>price of being different if you don't<br>follow group norms if you don't do<br>things the way everybody else does<br>you're typically penalized and it's<br>because people think that if you don't<br>do things the way they do you can't do<br>things properly so even though you might<br>be having agency and making choices to<br>do things differently because we're not<br>very aware of our own socio pragmatics<br>when you deviate it's not because you're<br>a competent professional it's because<br>you're making a mistake we're just this<br>these things are so entrenched that we<br>don't realize they're just norms then in<br>the not the way that everybody and<br>Tourette<br>let's because the way we talk matters<br>what happens is that people typically<br>say that a newcomer doesn't speak<br>English actually I almost always do<br>speak English but they might have<br>different socio pragmatics<br>understandings of things for example we<br>do small talk all the time I saw lots of<br>small talk when I was in this room<br>before can you imagine being in a<br>workplace without small talk and New<br>Zealand<br>can you imagine be a newcomer who thinks<br>that small talk does not belong at work<br>at all and watching all these New<br>Zealanders talk to each other about<br>inane things like the weather and rugby<br>and what was on television can you<br>imagine how different that might be and<br>you think that these New Zealanders are<br>doing something strange and the New<br>Zealanders think you're very standoffish<br>and probably rude for not joining in so<br>this socio pragmatics is a really<br>important part of it and that's how I<br>get to chocolate fish because I think<br>chocolate fish is part of the socio<br>pragmatics for New Zealand knowing about<br>chocolate fish and about rugby as I said<br>and the Wellington wind and thanking the<br>bus driver as you get off the bus these<br>are things that aren't shared and most<br>of you in the room probably have an<br>understanding of what a chocolate<br>fishers but if you didn't can you<br>imagine the idea of fish with chocolate<br>sauce on it it probably doesn't sound<br>that great to you and the idea of the<br>chocolate fish actually coming up in the<br>workplace which it does all the time<br>probably seems quite bizarre as well and<br>this is all about belonging we all learn<br>to belong we learn to belong as children<br>we learn to belong with me join a new<br>institution we learn to belong when you<br>join a new group what happens when<br>you're having to join in your country<br>and a new workplace in a new city in a<br>new industry and you're working at a<br>level that's not the same as the level<br>you used to work at there are two<br>dimensions or two of many dimensions to<br>this belonging but - I want to talk<br>about the place of belonging this<br>which is your sense of home and your<br>sense of familiarity and the politics of<br>belonging so I'll give my own example<br>here so I feel a sense of belonging to<br>Victoria University of Wellington my<br>great-grandmother came here at the<br>beginning of a being Victoria University<br>of Wellington her daughter my<br>grandmother came with her sisters my<br>mother came with her first cousins I<br>came with my second cousins my niece<br>Evie who is now the only female of the<br>next generation I hope will come with<br>her third cousin our if he had an aunt<br>who works at the university our has a<br>father and a grandmother working at the<br>University I don't think those Henderson<br>girls have a choice I think they're<br>going to end up here and I will<br>challenge in windy my niece everything<br>she's going to Harvard with good reason<br>she's 10 you might want to offer a<br>scholarship now and get her here so I<br>have a sense of belonging and I know<br>what it means to be in this room I know<br>what it means to be in the Hunter<br>building this is part of my sense of<br>belonging in terms of the politics of<br>belonging part of what I've done it's a<br>negotiate with you my belonging I've<br>told you I belong but you also have to<br>accept that I belong because this is a<br>co-construction I don't get to do this<br>on my own you have to find what I've<br>just seen salient you have to accept<br>that what I've seen is an appropriate<br>way of belonging<br>so this navigation is a very important<br>part of belonging so I want to look a<br>bit like how this negotiation works and<br>workplace talk through this notion of<br>the chocolate fish here is a be that<br>nice with her chocolate fish all over<br>her hands and her mouth this is when she<br>was younger she's 10 now she can't eat<br>chocolate without getting it everywhere<br>she lives in America she doesn't know<br>what a chocolate fish is she just knows<br>it's something that comes in the mail<br>from New Zealand she knows that it's a<br>treat but she doesn't know that there<br>could be all these connotations around<br>us and when you look it up online you<br>get this definition this is how people<br>sell a chocolate fish a favorable reward<br>for a job well done<br>that's an important part of the<br>pragmatics of what chocolate means<br>because otherwise it's just strawberry<br>marshmallow with chocolate but actually<br>it's that idea this is what you do you<br>get you promise you give for a job well<br>done so it stands for lots of things and<br>it has lots of connotations and it has<br>special meanings for different groups so<br>this is a really important part of our<br>knowledge in the community and I was<br>reminded by my colleague Jean Anderson<br>that it's one of their three F words of<br>translation food flora and fauna be very<br>hard to translate because they have all<br>these extra meanings so chocolate fish<br>is one of those things and that's<br>because of what we call indexicality<br>what are the symbols behind this concept<br>so win of the chocolate fish not just a<br>chocolate fish sometimes these symbols<br>are very direct so it is a chocolate<br>treat I think we I think that's pretty<br>universal in New Zealand we understand<br>it as a chopped-up treat but indirectly<br>it's a small reward sometimes it's just<br>the promise of a reward and the reward<br>doesn't actually have to come sometimes<br>it's just saying whatever you did was<br>worthy of a reward and also maybe cue<br>Jana nostalgia childhood all those other<br>meanings so you get the idea of a<br>chocolate fish to the first person to<br>reach their sales target or that no<br>chocolate for you to fish for you if you<br>don't cooperate and this is something<br>that you wouldn't expect to come up in<br>the workplace but as I see it<br>it does and it came up for me just<br>recently I was I received a chocolate<br>fish award and then I looked back and<br>found I had another chocolate fish award<br>so this was given to me by the Faculty<br>of Graduate research because I was a<br>panelist on Pennell for new PhD students<br>to talk about what it was like to<br>supervise and to build a relationship<br>with your supervisor there's also a<br>photo there of the chocolate fish that<br>I've got given on friday friday by my<br>colleague benedict fine for finishing my<br>hit of school time<br>a job well done that's what she was<br>telling me with this very fancy<br>chocolate fish that original yellow card<br>home of the chocolate fish attached to<br>the chocolate fish is no longer there as<br>you can imagine but I was I knew exactly<br>how to receive this this was a really<br>important thing for me now it may have<br>taken me an hour or so to prepare two<br>hours to be in the room and this seems<br>like oh it's a piece of cardboard with a<br>fish attached but actually it was<br>entirely appropriate and made it<br>worthwhile for me to have put that work<br>in because somebody acknowledged I put<br>working but if it had been more than<br>this that would have felt really wrong<br>because all I did was sit on a panel so<br>it was a way of thanking me in a way<br>that showed they knew that what I've<br>done was worthy of a chocolate fish and<br>as I said it comes up and talked very<br>regularly this is a ministry obviously a<br>very professional high functioning<br>ministry and yet to be talking about top<br>of this so the manager teases her junior<br>MIM staff member saying ma you're part<br>of the solution and EEMA teaser spec I<br>only want to be part of the problem and<br>she says don't you dare be part of the<br>problem I'll keep giving you vitamin C<br>bananas chocolate fish so this was being<br>used as a way of building and group and<br>coherence and jollying along the team to<br>get them to work hard as well and then<br>Emma's doing very well she had more<br>chocolate fish than everybody else last<br>week even though she couldn't eat them<br>because of the holes of her teeth but<br>this is her palate and your chocolate<br>fish are coming up and sometimes<br>chocolate fish get extended into other<br>ideas so we also get the chocolate fish<br>idea being turned into a chocolate frog<br>idea this is the example I talked about<br>before about that client function and<br>what would happen would it be a poetry<br>evening in this case they're talking<br>about what will be in the goodie bags<br>for the clients and they talked about<br>last year they had chocolate their show<br>actually it was chocolate frogs because<br>it was a gardening theme so again this<br>is a very important thing they're giving<br>gifts to their clients this is a row of<br>thinking the clients for being involved<br>in their organization<br>but they're going to give them the<br>equivalent of a chocolate fish something<br>that seems so trivial<br>again as insiders we go - it sounds nice<br>I'll get a chocolate fish if you're an<br>outsider this is bizarre behavior so<br>this is this power of the chocolate fish<br>there's lots of hidden meanings these<br>are small things but they have meanings<br>that in group the in remembers know<br>about and they're completely opaque to<br>outsiders and that social meaning of the<br>chocolate fish actually does a lot of<br>work it talks about the lack of<br>tolerance for power difference you don't<br>give a big gift because that would<br>suggest you've got lots of power<br>difference between you so it's a small<br>gift it's indirect it's implicit it's<br>they're not making too much of a fuss<br>while still acknowledging somebody it's<br>showing that you've lots the quality in<br>the New Zealand workplace or the<br>appearance of a lot of lots of equality<br>and the New Zealand workplace so it<br>matches a whole lot of things that we<br>would put under the path er cultural<br>order and this is something my colleague<br>Janet Holmes has written about about the<br>culture order in New Zealand and we're<br>there since so this chocolate fish<br>that's a whole lot of work I'm not<br>suggesting that culture is the same for<br>everybody though you must know not all<br>New Zealanders do the same things<br>not all linguists do the same things not<br>a women do the same things but it's one<br>of those things that has indexical<br>qualities and we negotiate these with<br>other people I've chosen chocolate fish<br>but I could have chosen lots of other<br>things but these lots of social meaning<br>and these are actually things we<br>negotiate on a dynamic basis it all<br>means that we can all be involved in<br>group norms this is not something that<br>just the majority do we can all<br>participate on this but we have to be<br>actively involved in that negotiation<br>and that negotiation is quite hard and<br>it shows that we have to be really<br>dynamic when we're doing the kind of<br>qualitative research that we're doing we<br>have to look big quite in-depth we don't<br>just go into a workplace and leave again<br>we're typically involved with that<br>workplace for months and with some of<br>our workplaces we're still in<br>connections within 15 years later this<br>is not something you drop in and out of<br>you really need to understand what<br>going on if it doesn't mean I can't give<br>you hints that work every single time if<br>you're taking the minutes of a meeting<br>and you can't work out when a decision<br>happened it probably occurred just<br>before everybody laughed because<br>everybody laughing as a signal that the<br>tensions been relieved so if you have to<br>take minutes you don't know what's going<br>on wait for the laughter rewind a bit<br>whatever was just said was probably the<br>decision and the other thing I can tell<br>you is it returns somebody asks you a<br>how question how's it going how was your<br>weekend how was your holiday you can<br>almost always answer with fine things<br>and then ask them the question back to<br>keep this MOOC going and if it's a what<br>question not much and hand it back<br>though to keep the nation going between<br>you and small talk<br>those things are pretty full proof but<br>being given you hints like that is not<br>really helpful because what you actually<br>need to do is teach a woman to fish so<br>rather than handing out those tips what<br>we've discovered us is much better us to<br>look at the kinds of things to look at<br>and teaching people to be their own<br>analyst because we can't tell you what's<br>going to happen and your immediate<br>context with those people but we can<br>tell you what to watch out for we can<br>tell you about hierarchies we can point<br>out these things are common and lots of<br>workplaces but more importantly you need<br>to learn how to be your own analyst and<br>this is something that's been put into<br>practice within our school so I've<br>talked about the language in the<br>workplace team and in particular Jenna<br>Holmes and Bernadette vine have been<br>working with me for a long time we have<br>two amazing colleagues and lucky<br>Reliford and Angela Jo who have taken<br>those research results and turned them<br>into teaching materials and using also<br>ideas like Jonathan Newton here and<br>theoretical ideas about how to make that<br>happen and this is how we get to talking<br>and lyft's so this is the course it's a<br>course called workplace communication<br>for skilled migrants it's been supported<br>in particular by the settlement unit and<br>immigration new zealand and it's<br>designed for unemployed and<br>underemployed skilled migrants so these<br>are the stereotypical doctors and judges<br>who come to New Zealand and end up<br>working as taxi drivers so they come to<br>New Zealand because we<br>them have skills shortages they come on<br>those visas and then they can't get work<br>when you ask employers why they're not<br>employing them they say because they<br>don't speak English even though they do<br>so the people in these courses have to<br>have been unemployed or underemployed<br>for two years they have to have tertiary<br>qualifications they have to have iOS 6.0<br>for anybody who knows IELTS they have to<br>have experience at our industry and our<br>goal is to work with them to develop<br>these analytic skills using a naturally<br>occurring talk as the basis for the<br>materials so it's about developing<br>appropriate communication practices and<br>also getting experience so it's a<br>12-week course six weeks in the<br>classroom six weeks and an internship in<br>a supported environment where is also<br>coming back into the classroom to<br>reflect on what's happened in this<br>course has lots of people involved in<br>Wellington so as well as in be aware<br>talk on aggression New Zealand is also<br>rotary helps out with this course and<br>lots of other mentors and help out it<br>has a very high success rate<br>some cohorts everybody gets employed<br>some only 80% of it only 80% is not bad<br>for people that have been unemployed or<br>underemployed for two years in a<br>preliminary cost-benefit analysis said<br>for every dollar of taxpayer money that<br>goes into it<br>$70 has returned to society so it's a<br>pretty good return rate for the country<br>which is also great because the<br>alternative is New Zealand put puts<br>money into helping skilled migrants and<br>they move to Australia so we don't want<br>that to happen when we really need these<br>people in the country so that's we were<br>talking your lifts come this comes in<br>and I particularly want to talk about<br>some resources that are on the work talk<br>at websites and sup fear that has used<br>our research findings as a basis to help<br>with the advice and we've done this as a<br>collaboration now you've probably never<br>thought about you're left to get a kit<br>you've probably thought about which way<br>you face you know which way to face on a<br>lift have you thought about the fact<br>that you actually talk to people on the<br>Left New Zealanders do this<br>a standing on the left silently is very<br>uncomfortable this is not shared this is<br>one of the things we do in New Zealand<br>that other people don't and somebody in<br>the room was with me in Hong Kong and<br>before we got to the left he said to me<br>don't talk in the left because he said<br>talking in the left and it's an identity<br>that I did not want to have so this is<br>not something that's universal at all my<br>similar thing happened when I was went<br>into the women's toilets in the UK and<br>with two of my colleagues who didn't<br>know I was there they were talking to<br>each other between the cubicles and I<br>said listen to us talking to each other<br>in the toilet it's like we're in New<br>Zealand it made me laugh quite loud they<br>were sprung I was there I heard them<br>this is the kinds of things we take for<br>granted we don't think about this<br>so talking unless there's something else<br>that can be very problematic and it's<br>because of the socio pragmatics that<br>I've been talking about this is part of<br>socio pragmatic competence if you don't<br>have it it's very hard to participate<br>you can't be a full member of the group<br>without this it's such a small thing<br>but if you think this is wrong if you<br>think small talk isn't has no place in<br>the workplace it can be very very<br>difficult and it means you can't<br>negotiate your professional identity you<br>can't be seen necessarily as somebody<br>who should join the workplace and we<br>always say failure to abide by these<br>norms has real-world consequences and<br>they don't because if you don't do this<br>you might be seen as standoffish or rude<br>and you're definitely not employable<br>because who would want that personally<br>workplace and all it is if we have<br>dominant group members and we expect<br>people to do things our way even though<br>we don't recognize it's only our way and<br>so I'm gonna show you one of those<br>videos to encourage you to go and do<br>these tests because one of the things<br>I'm very proud about that MB and the<br>settlement unit did was every time there<br>is a resource for an employee there is<br>also a resource for the employer both<br>sides need to participate in this<br>so here's this video for you let's see<br>I assume you can all feel the discomfort<br>you felt what it would like to be a net<br>lift but it was discomfort for both of<br>them so if you have a go at these<br>exercises on that work talk site it<br>gives you options as to what you would<br>have done if you were John would you<br>have done nothing<br>if he can't manages his own problem or<br>would you have tried to do a bit more or<br>what if you would you have talked to one<br>of his team members to get them to get<br>involved and if you were Robert would<br>you wait for the next lift so you didn't<br>even have to get in with the boss would<br>you not worry about it cause he'll get<br>it or would you make any effort to try<br>something even asking him if he's having<br>a good day or something about the<br>weather and when you do this it will say<br>oh yeah but try or no probably not or<br>that's the best answer so I encourage<br>you to go and have a go and see how<br>you'd get on in the situation and if you<br>don't have time to go through all the<br>exercises because they're all based on<br>authentic examples of things that could<br>be problematic there's also a set of<br>cards and I've chosen the one here of<br>fitting in and being part of the team<br>there's some advice for how that would<br>work in both directions and I've lined<br>it up next to one of the mentors from<br>the workplace communication program and<br>what they said to a skilled migrant<br>intern so they were fully licensed to<br>give opinions and advice of things that<br>were happening and Leo was talking to<br>Isaac the mentor he the intern he was<br>working with and he told him to sit with<br>people at lunchtime learn the language<br>I'm guessing in the social pragmatics<br>that's what he meant listen to the jokes<br>participate that's what he was being<br>encouraged to do because these things<br>weren't coming naturally to Isaac he was<br>brilliant at his job knew how to do it<br>technically lots of experience this is<br>what was hard<br>there's participating in mentors were in<br>a very good position or are in a very<br>good position to do this because they<br>have permission to do it and this is a<br>lovely example again of humor and how<br>humor can be really difficult so small<br>talk to me difficult humour can be<br>difficult in this case Andre was talking<br>to his mentor Emma and he's talking<br>about where he goes within their<br>intranet to find things that are<br>appropriate for him<br>and Emma says just don't move anything<br>or somebody will shoot you and Andre<br>reacts quite a lot to being told that<br>somebody's going to shoot you he is from<br>the country where there would be this<br>kind of violence but I don't think<br>that's why he's reacting as this what<br>does this mean and Emma realized that he<br>reacted and said no I'm joking<br>and then explains what the joke means<br>cuz he doesn't get it at all he has no<br>idea what she said this to him and she<br>explains the meaning behind it when we<br>say somebody will shoot you they're<br>going to tell you off and she says they<br>won't really shoot you I promise<br>and she also points out that if you're<br>violent in the workplace you're going to<br>get fired there's no way that would<br>happen either but it's humorous and he<br>laughs and recognises that was humor and<br>thanks her but she needed to explain<br>what was going on she hadn't thought<br>about this at all she was just speaking<br>we've asked skilled migrants afterwards<br>after they've got the jobs that were<br>appropriate for them what it was like<br>and it's very sobering it's a majority<br>group member to listen to what they say<br>it's very telling this might be quite<br>challenging to you if you're a majority<br>group member so after the internship I<br>had somehow to a certain extent adapter<br>to the New Zealand workplace the<br>communication styles that were very<br>casual the working environment the<br>attitudes the work ethic the core values<br>what she needed to survive so this was<br>really serious it was about survival<br>this is what you had to do to get on and<br>she depressed it and she knew what she<br>was doing another person heard some<br>harsher things to say about us how do<br>you navigate this and it was I'm not<br>sure if it's a good thing to show that<br>you have lots of experience<br>you probably recognize the tall poppy<br>syndrome coming through there don't tell<br>people you can actually do this<br>it depends on the people so again it's<br>dynamic but my mentor said to me<br>with the experience you have we expected<br>you to understand but actually it's<br>about socio pragmatics so ya had done<br>this job for a long time to get it but<br>not a realization from the dominant<br>group member that they were certain ways<br>of doing things<br>things were assumed to be common<br>practice with no need for explanation<br>I'm taking steps to understand New<br>Zealand work culture and people I'm<br>trying to understand how much diversity<br>New Zealanders can take we think of<br>ourselves as being very open and<br>inclusive you can see how if we're<br>talking about chocolate fish and you<br>have to stand on the left with your<br>manager some of these things are really<br>really difficult but I didn't want to<br>end with a horrible message like that we<br>all feel very bad about ourselves I<br>wanted to end with a success story some<br>of you may have noticed that my middle<br>name is Halina when you saw my thesis so<br>this is Halina who was pseudonym for me<br>and she worked really hard during the<br>workplace communication for skilled<br>migrants course she really tried out new<br>things and made the most of her<br>experience she in this instance is<br>talking to him into edward and she's<br>been asked to do a stocktake<br>she was an accountant it was various<br>accounts she was looking at antique of<br>Sir a directive and the directive is you<br>can have a read through them if you want<br>to if you want to you must read through<br>these things if you want to but she<br>recognized that that she was being told<br>what to do but she used to humor<br>she said do I have to laughed she was<br>really cheeky but he found it very funny<br>too because he knew what he was asking<br>you to do was very boring so do I have<br>to any laughter that's really quite easy<br>this was theme bonding this was her<br>using humor successfully this was<br>showing that she knew who she was being<br>asked to do something beneath her he<br>knew it too they were just getting on<br>together and being equal so it's a<br>lovely example of humor which is so<br>difficult to do being successfully<br>achieved there one of the skilled<br>migrants<br>and I wanted to show you there to show<br>you that it's also a two-way street<br>it's up to all of us a negotiation of<br>belonging it's not something you can do<br>alone it requires all of us to be<br>involved in this I've raised your<br>awareness I hope of lots of the socio<br>pragmatic differences if you're aware<br>that could be those kind of differences<br>you're more likely to see them and<br>accept them and recognize that while it<br>might be the issue it's not that<br>somebody's being rude is that they do<br>things differently to you and if we<br>recognize that then we can negotiate<br>through this idea of belonging and<br>that's really my challenge to you so<br>when you're in these situations just<br>take a second thought think well why<br>didn't they go well what was I doing<br>that also didn't make that go well<br>because language messes it's not just<br>speaking English that's how you speak<br>English it's not just project bridging<br>presenting ideas any old way it's how<br>you present them that matters in tiny<br>feathers can make a big difference so<br>recognizing that you're using socio<br>pragmatic norms or you're following the<br>way we do things around here<br>there's an important part of helping<br>with successful communication and it's<br>important because when we do our jobs we<br>typically don't do them alone and in<br>silence we might be doing it through<br>email or you might be doing that through<br>talk but people matter we're not doing<br>them on our own it's very rare to have a<br>job when you don't interact with other<br>people and there's socio pragmatics as<br>part of these relationships but I also<br>want to argue the research matters<br>because without the research you don't<br>know what those things are so also we<br>need the research to help us work out<br>how to make sure people matter to see<br>what those subtle differences are to see<br>how we can be using language and that's<br>something that's been very important to<br>me that's probably the summary of my<br>career over the last 20 to 25 years is<br>realizing what power I have and what my<br>research can do so I want to end back on<br>this photo<br>so I have all that power my goal is to<br>use that power the power that I have is<br>an expert in workplace discourse<br>analysis to empower others I'm going to<br>leave you with the challenge to think<br>about what you're doing and seeing if<br>you can empower others - thank you very<br>much<br>in Amana in Omaha Jennifer Qatar<br>namekian Mahalo yakeru party my name<br>tena koe PITA coca ramÃ³n category you<br>wanna go out and eat Meredith Varma<br>cursorily tokugawa coho Tiamo<br>or Johanna our guru good evening I'm<br>professor Sarah Liggett I'm Dean of the<br>Faculty of humanities and Social<br>Sciences to one another Murray and it's<br>my privilege this evening to offer the<br>vote of thanks on behalf of us all to be<br>severe enough mara for her excellent<br>inaugural lecture as professor of<br>linguistics attended in melaka victoria<br>university of wellington communication<br>using language to share information and<br>make social connections is at the core<br>of many human enterprises and of course<br>this includes communication and our<br>workplaces an area that was long<br>overlooked in linguistic research but<br>that's no longer the case thanks in no<br>small measure to Professor meredith mara<br>and her colleagues any loop to this<br>evening Meredith has given us a<br>compelling overview of over twenty years<br>of scholarship on workplace discourse<br>produced by internationally acclaimed<br>language in the workplace project house<br>Fitness University work that is<br>internationally recognized as<br>groundbreaking for its focused on<br>naturally occurring talk and for its<br>innovative<br>logical arguments and influential<br>analytic models the research through and<br>practice of the language in the<br>workplace project is the exemplar<br>worldwide of scholarship and practice on<br>workplace communication and<br>miscommunication the discourse of<br>meetings cross-cultural communication<br>understanding power an unspoken<br>relationship rules and Meredith's<br>lecture this evening has confirmed that<br>this high reputation is thoroughly<br>deserved through the real-life examples<br>that Meredith has shared with us this<br>evening with a pass the paths of<br>decision-making exemplified by Queen<br>Clara and Sandy the direct and indirect<br>symbolism of the chocolate fish or the<br>significance of small talk in lips she<br>has reminded us of the key role played<br>in communication by assumptions and<br>shared understandings that go beyond<br>linguistic competence this is research<br>that is of particular relevance and the<br>contemporary globalized context of<br>workforce mobility in which employees<br>move increasingly between jobs countries<br>provisions and industries during their<br>working lives for a whole raft of<br>reasons were necessitating the<br>navigation of new linguistic<br>environments and different workplace<br>cultures it's in this context that<br>Meredith's research plays a pivotal role<br>when the Ministry of business innovation<br>and employment wants to ensure migrants<br>and refugees Six's for employment they<br>are able to draw america's expertise we<br>community and other agencies and<br>organizations want to understand the<br>effectiveness of
