for<br>students who would have been studying on<br>campus and New Zealand and for students<br>offshore where your course has a test or<br>an examination scheduled these will be<br>replaced by take home assessment<br>exercises conducted online we know this<br>is a big change to the usual way we run<br>tests and exams and we know that this<br>will create challenges for some students<br>we're advancing solutions to ensure that<br>all students will be supported to<br>complete assessments online a number of<br>important changes will be made for<br>online assessment exercises that replace<br>tests and examinations these changes are<br>necessary to allow for technical<br>challenges or time zone differences that<br>might occur assessment exercises that<br>replace tests will be open for 24 hours<br>assessment exercises that replace<br>scheduled examinations will be open for<br>24 hours and will still be held during<br>the examination period a university<br>examination

students have limited access to<br>high-speed broadband it won't be<br>possible for teachers to rely on live<br>streaming of lectures or other learning<br>resources all online resources should be<br>made available to download students<br>selling tests and exams and the special<br>conditions the 24 hour test and<br>examination window will accommodate<br>students who are usually granted<br>additional time to complete the test or<br>examination students with disability<br>related support needs that are not being<br>met by additional time alone such as<br>having a reader or writer should liaise<br>with student disability services 7 days<br>before the assessment takes place<br>student disability services will work<br>with course coordinates to find<br>alternative solutions including<br>different but equivalent assessment<br>options in accordance with the<br>university's inclusive learning and<br>teaching of students with impairments<br>guidelines then there is the question of<br>grades because of the challenging<br>situation we're confronting the<br>universities decided that all students<br>who achieve a c-minus C or C plus will<br>have the right to opt for a pass/fail<br>mark instead for that course academic<br>integrity we're all on this together as<br>a community of learners teachers and<br>researchers in this moment of<br>uncertainty and challenge

values and academic<br>citizenship practices is to complete or<br>review the university's academic<br>integrity course the study skills page<br>on the library's and learning services<br>website has
