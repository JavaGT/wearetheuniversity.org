This animated short musical features 3 elderly birds: an ailing Owl, a physically challenged Tui, and a couple of isolated Korean Godwits who sing about challenges of mobility, loneliness, and self-reliance. The film has been a collaboration between Professor Merryn Gott and Dr Lisa Williams from the University of Auckland’s School of Nursing and Associate Professors Sarina Pearson and Shuchi Kothari from Media and Communication. <br> <br>Funded by MBIE’s Ageing Well National Science Challenge, Professor Gott and Dr Williams conducted interview-based research on issues of social isolation and loneliness among New Zealand’s elderly. They approached Drs. Pearson and Kothari who devised a funny, touching animated short film that could live on social media, in policy rooms, and on the film festival circuit. Kothari and Pearson chose animation because they believed  that anthropomorphic animals and birds in particular have a great capacity to communicate powerful ideas more concisely than live-action characters. After reviewing more than 200 pages of interview material while scripting Elder Birdsong, the research was clear—these were not self-pitying old people. They were resilient, engaged and eloquently pointed out the systemic social structural problems that contributed to their sense of isolation and loneliness. To reflect the inclusiveness of the nursing research, 3 bird characters were created. Yukfoo Animation designed the birds and brought the characters to life on a very tight budget. In terms of voice-work there was a strong commitment to casting culturally appropriate performers for the respective birds.  Rima Te Wiata’s rendition of the elderly Tui is a testament to the power of voice in animation.  Musician Marshall Smith’s composition of the melody elevated the film’s lyrics and high school teacher Margaret’s willingness to take her singing from her classroom into the studio gave our Pakeha Owl real sincerity.  The Korean non-actors that voiced the Godwits had never sung outside of the shower!  All films are collaborative, but animation even more so.  This project is an ode to our wise Kaumatua (elders) and the team who made it hope it inspires people to pay their older relations and neighbours a visit, or at least pick up the phone. <br> <br>http://www.elderbirdsongfilm.com<br>https://www.who.int/film-festival</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my husband my friends my kids are<br>overseas and to make matters worse my<br>feet are all swollen and my eyesight is<br>failing<br>we moved here to help with the<br>grandchildren they're older now they<br>don't need us we tried to make new<br>friends but our English is not good I<br>don't know sometimes I feel they don't<br>like us here chrome Mirage morale<br>so many times we wait for the bus and a<br>driver one even stop by Cuddy don't even<br>talk about the bus this quarry Turkey<br>nor did not live them and never on time<br>and the bus stops too far away doesn't<br>even ever show them I can't read the<br>tiny timetable Oh even if the bus did<br>come I can't get on or get off supposed<br>to visit my money<br>right in my street trust me we don't<br>want to be a burden on anyone we don't<br>even like to complain we know our<br>children have busy lives but sometimes<br>we wonder what is worth moving here<br>c'mon yo add revision Tarantino I'm<br>stuck here in the city my final a<br>faraway with summer passed on my<br>multiple not too busy<br>well sometimes you just want to have a<br>little check no one can talk about your<br>things we like my independence<br>Brenda don't do your fire we might teach<br>you a thing or two like a way to meet<br>each other make new friends and sing<br>together especially to judge a chance to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
