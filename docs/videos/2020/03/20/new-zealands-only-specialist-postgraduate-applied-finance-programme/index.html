I<br>completed my Bachelor's in Economics<br>from the University of Delhi and it was only<br>in the final year of my graduation<br>that I developed a particular interest<br>towards Economics and financial sector<br>that's when I decided to pursue my<br>further studies in Finance.<br>The math programme focuses on educating people so<br>that they can develop an executive<br>career in the finance industry.<br>The<br>courses are designed in a way that they<br>are customized to the students best<br>interest so when we design a course the<br>question is not just how do we transfer<br>the academic knowledge but it's actually<br>how can we apply this to your mind of<br>work or how can we actually organize<br>this course in a way that you could use<br>this knowledge.<br>Once you're done with<br>this program and then you take a job.<br>My name is Pete Latham I'm a Currency<br>Trader at BNZ. <br>I studied the Master of Applied Finance<br>at Victoria University.<br>One of the good<br>things about the programme is you can<br>really steer towards different<br>directions.<br>I think the program's probably unique in<br>terms of really digging deep into<br>something you really want to do and I<br>found that really useful for what I do here.<br>The program is quite flexible, you<br>can do part-time or full-time once you<br>start the program there are varying<br>degrees you can get.<br>So you can get a<br>graduate diploma in Financial Market<br>Analysis or you can get postgraduate<br>diploma in Financial Analysis or<br>Treasury Management or you can<br>actually continue and do the whole<br>program and get your Masters of Applied Finance.<br>The other nice thing about<br>the courses is that the courses are<br>designed in a way that you can work around your schedule if you're already<br>working,<br>Their format really suited me so I could work during the week and then<br>study in the weekends. I guess it gave me a<br>bit of an advantage when it came to<br>studying because I've been seeing some<br>work and then also the stuff I was<br>studying I can apply it at work straight<br>away.<br>While I think previous study in<br>Economics, Finance, or a related field is<br>desirable, it's not a requirement so we<br>actually consider people with practical,<br>scholarly, or professional experience<br>even though they may not have done any<br>economics degree or any finance degree before.<br>Throughout the programme we have a<br>lot of courses that don't just deliver<br>academic knowledge but they're actually<br>quite practical. The students have a<br>chance to see actually what the economic<br>methods are available but at the same<br>time they'vee a chance to apply them to<br>real world data sets it's very useful as<br>well because that's what they're gonna<br>be doing when they actually get to use<br>these methods in their work.<br>That's the<br>best thing about this financial<br>econometrics course, it really helps me<br>focus in towards what is ready when you<br>know the job scenario.<br>In the math<br>programme is very useful for students to<br>accelerate their career because if they<br>are at the beginning of their career<br>they could get a very nice head start so<br>they could get all the knowledge that<br>they need throughout their career or if<br>they're in the middle and they already<br>have a job experience they can bring<br>that to the program and then learn more<br>about the academic information the<br>academic knowledge and see how that<br>would apply to their line of work and<br>make that next step to a bigger a better<br>position.<br>In this programme a person can<br>select any of the courses which they are<br>really interesting doing, that's the best thing about Victoria University and the Master of Applied Finance programme.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
