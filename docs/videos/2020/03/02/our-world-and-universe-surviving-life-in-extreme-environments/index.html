Focusing on mitochondria, Associate Professor Tony Hickey explores the biological mechanisms that allow extraordinary marine life to thrive in even the harshest of environments and what this could tell us about our own adaptation to climate change.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>some of the big things that limit life<br>food carbon dioxide oxygen water and<br>temperature one of the big things here<br>in New Zealand is we have this group of<br>fish that can tolerate large ranges of<br>temperature others really tolerant to<br>changes in salinity others really<br>tolerant to changes in oxygen and these<br>fish are called triple fin fish and a<br>rival Darwin's finches fact Darwin's<br>finches are a bit rubbish there's about<br>nine species of darwin's finches at<br>about 27 New Zealand triple friends and<br>they range from different depths from<br>subtittle where temperatures are<br>constant and oxygen levels are nice and<br>flush and then there are rock pools<br>where oxygen levels diminish down to<br>almost absolute zero and they've<br>actually become super high for about 200<br>to almost 300 percent<br>now these fish provide an awesome<br>example so an intertidal fish can<br>survive temperatures that get up to<br>maybe 28 degrees one of the big things<br>that's fascinated me is how do animals<br>survive massive changes in temperature<br>and high temperatures and so for fish<br>this is quite a big issue most animals<br>actually die from heart failure when<br>they get too hot the question has been<br>what actually drives heart failure some<br>thought it was the lack of oxygen<br>because there's this oxygen and warm<br>waters but we actually thought that<br>maybe it was effects on the powerhouse<br>of the cell within the hearts of these<br>animals and that's the mitochondria all<br>complex life forms in other words I mean<br>animals and plants they have<br>mitochondria within their cells and the<br>mitochondria is this ancient bacteria<br>like thing which invaded billions of<br>years ago and to herself and it takes<br>sugars and fats and proteins or Minow<br>acids and breaks them down and releases<br>ATP which is adenosine triphosphate<br>fundamental currency or many of life and<br>they require oxygen to do this so we<br>explored how the mitochondria performed<br>it at high temperatures and we invented<br>ways of measuring this magical ATP<br>and we found that there was a massive<br>drop and ATP production at specific<br>temperatures and these temperatures were<br>always just below the temperature where<br>hearts failed in fish and we found that<br>fish that say live in intertidal zones<br>their mitochondria are more robust at<br>these temperatures so there have been<br>adaptation to the mitochondria and how<br>it could adapt to elevated temperatures<br>and they work what we call less leaky<br>and more efficient as a mammal gets<br>hotter so we operate at about 37 degrees<br>as we go above that we start to have<br>trouble and so it's fundamental to<br>understand how this happens because when<br>we have heat waves around the world<br>quite often the young young babies and<br>the elderly who have weaker hearts and<br>impaired cardiac function compared to<br>young adults they tend to have heart<br>failure and die from us so it can<br>provide insights and say what organs are<br>cool first after someone is suffering<br>from heat stroke and so in reality you<br>would sort of think well maybe the heart<br>we know that the world is heating we<br>will suffer increased climatic events<br>where with high temperatures so insights<br>to how organisms such as ourselves or<br>our crops or our animals that you know<br>we're farming we have to understand how<br>they're going to survive by temperature<br>but there's probably some more<br>interesting things out there as well so<br>there are animals that actually tolerate<br>real extremes in temperature there are<br>hydrothermal vent animals that can<br>tolerate up to 70 degrees and there are<br>little ants that can run across the<br>deserts of the Sahara<br>so understanding how these animals do it<br>may be actually at the core of<br>understanding how life can survive on a<br>planet in the thermal limit<br>of life here or perhaps anywhere in the<br>universe<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
