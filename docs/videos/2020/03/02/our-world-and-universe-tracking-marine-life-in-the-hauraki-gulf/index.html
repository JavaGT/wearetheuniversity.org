font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>most of the time we interact with the<br>ocean that's<br>sitting in our kayak or a boat<br>you know we're looking at it we're quite<br>useless in the ocean even the most<br>expert of divers can only stay down for<br>short periods of time before we have to<br>come to the surface again our planet is<br>70% ocean we're not really planet earth<br>where planet ocean and it is responsible<br>for over every second breath you take<br>there is a lot going on in our ocean and<br>we know so little about it we know more<br>about space than we do about our ocean I<br>know it's not a competition but it's<br>actually a really important thing to<br>consider see your ad<br>eleven o'clock the harouki golf teacup<br>and walnuts in one a new year toy is New<br>Zealand's only marine National Park it<br>has his own act of law to protect it<br>it's a really dynamic space it's a<br>shallow coastal environment it's only<br>about 50 meters deep and it's it's<br>really productive environment it has<br>warm surface waters but cold waters that<br>come underneath across the seabed and<br>what mixes with the wind this place is<br>home to around 25 percent of the known<br>seabird species in the world it's also<br>the home to around about 20 species of<br>whales and dolphins with year-round<br>populations living here it's a really<br>productive environment and can support a<br>lot of life when Marty arrived here it<br>was a very different place to what we<br>see today there were many many seals<br>there were a lot more birds there was a<br>lot more life there was a lot more fish<br>in the sea and it's changed quite<br>dramatically as we've developed to this<br>area<br>we're in the early phases of changing<br>our view of the ocean from a 2d vision<br>that we have to 3d and we're actually<br>able to use a lot of space technologies<br>to help us understand life<br>beneath the ocean that 3d space that<br>animals live we're now able be used<br>large unmanned drones to survey the<br>whole Gulf we can then take the symmetry<br>and using artificial intelligence we can<br>understand and order all of the visual<br>imagery we have so we can take the<br>sounds of a fish of Kiner of whales sea<br>birds that make noise under the water to<br>communicate with each other and then we<br>can overlay the Saku stick information<br>with our visual information then we can<br>take environmental variables like sea<br>surface temperature times season all<br>kinds of you know varying influences to<br>understand all of the drivers of why the<br>big animals are where they are in time<br>and space and the past this has taken us<br>hundreds of hours to go through every<br>piece of footage but now these tools<br>that are used mostly for space science<br>can be used to understand environmental<br>science<br>thirty-six degrees thirty point six five<br>four our work must be able to scale you<br>can fly around or drive around the Gulf<br>for hours and hours and see nothing and<br>then suddenly there are these<br>aggregations of many different species<br>feeding on prey in the same spot we'll<br>be able to use small drones to look down<br>and understand what different species<br>make up that that feeding mass we can<br>take water samples from the sea to<br>understand the smell of the sea a cue<br>that many animals use to find their prey<br>will be able to sample phytoplankton and<br>zooplankton to understand the beginning<br>of the food chain and we're going to use<br>all of these different tools and<br>techniques to understand the whole Gulf<br>satellite imagery is able to show where<br>areas of productivity are where the<br>phytoplankton are and we will use that<br>to predict places where we might be able<br>to find prey aggregations and all these<br>birds and sharks whales dolphins feeding<br>together the thing that's really<br>important is that the Gulf has changed a<br>lot and we want to make it a better<br>place than it is currently to do that we<br>need to be able to understand the<br>drivers and to predict what might happen<br>especially under scenarios like climate<br>change so that we can protect and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
