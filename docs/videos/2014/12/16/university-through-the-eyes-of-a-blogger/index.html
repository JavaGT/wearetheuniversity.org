font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>frigging first-years in just two weeks<br>I've already been relieved my<br>preconceptions of university for some<br>reason I thought you knew would be<br>filled with sophisticated and<br>self-assured students but realistically<br>it's just high schools with less<br>boundaries I write the blog partially<br>for myself that sounds really selfish<br>but I enjoy writing and sharing stuff I<br>read it with people in the year below me<br>and mines so people that I know from my<br>high school knowing that that was me<br>last year and thinking about what I<br>would have wanted to know I'm just<br>generally to help people out and kind of<br>maybe make people laugh at some of the<br>stuff that I've done<br>one thing I was excited for was<br>independence and I got it of all the<br>things that could freak a fresher out<br>total independence is definitely at the<br>top of the list I have written about so<br>much stuff I did a lot of stuff on those<br>specific papers that I'm taking I spent<br>two blog posts writing about all of the<br>a-holes of residents I've blogged about<br>my friends they're so funny so I had to<br>another assumption that I'd made was<br>that there would be enough seats to<br>everyone in the lecture theatres but I<br>was met by swarms of students outside my<br>first lectures I wanted to know what<br>some of the classes would be like from<br>someone's point of view who's actually<br>taking them as well as what lectures are<br>like and just the whole experience I<br>mean I always he hadn't done it before<br>so that's what I want to know it<br>hopefully I've conveyed some of that to<br>people that I've been writing for the<br>university work on is a really good<br>place to be and there's just lots of<br>opportunities here I mean you'll meet<br>heaps of people and all the courses are<br>interesting I haven't heard anyone<br>complain freedom is bittersweet<br>I had my final exam on Monday physics on<br>60 and at the end of it I was mutually<br>depressed at the exam excited that the<br>study was finally over and lost due to a<br>lack of pressing things to do my last<br>blog was a bit of mixed emotions it was<br>quite sad I mean I enjoyed writing them<br>I mean I can remember writing the first<br>one so it doesn't think that long ago I<br>do feel that it is of the utmost<br>importance that I now include something<br>about how fast the year has gone because<br>it was literally yesterday that I moved<br>into uni hall with all my bags and boxes<br>and it seems absolutely ridiculous that<br>it's all over I have no idea how I'm<br>going to move all my stuff out next week<br>hopefully you internet creepers have all<br>enjoyed my vlogs</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
