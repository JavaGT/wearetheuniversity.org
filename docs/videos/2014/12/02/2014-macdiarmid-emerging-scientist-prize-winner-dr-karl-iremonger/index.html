From this, he was able to understand how connections from other brain cells regulate neuron activity and hormone secretion, resulting in normal fertility.<br><br>His findings are internationally significant and could throw new light on how other neurons regulate different bodily functions, challenging long-held beliefs about how the brain works.<br><br>http://www.pmscienceprizes.org.nz/macdiarmid/</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so the human brain contains around 80<br>billion neurons or brain cells<br>with over 100 trillion connections<br>between all these different brain cells<br>so this makes it impossible to currently<br>understand how the whole brain works<br>so scientists like myself instead focus<br>on smaller parts of the brain<br>we focus on understanding how individual<br>brain cells work and how small networks<br>of brain cells function the idea being<br>that if we can understand these small<br>networks reduce systems that we can one<br>day build up and understand the entire<br>brain i'm really interested in how the<br>brain controls essential survival<br>functions such as fertility the stress<br>response and metabolism<br>so what i've discovered is that the<br>brain cells which control fertility<br>actually function very differently to<br>other so-called normal neurons<br>they're structured very very differently<br>and in fact they process information<br>completely differently to<br>all other known brain cells<br>and so this opens the door for more<br>treatments to regulate fertility brain<br>cell function and hopefully regulate<br>fertility in humans<br>the discovery of this really challenges<br>long-held beliefs about how<br>the individual building blocks of the<br>brain work that is the single brain<br>cells so if we've discovered this new<br>brain cell structure and function one<br>area of the brain and it's possible that<br>if we look hard enough we actually find<br>this in other areas of the brain this is<br>really exciting because it opens up the<br>possibility of new ways to treat other</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
