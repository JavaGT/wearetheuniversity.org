members<br>of the university council colleagues<br>graduates families friends I am deeply<br>honored to participate in this<br>graduation ceremony the university of<br>otago is New Zealand's oldest university<br>in a meeting of the university council<br>in November 1869 one speaker expressed<br>the hope that the establishment of the<br>university will quote elevate the moral<br>and intellectual tone of the society<br>which in a young colony is so peculiar<br>exposed to material influence I'm not<br>sure these material influences have been<br>eliminated from our campus yet but I<br>firmly believe the University of Otago<br>has long fulfilled the hope that it<br>would contribute to the Enlightenment of<br>this nation I have chosen this momentous<br>occasion to consider a topic that is<br>sometimes downplayed and even<br>misrepresented and yet it is pivotal to<br>creating a better world for New<br>Zealanders and citizens everywhere I'm<br>talking today about the transformative<br>power of Education what do I mean by<br>education education is broadly defined<br>here as the process of gaining<br>understanding and knowledge through<br>learning I speak of education because of<br>the unparalleled possibilities and<br>challenges presented in a rapidly<br>changing global environment in the last<br>three decades globalization a restless<br>and overarching mega trend has been<br>radically reshaping the international<br>landscape globalization can be<br>understood as the intensification of<br>technologically driven links between<br>societies institutions<br>cultures and individuals on a worldwide<br>basis the traditional assumption that we<br>live in a cop a compartmentalized world<br>where sovereign states hold exclusive<br>sway has been shown to be deficient<br>rather the story of the post-cold war<br>era is one of growing interconnectedness<br>a context in which many challenges<br>whether they be in the economic security<br>or environmental spheres can no longer<br>be resolved by States acting alone but<br>there is a paradox while the number of<br>national problems requiring<br>international solutions is multiplying<br>many sovereign states remain in denial<br>about their declining ability to act and<br>so the international means for<br>addressing these challenges remains weak<br>and incomplete since the late 1980s the<br>world has entered a turbulent and<br>prolonged transition to a new<br>international order this transition is<br>characterized by an uneasy coexistence<br>between the opposing forces of<br>integration and fragmentation on the one<br>hand globalization has been associated<br>with startling advances in communication<br>the establishment of a genuine genuinely<br>ikan at global economic system a global<br>information infrastructure the internet<br>increased trade and foreign investment<br>and the steady growth in the number of<br>countries embracing democracy in some<br>shape or form in this context the<br>experience of New Zealand are sparsely<br>populated and graphic greater<br>geographically isolated society sheds<br>light on both the intensity and the<br>extent of the global integration process<br>in the era of globalization New Zealand<br>has redefined itself recognized the<br>special constitutional cultural position<br>of Maori people built new links with the<br>Asia Pacific liberalized its economy<br>used the World Trade Organization to win<br>trade disputes not least with Australia<br>international Isaac's film industry and<br>Evette and eventually establish close<br>ties with the two superpowers the United<br>States and China on the other hand<br>globalization has its dark side the<br>compression of time and space through<br>technology has unleashed new perils or<br>exacerbated existing problems examples<br>include the advent of transnational<br>terrorism the proliferation of<br>intrastate war or wars within States<br>drug and human trafficking international<br>organized crime global pandemics<br>weakening financial accountability<br>relentless environmental decline and<br>growing inequalities today in the world<br>of 7.3 billion people 900 million do not<br>have enough to eat 1 billion are<br>illiterate and 1 billion do not have<br>access to safe water at the same time<br>eighty-five percent of the world's<br>richest people own the same amount of<br>wealth as the 3.5 billion poorest which<br>is close to half the world's population<br>these trends have cast a long shadow in<br>New Zealand the country has seen a sharp<br>rise in income inequality housing is now<br>less affordable and education has become<br>more expensive there is also growing<br>contamination of our waterways through<br>intensive daring and increased national<br>exposure to the u.s. dominated popular<br>entertainment industry this is the<br>international transition we are living<br>through today the trajectory of change<br>in the future is towards a multipolar<br>world but it is an uncertain journey<br>ahead the International failure to<br>squarely address climate change a<br>fundamental threat to our planet and<br>burgeoning conflicts in places like<br>Syria Iraq Gaza and the Ukraine are<br>testing me to the marginalization of the<br>UN Security Council and is too<br>we're great powers ironically still<br>attempt often with disastrous results to<br>extract partisan advantage from<br>situations over which they have little<br>or no control so what can be done about<br>the downsides the various downsides of<br>globalization how can the positive<br>aspects of globalization be harnessed to<br>alleviate these problems with or without<br>its new seat on the UN Security Council<br>New Zealand faces two types of challenge<br>first New Zealand and other smaller<br>states must be prepared to take on a<br>more active international role as<br>globalization deepens relying on the<br>Great Powers alone to solve the world's<br>problems will no longer work compared<br>with great the great powers of the past<br>I would suggest today's heavyweights are<br>more vulnerable and more interdependent<br>than ever before at the same time we<br>must not resign ourselves to defeatism<br>and despair in the face of human<br>suffering in New Zealand and in the<br>world we must summon the courage to try<br>to reduce human suffering because as US<br>president john f kennedy what's remarked<br>the most basic common human link is that<br>we all inhabit this small planet we all<br>breathe the same air we all cherish our<br>children's future and we are all mortal<br>second we need not just we need not just<br>the will but the capability to influence<br>the direction events and it's my deepest<br>conviction that education is ultimately<br>the key to countering the dark sides of<br>globalization a defining condition of<br>being human is that we need to<br>understand the meaning of our experience<br>education is the tool that helps us to<br>learn to make our own interpretations<br>rather than act on the purposes the<br>beliefs and the judgments of others<br>education provides the analytical<br>capacity to expand the boundaries of our<br>thinking to keep pace with the sweeping<br>changes that are occurring in the word<br>today unfortunately twenty percent of<br>our fellow human beings on this planet<br>do not presently have the chance to<br>experience the transformative power of<br>Education so my message to those who<br>have graduated today is that our world<br>needs you yes our world needs you there<br>is so much to be done to improve life in<br>New Zealand and beyond and your<br>high-quality education at the University<br>of tago provides a strong foundation for<br>doing so your knowledge and skills can<br>Beaufort advance your career aspirations<br>and also make a positive impact in a<br>wider setting in the 21st century it is<br>possible perhaps for the first time in<br>human history to envisage a world that<br>is free of hunger and where all citizens<br>can read and write and where seemingly<br>intractable problems like climate change<br>can be tackled we do not have to stick<br>with policies or practices that do not<br>work or work for relatively few people<br>history is dynamic not static as former<br>west german chancellor willy brandt once<br>observed problems created by human<br>beings can also be solved by them but<br>and it is a big but it will take more<br>than dreams to realize the vision of a<br>better world courage passion and<br>persistence will be necessary but<br>ultimately the success of this effort<br>will depend on the tools provided by a<br>sound education well reasoned arguments<br>evidence knowledge analysis and good<br>communication skills these are among the<br>elements that make education a<br>transformative force and as new<br>graduates you are now in a good position<br>to make a positive difference to New<br>Zealand's world in my view there is no<br>more rewarding experience than helping<br>to improve the lives of others and I<br>wish you all every success in the future<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
