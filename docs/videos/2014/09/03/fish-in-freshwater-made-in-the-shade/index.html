He's now one of the leading freshwater fish experts in the country and his area of expertise is freshwater fish ecology and environmental relations.<br><br>Professor Hicks was part of the team that developed New Zealand's only electrofishing boat - which temporarily immobilises fish, enabling them to be caught and analysed.<br><br>In his Inaugural Professorial Lecture this month, Professor Hicks will provide an overview of his career to demonstrate some of the research discoveries he has made throughout the year. <br><br>The Inaugural Professorial Lecture Series at the University of Waikato introduces our newest professors to the community. The 2014 series will showcase some of their latest research in Education, Science and Management - come along to find out what our people are doing, and how their work is having a real impact on the world around us.<br><br>All lectures are free and open to the public.<br><br>Time and venue:9 September,  6-7pm at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, Gate 1, University of Waikato. Opus Bar open from 5pm. <br><br>For more information about this lecture, please visit: http://bit.ly/YYnOk2.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um my name is Brandon hick and I work<br>for the School of Science and the<br>faculty of science and engineering and<br>I've been at this job now for 22 years<br>and um did my PhD at Oregon State<br>University Oregon and fish School of<br>Fisheries in Wildlife okay I've been a<br>freshwater ecologist for all of my<br>working life and my current research<br>interests revolve around stable isotopes<br>for looking at food webs of um aquatic<br>systems both freshwater and sometimes<br>Marine another research strand that I<br>have at the moment is to use oolith<br>microchemistry now oths are the small<br>bones in fish's head and they accumulate<br>calcium carbonate a bit like a tree<br>grows its rings so in those Rings is<br>locked all of the fish's life history of<br>the water that it's experienced is sort<br>of Frozen in the crystals of the calcium<br>carbonate lattice the lecture that I'll<br>give will have a kind of a broad<br>approach to the different things that<br>I've done in my research career which<br>have been quite varied and uh and<br>especially my early um career where we<br>did a lot of river<br>research in looking at hydr scheme and<br>the effects of those on Fisheries um<br>through to the stable isotope work that<br>I've done looking at food webs and um<br>and then the fish abundance work that<br>we've done both streams and lakes and<br>probably finishing off with the A<br>microchemistry and the remote sensing<br>work that we've done so come along for<br>an expose of um a wide variety of of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
