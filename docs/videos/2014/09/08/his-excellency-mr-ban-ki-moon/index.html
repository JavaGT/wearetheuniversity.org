heavy<br>responsibilities you are looking to me<br>to do all what I should do as a<br>Secretary General of the United Nations<br>to bring peace and security and<br>sustainable development and protect the<br>human rights of all the people around<br>the world particularly women girls and<br>marginalized group of people indigenous<br>group<br>people ladies and gentlemen with this in<br>mind uh today I'd like to briefly review<br>the current Global<br>landscape New Zealand is my final stop<br>I'm going back to New York today this<br>evening<br>but it began from B<br>Indonesia I went there to attend the<br>United Nations Alliance of civilization<br>meeting and this is quite un unfamiliar<br>name not much recognized by other people<br>but if you see that there are so many<br>natural<br>calamities in our world and<br>heartbreaking like digesters and<br>diseases and one thing is at the Ebola<br>outbreak in West Africa we are<br>mobilizing all United Nations agencies<br>and funds and programs and tools and<br>resources to first of all provide the<br>medical support and contain the further<br>spread to other countries and help those<br>countries affected for economic and<br>social and health health systems uh<br>capacity buildings but there are so many<br>what really trou us is that there are so<br>many man-made crisis man-made crisis we<br>are living among multiple crisis there<br>is a lack of mutual understanding and<br>respect for belief and understandings<br>and religions of other other people<br>that's the<br>beginning of the tradition uh conflict<br>which we are now experiencing<br>sadly that is why United ations at the<br>beginning of my term has created an<br>alliance of civilization to promote<br>genuine understanding and help resolve<br>these are fundamental problems through<br>respecting each other understanding<br>better and<br>deeper the religious belief and whatever<br>one may come from whever what may come<br>from we have to address all these root<br>causes of the problems which we have to<br>uh address now let me go by just briefly<br>because of time limit the first Middle<br>East is a case in<br>point we now have an extended open<br>ceasefire uh in<br>Gaza our goal<br>is open the space for political process<br>political resolution of this issue which<br>has been<br>over six decades all<br>programs that is the only way uh to<br>achieve lasting peace in their region<br>the peace between Israel and<br>Palestinians has a global and Regional<br>and Global implications and a core of<br>the peace in the Middle<br>East while we are seeing so relative Cal<br>at this time only after 50 days of<br>Destruction and killings of people<br>and destruction of the society we have<br>to bring two parties to the negotiating<br>table and bring all the problems which<br>have been already identified and let<br>them resolve this issue through a<br>dialogue so that Israelis and<br>Palestinians can live in peace and<br>Harmony side by side Israel people<br>Israeli people have legitimate right to<br>live in peace without fear at the same<br>time Palestinian people should be able<br>to leave without under the condition of<br>occupation they should not their<br>movement their freedom should not be<br>restricted and their society should be<br>reconstructed that's what I'm going to<br>do and that's what I now actively<br>discussing ING with the part's<br>concerns turning to the abhorent<br>situation in<br>Iraq I have appealed to all the<br>religious and political leaders in Iraq<br>and in the region to stand up for<br>tolerance mutual respect and<br>nonviolence uh first of all we have<br>to protect the human lives we have seen<br>such a boot<br>killings by Islamic States and again I'm<br>condemning in the strongest term today<br>for the brutal beheading of journalist<br>yesterday this is a totally unacceptable<br>such kind of inhuman brutal crimes which<br>is a crime against humanity those<br>perpetrates perpetrators must be brought<br>to Justice and this is a firm policy of<br>Nations I refuse to<br>accept that whole communities can be<br>threatened by atrocity crimes because of<br>who they<br>are or what they<br>believe we have to make all our society<br>free from believing in and practicing<br>what you<br>believe and Eastern Europe I'm<br>concern about the bordered situation<br>between Ukraine and Russian<br>Federation lives are at stake peace in<br>Ukraine means peace in the<br>region and Beyond it has again Global<br>implications in peace and security it's<br>area I have been speaking to the leaders<br>of both Russian Federation and<br>Ukraine I have been urging them that<br>they should sit down together sit down<br>together and discuss all these issues if<br>there is any Grievances and complaints<br>or misunderstandings I that's the only<br>way that the best<br>way I have been discussing this matter<br>with Western colleagues European union<br>and Americans and<br>again I'm calling them uh to resolve<br>this issue in a peaceful way at the same<br>time United Nations has deployed<br>humanitarian assistant team as well as<br>human rights monitoring team together<br>with osc teams and we are doing our best<br>under very difficult dangerous<br>situations to protect human lives and to<br>provide humanitarian assistance who have<br>been affected<br>now we have many other<br>troubles in Syria the situation has been<br>continuing four years more than three<br>million people have become refugees and<br>more than half of their total population<br>11 million people have be become<br>affected they need urgent assistance<br>from us and the situation in South Sudan<br>Central African Republic Libya<br>Mali Democratic Republic Congo there are<br>always a problems and many people are<br>still being killed at this moment I'm<br>not going to go down all these countries<br>because of time limit but I'll be very<br>happy to engage with you in a Q&amp;A after<br>my uh<br>gentlemen the United Nations is dealing<br>with<br>the consequences of these destructive<br>forces we have more than 100 20,000<br>missions just<br>today again I condemned the attack that<br>killed four chadan peacekeepers serving<br>with missions in<br>Mali last week 44 Fijian peacekeepers<br>were<br>detained it's not clear when they will<br>be a<br>released and our team in Goan Heights<br>our Force Commander and our negotiators<br>are actively engaging with the rebel<br>this armed groups to have them released<br>as soon as possible I have been urging<br>them demanding them to release them UNC<br>unconditionally immediately attacking<br>peacekeepers who are engaged in peace<br>mission is a crime against humanity it's<br>a totally unacceptable one and I have<br>spoken to a Fijian prime minister<br>assuring him and people of Fiji that we<br>will do our utmost efforts to get them<br>released as soon as possible our<br>courageous blue helmets went there to<br>bring stability to the people I have<br>condemned these attacks in the strongest<br>possible terms<br>again ladies and gentlemen since the<br>birth of peacekeeping New Zealand has<br>contributed military and civilian<br>Personnel to our<br>operations since the beginning Inception<br>of this peacekeeping operations New<br>Zealand has been contributing and<br>working in at least 40 40 different<br>missions to bring peace<br>there one of his first engagement was in<br>my country Republic of Korea in<br>1950 New Zealand sent troops to rescue a<br>Korean people from from the war I was<br>just six years old at that time so I<br>didn't know the meaning of what is known<br>as collective security in the chart of<br>the United Nations I was too young to<br>know that but I knew<br>that Korea was not alone Korea was<br>supported by the International Community<br>by the United<br>Nations I knew that world<br>was by our side that has given me a<br>strong image about the United Nations<br>United Nations was the peorn of Hope Our<br>Savior now standing and working as a<br>Secretary General of the United Nations<br>I'm humbled whenever I see so many<br>people around the world they look to the<br>United Nations they still regard United<br>Nations as the beacon of who then how<br>can I meet the expectations of them how<br>how can I<br>deliver all what they need that really<br>makes me humbled and and gives me an<br>added motivation that I should work even<br>harder and<br>harder but as you know peacekeeping<br>carries a high<br>price since the beginning of this<br>peacekeeping operations more than<br>3,200 people have paid their ultimate<br>the price in the course of delivering<br>peace five new Landers were among them<br>they died in different circumstances but<br>they all<br>died in the course of Peace the best way<br>to honor their memory is to carry on<br>their<br>unfinished missions that is what we are<br>doing the United Nations peacekeeping<br>missions and civilian Personnel they<br>working day in and day out in a very<br>circumstances we know that this military<br>means and if forceable means are<br>effective sometimes effective the best<br>way is to resolve all this issue without<br>without using any forceable means that<br>is why United Nations has a group of<br>mediators and negotiators at standby<br>wherever there may have some symptoms of<br>Crisis or active crisis we are sending<br>we are able to send our mediators and<br>negotiators envoys within 48 hours we<br>are always on<br>standby but you should know that it is<br>not always peacekeepers and envoys<br>United Nations civilian Personnel they<br>are also working very hard we have seen<br>many civilian personnel who have been<br>killed and died for various reasons in<br>the course of doing humanitarian and<br>human rights and<br>missions our due initiative human rights<br>upfront puts human rights at the heart<br>of<br>our fieldwork it's the first thing that<br>we have to protect the human rights and<br>protect the human lives after<br>that we try to resolve all other<br>issues the United Nations vaccinates<br>more than half of the children around<br>the world we feed some 90 million people<br>in 80<br>countries we help more than 38 million<br>refugees and other fleeing others<br>fleeing dangers including a 3 million<br>refugees we provide them food and<br>sanitation and water and cool things<br>daily the life saving work is only<br>possible with the support of all member<br>state of the United Nations that is why<br>I'm so grateful to New Zealand and H<br>people when I was here 3 years ago I<br>learned your University's<br>Moto in<br>labor that means Ingenuity and hard work<br>this applies to<br>New Zealand Ingenuity and hard work for<br>the United Nations and I thank you for<br>that ladies and<br>gentlemen this country has been a long<br>and staunch champion of nuclear and<br>conventional<br>disarmament I hope that with New<br>Zealand's ratification of arms traded<br>treaty we will<br>see this arms trade treaty will become<br>effective before the end of this year I<br>had discussion with prime minister John<br>Key yesterday morning and I'm quite<br>hopeful that we will have for the first<br>time this arms traded deal become<br>year I also appreciate the New Zealand<br>contributions over the years to<br>promoting Security in Afghanistan Timol<br>the Solomon Islands and buan B in papan<br>yugin and New Zealand is a<br>Pioneer on gender equality as the first<br>country in the world where women was<br>given right to vote and I congratulate<br>and really I admire your<br>farsighted<br>Vision uh today New Zealand is a party<br>to most of the core inter international<br>human rights<br>treaties New Zealand also endorsed the<br>UN Declaration on the rights of<br>indigenous people in<br>2010 and it has actively promoted<br>indigenous rights as you may be aware<br>with a strong support and initiative of<br>New Zealand the first ever World<br>Conference on indigenous peoples will be<br>convened in New York<br>on 22nd of September this month 22nd and<br>23rd in New York New Zealand aid program<br>and assistance have been pivotal to<br>helping countries in the Pacific region<br>to<br>develop New Zealand Representatives<br>serve on a number of key United Nations<br>bodies development bodies including undp<br>UNICEF un women<br>and the very distinguished alumni of<br>this University Helen<br>Clark she heads the United Nations<br>development program and I I count among<br>many senior advisors again are<br>University<br>alumni Jan biger who is sitting with us<br>he is she is also a alumni of this<br>University she heads the worldwide<br>campaign against HIV AIDS and I thank<br>you<br>CH dear<br>friends when I was in high<br>school I had an extraordinary privilege<br>and luck in a sense to have an<br>opportunity of visiting the United<br>States in 1962 that was 52 years<br>ago I was invited by American Red Cross<br>now Red Cross works for Humanity and I'm<br>very proud that my experience at that<br>time with Red Cross now led me to work<br>as a Secretary General still working for<br>a<br>Humanity they sponsored me to travel<br>several cities during a month<br>time during that program very<br>distinguished new zealanders were<br>represented like<br>um Joseline Jones josine Brown Jones and<br>shley Ken who are here today and I'm<br>very happy that after my meeting with<br>them here three years ago in Oakland<br>we've been meeting several times and I'm<br>very happy that Charlie King and josn<br>Jones are together with us and I thank<br>best ladies and gentlemen our party at<br>that time<br>had a great Fortune to meet President<br>John F Kennedy at the White House we<br>were just a young young students uh you<br>may expect the thrill and excitement and<br>honor we had but at at the same time<br>that was a moment of<br>inspiration maybe big impact on young uh<br>people like myself who came from very<br>dusty a small village in South Korea<br>when he was addressing the group of<br>people we were from 40 countries about<br>100 students he said<br>that well the leaders of the<br>country sometimes do not get along<br>well but people do people<br>do that he said that there are no<br>National<br>boundaries the question only is that<br>whether we are ready to Pro to give<br>helping hand who need our support and<br>our need that really has given me a deep<br>sense of<br>inspiration then at that time I decided<br>to serve in the public service for the<br>people who may need our support at that<br>time I was thinking only about Korea my<br>country because my country was so poor<br>then I should do something big and<br>public for my country now I am very<br>proud and very honored to serve for the<br>world but that was the beginning of my<br>Public Public<br>Service Now ladies and gentlemen we do<br>not need to<br>separate across borders we need to look<br>together and who is hurting and how we<br>can help<br>them<br>ladies and gentlemen I just came from<br>apia<br>Sam where I attended third International<br>Conference on small island developing<br>States more than<br>100 countries were represented<br>there I met the prime minister of Samoa<br>T Lia who is another distinguished<br>graduate of this great<br>University the main concern of small<br>Islands developing states are Central to<br>our Global push to end poverty extreme<br>poverty to promote sustainable<br>development and address the climate<br>change at this time United Nations<br>has top three priorities first of all we<br>have to meet the target of Millennium<br>development goals by the end of next<br>year 20 2015 listen Millennium<br>development goals is a blueprint most<br>successful for anti-poverty<br>vision but we may not be able<br>to achieve all the goals and the score<br>cards are all uneven that's why member<br>states are actively working to shape the<br>future development agenda after 2015<br>that's what we call sustainable<br>development<br>then thirdly we have to have a global<br>legal agreement on climate change that<br>we have to have by the end of next year<br>in Paris the member states have<br>reaffirmed reaffirmed many times that we<br>have to have this agreement but there is<br>no such effective<br>Global globally governing climate change<br>agreement so far<br>by the<br>time our planet Earth is sending signals<br>that I am sick I have a<br>fever this temperature is going up and<br>this planet Earth our modern nature is<br>now getting temperature what have you to<br>do when your children are having<br>temperature you have to go to doctor you<br>have to let temperature down we<br>have historical and political<br>responsibility moral<br>responsibility to contain the global<br>temperature rise within two degrees by<br>the end of this<br>Century that is why I am convening<br>climate change Summit meeting on<br>September 23rd in the United Nations and<br>I have been asking world leaders this<br>will be most successful highest and<br>largest ever a summit meeting in the<br>United Nations and I am very much<br>encouraged by their strong and positive<br>responses I'm asking them to bring<br>ambitious very high Target to reduce<br>greenhouse gas emissions and announce it<br>world we need Solutions we need<br>Solutions but these Solutions<br>Maybe coming from all different<br>countries in different<br>way but national government leaders they<br>should do on their own now New Zealand<br>by any standard is a very clean<br>environmentally sustainable country<br>among them yesterday I was very much<br>impressed therefore I would like to just<br>briefly introduce what I saw yesterday<br>while visiting tapur at the Taro<br>trust I was impressed by how they are<br>using Timeless wisdom to address modern<br>challenges one official told me there I<br>quote the most powerful force in the<br>world is not science or<br>technology it is the imagination of the<br>younger<br>generation this is absolute absolutely<br>true you can be the most powerful force<br>in our world<br>now why I was so much impressed while<br>visiting this<br>too the this is a village where mostly<br>ma Mai they are working among themselves<br>to make their economy their Community<br>sustainable our deputy secretary and<br>everybody was<br>there I was encouraged by the approach<br>of<br>geothermal renewable energy Horticulture<br>and waste management that giving all the<br>leftover waste from food and<br>whatever to<br>warms that produce very rich natural<br>fertilizer for organic<br>food this is something which we have to<br>practice and<br>emulate learning to live harmoniously<br>with the nature our mother nature mother<br>planet earth that is the one which we<br>need that kind of wisdom as should be<br>practiced by all the countries and all<br>the people around the<br>world distinguished faculty and friends<br>as a young<br>man when I met shy and JN and all<br>other young students from around the<br>world at that time Korea was not even a<br>member of the United Nations we are just<br>the<br>Observer but I could have never imagined<br>that Direction my life would<br>take as I said I wanted to serve in the<br>public service so I chose a life of<br>diplomacy that was my path but I'm<br>telling to Young students particular<br>young<br>students you may take all different<br>sorts of path you can become a<br>politician artist business persons<br>or volunteers and Civil Society leaders<br>but that's up to you that's your<br>prerogative to choose what kind of path<br>you will do for or for yourselves but<br>just think about what you can do for<br>other<br>peop New Zealand<br>is oecd country a very rich country and<br>very peaceful there is no fear of<br>security it will be very difficult for<br>you to understand and look beyond your<br>National border how other people are<br>doing in developing most of the<br>developing<br>world and I'm telling you that you do<br>not wait until you graduate from the<br>universities right now you can take<br>actions often we say that you are the<br>leaders of tomorrow but you have already<br>taken<br>your stands and to become a leader of<br>today professors senators and presidents<br>and prime ministers and including myself<br>we may be the leader of<br>today soon tomorrow we'll have to hand<br>over our PN to two of you you must be<br>ready<br>to take charge of this to make this<br>world better for all environment is<br>sustainable economically and so socially<br>the politically<br>stable and everybody's human rights<br>should be protected this is what<br>you you have to do in the very near<br>future tomorrow then I ask you be a<br>global<br>citizen do<br>not care much about your National<br>boundaries as President johnf Kennedy<br>said there is no National boundary now<br>there is only the question how you can<br>help others who are in need of your<br>support as I said borders have<br>practically lost its meaning at this<br>time in<br>this very dramatic transformation in<br>Global Communication and trade and<br>transportation then we are living in a<br>very small planet Earth this a planet<br>Earth may be very small tiny star in the<br>vastness of<br>universe then the answer<br>comes<br>naturally quickly that we are family of<br>this small planet world and we have to<br>work together as one family members<br>regardless of where you are coming from<br>what kind of person what kind of belief<br>you may have use your enormous power<br>connectivity to speak out and take<br>action be<br>Fearless in standing up to<br>Injustice build on generations of new<br>zealanders who have built a strong bond<br>with the United Nations and let us work<br>together all together uh to make this<br>world better form where everybody can<br>have a life of dignity and I thank you<br>for this opportunity and and thank you<br>for your commitment and Leadership I<br>you uh as Excellency has agreed to<br>take a few questions as the newest<br>graduate of the University of Oakland<br>he's indicated uh a particular<br>preference unsurprisingly given his<br>speech to hear from our students so I'm<br>going to in picking you out for<br>questions favor those of you who are<br>either students or look young enough to<br>be<br>students uh but it so happens that we've<br>prepared uh slightly for this and I have<br>three students organized who I'd like to<br>get us started we have ring mics and so<br>I can just look for salomi right from<br>salomi<br>T you speak of a partnership between the<br>and New Zealand how do you see the wider<br>Pacific region fitting into this<br>partnership and to what extent is it<br>dependent on the the politics of<br>particular governments in New Zealand<br>what if there are systematic changes in<br>policies or values would that affect the<br>sustainability of New Zealand in the<br>future uh this is a very important<br>question on this world uh while you<br>promote particular United Nations or<br>other countries uh promote your goals<br>for sustainable development particularly<br>then you need to forge a broader network<br>of<br>partnership uh one of the lessons which<br>I<br>learned as a Secretary General is that<br>without the strong partnership among<br>between and among<br>government business<br>communities and Civil Society these are<br>triarte partnership is very important if<br>you miss one of these pillar<br>then it will not work properly then<br>partnership between the governments<br>or only among the business may not be<br>sufficient therefore we need to have a<br>broadened partnership that's what United<br>Nations really are promoting uh for<br>example European Union is one of the<br>most very generous very active um<br>supporter for all this development<br>issues our commissioner is here then you<br>cannot always expect from Europe<br>European union or government or United<br>State or Japan who have been uh very<br>generous but you have to have business<br>communities now I am very much<br>encouraged that these business<br>communities in fact provide much much<br>more resources uh to United Nations<br>United Nations has a very tiny tiny<br>budget but most of the budget for un DP<br>UNICEF or wh they all come from private<br>sector of course in addition to<br>government government<br>resources I receive a lot of<br>humanitarian resources from private<br>sectors for Syrian refugees and<br>therefore we need to have such a<br>partnership if I may add one more is<br>that<br>partnership with academic<br>institutions as a Secretary General I<br>have established launched two<br>partnership very important one is global<br>Business Partnership known as a global<br>compact uh we have uh about 8,000 world<br>class business communities business SE<br>private sectors who are joining uh in<br>This Global compact I have initiated<br>United Nations academic<br>impact uh it has about 1,000<br>universities joining joining in this<br>that they may have some different<br>purposes first of all this business<br>communities they're not only pursuing<br>for their own<br>profit they have about 10 principles<br>like human rights good management<br>transparency anti-corruption and our<br>academic universities they are helping<br>United Nations<br>course and I very much glad that they<br>are the part of this United Nations work<br>therefore partnership is very important<br>uh I mentioned about my meeting in<br>samua there were hundreds of private<br>sectors came pledged to<br>support the small island developing<br>World developing countries and this is a<br>part of uh partnership then we need to<br>write the new chapter uh in Partnership<br>for our share the future and I hope<br>particular young students uh you have<br>this kind of vision of establishing and<br>forging a stronger and broader networks<br>youal<br>relations<br>thank you your Excellency for a great<br>talk and congratulations on your<br>honorary doctorate my question is do you<br>believe that the World Trade<br>Organization the international monetary<br>fund and the world bank's current<br>economic development approach and<br>policies of deregulation privatization<br>and trade liberalization for both Global<br>North and Global South countries need to<br>change to ensure confidence in the<br>global economy given that we live in a<br>post great re ession world with many<br>Global uprisings and revolts in addition<br>to ensuring that Economic Development<br>not<br>I I have received the doctoral honorary<br>economics I may need to receive another<br>doctoral degree on that<br>I may need a thesis on that but that's a<br>very important question when this world<br>is now going through still a very<br>turbulent economic and financial crisis<br>most of the European countries they are<br>supposed to be the richest countries but<br>they are still struggling and major big<br>biggest economic Powers they still<br>trying to reform uh and improve their<br>economic activities in that regard the<br>United Nations role has been appreciated<br>by the International Community like a<br>WTO IMF and World Bank and all other<br>organization they are the major agencies<br>and organizations who are really trying<br>to help World economy and going toward<br>the right<br>direction I as a Secretary General of<br>the United Nations I chair I'm the<br>chairman of um this what we call chief<br>chief executive board is abbreviated CB<br>and that's the small informal<br>organization where all the United<br>Nations specialized agencies including<br>WTO or bretonwood institutions like<br>World Bank and IMF and all other<br>organization which you know about United<br>Nations we really try to discuss this<br>matter in a concered and<br>comprehensive coordinated way uh all<br>these organizations Act was created and<br>act<br>independently by the member states but<br>the way they have to<br>do is aiming toward the proper<br>prosperity and coordinated way and<br>that's what I'm doing<br>and I take note what you said that we<br>need to have a very close coordination<br>among all these organizations so that we<br>can have much more effective and<br>efficient<br>um<br>uh plan of actions plan of actions uh to<br>make our economy better but for detailed<br>thesis<br>just like to uh to talk what uh your<br>sentiment on the Palestinian situation<br>um my question comes in response to the<br>sort of helpless um helplessness on the<br>part of the International Community into<br>in regards to Israel's Defiance of<br>international human humanitarian law so<br>my question is this do you believe there<br>should be a process of<br>democratization um of the UN structure<br>to ensure that it doesn't capitulate to<br>Global superpowers like that of the<br>you in dealing with all these human<br>right issues and humanitarian issues<br>our very strong and uh Charter found the<br>priority is that the human rights uh<br>should come first the United Nations<br>chter provides three pillars as I said<br>the peace and<br>security development and human rights<br>they are all inter related<br>interrelated if there is no peace and<br>security you cannot promote the<br>development if there is an absolute the<br>despair because of extreme poverty you<br>this creates a political instability<br>they will come to the street and protest<br>against the<br>government and therefore everything goes<br>interconnected I have been saying that<br>uh peace will be<br>sustainable only when there<br>is a development and development should<br>go hand inand with the peace and<br>security at the same time above all we<br>have to have human human rights<br>protected and our principle is clear as<br>I said human rights upfront everything<br>should be upfront when it comes to a<br>human right that we have a<br>many many institutions uh International<br>tribunal international criminal court<br>and we have established many tribunals<br>for special purposes and for all this<br>United Nations has been making clear<br>that we take actions actions for justice<br>so for all others tragedies which are<br>happening we will pursue that thank you<br>middle so congratulations your<br>Excellency on receiving this award much<br>deserved and well done my name is Denny<br>catula and I am an Iraqi New Zealander<br>here<br>and it is obvious you know the<br>devastation of you know what's going on<br>in Iraq um the people here are you know<br>devastated by the unimaginable crimes<br>that are being committed by the Islamic<br>State against the Christians and other<br>persecuted minorities I've got two<br>questions and a personal letter from our<br>um Community to you so the two questions<br>are what is the United Nations doing um<br>to<br>stop you know like to to stop the<br>Islamic State and to um help the<br>Christians and other minorities who are<br>being persecuted and the second thing is<br>what should the New Zealand government<br>do thank<br>you first of all uh your Korean is<br>perfect and I<br>appreciate uh pronunciation is very very<br>correct and I thank you for addressing<br>me in Korean<br>uh this is one of the most troubling<br>situation which we see in Iraq uh last<br>month uh I visit Iraq and I went to up<br>to kistan Regional<br>government it was just before this isil<br>crisis happened just before that at that<br>time then why I went to court the klg<br>kistan Regional government uh because we<br>saw that the there should be more<br>inclusive cooperation between and among<br>ethnicities the Iraq is largely divided<br>into three Sunni Shiite and<br>kistan I have been urging Iraqi leaders<br>pres Prime former prime minister<br>al-maliki and current president and the<br>current prime minister nominate and<br>met the religious leader in in naab<br>naab alistan you know Grand<br>Ayatollah I have been urging all<br>political leaders and religious leaders<br>that they should unite they should have<br>an inclusive politics and try to care<br>whatever ethnicity may be with all this<br>ISS taking a brutal terrorist activities<br>we have been just alarmed shocked by<br>what had happened I appreciate uh those<br>countries who have capacity and<br>resources are taking uh important you<br>know actions so that United Nations can<br>take humanitarian<br>actions we went to Mountain<br>sja the uncl has raised massive the<br>biggest operation humanitarian<br>operations about uh two weeks ago<br>bringing all humanitarian assistance and<br>with all this military air strike we<br>were able to let these people flee<br>unharmed and there should be<br>no discrimination between Christians<br>yajes and<br>turkomans there was some criticism that<br>Western world may be only helping<br>Christians Christian Community no it's<br>not true the United Nations have been<br>taking care of all Christians yaji<br>communities and Truman communities so we<br>are doing under the very difficult and<br>dangerous situations all what we have to<br>do so pleas please know that United<br>Nations as a<br>humanitarian agency and human rights<br>protector we are doing all what I can<br>now I often call<br>myself I'm the voice of voiceless people<br>I'm the defender of defenseless people<br>there are so many voiceless people there<br>so many defenseless people who cannot<br>defend themselves then it's only the<br>United Nations<br>impart with impartiality and neutrality<br>we can do our work this is what we are<br>doing but what is most important is that<br>it is Iraqi people and<br>leaders who have to be united only on<br>that International Community should show<br>solidarity this is what we are doing now<br>yeah ladies and gentlemen that we are uh<br>we're out of time have to take his<br>Excellency to his final engagement at<br>the University uh
