"Education is not a consumer product."<br><br>The group in particular opposes ongoing maximum fee rises, reduced access to loans and allowances, ongoing cuts to courses and staff, restrictions on academic freedoms and exclusion of students at high level university decisions.<br><br>The public event entitled "Neoliberalism and the University" will feature a number of guest speakers, including Sandra Grey, Teresia Teaiwa, John Dennison, Fleur Fitzsimons and a soap box style open mic. It is to take place in the newly refurbished Hub, a space which currently does not allow student events.<br><br>"The majority of the hub was funded by students", spokesperson Joshua James said. "The fact that it is run as a commercial space, and that outside of VUWSA, students are effectively barred from holding meetings here is ridiculous. We believe we have a right to meet and talk openly at our own campus about issues that affect us as students."<br><br>The event is to be held at the Hub, at Wellington's Kelburn campus at 2pm this Wednesday 23rd July.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;
