develop<br>relationships with families and with<br>women in particular and in time of<br>course babies came along<br>I'd done a lot of work on the war in the<br>Pacific in terms of the environmental<br>effects and to me human beings are part<br>of the environment so I was thinking<br>well how did how what happened to these<br>children what do we know about them they<br>are certainly<br>um the unknown part of the war there are<br>hundreds of books written about the war<br>the battle of terara the battle of guad<br>canal Cota trial what the New Zealand is<br>did here and there and so on um there<br>are all sorts of stories about hero<br>men's Heroes that were pilots and VCS<br>and fijians fighting in the jungle all<br>kinds of things but this more domestic<br>side and this human side has just<br>basically not been forgotten by the<br>people that it has affected but as far<br>as historians go no one that I'm aware<br>of has been interested enough to ask<br>whenever we history we potentially open<br>a Pandora's Box uh and we just have to<br>try and do the least harm to people<br>certainly to the living so I guess we're<br>opening wounds but we're also hoping<br>too I can't really tell you too much<br>about my mother's family I have read<br>they were one below the Aris the queens<br>or Kings of the cooks I was raised with<br>this family who had two other children<br>and we grew up as brothers and sisters<br>but always knowing that I wasn't<br>their um natural<br>brother when I started school I was<br>known as<br>Blackie and it wasn't until I was<br>probably five or six that someone said<br>he was named after his American father<br>Blackie that didn't really mean anything<br>to me at that stage I was eight or nine<br>and this woman came with her husband and<br>they were introduced to me as my<br>mother and her husband my stepfather Iva<br>Benson that was the first time I'd seen<br>either of them my<br>stepfather never accepted me<br>100% he did not spare the rod with me at<br>any stage he did<br>not and um<br>yeah unfortunately that's what I<br>remember about<br>him I can recall one incident<br>where I was being beaten by my<br>stepfather when I actually cried out for<br>my father I do recall that year and um I<br>probably got a greater be as a<br>consequence of it but um that was<br>probably the only time I ever cried out<br>for<br>him in about<br>19 63 late 1963 I had finished my high<br>school<br>education and I had made application to<br>join the Royal Australian Navy I applied<br>using the name Arthur<br>taono the Navy came back and said well<br>we need a birth<br>certificate<br>I went to my mother and said I need a<br>birth<br>certificate and when I finally got this<br>birth certificate it said Arthur black<br>baren my mother explained to me that I<br>was the child of her love with this<br>American serviceman who served in<br>atuy and that he had passed away in<br>career and that's about as far as it<br>for as long as I can remember at least<br>as far back as four or five my father<br>had always talked about his other child<br>in the South Pacific he T he talked<br>about it all the time or at least when<br>my mother would let him I just heard it<br>in in conversations that he would have<br>with his family or with my mother when<br>he thought I wasn't<br>listening<br>um you know just there was this child<br>out there and I think he felt bad<br>that that you know he wasn't a part of<br>our life my mother did not want<br>to raise another woman's child we have<br>another woman's child in her<br>house and her comment was if you want<br>another child I'll give you one and<br>that's how we got Joanne a year later it<br>was never a secret never ever<br>um he he by the time I was born I<br>believe everybody was pretty close to<br>hitting<br>adulthood uh I was just told that I had<br>a brother in the in somewhere on the<br>other side of the world and when he came<br>knen to treat him<br>nicely my father had filled out<br>paternity papers before he left the<br>island because he knew she are his<br>mother was pregnant so he filled out<br>paternity<br>forms and then my father<br>tried<br>him my father had been sending money on<br>a regular basis there not a lot of money<br>we didn't have a lot of money but he<br>would send money on a regular basis<br>there and then it got to a point where<br>they were actually asking for<br>money but they wouldn't let him come<br>here they wouldn't tell my father where<br>he was so my father his family finally<br>decided enough is enough you know this<br>is taking a toll on you it's upsetting<br>your wife it's ups you know everything<br>is an uproar so it's just time for this<br>to be over so my uncle my Uncle<br>Dave wrote a letter to the tribal Chief<br>and said my father is dead and there's<br>not going to be any more<br>money that was the end really and that<br>was the end of that my father was kind<br>while but after that there was no more<br>adoption and then it was just you know<br>he would just tell a stories over the<br>always sorry he would always um talk<br>about him it's like this an emptiness in<br>his<br>heart before my 50th birthday my<br>daughter said dad why don't you try and<br>find out about your Dad we did a bit of<br>research and we found an arur black<br>baren living in gron Blanc in<br>number several times I rang that number<br>or tried to ring that number but I could<br>never bring myself to push the last<br>what a lot of reservations um did did he<br>have a family I<br>mean did he tell his family about<br>me how would I be<br>received<br>and I may have taken the easy way out<br>but I didn't want to upset another<br>family I just I just let it<br>be we we didn't know if it was my father<br>but just just let it be and it stayed<br>that way<br>until 18 months ago in January of 20<br>2010 um a newspaper article appeared on<br>the front page of the New Zealand<br>Herald and my son read it and it<br>was about a research study that had<br>been in the process of being conducted<br>by the history Department of Notaro<br>University and they were<br>looking into the effects or what<br>happened to children who had been left<br>behind by American<br>serviceman my son and I spoke about this<br>and I said well ring them and let's see<br>what<br>happens within 12 hours the doors had<br>been open it<br>was the arthur black baren that I had<br>for<br>okay<br>we can't go past uh security<br>right be okay this is co cool we've been<br>waiting our whole lives

lovely to be<br>good there your children he always<br>lovely it's been worth every hour that<br>okay<br>hello Stuart where's my<br>nephew see<br>my Tony<br>hello and what is this that's the<br>original that Dad signed oh the<br>paternity form this to me is is<br>um that's what's really kept me going<br>the fact that he did that he was willing<br>to do<br>that willing to put his name to an<br>unborn child it just just shared a lot<br>of Courage he signed up are you aware he<br>signed up to spend six more months there<br>so he could stay with your mom I still<br>can't understand why he was dragged<br>out why me neither US Army they do what<br>they want we have some things to return<br>to you and 60 years this time are you<br>sure you want to give them away yeah no<br>we're not giving him away we're sending<br>him home we have coconut shell<br>ukuleles oh that's with with the island<br>with the island name in mother of<br>pearl you can give it to that freance<br>who does to restore it years ago when he<br>first brought them home they were wired<br>with American tele telephone wire from<br>the<br>gis this one I'm absolutely positive<br>that your mother<br>arur I have one more thing for you okay<br>this is a bottle of Scotch he told me to<br>put up in case we ever found you have<br>this so this is 40y old what no like we<br>like 60 really was battled in the 50s

right field<br>and second wow you must have a good arm<br>what is an RBI I hit the ball and<br>someone goes in for a score no but what<br>is what is the<br>initi Run is I need to know this when we<br>go and watch the Indians<br>RBI you teaching Cricket do you play<br>cricket I love Cricket but it's it's a<br>very confusing game to try and teach<br>anyone who's not<br>English because basically to go and play<br>cricket first of all you got to go out<br>and when you get out you've got to stay<br>in while the other team tries to get you<br>out when they get you out you have to go<br>in and someone else comes<br>already one of the questions that was<br>asked of Me by the team in New Zealand<br>was did I feel any anger and I don't I<br>don't feel any anger at all I've had a<br>had an experience that I wouldn't like<br>anyone else to go through but I'm not in<br>the least bit angry to<br>anybody I'm just grateful for what's<br>happened in the last 18 months I really<br>am grateful my closure will be at the<br>there it<br>are we found ether and he's<br>back<br>please I'm so pleased to be<br>here we going to leave you all alone for<br>a little while so you can have a talk<br>dead<br>so close we were so close to<br>close but I'm<br>glad that<br>finally we are<br>together<br>me and thank you for leaving things<br>me I shall come back again to see you<br>that I promise and I'll bring the rest<br>well<br>okay<br>okay I'm sorry we didn't find you sooner<br>not it's not a it's no longer a problem<br>here armies and Military tend to<br>discourage marriages during<br>wartime and therefore if they had<br>married out in sore or somewhere Cook<br>Islands they would not have been able to<br>get back to America because the marriage<br>wasn't recognized now these laws changed<br>after the war in 1947 48 but at that<br>time uh the US authorities and the<br>commanders just what would not give<br>marriages<br>in the<br>Navy and I I was a first builder of<br>wvuv<br>I can't imagine how it has grown and how<br>much I appreciate coming back to see and<br>I wish I could see each and every one of<br>you and greet you I left home at the age<br>of 13 and worked on the cattle ranch for<br>5 years before I went in the Navy I<br>never missed the meal in my life but I<br>postponed a lot of<br>them here comes fify and her girlfriends<br>and they wanted to sit and listen to the<br>music<br>okay so we sat listen to the music and<br>pretty soon they started finding their<br>friends and going away and she lived<br>right there next door and she come down<br>and she said listen to the music all<br>time eventually we made music<br>together well she Not only was a<br>beautiful woman but she had a she had a<br>beautiful disposition and she was always<br>doing things for other people and and<br>everything like that and then uh then we<br>got married in September the 10th of<br>1942 I think everybody knows now that<br>reads through the history that in 1942<br>the Navy was not allowing<br>marriages um in this region but my<br>parents met in 1942 fell in love in 1942<br>and wish to be married and they were<br>able to talk their Minister into<br>marrying them I got the precious Bible<br>you know that they have where they<br>pledged my father basically pledging<br>himself to my mom and as far as they<br>were concerned in the eyes of the Lord<br>they were<br>married all was fine until my father was<br>deployed and oh I think trying to come<br>back to be with my mom or trying to<br>secure funds for my Mom calling her his<br>wife which in their eyes she was the<br>Navy didn't acknowledge it didn't<br>acknowledge the marriage basically so it<br>caused them some some problems in 1943<br>she was pregnant Lee was born in January<br>of<br>44 and I went to file papers<br>to a lot her money out of my paycheck to<br>automatically go to<br>her and that they started out they<br>accepted everything went long couple<br>months later all my my check paycheck<br>all my pay was coming to me and I<br>started<br>wondering I didn't find out until I went<br>back there after the war they discharged<br>me in September 26 1945 in jackville<br>Florida give me 5 cents a mile to Dallas<br>Texas for travel<br>expenses I said no according to Navy<br>regulations according to<br>law I was in entitled to come back to my<br>home which was in s<br>more they said you'd either take this 5<br>cents a mile and get out of here or<br>we're going to take you to Bethesda<br>Maryland and use you for<br>experiments I said give me my<br>Nickles it didn't really surprise me<br>that the Navy had tried to do that what<br>did surprise me was the degree to which<br>he went to to fight the Navy on that and<br>get us out of there and keep our family<br>together he was told that he didn't have<br>permit he didn't have permission to come<br>back and he didn't have any business<br>there didn't have any reason to be back<br>in Sall he was told Navy said you have<br>no business back there so they weren't<br>going to help him and I wrote to the VFW<br>V the Foreign Wars told him my<br>problem the next thing I got was a<br>letter from a secretary of state James F<br>Burns and in that letter he had a<br>sent<br>me a blank App application for<br>passport a description of the<br>photographs that's required I says then<br>send me a $10 money order and I'll see<br>what I can<br>do so I filled this thing out and took<br>it out and mailed it to him and went on<br>back to work came from work and hanging<br>on my door is a note that's go down to<br>the post office you have some important<br>mail that you have to sign for and I got<br>it and open it up and here is a<br>passport and attached to that passport<br>is an official letter signed by James F<br>burn it says all US embassies consel and<br>other representatives of the United<br>States are directed to assist the Bear<br>by any means of transportation any route<br>that he wants to take to rejoin his<br>family in America some<br>more we got down to uh Simone and<br>pulling up the dock I had not had any<br>way to tell fify that I am home she was<br>surprised and I don't know how happy she<br>was uh but she was surprised and I do<br>remember that that night uh I I knew<br>that the kids loved Marbles and so I had<br>two bags of<br>marbles and that night we us to and<br>sitting up in the house and down below<br>was uh underneath the<br>house Lee got sleepy and we we've been<br>talking and talking and talking ever<br>since I'd been back he say it's time<br>from time for Mo you have to go now he's<br>talking in<br>someone and I said go where do I go this<br>this is where I came to oh no said me<br>and my mother live here alone you cannot<br>stay<br>here and I said well I got no no other<br>place to go where can I go he said you<br>can sleep under the<br>house and so then I got idea I pulled<br>out one of the two bags of marbles I had<br>and I gave him that oh man he love those<br>marble and then I had to pay the second<br>bag of marbles before I could<br>stay there's no indigenous people on<br>Wake Island so the people who came to<br>Wake Island to work<br>we're generally from Hawaii the<br>Philippines uh so there was a lot of<br>diversity there but there never never<br>once felt any sense of prejudice while<br>while we were living in the island not<br>not ever in the Pacific we didn't feel<br>unusual at all it's a Melting Pot of all<br>kinds of people we were like everybody<br>else as far as we were concerned<br>perfectly<br>normal my first recollection of sensing<br>Prejudice was when we went back to my<br>dad's home we went to a u swimming<br>pool we having a family reunion and all<br>of his family was there of course they<br>they're all white uh and so our cousins<br>went jumped in the pool and my<br>mom and U said let's let's go over to<br>the pool and we tried to get into the<br>swimming pool and the guy wouldn't let<br>us and my dad came over and said what's<br>the problem and the guy said uh we don't<br>let those kind in here you sir can come<br>in but they can't they said well that's<br>my family what do you mean there so he<br>kind of you know laid it on the guy and<br>I think as I understand it he he almost<br>uh got into a fist fight with a<br>guy but eventually we got to go swimming<br>in the pool but that was my first sense<br>of that that I ever had any sensing that<br>we were thought of as being different in<br>in the sense of our skin color or or our<br>ethnic background and anything like that<br>we had a good life and I think living in<br>the Pacific region was probably key to<br>that and we didn't have to experience<br>negativity because of the color of our<br>skin mom was a<br>very I would have to say private person<br>she never completely gave up her Samoan<br>identity and was very proud of being<br>Samoan but she was also<br>very maybe grateful uh to Liv in the<br>American society the way she did and<br>being able to do things she she did I<br>think my dad probably mentioned that she<br>loved to travel she probably never would<br>have had those opportunities as she<br>married a someone man stayed here my<br>mother maintained her Sone culture<br>throughout her life she adapted to<br>Western ways but internally her values<br>her Customs stayed very some on uh so<br>she tried to raise me that<br>way I was unable to do what most<br>children and young women women in<br>particular were able to do in the<br>Western World you know at at at age 16<br>you know I mean I'm not dating I'm not<br>going out if I'm going out I'm going out<br>with her on Sunday if there's a a<br>softball game or a baseball game that<br>everyone even at the church is going to<br>that<br>coming back here I was excited about it<br>I didn't know what to expect really I<br>mean I'd heard about the place and I<br>kind of had an idea that the climate and<br>everything would be like this and that<br>the people would be as friendly as they<br>are uh knowing the SS that I<br>know but to<br>actually see the places where I was born<br>and they meet right under that mango<br>tree where I lived<br>uhhuh that was really something I I I I<br>can't really find words to describe it<br>it's it was just<br>um sense of coming home building<br>finally back to my<br>roots as a little girl I thought where's<br>the to of cloth where's the to of cloth<br>on the wall you know where's the<br>language uh I wanted to be more I guess<br>like my mother when I was little I felt<br>like I was a lot like my dad I wanted to<br>be more like my mom I used to think I'm<br>half and half but I feel like I'm only<br>given this one side to<br>develop fin back your mom would have<br>wanted<br>that<br>yeah<br>my only regret is I never made it here<br>excuse but she's there she<br>like okay you finally made<br>me I never will<br>forget<br>you<br>some<br>I never will<br>forget<br>you in some Island there was shame<br>attached to it because you know you've<br>had this child and the man's gone why is<br>this um or perhaps a daughter did not<br>act according to the morals of that<br>family this may be particularly so where<br>some people are pretty fervent<br>Christians and so when that that<br>happened it was a<br>disgrace and um so that was a a thing of<br>Silence in their<br>society but the children brought up in<br>today's world have slightly broader<br>concept of these things and are not so<br>judgmental I think of the situation as<br>perhaps their great grandparents would<br>have been and they're very<br>curious and I think it's just a<br>wonderful thing to know even if the<br>knowledge isn't always<br>wonderful<br>mom was married from<br>taranaki early days with our<br>mom wasn't the very best uh being a mom<br>looking after triplets without the<br>support from anybody was um extremely<br>hard for my mom uh<br>she didn't bring us up as good as uh as<br>other moms I would say she was pretty<br>cruel and things like that she didn't<br>have a lot to do with us because she you<br>know only times like she used to spend a<br>bit of money used to go to the pub and<br>things like that and<br>um so for the triplets it really was<br>just each and every one of us looking<br>after each other and doing our thing and<br>um just hoping and praying when Mom came<br>back from a little stint in the pub that<br>we weren't going to<br>you know be beaten for something that we<br>didn't think we' you know would done you<br>it it it it was pretty tough we didn't<br>have any shoes and uh we were in the<br>sort of old clothes that we always used<br>to be in covered in SS and scabs big<br>tummies<br>malnutrition all of us had a a sickness<br>with malnutrition lack of food Graham<br>was extremely sick and it wasn't it was<br>through the doctors that um got in touch<br>with the social welfare and the police<br>department too they couldn't do anything<br>at the time while we were living with M<br>but on the first day of our schooling<br>years if you'd like to call it we turned<br>five and going to school um we were<br>greeted by the social welfare department<br>and the police and uh we were taken away<br>and placed into care and and and that<br>was pretty pretty tough because mom's<br>last words to us was<br>um jump over the bridge and don't come<br>home and she actually got her<br>wish we had seven different welfare<br>homes that we went into and each and<br>every one of them had families of their<br>own and the<br>triplets we had to look after their<br>children as they went out to various<br>places and drinking and things like that<br>and at that age we were too young to<br>look after children we had to cook food<br>for the children and that was pretty<br>pretty tough and we got<br>beaten gr had his leg boiled they put<br>his leg in a bucket of hot water and<br>scolded his leg and I got beaten up<br>pretty badly and this is at least 3 and<br>a half to four years that we had this<br>transition of<br>different uh foster homes until we come<br>to a foster home in a little town called<br>TCO now TCO is in the Bay of Plenty it's<br>a 3/4 an hour trip from ru<br>Toco get out of the van we get home and<br>we up we look at this towering man all<br>of<br>6'4 very very<br>solid as we found he was a 1935 36 marry<br>all<br>black really distinguished<br>person first thing he says to his his<br>wife what the bloody hell have you<br>brought here cuz we were covered in<br>SCE and everything you we were in pretty<br>bad<br>shape so I looked at my other two<br>brothers and I thought gee<br>was I wonder what's going to happen<br>now they had a mixed Farm<br>cows to milk pigs to feed sheep horses<br>and all that it was ideal for the<br>triplet and<br>um yeah everything turned around Mr and<br>Mrs Kaho whle were just<br>fabulous I can't express how much they<br>actually meant to us really they um if<br>it wasn't for them God knows who we<br>she was in a mendal Institute and she<br>was at our 21st birthday after all those<br>years she was schopen double<br>natured uh and and very<br>um very sort of very Snappy and and that<br>might just be due to all the the<br>medication and things that she was on<br>but we greeted her<br>and her name was nah n g h i n a and I<br>didn't greet her as<br>Mom we just greeted her as<br>nah and<br>um yeah Mom had a tear in her eye when<br>she saw us cuz um I think the hardest<br>thing would have been for her to leave<br>us but you know um we we' chosen well<br>the Whit Le had done everything for us<br>and and I I I we were just going to stay<br>yeah<br>at some stage of Our Lives we were told<br>that our father was an American<br>Marine I feel very sure that all of you<br>man are going to enjoy your stay here in<br>New Zealand very<br>much<br>you'll find that you'll like new<br>zealanders or most of them and that's<br>the new zealanders will like you or most<br>of<br>you<br>American servicemen were seen to be a<br>problematic part of New Zealand Society<br>in the 1940s because they brought money<br>and glamour um and they stole New<br>Zealand woman from New Zealand soldiers<br>um they were the cause of divorce they<br>caused all these social disruptions in<br>New Zealand<br>Society under the law New Zealand women<br>if they had a child born out of woodlock<br>were not required to to name the father<br>on the birth certificate so we can never<br>know we'll never know because of the way<br>in which the archive Works in that case<br>how many children were born fathered by<br>American servicemen uh during that<br>period the illegitimacy rate goes up<br>rapidly during the time that American<br>servicemen are in New Zealand and so as<br>rate<br>I said mom did you know a lot about my<br>dad she said um not not a lot but she<br>said you look exactly the same as your<br>dad she had a<br>letter didn't show me what was in the<br>letter a letter from her from<br>Dad so I don't know what was in the<br>letter but there was a name on the back<br>of the letter so we thought that our<br>father's name was spelled g e a n g<br>e<br>Gan in the back of this<br>letter was the correct spelling of the<br>gang on this particular day this is the<br>9th of September 1999 all the<br>nines I get another letter from the<br>American<br>Marines and as usual I I'd mow the lawn<br>Glen said have a cup of tea was sitting<br>outside in the sun what have you done<br>with the letter oh I said I'll just put<br>it in the trash so well you better bring<br>it and we'll open it up and he opened it<br>and this little bit of paper fluted out<br>down to the floor and I went down to<br>pick it up and I looked at it and I just<br>started<br>crying and the first thing we opened the<br>letter was was this picture this little<br>just he only had a very very short stay<br>in New Zealand he was here on the 17th<br>of June had a bit of Von AR and he left<br>on the 23rd of June 1943 there were<br>thousands of Americans that had come to<br>New Zealand and I know that he he went<br>to Oakland and um yeah just had a<br>fleeting romance with my mother just a<br>sort of one night stand and U and then<br>the hard part was Finding getting his<br>phone number and all that and and I<br>couldn't wait I couldn't wait to ring I<br>was just because everything was there<br>the whole paper<br>had Kenneth Joseph gang when he was born<br>his wife's name Rosemary gang where they<br>were right down to the size boot that he<br>wore all the troop carriers that brought<br>unbelievable and uh I said I don't know<br>how to put put this to you Daniel but I<br>said your father is also my father and<br>he says go God he said are you guys for<br>real and prior to this all going<br>away so you know me ringing Halfway<br>Around the<br>World mother's just passed away and you<br>say that I'm your brother it was a hard<br>thing for them to swallow I said Daniel<br>now that I know that my dad has passed<br>away and that I have half siblings over<br>in<br>America what I do is that I will<br>compile photographs of the triplets from<br>day one up to the present date put them<br>all in a separate envelope but put them<br>in one and send it to<br>you and I put a little note in it that<br>if you we would like<br>to get to know the likes and the<br>dislikes of my<br>dad but if you don't I'd understand that<br>I really would seal it send it<br>off about 3 weeks to a month later was<br>unbelievable the emails the phone calls<br>and this voice is America God damn he<br>says there's no doubting that you guys<br>are our brothers because you look more<br>and now we're all together as one family<br>and it's just been wonderful I can't<br>it's hard to express it in words and I<br>know it's probably doubly hard for<br>them because they wondered for so long<br>who their father<br>was I think it was Daniel has said if<br>their mom if she had it known about the<br>triplets earlier that she would have got<br>us over there too she was a saint and I<br>got I got to look at this guy right here<br>and I thought oh my God my dance back<br>for a couple of weeks this is really<br>cool and I and I really thought John<br>couldn't look any more like my dad than<br>uh I could have possibly imagined until<br>the next day when this guy came into the<br>airport and I thought oh no that's<br>Dad I really wanted to find out a lot<br>about my dad you know just the likes and<br>dislikes and um that was really on my<br>mind and uh I didn't never ever knew<br>what my dad did<br>never but we're over there and uh we<br>were uh having sing song and things like<br>that and we were doing<br>things like tapping on you like this or<br>just doing things and the American<br>family are standing behind us with tears<br>streaming down their faces saying dad is<br>back on vacation we were doing the same<br>things as my dad which I never knew and<br>boy that that<br>was hard to compromise but but it was it<br>really touched my heart you know knowing<br>that we did something that I never ever<br>knew that my dad did that he did when<br>they grew up you know it this yeah David<br>and Daniel and yeah just tears streaming<br>down their faces yeah<br>I was used to my family um we had a unit<br>here was<br>unbreakable uh we had a wonderful<br>wonderful father very um<br>loving very<br>providing um but then I got to<br>thinking life's pretty short to be<br>selfish so I thought if it were<br>true that I did have brothers elsewhere<br>I thought well I'll welcome into my<br>heart and um that was tough for<br>realized in my heart I thought with my<br>father was<br>M when that band door<br>opened I look through Michael's<br>eyes there was no dispute that<br>you are my<br>you hearing hearing the my brothers and<br>especially Tommy talk about the fact<br>that he was a caring and I can just<br>imagine you know and um that's the sort<br>of things that I missed growing up to<br>have a father that was caring a mother<br>that was caring and that I'm sort of I<br>I know that being brought up in a marry<br>Community myself went to school and high<br>school surrounded by mared<br>people and their feelings towards the<br>family are very very close extremely<br>close to the fact that um you moms and<br>dads they have their family they you<br>know have children and uh as their<br>children grow and have children of their<br>their own and uh things break up their<br>families will take the children look<br>after them and bring them up into the<br>world very close and as I grew up I<br>couldn't understand why my mother and um<br>her family never took the triplets and<br>brought them up into their world you<br>know<br>um it's still really really sort of<br>hurts me a little bit that they they<br>didn't do that<br>um yeah but uh<br>we'll see another story about that I<br>would say with uh why mom left and the<br>reason why she left and the reason why<br>they didn't take her back um yeah yeah<br>part we don't know a great deal about<br>these women these indigenous women and<br>what their lives were like during war<br>why they came to the cities for instance<br>why did Mighty woman many mighty woman<br>come into Wellington during war what<br>were the motivations did they leave<br>Family behind did they want to get away<br>from restrictive parents did they want<br>to go and find Freedom and Independence<br>and get a job uh in in the cities did<br>they want to go and find love and<br>romance and excitement they wanted to<br>escape the life of a country girl and<br>live in the city and have an exciting<br>life and sometimes meet American<br>servicemen I think when you're talking<br>about Marty especially family is very<br>important and maintaining connections to<br>family is very important no matter where<br>you end up and so it would be unusual in<br>fact to disconnect yourself completely<br>from that life and from your past so in<br>most cases which I've been looking at<br>where the children are born if they're<br>born out of woodlock there is a sense of<br>Shame attached to it and that's where<br>is<br>hello how are you good long time it is a<br>long time now see good to see you you<br>too hello<br>Peter lovely lovely to see you hi Peter<br>how are you I'm good boy yeah good to<br>see you too lovely to see you when Mom<br>come to stay with you did she have<br>anything to do with their brothers and<br>sisters at that stage very little yeah<br>so some of them come to see her um very<br>rarely very rarely very very rarely did<br>Judy know any like in in the early<br>stages of our like did I suppose she may<br>not have been old enough<br>to you know find out about Mom you<br>trying to find the triplets you know oh<br>yeah no no no she wouldn't have been old<br>enough yeah no um I can just imagine<br>they were U every time um they she made<br>uh inquiries she was told to mind her<br>own business<br>virtually yeah it's nothing to do with<br>you if they want to get in touch with<br>you they'll find a<br>way and she often often found especially<br>relationship and she couldn't ask any<br>other family no because that was<br>taboo oh you don't talk about your<br>mother yeah or them them you was known<br>boy us yeah you don't talk about them<br>yeah yeah yeah<br>wow was absolutely nothing to do with<br>your mother yeah it was the family<br>so the family had no idea at all oh that<br>you was uh who your father was all right<br>all they knew is yeah that you was born<br>wouldn't have mattered back then it<br>wouldn't have<br>mattered it wouldn't matter because he<br>was a<br>promised she was a promised bride and<br>she put put shame on the Family<br>so um a natural fact they both both<br>sisters brought shame on the family CU<br>apparently they were both<br>promised and they neither one wanted to<br>marry the ones that they was promised to<br>away so no it wouldn't have mattered um<br>had they had<br>been cousins or you know same same tribe<br>that produced your it wouldn't have<br>mattered you still brought shame your<br>mom brought shame on the family that was<br>all yeah she was brought up with the<br>rest of her you know siblings brothers<br>and sisters in<br>opaki so their mom and dad's home was<br>there the king yeah okay and and<br>she couldn't be buried in a mar maret<br>yeah we asked for the family if she<br>could be taken to Nei to the p and we<br>was told<br>no she weren't allowed to be given a<br>Mary<br>funeral<br>mhm and she's buried now in<br>yeah hello Mom hello<br>you<br>yeah<br>well Mom
