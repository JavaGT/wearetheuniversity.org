generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>atago good evening everyone on behalf of<br>the University of itago I would like to<br>warmly welcome you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture um this is the time<br>as you know during the week when we all<br>take time out of our busy lives and<br>simply take an opportunity to listen and<br>to<br>learn as usual it's fantastic to see see<br>so many of our staff and our students<br>here as well as members of the general<br>public I'd like to extend a particularly<br>warm welcome to a number of people who<br>are in the audience this evening<br>including uh Professor crump's wife and<br>their fourth and brand new two-week old<br>baby which I've not yet spotted but I'm<br>suspect we might hear from at some point<br>during the rest of this evening's<br>proceedings um and also his parents um<br>who have traveled here from marbor uh to<br>be with him this evening and I'd also<br>like to extend a very warm welcome to<br>Stuart and Marilyn McKinley who have<br>made the McKinley chair in global Health<br>possible this evening we're all here to<br>benefit from the wisdom of Professor<br>Crump and to celebrate in his<br>success now when it comes to academic<br>staff here at the University of itago<br>our goal is always to recruit the best<br>and the brightest from New Zealand and<br>around the world and every once in a<br>while we can actually do both at the<br>same time John Crump is actually a<br>native kiwi he was educated here uh at<br>the University of itago but he has also<br>traveled and worked extensively around<br>the world but fortunately for us after<br>all that travel he's decided that<br>there's no place like<br>home so we feel extremely privileged to<br>have the opportunity to welcome John<br>back to itago a privilege that was<br>actually made possible by the McKinley<br>now I've had the chance to take a sneak<br>peek at John's slides for this evening<br>not many uh professors actually run them<br>by me before they present them um but I<br>did take the opportunity to look at them<br>uh and I think that we are all in for a<br>treat John's research is a very clear<br>and poignant example of the way in which<br>Chago academics use their expertise to<br>increase human health around the world<br>now from time to time I'm sure every one<br>in this audience has complained about<br>our Health Care system in New Zealand<br>but I'm pretty sure if nothing else you<br>will leave tonight feeling<br>extraordinarily<br>Lucky in closing I am very proud once<br>again to call Professor John Crump one<br>of our own John welcome back and<br>congratulations on your well-earned<br>chair and I will now call on Professor<br>Barry Taylor the dean of the Denine<br>school of medicine to tell us a bit more<br>about John's journey to becoming the<br>McKinley professor of of global<br>Health thank<br>you this is always a fascinating thing<br>when you uh come to introduce somebody<br>and then you try and find out what they<br>really like um so apart from reading a<br>CV and talking to him<br>directly um I've tried to try and<br>understand the the I guess the journey<br>that he's gone to to get there and some<br>of it's um dry but um the majority of it<br>the majority of is of of it is not so<br>the the dry stuff is mbchb 1993 F racp<br>or Fellowship of the Royal College of<br>physician in<br>1997 the uh a similar Fellowship in<br>pathology which is quite unusual and<br>actually really important in 2004 and an<br>MD submitted and and awarded in<br>2013 um and as Halen has mentioned a a a<br>basic University uh of a TGO degree<br>during which I note that uh one of the<br>features of our Medical training is an<br>elective period usually for 3 months and<br>that in fact he took his elective in<br>Kenya and that will probably become<br>relevant as we go through he finished<br>his degree did his house surgeon year in<br>Christ Church then went to London and uh<br>worked at the London School of hyan and<br>tropical medicine and during that did<br>his first research fellow job uh<br>actually in South Africa uh and um and I<br>guess got a second Taste of uh of<br>international Health work at that stage<br>came back uh to Christ Church as a um a<br>regist then kber as an infectious<br>disease regist uh and then went to Juke<br>University in the USA uh where he<br>continued on with the Infectious Disease<br>theme and then after a year there joined<br>the CDC as the epidemic intelligence<br>officer now what a wonderful name I like<br>that and and went and talking to him I I<br>realized that in fact it was an exciting<br>thing single at this stage able to go<br>all over the world and in fact the CDC<br>is well known for assisting uh all<br>countries of the world uh that actually<br>have epidemics evolving and a critically<br>important uh Organization for the world<br>so in that role um he indeed worked on<br>one of the most famous uh sort of um<br>modern episodes uh around the anthrax<br>scare which many of you will still<br>remember and in fact I note that he<br>received a distinguished service award<br>uh because of the work that he actually<br>did as part of that Anthrax<br>investigation there's some stories to<br>tell which I don't think which we'll<br>have to be after tonight because he's<br>not going to talk about that at this<br>particular uh um uh<br>lecture so now he sits as the McKinley<br>professor of global health and<br>co-director of the center for<br>international Health at the University<br>of atago uh I should really acknowledge<br>again Stuart and Marilyn uh McKinley for<br>endow that Sher thank you very much<br>you'll see I think how important it is<br>but it's not his only role he also is uh<br>got an appointment as an Adjunct<br>professor of medicine pathology and<br>Global Health at Juke University and<br>continues that<br>Association uh and perhaps even more<br>important continues as a medical a<br>formal medical epidemiologist with a CDC<br>in and in the states he has 121 refereed<br>Publications and two book<br>chapters and this man as far as I can<br>tell has lived and worked in Africa<br>mainly Tanzania but also Kenya Myanmar<br>Egypt Asia and central Africa he's an<br>infectious disease expert um especially<br>dealing with infection in low resource<br>countries um his topic is fascinating to<br>me I spent some time in Africa not very<br>long ago and saw the real um the real uh<br>human tragedy that in fact he's going to<br>talk about in the rest of this lecture<br>all right good evening um I'd like to<br>start by thanking you for coming along<br>um and of course the university for the<br>opportunity to deliver this lecture um I<br>also Echo the thanks to the McKinley for<br>the support um for my position without<br>which I wouldn't be here um it's both a<br>delight and a challenge um to explain my<br>area of interest to a broad audience um<br>my young children who I'll say say under<br>six and under um I think understand my<br>work as flying on Jets and playing on my<br>computer um and this evening um I've<br>added dressing up like a guy from the<br>Middle Ages uh so I hope I do a a a<br>better job of explaining myself to you<br>than perhaps I have to my<br>children um I'm going to be talking<br>about fever in the tropics um an<br>interesting Prospect during a week when<br>the weather here has reminded us we're<br>one degree latitude closer to the South<br>Pole in the equator um but I hope it um<br>at least transports you somewhere else<br>while um so a patient with fever U poses<br>a diagnostic challenge anywhere in the<br>world um but especially in the tropics<br>where fever is one of the most common<br>reasons for seeking Health Care this<br>patient's been admitted to a District<br>Hospital in an African country and the<br>temperature chart shows that she's had<br>fever for several days<br>the challenge arises because fever is a<br>symptom of many infections and even some<br>non-infectious diseases and they're<br>difficult to distinguish from one<br>another um just by taking a history and<br>examining the<br>patient without knowing the cause of<br>fever we don't know best how to treat<br>her um and in low resource areas the<br>problems compounded uh by the Limited<br>number of healthcare workers extremely<br>high patient volumes and few diagnostic<br>laboratory services<br>by way of contrast though um this<br>patient's problem does not pose a<br>diagnostic challenge this man from a<br>forested region of Gabon has a worm<br>migrating underneath the outer layer of<br>his<br>eye this can really only be one<br>infection it's lower lower a worm that<br>infects soft tissues and bloodstream um<br>of people living in affected areas<br>following the bite of a mango<br>fly by contrast with the patient with<br>fever in the previous slide uh this<br>presentation of loasis is a diagnosis<br>that can be made with a high degree of<br>certainty on the spot with limited<br>support now the history of fever and<br>medicine is very ancient um and I don't<br>plan to start at the beginning um<br>instead since we're discussing fever in<br>the tropics I thought I'd pick up the<br>story with this gentleman you might<br>recognize him this is David Livingston<br>who was born in 1813 in blanty Scotland<br>the bicentenary of his birth was marked<br>last year as you'll know Livingston<br>spent from 1841 until his death in<br>1873 in the interior of central and<br>southern Africa he explored the zambesi<br>river and its tributaries and he died um<br>in present day Zambia with fever and<br>dentry after joining uh the effort to<br>discover the source of the<br>Nile he was a keen Observer of many<br>things and he keep kept detail Rec<br>records both of his own health and the<br>health of his colleagues and workers his<br>observations are relevant to the<br>understanding of fever and its causes<br>150 years years ago and it's worth um<br>looking at the Western view of fever um<br>at that time to highlight what's changed<br>since so I'll just uh entertain you with<br>a bit of history for a minute this uh<br>1792 shows um agu the RoR or shaking<br>chill is a snake wrapped around the<br>patient who's trying to warm himself in<br>front of the fire um alongside fever a<br>hot at this time um fever was largely<br>considered to be a single disease um to<br>the extent uh being of being referred to<br>including by Livingston as the fever<br>although some uh further subclassified<br>the fever based on patient exposures the<br>pattern of fever and other symptoms and<br>signs notably at this time the fever was<br>not understood to be caused by<br>germs um but by a range of patient and<br>environmental<br>factors this conception of fever had its<br>roots in the Greek View From the time of<br>hypocrates and galin um that diseases<br>have natural causes but also from<br>earlier ideas of fever as a punishment<br>meated by Angry gods and retribution for<br>bad behavior in his writings Livingston<br>frequently identifies diet uh and moral<br>factors like active exercise and hard<br>work uh fresh air and cooler climates is<br>protective against the fever uh but he<br>also identifies that bad air such as<br>found in Marshy environments and hot<br>climates was responsible for causing<br>fever this concept of disease uh being<br>caused by noxious air was called the<br>miasma<br>Theory so we can boil down Livingston's<br>conception of fever as a single disease<br>uh caused by en environmental miasma or<br>bad air with risk being modulated by<br>host or patient factors like hard work<br>and<br>exercise to put this uh Livingston's<br>writings at the time in context um in<br>1858 the same year that Livingston<br>embarked on his zambesi expedition<br>London was experiencing the so-called<br>great stink uh when human waste<br>contaminating the TS River produced a<br>strong and pervasive fulin<br>smell um epidemics of fever illness like<br>typhoid which is essentially means fever<br>with mental clouding and abdominal<br>symptoms and the diarrheal disease chera<br>uh which were both rif in London at the<br>time were attributed to exposure to<br>noxious air or myasthma uh everyone<br>could smell<br>it this caricature from punch magazine<br>par parodies the polymath Michael<br>Faraday's initially futile efforts to<br>petition the British Parliament to clean<br>up the TS River to prevent fever and<br>diarrheal<br>disease and Crossing to Africa uh more<br>or less uh just a few years later uh<br>this sketch shows Livingston um<br>exploring the zambesi river um a few<br>years after the great stink in London as<br>now as I told you Livingston was well<br>aware of the dangers of<br>idleness um and he's been carried here<br>not because he's lazy um but because<br>he's suffering from one of the mini<br>bouts of the fever that he was to<br>experience in his<br>lifetime and this night he wrote in his<br>diary the mangrove swamps emitted a most<br>offensive smell and gave us the<br>impression that they were most fitly<br>named the hot beds of fever so he<br>understood that um that uh these marshy<br>environments were<br>dangerous of Interest Livingston was an<br>early user of quinine um a chemical<br>extracted from the Peruvian sinona tree<br>and here are some quinine containing<br>chill and fever tonic labels from the<br>19th century um they again illustrate<br>how closely swamps and Marshy<br>environments were associated with fever<br>and of course today quinine and higher<br>concentrations is known as an effective<br>antimalarial drug and persists as an<br>ingredient in tonic water indeed the<br>potion on the left also contained 10%<br>alcohol so it was not too far from what<br>I'm not sure if you've thought about it<br>um but the word malaria is actually<br>deeply rooted in the mosmatic theory of<br>disease um and and the word dates from<br>approximately 1740 from the Italian Mala<br>for bad and ARA for<br>air thus malaria became the term for<br>fever caused by foul air from marshy<br>districts however this view of causation<br>of fever began to change quickly during<br>the 19th Century as the idea that<br>contagious seed-like entities uh were<br>responsible for the transmission of<br>infection um and this gained uh<br>increasingly widening acceptance the<br>disease um in 1880 the parasites that<br>caused malaria were discovered by sh<br>laran shown<br>here um and in<br>1897 um mosquitoes were identified as<br>the vector of malaria um by Sir Ronald<br>Ross um showing on your<br>right each one a Nobel Prize in<br>physiology or medicine for their work<br>and such discoveries repeated for many<br>infectious diseases and these<br>discoveries underpin our current<br>understanding of causation of<br>infection so um whereas Livingston saw<br>fever as a single disease caused by<br>environmental and host<br>factors um the current Western view of<br>fever looks something like this we now<br>understand that fever um is one of<br>several signs of a disease state that we<br>call infection we understand that<br>infections are caused by germs or<br>pathogens that infect hosts and that may<br>interact with the<br>environment to continue with the malaria<br>story um the infection malaria is caused<br>chiefly by a parasitic pathogen called<br>plasmodium falum transmitted by<br>transmitted by anene mosquitoes that<br>breed in masy environments uh in the<br>tropics<br>hosts or patients who lack immunity from<br>past exposure are susceptible to disease<br>developing a range of symptoms and signs<br>of malaria um including but not limited<br>to<br>fever so um although it's interesting<br>that although Livingston didn't know<br>that malaria was caused by a parasitic<br>uh germ that was transmitted by<br>mosquitoes he quite correctly believed<br>that exposure to Mary environments in<br>the tropics increased risk for disease<br>think so um among Livingston's broad<br>legacies which I'm not going to go into<br>in detail um included the opening of<br>central Africa to a range of Western<br>Colonial<br>influences among these were<br>International Trade um Western education<br>Healthcare the history of Western<br>medicine in Africa that followed is<br>often divided into Colonial and post<br>Colonial periods um during the colonial<br>period the focus was primarily on the<br>health of European expatriates living in<br>the tropics it was during this period<br>that the discipline of tropical medicine<br>really got its start with fever as its<br>most fundamental<br>problem um in parallel with the Scramble<br>for Africa there was a so-called<br>Scramble for African diseases during<br>which time a number of so-called Great<br>Men of tropical medicine uh widely C uh<br>were widely celebrated for discoveries<br>fundamental to our current understanding<br>infectious<br>diseases over time tropical medicine<br>expanded at scope um uh to the health of<br>indigenous peoples um diseases<br>preventing and uh development needed to<br>be understood and controlled to grow to<br>grow productivity in the burgeoning<br>colonies so in a way it's a discipline<br>with a somewhat selfish um<br>origin um moving to the postcolonial<br>period um development included efforts<br>to extend Primary Health Care Services<br>Beyond cities and tropical areas to to<br>rural parts of countries adoption of<br>pragmatic so-called syndrome syndromic<br>approaches to patient management um that<br>can be used by healthcare workers with<br>little training uh to evaluate and<br>manage High volumes of<br>patients and uh interestingly a de<br>emphasis of laboratory and pathology<br>services<br>this is a typical um Outpatient Clinic<br>uh waiting area at an African healthc<br>care facility today um patients are many<br>healthcare workers are few and may have<br>quite limited training um and laboratory<br>non-existent in such low resource<br>settings um something called syndrome<br>based clinical management is often used<br>this slide shows the covers of world<br>Health Organization syndrome based<br>management guidelines they're called<br>integrated management of childhood<br>illness and integrated management of<br>Adolescent and adult<br>illness um by following these documents<br>healthcare workers can um triage and<br>classify sick patients into various<br>clinical syndrome categories like fever<br>and find suggestions for appropriate<br>treatments for example a child with<br>cough who has difficulty breathing and<br>is found to have fast breathing would be<br>classified is having pneumonia and the<br>guideline would recommend an antibiotic<br>called amoxicillin for 5<br>days so what are some of the common<br>conditions that Health healthcare<br>workers are faced with in the tropics it<br>turns out that diarrhea cough um and our<br>problems this slide shows the occurrence<br>of diarrhea cough and fever among more<br>than 1 million surveyed children aged<br>less than 5 years and long low and<br>middle inome countries from 1986 um<br>through<br>2012 this analysis was done by my<br>postgraduate student namata Prasad who<br>might be here um and fever shown in red<br>is actually the most common uh symptom<br>being reported for more than a quarter<br>of children over the twoe period that<br>was asked about in the<br>survey as you can see fever often occurs<br>with cough or<br>diarrhea um but in any given twoe period<br>about 7% of children have isolated fever<br>features and this brings us back to the<br>diagnostic challenge uh fever has many<br>causes some are life-threatening and<br>others are self-limiting and most can't<br>be distinguished from one another by<br>taking a history or examining the<br>patient in settings with few healthcare<br>workers large volumes of<br>patient uh large volumes of patients<br>short patient consultations limited<br>laboratory services there's little<br>chance of making an accurate<br>diagnosis so what's causing this<br>patient's fever and how should she be<br>managed in a low resource<br>area well the World Health Organization<br>guidelines for the treatment of malaria<br>from 2006 have this to say the signs and<br>symptoms of malaria are<br>non-specific malaria is clinically<br>diagnosed mostly on the basis of fever<br>or a history of<br>fever this recommendation could be<br>paraphrased as fever in the tri Tropics<br>should be assumed to be malaria and<br>treated as<br>such however we know that the role of<br>malaria um as a cause of fever is<br>actually change considerably um over<br>tropics so progress with malaria control<br>um well could be dated to all kinds of<br>years but I chose 1874 which was the uh<br>year that uh the chemical DDT was<br>synthesized in in<br>1939 um the insecticidal property of DD<br>D was discovered um then in 1934 the<br>drug chloroquin uh was discovered and by<br>1946 it had been established as a safe<br>and effective<br>antimalarial um using these tools in<br>1955 the global effort to eradicate<br>malaria was launched residual<br>insecticides anti-malarial drug<br>treatment and surveillance for malaria<br>were used with the aim of actually<br>eradicating the<br>disease while these efforts were<br>successful in temperate zones and in<br>areas with seasonal malaria eradication<br>was not attempted in much of malaria's<br>Africa however 1998 saw the return of<br>optimism and a scale up of malaria<br>control efforts using more contemporary<br>tools indoor residual insecticide<br>spraying was used but this time<br>accompanied by insecticide treated bed<br>nets something that ch children sleep<br>under at night to protect them from<br>mosquito<br>bites uh newly developed malaria rapid<br>diagnostic tests that don't require<br>sophisticated Laboratories were used to<br>guide treatment uh with more effective<br>antimalarials called aramin based<br>combination<br>Therapies in this time unlike the 1955<br>effort there was considerable focus in<br>subsaharan Africa and with some some<br>um this graph shows estimates of global<br>Malaria deaths by age in geographic<br>region between 1980 and<br>2010 as you can see Malaria deaths are<br>thought to have been declining in all<br>regions in all age groups including in<br>Africa since around<br>2004 in part due to the control efforts<br>that I just<br>described one effect of the malaria<br>decline is that the proportion of<br>patients with fever who actually have<br>malaria has declined markedly over the<br>past<br>decade in addition to this change over<br>time malaria varies considerably in<br>well um this uh heat map shows the<br>proportion of people with malaria in<br>Africa from 2010 from Community surveys<br>that test for the main malaria parasite<br>plasmodium<br>fosa areas in Gray are essentially<br>malaria<br>free areas in red uh the proportion of<br>the population carrying malaria<br>parasites approaches<br>70% uh in in the community whereas<br>parasite rates approach zero in areas in<br>blue the main message here is that the<br>role of malaria as a cause of fever<br>illness is highly heterogeneous and in<br>fact absent or uncommon in large<br>suedes this means that malaria um is a<br>more common cause of fever in some areas<br>of Africa or the tropics than in others<br>so given this context uh what happens if<br>malaria well this slide summarizes the<br>results of a study of severely ill<br>patients hospitalized with fever in<br>Northern Tanzania my long-term<br>collaborator Hugh rabburn and others<br>studied more than 177,000 Hospital<br>admissions in Northern Tanzania of these<br>4 a half thousand met study criteria for<br>severe fever illness and had malaria<br>film result s confirmed at a reference<br>laboratory of these patients about<br>46% uh had uh laboratory tests positive<br>for malaria and the other half were<br>negative for<br>malaria it's notable that 95% of all P<br>patients were treated with intravenous<br>quinine for severe malaria despite more<br>than half having negative malaria<br>films furthermore um of those without<br>malar area only about 2/3 received an<br>antibiotic treatment for common but<br>potentially fatal non-malarial bacterial<br>infections not surprisingly then um<br>patients admitted to hospital with fever<br>and malaria on your left had a better<br>chance of surviving than those admitted<br>with fever due to something other than<br>malaria on your right 7% case fatality<br>ratio versus 12% uh<br>respectively the problem of malaria over<br>diagnosis among patients with fever in<br>subsaharan Africa and the finding of<br>higher case ferality ratios among FBR<br>patients without malaria compared to<br>those with malaria has now been<br>studies so in 2010 the World Health<br>Organization responded to the concern of<br>malaria over diagnosis by changing the<br>guideline for the treatment of<br>malaria who now recommends that<br>antimalarials be prescribed based on the<br>result of a malaria diagnostic test<br>rather than on the basis of the presence<br>of fever alone and to quote this<br>document um prompt parasitological<br>confirmation by microscopy or malaria<br>rapid diagnostic test is recommended in<br>all patients suspected of malaria before<br>treatment is started and treatment<br>solely on the basis of clinical<br>suspicion should only be considered when<br>parasitological diagnosis is not accept<br>ible but this new guideline uh and<br>guidance immediately raised new problems<br>workers what to do with the patient with<br>fever and a negative malaria diagnostic<br>test particularly the patient who's<br>severely<br>ill when tests for malaria were rolled<br>out it was quickly found that in many<br>places the vast majority of patients<br>with fever did not in fact have malaria<br>at all for the few patients with a<br>positive test The Way Forward was clear<br>prescribe an<br>antimalarial but for the vast majority<br>with a negative test for malaria<br>healthcare workers without a laboratory<br>really stuck knowing what to<br>do without a picture of what the major<br>causes of severe illness with fever are<br>it's very difficult to<br>know and this question underlies much of<br>research which I'm not going to spend<br>too much time on but I'll tell you a bit<br>about Okay so this is kilamanjaro<br>Christian Medical Center in Moshi<br>Tanzania uh it's one of tanzania's four<br>consultant referral hospitals so it's uh<br>quite high high up the hospital<br>hierarchy I was privileged to be based<br>here for 10 years and continue to do a<br>lot of work here with Tanzanian<br>collaborators at this<br>institution and that's mount kilamanjaro<br>in the<br>background um we were interested to<br>understand the causes of fever among<br>patients admitted uh to this Hospital in<br>Moshi<br>um you might be wondering what the<br>malaria situation in Tanzania is like um<br>and as with the earlier heat map that<br>showed the whole of Africa uh this map<br>shows the proportion of people with<br>malaria in Tanzania in 2010 uh from<br>Community surveys that test for the main<br>malaria<br>parasite again um areas in Gray are<br>essentially malaria free um in areas in<br>red the proportion of the population<br>carrying malaria parasites approaches<br>70% as you can see in uh Moshi located<br>is located in an area of very low<br>malaria transmission intensity um<br>straddling um areas in Blue and Gray and<br>the gray area of course being Mount<br>kjaro itself which is so high that uh<br>malaria Transmissions<br>unlikely um so we wouldn't expect<br>malaria to be a common cause of fever um<br>here<br>we looked at uh healthcare worker<br>admission clinical diagnosis versus high<br>quality laboratory diagnosis of uh<br>patients with fever admitted to hospital<br>in Northern<br>Tanzania we carefully studied 870<br>Hospital admissions using uh diagnostic<br>Methods at National and international<br>reference<br>Laboratories we found that healthcare<br>workers clinically diagnosed and treated<br>almost 2third of admissions with fever<br>red but<br>um but uh using the best possible<br>laboratory Diagnostics only 1.6% of the<br>patients actually had malaria uh in red<br>on your left right should I<br>say um and about half of the fever<br>patients uh were confirmed to have the<br>infections listed<br>here notably um healthcare workers never<br>considered or diagnosed most of these<br>non-malaria infections and many had not<br>heard of several of<br>them now I'm not going to go into a<br>great detail about these non-malaria<br>infections uh which are fascinating to<br>an infectious disease physician but<br>probably not to many others um but I<br>will say that um many of these have<br>treatments um and a large proportion<br>including brucelosis leptospirosis and<br>fever are transmitted to people from<br>livestock rodents and other<br>animals and these infections also have<br>important impacts on the survival growth<br>and reproductive success of economically<br>Tanzania these so-called zoonotic<br>infections are the subject of some of my<br>ongoing collaborative research in<br>Tanzania um here we see my field team<br>sampling livestock and testing owners<br>for zoonotic infections in a pastoralist<br>community in Northern Tanzania in this<br>case a Mari<br>Community this type of work requires um<br>close collaboration between human and<br>animal health experts um an approach<br>that's often referred to as one<br>Health Okay so we've so far mostly<br>discussed illness due to infections that<br>death um here during the Great stink of<br>185 8 um the allegorical figure of death<br>rose on on the polluted temps River as<br>my asmatic air hangs thickly um and dead<br>by I don't know if you've thought about<br>your final contribution to the health<br>system um but unless you're an organ<br>donor or you donate your body to science<br>your last last effort is likely to be a<br>piece of data called your cause of death<br>or what you died with it's worth noting<br>that most people in the world cannot in<br>fact make this<br>contribution this is because of<br>inadequate vital event registration<br>systems um and lack of the sorts of<br>laboratory and pathology services that<br>allow us to assign cause of death in a<br>country like New<br>Zealand there's a saying in the study of<br>disease in populations that the<br>uncounted count for<br>nothing this sounds very harsh but let<br>me explain what I<br>mean this slide um shows how we use<br>evidence like aggregate data on cause of<br>death to improve health it all starts<br>with measuring what causes illness and<br>death in a country or region to figure<br>out what the big killers<br>are we then seek to understand the risk<br>factors for these major causes of<br>illness and death and where possible<br>design interventions to address these<br>risk<br>factors these may be adopted<br>International policies allocated<br>resources and implemented and we track<br>the success of these interventions by<br>looking at impacts on illness and death<br>and so the cycle<br>continues for example if we find that<br>lung cancer is a common cause of death<br>and that smoking is a major risk factor<br>Tobacco Control interventions can be<br>designed adopted into policies and<br>implemented and then impacts on illness<br>and death evaluated and so the cycle<br>goes<br>on yet the cause of death is not<br>recorded for 2third of the world's<br>population who live in countries that<br>lack reliable systems for issuing<br>medical death<br>certificates and these happen to be the<br>same countries where the majority of<br>premature Global deaths<br>occur including those due to infectious<br>diseases that present with fever as the<br>chief<br>complaint to understand cause of death<br>in such settings um focus studies are<br>done using a method called verbal<br>autopsy here workers assign probable<br>cause of death based on interview of<br>families about the symptom sys of the<br>deceased leading up to the time of their<br>death and you guessed it um the verbal<br>autopsy scheme classifies a death with<br>fever in a malaria endemic country as a<br>malaria<br>death based on what I've told you so far<br>um you'll recognize that the potential<br>for misclassification here is huge if a<br>healthcare worker cannot reliably<br>distinguish malaria from infections<br>other than malaria during life it's<br>unlikely that a village healthcare<br>worker will do better by interviewing<br>family members sometime after their<br>died um and the global Health Community<br>is realizing that many Global deaths<br>attributed to malaria by verbal by the<br>verbal autopsy method are probably not<br>due to malaria at all here's a<br>prestigious magazine called nature<br>verbal autopsy methods questioned<br>controversy flares over malaria<br>mortality levels in<br>India the obvious concern here is that<br>if the uncounted count for nothing then<br>the incorrectly counted Focus attention<br>diseases so perhaps that's a good point<br>to make some closing comments um you<br>might have wondered why should<br>universities or the University of otago<br>specifically be involved in global<br>Health well I hope I've shown you that<br>for people living in low resource areas<br>lack of health information directly<br>fuels um illness and death<br>through partnership universities can<br>coll do collaborative research that's IM<br>has immediate impacts on health and by<br>strategic selection of postgraduate<br>students from low resource areas we can<br>work together to help develop<br>researchers who will answer pressing<br>health research questions in their home<br>countries for universities in wealthier<br>countries um Global health is an<br>activity not owned by a single<br>discipline within or even outside the<br>Health Sciences and I hope that I've<br>shown with the example of both human and<br>animal health experts tackling zoonotic<br>infections uh in Tanzania that Global<br>health is fundamentally a<br>multidisciplinary activity uh where<br>people from a wide range of of specific<br>skill areas are brought together to<br>apply their skills to solve<br>problems and in this day and age when<br>cross-disciplinary workers increasingly<br>expected by funders and sought by<br>institutions the practice of global<br>Health provides an obvious platform for<br>getting people people within and between<br>institutions and indeed between<br>countries to work more closely<br>together I'd like to finish um by<br>returning to the history of fever on a<br>slightly more personal<br>note um this paper is by my name sake<br>and<br>great-grandfather uh Reverend John Crump<br>he was an english-born New Zealand<br>Methodist missionary in New Britain um<br>an island that was then part of German<br>New Guinea shown here<br>although he wasn't a physician he took a<br>great interest in medical matters am<br>among other things he made uh early<br>observations on the indigenous uh<br>surgical practice of trining following<br>skull<br>fracture fortunately um his paper shown<br>here has been cited only six times in<br>113 years since it was published so uh<br>he did not set me an insurmountable<br>academic<br>president um although as you can see he<br>did outdo me when it came to facial<br>here um he worked in the tropics during<br>that golden age of Discovery in tropical<br>medicine uh when the my Asma Theory gave<br>way to germ Theory and fever became at<br>once better understood and yet<br>indefinitely more<br>complex his Diaries describe many<br>episodes of fever attributed to malaria<br>among family members and others and I've<br>often wondered how many were actually<br>malaria and how many were something else<br>we'll never know um but it's striking H<br>if we still know about causes of fever<br>Beyond malaria in the tropics more than<br>attention uh hello my name is Rob McGee<br>and I'm acting head of the Department of<br>preventive and social medicine and it's<br>my very pleasant uh task to say a few<br>words after John's talk and I think the<br>first first thing I'd like to say is um<br>to thank John for what I found a very<br>enjoyable and engaging talk and I think<br>I especially like I'm the sort of person<br>who likes history as a background to to<br>research and I really enjoyed John's<br>setting that historical context to uh<br>the work on fever and how that informed<br>the work you're doing and I think Jo so<br>I don't really want to add anything<br>about that but I think I did want to<br>take up the personal history that you<br>introduced at the very end and because I<br>was fascinated by that that journal and<br>that work um and I thought well six six<br>citations is not very much I should go<br>and find out a little bit more about<br>this so in fact I looked up the Journal<br>of the Royal Institute of anthropology<br>and it has an impact factor currently of<br>one so so if you have six citations and<br>an impact factor of one nowadays the<br>head of the department would be kind of<br>descend upon you to try and work out how<br>you might increase your productivity and<br>your research quality but in fact if you<br>can actually find the paper which I went<br>and found and it's it's fascinating if<br>you look at the people who are<br>publishing in that journal at the time<br>um and the fellows of the Royal<br>Institute they included the names that<br>stood out to me were Francis gton who's<br>an anthropologist who also is the<br>founder of psychometric theory um James<br>Fraser who I studied many years ago in<br>anthrop in sociology sorry who was the<br>founder of comparative study of<br>religions and William Rivers who was<br>also uh studied kin ship relations in<br>torus straight and uh uh also did work<br>on um treatment of um uh shellshock and<br>um subject of uh various documentaries<br>and books so I think actually that<br>that's pretty good company for someone<br>to be publishing in so I think um you<br>probably want to be too not too hard on<br>the quality of that<br>publication um and it does also suggest<br>that maybe just citations and impact<br>factors don't quite capture the quality<br>of our work<br>sometimes um but the other thing I would<br>like to say is John recently uh was<br>awarded a a prize from the denan school<br>of medicine for the quality of one of<br>his Publications which was terrific too<br>and I think finally the the last thing<br>I'd like to say is just um to thank John<br>uh for his contribution to our<br>department through his terrific work</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
