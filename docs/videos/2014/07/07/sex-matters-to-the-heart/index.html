chancellor<br>for research at enterprise at the<br>university of otago and it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you here to a<br>celebration of one of our new professors<br>professor allison heather who's going to<br>give her an inaugural professorial<br>lecture tonight it's great pleasure at<br>these occasions to welcome members of<br>the university and members of the<br>general public to share with us<br>the um the experience and the research<br>and the story of what have uh has come<br>to<br>lead professor heather<br>to be a member of our academic staff and<br>to join the ranks of our of our leading<br>professors attaining the position of<br>professor at the university of otago as<br>no mean feat and we'd like to celebrate<br>this and share that<br>share that<br>with a wide community both within and<br>outside the university<br>it is a very high honour and we do<br>expect extremely high standards here at<br>the university of otago that<br>achieving at the highest level in all<br>aspects of the role as expected in<br>teaching in research and in service and<br>both those that we promote from within<br>and both and those that we appoint from<br>outside are expected to have those<br>qualities when they<br>come to us and maintain and retain those<br>qualities through their through their<br>career with us<br>we are also<br>like to pride ourselves on being a very<br>family-friendly university that<br>encouraged people to have a very strong<br>work-life balance so we've<br>regan<br>professor heather's daughter here<br>tonight and other members of her family<br>and community who might be joining us in<br>person or through the broadcast of this<br>and also<br>i will highlight too and i'm sure others<br>will do that<br>alison is a very special person in<br>undertaking a lot of<br>high level activity outside of her role<br>she's a very accomplished sports woman<br>who achieves at a high level in a lot of<br>multi-sport activities and i'm sure that<br>will be highlighted by others<br>just in terms of the ceremonials here we<br>have a very interesting structure at the<br>university very hierarchical and<br>traditional in some ways and here that<br>hierarchy has represented all levels at<br>the university level at the divisional<br>level we'll have our pro vice chancellor<br>in the division of health sciences<br>talking<br>that divisional structure has schools<br>and departments we have the<br>dean of the otago school of medical<br>sciences in which the department of<br>physiology sits and also the head of<br>department in the department of<br>physiology who will talk to you so we'll<br>have<br>a little bit of theater in presenting<br>and introducing the speaking to you the<br>speaker will speak and then we'll we'll<br>do the summaries and wrap-ups before we<br>invite you for some refreshments in our<br>staff club so with with that i will hand<br>over<br>for the next phase of this to professor<br>um pat associate professor pat craig the<br>acting dean in the otago school of<br>medical sciences to introduce the<br>speaker<br>well it's a great pleasure to be able to<br>introduce alison as richard has said<br>she's new to the university and so this<br>is an ideal opportunity for you to to<br>meet her<br>many times our professors are promoted<br>from within and so they're already known<br>so<br>alison's new<br>to the university new to you and this is<br>and doing this so early because she only<br>arrived in january is an ideal<br>opportunity for everyone to find out who<br>she is and what she does<br>so my role is to give you a little bit<br>of background<br>about what she's done on her journey to<br>becoming a professor at this prestigious<br>university and she achieved her bsc<br>honours first class at the university of<br>sydney in 1991<br>and she then embarked on a phd in<br>microbiology completing that in 1995<br>and from that phd she achieved at least<br>three publications and it was on<br>bacterial genetics which was her<br>focus in her microbiology phd<br>she was then appointed as a postdoctoral<br>fellow in the department of<br>endocrinology at the royal prince albert<br>hospital<br>in sydney and she held that position<br>between 1996 and 1999 and there she<br>switched her interests from bacterial<br>genetics to diabetes and the kidney<br>complications that are associated with<br>diabetes and i suspect that in her talk<br>she will give you some indication of of<br>why she did that switch<br>and that was a successful postdoctoral<br>fellowship she did a very prestigious<br>book chapter and three publications and<br>that led to her being appointed as the<br>inaugural<br>diabetes and endocrinology research<br>fellow in the department of medicine at<br>the university of sydney and there she<br>initiated her own independent research<br>program studying the influence of sex<br>hormones on the major heart disease<br>atherosclerosis and you can see that<br>from what's up above me that she's<br>staying with the the sex hormones and<br>gender aspects still<br>and in establishing her own independent<br>research program she obviously started<br>off gaining first small grants and she<br>was gaining them from diabetes australia<br>the leo and jenny cancer foundation and<br>that enabled her to move on to larger<br>grants from merck<br>nhmrc and the national heart foundation<br>and that was a very successful research<br>fellow position she gained at least<br>eight publications there<br>to then become the group leader in the<br>heart research institute in newtown<br>and there she switched to sort of high<br>density lipoproteins and their ability<br>to protect against atherosclerosis<br>and she also got into the area of<br>detection of designer drugs in sports<br>doping<br>she held that position up until arriving<br>here<br>and but it overlapped starting in 2009<br>with gaining a senior lecturer position<br>in the school of medicine and molecular<br>bioscience at the university of<br>technology in sydney<br>and she was<br>promoted to associate professor in 2013.<br>so<br>over that period from 2004 onwards<br>the number of her publications rose<br>rapidly and so 31 more publications one<br>more book chapter<br>and gaining larger and larger grants<br>and also a lot of funding from the<br>anti-doping research panel and the world<br>anti-doping agency<br>during the course of all that research<br>she was also supervising a large number<br>of students so since 1999 she supervised<br>14 phd students<br>three masters students eight honours<br>students one postgraduate diploma and<br>has supervised<br>seven research staff ranging from<br>research assistants to postdoctoral<br>fellows and they've obviously been<br>integral to her research program as her<br>success and her publications<br>she's not only been focused on<br>research once she was appointed as a<br>senior lecturer she was then able to<br>teach and she's done a wide range of<br>teaching activities both within the<br>sciences and within the medical courses<br>and she's served on a number of<br>committees such as the executive<br>committee for the honours programme<br>she's acted as the postgraduate student<br>coordinator<br>and so on and so on she's also been<br>interested in biosafety so she's served<br>on a biosafety committee she's also been<br>very interested in her research is on<br>animal models as well as some research<br>on humans and so for a while she was<br>deputy chair of the animal ethics<br>committee<br>and she does quite a lot of research<br>grant reviewing um an editor for the<br>australian<br>atherosclerosis society and has<br>organised a number of conferences<br>so as richard has said<br>gaining an appointment as a professor at<br>this university requires that you come<br>with all the elements of research<br>teaching and service and you don't<br>necessarily put them in that order<br>but allison has shown that she can<br>cover off all those different aspects so<br>it gives me great pleasure to invite<br>alison to talk to us about the research<br>that's<br>dearest to her heart<br>so in my<br>research career i focused on the heart<br>the reason is<br>everyone has one<br>from the moment it starts beating until<br>the moment it stops it works tirelessly<br>and during an average lifetime<br>it will be greater than 2.5 billion<br>so it may surprise you that the actual<br>shape of the heart looks nothing like<br>what is depicted on a valentine's card<br>but instead it's an odd looking<br>structure that would actually fit in the<br>size of your fist<br>and the primary function of the heart is<br>to work as a pump<br>so because it's a pump it has a high lot<br>a high level of muscular tissue and this<br>muscular tissue contracts just like your<br>skeletal muscle to push blood around our<br>body so in overlaying or under the<br>muscle tissue overlays four empty<br>chambers which is what fills with heart<br>and those chambers are broken into the<br>right side of our heart and the left<br>side of our heart<br>so what happens is the blood that comes<br>from our body tissues which is in a<br>deoxygenated state get gets pumped into<br>the right side of our heart<br>and then gets pumped up into the lungs<br>to get re-oxygenated<br>and then once it's reoxygenated it comes<br>back in through the left side of the<br>heart to get pumped into the rest of our<br>body to give the oxygen and the<br>nutrients to all of the different body<br>parts so they can function properly<br>so we've actually got two different<br>pumps operating within the heart the<br>right side and the left side which work<br>together<br>simultaneously<br>so the function of the heart is to take<br>the blood from the heart pump pump the<br>blood from the heart to all of the<br>different organs and body parts of the<br>body supplying them with the oxygens and<br>the nutrients that's required<br>but just like your<br>organs in your body<br>require oxygen and nutrients so too does<br>that muscular<br>tissue that's in your heart<br>and so for that reason we have an<br>intricate coronary artery system that is<br>solely responsible for supplying the<br>blood to the muscle tissue and these are<br>this is uh the system that i work on in<br>so in the clinic we can use a<br>angiogram to actually look at how well<br>the blood is flowing through the<br>coronary heart through the coronary<br>system supplying blood to the heart so<br>here we see beautiful blood flow going<br>extending all the way to the bottom of<br>the ventricles<br>we can actually see the classic example<br>of coronary artery disease which is<br>caused by the disease atherosclerosis<br>and we can see that there's a quite<br>severe blockage in this coronary artery<br>which is stopping the blood from getting<br>to the bottom of the heart<br>once that<br>stenosis or that blockage is fixed up<br>then the blood is now getting to the<br>bottom of the heart and we're seeing the<br>blood flow restored<br>so the disease that's causing this<br>blockage is a disease called<br>atherosclerosis and shown here is an<br>artery that's been taken out of a person<br>postmortem and it shows us exactly what<br>this disease looks like inside our<br>artery<br>so we have<br>this<br>fatty material that gets deposited in<br>our coronary arteries due to the<br>elevated levels of cholesterol in our<br>blood and then overlaying that fatty<br>material is this thin fibrous cat<br>so this lesion itself can go large<br>enough to block the blood flow through a<br>coronary artery or else this thin<br>cap can actually rupture and in<br>rupturing it causes the formation of a<br>clot or a thrombus to form and this<br>thrombus then is what actually blocks<br>the coronary artery and the consequences<br>of this is that a person will have a<br>heart attack called a myocardial<br>infarction<br>or if this uh<br>uh<br>clot forms in the crowded artery this<br>can travel up into the brain and block<br>archery within the brain thereby causing<br>so this disease atherosclerosis or<br>coronary artery disease<br>is the major cause of death in western<br>societies<br>so in the usa<br>coronary artery disease or<br>cardiovascular disease is responsible<br>for 32 percent of all deaths so that's<br>one in three people are dying from from<br>heart disease<br>and heart disease has been the major<br>cause of deaths in the usa every year<br>since the 1900s except for the year 1918<br>when the deaths from war took over from<br>the<br>deaths from coronary heart disease<br>so if you were to work out the<br>statistics for this in the usa coronary<br>heart disease is taking the life of a<br>person every 40 seconds<br>and the reason that i'm so passionate<br>about studying heart disease is<br>statistics tell us if we can eradicate<br>all forms of heart disease from our<br>society our own life expectancies would<br>so i want to put this into perspective<br>for you so heart disease is the number<br>one cause of deaths in our society so if<br>we to add up all of the different<br>cancers put all of the different types<br>of cancers and all the deaths from all<br>of those different cancers<br>we can see that the number of deaths<br>from all of the different cancers added<br>together is actually less than the<br>deaths caused from cardiovascular<br>disease<br>now this is true for men and this has<br>been known for a long time heart disease<br>is a disease for men but we can see here<br>in the data shown in pink<br>indicating for the just the number of<br>deaths in women that heart disease is<br>so no way am i going to belittle that<br>the impact that breast cancer has on<br>women in our society it's a devastating<br>disease and there's no denying that<br>but if we want to put it into<br>perspective of heart disease over recent<br>years<br>breast cancer has caused a death of one<br>in<br>has caused one in 30 deaths whereas<br>coronary heart disease has caused one in<br>seven deaths<br>and just here in new zealand 48 women<br>die from<br>cardiovascular disease every week<br>so the reason that we all know that<br>breast cancer has such a huge impact on<br>women in our societies because of the<br>great fundraising campaign out there the<br>pink caribbean campaign it's only in all<br>our sports we see cycling shirts with<br>the pink ribbon the qriket players the<br>football players are all out there<br>promoting pink ribbon and breast cancer<br>research<br>whereas the campaign for<br>heart disease in women is less out there<br>so all the data that i've shown you thus<br>far is data from the usa so you think<br>okay well here in new zealand or in my<br>home country australia we're safe so i'm<br>just going to show you some local data<br>first of all the all black data which is<br>uh represented representing the new<br>zealand data and we can see that the the<br>actual statistics for new zealand is<br>very similar to what we see for the usa<br>so the usa is the data in blue and in<br>black is the data from new zealand so<br>again we're seeing rates of one in three<br>deaths in new zealand males is due to<br>current is due to heart disease and in<br>females around<br>the 20 rate uh in in the new zealand<br>women<br>for my home country australia we see<br>that the rates are very similar to what<br>we see for the usa and also for new<br>zealand but i want to draw your<br>attention<br>to the stroke rates so the deaths from<br>stroke<br>in females in new zealand and in<br>australia and actually<br>our two nations are doing worse than<br>the usa in terms of keeping women alive<br>after they suffer<br>so for the next few slides i'm just<br>going to show you australian data<br>because we've in australia<br>the latest cardiovascular uh statistics<br>have just been released<br>in 2013 but it's okay for me to show you<br>australian data because new zealand<br>often follows australia as i can show<br>you here in my favorite sport iron man<br>triathlon where we see<br>the craig alexander the australian craig<br>alexander who was world champion at this<br>time he's this is the 2011 ironman<br>melbourne race and he's just in front of<br>the new zealander cameron brown<br>craig alexander went on to win the race<br>and cameron brown was a close second and<br>this is me finishing the race quite a<br>so the first thing i want to tell you is<br>in australia and also in new zealand the<br>news is not all bad so for my entire<br>lifetime the deaths rates from<br>cardiovascular disease have been falling<br>and this is true for both men and for<br>women<br>and one of the major<br>impacts on decreasing the death rates<br>from cardiovascular disease has been a<br>huge amount of research that's gone into<br>improving the surgical interventions<br>that we can now perform as well as the<br>pharmacological agents that we can now<br>use to treat the disease<br>so shown here we can see that over the<br>last uh 10 to 15 years has been an<br>increase in the number of procedures<br>that have been performed in the<br>australian hospitals<br>this is true for males and to some<br>extent for females<br>so one of the procedures that can be<br>routinely formed now is that of a stent<br>placement<br>so here we can see a blockage in the<br>coronary artery<br>and this blockage we what we do is we<br>use a catheter and we we use a catheter<br>to insert what's called a balloon stent<br>in the area which is being blocked<br>and then once it's in the right area<br>we inflate the balloon and this<br>basically forces the stent and the<br>balloon to open<br>and actually open up that blocked<br>coronary artery<br>the balloon is then removed and the<br>stent stays in place and remains as a<br>scaffolding holding open that artery for<br>the other procedure that can be used is<br>that<br>that that is done in the hospitals these<br>days is a coronary artery bypass now<br>this is a little bit more invasive<br>and it is usually done when there's<br>multivessel disease so here we can see<br>the stenosis in a number of the<br>different coronary arteries and<br>basically what the the doctors do the<br>surgeons do is they go in and they<br>replace<br>the blocked arteries with<br>arteries from other parts of your body<br>so they'll take the mammary artery or<br>they'll take some veins out of the body<br>from from another part of your body and<br>they'll use these and basically<br>reconstruct a coronary artery system for<br>you so that blood can get back from your<br>aorta back to the myocardium of your<br>so in conjunction with these with the<br>increase in surgical interventions<br>that's being used we've got an<br>improvement in the pharmacological<br>agents that can now be used to treat<br>patients<br>so we've had a huge increase in the<br>number and also the usage of drugs that<br>are targeted to preventing clots from<br>forming<br>we also have an increase in the drugs<br>that are available to lower our blood<br>pressure<br>and also there's been a huge increase in<br>the use of statins to decrease<br>cholesterol levels so decreasing<br>cholesterol levels is something that has<br>been<br>pushed into the public arena for many<br>years now and not only are we relying on<br>doctors to give us statins and drug<br>treatment but there's also these huge<br>campaigns for us to try and change our<br>lifestyle so that we can lower our<br>cholesterol levels and live healthier<br>lives<br>and one of the best<br>lifestyle campaigns that's out there at<br>the moment is that is the one that's<br>being pushed by the american heart<br>association and it's called life simple<br>seven<br>so in life simple seven they're asking<br>us to go and get active and by getting<br>active<br>they're asking you to do 150 minutes of<br>exercise per week<br>they're telling us to control our<br>cholesterol levels telling us to eat<br>better<br>to manage our blood pressure<br>to lose some weight reduce blood sugar<br>and<br>hopefully to stop smoking<br>but unfortunately why the surgical<br>interventions have improved and our drug<br>therapies have improved<br>as a society we're not doing very well<br>in maintaining this healthy life<br>campaign<br>so once again this is recent data that's<br>come out of the usa and it's actually<br>going through those simple seven and how<br>well the u.s adult population are doing<br>in managing each of these seven steps<br>so if we look at smoking it's actually<br>good where down to 76 percent of people<br>are no longer smoking or 76 percent of<br>people do not smoke<br>but when we look at<br>body mass index<br>we can see here that 66<br>or more<br>are<br>either obese or overweight<br>if we look at physical activity only 40<br>percent of the adult population in the<br>usa are getting adequate physical<br>activity on a weekly basis<br>more than 50 percent have high blood<br>cholesterol levels more than 50 percent<br>have high blood pressure levels and<br>about 40 percent have high fasting blood<br>glucose levels<br>but this is the statistic that's<br>probably most alarming and that is only<br>0.3 percent of the us population that<br>was surveyed are actually maintaining<br>their healthy diet or meeting their<br>criteria to get a good healthy diet<br>score<br>and if you have a look and it's actually<br>close to 80 percent actually completely<br>failed the healthy diet score<br>so what this is doing is actually<br>setting up these adults to begin to get<br>the diseases coronary artery disease<br>atherosclerosis as well as type 2<br>diabetes and that leveling off that we<br>saw in the<br>decrease in cardiovascular rates over my<br>lifetime might start to level up and we<br>might actually start to see a u-turn<br>where adults are getting<br>more coronary artery disease because of<br>this lifestyle<br>impact that the impact that this<br>so this is the adult population so what<br>i'm going to show you now is even more<br>scary and this is the data from the u.s<br>children surveyed at the same time as<br>for the adults<br>so it's good that only that 85 percent<br>but what is not good is that 35<br>so one in three<br>you even over one in three u.s children<br>are either overweight or obese<br>only 36 percent of them are getting<br>adequate physical activity<br>and when we look at this statistic<br>we're seeing<br>that 30 percent of<br>our children like adult children in the<br>usa have high cholesterol levels this is<br>children that we're talking about<br>they 15 have high blood pressure and 15<br>percent have high fasting glucose levels<br>and not one child that was surveyed or<br>not one family that was surveyed<br>met their healthy diet criteria score<br>so this is alarming because these<br>children are looking at getting early<br>life<br>coronary artery disease type 2 diabetes<br>and just in my lifetime of working in a<br>clinic so as<br>professor craig pointed out i began my<br>postdoctoral years in a diabetes clinic<br>and in a diabetes clinic<br>you know 15 years ago it was really rare<br>to see a child with type 2 diabetes and<br>even more rare to see a teenager with<br>the fatty streaks of atherosclerosis now<br>in the clinic this is becoming more and<br>more common where we're diagnosing<br>children and teenagers with type 2<br>diabetes<br>so this is an issue because these<br>children will go on to get early life<br>atherosclerosis<br>so what i try and do is actually um try<br>and get out into the society and into<br>the community and i talk to teenage<br>children and the parents of teenage<br>children or the parents of children i<br>target pnc communities and<br>t<br>p and c committees in schools<br>and try and just talk to them about<br>what it is to maintain a healthy<br>lifestyle balance<br>so what i do is use that my passion for<br>sports and i do ultra marathons and iron<br>man triathlons and i use this to<br>actually get in front of people and say<br>it is actually possible to maintain a<br>healthy lifestyle balance and be<br>successful in a career and and and raise<br>children and do everything and actually<br>if you're healthy it's actually easier<br>for you to be successful at everything<br>that you do<br>so it's been uh pleasing for me that in<br>some instances i've actually been able<br>to encourage high school children and<br>and mothers of high school children to<br>do to participate in local fun runs and<br>often when i'm running now i'll actually<br>see them out running and it's nice to<br>know that i'm having that impact<br>even if it's just a small impact on<br>trying to promote a healthy diet in our<br>so when i go out into the community and<br>talk about lifestyle balance i don't go<br>out there and say okay guys you've got<br>to sign up and do a marathon or you've<br>got to do an iron man<br>triathlon because any crazy people do<br>that i'm told<br>but instead i talk to them about well<br>how much energy dense foods are you<br>putting into your body every day<br>compared to how much activity are you<br>actually participating in<br>and one of the things i'd like to show<br>is this slide<br>so for an average teenager to grab a<br>mars bar and a coke as a snack<br>this is just a common common occurrence<br>but if you were to do that you're<br>actually taking enough energy in your<br>body that you could then go running for<br>an hour and 15 minutes non-stop to burn<br>off all that energy that you've just<br>taken in<br>if instead you were to have a choctaw<br>muffin and a chocolate latte<br>you could actually go running for the<br>next hour and a half to two hours to<br>burn off the energy that you've just<br>taken into your body<br>by comparison if you choose a less<br>energy dense food like your apples or<br>your oranges just something that's a bit<br>more natural walking from lecture to<br>lecture is actually burning off the<br>energy that you've just consumed so this<br>is what i mean by an energy dense food<br>and why is that<br>because if you consume a can of coke<br>you're basically taking in 10 cubes of<br>sugar and if i was to sit here and offer<br>you 10 cubes of sugar most of you would<br>say no way i'm not going to take in 10<br>cubs of sugar but most people would<br>drink a can of coke quite readily you<br>couple that with your mars bar you're<br>then taking in another seven teaspoons<br>of sugar and three teaspoons of fat<br>so putting that all together that's too<br>much energy even for me when i'm in my<br>peak training for an iron man it's too<br>much energy for my body to to to absorb<br>and to consume and so that glucose that<br>i've taken in that sugar i've taken in<br>gets converted into triglyceride and<br>triglyceride then gets stored in your<br>body as fat or your adipose tissue and<br>this is why we're seeing a rise in our<br>obesity rates in children and teenagers<br>is simply because of this over<br>so what we need to happen is that the<br>community to embrace the healthy living<br>healthy living changes and just step by<br>step and at the same time we need more<br>research into heart disease so that we<br>can actually stop the disease from<br>occurring in the first place<br>and so one of the initiatives that i've<br>been involved in in heart disease<br>research over the over<br>15 years or 20 years now is trying to<br>understand the difference in heart<br>disease that presents between men and<br>women<br>so if we look at these statistics so<br>this is just statistics for prevalence<br>of heart disease not not<br>death rates but but prevalence of heart<br>disease we can actually see that men um<br>are more likely to get heart disease and<br>it's more prevalent in men than it is in<br>females especially in these younger<br>years<br>so in a man that's 45 to 54 he's two<br>times more likely to have coronary<br>artery disease than are female however<br>now why men<br>while men are more prone to getting<br>heart disease when females get the<br>disease it's more likely that they'll<br>die from the disease<br>so since 1984 the mortality rates for<br>women have actually been higher than men<br>in the usa<br>so men are more likely to get the<br>disease but when women actually get it<br>it's more likely that they're going to<br>die from it<br>so a lot of research now has gone into<br>trying to understand well why do men get<br>more heart disease in the first place<br>and then why is it more likely that the<br>female will have a myocardial infarction<br>or stroke and die<br>versus<br>a man<br>and one of the<br>key<br>advances in atherosclerosis research is<br>our ability now to image the disease in<br>real time so shown in the background is<br>that image that i showed you previously<br>which is actually an artery that's been<br>taken out post-mortem and we can<br>actually see the disease but now we can<br>actually use<br>specialized cameras that are we are able<br>to insert into the coronary arteries of<br>people while they're still alive and<br>actually look at how much<br>atherosclerosis they have<br>and if we<br>look here this is a an indication of a<br>plaque in a coronary artery and this is<br>the thin fibrous carp the bit that's<br>shining bright yellow is the thin<br>fibrous cap and this dark material here<br>is the<br>lipid core this fatty material that's<br>shown here so we can actually visualize<br>that this is quite a large plaque that's<br>sitting in someone's coronary artery we<br>can see that the lumen should be round<br>like a pipe and instead it's this oval<br>shape because the the<br>lesion is encroaching on the lumen<br>and then in this uh image what we see is<br>that that<br>that thin fibrous park is actually<br>ruptured and we see a breakage in that<br>thin fibrous cap and now what we see is<br>the formation of a thrombus and it's<br>that thrombus that can travel down<br>through that coronary artery network<br>cause a blockage and cause someone to<br>so this is another image just showing<br>you this uh complete rupture of that<br>thin fibrous cap<br>so we've been able to visualize these<br>rupture type of of arthroscopic plaques<br>but then as this research developed what<br>we were able to now show<br>is that atherosclerosis doesn't always<br>present as that classical<br>thin fibrous cap rupture cause a<br>thrombus<br>people have a heart attack but instead<br>there's actually another form of<br>atherosclerosis that's quite prominent<br>in coronary arteries in about 30 percent<br>of cases and what we're seeing here is a<br>much thicker yellow layer<br>so a much thicker fibrous cap and a much<br>smaller lipid core<br>but in these kind of lesions they still<br>go on to form myocardial infarctions and<br>strokes<br>we actually get erosion of that fibrous<br>cap and the formation of smaller clots<br>and so these clots travel down into<br>smaller coronary arteries thereby<br>causing the myocardial infarction or the<br>heart attack or they can travel up into<br>the brain and cause a stroke<br>so when we start to think about gender<br>what we now know<br>is that in women<br>women develop the disease later so men<br>are developing at 45 to 54 whereas women<br>are developing after the 55 and then<br>older and we know that they have<br>now now from these imaging analysis we<br>know that they have um<br>predisposition to get these more erosive<br>plaques rather than these rupture<br>plaques so younger women are more likely<br>to have an erosive plaque whereas a<br>younger man is much more likely to have<br>a ruptured type of plaque<br>and then because of these erosive type<br>of plaques and the smaller clots that<br>form in women and then the smaller<br>coronary arteries that that get blocked<br>it actually uh turns out that they have<br>less obvious symptoms of having a heart<br>attack so women a woman might present at<br>an er suffering a heart attack but<br>because a small the smaller coronary<br>arteries are being blocked it's not<br>actually as painful or as symptomatic as<br>what we see in a in a rupture kind of<br>plaques that a man is more likely to<br>present with who have that obvious heart<br>attack that is depicted in in hollywood<br>movies<br>now because of this different type of<br>disease that seems to be associated with<br>women versus men there's been a<br>hypothesis for a number of years now<br>where our sex hormones are<br>responsible for the for this different<br>so in females our sex hormones are<br>estrogens while in men the sex hormones<br>are angins<br>now it's thought that estrogens because<br>women are developing the disease later<br>that estrogens are actually protecting<br>women against developing earlier life<br>atherosclerosis or coronary heart<br>disease whereas antigens<br>thought the male hormones are thought to<br>be promoting the disease in men which is<br>why they're getting the earlier onset<br>disease<br>so we actually studied this arm in in my<br>laboratory for a number of years<br>and<br>to simplify in just one slide<br>i'm going to show you some data that we<br>got from an animal model<br>so here we've got normal mice these are<br>normal male mice<br>and they develop atherosclerosis and we<br>can see<br>in that circled area we can see a small<br>amount of plaque very very small amount<br>of atherosclerotic plaque<br>in mice that have been modified so that<br>they are no longer able to produce their<br>own testosterone at all so these male<br>mice have no no male antigens we can see<br>that there's much more plaque present in<br>these<br>coronary arteries<br>now if we take these mice that can't<br>produce our own testosterone and then<br>treat them with testosterone so we give<br>them a testosterone implant so their<br>testosterone is restored we actually<br>then reduce the amount of plaque that<br>they're getting<br>so in fact what we was able to show in<br>the laboratory is that male hormones are<br>not driving atherosclerosis in men or<br>coronary artery disease in men and<br>antigens are very unlikely to be the<br>reason that men are getting that earlier<br>onset atherosclerosis<br>and this is backed up by epidemiological<br>data so if we take men<br>across the spectrum and we've got men<br>that have low naturally occurring low<br>testosterone levels and naturally<br>occurring high testosterone levels it's<br>actually the men that have low<br>testosterone levels that have higher<br>levels of coronary artery disease<br>so it seems that low testosterone is<br>associated with heart disease rather<br>than high testosterone promoting heart<br>disease so that whole antigens driving<br>atherosclerosis we were able to shut<br>down that hypothesis<br>so then we turned our attention to the<br>other hypothesis well can a students<br>protect females against heart disease<br>and looking at this epidemiological<br>evidence this is just showing you the<br>same thing i've been showing you that<br>men get heart disease<br>more early or earlier than women do but<br>i've just shown you<br>in a slightly different way so i can<br>point out that as women go through<br>menopause<br>heart disease increases so during<br>menopause a woman's ovaries shut down<br>and they're no longer able to secrete<br>any estrogen they don't they no longer<br>secrete estrogens and their estrogen<br>levels fall dramatically<br>and so it would expect so during this<br>time when estrogen levels have fallen<br>suddenly heart disease takes off so<br>women have lost their estrogen<br>protection<br>so is this what's driving the heart<br>disease in older women but also what's<br>protecting<br>uh the<br>women against heart disease in their<br>earlier life<br>and there's been a huge amount of data<br>to support this estrogen protection<br>hypothesis<br>so estrogens have been shown to reduce<br>inflammation in the heart it evokes good<br>genomic changes in the heart it<br>decreases cellular stress and in animal<br>models it's been shown to decrease<br>atherosclerosis<br>it has a good effect on ischemic disease<br>and it protects against heart failure so<br>there's a lot of evidence to suggest<br>that estrogens in younger women are<br>protecting against heart disease<br>so then it was thought great if<br>estrogens are going to protect women<br>against heart disease why don't we treat<br>post-menopausal women so these women<br>that have lost their ability to produce<br>their own estrogens with estrogen<br>replacement therapy so a whole lot of<br>hormone replacement therapy trials were<br>started<br>and to see if estrogen given to women<br>after they've been through menopause and<br>they<br>they've got this<br>rapid onset chronic r2d disease<br>developing will actually slow down the<br>disease in these older women<br>but what was found was actually the<br>opposite<br>or<br>actually it was it was quite dramatic so<br>hormone replacement therapy in older<br>women<br>not only in some studies showed no<br>cardiovascular benefit in quite a number<br>of studies it actually promoted<br>cardiovascular events and a lot of these<br>studies were actually stopped<br>prematurely because of the adverse<br>effects of the hormone replacement<br>therapy<br>and so<br>what we<br>did in the laboratory is we had we<br>actually had a look if females already<br>have atherosclerosis and then they give<br>an estradiol on our easter dial null<br>background so they've lost their own<br>ability to produce estrogens and then we<br>give them back estrogens after they've<br>already developed coronary artery<br>disease or atherosclerosis what do their<br>plaques look like and what we found was<br>that in the<br>females that were treated with estradiol<br>we're actually seeing this dramatic<br>increase in the calcification of that<br>atherosclerotic plaque<br>so atherosclerotic plaque has an<br>important clinical consequence it<br>hardens the artery it hardens the plaque<br>and so it's much more likely to rupture<br>and cause a clot and that's exactly what<br>the the the<br>people that was running these uh hormone<br>replacement trials were seeing that<br>these women were getting more clots and<br>having more strokes and having more<br>myocardial infarctions so the data that<br>we're able to show in the laboratory<br>backed up what they're actually<br>and so now what is known is that women<br>have this high mortality rate<br>but men are getting the disease 10 years<br>earlier<br>we know that women tend to have more<br>erosive plaques versus the rupture type<br>of plaques that we see in men<br>and because of that women tend to<br>present with different heart attacks<br>there's<br>different heart attack symptoms but also<br>we also now now know that hormone<br>replacement therapy is not really a<br>valid option for treating older women<br>against heart disease<br>in men they have the classical heart<br>attack symptoms but moreover a lot of<br>the<br>the surgical interventions and the drugs<br>that we now have for treating heart<br>disease are working very effectively for<br>men because we're seeing that decrease<br>in mortality rate<br>so we still have this question of why<br>men are getting the heart disease<br>earlier and is it because it's<br>protecting<br>estrogens and protecting the females and<br>that's probably a very likely scenario<br>but then once the females get the heart<br>disease we still don't understand why<br>there's such a high mortality rate<br>and one of the reasons for this is<br>really there's been a lack of research<br>in the last 20 years<br>on women's specific disease where only<br>in the last 10 or so years has it become<br>really obvious that when the disease in<br>women looks and and<br>appears to be different to what it is in<br>men and if we look at all of the studies<br>that have been done in the last 20 years<br>we can see most of the studies have<br>concentrated on on men and the data that<br>they've got in terms of interventions in<br>terms of surgical interventions or drug<br>interventions have all basically<br>used men as their cohort rather than<br>women and there's very few uh<br>there's<br>much less data available for treating<br>the disease in women and that's<br>something that i will be concentrating<br>on here in otago is<br>is working on this balance between the<br>data for men versus the data for women<br>and we'll be studying why women are<br>so i have not got to where i am today<br>without<br>a strong team behind me and this<br>includes my mentors professor david<br>selimer who's a cardiologist at<br>the first hospital that i worked at the<br>royal prince alfred hospital in sydney<br>and he taught me all about hearts<br>professor david hendelsman has been<br>responsible for teaching me all about<br>sex hormones and then professors john<br>turtle and phil barter vilbarda was the<br>director of the heart research institute<br>my entire time that i was there<br>they've both been instrumental in having<br>a positive influence on my career<br>to my phd supervisor tom frenchy<br>although i left the the field of<br>microbiology and became<br>very interested in diabetes and one of<br>the reasons for that is that during my<br>first pregnancy i got gestational<br>diabetes and so it became a human factor<br>for me so i wanted to study it and that<br>was really the major reason<br>for my shift from microbiology to<br>no person can stand up here as a<br>professor and not be thankful for all of<br>the people that have actually worked in<br>the laboratory<br>i've had a number of talented postdocs<br>go through my laboratory over the years<br>but a special thanks has to go to dr<br>christine mcgrath who has been a<br>foundation in my laboratory for 15 years<br>and it was really pleasing that when i<br>made the decision to take up the<br>appointment here at the university of<br>otago they've since made her an<br>appointment to<br>promote her to a lecturing position from<br>a vice chancellor's fellow to a<br>lecturing position giving her now the<br>opportunity to embark on her own<br>independent science career and i think<br>it's really nice that people that we<br>train go on to have their own<br>independent careers down the track<br>i've had a lot of students go through<br>the laboratory there's too many to<br>mention<br>but all have contributed<br>to to the research output in my lab<br>and i think while being a scientist and<br>working laboratory is very hard work we<br>also have a lot of fun so i have<br>postdocs come from china as shown here<br>and i actually grew up in the south<br>coast of new south wales in farm country<br>so it's really nice to be able to take<br>these people back to where i grew up and<br>and show them around<br>we go to international conferences and<br>present our work<br>we have graduations go through the<br>laboratory and we've also had a number<br>of awards and we've also had a number of<br>babies born in the laboratory and i'm<br>proud to say that i'm the godmother to<br>two of the children that have um<br>that have been born in the in the lab<br>so being successful at science and<br>forging a university career takes a lot<br>of time and dedication<br>so i'm very fortunate that in my journey<br>i<br>have been supported by my two daughters<br>jamie and regan<br>from a very early age these two girls<br>had to learn to be independent because<br>mum wasn't always there to make their<br>lunches or help with their homework or<br>be at soccer or or dancing events<br>so this honor tonight i share with them<br>we as you can see have all grown up<br>together and i hate that what i do<br>inspires them to dream big and to follow<br>their own ambitions in whatever they<br>decide to do<br>so my oldest daughter is now 19 and my<br>younger daughter is here tonight i'm 13.<br>thank you alison for the<br>presentation i'm brian hyland the head<br>of department of physiology and my job<br>is to do the vote of thanks for the<br>for allison's talk<br>so clearly we've come a long way since<br>the greeks believed that the heart was<br>the seat of the will<br>and the soul<br>and that the brain was just an organ for<br>dissipating excess heat<br>but<br>and and clearly of course now we have a<br>different understanding but the heart is<br>still the heart and without the heart<br>nothing else works which i think alison<br>has done a very good job of illustrating<br>for us tonight<br>now she's also highlighted you know the<br>the horrific statistics of<br>what heart disease is doing to us and<br>while you can argue well you know we all<br>have to die of something<br>the the problem with heart disease is<br>when it strikes people down so<br>it's striking people at a point in their<br>lives when they still have much to give<br>so it's a terrible tragedy of course for<br>the families for the individuals<br>themselves of course<br>but it's also taking away from our<br>society<br>uh people at a stage where they're ready<br>to not only continue contributing to<br>society but to pass down their knowledge<br>and their experience to<br>um to the younger generations so the<br>numbers the finance special implications<br>to the country are a terrific impact and<br>i think allison's done a a wonderful job<br>of highlighting that importance<br>and although she showed graphs that<br>indicated that the rates were dropping<br>it's been worse in the past it's been<br>worse in the past but it's still a<br>terrible problem for us<br>and i think another thing that allison<br>did a great job of of highlighting was<br>the need two things really the need for<br>basic research<br>sometimes in animal models that enables<br>us to address<br>key functional mechanistic questions<br>that then translate through into the<br>clinic and improve the treatment that we<br>can provide to patients and i think the<br>final thing and reflected in the title<br>of her presentation<br>was the<br>the scandalous lack<br>of studies across the genders for this<br>particular disorder and it's not just<br>heart disease i have to say it's a<br>widespread problem that we are<br>so<br>badly lacking in data about one half<br>of the human population so we're looking<br>forward very much to to having allison<br>pursue that research here and and push<br>that that frontier forward uh in her<br>time at otago<br>now it's traditional uh in this<br>my role also is to is to pass on a token<br>of our appreciation to allison for her<br>presentation but as it was pointed out<br>by um pat<br>earlier you know alison has only just<br>joined us so it's also my chance really<br>to personally welcome her not only to<br>the professoriate which is the main role<br>of this<br>of this event but also to the department<br>and to the university and to wish her<br>all the best for a very<br>fruitful and enjoyable future with us<br>here at otago so i just like to make a<br>small presentation i have to put the<br>microphone down because i don't have so<br>many hands and then i'll pass on to the<br>pro vice chancellor<br>the health sciences<br>campton to finish off proceedings so<br>alison we have two things here for you<br>something to remember the presentation<br>by and something perhaps to offer some<br>intellectual stimulation from our local<br>university bookshop<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
