I do a BA in english literature <br>and a minor in sociology as well.<br>I found getting together the finances for Uni quite difficult but I managed to get a Maori and Pacific Island<br>entrance scholarship and that enabled me to go and stay in a hall<br>and live the usual first year experience which was awesome.<br>My favorite subjects were English and  Drama.<br>I just love them. They kind of go well<br>together.<br>English develops your critical reading skills which is important<br>if you're reading a case and it allows you to maintain some amount<br>of creativity which it's easy to lose that and more but it's the way<br>you can write a really really good paper.  If you're open minded and<br>think of creative ways to approach a problem.<br>English kind of helped me<br>do that as well. I was really interested<br>in the logic behind the law and also the role it plays in<br>human relationships.<br>I find the law challenging and intricate and it's something that I can see myself working in for a long time<br>especially, potentially family law so<br>I'm going to try and get a summer job this summer<br>so I can kind of have a real experience and compare that to my last summer working in english<br>and try and make an educated decision on where I go after this.<br>When you're an Otago student you kind of from an affection towards the University and the students.<br>It's so collegial and enjoyable<br>which makes it a whole lot easier because it is a challenging degree<br>but people make it a whole lot easier</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
