let<br>hangout today brought to you by the<br>University of wadoo um I'm very excited<br>today because we're talking all about<br>Antarctica and we have um two very<br>special guests Dr Charles Lee and Jemma<br>Collins who have both recently returned<br>from doing research in one of the most<br>extreme places on Earth uh in Antarctica<br>so they are from the University of wado<br>and ikar which stands for the<br>International Center of terrestrial<br>Antarctic research and they're going to<br>be asking us answering all of your<br>questions today from how they got<br>started what they studied at Uni what<br>their work involves how they deal with<br>the cold and pretty much anything else<br>you want to find out about research on<br>the ice so if you're watching on YouTube<br>or on Twitter on Facebook ask us<br>questions in the comments or you can<br>tweet to us on antar Antarctica hangout<br>the hasag so I'll let Gem and Charles<br>tell you a little bit more about their<br>work but um basically Gemma is looking<br>at tiny arthropods called springtails<br>that live in Antarctica and um she's<br>using them to find out a bit more about<br>how animals will adapt to changing<br>climates and Charles is studying<br>microbes in some of the most extreme<br>Place places on Earth uh including<br>anartica dry valleys and deep sea<br>hydrothermal vents thank you both for<br>joining us<br>today oh thank you no worries so to<br>begin with uh tell us a little bit about<br>your work we'll start with you child<br>Charles um what do you mainly work on<br>when you're an Antarctica I know it<br>changes a lot depending on the project<br>but what's your main<br>focus well our main focus is to<br>understand how the ecosystem of the<br>Antarctic drive valys work and um it's a<br>very unusual ecosystem in that it's<br>essentially a cold desert but there are<br>no plants and there are all there are no<br>animals larger than what JMA works on<br>which is a springtail an other pot uh<br>and this means that basically all the<br>all the life that is in The drrive<br>Valleys is microbial and uh a very<br>intimate connection between these<br>microbes and the environment<br>itself and that gives us a very unique<br>opportunity to understand how life is<br>shaped by these um physical and chemical<br>forces which we can simply cannot do in<br>any other environment because in any<br>other environment um trees would<br>influence all the biology around it um<br>animals influence the biology underneath<br>them whereas in Antarctica it gives us a<br>very unique window into how the physical<br>and chemical properties of the<br>environment affect<br>microorganisms absolutely that's<br>fascinating um and and Gemma tell us a<br>bit about your work with<br>springtails yeah so if you have a look<br>at the Antarctic landscape it looks<br>quite be and as Charles was uh just<br>saying that uh there's no trees and you<br>have to look quite closely before you<br>can see anything you can't see the<br>microbes but uh what I'm working on is<br>the springtails they're about 1 mm in<br>length so they're pretty small but you<br>can see them and they're found on the<br>underside of uh rocks and stones that<br>are quite close to water and um there's<br>not much water there it's quite a dry<br>environment a very dry environment so uh<br>the areas that I study are um only only<br>small spaces so um this year we were in<br>the Taylor Valley and next to a pond so<br>I was able to go as well and um uh I'm<br>looking at the genetics of these<br>springtails and how the genetic<br>diversity might be impacted by uh<br>climate change and uh if the years<br>continue to uh warm and the air<br>temperatures continue to increase how<br>might that affect the genetic diversity<br>of these animals which are you know key<br>players and the antartic systems that's<br>really really interesting and you know<br>tell me a little bit about the spring<br>Tales because they obviously as you said<br>it looks like quite a Barren environment<br>are they little tiny spiders being<br>arthropods you know what what do they<br>look like and how big are they yeah<br>absolutely no one really um you don't<br>really know what they look like until<br>you see them I guess but um they they<br>kind of look like miniature ants even<br>though they're not ants and they're not<br>animals um so they're in the phm arop<br>which u means they have an exoskeleton<br>they have segmented body and jointed<br>legs and uh they're quite cute I think<br>they're cute um they're not they're not<br>poisonous you know everyone every time<br>we have animals in the southern<br>hemisphere you know near Australia in<br>New Zealand everyone assumes they're<br>deadly no they're not deadly they're<br>quite cute and<br>vulnerable awesome well we've had a few<br>questions on Facebook already um so Liam<br>who has just finished high school is<br>wondering what you guys studied at Uni<br>and how you got your first research job<br>in Antarctica it's obviously a field a<br>lot of students would love to get into<br>but aren't quite sure how how to go<br>about it so how did you guys get your<br>starts well you could do what JMA is<br>doing which is to do research as a<br>student in Antarctica well that gets you<br>a spot in Antarctica um for me I studied<br>biology in undergraduate and I'm sure<br>GMA did the same um and it I I didn't do<br>work until I was until I finished my PhD<br>and essentially what had happened was<br>that I was um encouraged to apply for a<br>a fellowship and I looked around and um<br>the topic of anartica was um suggested<br>to me and so I wrote a proposal saying<br>that well I'll do three years of<br>research uh research in anartica as a<br>research as a as a postdoctoral fellow<br>and I I got funded so I started doing<br>antartic work and I just stayed down<br>there I guess<br>fantastic and and how about you Gemma so<br>what did you study before you was doing<br>your research that you're on<br>now um so when I was at school I never<br>did any biology courses but I decided<br>when I came to yiddo I was going to do<br>biology it's what I enjoyed the most in<br>my first year here so in my second and<br>third years um I did all the biology<br>courses and then I was fortunate to have<br>uh two of the summer research<br>scholarships that they offer here so um<br>there's a three-month period over summer<br>where there's no uh classes so that's a<br>good opportunity to get a little bit of<br>experience working in the labs here and<br>um those projects I was working on<br>Arctic springtails uh I didn't go to the<br>Arctic but there was uh samples that<br>were already in the fridge that I was<br>able to work on um and then I was<br>fortunate to just carry the project into<br>my master degree and um yeah I was able<br>to go down just in the summer gone and<br>col examples that I'm going to process<br>for my masters yeah fantastic and um<br>Charles we've had someone ask how<br>microbes and microbes you're studying<br>can live in such extreme conditions<br>obviously it it's quite really really<br>dry and um extremely cold down in the<br>dry valleys and also near the um<br>hydrothermal SE vents how do mic how do<br>microbes survive what have they evolved<br>that lets them live<br>there well um the environment extreme is<br>Extreme from our perspective but to<br>Michael organisms who are extremely<br>metabolically um flex flexible it's not<br>particularly extreme they just they<br>adapt to the environment now I'm not<br>saying that any any bug that you pick up<br>is going to have that versatility but<br>bacteria as a life form is very adaptive<br>and over time because we this this<br>didn't happen overnight if if if the if<br>Antarctica went from a tropical forest<br>to um what it is now overnight nothing<br>would survive but of course Antarctica<br>was last a tropical forest about 30<br>million years ago and since then there's<br>been um you know the growth of the ice G<br>and the shrinking the growth and the<br>regrowth and so on so the microbs in<br>that environment have had a long time to<br>adapt to those particular conditions so<br>to them it's not particularly extreme<br>now of course they they would have um<br>special adaptations that allow them to<br>survive um the the temperature fluctu<br>and the lack of light and the lack of<br>moisture but those are in part what<br>we're interested in um but but mostly I<br>think it's because going back to the<br>lack of um more complex organisms and<br>that's what makes the the Antarctic Dy<br>valy is such a unique environment for<br>studying<br>microbiology so I suppose if there had<br>been such a big diverse range of trees<br>and plants and other animals maybe they<br>wouldn't have survived in this in this<br>kind of environment<br>it it all depends on the U the time<br>scale again if if if there's if<br>sufficient time is allowed for evolution<br>to take place then things will survive<br>but if it's a catastrophic event uh so<br>let's say if a volcano erupted and<br>covered everything that's a very drastic<br>event and and EV it doesn't evolutionary<br>uh Evolution doesn't work on that time<br>scale but in terms of what happened in<br>Antarctica over the past 30 million<br>years that the shift was gentle enough<br>and gradual enough that people I mean<br>that life had the opportunity to<br>adapt yeah absolutely and a question for<br>both of you um Andrew's asked is it<br>still very dangerous to work in<br>Antarctica you know you hear about<br>researchers getting frostbite people<br>getting lost in the snow losing their<br>fingers and toes um has technology<br>gotten rid of all those risks or is it<br>still quite a dangerous job being down<br>there they do issue with issue us with<br>um a lot of the safety equipment that we<br>need and a lot of jackets and jerseys<br>they they don't just send you out there<br>with a like be grills kit or<br>anything I got like five pairs of gloves<br>that were all different in some way or<br>something so they definitely K you out<br>before you go I think there's different<br>degrees of danger in working in<br>Antarctica um where we work um it's not<br>particularly dangerous uh because the<br>the temperature is not that extreme and<br>as long as you act sensibly you you<br>probably are well out of Harm's Way uh<br>on the other hand um there are areas<br>where and situations where you may find<br>it quite hazardous um so for example on<br>arabus um early on in the season you<br>will be looking at minus 40 the whole<br>time and so minus 40 degrees outside um<br>then that severely impacts your ability<br>to move and you know you have to be very<br>um careful every movement and every<br>thing you do um so but by and large I<br>think it's not so much technology that<br>has reduced the danger but um the way we<br>approach the environment is now much<br>more um rounded I think we acknowledge<br>that there there is danger and then we<br>are very well equipped and very well<br>trained to recognize these these<br>dangerous situations and try to avoid<br>them yeah absolutely and relief<br>awareness has asked asked on Twitter uh<br>what is the most dangerous thing you've<br>faced in anarctica so far has it been<br>the cold the animals I guess there<br>aren't many terrifying animals but um in<br>general the animal feces or is it been<br>something else kind of going going a<br>little Stir Crazy being being locked up<br>there over the uh Southern summer what<br>what do you guys think I don't know what<br>what what do you think was the most<br>interesting um I think uh cuz we were<br>walking quite a lot lot when we were<br>down there and um uh it was quite Rocky<br>and unstable ground I think for me the<br>most dangerous thing was trying to look<br>after my ankles that I don't roll them<br>on all the um unstable ground which yeah<br>what's yeah know if you break your ankle<br>you're gonna have a hard time getting<br>out but uh certainly there can be there<br>there are plenty of situations where<br>it's a lot more dangerous um we've had<br>I've had situations where<br>you know we really really worried about<br>breaking through ice and we really<br>really worried about getting stuck in<br>the middle of nowhere with a storm<br>coming in um those are those are real<br>dangers still and I think again it goes<br>back to understanding the environment<br>and trying um mitigate those risks and<br>maybe the other thing is the weather<br>changes really quickly down there too so<br>you have to make sure you're always<br>prepared and you always have an extra<br>jacket and feeding gloves and things and<br>yeah always have the Emergency Equipment<br>that you need and you guys most<br>work down there in summer as you were<br>saying uh what What's the average<br>temperature that you're sort of dealing<br>with I guess in the dry valleys you<br>mentioned up in arabus which is um the<br>biggest mountain in Antarctica it's a<br>lot colder but but in general what's the<br>temperature<br>range well I think in January you you<br>will during the day it is most likely<br>above<br>zero um uh but with with windchill the<br>effective temperature is probably<br>somewhere between -5 to<br>-1 um if you have bad weather as we did<br>uh for a few days during our trip I<br>think it went down to probably minus 15<br>with<br>wicho um and earlier on in the season<br>because for most people the Antarctic<br>summer the research season ends with in<br>early February but it starts in early<br>October so you go in October then you're<br>looking atus 20 air temperature andus 30<br>easily um just a pleasant pleasant chill<br>then no<br>yeah that's pretty full definitely<br>pretty full on I think compared to<br>working in the lab um you know<br>especially in the middle of summer it's<br>quite EXT extreme temperatures um we've<br>also had some questions about the<br>specific skills that you've had to learn<br>um that you think you've learned on top<br>of the science to work in Antarctica<br>car I think for me I was uh fortunate<br>that in my upbringing my dad is quite a<br>keen Outdoors person so I already knew a<br>lot about camping and how to put up<br>tents and sleeping bags and cookers and<br>all that type of thing and I think that<br>if you go to Antarctica to do science<br>then um you're going to be out in the<br>field and you're going to be using that<br>sort of equipment but uh that's not a<br>prerequisite there is two days of<br>training when you arrive so um those<br>kind of skills are not something that is<br>necessary but for me I found that it<br>helped yeah I agree I think um I'm not<br>I'm not big on camping and I think<br>certainly when I first started working<br>in Antarctica there was a a initial<br>shock period that it took me a while to<br>to get over the fact that um we are in<br>the middle of nowhere and um<br>there's there's very little for you to<br>survive on compared with I mean all the<br>you don't have any of the modern um<br>conveniences such as a plumbing system<br>um so I think it initially it will be a<br>shock for a lot of people but again the<br>training that's provided by Antarctica<br>New Zealand I think is very adequate in<br>preparing most people for what they need<br>to do in the field yeah and and that's<br>something interesting actually that I<br>wanted to ask about and a few people on<br>Facebook have been asking as well you<br>obviously um I'm not sure if a lot of<br>people know this but because it's such<br>an environmentally sensitive area and<br>such an untouched continent you sort of<br>have to go in leave no footprint I mean<br>you can't build houses that are L you<br>can't build Plumbing Systems you can't<br>leave any rubbish behind you know what<br>are some of the strangest things that<br>you that you've had to deal with and<br>I've heard the bathroom situation is a<br>little weird if I'm allowed to ask about<br>that well I think you're of course<br>you're allow I think JMA probably can<br>give you a very fresh<br>perspective I'm used to it<br>now it's easier for boys it's always<br>easier<br>uh yes as a female out there it is a<br>little awkward and difficult but it's<br>something that you just get used to and<br>you don't have a choice so it's not it's<br>not really a problem and you just yeah<br>deal with it bottles and buckets are<br>involved yeah and you take out<br>everything including all the biological<br>waste that you is left you know you<br>don't leave anything behind is that<br>right<br>Y which is nice nice on the environment<br>definitely and Diana on Facebook has<br>asked do you also grow your own food<br>while you're there no no I mean it it<br>was commented by somebody on um on<br>Scott's team that Taylor Valley will be<br>great for growing<br>potatoes um but we don't because we'll<br>probably starve um and also it's it's um<br>it's uh unlikely that anything would<br>grow uh given the temperature and the<br>light scheme because even though it's<br>24-hour daylight while we're there um<br>for much of the year there's no sunlight<br>at all so all the food is um is flown<br>into Antarctica uh basically from in New<br>Zealand um and I think that's that's<br>true for uh nearly all the Antarctic<br>bases there or maybe some small<br>hydroponic operations in some bases but<br>that's generally from<br>Theon yeah and and someone else has has<br>asked SOA Griffin um how much food do<br>you need to consume to keep your body<br>weight up you eating a lot more while<br>Antarctica um they have a they have a<br>list of um per person days how much food<br>you need to take so that's all organized<br>but certainly I felt like I was eating a<br>lot more than I normally would and it's<br>quite High uh high fat high high sugar<br>things so it's a lot of salami and<br>cheese and crackers and chocolate and<br>and bacon and hash bounds and things<br>like that so SS great<br>by her description we do eat proper<br>meals in Antarctica we do have frozen<br>vegetables um and um and pasta and rice<br>and so on um I think depends on your<br>workload I think for for people for for<br>what we do which involves quite a bit of<br>hiking um I think we do eat a lot of<br>food because we have to uh when you're<br>out in the cold when you're exposed to<br>the element even though it's not that<br>cold but if you're exposed for 10 hours<br>at a time it it does it does drain your<br>energy and so we we need to replenish<br>that um but there's also plenty of um<br>periods during our our time in the field<br>where we were just sitting in the tent<br>ironically I think most people actually<br>ate more while they were in the tent<br>because they the food is just nearby and<br>they eat more but generally speaking um<br>there is more than enough food supply to<br>keep our energy up and I suppose that's<br>just the good planning that goes into it<br>in advance what is what is the base like<br>do you sleep intense do you is there a a<br>main room that you go to eat in what's<br>the sort of setup that you<br>have um it's Scot base or when we're out<br>in the field um I I guess both so Scot<br>base is obviously a larger base but out<br>in the field what's the setup like so<br>out in the field uh we have tents that<br>look like sort of your ordinary tent<br>that you would use when you go camping<br>and they sleep um well we normally have<br>two people per tent and then there's a<br>that's just where we sleep and keep all<br>our and then there's the main tent which<br>is um much larger and the idea is that<br>everyone can fit in there at the same<br>time to have dinner and that sort of<br>thing and uh this year yeah we had the<br>lab like a lab space in the back with um<br>all the science equipment that we use<br>and microscopes and cuses and things<br>like that and then we also had an area<br>at the front where we had all the seats<br>and um a a heater that was running for<br>the entire three weeks of diesel and um<br>yeah snacks and hot drinks and things<br>like that<br>and Scott base is obviously a lot more<br>established they have real buildings<br>there don't they yeah Scott base is<br>basically it's it's a it's a giant<br>summer camp um you live you you you live<br>in bunk rooms and uh everything all the<br>food is prepared for you just show up<br>and eat um it's it's very easy uh in the<br>field you do have to prep you know worry<br>about your food and um and things like<br>that so we're a re reasonably large camp<br>but we were not there for very long<br>which is why we were essentially um<br>self-sufficient and very uh<br>comparatively we we don't put in any<br>Perman semi-permanent structures um<br>there are events where um they have to<br>stay out there for three three four<br>years not continuously but they just go<br>back every summer and in that case they<br>would set up uh more permanent<br>structures called erect tend and those<br>are properly Big T and you can um you<br>can you can set up complet know living<br>quarters and uh bench space uh canteen<br>all that so yeah and at the small end<br>plenty of events and this is what we<br>used to do is that we we simply go out<br>there with a Scot poer tent and a couple<br>of um Alpine tents and that's it you<br>know you don't you don't have anything<br>you don't have a tent that you can stand<br>up in so we're sort of somewhere between<br>that and a proper um per Camp such a<br>cool experience I can imagine very<br>different um and we've had Owen ask what<br>your opinions are of tourists in<br>Antarctica and Antarctic tourism in<br>general do you believe that the<br>continent should sort of remain<br>protected for scientists only um or are<br>there any measures that you think need<br>to be taken um in addition to what's<br>already going on with<br>tourists well I think that um scientists<br>would I mean we try our best not to make<br>any imprint but there are you know a<br>number of scientists down there and I<br>think it would be a shame if if tourists<br>were to go there as well and you know<br>double the amount of impact we're having<br>so I think that it still is important<br>that we try and reduce that as much as<br>we can but because where where you're<br>going now there aren't any tourists in<br>the dry valleys are there there are a<br>few designated zones where um cruise<br>ships equipped with helicopters can<br>basically take people in to have a luck<br>I think it's a it's a delicate situation<br>because the best way to preserve an<br>environment or preserve a species is<br>raise awareness about it and it's really<br>hard to raise awareness without letting<br>people bear so it's<br>um and right now I think a lot of<br>tourists most tourists they come on<br>boats and they remain ship pound for<br>most of the time and uh primarily when<br>they when they visit when they go on<br>land they visit the uh research bases<br>which probably is more interesting to<br>most people than um than just seeing a<br>cold desert um but there is going to be<br>going forward moving forward I think<br>there will be increasing pressure to<br>allow more tourists to visit different<br>parts of the drrive valleys and that's<br>something that we are working on right<br>now is to understand you know which<br>parts of the drrive valleys are more<br>amendable to that type of visitation<br>than which parts of the drive valleys<br>are really fragile and should be um um<br>to have more restriction on access<br>imposed upon them uh I think the the<br>best way to approach this is to is again<br>through um more information and better<br>management absolutely uh we've had a lot<br>of questions on Penguins everyone one of<br>everyone's favorite part about<br>Antarctica well not everyone's but I<br>guess they're quite popular um do you<br>guys get to interact with them much<br>during your work are they are they in<br>the areas that you're working in or are<br>they closer to the<br>coast do you see at all um I saw some<br>from a distance and from the helicopter<br>as well I had a camera that had good<br>zoom on it so I was fortunate for that<br>um yeah penguins by<br>large yeah penguins by in large stay in<br>coastal colonies and we're Al long way<br>from those so we do see Penguins very<br>very occasionally I've seen three um for<br>the in the past few years I've been down<br>there and those are the ones that walked<br>up to me but unfortunately the ones that<br>I see in this manner are not alone for<br>the world because they were very very<br>lost so they would they wouldn't they<br>wouldn't survive more than 24 48 Hours<br>um so it's almost a bad thing if you see<br>them you know they're going the wrong<br>way and you kind of want to send back to<br>the co the<br>thing um just on that subject um outside<br>of Scott base it was surprising for me<br>just how many seals were just hanging<br>out there for the whole time so there's<br>lots and lots of seals everywhere um but<br>you cannot go closer than 10 met but you<br>can still get quite close so that I was<br>gonna say are they friendly or are they<br>a little bit aggressive they don't move<br>they don't not bothers they're grumpy<br>creatures actually penguins are pretty<br>grumpy too yeah really oh that do just<br>ruined everyone's perceptions they look<br>they stin like wouldn't<br>believe damn okay well no one no one's<br>uh gonna be loving the Penguins after<br>this but they are cute still right up<br>close yeah okay that's good at least um<br>Daniel has a fun question which I don't<br>know if uh is quite your scientific area<br>of expertise but hypothetically if um<br>someone was to transport some polar<br>bears to Antarctica could they wipe out<br>the penguin population there that's a<br>really good question I had I asked of me<br>a few days<br>ago I think they would<br>do<br>okay um<br>because actually Penguins wouldn't be<br>their primary source of food I think<br>seals probably be their primary source<br>of food<br>um they may struggle with um with<br>finding access to ice because sea ice<br>doesn't break out in Antarctica until<br>very very late in the season now what<br>polar bears need is sort of the<br>um CI that's partially broken out but<br>big enough for them to stand on and<br>Float on um<br>I don't know about I don't know if<br>Antarctica would support that kind of um<br>lifestyle absolutely no that's a very<br>very good answer um and Kayla has asked<br>Gemma what is your favorite part about<br>being in Antarctica when you're down<br>there I think my favorite part would<br>have been just how special I felt to be<br>there and how amazing the landscape was<br>I just wanted to take photos all the<br>time everything was really picturesque<br>and everybody who's down there really<br>has worked hard to get there and so<br>everyone appreciates everything and it<br>makes it a really nice experience<br>absolutely and how about you Charles<br>what's your favorite<br>pattern um at this point I would say<br>seeing what we had spent months planning<br>coming into action and walk working as<br>expected rather than blowing up um you<br>know because I think from from my<br>perspective somebody who's been who's as<br>a senior scientist I think it's it is<br>there's a lot of responsibility to make<br>sure that things go smoothly and make<br>sure that Gemma gets gets um whatever<br>she wants to done wants to do done and I<br>think it was very satisfying to see all<br>that<br>happen yeah absolutely that sounds<br>wonderful U and we we have a lot of<br>questions about uh potential jobs how<br>people can get work in Antarctica what<br>are some of the positions that you guys<br>well not you and particular I suppose<br>but the that researchers look for when<br>hiring people to come and work in<br>Antarctica is it only scientists do they<br>need other professions do they need it<br>people do they need um Human Resources<br>people we also have Marlo who was asking<br>if there are jobs for future forensic<br>Antarctica um I think I was surprised<br>how many Defense Force people were<br>working down there so um in the there<br>are a lot of people in the Army and the<br>Air Force and not so many in the Navy<br>but all the jobs like listening to the<br>radios CU while we're out in the field<br>we have to radio in every day and make<br>sure that we're okay and um driving all<br>the diggers and doing all the rubbish<br>and all that sort of things so there's<br>lots of those types of jobs as well and<br>they need electricians and mechanics and<br>everything just to keep the place<br>running and chefs and cleaners and yeah<br>I would say the most um Universal advice<br>I can give is to be very good at what<br>you do because we need all types of<br>people we need chefs we need um it<br>people not we by mean I mean Antartica<br>New Zealand and we need Carpenters we<br>need rans we need mechanics but the One<br>requirement to be down there is that<br>they have to be really good at their<br>jobs um so whatever you pick try and be<br>good at it and for forensic scientists I<br>suppose there is an opportunity because<br>in a lot of um the preservation work<br>that the Antarctic her Heritage Trust<br>does um I would say that there's scope<br>for a forensic scientist to participate<br>but then again you need to be a good one<br>because there there there are plenty of<br>forensic scientists out there and for<br>you to be picked you need to be<br>good and what kind of I mean do you just<br>need to be studying biology obviously if<br>you are going into science as a<br>researcher are there roles for people<br>who've done maths um it physics<br>chemistry other than bi things other<br>than<br>biology well certainly um ice research<br>and um atmospheric research is a big<br>component of um researching Antarctica<br>so there's plenty of um um working<br>groups within New Zealand that work on I<br>CCE Dynamics ice shelf Dynamics and so<br>on but generally<br>speaking I would say that you need to be<br>in science of some kind to to<br>participate in Antarctic research and as<br>a high school student or as a university<br>student I think it's important that you<br>um not necessarily do any subject<br>because like I said this this the<br>spectrum is very wide you could go you<br>go you could go from biology all the way<br>to um quantum physics but take the basic<br>courses and and really try and do well<br>and then when you graduate and this is<br>generally speaking the first opportunity<br>for somebody to to be engaged in<br>Antarctic research is as a at a<br>postgraduate level and a postgraduate<br>you could look around and say you know<br>I'm I'm really interested in doing this<br>type of work and you could contact<br>researchers who are already active in<br>those areas and uh and see if there's an<br>a scope or an opportunity for you to<br>participate and if you really really are<br>interested there's absolutely nothing<br>wrong at all with talking engaging the<br>um those researchers and say you know I<br>I'm going to University this year I<br>would like to do what you do in the<br>future what do I need to take right now<br>and I think most people will be happy to<br>give you that advice absolutely I think<br>it' be very flattering having having<br>someone want to get involved in what<br>you're working on especially when you<br>guys are both so passionate about your<br>work obviously and I I assume most<br>people down in Antarctica are very<br>passionate about what they<br>do and so tell me we've talked about the<br>best part about working Antarctica<br>what's the strangest experience that you<br>there strange experience I once saw a M<br>AG German gentleman dancing in short<br>skirts that was the most disturbing in<br>the<br>snow well there was a there was a dress<br>party at Scott Bas which is a and this<br>German gentleman was enjoying him<br>himself far too<br>much well at least he wasn't just kind<br>of wandering out of the ice somewhere<br>that would be a little<br>bit how about you<br>Jemma yeah I don't know um I guess is<br>hard hard to say we it's quite a quick<br>turnaround from when we get back from<br>the field from when we go home we have a<br>lot of organizing to do so um I guess<br>yeah when you have a small group of<br>people in a small space for a long<br>period of time out in the field but<br>definitely some interesting yeah but<br>what happens on the ice stays on<br>the like a trip to Vegas I love it um<br>and how do you guys shower when you're<br>out there do you are you able to have<br>baths or showers or do you just sort of<br>and and how long do you stay actually<br>what's a what's a regular trip<br>period um for the showers it's baby<br>wipes all the time baby wipes everywhere<br>um we were out in the field for what two<br>and a half weeks yeah I think maybe two<br>weeks yeah between two and a half and<br>two two weeks how many sorry<br>please I was going to say how many<br>people in your group normally when<br>you're camping out there we had a a very<br>very large camp this year um we started<br>out at 12 it grew to 23 at some point um<br>we didn't find out that was going to be<br>this big until we got to Scott base um<br>but that was a<br>surprise um so this year was was kind of<br>exceptional for us it was a very large<br>event um but typically speaking a field<br>team would be between F uh four to six<br>people absolutely makes it a bit more<br>manageable I suppose um and and someone<br>Frederick has asked uh how do electronic<br>devices work in that extreme cold<br>temperature do you use computers do they<br>work the same way they do here do you<br>need to heat them up do they have a<br>freeze um when we're in the main tent or<br>the laptops and things um they work fine<br>because it's warm because we have the<br>heater on um but in the cold the<br>batteries do die a lot faster so for the<br>cameras um normally with my camera I had<br>it inside my shirt and then Z my jacket<br>on top just to keep it so that it stays<br>full um the other thing is that because<br>it's a dry environment uh something else<br>to consider as all the static so you<br>have to be careful not to touch um the<br>memory cards Etc because it can actually<br>wipe everything off them so that's<br>something you have to be careful that<br>you might not think about yeah no I mean<br>where we were it was I would say in<br>absolute temperature terms it's not much<br>colder than the South Island in the<br>winter in fact it's probably warmer uh<br>certainly warmer than Canada at the same<br>time of the year um<br>so I would say that apart from keeping<br>your uh your batteries warm there's not<br>not well there's also dirt uh because<br>the the environment is very dry and it's<br>very dusty so I've had um a zoom lens on<br>my camera die from getting the getting<br>grit in into the um into the um focus<br>mechanism so I had to had that<br>fixed um but at much toward the<br>temperatures going going back to arabus<br>again um it was we discovered that at<br>minus 40 the screen in your laptop will<br>freeze because the L in LCD stands for<br>liquid and it froze atus<br>40 I had no idea wasn't permanent so<br>just you just have to<br>um let it let it warm up yeah that's<br>that's so cool I mean it's a stuff that<br>I guess every time you go down you find<br>something new that you learn something<br>new that you wouldn't have thought about<br>um not working there and how does the<br>weather I mean we talked a little bit<br>about storms coming in how does how does<br>that affect your research if it's a<br>stormy summer can you not go out in the<br>field very much are you sort of tent<br>bound or can you get your work done<br>still regardless of the<br>weather um in the last few days we had a<br>lot of snow well not a lot a little bit<br>of snow and that wasn't um really an<br>issue for me at all I just put my jacket<br>on and carried on and it was fine um<br>wind could probably make it more<br>difficult with your micro s well I think<br>wind just makes it more difficult in<br>general because um being exposed to 30<br>knot wind for more than a couple of<br>hours at a time I mean it it it mentally<br>it drains your mental energy like you<br>feel exhausted um just in that wind it's<br>unrelenting um but there are I mean<br>having uh thick snow um accumulation on<br>the ground can be a safety issue as well<br>because you can't see the ground<br>therefore you don't see what you're<br>stepping on and the chance of you<br>twisting your ankle is much much greater<br>when that happens or you know stepping<br>through um thin eyes and falling into a<br>pawn so I would say that um having<br>having bad weather does make you tend<br>bound especially if there's a lot of<br>snow on the ground but otherwise it's<br>the it's just the wind it if the wind<br>keeps up it really is is is um<br>exhausting and the other thing with the<br>wind is we have like plastic bags and<br>Bits of Paper and pencils and things<br>we're trying to use for our sampling so<br>if it gets um very windy then it's kind<br>of hard to hold on to everything at the<br>same time so that's another absolutely<br>and and we've had um Marlo ask about<br>both of your research are your findings<br>relatable to to real world issues um and<br>and how so what have you discovered so<br>basically what can the work on<br>springtails tell us about um sort of<br>real world problems and and what can<br>work on microbes tell us about real<br>world applications I<br>suppose um so for springtails I'm just<br>studying out my research so I don't have<br>any results um yet but what I'm hoping<br>to find is um a difference in the<br>genetic populations so if ones that are<br>active when it's warm are genetically<br>different to ones that are active when<br>it's cold then if the temperatures can<br>continue to increase<br>um with um climate change then will that<br>cause the population that's active when<br>it's cold to be out competed and die out<br>and if it does then that's a loss of<br>biodiversity and it means that um<br>perhaps the population is going to have<br>less ability to adapt to further<br>changing environmental conditions and um<br>I guess in as more of a Global<br>Perspective if this is what's happening<br>to Antarctic um animals then maybe is<br>this going to happen to other animals<br>around the world as well and I guess<br>because Antarctica might be sort of the<br>first to respond so it's kind of a a<br>preliminary indicator of what might<br>happen elsewhere yeah I always say that<br>we certainly can view Antarctica as a<br>model system um that gives us insight<br>into a lot of processes and because for<br>us to understand what goes on in the<br>environment around us we need to<br>understand a lot of the fundamental<br>processes underpinning them quite often<br>the environment around us is far too<br>complex to to understand and so as<br>scientists we always have to um<br>basically tackle a a a problem at a<br>plausible scale and to go out and say<br>you know what would happen to an entire<br>Forest um if the the climate changed a<br>little bit is really hard to say but if<br>you can understand incrementally what<br>happens first to the microorganisms and<br>what happens to the springtails what<br>happens to the invertebrates what<br>happens to the insects and you tackle it<br>tackle it one piece at a time that gives<br>you a much better chance of<br>understanding what's happening and<br>Antarctica provides us with the<br>opportunity to take this um red<br>reductionistic approach to um to<br>understand the basic um processes um<br>around around<br>us yeah absolutely I mean it's such a<br>perfect sort of environment to be able<br>to test those things and see what what's<br>happening I guess in a a much simpler<br>ecosystem as he said um and we've had<br>soya Griffin ask um what is the biggest<br>organization that is currently operating<br>in Antarctica uh and Dean wants to know<br>are they mainly Australian and New<br>Zealand researchers down there um or is<br>it a mix of American and Europeans<br>working there as<br>well um this is gonna BR me to trouble<br>I'm I'm going to guess that the Lar<br>organization is different depending on<br>which metric you pick I think that<br>probably operates the largest number of<br>bases but the Americans probably spend<br>most<br>money and so I think it depend depending<br>on um how you how you define large um a<br>number of different programs would be in<br>the Forefront I would say the Chinese<br>and the Americans are certainly um among<br>among the biggest um within because<br>because the<br>um um because Scot base is only a stone<br>throw from MC Myrtle station it's only a<br>f minute drive to MC Myrtle station<br>there's certainly a lot of cost<br>fertilization between the two programs<br>so for example this year we have a we<br>had a American Science event sharing our<br>tent with us and that of course<br>increases the um the number of<br>international research in our team um<br>instantly and then we also had<br>researchers from Canada from Germany and<br>South Africa and in previous Seasons<br>we've had researchers from Hong Kong<br>from Korea from Spain from uh Portugal<br>so it's a very International environment<br>uh you would be I think you would<br>be um usual for a base to be entirely a<br>Australian or to be entirely<br>kiwi yeah absolutely and um we almost<br>out of time but a few more quick<br>questions um Andrew's been asking about<br>the logistics of working down there I<br>know we've talked about getting<br>everything shipped in and shipped out<br>but do you have do you get everything at<br>the start of your trip um or do you have<br>to rely on sort of weekly supply<br>drops it depends um I think it depends<br>on the scope of your um your operations<br>we do rely on resupply but mostly I<br>would say the main reason for that is<br>because we have samples that have to go<br>back so there's no point um taking<br>everything out to start because if we<br>have to have a helicopter out um come<br>out and take our samples back but<br>certainly if you manage uh if your your<br>the type of your operation allows it you<br>could go out um with all your supplies<br>and stay out there for three months this<br>this does happen people do do that uh<br>but for us because we have samples<br>constantly going back to um Scot base<br>that was not really that's not not<br>that's not how we operated how far is<br>the helicopter trip between Scot base<br>and the drive valys that you guys are<br>working in I think it was about 35<br>minutes yeah it's quite a long<br>way and what are you in the future are<br>you hoping to both stay working down in<br>Antarctica what's next for you<br>both um I have the next year for um<br>analyzing my samples and writing my<br>thesis but I don't really know what's<br>going to happen for me in the future I<br>guess there is potential if I if I want<br>to do a PhD or do some sort of other<br>work then I guess yeah if I put the<br>effort in if it's something I want to do<br>then I can yeah fantastic yeah no I<br>think I mean I at this point I um we're<br>we're certainly going back next year um<br>and we're hoping to get funding to go<br>back for the next um four to six years<br>so for the foreseeable future because<br>because there's so many um sence<br>scientific questions that remain to be<br>answered in Antarctica and uh that that<br>are very of of great interest to me so I<br>would certainly be going back uh in the<br>future if I can absolutely and um we<br>have one final question from Narin who<br>said what kind of research is being done<br>in Antarctica that could benefit space<br>pro programs around the world I don't<br>interesting um Antarctica is a great I<br>mean there's a lot of um astrophysics<br>research being done um particularly at<br>South Pole there's not a lot of New<br>Zealand funded programs to do that<br>because it's it's we're talking very<br>very big money um and I think we<br>also the by looking at Antarctica you<br>also have um ironically you can gain<br>insight into the history of the planet<br>um because of the um um the the thick<br>ice sheet that we can drill into and<br>that would feel a lot about what<br>happened to the planet um in previous uh<br>eons so in in somewhat indirect ways a<br>lot of research in Antarctica is related<br>to um space and um as um astronomical<br>research but I wouldn't be able to any<br>direct EV direct um examples because I<br>I'm not a<br>astrophysicist but I guess it's an<br>interesting Prospect for f for future<br>research and any potential<br>astrophysicists out there watching you<br>could could be heading to antactica soon<br>for work<br>absolutely thank you so much you guys<br>sadly we're out of time have we missed<br>anything that you think um the audience<br>may like to know that people don't often<br>know about your work in Antarctica or do<br>you think we've covered most of<br>it I think we've we've done a pretty<br>good job pretty good job um thank you<br>yeah it was a good range of thanks thank<br>you so much to everyone who's watching<br>and ask questions we really appreciate<br>it and um of course thank you to the<br>University of wadoo in New Zealand for<br>sponsoring our hangout today um if<br>you're interested in researching down in<br>Antarctica or working down there or<br>studying uh and finding out more about<br>some of the work being done um there'll<br>be a link in the description of this<br>video you can find out some more about<br>studying at yadoo um and most of all<br>thank you to Gema and Charles for being<br>such great guests and um asking<br>answering all our questions<br>thank you guys thank you thanks thank<br>you well we'll see you soon and we'll be<br>hosting lots more Hangouts so keep<br>following science leet on Facebook and<br>Twitter and let us know if there are any<br>scientists you'd like us to speak to</p></main><footer
