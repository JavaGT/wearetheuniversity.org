font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the vision for the chapel was to<br>enrich<br>the spiritual life of the university to<br>represent the christian faith which at<br>the time when it was first envisioned<br>back in the 1940s<br>the context was right for<br>the christian faith to be somehow become<br>part of the university community the<br>third vision was around<br>fostering christian and moral values in<br>the community and the fourth one being<br>to<br>for the chapel and the chaplaincy to be<br>a creative force in the life of the<br>university the building was designed by<br>the firm of gamma and ford<br>probably the most famous firm of<br>architects in the country it was first<br>funded in 1947<br>as a war memorial chapel sir william<br>goodfellow who was a businessman and<br>benefactor gave money towards that he<br>had lost his son in the fleet here<br>during the war so it's in memory of the<br>son but also of his uncle who was called<br>maclaurin<br>and that's where the name of the chapel<br>comes from so you can see in the whole<br>building there's a focus on letting<br>material speak for themselves which is a<br>big modernist idea so there's very<br>little in the way of decoration the<br>building and its materials do all the<br>work there's no stained glass for<br>instance the community space is a very<br>very important space for for the<br>students to relax<br>and to meet their friends and just to be<br>themselves the other thing that you<br>notice about the chapel is it almost<br>becomes sort of<br>circular or hexagonal<br>and there was a lot of reform in church<br>design at the time where the focus<br>became more on the congregation rather<br>than just on the minister so with the<br>lovely folded ceiling in the main chapel<br>you've got this lovely sense of everyone<br>being together and welcome and part of<br>one congregation the university today is<br>much much bigger<br>than what it was when the chapel was<br>built<br>and more so than ever the chapel space<br>is<br>the space where people can come<br>and and<br>reflect contemplate<br>and just<br>prayerfully reflect on their life and<br>and their career pathway and all that's<br>around them is so crucial because in the<br>busyness and the noisiness of the<br>university it's very hard to find that<br>quiet space<br>and the unit in the university chapel<br>the macron chapel<br>is that unique space in the university<br>and we treasure that and it's one one<br>space that we believe is so important<br>for our students and our staff to be<br>partial</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
