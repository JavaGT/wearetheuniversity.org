know you tell someone oh yeah I'm<br>doing proper itty again and they respond<br>why you know oh okay so you're doing<br>going to be a real estate agent and then<br>you just you know just face palm there's<br>so many different you know definitions<br>for property you know you can you can<br>look into real property you know the<br>land and buildings and the resources<br>around us um personal property private<br>property it's not just real estate um<br>you know there's a big focus on on the<br>commercial property Market property<br>professionals appear in every sector in<br>every country from residential valuation<br>and sales to operations management to<br>Global funds management property<br>Specialists have a vital role to play in<br>managing and growing these assets The<br>Bachelor of property degree is a great<br>degree for the wide range of topics it<br>offers you can cover everything from<br>Finance to valuation to marketing to<br>management to building surveying so you<br>can see that it's very practical but<br>also academic at the same time well I<br>started off my degree um I kind of<br>didn't know what I wanted to do for me<br>the Practical aspect of property is what<br>drew me to property coming to work every<br>day and just having a New Practical<br>experience instead of sitting at a desk<br>other degrees can be a little bit more<br>Theory based whereas this was a very<br>Hands-On degree these skills that you<br>pick up they're actually really valuable<br>to a non-property company I really like<br>the postgrad degree because you got to<br>learn what you did in undergrad you got<br>to to look into more detail I guess and<br>I quite liked that we do have a really<br>good close relationship with the<br>university we get applications from<br>other property graduates around the<br>country but um the vast majority of<br>graduates we employ would be from<br>Oakland and we've seen them those those<br>people have come from the University hit<br>the ground running and really flourish<br>in our business the University of<br>Oakland property degree is an accredited<br>degree by the RCs property degree at o<br>University is so well regarded overseas<br>and my experience of in Australia that<br>this property bu is really really right<br>out there with the very best Australia's<br>Got to offer as well I ended up moving<br>to London almost straight away after I<br>graduated the property degree gave me a<br>good sort of step in the door to the<br>property industry over there definitely<br>not left on your own while you're<br>Stelling here they do provide you with a<br>lot of um networking opportunities they<br>hold industry events they've got<br>lecturers from industry that come in to<br>teach um so right from the start you're<br>actually getting that really strong<br>connection to Industry for example we<br>had to prepare a marketing campaign for<br>go to Bailey's present it to make Bailey<br>the students are allowed to go and visit<br>the four big companies they give us um<br>drinks and nibbles and they give us an<br>overview of the market of an overview of<br>what the company does um which was a<br>really good insight as to what you've<br>been studying and then meeting the<br>people that actually do um do the<br>day-to-day job of the theories and and<br>things that you've studied about through<br>the degree for a degree why would you<br>want networking like that sounds so<br>weird to a future student but it's how<br>you get stuff done and the property work<br>we really value the undergraduates and<br>the graduates who come into the business<br>they provide lots of innovation um and<br>new ways of thinking and working um so<br>they are available to developing and<br>growing a business Goodman has been<br>involved for a long time with the Buddy<br>program um and we actually see and start<br>to network with the or university profer<br>Department students well in advance of<br>their graduation that prepares students<br>very well for the employment process the<br>people that you work with in the<br>industry quite often be the people that<br>you you were in class of a couple years<br>ago the department is kind of almost<br>like a family I guess so and you become<br>quite close with your classmates in<br>postgrad as well cuz there's only a few<br>of you and you're all doing the same<br>thing you know you can call up your<br>friend and say Hey you know can you help<br>me out with this because you've already<br>broken that barrier when I was at Uni I<br>was president of a which is the property<br>Students Association so we did the<br>mentoring the pub crawls which are<br>Infamous we did the class parties and<br>then we also do the end of year the big<br>function where gives you an opportunity<br>to network with people in the industry<br>and all of your friends the staff are<br>great you know I I had great friendships<br>with the staff um you know they were<br>sort of my my my friends as well they<br>were happy to speak with me I know that<br>if I wanted to go talk to any of them<br>they' be easily approachable and um<br>happy to help studying property and<br>working in property it's it's a passion<br>and honestly coming to work every day<br>and having something that is a hobby and<br>enjoy what you you do that's most<br>rewarding feeling in the whole world if<br>you definitely got any inclination<br>towards property or or you want to learn<br>more about it I would definitely<br>recommend um coming to study here at the<br>University of Oakland</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
