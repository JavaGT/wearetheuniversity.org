of the<br>University I would warmly like to<br>welcome staff students and members of<br>the general public who have all come to<br>share in the celebration of this<br>inaugural professorial lecture we are<br>all gathered here tonight to honor the<br>achievements of Professor Wayne gillet<br>currently he is the head of Women and<br>Children's Health here at the University<br>of itago he is also a consultant OBGYN<br>and he's The Clinical Director of the<br>atago fertility<br>Services Professor gillet has made a<br>number of outstanding contributions to<br>the university but he's also changed the<br>lives of his<br>patients in the current PBF environment<br>there is not a single researcher in this<br>room who will not be aware of the<br>importance of impact factors in<br>evaluating the perceived quality and<br>value of our<br>research but I think it's also important<br>for us to keep in mind that the research<br>conducted here at the University of<br>itago has other important impacts<br>Outside The Wider academic<br>Community the fact that so many of<br>Professor gillet's patients are actually<br>here in the audience this evening is a<br>clear Testament to the real human impact<br>of his work I would now like to hand<br>over to associate professor David Gerard<br>who is going to tell us a little bit<br>professorship Vice Chancellor Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor Professor Taylor other<br>university colleagues and<br>staff ladies and<br>gentlemen it's with a great deal of<br>personal pleasure this evening that I<br>introduce Professor Wayne gillet the<br>fifth in a line of outstanding academic<br>clinicians to have occupied the chair In<br>Obstetrics and Gynecology in the denan<br>school of medicine University of<br>otago I'm also delighted to welcome<br>members of Wayne's immediate family who<br>are here this evening with a special<br>acknowledgement to Mrs gillet<br>senior from what we might today consider<br>a humble<br>rural<br>background Wayne's proud Roots were in<br>tamuka South Canterbury where he emerged<br>from tamuka high school as an<br>outstanding<br>scholar in 1968 at the University of<br>oaro he successfully completed his<br>medical intermediate year ultimately<br>1973 thereafter followed house surgeon<br>and reg<br>years at theen hospital by which time a<br>career path In Obstetrics and<br>determined this decision took Wayne to<br>the Hammersmith Hospital London a<br>lectureship in<br>om and training in microsurgical<br>techniques under the tutelage of none<br>other than the Lord Robert<br>Winston concurrently Wayne applied<br>himself to clinical and research<br>obligations to the World Health<br>Organization during his time in London<br>Professor gillet completed studies of<br>the ovarian surface<br>epithelium describing two cell types and<br>attributing the scram cells to<br>metaplasia from the previous trauma of<br>ovulation thereby changing the existing<br>perception in the field and this work<br>for his higher degree has has never been<br>superseded early in his career Wayne<br>collaborated with social policy<br>colleagues to follow up families<br>involved in third party<br>reproduction the lives of these families<br>have flourished not the least because of<br>these data and the consequent Law<br>changes in many countries including<br>Australia Sweden and the United<br>Kingdom Professor gillet has published a<br>major review of chronic pelvic pain an<br>outstanding in work in this poorly<br>developed field providing sound<br>neuroanatomical and neurophysiological<br>bases for a spectrum of<br>therapies the rare Award of a fellowship<br>of the faculty of pain medicine of the<br>Australian and New Zealand College of<br>entists demonstrated their respect for<br>his work in this<br>field Wayne has provided a long-standing<br>clinical service for perplexing yet<br>common problem<br>and here at the Denon hospital and the<br>medical school he's worked in curricular<br>changes including the development of the<br>Women's Health module and the<br>evidence-based approach to clinical<br>practice offered to Junior medical<br>students in May<br>2012 Wayne gillet was appointed as<br>academic head of Women's and Children's<br>Health assuming responsibility for the<br>combined Departments of Pediatrics and<br>om<br>similar similarly he and simultaneously<br>I should say he has worked as an OM<br>specialist for the Southern dhb and<br>since<br>1983 has developed and delivered<br>infertility services to a standard that<br>has earned International<br>recognition by his work on patient<br>Pathways D data analysis and decision<br>making plus the ability for government<br>liaison patients of the Southern d HB<br>have benefited<br>immensely so it's now with great<br>pleasure I invite Professor Wang gillet<br>to present his inaugural professorial<br>lecture entitled the three PS of Queen<br>okay<br>May Teno Koto C thank you very much Vice<br>Chancellor and David for that that very<br>generous um introduction and certainly<br>I'm uh standing here very proudly in<br>front of so many friends and family<br>um it is it is quite a daunting although<br>it's a privilege uh to be here I have a<br>lot of family here and I want to with uh<br>Diane um welcome um uh two of our three<br>children uh Robert and<br>Sarah uh I have uh my brothers and<br>sisters or four of them uh Lynn Pam uh<br>Wendy my twin sister and Brent and their<br>um and their family Bob um John Sarah<br>and<br>Nicole and of course I'm very proud to<br>have my dear Mother here too and<br>actually this is the first time I'm<br>lecture I want to welcome a number of<br>special guests who will be the subject<br>of this uh lecture there are Sally<br>Brahman and Jane and their families and<br>uh there's Professor dick seden<br>Professor Don Wilson and family um and<br>also Al the families of s Berard Dawson<br>and Professor Lawrence Wright are also<br>here in the audience I want to<br>particularly thank John Dawson who is a<br>professor of the faculty um of Law and<br>John gave me some<br>valuable uh material for the preparation<br>of this<br>lecture I also want to thank uh Karen<br>Grant who helped me with some of my<br>research into the content of this<br>lecture I have one apology from my<br>brother Ross who offered me some advice<br>he suggested the first thing I should do<br>is relax the audience he said why don't<br>you ask them did they know uh that in<br>the Canary Islands there are no<br>Chancellor so why the three PS of Queen<br>Mary this year Queen Mary<br>held at 75th uh Jubilee celebrations and<br>this lecture is sort of the last of the<br>celebration functions uh there's such a<br>rich history on Queen Mary that I simply<br>had to uh choose the subject for this<br>lecture for those involved in uh<br>childbirth you will realize that the<br>three PS are a play on words of what we<br>frequently refer to the three PS of<br>labor but in this case they are the<br>refer to the places people and<br>patience for the<br>places I will briefly recount the<br>history of each of the three Queen Mary<br>Hospitals in denen then for the people<br>although there are so many I could pay<br>tribute to I will confine my<br>presentation to the professors that<br>preceded me all serve the university and<br>and Queen Mary with distinction and it<br>is an honor and indeed humbling for me<br>to be nested beside them in the 75 years<br>there have been four professors<br>in the same period there' have been 11<br>Deans and I finally uh want to pay<br>tribute to three women Sally Brahman and<br>Jane and their babies that I've had the<br>privilege to know and manage their care<br>normally women and babies are<br>represented by numbers and statistics<br>but in this lecture I do want to give<br>them an identity for they represent me<br>and they represent what is Queen Mary it<br>is not usual to present such explicit<br>and personal information about patients<br>and the public forum but all three have<br>consented for me to tell their stories<br>theyve represent many thousands of women<br>Grace Queen Mary facilities in the last<br>75 years and they represent the courage<br>and strength that many women have to<br>face when reproductive Health becomes<br>uncertain and frequently<br>unfair they all deserve to stand on the<br>high pedestal alongside these exalted<br>buildings and professors and I indeed um<br>overwhelmed that all three of them are<br>here<br>today<br>so where does this story begin in 1921<br>James par the minister of Health learned<br>that more New Zealand mothers died on<br>child birth than in in than in any any<br>other developed Nation apart from the<br>United States of America in 1920 it was<br>6.5 per thousand cases he thought these<br>figures would jeopardize New Zealand's<br>Public Health reputation and appointed a<br>special committee to identify the causes<br>and cure for maternal mortality there<br>was a public outcry when they learned<br>that the department had known about this<br>for many years and it was this single<br>event in New Zealand's health history<br>that ultimately ultimately led to the<br>opening of 17 years later of Queen Mary<br>Hospital in<br>1937 the direction of maternity care in<br>New Zealand was changed by two people in<br>particular uh both influencing the<br>arrival of the first professor of<br>Obstetrics and Gynecology in the<br>building of a new hospital<br>the first was Henry jalot an<br>obstetrician working in Christ Church<br>who had been the master of retunda in<br>Dublin galot favored the abandonment<br>abandonment of New Zealand's 200 private<br>maternity homes to be replaced by a<br>large teaching hospitals he also<br>stressed the need to establish a chair<br>In Obstetrics and Gynecology at Thea<br>medical school and influenced the<br>General Medical Council to require all<br>graduating doctors to have 20 deliveries<br>in their<br>training the second individual was the<br>dynamic Secretary of the New Zealand om<br>Society Dr Doris Gordon who in the late<br>1920s led a nationwide appeal uh for<br>funds to endow a national chair of<br>Obstetrics and build a maternity<br>hospital in the<br>Eden and so came our first Professor one<br>Joseph Bernard Dawson called by his<br>second name Bernard and later to become<br>kned for his services to<br>obstetric this is uh um s Bernard and<br>his family at his 80th birthday John<br>Dawson is the boy in the front and his<br>mother mayford is holding the baby and<br>too this Photograph show s Bernard and<br>his wife Norah in the midst of the slump<br>SAA took up his appointment in February<br>1932 at the age of 48 he was an English<br>graduate and with a great interest in<br>obstetrics from the very beginning of<br>his medical career and ultimately took<br>him to Adelaide where he worked as a GP<br>for 20<br>years it was this long service to<br>general practice that influenced his own<br>style as a professor and his dedication<br>to teaching of cetric before taking up<br>uh the role he made a t of Europe and<br>the United States to assess amongst<br>other things the standard of care that<br>made maternal mortality figures in<br>Europe seemingly better than in New<br>Zealand he found to his astonishment<br>that comparing maternal mortality uh<br>with New Zealand wasn't<br>impossible many countries had not<br>adopted the international C causes of<br>death and he wrote published figures did<br>not reveal the whole<br>story and that the quality of<br>recordkeeping and the statistics were so<br>poor that no just comparison could be<br>made with those of British countries so<br>maybe New Zealand wasn't bad off after<br>all these excerpts are from his<br>unpublished autobiography written in the<br>third person using a pseudonym and given<br>insight into a man fully dedicated to<br>the craft of teaching and the importance<br>of practical<br>training I will use some of his excerpts<br>to illustrate the man he was and for the<br>sake of Simplicity I will convert those<br>person when he arrived in New Zealand<br>all medical<br>students uh medical student teaching was<br>performed at The Bachelor Hospital in<br>Fourth Street this is a photograph I<br>took just a few weeks ago showing that<br>the house is still<br>there when he arrived Bernard Dawson<br>found training at obstetric was Dreadful<br>he found a poing training conditions the<br>small 12- bed Bachelor hospital was<br>substandard and he described the anti<br>antinal Clinic as even<br>worse as a relic of the 19th century and<br>compared to the hospitals I visited in<br>Europe and the United States it's<br>frankly appalling I had the chair but<br>little<br>else the other main maternity Hospital<br>in denan was uh in was St Helens in<br>Regent Road this was the second of the<br>seven St hen hospitals that were opened<br>in the early 1900s a scheme introduced<br>by the Prime Minister sedan for the dual<br>purpose of training midwives and<br>providing maternity care for mothers<br>struggling to rare families on small<br>incomes ultimately very few medical<br>students were allowed in St hen<br>hospitals and so the only and if so only<br>women students to increase his students<br>practical experience a burer took it<br>upon himself to personalize to<br>personally supervise almost every<br>delivery attended by medical<br>students he got into the habit of being<br>summoned as soon as possible after the<br>onset of Labor to ensure as much as<br>possible of the phenomena of<br>childbirth and he wrote this lasted six<br>years with no doubt irritability when<br>tired he was affectionately known as<br>Bernie by student students and<br>frequently engaged in what he called the<br>fourth stage of<br>Labor the first three stages happily<br>completed he enjoyed a cup of tea hot<br>butter toast with discussions reminisces<br>and<br>Yarns to increase attendance at antinal<br>clinics s Berard introduced what he<br>described as a device for screening the<br>patients for examination so that the<br>head and shoulders were hidden from<br>students and he wrote that this was a<br>desirable provision against<br>embarrassment and reluctance to face<br>thorough investigation it actually<br>clinics so what was his<br>character and what can he be remembered<br>for he was certainly modest when he<br>described his work as unspectacular<br>simply personal close attention to daily<br>routine and for 20 years he maintained a<br>detailed record of every patient and<br>published reports for every 1,000<br>obstetric patients<br>when he retired has reports covered<br>12,000 obstetric cases and over 11,000<br>gynecological patients and they were the<br>first reports issued by the department<br>by any Department in the medical<br>school this in Insight from his<br>autobiography certainly explains both<br>his directness and what one student<br>explained as handsome arrogance whilst<br>at the same time being a shy man I was a<br>single-minded oneeyed de devotee to my<br>task of teaching having few outside<br>interests an attitude which augmenting<br>my inherent shyness made me less and<br>less gregarious and more isolated and<br>self-sufficient this is a famous<br>caricature of medical school staff<br>showing s Bernard on the left perhaps<br>illustrating some of his<br>feelings towards some of his academic<br>colleagues so Horus smirk is the one on<br>the right with the immensely long<br>stethoscope apparently that that was for<br>real here are some passages and what s<br>had thought about them<br>I was despondent at the disappearing<br>class of mentors with a background of<br>general practice being replaced by men<br>of specialized training who from the<br>outset of their career Aspire<br>appointments in medical school schools<br>and this is what he thought about the<br>requirements of a professor the role of<br>of a professor as the head of a team<br>must remain that of a teacher as well as<br>a<br>mentor he should personally engage in<br>the Practical as well as the systematic<br>instruction be willing to take a full<br>share of the even Elementary<br>classes and not be content to emerge<br>occasionally from his Laboratories to<br>utter some pontifical remarks or deliver<br>an infrequent<br>lecture he is appointed to teach and<br>give students the benefits of his own<br>practical knowledge and experience if he<br>has not had enough of these then his<br>appointment was a<br>mistake I don't think sabanda would<br>approve of today's standards to become a<br>professor he wrote today there is talk<br>of surgery or obstetrics as a un<br>University career a conception that is<br>absurd and dangerous they are both<br>crafts the exponents of which must be in<br>daily contact with their practical<br>applications if they to remain good<br>Craftsmen and teachers and then when<br>vacancies occur advertisements for<br>successors put more and more stress upon<br>research chairs of essential practical<br>subjects are being filled by men who are<br>undoubtedly able scientists but of<br>limited clinical experience<br>I'm not sure that's true<br>today so Bernard's Legacy was immense<br>that he was Ned speaks for himself as<br>well as well as developing the very<br>first obstetric curriculum he was<br>heavily involved in medical politics at<br>one stage being the president of the New<br>Zealand division of the British Medical<br>Association he is regarded as the father<br>of New Zealand Obstetrics and did so<br>much to enhance the<br>standards of the profession in New<br>Zealand<br>he achieved immense satisfaction in<br>raising the standards and safety of<br>child birth as this slide testifies in<br>the dramatic reduction of maternal<br>mortality that coincided with his tenure<br>and after his retirement s Berard served<br>on the Tigo Hospital board for seven<br>years and was a major advocate in<br>supporting the new Anda Queen Mary<br>Hospital Queen Mary number<br>two and of course he was the driver<br>behind the very first Queen Mary he<br>spent many years battling for this new<br>hospital even though each pound of the<br>cost was to be matched by the health<br>department he described the local<br>hospital board as showing no<br>encouragement some old members with<br>their feet in the '90s and their heads<br>in the clouds still held that the<br>existing miserable facilities were<br>satisfactory and many held that it was<br>the business of the Department of Health<br>to look after maternity needs and worse<br>still the government reneged on building<br>the promised Hospital funding for the<br>hospital was finally settled but at a<br>reduced capacity it was to be a 44 bed<br>hospital but in the end there was only<br>enough money for<br>26 the decision to limitus 26 was<br>regretted almost from the start with the<br>baby boom of the postwar years soon<br>beginning to impose serious pressures on<br>hospital beds note the low number of<br>cesarians this equates to rates of about<br>2 3 4% and but in St contrast uh to<br>almost immediately plans were put in<br>place to expand the building and the<br>extensions were eventually opened in<br>1952 and comprised an antinal clinic and<br>a Gynecology Clinic both of which were<br>in existence during my training for the<br>first time the maternity hospital had a<br>premature baby unit there was also a new<br>the new addition of a flat that was used<br>by regist and in which Diane and I lived<br>for a year this recent photograph was<br>taken from Denon Hospital's fourth floor<br>and shows the major extensions over here<br>there the second floor by the way was<br>accommodation for nurses due to<br>regulations for the control of sepsis<br>they could not live in the nurse's home<br>where they might contact nurses who had<br>been nursing septic<br>cases now the that Queen Mary is now<br>occupied by the surveying School<br>so Bernard retained his chair until age<br>68 before being longer than he wanted<br>and he wrote the idea of finding a<br>successor was hampered by by the war not<br>supplying well-trained<br>aspirants as to a successor he<br>identified Lawrence Wright who had a<br>distinguished War record and attained<br>the rank of Lieutenant<br>Colonel as Bernard Dawson wrote his<br>postwar training gained him higher<br>qualifications and experience in London<br>with a promptitude that beckoned energy<br>and<br>ability some of the selection committee<br>thought him too young for the<br>responsibilities of the Prof Professor<br>chair but sir Vernard pushed hard for<br>his appointment as he knew him well as a<br>student and as a house student as they<br>seen here in this<br>Photograph yet<br>considerable respects respect for his<br>character entertainments and he wrote<br>the future amply Justified this faith in<br>man Lawrence Wright was appointed as the<br>second professor in<br>1951 and I had the privilege of working<br>with him during my training as a house<br>surgeon in 1975 then during my regist<br>years from 1976 to the end of<br>1978 one of Lawrence W's early Visions<br>to was to have even a bigger hospital<br>that would accommodate both Clinic<br>patients and those managed by General<br>Practitioners a so-called open Hospital<br>the plans were actually drawn up before<br>the extensions of the first Queen Mary<br>were completed and it took another 10<br>years of deliberations before Queen Mary<br>number two was opened in<br>1961 it was intriguing to note that the<br>sites considered for qu Mary at the time<br>included marinot wui Parkside all<br>ultimately becoming other medical<br>institutions so this became Queen Mary<br>number<br>two an early blow in the development of<br>the new hospital was the realization it<br>was going to be tur expensive and one of<br>Lawrence W's accomplishments was his<br>persuasion to retain the top floor but<br>as a shell for future<br>use for the first time in a modern<br>obstetrics hospital it included the<br>cesarian section theater and this was a<br>major accomplishment as Lawrence Wright<br>had a great deal of resistance from the<br>needen hospital he wrote theater sisters<br>were a formidable<br>breed KN to guard zealously their domain<br>and resenting any attempt to carve off<br>individual Empires I'm sure they're not<br>today lawence Wright oversaw some major<br>advances in obstetric practice including<br>the integration of anesthetic Services<br>into Queen Mary but also neonatal<br>care that eventually found a modern home<br>in 1971 with the opening of the shell<br>and this Photograph was actually<br>published in their target dat times just<br>a few weeks ago with Donald Malcolm's<br>obituary this enabled the total care of<br>all mothers and their babies in the same<br>building it is my impression of<br>reviewing morbidity and mortality<br>statistics of the period that since the<br>first crary was opened the standard of<br>obstetric care has been of the highest<br>order and Lawrence writes tenure of 30<br>years not one patient under the care of<br>the clinic died there were 10 deaths in<br>the period all emergency cases and<br>pregnancy in his tenure he developed an<br>important clinical collaborations with<br>hypertension and diabetes Specialists<br>and maternal and Nal outcomes were<br>excellent he was proud that no case of<br>eclampsia occurred in any of the clinic<br>patients under his care his most<br>endearing quality I believe was his<br>ability to work with his Juniors almost<br>on equal terms his ability to nurture<br>the highest skill set in whatever you<br>did he always acted as an assistant to<br>the junior who he regarded as the<br>primary operator I cannot ever recall<br>when he was the primary operator his<br>attitude was if your Deputy is not<br>learning to do things better than what<br>you do you're failing in your task and<br>this is a quality I've tried hard to to<br>declare in my own teaching and mentoring<br>it was no wonder that as a relatively<br>young registra leaving New Zealand for<br>the United Kingdom my skill set at<br>operative delivery and abdominal surgery<br>was as good as one could ask<br>for it is not surprising that with this<br>trust and Leadership came I believe<br>Lawrence right greatest achievement with<br>the engagement of primary care and<br>routine obstetric practice Queen Mary<br>number two became a unique environment<br>in New Zealand where GPS could stand<br>side by side with Specialists and<br>practice their medicine In Obstetrics in<br>Hospital there was no doubt that under<br>Lawrence Wright's tenure Queen Mary was<br>a renowned institution that attracted<br>many famous visitors world leaders and<br>obstetrics in Gynecology were frequent<br>visitors in our department d<br>has numerous photos of distinguished<br>people who came to theen so last Town's<br>end uh from Melbourne's on the right was<br>a frequent visitor and on the left is<br>Sir Alex Turnbull who was a president of<br>the British college so was Sir Hector<br>mclenon on the left and a young bit<br>Gerald on the right this Photograph was<br>first published published in the denan<br>evening star and it is of Interest sir<br>Hector told the reporter that test you<br>babies are further away than an<br>interplanetary<br>travel actually the first IV IVF baby<br>just came 30 years<br>later this photo is of another College<br>president sarur Bell on the right with s<br>Berard Dawson a photo taken shortly<br>before s berard's<br>death since Lawrence rice tenure I don't<br>think we can boast as many visitors as<br>he<br>managed but we might claim the most<br>famous as Dave suggested we here we have<br>both Lawrence Wright and dick siden with<br>Lord Robert Winston who has visited our<br>department on two<br>occasions other fond memories I have of<br>Lawrence wght included his exhilarating<br>speech at our Queen Mary 60th<br>anniversary celebrations 15 years ago<br>another was the support and pride he had<br>for his Midwife colleagues and most of<br>all his<br>patience this uh photo uh captur some of<br>the fun times the Midwife scrum at the<br>annual rugby match with the doctor<br>Al last this annual event was last paid<br>in 1978 when I was a<br>regist the maton put a stop to it after<br>one of The Midwives suffered a fractured<br>collarbone well that was one version of<br>the events I suspect it was because she<br>didn't approve of the communal shower we<br>had<br>afterwards deck Sedin became the third<br>professor of OMG in 1981 now had the<br>privilege of working with him from 1983<br>until his retirement in<br>1992 it is intriguing he shared the same<br>exact name as New Zealand's longest<br>serving prime minister and it is also<br>ironic that where the premier Dex sedan<br>introduced St Helen's Hospital St hen's<br>Hospital Network in New Zealand it was<br>our professor dick SED who who had an<br>influence on their closure with the<br>building of the new high-tech uh Women's<br>Hospital in Wellington it wasn't logical<br>to have both the new hospital and the<br>old<br>and contrary to the accolades for the<br>Prime Minister SED for making s hens<br>possible it was RJ Sedin gynecologist<br>who got the flag from the public out cry<br>for closing them as it happens deck was<br>a distant relative of the famous prime<br>minister his grandfather was a<br>cousin deck graduated in 1953 and was<br>taught by Lawrence Wright here is a<br>photograph of deck and as fellow<br>students on their obstetric attachment<br>he describes his experience in queary as<br>being like a gun crew with positioned By<br>Numbers number one was the ausher number<br>two held the leg number three would<br>clamp the cord down to number six who<br>scrubbed the<br>floor deck recalls his first birth to<br>his horror was an unexpected storb<br>birth de began his postgraduate<br>obstetric training in dened in 1959 and<br>ultimately he became a success he he he<br>he began a successfully academic career<br>in 1965 especially in reproductive<br>Endocrinology amongst his other early<br>accomplishments was the introduction of<br>a laparoscopy introduction of vapos into<br>New Zealand and he performed the very<br>first procedure from a makeshift<br>laparoscope made from a<br>ccope de was appointed to the foundation<br>chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology in<br>Wellington in 1975 and from there his<br>service to Obstetrics and Gynecology<br>grew immensely serving on numerous<br>governing bodies in New Zealand and<br>internationally the these included his<br>presidency of the new zealan college and<br>working for the World Health<br>Organization on the maternal and child<br>health uh committee perhaps his most<br>important achievement was the work he<br>did for the Asia and Oceana Federation<br>of Obstetrics and<br>Gynecology leading the design and<br>content of its education program this<br>Federation is an amalgamation of all the<br>colleges of obstetric and Gynecology in<br>oana and Asia he would have become its<br>president if it had not been for his<br>health that also shortened his time into<br>needing he remains as one of the<br>federation's 18 fellows only 18 can be<br>held at any one time for living<br>members he was an inspiring teacher and<br>his legacy in teaching obstetrics was<br>the idea that pregnancy was an<br>interaction between the fetus and the<br>mother and the fetus was the dominant<br>party this is now universally accepted<br>but at the time was Radical<br>thinking if it was Dick s's tenure that<br>Queen Mary introduced the alternative<br>birthing unit that closely linked was<br>closely linked to the delivery Suite on<br>the first floor it was designed so women<br>could labor and deliver in an atmosphere<br>similar to a private home it had a main<br>bedroom linking kitchen and second<br>bedroom and in this photo our two sons<br>are entertaining themselves whilst in<br>the main bedroom Tom fitus and sad<br>Perman are ning away seemingly oblivious<br>it was here in December 1984 that our<br>daughter Sarah was<br>born um and she was the second um baby<br>to be born in the unit this photo shows<br>Diane Simon and Robert uh who was<br>holding Sarah even though I was an<br>optrician entrenched with a mind of<br>safety I was surprised that this was a<br>unique and wonderful experience the loss<br>of this amazing<br>facility was a huge casual uh the loss<br>was a huge casualty when Queen Mary<br>1990 it was Dex mentoring and support<br>from my colleagues that enabled me to<br>develop a renowned microsurgery Center<br>in Den Eden it was he who came to my<br>assistance with one of the most dramatic<br>moments in my career so it is with micro<br>surgery and that dramatic moment that I<br>want to present two of my patients the<br>stories of two women with very different<br>and contrasting<br>outcomes<br>the first was Sally and her children who<br>represent the many tens of thousands of<br>women and their babies who had normal<br>births in Queen Mary and Sally is<br>special to me because her story<br>influenced my own thinking and Research<br>into the remodeling capacity of the<br>damaged fallopian<br>tube she is also a midwife shown here in<br>the middle and has become a loyal friend<br>and colleague being a professional<br>practice fellow in our department for<br>many years looking after our fourth year<br>students and practiceing iing Midwifery<br>to the highest<br>level she was referred to me in 1985 for<br>a microsurgical anastomosis of her only<br>foping tube Sally and Ken had<br>experienced a devastating loss of two of<br>their three children John and Anne in a<br>car<br>accident she had only one flopin tube<br>after a previous rather destructive<br>sterilization and after micro surgery I<br>advised her of the Grim news that her<br>prognosis was less than ideal 30% of the<br>most<br>s did eventually conceive although it<br>took about 18 months and I was<br>privileged to deliver Kate who is now 26<br>years old and in the following two years<br>Matt and Campbell arrived with no period<br>of fertility delay<br>whatsoever and this is 20 years later<br>with their older brother Rob um who<br>survived the car accident prior to this<br>experience with Sally I had considered<br>the possibility of pregnancy's<br>regenerative abilities and s's own<br>experience seemed to have suggested this<br>indeed when I sterilized her a year<br>later her chbe was entirely normal to<br>examine the hypothesis that pregnancy<br>improves tubal function I obtained an<br>HRC Grant to follow over 300 of my own<br>cases for up to eight years and found<br>that no matter what the original<br>pathology was or how bad the damage tube<br>if a woman did successfully conceive a<br>first pregnancy then her subsequent<br>fertility was close to normal this<br>Remains the only published uh study ever<br>published for this type of this type and<br>suggested that the tube did regenerate<br>and remodel with pregnancy but that's<br>where the hypothesis remains surgery was<br>not normally a good option for tubal<br>disease and it was only in the hands of<br>microsurgeons that anyone did any good<br>the trouble was that there was not<br>enough of us and it didn't take long for<br>IVF to overwhelm the surgical management<br>of tubal infertility and so this<br>regenerative hypothesis will never ever<br>be<br>confirmed for bronwin her story is very<br>different and she represents the<br>adversity that confronts all of us in<br>obstetric practice in brahma's case she<br>not only lost her baby but she also lost<br>her uterus but what she did hold on to<br>was the extraordinary courage and<br>immense trust and mutual respect to her<br>caregivers including me that makes a<br>practicing medicine so rewarding despite<br>adversity even now 25 years later her<br>case is the most dramatic I've<br>experienced in Queen Mary<br>Brahman and Brian had one child Matthew<br>born 3 years earlier her pregnancy was<br>complicated by a percent Previa and at<br>27 weeks she had a torrential Hemorrhage<br>for which I was called about midnight as<br>the OB oberti on call by the time we got<br>brah to theater she had lost probably<br>60% of her blood volume she was in Dire<br>Straits that required the most expert of<br>resuscitation and immediate delivery<br>Rees James was born by cesarian section<br>but in spite of initial good progress he<br>died at 18 hours of age of severe<br>respiratory distress<br>syndrome for bramman my personal battle<br>had only just started she was bleeding<br>torrentially and the only way we could<br>save her was to physically compress all<br>major bleeders and tried to stem the<br>blood flow while the anesthetist Dr<br>David Jones who's also in the audience<br>fought to get the her blood pressure<br>back with her blood pressure recovering<br>I had to per perform a hysterctomy to<br>save her life but releasing the<br>compression only increased bleeding<br>again and so for the next 3 to 4 hours<br>we alternated between surgery and<br>resuscitation before we had control I<br>had called Dick siden to help me and by<br>the time we finished bronwood had lost<br>and had replaced three times her blood<br>volume this is Brahman and Reese<br>together unfortunately after he had lost<br>his battle Brahman made a full recovery<br>and she and Brian requested surrogacy<br>using her sister-in-law's um<br>sister-in-law and was the first ever IV<br>of surrogacy attempt in Den<br>Eden this is where we obtain eggs from<br>obtained eggs from Brahman and through<br>IVF the resulting embryo was transferred<br>into the surate sadly the pregnancy<br>miscarried and Brahman and bride did not<br>pursue any more treatment they adopted<br>Michael in 1995 here being fed by<br>Matthew<br>after about a year after my experience<br>with<br>bromin theago area Theo Health Board had<br>second thoughts about the future of<br>Queen Mary the finance committee had<br>argued that the current building was too<br>costly and the shift to denan hospital<br>was appropriate at stake was the loss of<br>identity of Queen Mary and the loss of<br>the alternative birthing area that still<br>remained the only one of its type in New<br>Zealand this is what um Our Midwives<br>thought about Professor Michael Cooper<br>who was the chairman of the board the<br>intended move raised much public ey even<br>in the the denan city council was<br>horrified to learn that there had been<br>no consultation with clinicians and that<br>has a familiar Perpetual ring to<br>it a protest March of 600 did not change<br>things although on the day of the March<br>Professor Cooper assured everyone that<br>closure was only one of the options<br>considered and that relocation would not<br>happen if the present high standard of<br>maternity care could not be guaranteed<br>even a final decision one month later to<br>relocate was counted by platitudes from<br>the board's chairman still trying to say<br>face in dealing with petition signed by<br>20,000<br>people this attitude by the board is in<br>distinct contrast to that held in<br>1987 where during the 50th anniversary<br>of Queen Mary Professor Lawrence Wright<br>described Queen Mary as the jewel in the<br>tiger District Health board's Crown no<br>other institution can have had such an<br>effect on the lives or welfare of the<br>citizens of<br>denen leading the<br>charge against closure was Tom fitus<br>here is a photograph captured by Thea<br>times and another and another delightful<br>paper all of this was ignored uh and<br>quen Mary was finally vacated in March<br>1990<br>it was brought by the university and is<br>now a hall of residence Haywood College<br>I often reflect on what might have been<br>the enormous space issues we now have in<br>denan hospital may have been averted if<br>building the third Queen Mary opened in<br>16 on the 16th of March 1990 not as a<br>hospital but as a center the staff took<br>some comfort from the decision by the<br>board to build a purpose built unit in<br>the ward block with its own entrance and<br>identity although it has formed the<br>working environment for me for the last<br>23 years it doesn't quite capture the<br>presence of a standalone building in my<br>view the identity of Queen Mary has<br>sadly diminished even some birth noes<br>refer to the the delivery at denen<br>hospital and not Queen Mary but not so<br>the staff in my 40 years working with<br>Obstetrics and midy practice I have had<br>nothing but respect for the working<br>relationship between the doctor and the<br>Midwife and I do want to share with you<br>some images of of amazing people that<br>I've worked<br>with this is my favorite photograph<br>showing all the attributes of Midwifery<br>and maternity care the photo is of the<br>late Ruth Moore holding baby George who<br>cedia deon's first child this Photograph<br>captures the Purity sensitivity and<br>warmth of the midy profession that I'm<br>so proud to be part of and I know all of<br>my predecessors were equally is proud of<br>this<br>relationship this Photograph not only<br>captures the essence of a doctor Midwife<br>relationship it alsoo describes two<br>people that have been important to me<br>since I started work as a house surgeon<br>in<br>1975 the first is Beverly<br>Henderson um and oh sorry they they<br>Beverly Henderson and maray white<br>captured here at the Jubilee ball last<br>year Beverly was probably the first uh<br>Midwife I worked with when I entered<br>obstetric training<br>and led them at delivery sweet team for<br>many years including the difficult<br>transition period between Queen Mary 2<br>number two and the Queen Mary maternity<br>Center and Mary was a loyal GP of<br>colleague and friend and had an immense<br>reputation Mary has probably delivered<br>more children than anyone in Queen Mary<br>with his retirement so went the backbone<br>of the GP obstetrician that no longer<br>exists I do want to honor Elanor<br>Cunningham in this Photograph at last<br>year is uh Jubilee ball and on the right<br>is Bunty Graham and these are the only<br>people I know of who actually worked in<br>all of the three Queen Mary's I do<br>apologize if I have admitted others that<br>I'm not aware<br>of Queen Mary has graced many wonderful<br>matrons the first being uh Phyllis<br>Clifford and in this Photograph Miss<br>middle she followed um<br>um Miss um Clifford as maton and in this<br>unique photograph in 1987 at the 50th<br>anniversary of Queen Mary Nora is seated<br>in the front row there and most of you<br>will know uh narri Corell who did so<br>much for the mid for Midwifery in the<br>70s and the<br>80s this brings me uh to the fourth<br>Professor Don Wilson Who was appointed<br>to the chair in<br>1995 Don came to New Zealand in 1980<br>having completed his<br>training in Glasgow Zimbabwe then<br>Manchester even as a registar he formed<br>a reputation In Obstetrics as this early<br>publication suggests as a registar he<br>was developing and name from but his<br>other strong interest was in Euro<br>Gynecology where he has ultimately<br>excelled this Photograph was taken at<br>the 60th anniversary with Lawrence<br>Wright Don has in my view been the most<br>accur mic of all the<br>professors he is not yet retired yet but<br>already he has published over 150 PE<br>reviewed articles and in his time in the<br>department secured 24 Grands this is a<br>phenomenal effort for someone who was<br>also responsible for a clinical load<br>involving on on call work and many<br>nights of broken sleep that a non-all<br>obstetric duties<br>demand his early tenure also meant<br>heading the clinical Department as well<br>and so one wonders how he could have a<br>achieved what he<br>did for those who uh know our current<br>setup it was he who initiated the<br>Handover rounds and at the beginning we<br>were in rather cramped quarters in the<br>Tea Room in the delivery<br>Suite in my view it was obstetrics loss<br>that he gave up this discipline in the<br>last 10 years of his working<br>life for he was a formidable teacher In<br>Obstetrics and practiced to the highest<br>of Standards although obstetric had a<br>loss it was urugon ecology's gain that<br>he has become one of the international<br>leaders in the field both as a clinician<br>and a<br>researcher I guess his app obstetric<br>bent is shown in this urugon ecology<br>work that he is now most recognized for<br>initiating the prolong study the<br>international longitudinal study of<br>women with after an index birth and this<br>started as recruitment for a randomized<br>control trial but it converted into<br>something much larger than he could have<br>realized at the time it has planned to<br>continue the study with an International<br>collaborators until 2015 to provide<br>unique 20-year<br>data he also excelled in teaching and<br>had a unique style that engaged the<br>students and this is one of his slides<br>he began some of his tutorials with of<br>his trademark being to involve his<br>students in their learning tell me and I<br>forget teach me and I remember involve<br>me and I learn and who can forget the<br>he would have all the students on their<br>feet conducting their way to their<br>learning I've certainly been proud to be<br>Don's colleague and for many years he L<br>both the academic and Technical<br>departments promoting a happy Department<br>with many fun<br>times and here is a photograph of some<br>of that of a sense of humor of the<br>department<br>photograph and then this uh we made a<br>very happy environment in this one he<br>has been delivered by forceps into his<br>professor and so I come to Jane and her<br>story to finish this lecture for some<br>the simple notion of normal reproduction<br>is seemingly Out Of Reach and this was<br>certainly the case for Jane and Andrew<br>who were referred to our service after<br>Jane had experienced 10 miscarriages and<br>miscarriage is a burden that many women<br>experience but to do it 10 times is<br>devastating beyond belief especially if<br>it occurs in mid pregnancy as was the<br>case with Jane on a number of<br>occasions arguably it is my Specialty's<br>greatest challenge to find a way to help<br>and unfortunately for us there are no<br>books or journals or any learned pathway<br>that we can pick up to find a way to<br>prevent it<br>we need to rely on Instinct and belief<br>but to find a way gives no greater<br>achievement for Jane and Andrew there<br>was a happy outcome and it came about<br>because of the unwavering trust and<br>respect for our service but also the<br>dedication and skill of many people<br>beginning with our high class IVF unit<br>our dedicated Obstetrics and mid midy<br>teams and probably about in fact and<br>above all our fantastic doctors and ver<br>es in the Nal Intensive Care<br>Unit so I want to end by briefly giving<br>Jane's<br>story she had a condition called<br>adenomiosis which means that she has<br>multiple sites of bleeding within the<br>uterus which leads to scaring in the<br>inability for it to grow and function<br>properly in pregnancy to try and<br>overcome this I prescrib six months<br>treatment with a kotr and releasing<br>hormone with the aim of shrinking these<br>bleeding SES and after 6 months of this<br>using IVF to try and get her pregnant<br>quickly we did so and Jane conceived<br>successfully but<br>unexpectedly had a twin pregnancy to<br>manage we had a twin pregnancy to manage<br>something that a great that added a<br>great deal of<br>complexity despite being an inpatient at<br>18 weeks she experienced a major setback<br>and that her first twin Jessica suddenly<br>miscarried Jessica was far too premature<br>to survive and so you you'll appreciate<br>the survival is only possible from about<br>24 weeks and so Jane and Andrew and all<br>her caregivers had at least six weeks of<br>anxiety to reach that milestone for a<br>second Twin to be retained is an<br>unusual uh event and in Queen Mar's for<br>75 years I can only imagine this would<br>have happened only a few times but with<br>a dedicated team effort we got another<br>seven weeks before Jane began to<br>bleed Emma was born uh by emergency Z<br>section with a weight of 730 gr that is<br>1 pound and 10 o and these are some<br>other photos of Emma a ring ring finger<br>arm<br>sorry a ring on her arm um and a and a<br>Andrew Emma never looked back and in<br>this photo uh this is the photo of her<br>this year and I'm very very proud that<br>she is also here in the audience<br>today ladies and gentlemen and Emma<br>those are the three p of Queen Mary Nora<br>you<br>um it made me think of several things<br>first of all I thought that it<br>underestimated your effect on our<br>medical school in terms of teaching and<br>critical appraisal of medicine um both<br>Obstetrics and neology and Pediatrics<br>are full of things that we've actually<br>done wrong um and you've taken a lead<br>part in actually teaching us us and both<br>the staff and the medical students<br>around how to look at evidence and<br>actually decide whether what we're going<br>to do is correct or not I think that's<br>underplayed and I think that's actually<br>been one of the key characteristics of<br>your teaching career which I personally<br>have really appreciated so thank you<br>very much and I want to see that's<br>really so important I believe that uh<br>that we cannot me not not mention it<br>really um the the look at history is<br>important because uh I it brings to mind<br>the aphorism that those who ignore<br>history run the risk of repeating the<br>past um and in fact listening to you um<br>I could could see the repetitions that<br>can occur with history even in the<br>current time uh when there's been issues<br>around the fertility Service uh and how<br>it moves forward and how decisions about<br>a building can actually have<br>consequences some uh 10 15 years later<br>that you regret so I think there is a<br>lot to learn from looking back at<br>history even though we fix our eyes on<br>the future and say what are we going to<br>do uh and how are we going to do things<br>better and I think the critical<br>appraisal leads to one um and looking<br>back at history leads to saying let's<br>not make those sort of mistakes again so<br>thank you very much I think that's been<br>a great lecture um I'm sorry I had to<br>leave at the very beginning you might<br>have wondered what had happened but I'd<br>forgotten something um I suddenly<br>realized that I didn't have a token of<br>appreciation which was sitting in my<br>office so I had to run back to my office<br>uh and get a token of appreciation<br>um which was sitting there for me to<br>forget so um I would really like to you<br>to accept uh this is a token of the um<br>appreciation the university has for what<br>you've done tonight and in the past this<br>is the um I uh something to go up on the<br>wall to remind you of the of the<br>occasion uh and this is a a more useful<br>perhaps token of appreciation that you<br>can spend in any way that you like uh</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
