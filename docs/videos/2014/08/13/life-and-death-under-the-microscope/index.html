Church and it's my pleasure<br>to introduce our seventh Public Health<br>lecture for the year the seventh and<br>last one and we keep the best to last um<br>this year all seven of the public lect<br>have also been inaugural professorial<br>lectures which are Traditions that<br>universities have uh usually shortly<br>after someone being appointed or<br>promoted to Professor giving this<br>lecture about their work so tonight it's<br>my great pleasure to introduce Professor<br>Mark Hampton now Mark did a master of<br>science for University of Canterbury and<br>then did a<br>PhD uh here with Professor Christine<br>winterborn he did post dos at the insk<br>Institute in Sweden and then he went to<br>Harvard in United States and he's been<br>on our staff since<br>1999 and he was uh promoted to professor<br>at the end of last year which officially<br>took effect from the 1st of February<br>this year so it's great pleasure to<br>introduce Mark Hampton who's going to<br>talk about life and death under the<br>microscope<br>mark thank you Peter and um thank you<br>everyone for coming along tonight it's<br>uh quite strange looking out into the<br>audience and seeing a lot of familiar<br>faces but not in this environment that<br>I'd expect to be here in this in this<br>lecture theater um what I want to do<br>over the next hour is give you a brief<br>rapid overview of some of the research<br>projects I've been involved with<br>throughout my career um because of time<br>and some places I'll go quite quickly<br>and um may not explain things very well<br>or may lose a few people but I guess<br>what I want you to get out of the the<br>whole um experience is to go away um<br>thinking or seeing um you know why I<br>wanted to do some of the work that I do<br>and why it's really exciting and and why<br>science is is fun and cool um if that<br>doesn't work for you my son Theo is<br>sitting down here he's brought his iPod<br>if he told me if things get a bit boring<br>so you're welcome to to come and see him<br>I also hope my voice is going to hold<br>out as well I've had a few problems with<br>it for the last week or so but we'll see<br>how that<br>goes okay so I'm a cell biologist I like<br>to study cells and cells are the most<br>fundamental um form of basic unit of<br>life is how they're described life forms<br>can consist of one cell in the case of<br>this amoeba sitting in the pond or it's<br>many cells and for multicellular<br>organisms life gets a lot more<br>complicated than that amoeba um and that<br>they all have to to work together to<br>carry out the function of that<br>particular<br>organism um as an example I put up<br>humans we have something of the order of<br>50 trillion cells that's an estimate<br>it's very hard to measure or count that<br>number um and there are over 200<br>different cell types that very<br>specialized cell types that work<br>together they can't survive by their own<br>on their own they work together to<br>enable us to do all of the things that<br>we do in fact I think it's quite neat to<br>think that these cells can collect<br>themselves together in an organism that<br>is sufficiently uh organized and<br>intelligent to be able to invent a<br>microscope and then look back down at<br>them okay I'm very interested in in in<br>cell death um for that single cell Amia<br>death means end of the organism for<br>multicellular organisms um like ourself<br>it's a very different um situation and<br>in fact cell death is an essential part<br>of of Life as a multi cellan organism um<br>I've put up there that over the next<br>hour about 5 billion cells in your body<br>will actually die um it's not a bad<br>thing so don't worry uh the other<br>interesting thing is they won't just die<br>but they'll initiate this self-destruct<br>mechanism inside them and intentionally<br>kill themselves um for the benefit of of<br>the host I'm going to get on to that<br>process a little bit uh a little bit<br>later on but first I wanted to introduce<br>you to my favorite cell um this is a<br>fosite um or in this case a fiic white<br>blood cell and its job in our body is to<br>hunt down uh invading microbes to ingest<br>them and kill them so you can see on<br>this particular slide this one's reached<br>out an arm for this we green bacterium<br>down there is about to grab and ingest<br>the function of ftic cells was<br>discovered uh by a Russian zoologist Ali<br>mechnikov it's a an artist impression of<br>there sitting looking down his<br>microscope uh the legend has it um and<br>I'm not sure exactly how correct this<br>was uh that he performed this work um in<br>while on holiday with his family in<br>missina which is in Italy on the<br>Mediterranean Coast um and he was<br>interested he looking at these<br>transparent starfish La under his<br>microscope um and you can read his<br>thoughts this comes from his journal<br>here when a new thought suddenly flashed<br>across my brain and he was looking at<br>these mobile cells within the starfish<br>lava and he had this thought that maybe<br>these cells might play a role um in the<br>defense of of organisms against<br>Intruders that point he rushed outside<br>he went to the nearest Rose snapped off<br>a we Thorn came back inside poked that<br>into a starfish and and came back uh a<br>day later to see what had happened and<br>again that's an artist impression down<br>here of the the transparent ly the<br>starfish Thorn there and these mobile<br>cell collecting around um The<br>Thorn I like that story for two reasons<br>um one is that's that sort of Eureka<br>moment that we all have in science<br>probably not the same magnitud or<br>significance as as Mitch aov or Newton<br>and his apple or our comedies in the in<br>the bath but it is it's a great moment<br>and it's the things that keep us going<br>in the lab uh when all else uh yeah<br>dealing with sort of the frustration and<br>some of the more mundane day-to-day<br>things uh the second part I like about<br>this particular thing is that his wife<br>actually let him take his microscope<br>with him on holiday down into the<br>Mediterranean and took the kids out to<br>the circus while he got to have a play<br>with it I think that's that's<br>priceless Okay so so as I said it<br>actually took quite a well for MIT St<br>become more widely accepted um so this<br>he showed this in starfish but then<br>subsequently and a number of other<br>organisms and I like this we movie here<br>off off the internet and this is again<br>now looking at our own blood cells here<br>this is a neutr on a on a glass plate<br>surrounded by some red blood cells and<br>this really illustrates this white blood<br>cell chasing this bacterium across the<br>slide it's following it uh by the<br>chemical signals that are coming from<br>the bacteria itself that's phally<br>sniffing the bacteria pushing aside the<br>red blood cells grabbing that bacterium<br>and<br>swallowing um so this is a more detailed<br>image of a similar process so this is an<br>electron micrograph where he's actually<br>taken a a cross-section through that<br>white blood cell here so this is the<br>cell this is its nucleus here and these<br>are a number of um bacteria that have<br>been ingested<br>so several bacteria here that have been<br>ingested into their neutri inside these<br>fomes so mnov won the Nobel Prize in um<br>1908 for his discovery of this this<br>theory of of<br>fosis and he noted around about the same<br>time is um that that he really didn't<br>know how these things were killing<br>bacteria at all and that was something<br>that he thought was the the next thing<br>that needed to be sorted out that<br>question is actually what I did my PhD<br>on um with Christine Windor and Tony K<br>here in um the<br>laboratory and in fact it's a question<br>that we're still asking in the<br>laboratory today is that a number of the<br>details exactly what's going on haven't<br>been worked out um but what I want to do<br>tonight is to describe one of the<br>mechanisms um and I guess the first<br>answer should be that there are multiple<br>mechanisms and that makes a lot of sense<br>that there are multiple mechanisms if<br>there was just one it could be quite<br>easy for bacteria to be able to come up<br>with a defense mechanism and to be able<br>to come resistant to that there are a<br>number of mechanisms the one that we<br>study most within um our laboratory is<br>focused on the use of electrons to kill<br>the bacteria um so the guy that was<br>standing next to mechnikov when he got<br>his Nobel Prize in Stockholm in in 1908<br>um would have been particularly<br>interested in this this<br>mechanism that guy's name as you would<br>have recognized from the<br>photo um was was rather fit um and I<br>have to admit to this point as being uh<br>having a bit of an obsession with Nobel<br>prizes um to be honest I'd quite like to<br>win one that would be<br>great um but even as a young kid I knew<br>about Rutherford and his his story and<br>what was going on I guess well like all<br>kids I first thing I wanted to be was an<br>o obviously but um as a Weez as medic<br>boy running around fields in in Nelson I<br>realized quite quickly that that was<br>never going to happen um but I did know<br>about the Nobel Prize and I thought this<br>would be really cool and I knew<br>Rutherford was also born in Nelson and<br>that maybe that would give me a bit more<br>of a<br>chance um so ruford as as you well we<br>his concept uh behind the work that he<br>was working on on that particular time<br>was the structure of the atom so what I<br>put up here is a scripture it's an<br>illustration of what was known at the<br>time as Rutherford's atom and that's<br>where you have this Central nucleus<br>we've got protons and neutrons there and<br>these negatively charged electrons are<br>spinning around outside uh the the<br>nucleus so that model was quite one of<br>the early models and it's been updated a<br>lot since then and atoms don't really<br>look like that but for the purposes of<br>the talk this is just about what we need<br>um except to point out that actually uh<br>the electrons in their orits tend to go<br>in pairs and so an atom that has an<br>unpaired electron is known as a free<br>radical when it's unpaired it wasse<br>either wants to get rid of that electron<br>or to grab another one and that can um<br>is involved a number of chemical<br>processes and can also cause problems in<br>biology um and in biology the most<br>significant free radicals that we have<br>are associated with oxygen so oxygen<br>self can take four electrons and end up<br>as water um which is a good thing but if<br>it takes those electrons individually we<br>end up with these other things these<br>these free radicals generated along the<br>way so just having one electron gives<br>you this compound called super oxide it<br>wants to grab another electron to become<br>more stable so it rips it off things and<br>can cause problems um you go through<br>here to hydrogen peroxide which actually<br>not a free radical because it now has<br>two more electrons which are peered up<br>but it still wants to get through to<br>water and can take electrons um off off<br>molecules so let's get back to the the<br>fome um so again this is an electron<br>micrograph uh of a neutr this is a fome<br>here with a bacteria that's either two<br>bacteria or one bacteria that's just um<br>in the process of<br>dividing now if we zoom into that very<br>small space inside the<br>this is where some pretty amazing<br>chemistry goes on um and it's because it<br>is such a small and it's an enclosed<br>space that it's taken um people a long<br>time to work out exactly what's going on<br>there um and also the reason why we<br>don't know exactly today exactly um what<br>is is happening inside that that<br>fome um but what we do know from a<br>number of work over many years including<br>some of the stuff that was done and<br>robry is that free radicals are<br>generated inside that fome so there is<br>an enzyme complex here it's called the<br>nadph oxidase or more simply a yellow<br>box here and that passes electrons one<br>at a time onto oxygen to generate super<br>oxide so you can see the potential here<br>that this these molecules may be causing<br>damage um super oxide gets another<br>molecule actually from reacting with<br>another Super oxide itself so it it<br>takes one and goes back to oxygen um and<br>you get this molecule hydrogen peroxide<br>which you would have heard about um as<br>being a potentially reactive uh compound<br>that's good for turning your hair white<br>if that's what you so desire and there's<br>another but not particularly lethal in<br>the amounts that it's generated inside<br>the fagone uh there's another enzyme<br>here that um Tony Kettle has studied for<br>many years this is the enzyme Milo<br>peroxidase and it can actually take<br>hydrogen peroxide turn it into hyp acid<br>which is the active ingredient of janola<br>so now you can start to see that we have<br>a mechanism a potentially quite potent<br>bactericidal mechanism for getting rid<br>of these<br>bacteria so my Bas my PhD was basically<br>focused in on this very Tini um part of<br>of biology that inside the neutr there<br>and so I was looking at the rates that<br>white blood cells kill bacteria um<br>looking at putting in Inhibitors of this<br>enzyme and this particular enzyme and<br>see what effect it had on on bacteria<br>introducing other Inhibitors or<br>scavengers sticking things onto the<br>surface of the bacteria to get them<br>insight to that fome and really tease<br>out um some of the the pathways going in<br>there as I said it's an unfinished story<br>and some of the questions are still<br>being contined to be asked today uh with<br>within the laboratory it's also a very<br>important question still because this is<br>the critical interface of the immune<br>system and bacteria and there are<br>actually bacteria that do survive here<br>so Tony presented a paper at lunchtime<br>at joural Club about a bacteria called<br>Yia pistus which is what causes the<br>plague that bacteria goes into these<br>fomes quite nicely and survives um to be<br>able to come up with new strategies for<br>targeting those bacteria we really need<br>to know how are they trying to be how's<br>the cell trying to kill them how the<br>bacteria actually overcoming that um and<br>so we can come up with sort of more<br>strategic<br>therapies for measuring bacterial<br>killing uh this give you a rough idea of<br>the essays that I was using you take<br>your white blood cells you add bacteria<br>to them you mix them up for a certain<br>time you take the sample out put it onto<br>an a plate like this and you count how<br>many bacteria are sitting on that plate<br>and then with time that drops down it<br>tells you how fast those bacteria being<br>killed um so it's quite a a simple um<br>essay and in fact would be a very good<br>essay um if you only ever had to look at<br>one of two plates um and fortunately it<br>took me a lot more to do this so this is<br>a photo from a typical week of my PhD at<br>the end of the week after about three<br>experiments the plates that are pulled<br>up at the weekend and I was sitting<br>there this photo is 20 years old um<br>sitting there dotting away each of these<br>bacteria and Counting them and and<br>telling up the numbers so illustrate<br>ation of of some of the tedm associated<br>with science um maybe also an<br>illustration of the passion that that<br>does keep it going and plenty of time to<br>think about the next experiments and<br>plan that as<br>well uh<br>so um a review article came out from my<br>thesis so we got together and wrote that<br>um which I thought was quite nicely<br>titled inside the<br>fagone um I was also thinking at this<br>time at the end of the PHD it was<br>probably time to escape the agoma as<br>well and see what else they was to have<br>a look at so I come back to the sapsis<br>pathway here um so this is the process<br>that really caught my attention this is<br>the self-destruct mechanism um and it<br>gets activated in cells whenever they<br>need to be clear so when they become<br>damaged to or the body no longer wants<br>them the self-destruct pathway gets<br>activated this here is is a normal cell<br>after it's become epito it shrinks it<br>sort of packages itself up in these wee<br>bundles and neighboring cells to<br>actually swallow the TIC cell and clear<br>it away one of the amazing things is<br>that it still keeps its Integrity so it<br>doesn't start leaking things out into<br>the surroundings and and causing damage<br>at all so definitely um a process that I<br>was really interested in in having a<br>look at there were two links though to<br>my actual PhD itself the first relates<br>to the resolution of<br>information um and this is a slide I<br>think it's very similar to the slide um<br>David Murdoch showed a few weeks ago<br>actually this is looking at<br>cross-section of a lung um where there's<br>an infection and all of these cells<br>through here are neutrals that rush into<br>to clear away the bacteria um this is<br>what happens during the<br>infection um and then this is several<br>hours later it shows how effectively<br>those nutrifil have actually been<br>removed um disappear from that side<br>which is really really important<br>actually because obviously bacteria can<br>be a problem but you've got these cells<br>full of all these toxic chemicals that<br>be causing damage so it's ABS you know<br>even more critical that you get rid of<br>them in some<br>way uh the other thing at the time was<br>that it was there were suggestions that<br>free radicals were also involved in<br>driving the eptic process and I've shown<br>here this is the same enzyme that was on<br>the nutrifil for the purpose of killing<br>the bacteria the thing that came through<br>at that point was that this enzyme was<br>actually present on all cells um and<br>you'd have to ask question what was the<br>point of that because a lot of cells<br>don't take up bacteria and they're not<br>generating all these oxidants but all<br>cells have this particular um oxidise<br>here and the other thing was that<br>antioxidants in the system could block<br>this process and I was particularly<br>intrigued by um reports that came out on<br>in certain cancer cells um that were um<br>resistant to undergoing the eposis<br>process that they had elevated levels of<br>of of certain proteins and one of these<br>proteins was thought to be an<br>antioxidant itself and so that's really<br>what um got me interested uh so 1995 I<br>sent off two<br>emails um so one was to a group in the<br>UK who was studying nutrifil in uh<br>information resolution of information I<br>still haven't heard back from those guys<br>yet um but the other email I sent um was<br>to a group in in Stockholm and that was<br>the group that um the only group in the<br>world at that time that was studying the<br>role of free radical<br>in in<br>osis um that group was headed by stener<br>renes and he said yes please come and<br>again I think for someone who was a bit<br>um sort of obsessed with the Nobel Prize<br>um Stockholm was the was the place to go<br>so this image this is not the Carolin<br>Institute for those of you know<br>Stockholm this is the Oldtown<br>Gan uh it's actually taken from the top<br>of City Hall the Tower City Hall uh<br>which is where a lot of the Nobel<br>ceremonies uh go on that's me there<br>inside the building that's where uh the<br>banquet is held every year that where we<br>Podium is where the Nobel awardees get<br>to deliver there after dinner speech so<br>I've I've got<br>close and I'm ready for next<br>time okay so a bit more about the eposis<br>process itself so what we've got here um<br>is some cells uh they're sitting on a<br>plastic dish having a look down on top<br>of them with the microscope an inducer<br>of osis has been added and the idea of<br>this movie is to illustrate so this is a<br>timelapse movie this has been sped up<br>but this is still only over a few<br>minutes that the dramatic morphological<br>events that that go on and I think it<br>illustrates it better than that first<br>one I showed you that the cells<br>basically collapse on themselves and<br>bundle them up uh bundle themselves up<br>cells um here's a movie that was made<br>more recently in fact just over a week<br>ago in OB actually using some more<br>modern equipment um Imaging equipment<br>and also includes um I'll set it going<br>first again um cell sitting on the<br>plate uh also thrown in a compound um<br>that you'll start to see turn red but at<br>this stage you see all of these cells<br>sort of bundling themselves up it's<br>coming off the plate and uh as it looked<br>like in the first movie um<br>not sure how long this is going to go<br>for actually but okay so what's<br>happening is you start to see a bit of<br>red color coming on in the cells now<br>what's actually happening here is these<br>are the enzymes in the cell that are<br>responsible for triggering this heptic<br>pathway so these proteins are called<br>caspases uh they chop up uh regulatory<br>structural proteins with the cell and<br>just look in this region there that you<br>get this red color coming on nicely then<br>all of a sudden bang it's rounded up and<br>um<br>okay<br>so studying eposis at that period um in<br>the sort of mid to late 1990s in<br>Stockholm was was really great because<br>that was really the time that um we<br>started to get an understanding these<br>Cas bases would discovered and all the<br>other processes involved in in apotosis<br>um were being um discovered so that that<br>was quite neat um one of the key<br>findings that came from my work at that<br>particular time so this is actually<br>looking at one of those caspases itself<br>so this is the thing uh there's a we<br>peptide in here it goes in and it gets<br>chopped up and in that previous movie<br>there was a we red tag onto that peptide<br>so when it got chopped the tag would<br>come off that was the red color that you<br>were seeing<br>um but what I showed as part of my work<br>was that there's a portion of these<br>caspases and it's this particular amino<br>acid and the Protein that's shown in<br>yellow showed that it was actually<br>really sensitive to being inactivated by<br>hydrogen peroxide and it was at that<br>point that it made me start thinking<br>about the early studies with the<br>neutrals and how they generate all of<br>these oxidants how could they be<br>undergoing the same sort of process as<br>what happens<br>um uh in in other<br>cells<br>and in that lab I did have the<br>opportunity to uh sort of work with with<br>a PhD student at the time so sort of my<br>first taste of of supervision and was<br>able to start having a look at some of<br>these um processes going on inside<br>neutrals as they were<br>dying and um what we were able to show<br>was that yes the cell death Pathways<br>within the neutral were different to to<br>other cells and I've shown this one here<br>this came a bit later on um back in<br>chish at the time but it's one of the<br>the best illustrations I think certainly<br>the a nice visual illustration of what<br>was happening here and this just to<br>confuse you I've changed the colors here<br>so there are actually three white blood<br>cells on this particular slide so I'll<br>show one two and three there okay you<br>can see that um now the red one has<br>taken up bacteria the bacteria have<br>actually been colored red in this<br>example so we have one neutral that's<br>taken up red ones and here are two<br>alongside it um that haven't eaten<br>anything at all now the green stain now<br>is the caspases okay so here we're<br>looking at neutrals that have uh the<br>caspases starting to come on but the<br>ones that have eaten the bacteria the<br>green has faded a lot so there are no<br>active caspases on in those particular<br>um<br>cells quickly jump to today um<br>and actually at the moment in the lab<br>what we want to go and do what I'd like<br>to be able to do is actually go and<br>reinvestigate some of these cell death<br>Pathways in the neutral again um the<br>reason for that is well one it's still<br>important to know um what's going on and<br>know how they cleared but a number of<br>other death mechanisms have now been<br>shown um and so I was at a a cell death<br>meeting a couple of weeks ago in in the<br>states and eposis got barely mention and<br>there were these other forms of self<br>death that were going on<br>and one in particular I think is<br>potentially what is actually going on in<br>inside the neutri so it would be quite<br>cool to to go back and reinvestigate<br>some of those other other systems<br>there um the other thing that we have<br>been doing in the laboratory as well um<br>is looking more recently is not is sort<br>of the regulatory role that these<br>oxidants may play um so not just having<br>a role inside the fagone for killing<br>bacteria but it's been shown that they<br>get generated elsewhere or or maybe not<br>elsewhere but actually can come out of<br>that fasone and do other things and more<br>recent work in in laboratory again is<br>shown that there are particular proteins<br>involved in the regulation of<br>information that the free radicals the<br>neutrals generate can interact with<br>those proteins and and change the<br>function as well so there's a lot more<br>that we need to know about free radicals<br>and inflammation and it's not all just<br>fasone right so in the second part of<br>the talk I want to leave the neutral um<br>for now and go back and talk uh more<br>generally about cell death Pathways and<br>other cells um tell you about<br>mitochondria and put it in the context<br>of of cancer um and so in this<br>particular one uh this is just something<br>again I've grabbed off the internet and<br>it's illustrating well this is this is a<br>cell here membrane here's a nucleus you<br>won't be able to see it way down here<br>but this is the point where you get Casp<br>activation so there are a number of<br>other processes leading to the point of<br>actually activating these caspases to<br>get the cells to die and you'll be<br>pleased to know I'm not going to take<br>you through any of those the sole reason<br>for putting this slide up is that<br>there's this strange looking thing right<br>here where all of the arrows seem to<br>join to and come out of to link to the<br>caspase<br>activation um and that organal is the<br>mitochondria um so I've told you neutral<br>is my favorite cell the mitochondria is<br>certainly my favorite region or or<br>organel within a cell um this is an<br>artist impression here of a mitochondria<br>two mitochondria inside a cell one<br>intact the other one has been sliced<br>through the middle here um and you can<br>see there are two membranes within this<br>particular<br>mitochondria um so what do these organal<br>do actually before I even show you what<br>they do just to show you actually that<br>was the AR impression in real life it's<br>often not like that these things are<br>actually very Dynamic so they're<br>constantly fusing with each other and<br>butting off and so you get these<br>structures that look like tubal so in<br>green here this is actually a real<br>mitochondrial Network inside<br>cells so what do they do okay so Star<br>Wars fans had an early inkling if they<br>were paying attention during the movies<br>um and so yeah George Lucas nearly got<br>it right so he called them um mitlin not<br>mitochondria um so this microscopic life<br>forms and he said they communicated with<br>the force the real thing is they<br>actually generate the force within the<br>cells so this we Guy Anakin who had a<br>bit of an anger management problem um<br>but he was shown to have 20,000 of these<br>mitochondrian within um this with within<br>each of his C which gave them special<br>powers that 20,000 is actually quite a<br>good ballp um so our cells have they<br>vary in the number of mitochondria they<br>have um but many of them can have 20 or<br>even up to 100,000 mitochondria within<br>them and this is the place where<br>basically our food gets turned into<br>energy um and here's a sugar molecule<br>here glucose which has been straightened<br>out to make it easier to look at um we<br>eat this this all of this process<br>doesn't actually occur in the<br>mitochondria it can occur part the first<br>part occurs outside the second part<br>occurs within the mitochondria itself<br>but essentially these bonds between<br>these carbon atoms get pulled apart um<br>and so the carbon uh sorry the glucose<br>ends up as as carbon dioxide and we get<br>energy um from that now I want to go<br>into a bit more um detail about the<br>process itself because it's well two<br>things it's quite important for what I<br>want to tell you next but I think it's<br>also um really important to actually<br>understand how<br>we generate energy within our body how<br>our our own engine engines work and so<br>illustrate that I've thrown up a couple<br>of systems here um one's the internal<br>combustion engine which many you're<br>going to leave here tonight jump in your<br>cars and drive home um and you've<br>probably got some understanding here so<br>the fuel gets squirted into here into<br>the Piston there's oxygen there as well<br>you we spark causes an explosion uh<br>inside that uh due to the the burning of<br>the fuel it's obviously not gluc go but<br>octane which is a bit longer couple of<br>extra carbons uh that pressure that<br>builds up uh forces that piston which<br>moves the cam shaft is it Anyway the<br>wheels turn around I'm not a mechanic<br>okay um the other system I've shown here<br>another way of generating uh is G<br>generating electricity through a<br>hydroelectric power Dam so we get water<br>building up behind a dam that then flows<br>downhill um again turns this Wii to<br>turbines inside the dam that uh<br>generates electricity which then heads<br>off to a<br>household um<br>so how do we do this uh process how do<br>we convert this to energy and any of<br>these processes similar to what might<br>bodies um the answer is yes and it's<br>actually both of them in some way um and<br>I'll I'll show you the detail shortly um<br>slightly different in the sense that um<br>we do burn that glucose that I showed<br>you using oxygen to turn it into carbon<br>dioxide um which gives quite an<br>explosive energy um but we we don't do<br>it all on one go we sort of do it in<br>small fragments so things don't explode<br>um but we have that process we also do<br>make use of this system here um but it's<br>slightly back to front and that we use<br>um electricity within ourselves to drive<br>D compounds not water but drive um uh<br>hydrogen ions or protons I'll show you<br>shortly up a a gradient and then that<br>gradient comes uh goes back downhill and<br>Spins a Wii turbine with inside our own<br>mitochondria to generate<br>ATP um and so this is a bit more detail<br>of the process so what we've done here<br>is we've zoomed into a mitochondria this<br>is a cross-section of a mitochondria I<br>said it had two membranes this is one<br>membrane here the second one you can't<br>see imagine that's on the top<br>there um at this point so our glucose is<br>being pulled apart so the electrons that<br>were within that bonds that energy have<br>have been moved around this actually an<br>intermediate takes them into here but<br>these electrons get fed into this weak<br>complex and pass through a number of<br>protein complexes all the way down the<br>chain exactly like electricity flows in<br>wire down through here and they end up<br>water<br>um<br>and as the process occurs so as these<br>electrons are are flowing through here<br>what happens is you get these protons<br>get pumped out um and so you form this<br>gradient so you have all of these<br>protons on the outside of this membrane<br>now these protons can't pass through<br>this membrane but there's a certain pump<br>within ourselves where these protons can<br>come back through and actually spin the<br>pump enable it to generate<br>ATP and I have to show this movie here<br>cuz this is actually uh it's a model of<br>of this pump in<br>action and effectively you get the<br>opportunity to see really how your own<br>internal engines are working um so you<br>can't see the protons but they're<br>flowing back down through here that's<br>causing this uh protein complex to be<br>spinning around it has an awkward<br>looking shape here and it's causing<br>movement and these three things coming<br>at here are ADP and it's coming in and<br>pump<br>oops okay last Star Wars One Promise um<br>I put this in here just to illustrate or<br>remind me to tell you that this rate of<br>energy conversion that goes on inside<br>mitochondria is is amazing it's actually<br>10 th000 times the rate of the energy<br>conversion that goes on on inside the<br>Sun itself fortunately they are quite a<br>bit smaller than that<br>though um another way interesting tip<br>but um for you trivia people um is uh<br>you know where did these mitochondria<br>come from and again that was the artist<br>impression they actually look very<br>similar to bacteria and the answer is<br>they actually are bacteria um<br>and so this woman here uh Lynn<br>mulus um proposed this so-called Endo<br>symbion Theory and and this was and so<br>it is a theory because we can't go back<br>in time to work out where this really<br>happened but all the evidence is there<br>is that there were initially ourselves<br>didn't used to have mitochondria and one<br>of these FDIC events exactly like I<br>showed you with a neutral occurred one<br>day where a bacteria a specific type of<br>bacteria was taken up that wasn't<br>actually killed by The Host<br>um cell um and so then those basically<br>two organisms live together the bacteria<br>uh inside the cell generating the energy<br>that the cell needed to become<br>multicellular and do all of those other<br>amazing things that that cells do um was<br>very controversial at the time um but<br>now it's almost widely accepted in the<br>field that this is actually true um so<br>again that's quite something to think<br>about that we're actually an alliance of<br>of two independent life forms that have<br>got to together for for this Mutual<br>benefit uh the other thing is behind<br>every great woman there's a great man<br>and I had to put this in here as well so<br>um Lynn was married to the famous<br>science popularizer Kyle s<br>um and it was his TV series Cosmos in<br>the early 1980s that really hooked me<br>onto onto science and watching this guy<br>on TV and some of the older members of<br>the audience may be able to remember him<br>and some of the the quotes that I've put<br>up there still have the DVD series at<br>home unfortunately the outdated special<br>effects and some of the fashion sense<br>doesn't seem to appeal to my kids or any<br>other kids of today but it' be great if<br>there was you know someone else nowadays<br>that that could take his<br>place okay I've gone off on a tangent<br>sorry about that um but I did warn you I<br>wanted to tell you why I find some of<br>these things<br>interesting um right so back inside the<br>mitochondria those of you are taking<br>close notice might have realized there's<br>a potential for real disaster here and<br>there is a real overlap with what<br>happens in the neutral and this is where<br>we have electrons wandering around um<br>going onto oxygen and the potential to<br>generate rather than to be converted<br>into water but generate these other<br>three radicals um with within the cell<br>and this particular enzyme<br>um that actually operates here where the<br>electrons are fed one on a time one at a<br>time on oxygen give water works really<br>well there is no leakage of free<br>radicals there but off this electron<br>transport chain here as these electrons<br>are flowing through they can jump onto<br>oxygen so it's well known that you do<br>generate super oxide inside all<br>mitochondria and that that can go to<br>form hydrogen peroxide as well and that<br>can be damaging and in fact it's been<br>linked to a number of diseases<br>neurodegenerative diseases especially<br>and also to be associated with<br>aging um that this free radical<br>generation does cause damage um the<br>other key thing for the um purpose of of<br>my talk on why we actually started<br>talking about mitochondria in the first<br>place is actually also the it's the key<br>site where this eptic self-destruct<br>program gets switched on um and so I've<br>just Illustrated this here is this is<br>supposed to be the outer membrane here<br>that when a cell becomes tic a signal<br>goes that forms a por into this membrane<br>and things get leaked out of here a this<br>case it's one of the proteins that's<br>actually involved in shuttling electrons<br>comes out goes into the cell and this is<br>what activates those caspases those<br>things that turn um cells<br>red um and so a very important part of<br>the process and it's also the working<br>hypothesis uh of many is that the free<br>radicals that are generated um during<br>this particular process are involved in<br>the initiation of of osis so again<br>positive example of what of what fre<br>radicals can do within a cell I should<br>probably qualify that positive depending<br>on whether it's good or bad if you want<br>a cell to die so in some situations we<br>don't want cells to die and this<br>happening is going to be a bad thing but<br>in other cases we do want cells to die<br>that's where the cancer story comes into<br>play um and so it's been well recognized<br>now for quite a while is that cancer<br>cells don't die uh when they should they<br>have switched off these um self-destruct<br>mechanisms and so um that and actually<br>enables them to grow in places that they<br>shouldn't be growing where they're<br>getting signals that you shouldn't be<br>here also makes them very hard to treat<br>as well so a lot of the chemotherapy and<br>um radiation treatment is attempting uh<br>well actually activates these<br>self-destruct mechanisms and so if<br>you've got a cancer cell where these<br>have been turned off this obviously<br>makes that quite difficult uh so the<br>idea of a number of people is maybe we<br>can switch back on these self-destruct<br>mechanism encourage cells to die and one<br>of the things that we're looking at is<br>maybe we could Target the antioxidant<br>systems within the mitochondria to get a<br>few more free radicals being generated<br>inside those mitochondria of the cells<br>we want to kill to be able to promote<br>cell death um the important thing here<br>is that we want to be trying to kill<br>cancer cells is there's something<br>different about cancer cells um and this<br>is actually uh there is evidence they<br>are different that pathways are set up<br>quite differently the metabolism is<br>different in a cancer cell um from a<br>normal cell so this is a German<br>biochemist um Auto<br>viberg this is actually a real photo and<br>if there's ever going to be a movie made<br>about this guy I think you could<br>recognize who the actor might be um but<br>this guy's no Mr Bean at all um he's the<br>guy that this the cytochrome oad that I<br>talked to you about he won a Nobel Prize<br>in 1932 he was the guy that discovered<br>the cytochrome oxas the things that the<br>electrons onto oxygen to generate water<br>um within the the mitochondria um<br>themselves and for those of us those of<br>us that get a bit disappointed that no<br>one seems to listen to any of ideas uh<br>this is an interesting timeline here his<br>theory was first so German it was first<br>published in 1956 and no one took any<br>notice of it for 40 or 50 years well<br>after he died um but just in the last<br>four or five years years it's really<br>taken off so there have been last year<br>258 papers actually specifically talking<br>about his effect and it's probably one<br>of the hottest areas in cancer biology<br>now is to looking at metabolism in in<br>cancer<br>cells okay oh and for those of you like<br>me are going to spend a number of weeks<br>this year writing Gran location this is<br>viber's Gran location from 1921 so he<br>wasn't even famous he didn't even have<br>his Nobel Prize at that point uh says I<br>require 10,000<br>them<br>okay um so just to finish my the last<br>sort of sciency slide I had is again<br>just bring this back to some of the<br>things that we doing in the laboratory<br>at the moment with around this<br>mitochondria Ox stress cell death and<br>cancer thing u i put three different<br>things up here on on this particular C<br>slide um so we're really interested in<br>understanding um the antioxidant systems<br>of of mitochondria or effect of of cells<br>in general and and how are they working<br>um to remove the free radicals that that<br>generated within cells uh this is a<br>crystal structure or model sorry of uh<br>my favorite protein this is a peroxy<br>redoxin um its job is it removes<br>hydrogen peroxide that's generated in<br>cells um but it has these really cool<br>structures and I'm showing one here of a<br>donut type shape but these things can<br>stack on each other they can form these<br>into locking rings and one of the things<br>that we're interested in is these things<br>not only seem to be very good at<br>removing peroxides um but also<br>interacting with other proteins in the<br>cell to tell the cell that it's actually<br>under stress that there are more things<br>being generated and give the cell a<br>chance to adapt to that in some way so<br>we're trying to understand how these um<br>proteins work within the cell the other<br>thing we're trying do is looking at<br>cells that are actually dying um<br>undergoing various types of cell death<br>and trying to understand the changes in<br>the free radical generation and the<br>antioxidant Pathways within those<br>particular cells um again trying to<br>understand that um obviously the ideal<br>thing would be compounds that we could<br>use um that could promote stress and<br>promote cell death uh we have a number<br>of projects looking at this particular<br>class of compound these are called isoy<br>Cates these are actually natural<br>occurring um compounds in cruciferous<br>vegetables that are responsible that<br>pungent o and bitter taste of some of<br>these things that um people don't like<br>to eat like the water cres and the<br>broccolis and wasabies um and we've<br>shown that these compounds here are um<br>very good at killing cancer cells even<br>cells that are actually some cells that<br>are resistant to undergoing<br>apotosis<br>um and trying to understand exactly how<br>they they're working and unfortunately<br>you AR able to get enough of these<br>things in your in your diet to be able<br>to use them as a therapeutic but we're<br>trying to understand look at a range of<br>different compounds how they're acting<br>inside cells and maybe we can use them<br>cells okay uh right so just wanted to<br>finish off with a few<br>acknowledgements um and I'm going to<br>start with my family to to start with<br>and obviously I'm very passate about my<br>work um but for me my family is is still<br>number one and and always will be um and<br>so to there dotted up there different<br>things so to my wife um amarie um yeah<br>we've been on a lot of fun Journeys and<br>um both before and after the kids and<br>and faced a lot of faced a few<br>challenges on the way but we make a a<br>great team and we've um got through them<br>all so far so so thank you very much for<br>that and um yeah and I promise never to<br>bring my microscope on a on a<br>holiday thanks also to the bigger<br>extended family um especially my parents<br>who are here tonight for um the<br>unconditional support that they've given<br>me over over many many years and always<br>making me feel like I could um achieve<br>anything if I if I set my mind to<br>it um to my colleagues it's actually<br>been 25 years so there's many of them<br>too many to list actually um but as I<br>said to uh our group members on on<br>Friday night where we had a a Wei<br>function um over those 25 years I've<br>been very fortunate to be able to visit<br>um some nice places with um and nice or<br>good universities in some in some nice<br>towns but even feel even more fortunate<br>to be able to have actually grown up in<br>in this particular um building so um<br>thank you thank you very much for for<br>making the University of too Christ<br>Church um a home for me and something<br>I've always U wanted to return<br>to now I have to do this and zoom in on<br>a few four special people on this<br>particular uh and I don't know when that<br>group photo was it was I'd been here a<br>couple of years I think it's the early<br>1990s and some of you may recognize<br>yourselves there but had to zoom in on<br>for for of course the sole purpose<br>to um<br>illustrate the effects of free radicals<br>in aging<br>maybe no um it's not um<br>so Tony<br>and and Margaret um you guys have always<br>been my scientific Heroes and my heroes<br>full stop and so I've been very proud to<br>walk in in your footsteps and thank you<br>for<br>everything uh Christine um<br>as you know I'm not very good at this<br>sort of thing at the best of times um<br>and actually yeah it's I don't know I<br>think it's hard for anyone to uh you<br>know come up with the right words to to<br>thank someone who's given me the<br>opportunity to actually um do something<br>that um you know spend my life doing<br>something that I that I really love and<br>so yeah thank you doesn't seem to be the<br>the right word or the right words but<br>the only on I can think of at the moment<br>so so thank you very much for<br>that and thank you all for listening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
