here<br>at the University of itago and it is my<br>great pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>Professor Dirk deritter um I am very<br>very happy to see um both staff and<br>students here and also I would like to<br>welcome Dirk's family um and his friends<br>and members of the general public who<br>have come to join us this evening I<br>think what's particularly interesting is<br>that I do have a guest list of people<br>who<br>rsvped um for this particular event and<br>I think it's important for the rest of<br>the audience to know that there are also<br>people in this audience who have<br>actually suffered brain injury for whom<br>this particular appointment uh was<br>particularly uh poignant and I think the<br>last time we had patience um in the<br>audience of An inaugural professor was<br>the lecture that was given by professor<br>John McCall and so I think it reminds us<br>that when we make these kinds of<br>appointments we are not only hiring<br>professors for the University but we are<br>also hiring very very talented<br>clinicians now I often say at these<br>lectures that all professors are special<br>um as they are but each one of them has<br>something that is particularly special<br>about them and I think the thing that is<br>particularly special about tonight<br>uh speaker is that we often refer to him<br>as the people's Professor um because as<br>you know the fact that Dirk is here is a<br>direct reflection of the efforts of<br>people in itago and Southland uh to<br>raise the funds that support this<br>particular chair so no pressure Dirk um<br>but the entire South Island really was<br>behind this particular initiative now I<br>was the vice Chancellor when we started<br>looking for our new professor of<br>neurosurgery and I must say that there<br>are few things that are more daunting uh<br>as a vice Chancellor than trying to<br>appoint a medically qualified academic<br>the only thing more daunting is trying<br>to appoint a<br>neurosurgeon so I was a little concerned<br>about how this was going to work um but<br>from the moment that we met Dirk we knew<br>that he was our choice um for this<br>particular position Not only was he<br>incredibly well qualified uh as both an<br>academic and a clinician he was also an<br>amazing human being as well so I warmly<br>w welcome him to the University of itago<br>I think we are all uh both as a<br>university community and a larger<br>Community incredibly lucky uh that he<br>has chosen to make dened in his home I<br>will now hand over to associate<br>professor Jim Reed who will tell us a<br>little bit more about the academic<br>background of our speaker this<br>evening thank you<br>hen it's my privilege to be able to to<br>introduce uh Durk to the audience<br>tonight um I will just run through some<br>of his curriculum V and talk a little<br>bit about what he is going to say uh<br>Dirk was born in Gent I won't tell you<br>what year um and uh he he was born in<br>Gent in Belgium and if anyone has ever<br>been to gent it's an incredibly<br>beautiful city um so I think uh you're<br>very privileged to have come from there<br>uh his primary education of course was<br>also in Gent but he had a couple of<br>years in the United States in<br>Albuquerque and attended the Santa Fe<br>High School in New Mexico<br>uh I have the privilege of looking at<br>his student record um and it runs just<br>something like this uh I won't tell you<br>the year again but the first year was<br>distinction the second year was<br>distinction the third year was<br>distinction the fourth year was<br>distinction the fifth year was great<br>distinction the sixth year was<br>distinction and and so on until it ended<br>up finally with another great<br>distinction his internship uh was again<br>in uh University Hospital in in in Gent<br>and then he spent a time in Rwanda um as<br>a as an intern there before coming back<br>to train in<br>neurosurgery his training was of course<br>in Belgium but he also spent two years<br>in South Africa in<br>Durban uh he now is the the uh the uh<br>neurological Foundation chair of<br>neurosurgery as as uh Professor hay has<br>said his talk tonight is going to be<br>he's called it to dream is to cure phoms<br>and I'm sure having heard him speak<br>before not on this subject of course but<br>I'm sure it's going to be very<br>interesting he's going to talk about<br>phanthom sound which is called tinitus<br>and Phantom Pain uh and to build a story<br>by stating that in a dream state in<br>which there's there is still<br>Consciousness and you will probably all<br>be aware of this you are sometimes<br>conscious and are dreaming people don't<br>perceive tenus uh and they don't<br>perceive phanthom pain so I'm not going<br>to spend talk about the rest of his<br>lecture I'm going to let him uh tell you<br>that himself so it's with great pleasure<br>that I I would like to introduce to you<br>the neurological Foundation of<br>neurosurgery University of atago denan<br>derill thank you very much good evening<br>everybody um good evening I will um talk<br>to you about<br>dreams everybody who starts needs a<br>dream to live up to hopefully and my<br>research has basically been focusing on<br>Phantoms Phantom perceptions Phantom<br>sound and phantom<br>pain now when you look at the dictionary<br>or Wikipedia you will see that dreams<br>are just succession of images ideas<br>emotions and Sensations that occur and<br>this is important<br>involuntary um in the mind During<br>certain stages of sleep now there is<br>different kinds of dreams dreams and<br>dreams have been explained in different<br>ways you've got the prophetic dreams of<br>which I won't speak the creative dreams<br>which are from an scientific point of<br>view more interesting symbolic dreams uh<br>which I will not uh address either and<br>Visionary dreams which are important for<br>every University and for every<br>academic now actually science or the<br>scientific method was the result of a<br>dream I'm not going back to bacon um but<br>when deart started his uh um describing<br>the scientific method in his book deod<br>what he was actually referring to was<br>what he had dreamed 10 more than 10<br>years before so a dream is what caused<br>scientific method which ultimately<br>resulted in what we do on a daily basis<br>and Gul is probably the most famous<br>story of where a dream influenced<br>science and he dreamed he was dreaming<br>about a snake who was eating his tail<br>and that gave him the idea of the benzan<br>structure and actually afterwards which<br>is also important for science he he<br>mentioned let us learn to dream and then<br>we may perhaps find the truth so dreams<br>are important from a scientific point of<br>view and are important as well to<br>hopefully develop treatments for<br>Phantoms now apart from those creative<br>dreams you've got Visionary dreams and<br>those Visionary dreams probably the most<br>well known is Martin Luther King's dream<br>where he's where he started his uh or<br>halfway his talk he mentioned I have a<br>dream that one day and so on and so<br>forth so where he shows that he has a<br>dream of a new nation and so the<br>Visionary dreams are also important in<br>developing a research plan for the<br>future now those Visionary dreams are<br>old and Alchemists The Alchemist dream<br>was to turn metal into gold where we all<br>think well Alchemy is not science well<br>I'm not so sure about that or it could<br>become science and actually seaborg and<br>who received the Noel prize R in 1951<br>for chemistry uh was capable of turning<br>bismut into gold um after um nuclear<br>Collision experiment where bismo um was<br>collided with neutrons and then actually<br>some gold came off so might be a dream<br>but it has been done um not too long<br>ago so if we can turn bism into gold<br>then there should not be a limit to what<br>we should dream about for trying to<br>treat Phantoms<br>and most good ideas come from the<br>patients the patients tell you what you<br>have to start researching and I had one<br>patient who told me look it's strange<br>whenever I dream and I wake up<br>afterwards I remember that I did not<br>suffer tinitus during my dream so we<br>systematically started asking uh uh<br>patients this question and we were<br>surprised to see that actually almost<br>nobody had tinitus or the Phantom sound<br>percept during um their dream state and<br>then we looked at the literature and and<br>were surprised to find that also Phantom<br>limp pane is rare in the dream state so<br>which means that if we understand the<br>dream state better and if you understand<br>what's different in the brain while<br>you're awake or while you're asleep<br>while you're dreaming or the difference<br>between dreaming and non-d dreaming in<br>um and while you're asleep it might<br>actually help us and try to find a<br>solution for Phantom sound and what is<br>interesting is we've been implanting<br>electrodes in the brain for in in order<br>to attempt to try um to suppress citus<br>is that if you look where we put the<br>electrodes um they at the dorsal lateral<br>prefrontal cortex the anterior singlet<br>the am the amigdala and the parampal<br>gyus which should be good but there is<br>still some missing spots um on these<br>list but it's surprising that all the<br>spots that we targeted which were<br>actually based on um on our concept of<br>what generate tinitus um and this is<br>these are two models um that what we<br>think might be the generators of tinitus<br>do overlap with those differences that<br>you have when you're dreaming in<br>comparison to when you're<br>awake now if we start off by saying we<br>dream then we know our brains created<br>dreams tinitus initially was considered<br>an ear problem and has evolved slowly um<br>to a brain problem where the brain does<br>something with missing information if<br>you have hearing loss but if you really<br>go back fundamentally you can ask why<br>ultimately do we have a<br>brain and if you look at this paint at<br>this drawing from Heckle then there is a<br>story in rodolph ala's book eye of the<br>vortex and rodolph alas is a neurologist<br>at NYU in in New York and also a<br>zoologist he describes a story of the<br>se- skirt the sea skirt is a very<br>interesting little creature in its large<br>Stadium it swims around and it has a<br>Noto cord and a central ganglin<br>basically it has a spinal cord and a<br>kind of a brain a primitive form of<br>brain swims around and at a certain<br>moment it finds a rock and when it finds<br>this rock it just goes and sits on the<br>Rock and it won't<br>move and at that stage as Rula describes<br>in his book it digests its own brain so<br>it gets rid of its nervous system and<br>based on that he proposes that when we<br>start moving around as multicellular<br>creatures that's when we need the brain<br>and we need a brain because when you<br>move around the environment changes a<br>lot more than when you're just sitting<br>at one<br>spot now if you start moving around<br>there is inherent uncertainty in the<br>environment is there a um a dangerous<br>creature behind the corner is there food<br>behind the corner Etc so this change in<br>the environment should be predictable<br>because if it's completely random if<br>there is no way that you could predict<br>there if there is no statistical<br>regularities in the environment you<br>don't need a brain because you won't be<br>able to predict and this is ultimately<br>an adaptation in order to increase our<br>survival so from a practical point of<br>view a brain is only necessary as a<br>prediction machine um which is essential<br>once you start navigating around in the<br>environment it uses the brain uses<br>information from previous experiences so<br>you need a memory in order to be able to<br>predict uh future events and these and<br>information has to mean something to you<br>it has to be related to yourself because<br>if you don't relate anything yourself<br>then it doesn't have any meaning and<br>ultimately the goal is to reduce the<br>inherent uncertainty which is uh um<br>inherently present in the environment<br>and this is of course important for your<br>survival so if you look at these two<br>pictures actually it's important that<br>when you encounter this that you learn<br>something from that that in the future<br>you don't go and swim at the same spot<br>and this is why we have a<br>brain now this is a nice story but do we<br>have any arguments that support this<br>point of view of a brain well it's<br>interesting that if you look at networks<br>in the brain that the network which is<br>involved in self-perception so the<br>network in your brain that tells you I<br>am I am who I am I am uh DK and that is<br>the same as a default mode and the<br>default mode is the mode in your brain<br>that's active when you're just sitting<br>doing nothing really um in the morning<br>when you wake up the first thing that<br>activates is your default mode which<br>seems to be the same thing as your<br>self-perception which makes sense<br>because that means that you're ready to<br>start engaging with the environment and<br>to start processing information that<br>comes from the environment but if you're<br>not doing anything then you don't need a<br>brain because you're the environment<br>will not change so it's important once<br>you start navigating which also means<br>that when you're older don't stay in bed<br>start moving around because otherwise<br>your brain might disappear like the se-<br>skirt<br>so if you if you navigate in the<br>environment then you need to predict<br>what's coming next and and the network<br>that's involved in prediction actually<br>overlaps with the same network that is<br>that controls navigation and that<br>controls the default mode and that the<br>um that is involved in self-perception<br>so there is one network or multiple<br>networks that really overlap so the<br>concept in itself does make sense<br>which means that we have to start<br>looking at the brain in a different way<br>and everybody knows Michelangelo's Peta<br>in Rome and in Belgium we've got the<br>what I call the Belgian Michelangelo Yan<br>fabra he created um a piece of art also<br>called the pi where he's lying on uh<br>Maria's uh lap and Maria does look<br>different and Jesus looks more like on<br>Fab but what is important is that in his<br>hand he holds a brain it's a new way of<br>looking at the brain that's what we need<br>because the old vision of how the brain<br>works was basically you've got external<br>stimuli they come into your brain your<br>brain does something with it and you<br>respond with an autonomic and emotive<br>response now there is an another way of<br>looking at the brain which starts from<br>intention the idea is that you don't do<br>that your brain doesn't do anything<br>except for uh when it's necessary now<br>then your brain starts working when<br>there is a goal when there is an<br>intention and when there is an intention<br>that's when you're going to predict<br>external stimuli if your blood um sodium<br>level changes then that will tell your<br>brain go and look for water in order to<br>try and uh balance that or go go and<br>look for um sodium if that's uh possible<br>and so you will sample the environment<br>for what the intention tells you that<br>you have to do and this and then this<br>what the symptoms that you sample will<br>be compared to what you've predicted<br>that will be in the environment it will<br>be updated in a basian way you will<br>perceive it and then you will get your<br>motor response so on the one the old<br>view is basically your brain is<br>behavioristic relatively passive or<br>perception is passive whereas the other<br>is an active way of perception and it's<br>crucially linked to prediction now the<br>old view actually goes back<br>philosophically to Plato and was<br>christianized by St Augustine and then<br>brought into Neuroscience by the K and<br>so the tradition the neuroscientific<br>tradition actually all the way close to<br>the year 2000 was looking at the brain<br>more or less in this way now there is an<br>old tradition as well which goes back to<br>Aristotle who was Plato's student and he<br>disagreed with almost everything that<br>Plato mentioned as a good student should<br>do and his ideas were christianized by<br>Thomas ainus and are now actually<br>getting into um<br>Neuroscience the active way of of<br>perceiving is probably a little bit like<br>Napoleon's approach to um to politics<br>where he<br>said we we act and then we'll see what<br>comes out of it or which is similar to<br>what William James the famous<br>psychologist said action precedes<br>perception now why would we why would<br>this active perception be important well<br>there's a very simple experiment that<br>was done in the 60s by Gibson where he<br>put eight uh six cookie forms on the<br>hand and passively he just put the<br>cookie form on the hand and<br>statistically while you had about 16%<br>one and six chance that that would be<br>correct and what he saw is that actually<br>only 30% of them were correctly<br>recognized whereas if people were<br>allowed to actively explore the cookie<br>form almost all of them were correctly<br>recognize which means that active<br>exploration yields a better perceptive<br>uh result of what the environment really<br>looks like now you can say that's good<br>for for touch but is there something<br>else well if we go back to Aristotle<br>Aristotle already said that vision is<br>actually nothing more than visual<br>palpation just like you're allowed to<br>touch the Cookie forms Vision does the<br>same thing and in the 60s yarus did an<br>experiment with the the beautiful statue<br>of Nefertiti where he showed that when<br>you look at the Statue you're actually<br>exploring it actively with eye movements<br>which is interesting because if your eye<br>if something is not moving in the<br>environment it's fixed after 80<br>milliseconds you won't see it anymore<br>because you will habituate except if the<br>environment doesn't move your eyes will<br>move and so the movement of your eyes<br>will compensate for the lack of movement<br>in the environment and you will be able<br>to see it even though it doesn't move so<br>we predict because there is a change<br>going on in the environment and in order<br>to predict the brain uses information<br>which is stored in memory to imagine and<br>simulate and uh what might<br>uh come<br>next so from that point of view what we<br>perceive is not what is there it is what<br>is constructed determined by your<br>previous experiences and based on the<br>expectations that you have what you're<br>going to see which fits with the the<br>philosophy of Maru ponti and actually<br>already in the 40s there was a um<br>experiment which was done by Bruner and<br>Postman where you just have to look at<br>uh cards that are being shown and then<br>um just say whether these cards are<br>normal or whether there is something<br>wrong with what you see and so when you<br>look at these cards you can play it<br>slowly or fast and for some people you<br>can play it extremely slowly and they<br>say y all looks fine other people you<br>play it fast and they will see it so<br>I'll play it once more<br>but what what is what the diff What<br>should be seen by some people is that<br>some of the the colors of the cards are<br>wrong so and if like this one so if the<br>color is wrong most of the people<br>actually don't see that and there is<br>another experiment which has been done<br>more recently and that is if you look at<br>this text most people will be able to<br>read it now if you passively perceive it<br>you won't be able to make out of<br>anything out of it if you're actively<br>going to predict based on what you<br>expect to read then that will allow you<br>to understand what is there which is<br>interesting from a philosophical point<br>of view because it means that the wrong<br>information is better than no<br>information which also means if you go<br>philosophically one step further that<br>like n said the truth is actually<br>nothing more than an invention of fixed<br>conventions for merely practical<br>purposes or in the way of Shiller the<br>truth is that what works so our brain<br>doesn't really care whether something is<br>true or not as long as it's workable as<br>long as it can have the information to<br>use for the next step to go that is<br>important which also might be linked to<br>Phantom percepts no ponti he built his<br>whole philosophy about that and he said<br>well an object of perception cannot be<br>seen in isolation because it's embedded<br>in a context and it's and it's the<br>context which gives it meaning for<br>example if you look at these two little<br>red dots actually this dot looks bigger<br>than this dot even though they're<br>equally big but the context the<br>environment is different so the small<br>dots make this look bigger which is<br>important because you can have the same<br>experiment which has been done where<br>somebody who um uses a cold object and<br>touches in in a very cold environment<br>the person and that is felt as<br>unpleasant whereas a hot object in this<br>uh in the same environment is is felt as<br>pleasant and the opposite when you're in<br>a in a warm environment coolness is um<br>pleasurable even though it's the same<br>kind of stimulus it's just the context<br>that changes and of course you can also<br>have that in other circumstances for<br>example some people enjoy pain when they<br>in a very specific cont context but if<br>they hit their finger with a hammer a<br>different context they won't find that<br>pleasurable at<br>all now a brain has evolved throughout<br>history and now we have an astonishing<br>amount of brain cells actually we've got<br>about 23 billion um neurons for men and<br>19 million for women which is four<br>billion cells different so even though<br>men have four billion more cells the IQ<br>is the<br>same which might be interesting but it<br>also means that there is something else<br>that has to encode intelligence it means<br>that and the other thing that might be<br>important is actually the connections<br>how these cells are connected to each<br>other and this is for another reason<br>important because we lose a certain<br>amount of cells during our lifetime and<br>if we don't compensate by making more<br>connections well probably after the end<br>of the lecture you would be not as<br>intelligent as before the<br>lecture so the this means that we also<br>have to look at the brain in a different<br>way and an important way of looking at<br>brains from this point of view is that<br>we look at connections rather than just<br>areas that are activated and you can<br>look at the structure the highways that<br>are present in in the brain and for<br>example here you see um most of the<br>streets if you want to call it like that<br>in our brain and on the top you just see<br>the highways that our brain uses and we<br>can use this information um if we do<br>surgery so we can try and not damage<br>uh at least the highways in the brain<br>now apart from the structure there is<br>also functional connectivity and that<br>looks at how parts of the brain work<br>together or work in opposition and um<br>this is genetically encoded for and<br>changes constantly for example on the<br>top you see the functional connectivity<br>here when you do a task for the first<br>time and the same task done three times<br>will already reduced dramatically the<br>amount of brain areas that are involved<br>in the same task and then the last last<br>kind of connectivity is effective con<br>connectivity which looks at from where<br>to where does the information flow um so<br>it doesn't look at only at which areas<br>are involved but from where to where<br>does the information flow so we have to<br>start looking at the brain from this<br>point of<br>view<br>now there is an interesting story where<br>um Thomas malus who was an economist<br>wrote a book and both Wallace and Darwin<br>when they read it they invented the<br>natural the theory of natural selection<br>so they base their theory on economy<br>which is somewhat strange except if you<br>approach it from um complex adaptive<br>systems and complex adaptive systems or<br>any system economy internet the brain<br>that is fulfills two criteria one is<br>that the structure has a small world<br>topology and the other one is the<br>present of noise and noise can be seen<br>as variability a form of<br>uncertainty so and the brain is is a<br>scale-free hierarchical network which<br>which has a small world topology<br>basically what it means is you've got<br>two extremes on the one extreme you've<br>got a completely random brain where<br>every part of the brain is randomly<br>connected to any other part which is<br>probably not very efficient because you<br>don't know what's going to happen next<br>The Other Extreme is where it's where<br>the where the brain is built in a very<br>regular way like a computer and it can't<br>adapt which is also not very good<br>because if you always do the same thing<br>on the same situation you become<br>extremely predictable and you won't<br>survive for a long time so the brain<br>needs a structure and a function in<br>between both and that's where the small<br>world topology comes in and that is<br>especially important if you want to<br>adjust to changes in the environment now<br>the environment itself has a structure<br>of pink noise which is not in itself<br>that important but what is interesting<br>is that the brain actually has developed<br>a struct function um which follows those<br>same statistical regularities it also<br>functions with a structure with a<br>function of a pink noise so and that<br>pink noise is actually what allows you<br>to um to permit variability because if<br>it's completely random it would be white<br>noise so this structure would have white<br>noise and this structure would have no<br>noise because everything is regularly<br>predicted so brain can be considered a<br>complex adaptive system because it<br>fulfills the two criteria<br>now apart from the fact that complex<br>adaptive systems are complex which is<br>what the word stands for an Adaptive<br>which means that they are can adjust to<br>the environment they are also<br>characterized by self-organization<br>meaning that there is no little<br>homunculus sitting somewhere there who<br>orchestrates everything that there is<br>self-similarity which means that what<br>what um happens in a single cell<br>actually also can be similar to what<br>happens in multiple cells and actually<br>even at the brain level and then the<br>most important one for the talk today is<br>emergence which means that the the whole<br>is more than the sum of the components<br>for example if you look at this this is<br>this is not a car this is just a group<br>of parts of a car now it only becomes a<br>car if all those pieces are put together<br>in a very specific way and then it<br>becomes a car and emergence arises when<br>um you connect parts for example parts<br>of the brain in a very specific way you<br>you just can't throw all the brain cells<br>together and say now we've got a brain<br>it doesn't mean anything so what is<br>important is that every different<br>structure can have a different emergent<br>characteristic so if you have one<br>structure of of cells in the brain that<br>are connected in one way you might feel<br>pain now connected in a different way<br>then you've got another emerging<br>characteristic which could be the<br>non-painful state which is similar to<br>the game that children play the<br>Transformer game where with the same<br>building blocks you can get two<br>completely emerging characteristics so<br>which also means that you don't only<br>look at brain activity differences when<br>you look at different emerging<br>properties but sometimes it's just a<br>different connectivity and then when you<br>do an fmri scan a classical fmri scan<br>where you look at changes in bold signal<br>in activity you don't have to see a<br>difference for um a different emerging<br>property to<br>arise now on the one hand we know the<br>brain is mod there's certain parts of<br>the brain that um are involved in<br>certain functions so this part of the<br>brain is involved in hearing this part<br>is the motor area the Sentry area the<br>visual area and so on on the other hand<br>I was I've been talking about networks<br>and the networks and so how does that<br>come together well if you've got<br>different parts of the brain different<br>modules that are they they need to be<br>connected because when you look at me<br>you hear me you see me all at the same<br>time so this part of the brain that<br>hears me and the other that sees me have<br>to be have to create a unified picture<br>now it is estimated it's not 100% sure<br>but one of the most um adapted ideas is<br>that those different parts of the brain<br>that they work together at high<br>frequencies which could be beta or gamma<br>going from 20 uh actually from 13 all<br>the way to 80 or 90 Herz and that those<br>modules are connected by by low<br>frequencies which could be Delta Theta<br>or Alpha activity now how does it<br>connect them well probably by nesting<br>which means that you've got a low<br>frequency just like a carrier wave on a<br>radio and on top of that carrier wave<br>the information is put in higher<br>frequency which could be beta and gamma<br>so then you get something like the<br>images um below here where this is the<br>carrier wave that's the radio station<br>you you zoom into when you want to<br>listen to certain music and the<br>information or the music itself is<br>embedded in the higher frequencies and<br>we it's important and we'll get back to<br>that later now these networks are not<br>all separate and you can't separate them<br>all for example if you look at a<br>hippocampus which is involved in in<br>storing things into memory um and you<br>you've got a certain Network which is<br>here in red that will represent Luke<br>Skywalker now another network will<br>represent what's he called yo<br>Yoda and what is interesting is that<br>Yoda is represented by two cells that<br>are similar to Luke Skywalker and when<br>you have Dart fader he has Network and<br>he also has two cells that are linked to<br>the other so those networks are actually<br>overlapping now and you find the same<br>thing in um in at in a self- similar way<br>in the brain so for example if you look<br>at tinitus well people will say I hear a<br>sound in my right ear it's a pure tone<br>it it uh it affects my my mood it's very<br>distressing um and so on and so forth<br>well all these different characteristics<br>are represented most likely by different<br>Pathways which are actually running at<br>different frequencies just like your<br>radio station which is good for a<br>neurosur surgeon because it means that<br>if you're going to Target an area for<br>example here at the parahippocampal area<br>that you can try to be very frequency<br>specific and not create Collateral<br>Damage by influencing the other networks<br>so at least theoretically it allows you<br>to be very specific which is important<br>if you want to modulate a specific<br>network of the<br>brain now complex adaptive systems are<br>often open which just means that they<br>that they react with or interact with<br>the environment and of course with our<br>brain predominantly interacts with is<br>information that comes from the<br>environment and that's where um where<br>uncertainty is important because<br>ultimately We've Got Brains to reduce<br>the inherent uncertainty in the<br>environment and the uncertainty not is<br>here not defined as in the quantum<br>mechanical uncertainty it's defined as<br>where uh a representation of the world<br>cannot be adapted as a guide uh for<br>subsequent Behavior or emotion or<br>cognition so basically it just means<br>there is not enough I I have not enough<br>information to take on the next step<br>well if you don't have enough<br>information there's two ways in trying<br>to solve it you can get more information<br>either from the environment and if the<br>environment can't give it because you<br>for example auditory information can't<br>uh gain access to your brain because<br>you're deaf for example then there is<br>only one other solution is you go to<br>memory to what is lost stored in<br>memory now information is not is not<br>easily um understood because information<br>from an information Theory point of view<br>has two characteristics one is the<br>information content what we what our<br>brain is interested in and the other is<br>redundancy now the information content<br>is that which reduces the uncertainty<br>that's what what our our brains is re<br>really interested in and the redundancy<br>is actually very important because it<br>allows you to make mistakes and still<br>get enough information to go on to the<br>subsequent um activity so for example if<br>you look at this<br>sentence it's exactly the same as the<br>full sentence here but you can leave out<br>10 letters in this part and you will<br>still understand the information content<br>whereas you if you leave out three<br>letters you will not be able to<br>understand the message so we need this<br>redundancy in order to be able to<br>survive so from a practical point of<br>view if you look at these MRI scans this<br>patient had a had a had a stroke in the<br>brain stem and is in coma but it's<br>unilateral which means that after 7 to<br>10 days the patient will wake up because<br>there is a redundant system on the other<br>side that allows the patient to wake up<br>whereas on the other one here where you<br>see the two little blue dots even though<br>it's very small these uh um these are<br>very symmetrical very small leion this<br>patient will never wake up from coma<br>because the Redundant system is also<br>being<br>involved now information itself is<br>neither matter nor energy it needs<br>matter for embodiment it needs a brain<br>uh or a computer and it needs energy for<br>communication if I don't get any energy<br>I won't be able to talk the computer<br>doesn't get any energy won't be able to<br>function as well information has been<br>called different things that has been<br>call the spirit the ghost in the machine<br>and so on and so forth but if we go back<br>to Plato and Aristotle because that's<br>where we started with as philosophers<br>actually the way they look at<br>information it just says you put a form<br>onto something and and for Plato there<br>was an absolute form and whatever we saw<br>was kind of a copy of it so you had the<br>absolute model of a dog and every dog<br>was just uh A variation of that team<br>whereas Aristotle like you didn't agree<br>he said no the form is actually the the<br>essential properties of a thing which<br>fits a little bit better with our idea<br>that the form is actually the structure<br>in in a brain Network so and then if you<br>look at that from that point of view<br>then Randomness is just a lack of form a<br>lack of pattern in the<br>environment now if we go one step<br>further and we go to thermod Dynamics<br>then there is a second law of<br>thermodynamic that says that everything<br>goes to more chaos or or more disorder<br>now an entropy can be seen as a measure<br>of disorder and if you look at it from<br>an information point of you you can look<br>at it from uh Missing information so<br>there is a lack of structure in in the<br>input so bringing this to complex<br>adaptive systems that means why would do<br>we need this energy why we need this<br>energy for the brain to counter the the<br>the disintegration of structural<br>networks in our brain and this is done<br>predominantly by actions of interactions<br>of cells that are close together which<br>are nonlinear which means that you can<br>it can increase in the beginning and<br>then decrease for example at the end and<br>it has a history which means just there<br>is memory which allows you to make<br>predictions so if we put that together<br>in a model of of what a brain does then<br>what the brain does is it uses free<br>energy it uses energy just glucose that<br>it has and oxygen and in a in a kind of<br>a random Network it uses this energy to<br>create a transient structure with an<br>emergent property and that emergent<br>property can be pain that emergy<br>property can be tenous now it does so by<br>and it this structure is formed by the<br>input of information which come from the<br>environment which ultimately reduces<br>uncertainty into Transit certainty I've<br>got a certain uh percept I perceive<br>something so this is uh means that Trent<br>I have less uh uncertainty now because<br>of the second law of Thermodynamics that<br>disappears and the the transient<br>structure disappears and with it the<br>percept which is good because if it<br>wouldn't exist we would only be able to<br>have one percept in our own lives and<br>that was it so the fact that it reduces<br>actually allows us for example also to<br>build scanners because scanners are<br>ultimately looking at this up and down<br>uh going of the<br>energy now the because the structure<br>disappears The Trent structure with its<br>emerging property disappears also the<br>transient uncertainty reduction<br>disappears and you have to go and get<br>starting all over again and this<br>starting all over again is for example<br>what the fmri uses in its bold response<br>so we get a transient structure that<br>disappears and this transient structure<br>is related to a percept which reduces<br>the<br>uncertainty now the prediction is<br>updated in a basian way this is not that<br>important for now but the concept will<br>come back once we talk about dreams so<br>the information is linked to what is<br>predicted or the prior or or the prior<br>belief and this is then updated with<br>support of what you're sampling in the<br>environment to support your prediction<br>and that will lead to the perception so<br>perception is basically a<br>prediction um associated with the<br>support that you get in the environment<br>for what you predicted which means as<br>rolina said that our default state is<br>actually the dream state and we just<br>update it um by what we what we find in<br>the environment and then what is next is<br>that when it's updated the posterior<br>belief or the percept actually then<br>becomes the new prediction of the next<br>cycle and that is why if you've never<br>seen this picture what will you will<br>have difficulty in recognizing a Delian<br>dock whereas if you've always only seen<br>it once it for for those people it will<br>be the prediction and you will recognize<br>it<br>immediately now if you want to use this<br>theory for practical purposes as<br>neurosurgeon or a neurologist or<br>somebody interested in in Neuroscience<br>then we have to know how how can we get<br>to these predictions and there is some<br>interesting work done by arnal in France<br>where He suggests that the prediction<br>itself is encoded with a specific<br>oscillation frequency which is the beta<br>frequency and the prediction error which<br>is what you want to update is actually a<br>combination of beta and gamma and that's<br>interesting because these are very<br>strong predictions which we can use in<br>order to see if this is correct and so<br>if we look for example at 153 tenus<br>patients and<br>264 people without tenius then we can<br>look what is statistically different and<br>by that we can look at whether they<br>indeed have a a beta and a gamma<br>correlation or not which which is what<br>you will see in the in the green circles<br>or you can do it even more you can look<br>at different brain areas that we know<br>that are involved in tinitus and then<br>specifically look uh in the green<br>circles at those areas where you find<br>this beta and gamma which says that tin<br>is actually a prediction error the brain<br>says well I've always heard let's say<br>4,000 Herz you go to a disco and you<br>damage your ear you you lose hearing at<br>4,000 Hertz your brain says well I've<br>always had 4,000 htz coming in<br>prediction is there should be 4,000 HZ<br>there is a large prediction error which<br>should be encoded which should be visual<br>uh which we should be able to visualize<br>by looking at these frequencies and<br>that's what you're seeing here in this<br>um in this<br>slide<br>so why do we then develop these Phantom<br>percepts well for an easy reason because<br>as I mentioned before the brain can<br>cannot stand one thing that's a lack of<br>information because if it doesn't have<br>any information it goes and looks for<br>information and if there is not enough<br>it'll go to memory so when there is<br>sensory deafferentation when your hand<br>is amputated or your your hearing is<br>gone then basically you can't fill in<br>this missing information because it's<br>not just there so your brain go back to<br>memory and pull out of memory the last<br>stored um feature and that's going to be<br>the phantom pain like Captain aab and<br>mob's uh talk uh sorry book or Phantom<br>sound as um bethoven suffered when he<br>when he turned de but but that is just<br>when there is a deafferentation of<br>sensory system hearing loss uh<br>amputation but if you deaf yourself as a<br>human being entirely from the<br>surrounding you will perceive something<br>which is not there and it might be<br>another being which could be God or<br>Allah or yahwe depending on your<br>cultural background but that's not that<br>important what is interesting if you now<br>talk about dreams then you DEA yourself<br>from from the environment but there is<br>no updating possible there is absolutely<br>no updating because your sensory systems<br>are down um and and dream state and so<br>what you will do is you will generate a<br>self in an environment which is not<br>updated so you'll just float from one um<br>experience to the other experience so<br>which is as I mentioned before the idea<br>of rol is that actually our normal<br>default state is the dream state and<br>when we are awake we just adjust the<br>dream state to the<br>environment so if this is correct When<br>We're Dreaming actually we don't get<br>this Basin updating we don't get this<br>correction of the prediction so a dream<br>is a prediction without support of the<br>stimulus and in a dream state there is<br>no tins or no phantom pain so can we use<br>that in treatment well yes you can you<br>can try to remove the prediction all<br>together and there is a recent<br>experiment uh where they removed part of<br>the cerebellum the parlus and animals<br>who had tenus and their tenus their<br>behaviorally disappeared or when they<br>were um exposed to a loud sound they did<br>not developed tenus so<br>probably or potentially one of the<br>hypothesis is that actually you just<br>remove the prediction and if you remove<br>the prediction there won't be a<br>prediction error and if there's no<br>prediction error there won't be ten<br>there won't be phantom pain or you can<br>remove the updating of the prediction<br>error which is what I'm predominantly<br>interested in or you can provide false<br>support so you can try to trick the<br>brain and say well well your prediction<br>is there should be for example two legs<br>and an amputated person like here and<br>then you trick the brain by looking at<br>at at a mirror where you see a fake leg<br>which is not there and the phantom pain<br>in about 50 to 60% of the patient<br>disappears so you can trick the brain in<br>believing that there is um supporting<br>evidence for the prediction But<br>ultimately what we need is we need a<br>better understanding of this basian<br>network in the brain and this is what<br>I'm looking<br>I'm hoping that's the dream that's the<br>Visionary dream of me here in um in New<br>Zealand is hoping to unravel the system<br>because if we unravel the system we will<br>be able to treat Phantoms a lot better<br>so in conclusion tinitus is not only an<br>ear<br>problem it's probably generated more<br>centrally and sometimes it can be<br>managed by controlling the brain if we<br>understand it well<br>enough and as we started Martin Luther<br>King said I have a dream one day that<br>according to n they will wake up and<br>take note that their ears were dreaming<br>so as a last slide I think the best way<br>to get started is to quit talking and to<br>start doing something and I thank you<br>for your<br>attention thank you um my name is John<br>Mcall and I'm standing in tonight for<br>Professor Andre vanro who's overseas and<br>it's my pleasure on behalf of the<br>Department of surgical Sciences to thank<br>you for your lecture<br>tonight um according to one of the<br>slides you showed I've lost 85,000<br>neurons during your lecture so I'm very<br>glad that I brought my<br>notes um Professor Reed has already told<br>us something about durk's background and<br>of course we count ourselves as being<br>tremendously lucky to have attracted a<br>person of Dirk's caliber to Denon to be<br>the academic head of the first and at<br>this point in time at least the only<br>academic Neurosurgical unit in New<br>Zealand and now that those of you who<br>haven't heard Dirk uh speak before have<br>now had a firsthand glimpse into some of<br>his work and some of his<br>thinking and one of the things that uh<br>his lecture illustrates to me and I have<br>had the chance to to hear Dirk talk<br>before on several occasions is that Durk<br>is not just a neurosurgeon but he's also<br>a<br>neuroscientist it's a very common<br>conception I think that um surgeons in<br>particular are people who do things they<br>doers and of course doing things uh is<br>essential to the art of<br>surgery um but I think what Durk<br>epitomizes and we saw this in his<br>lecture that the role of the academic<br>surgeon is much more than this is also<br>to think and to communicate and to<br>enhance understanding and I think that<br>we saw all of those characteristics<br>demonstrated<br>tonight and you'll also note from the<br>the content of the lecture and if you go<br>to the uh denan School of medicine's uh<br>website and look up uh durk's research<br>profile um you'll see that he's not at<br>all constrained by traditional surgical<br>boundaries his research draws on many<br>other disciplines including pain<br>medicine neurology Psychiatry psychology<br>and even philosophy and<br>religion and tonight what we heard about<br>was a work that explores the way we<br>perceive<br>ourselves and also the way uh in which<br>the the world uh we perceive the world<br>around us and what happens when those<br>perceptions become distorted or<br>disordered and how they affect our<br>quality of life and our ability to<br>function as human<br>beings now importantly from a<br>therapeutic point of view uh we also<br>heard about how those distorted<br>perceptions may be modulated so that we<br>can restore equilibrium and enable us to<br>function<br>better um and uh I found that some of<br>the stuff actually I had trouble<br>following and um um and I look forward<br>to actually hearing you again for a<br>third or a fourth time Dirk so that I<br>can pick up the thread of U of some of<br>these exciting<br>Concepts but in particular I was drawn<br>to the idea of the duality of dreams and<br>on the one hand uh Derk you spoke about<br>uh dreams and aspirational terms and<br>cited a well-known example of Martin<br>Luther King and um knowing a little bit<br>about what you were talking about<br>tonight I thought of a much more prosaic<br>and immediate um aspiration that could<br>be closer to home and probably close to<br>the Bone the dream of winning back the<br>America's<br>Cup and I think that Grant Dalton and<br>Dean Barker will be feeling more than<br>phantom pain if they don't pull<br>tomorrow<br>um Duke you also spoke of harnessing the<br>dream state as a therapeutic tool um and<br>uh perhaps this isn't a New Concept and<br>I'm sure that the the the founders of<br>psychoanalysis Sigman Freud and Carl<br>Jong and others had similar precepts but<br>I think that they would have been blown<br>away by your explanations of the<br>neurobiological mechanisms that we heard<br>about<br>tonight you also talked about the<br>Visionary aspect of dreams and um<br>tonight um also represents the<br>realization of another vision and that<br>is the retention of Neurosurgical<br>services in atago and Southland and uh<br>Professor Hayne also touched on this and<br>I think it's worth reflecting on the<br>reasons that that's come about and it<br>came about really because the District<br>Health Board and the university and the<br>community all stood together and they<br>spoke with one voice um uh with unity<br>and so I think that neurosurgery can be<br>an Exemplar of what we can achieve uh if<br>we have a Unity of<br>purpose now there were many people<br>involved in this the neurosurgery<br>campaign and I just want to divert to<br>mention two names many of those people<br>will be here tonight one is Brigadier<br>Brian mcmah who carried who chaired the<br>fundraising committee for the<br>neurological Foundation chair of<br>neurosurgery and that's the chair that<br>Professor Dara has been appointed to so<br>it seems fitting to acknowledge Brian<br>tonight and the other person is uh Sam<br>bashara uh whose absolute dedication<br>over a long period both before and long<br>after his official retirement kept the<br>deden however tonight uh belongs to<br>Professor Dirk Dara and Durk we are<br>absolutely delighted to have you here in<br>denen I want to congratulate you on a<br>wonderful lecture and I'd also like you<br>to accept this token on behalf of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
