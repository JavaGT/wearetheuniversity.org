Lecture.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>atago good evening on behalf of the<br>University of itago I would like to<br>warmly welcome you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture I would like to<br>extend the welcome to both the staff and<br>the students of the University of atago<br>and also members of the general public<br>um who so religiously attend these<br>inaugural professorial lectures as part<br>of their ongoing continuing<br>education as a group um we are all<br>collectively here to support Julian<br>because we realize what a significant<br>achievement it is to be promoted to the<br>rank of professor at the University of<br>itago Julian's research and teaching<br>here um at atago is actually a very<br>cogent reminder to all of us that the<br>work that we do here is not only<br>important um but it is also<br>useful and like some of the work that we<br>will here about tonight um Julian's work<br>actually addresses some of the major<br>challenges that we will face in the 21st<br>century long before the current emphasis<br>um on green energy became very very<br>popular um scientists have long been on<br>a quest to mimic the way in which plants<br>convert sunlight into fuel in leaves as<br>I think we will probably hear tonight<br>photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide<br>and water into oxygen and carbohydrates<br>such as glucose and the remarkable thing<br>about this process is that the en energy<br>transfer efficiency um is well over<br>95% so the production of hydrogen using<br>nothing but water and sunlight offers<br>the possibility of an abundant renewable<br>green source of energy for the<br>future now one of the major his uh<br>hurdles to solve in the mystery of how<br>plants manage to break apart molecules<br>while not simultaneously breaking<br>themselves apart um has been one of the<br>rate limiting steps in our ability to<br>use uh the processes of photosynthesis<br>and apply them to renewable green energy<br>and this is actually the mystery that<br>some of Julian Eaton ry's um research<br>intends to solve so today we have the<br>great pleasure of learning more about<br>his groundbreaking research on Photo<br>system 2 and I would now like to hand<br>over to Professor Frank Griffin who's<br>going to tell us a little bit about<br>Julian's uh journey to<br>uh<br>Kiora uh distinguished academics and<br>friends i' I've written down details<br>here because many of the words are very<br>big and I will either forget them or<br>mispronounce them so I will stick to a<br>disciplin invitation to Julian to give<br>his inaugural lecture it's my privilege<br>this evening to introduce Julian Eaton<br>Ry and to provide some background<br>information that sometimes not even<br>found in CVS<br>uh to um obviously see the road he's<br>traveled to become professor of Taro<br>Julian's early academic Journey didn't<br>always trans transverse the conventional<br>academic Pathways so it's worthy of note<br>and I think it also provides a Beacon of<br>Hope for<br>parents it began with him completing his<br>Secondary School CSE subjects in the UK<br>some 40 years ago he then spent some<br>time as an auxiliary nurse in a disabled<br>serviceman's home before damaging his<br>back lifting one of the patients this<br>provoked him to continue his education<br>and culminated in completing his<br>secondary qualifications in<br>1977 he then carried out basic training<br>in the<br>army with the unfulfilled Prospect of<br>becoming a<br>physiotherapist uh he having having been<br>frustrated in that uh Prospect he<br>decided to circumnavigate the medical<br>school and go to the Department of<br>Botany where he in fact carried out his<br>undergraduate studies uh from<br>1978 and he graduated with honors BSC<br>botany in<br>1981 and during that period he also had<br>annual visits as a camp leader in the<br>United States and this obviously made a<br>deep impression on him because having<br>completed his BSC in Manchester he<br>decided to immediately go to Illinois to<br>carry out his PhD studies which he<br>carried out and completed a PhD in<br>botany at the University of Illinois in<br>1987 two-year postgraduate fellowships<br>were then held in Japan and they were<br>followed by 2-year periods as a<br>researcher and Senior researcher at<br>Arizona State University and Brook Haven<br>National Laboratory New York his postdoc<br>experience allowed something important<br>to happen it allowed him to transition<br>from Plants to the really important<br>living cells the<br>microorganisms and he was introduced to<br>cyanobacteria the fathers of all<br>biological systems and<br>mothers and uh obviously these are very<br>important organisms because oxygenic cob<br>bacteria are pivotal to Life as we know<br>it for without them we would be no more<br>than undifferentiated slime wallowing in<br>an anoxic primeval<br>swamp rather than being professors here<br>atago so we have a lot to thanks sign of<br>bacteria for Julian was appointed<br>lecturer in the department of<br>biochemistry in 1964 and since then he's<br>progressed senior lectur uh associate<br>professor to currently professor in sort<br>of Kenan kenal<br>movements and he has been especially<br>involved in sustaining and developed the<br>area of plant biotechnology here at<br>otago he has trained numerous<br>postgraduate students many of whom as<br>graduates have become academics here in<br>New Zealand or<br>overseas and as a testament to his<br>skills as a mentor and supervisor he has<br>been given the ousa award for excellence<br>in postgraduate<br>supervision his contribution to his own<br>field was recognized by the outstanding<br>plant physiologist award wward by the<br>New Zealand Society of plant physiology<br>in 2005 he has been past president of<br>the New Zealand Society of plant<br>physiologist and the New Zealand<br>Institute of chemists he currently is a<br>member of executive International<br>committees on phototrophy procaryotes<br>and the society for photosynthesis<br>research he is Deputy head of the<br>Department of M of biochemistry and a<br>member of the academic Board of the<br>division of Sciences and the university<br>Board of Graduate Studies like all good<br>academics he has extensive International<br>linkages in recent times he has given<br>invited presentations at International<br>conferences held in the Czech Republic<br>India Thailand Japan twice Canada<br>Australia aeran twice Portugal and New<br>Zealand it is my great pleasure to<br>introduce Professor Julian Eon Roy to<br>present his in aular professorial<br>lecture uh that no doubt will Enlighten<br>us about the pivotal role photosynthesis<br>plays in a healthy oxygen rich Planet<br>welcome Julian a card carrying botanist<br>a practicing biochemist and a closed<br>microbology<br>so I'm going to begin by introducing us<br>to to photosynthesis and and in fact the<br>talk is really going to be about<br>photosystem 2 in photosynthesis and it's<br>going to be a fairly General talk I'm<br>not going to get into I hope details<br>that are too uh nitpicky and I hope that<br>this is a an introduction to a protein<br>that I've worked on for about I know 30<br>years and it's meant a lot to me to do<br>that and be in this field and I hope<br>that I can convey some of that that to<br>you but before we find photosystem 2 I'm<br>going to uh start with this uh picture<br>of a tree and remind everyone that<br>chlorophyll is the pigment that absorbs<br>the energy from the Sun and uh as the<br>vice Chancellor said to begin with we<br>need to fix carbon dioxide um and that<br>happens in the canopy of the tree here<br>and the product is uh carbohydrate this<br>is a C3 sugar called glyceride 3<br>phosphate and the exhaust gas of the<br>whole process is to evolve the oxygen<br>that we breathe which comes from the<br>splitting of<br>water and this whole process C relies<br>on the uh energy from the sun which is U<br>uh about 5,500 zets which is 12,000<br>times the annual Global demand so<br>there's a lot of energy coming in and so<br>in a time when we worry about whether or<br>not we have enough energy we actually<br>have the energy we need the technology<br>to tap into it so in more ordinary terms<br>more energy strikes the Earth in one<br>the scale of photosynthesis is immense<br>the the the green here and the blue are<br>both actually positive indicators of<br>photosynthesis in the oceans there's<br>more in the green area than in the blue<br>and the green areas on land of course<br>are are carbon um fixing going on by<br>photosynthesis and the and the numbers<br>are staggering so uh the terrestrial<br>organisms in the tropical forest and<br>savanas fix around 85 time 10 to the 9<br>tons per year the marine organisms<br>another 120 another terestrial organisms<br>around 53 and that's net so that's after<br>it's respired back out so we're gaining<br>about 258 billion tons of carbon<br>annually each year and this carbon is<br>used to effectively power the planet so<br>life on Earth ultimately depends on<br>photosynthesis and all that carbon gives<br>rise to our food the and all of the the<br>past fossil fuels that we use are all<br>derived from that influx of carbon and<br>the exhaust gas is oxygen and this is a<br>slide that I I show at the beginning of<br>a 200 level lecture to warm people up<br>but it reminds the students that<br>photosynthesis is all about harvesting<br>the energy of the Sun and converting it<br>into chemical energy and then the<br>chemical energy is used to fix carbon<br>dioxide at that large amount the 258<br>billion tons per year and there's an<br>overall simple equation that you can<br>write for the process where where carbon<br>dioxide and water are combined with<br>light to give us sugars and there's the<br>oxygen being given off<br>but photosynthesis does more it's not<br>just food and fuel and oxygen it's also<br>um building materials heating materials<br>it gives rise to um clothing obviously<br>cotton but subsequently wool and even<br>Plastics because fossil fuels of course<br>are the feed stocks for plastic so it's<br>very hard for any process on Earth to be<br>detached from photosynthesis<br>and getting ready for this lecture can<br>make you a bit nervous but this number<br>makes makes me more nervous that is 3:00<br>this afternoon the number of people on<br>the planet and it's increasing by about<br>15 uh a minute and if you do the sums<br>that's a net gain that's after those of<br>us who have left of left these are the<br>net gain is is 78 million a year and uh<br>78 million people are going to want<br>photosynthesis to deliver these Goods to<br>maintain the standard of living that<br>we're used to they're going to want it<br>as well so one of the challenges of<br>course in photosynthesis research then<br>is to contribute to um uh acquiring a<br>source of energy that will help sustain<br>the lifestyle and the quality of life<br>for for those of us who are here and all<br>of those who are rapidly joining<br>us so photosynthesis is at the heart of<br>the carbon cycle 28 billion tons of<br>carbon are fixed each year and that's<br>the net gain even after respiration and<br>that the net gain also drives the food<br>chain this is a vegetarian food chain<br>the elephant is eating uh the the leaves<br>but even vegetarians don't make it and<br>when you die uh the microorganisms<br>recycle you and the CO2 comes back to<br>the atmosphere again and photosynthesis<br>is really at the heart of that process<br>but what I'm going to do today is delve<br>into the Machinery of photosynthesis a<br>little bit go into the canopy go into a<br>plant leaf and go into a plant cell and<br>look at the chloroplasts that are there<br>um as Frank alluded these are actually<br>the are derived from s bacteria<br>originally but now they are uh sort of<br>um living out their life in in plant<br>cells and they have an an external<br>membrane and an internal membrane system<br>and the internal membrane system is the<br>site where the photos systems are<br>located and where the light energy is<br>absorbed and they generate two major<br>compounds one we will abbreviate as ATP<br>and the other as<br>nadph and those compounds which are the<br>result of the energy transduction from<br>um absorbing light are used by by a<br>series of reactions that happen in the<br>aquous compartment up here to fix uh<br>carbon into sugars and the enzyme that<br>does that is called rabisco it stands<br>for ribulose spis phosphate carboxilate<br>oxygenase it's a long name for an enzyme<br>that's very abundant it's the most<br>abundant protein on the planet and so<br>this is the uh sort of the overall<br>summary of of how photosynthesis works<br>the thid membranes have the photosystems<br>they absorb the light energy they<br>generate these products which can then<br>used to fix carbon into the the Cal by<br>into uh sugars by the Calvin Benson<br>cycle and Calvin and Benson of course<br>are the investigators that elucidated<br>that pathway in the<br>1950s so you can actually take this um<br>direct routs and use it to to make<br>biofuels and many people on the planet<br>are trying to do this and this will be<br>part of the way we um solve our energy<br>uh problems in the future so the pathway<br>for bar fuel production we see light<br>coming in it's being absorbed it runs an<br>electron transport chain on those thyo<br>covid membranes we make nadph and ATP we<br>fix carbon into carbohydrate and then<br>you can if you grow algae here they are<br>growing in nice plastic bags um you you<br>have the advantage that you're not<br>competing with the land where you for<br>food and so you you can use algae to to<br>generate products without competing with<br>the food supply which is of course a<br>critical factor and you can divert<br>carbon metabolism towards for example uh<br>extra lipids and that can be turned into<br>biodiesel or you can convert it into<br>substitutes for petrol that butanol can<br>go into an engine of a car and run a car<br>with the current infrastructure and in<br>fact our lab even has played around a<br>little bit with making<br>butanol but the the area I want to get<br>into today is going to be more focused<br>on on on photosystem 2 there was a<br>mention of efficiency in the<br>introduction there the the efficiency of<br>getting down to this end of the pathway<br>is actually quite low it's uh it's<br>probably down around 2 or 3% and um of<br>course organisms are actually designed<br>to reproduce that's what they worry<br>about being efficient at and so there's<br>plenty of light so they don't overdo the<br>uh the capture of light the the higher<br>efficiencies are in the initial<br>reactions which are are close to 100%<br>And I think that's partly because if<br>you're in a shaded environment you want<br>to capture every Photon that comes so<br>you've got a very efficient system to<br>capture light and so it's can you adopt<br>the very highly efficient front end to<br>for um for biofuel production that is<br>one of the things that we'll talk about<br>today so it's hard to remember<br>everything about photosynthesis uh last<br>year I was lucky enough to have a book<br>that that came out that sort of covers<br>the whole field plased biology energy<br>conversion and carbon assimilation and<br>you can see from the look of my face<br>that I was very chuffed by that and the<br>the the uh the the Springer put this up<br>on their website the book will be a<br>valuable resource for advanced students<br>teachers and researchers of<br>photosynthesis and I hope that's the<br>case so it's it's 900 pages and uh we're<br>just going to talk about one chapter<br>that deals with that um protein there<br>2 I want to go back to the beginning and<br>the beginning is going to be the origin<br>of Life briefly just to put a context on<br>photosystem 2 this is actually my<br>beginning um I was born in January this<br>is I think April the 21st 1957 and sadly<br>uh my mom and my dad and my brother are<br>all gone now but uh um I'm still here<br>and though I'm looking at the camera I<br>cannot tell you who took the photo and<br>the when you try and extrapolate back to<br>the beginning of of life on Earth there<br>isn't anybody that can tell you what<br>happened and I'm just going to pick my<br>favorite scenario um that has come from<br>two researchers Mike Russell working at<br>the jet propulsion uh propulsion<br>laboratory in Caltech and William Martin<br>who's Prof professor of Bot<br>in the University of<br>dorf and they have investigated<br>hydrothermal vents at off the<br>Mid-Atlantic Ridge and they're not right<br>on the ridge the the the vents that are<br>right on the ridge are in contact with<br>the magma and the water that comes up is<br>too hot these ones that are off to the<br>side the water is not so hot and down in<br>the crust uh there's a a process where<br>the high pressure water which there is<br>about 150° centigrade is converted in<br>these magnesium silicates Olivine and<br>similar ones into serpentinite and<br>there's a process called<br>serpentinization and as a as a<br>consequence of that chemistry there's an<br>upwelling of water that's coming up to<br>the surface that is very alkaline rich<br>in hydrogen brings up hydrogen sulfide<br>and ammonia and it's coming up to the<br>surface forming these precipitates and<br>there are um in these uh structures that<br>are forming there are microcells that<br>are about a millimeter or a few<br>micrometers in diameter and the ocean<br>and particularly in the hadian when when<br>this is a process going on right now but<br>this is a process that has probably been<br>going on since the beginning of of the<br>planet and the the the acidic hadan<br>ocean would have had a thousand times<br>more CO2 that we have now which would<br>have made a very strong acid alkaline<br>gradient across these micro compartments<br>in these in these structures and that<br>offers of two things it offers a source<br>of energy and it offers a source of<br>concentration for for the or of life and<br>this you can see the plume coming out at<br>the top of one of these things and this<br>symbolizes the uh the micr compartments<br>that are being formed by transition<br>metal sulfide deposits that are forming<br>as the warm water comes up and meets<br>with the ocean and uh what is postulated<br>to occur is and there's certainly today<br>there's methane there's formate there's<br>pentane there are organic molecules<br>formed here and so that's all of the<br>thermodynamics are correct to get<br>Prebiotic chemistry that will uh give us<br>precursors amino acids and sugars and<br>bases they're concentrated it allows for<br>a nice environment for the generation of<br>the RNA world and the formation of<br>ribosomes this then would Advance on to<br>to the DNA era and because you've got<br>that pH gradient the atps that makes ATP<br>evolved in these structures as well so<br>this envisages that the universal<br>ancestor for life on the planet is<br>actually in a rock it was not a free<br>living cell and then uh this<br>subsequently uh moved on and there was<br>some more biochemistry invented and and<br>these these microc compartments<br>developed membranes the archia bacteria<br>being one form of procariota being<br>procaryotes but one of them is the way<br>they make their membranes and then these<br>would have uh gone off and we would have<br>had darwinian Evolution so at this point<br>there's no<br>photosynthesis uh but then um there's As<br>you move into the archan you get<br>cytochromes formed and Quinones electron<br>trans molecules that expand the capacity<br>of those cells to do electron transport<br>and to harness proton gradients that<br>they can now use because they form<br>membranes and their atpa is sitting in<br>the membrane and you can see from a heem<br>to a chlorophyll that there aren't too<br>many steps necessary to to get an extra<br>ring and a tail and as soon as bacteria<br>were photosynthetic then they could move<br>away and not be dependent on chemical<br>nutrition and they could actually use<br>light to drive their systems and uh<br>evolution is really starting to gather<br>speed and there is about two billion<br>years here of the the age of the<br>bacteria when they dominated the planet<br>before one of those Ary bacteria<br>engulfed the U bacterium and gave rise<br>to the mitochondria and the eukariotic<br>cell so on that pathway at around 2.5<br>billion years ago things change in a big<br>way and we get oxygenic<br>photosynthesis so all of these systems<br>I'm just going to use this slide to just<br>briefly reiterate the point of these<br>proton gradients whether you or not<br>you're in the bacteria which gave rise<br>to the mitochondria or a photosynthetic<br>bacteria or in aab bacterial electron<br>transport chain you are all these<br>electron transport chains are designed<br>to move protons across the membrane and<br>that puts a proton gradient that can be<br>used back out through the ATP a that was<br>formed way back in the in the Mounds at<br>the hydrothermal vents and this then<br>allows you to generate the ATP which is<br>used to run metabolism in in cells and<br>this concept was first put on the table<br>by Mitchell in a paper in 1961 in nature<br>and he eventually got the Nobel Prize in<br>chemistry in 1978 and he called it CH<br>osmosis so oxygenic photosynthesis is<br>harnessing the power of chem osmosis and<br>allowing for an efficient electron<br>transport chain and when you you when<br>you see this protein for the first time<br>you might say wow that's incredibly<br>complicated how did that suddenly arise<br>2.5 billion years ago but remember we've<br>already had the ribosome which is also<br>incredibly complicated we've already had<br>the atpa and and we've already had a<br>number of respiratory enzymes evolv that<br>bind cytochromes and can use Quinones to<br>shutle electron transport so to get this<br>complexity was clearly within the scope<br>of of nature it was not such a huge<br>Challenge and we'll learn as we go along<br>that one of the things about fer system<br>too that's very interesting is that it<br>turns over very rapidly and therefore<br>provides a model system for us to study<br>how nature actually went about building<br>uh such membrane proteins that are so<br>complicated certainly the arrival of<br>oxygen can be described as the Big Bang<br>in biology because uh oxygen itself then<br>allows for the development of large body<br>plans and and and the development of<br>large organisms so you can refer to<br>photosystem 2 also as the engine of Life<br>by generating this oxygen and the other<br>remarkable thing about it is that if you<br>want to do that reaction yourself uh you<br>would have to heat water to 2,000 de<br>Centigrade whereas it decomposes uh at<br>ambient temperatures in plants out into<br>needen at any time of the year so uh the<br>this enzymes solves the the<br>thermodynamic problem of of getting<br>water to break down and to give us the<br>electrons that can go down the electron<br>transport chain and the protons that can<br>be coupled to ATP production and also of<br>course to hydrogen<br>production so photosystem 2 the engine<br>of life it's also uh produced oxygen<br>that gave rise to the ozone layer and<br>that means that it protected us from UV<br>radiation and that allowed organisms<br>also to spread out across the planet and<br>it is also as I mentioned before made<br>possible the evolution of large body<br>body plans to support aerobic<br>respiration so the Advent of this enzyme<br>has a major impact on our environment<br>this is me with months in<br>1963 I don't remember it hurting I<br>certainly had chubby cheeks but so here<br>I am being exposed to a virus and many<br>of you perhaps had the same virus and we<br>we survive without any problem and it's<br>because we've got some kind of immunity<br>from prior experience and our bodies in<br>this case fighted off in about six days<br>when photosystem 2 did this reaction and<br>produced oxygen it creates a problem<br>because oxygen is in a sense is also<br>toxic because it forms reactive oxygen<br>species which attack attack proteins so<br>the fact that it existed and that this<br>metal center in here became this complex<br>here this oxygen evolving enzyme and it<br>worked it says that there must have been<br>some form of pre- protection to stop<br>this from autod destructing when it<br>started to make oxygen and that leads to<br>a couple of I guess speculations but uh<br>one of them is that the the development<br>of electron transport chains must have<br>actually um resulted in a need to<br>develop antioxidant machinery and<br>remember there was no UV at this point<br>so you've got UV bombarding water<br>splitting water and you're getting<br>oxygen from that so it looks like there<br>was some oxygen before oxygenic<br>photosynthesis and the enzymes that<br>dissipated the reactive oxygen species<br>and I summarize some of them here here's<br>oxygen o if it picks up an electron when<br>it shouldn't it makes a super oxide<br>anion and that's very reactive if it<br>interacts with an excited chlorophyll<br>you get an energy transfer and you get<br>Sid oxygen and that's very reactive you<br>need to be able to manage these species<br>and it seems that there was likely<br>enzymes such as super oxide dismutase<br>already present because of those nent<br>electron transport chains and in fact<br>the manganese Center there is probably<br>the origin of the manganese Center<br>that's in the oxygen evolving complex so<br>it probably evolved from that and<br>there's one other neat thing that when<br>you stop and think about this issue and<br>that is if the UV is coming in and<br>bombarding the ocean and we're getting<br>oxygen released uh in the early<br>atmosphere that oxygen will be snapped<br>up by iron in the crust just like that<br>and so that leaves the hydrogen and the<br>hydrogen's going to go wafting off into<br>space because gravity is not strong<br>enough to hang on to hydrogen so at this<br>point 2.5 billion years ago we're on our<br>way to Mars and Venus and so this enzyme<br>putting oxygen in the atmosphere and<br>therefore recombining with the hydrogen<br>to keep the water on the planet is also<br>of course something that we're all very<br>thankful<br>for so I got interested in it and I<br>decided I'd go and study it and uh I<br>went to Illinois and um they got there<br>in 1981 and I was going to study the uh<br>electron transfer to to Quinones in<br>photosystem 2 and I was interested in<br>the the proton um coupling of that and<br>the proton transfer across the membranes<br>associated with making ATP that was what<br>was on my mind when when I accepted the<br>project and the project I was given was<br>called the bicarbonate effect and it<br>takes just a moment to set the context<br>it goes back to Otto wber warberg was a<br>very successful biochemist and got the<br>Nobel Prize for um uh his work on<br>cytochromes in electron transport chains<br>and I have his biography M Smith and I<br>will give it back to you and uh um the<br>uh warberg uh was I don't know he was<br>fixated on the fact that the oxygen in<br>photosynthesis came from CO2 and not<br>from water and in when I was one year<br>old he did an experiment here where he<br>flushed out this the these algae with<br>Argan and got rid of the oxygen got rid<br>of the CO2 and slowed down the rate of<br>oxygen production and he said hey that's<br>why uh that's showing you that the<br>oxygen comes from uh from CO2 and not<br>from water if I remove the CO2 I slow<br>down the oxygen that idea goes back to<br>the end of the 18th 18th century<br>actually Joseph Priestley and 1771 had<br>done a very famous experiment where he<br>had a bell jar and he put a candle in it<br>and he burned it and used up all the<br>oxygen then put a poor Mouse in there<br>and the mouse suffocated and then he uh<br>put a plant in the Bell jar as you would<br>and uh uh then put a mouse back in a<br>different Mouse and then<br>that and that mouse ran around very<br>happily and uh so priest he said look<br>I've I've discovered oxygen the French<br>would say laier discovered oxygen the<br>British would say Priestly discovered<br>photosynthesis but this man ingan house<br>who was Dutch U helped Priestley out<br>because Priestley couldn't repeat his<br>experiment and it was ingen house that<br>showed that he needed to put light on<br>the plant to make this happen and uh his<br>his contemporar senar and Sala also<br>showed that you needed CO2 and water and<br>they came up with the idea that here is<br>an equation that summarized photosystem<br>2 when you cleave the carbon dioxide you<br>get the oxygen and you get the<br>carbohydrate and that's stuck around<br>until<br>1932 when this guy Cornelius fandel<br>working at the uh joh uh at the Hopkins<br>Marine station in um in Stanford uh<br>working with purple so so sulfur<br>bacteria so bacteria that don't evolve<br>oxygen but actually use hydrogen sulfide<br>and he could smell the sulfur and he<br>proposed this important um equation<br>where he said right the electron donor<br>is hydrogen sulfide I get sulfur if I<br>generalize that then I can say it's h2a<br>and I'll get 2A and if it's a green<br>plant that's water and I'll get oxygen<br>so he proposed correctly in 1932 that it<br>was oxygen and that was proved uh by two<br>key experiments one in 1939 by Robin<br>Hill in Cambridge who isolated his<br>chloroplast from algae extracted the<br>thid membranes got rid of all the<br>Machinery involving rabisco and CO2<br>fixation and sha light on those thids<br>with an electron acceptor present and<br>measured oxygen coming off so that was<br>yes uh um vanil is correct and then uh<br>Martin Cayman and San rubben working in<br>Burke<br>got themselves a collection of 180 water<br>from the Lawrence synchrotron and they<br>did an experiment with mass spectrometry<br>to show that the oxygen that was evolved<br>from this water was always the 18<br>isotope and not the 16 oxygen isotope<br>that was in the CO2 so it looked like it<br>was a done deal but then uh someone in<br>gingis lab rediscovered this idea of<br>warberg in 1958 and they did an<br>experiment where they were able to scrub<br>out all of the CO2 and they stopped the<br>the reaction of oxygen Evolution which<br>is by this time was called the hill<br>reaction after after Robin Hill and so<br>they could recover that by adding<br>bicarbonate back and then I came on the<br>scene and this is actually at Go's<br>retirement in 1999 and uh I decided I<br>was going to look at this bicarbonate<br>effect because there was evidence from<br>this lab that it was on the quinone<br>reactions and not on the oxygen evolving<br>reactions and to do that as a botanist I<br>had to build<br>this and this took me two years and it<br>was a lot of fun and I learned a lot of<br>things and I wrote it in a computer<br>language called fourth which I don't<br>think anybody else knows anything about<br>I've never heard of it since but I I<br>bought a book I read it then programmed<br>the this thing and I built this machine<br>that I if I take the lid off that I had<br>to hand wire literally hundreds and<br>hundreds of connections between the pins<br>on the chips and there's a 12volt power<br>supply and a 5volt power supply and<br>among all the hundreds of wires that I<br>connected when I turned on the switch<br>there was a disappointing pause that<br>nothing happened and then Flames leapt<br>fortunately my board that I had W up<br>survived and and the my gingi allowed me<br>to buy a new motherboard for the<br>computer and eventually we got the<br>machine going and we were able to do<br>experiments that that the measured<br>electron<br>transport from the reaction Center of<br>photosystem to to to reduce these<br>Quinones and so the idea of the<br>experiment is very simple you put a you<br>give a bright flash of light and you<br>then the chlorophyll molecule absorbs<br>that and it puts an electron onto the<br>first of these quinonic ctors there are<br>two of them there and then the oxygen<br>evolving complex gives an electron to<br>this so that it becomes neutral again<br>and then the electron from QA goes all<br>the way over to QB the second quinone<br>acceptor and then you can repeat the<br>cycle and the reduced uh QB I've lost my<br>cursor there diffuses off down the<br>membrane to a place where it can be<br>oxidized and pass the electrons along<br>the chain and if you actually um give<br>one Flash and then wait a long time<br>before you give a second Flash the<br>electrons got to QB and the fluoresence<br>that you get back is low but if you give<br>a Flash and then another one very<br>quickly the system still has the<br>electron on QA and it can't do the<br>charge separation there and the energy<br>comes back and the fluoresence is high<br>so by firing off this flash lamp<br>different time durations it was possible<br>to get the kinetics of that reaction and<br>I show it here um this is out of my<br>thesis I think this picture inhibited by<br>a herbicide dcmu atene does the same<br>same thing that blocks this binding site<br>but bicarbonate did the same thing and<br>and I was able to conclude in the thesis<br>that that bicarbonate was actually<br>regulating electron transfer between QA<br>and QB and this is what wook had seen<br>and we also at that point knew that<br>there was a non-em iron in the system<br>and we hypothesized that the bicarbonate<br>was a a liant to that nonh unfortunately<br>my colleagues were Skeptics and they<br>they they said first of all why worry<br>about wiberg's ideas they're nuts people<br>already know it oxygen comes from water<br>and secondly they said said you got to<br>treat this with low ph and formate to<br>get rid of the bicarbonate then you have<br>to use 10 m m bicarbonate to get it back<br>and it's reproducible but basically<br>julin it's an artifact so I was very<br>pleased in the structure that came out<br>in 2010 sitting right next to the nonh<br>is indeed bicarbonate and and there is a<br>channel that goes out to the surface to<br>show where the bicarbonate can diffuse<br>through and here's the QA and QB<br>electron carriers that are there in in<br>the structure and this is a it's a<br>modification that is different from the<br>anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria who<br>use a glutamate residue there so one of<br>the questions of course is why the high<br>plants use bicarbonate and not glutamate<br>I'll speculate on that at the very<br>end all right so i' done some biophysics<br>there I needed to learn some new things<br>I went off as a postto and uh I went to<br>Japan worked with noro Morata learned<br>how to isolate proteins hydrophilic<br>proteins and I had a mustache when I<br>worked in the lab and a nice Sushi<br>jacket and then I went and worked with<br>this guy viin veras uh who is about 10<br>years younger than me you would not know<br>it and uh he's very bright he's burned<br>out fast but he at least his body's<br>burned out fast his brain is very sharp<br>uh um so he taught me molecular genetics<br>and I picked up the sin of bacterial<br>system and became the closet<br>microbiologist and there's Gove sitting<br>next to Christa kitley who was a posto<br>when I was in the lab this is in 2000<br>and Christa was professor of botney in<br>in Brisbane and finally I wound up with<br>Jeffrey Hind and with Jeffrey I learned<br>to uh uh to isolate membrane proteins<br>from photosystem 2 and Jeffrey actually<br>is worth a quick mention because he was<br>the first person to prove that Mitchell<br>was right on with with chem osmosis he<br>did an experiment John Hopkins with his<br>mentor Andre jagendorf to to show that<br>if you sh elect light on on thos you<br>could measure the proton uptake just as<br>predicted by Mitchell and then he did a<br>brilliant experiment where he he<br>actually uh incubated the the thyo<br>membrane so that he put an artificial<br>proton gradient between the Lumen and<br>the outside of of the prep put it in the<br>dark no electron transport just a proton<br>gradient added ATP and in organic<br>phosphate and got got ATP and they<br>published a paper in 63 and a followup<br>in ' 65 so photosynthesis went with ch<br>osmosis early the mitochondrial people<br>took another decade which is why<br>Mitchell didn't get his Nobel Prize to<br>78 um so be it I came to<br>denan this is uh the lab as I saw it<br>when I came in April 1994 it was empty<br>and uh this was the door to M's office<br>and also the door to George Peterson's<br>office when George Peterson was there<br>and I think this lab was actually built<br>for for George to do nip out of the<br>office and do science but when perhaps<br>there was more time for HDs to do<br>science in those<br>days uh MV was very good to be I think<br>he gave me a budget of 10 or $20,000 and<br>we gradually built up the lab and<br>there's the first crew of honor students<br>starting in February<br>1995 and Nick Fleming now is working<br>over in pathology uh Victoria there is a<br>lecturer at uh at Lincoln and Shannon is<br>I think a senior scientist now with with<br>ag research so they've all gone on to to<br>to do science I I I stayed on London<br>Street I guess MV arranged it for me to<br>have a bed and breakfast for a little<br>while and then I had to find a place to<br>live after all those years post talking<br>and being a PhD she not have any money<br>and uh so I I could walk so I walked<br>around somebody said you know Mary Hill<br>is not that bad she's not far from the<br>University I found this little place<br>being rented on the first weekend in<br>town I rented this room it had nothing<br>in it and uh you you have you've got a<br>job right you have to think what am I<br>going to do you actually need clean<br>clothes this is actually the first<br>problem right I couldn't find a laundry<br>mat in this town at least not in walking<br>distance so I was off to off the Barnet<br>I think I paid cash for the iron in the<br>ironing board but I the C the washing<br>machine and driver on credit after the<br>end of the week sleeping on the floor in<br>a sleeping bag the next thing I wanted<br>was a<br>bed and so I went and bought a bed and<br>and a blanket to keep warm and a duvet<br>bed this is my first lecture uh I've<br>been here about six weeks uh this Kevin<br>who's out there in the audience with<br>Paula Jameson had established this<br>wonderful course in in plant biology<br>looking at molecular and physiological<br>plant biology so it was a joint effort<br>from the very beginning between botany<br>and biochemistry and the class was was<br>very small Diane there went on and did I<br>think a PhD with Paul guy Jenny did one<br>with Dave burret and Peter Bannister Tom<br>went off to Australia this guy uh<br>Barnaby May was an honor student in<br>chemistry and he got his PhD I think in<br>Canterbury and there's Shannon and she<br>came on and joined my lab so they pretty<br>much all went on in in science U over<br>the years we changed the name to plant<br>biotechnology and and then we've sort of<br>revamp the course we now call this<br>course applied plant science and we<br>focus on real practical issues of where<br>plants are actually making a difference<br>to the planet so David looks at David<br>burret does cleaning up pollution and<br>Chernobyl with plants and Tina<br>Summerfield does biofuels and Richard<br>mcnight talks about the importance of<br>secondary plant uh products for for<br>commercial exploitation and the students<br>like it and we had 37 students this year<br>and it's I think you know it's an<br>important thing for for our University<br>that we have a strong plant<br>biotechnology thing because New Zealand<br>needs plant biotechnologies right you<br>know and it's it's nuts that we don't<br>make more of it you know and so we've<br>got to keep them<br>coming well that was happening the uh uh<br>in back in 1995 there there was a floor<br>being built and this is me standing in<br>my office there and uh that's the that's<br>the door back there and there's Kevin<br>standing in his office too so he also<br>would creep up there and that that was<br>where he he was and Richard mcnight now<br>in that office there and Lynette is in<br>in this office here Lynette joined us<br>most recently and uh this<br>um I you know I'd go up there almost<br>every night and I'm going to keep you<br>here for a long time I have to be<br>careful but I I would go up there almost<br>every night sort of think about the lab<br>and how how it was working and often<br>you'd hear the footsteps coming down the<br>corridor and it would be MV having a<br>look to see how it was going on and this<br>is uh I think he didn't even know I was<br>there half the time but this was uh um<br>you know I think a great achievement for<br>murf that he got that top floor on<br>biochemistry for us and and the lab's<br>running very well here it is in 10 years<br>later with how we went off to work on<br>bar fuels in in Denmark uh with my dad<br>at 86 coming out to see me in in 2006 so<br>the lab is going strong and we all enjoy<br>working there so what do we do there now<br>um as I said I was interested in the<br>difference between uh photosynthetic<br>bacteria and and and the uh and the<br>green plant transition between these<br>these photosystems and um the the<br>reaction Center associated with the<br>photosynthetic bacteria is depicted here<br>and it was a milestone in in<br>Biochemistry it was the first m bran<br>protein ever crystallized by uh ML<br>deisenhofer and Huber they were the the<br>scientists that did it in Germany and<br>they of course got the Nobel Prize in<br>1988 for for that<br>achievement and but if you compare that<br>with photosystem 2 you can see that<br>there's a great jump in complexity from<br>this bacterial reaction Center to<br>photosystem 2 and the difference is that<br>this one can can um split water so the<br>question then becomes why this<br>additional complexity what is the<br>necessity for all of this complexity to<br>allow it to to split water and sort of<br>been looking at that as we've moved on<br>particularly in the last five or six<br>years and there's ways that you can do<br>this these are cab bacteria growing in<br>flasks and it's very easy to to to knock<br>out a gene and look for the uh the<br>effect of that and this the the proteins<br>inside this dotted line these membrane<br>spanning hoses looking down at the top<br>of the complex actually they all have<br>their counterpart in in photosystem one<br>there are two photosystems in in in<br>electron transport in in plants and they<br>also have their C of part in in<br>different kinds of bacterial<br>photosynthetic reaction centers the<br>unique proteins are the gray ones that<br>are all around the outside like a<br>horseshoe and uh and there's some that<br>sit at the monomer monomer interface and<br>so we've been sort of knocking out the<br>genes for these and looking to see if<br>there was any phenotype and for example<br>when we knock out that one there uh we<br>stop the Assembly of the complex and<br>we've also studied the number of these<br>proteins that sit as a cap over the<br>oxygen evolving complex and they provide<br>a channel for the water to get in and<br>the oxygen to get out and the protons to<br>get out and we've also looked to see<br>what happens when you when you remove<br>those the this work got us interested in<br>in biogenesis of the complex and what I<br>attempted to do in this little diagram<br>here uh is to summarize the photosystem<br>to with that core set of proteins that<br>are common to many reaction centers and<br>then put around the outside all of the<br>proteins that are unique and they're<br>given letters of the alphabet and each<br>one is relatively small and then those<br>are the three proteins which would you<br>see down here and there's the manganese<br>Center which is is sitting there so<br>that's the crystallographic system and<br>now it turns out that when you purify<br>photos system to there are a whole bunch<br>of non-crystallographic proteins<br>associated with it as well and there<br>there's five listed here and it's a list<br>that's growing all the time and there<br>are three others which uh seem to play a<br>role and and these proteins are not in<br>the crystal structure and yet they're<br>required to get to this system so<br>they're part of the photos system but<br>they're not there the mature complex and<br>so we were interested in finding out<br>what do they do and how how do they work<br>and you can see the attraction if<br>remember this this complex formed once<br>all that uh time ago 2.5 or more billion<br>years ago so it's possible that by<br>exploiting this uh um system to study<br>the Assembly of this complex you can<br>learn something about how uh very<br>ancient protein complexes were were<br>assembled at this this early time in<br>life on the<br>planet these three proteins are<br>particularly special as they have a<br>lipid attachment with them that allows<br>them to bind up to the complex or at<br>least that could be the explanation for<br>it and we actually embarked on an effort<br>over a period of about four years to get<br>the structures of these three proteins<br>and we were successful and um I'll just<br>show you initially we started out<br>looking at Sino q and um sorry about the<br>names of all these things and all the<br>letters but that that that protein we<br>knocked out the gene for it and in fact<br>uh we did it in in a in a way where we<br>made mutants so we took knocked out that<br>the gene for that and the gene for that<br>and that was one mutant we knocked out<br>the gene for that and the gene for that<br>and that was another mutant and likewise<br>the gene for that and the gene for that<br>and that was another mutant and then we<br>compared growth and the work was done by<br>by Tina Summerfield and um uh uh Jackie<br>Daniels as she know is and I expect<br>Jackie is here somewhere and Jackie has<br>been the technician in the lab since<br>1996 and so she's just yeah so sort of<br>keeps me on the straight and narrow and<br>Fiona was became a PhD student she's now<br>in Colorado still working in science in<br>bofs they all like to go to biofuels um<br>so what we found out was this particular<br>double mutant didn't grow and it was the<br>first evidence that that Q protein was<br>P2 specific but if you gave it sugar and<br>so it didn't need photos system too it<br>could grow fine so we were on to the<br>fact that that was a pier2 specific<br>protein and then uh uh we went ahead and<br>and got the the crystal structure and uh<br>Simon Jackson was did it was part of his<br>PhD and Rob fand who joined me as a<br>postto after getting his degree with Sig<br>uh and he's now in pen Penn State um and<br>that's his presumably his first<br>Halloween coming up here and<br>uh he helped us and we we got this<br>structure and now we're able to study<br>how the the protein protein interactions<br>between q and the photo system too<br>complex by looking at the structure and<br>looking at comparative sequences and in<br>fact a student came to me yesterday and<br>asked if they could do just that and I<br>said yes you can we also looked at the<br>this 27 protein this is a lovely example<br>where was a collaboration in the<br>department to solve a problem sigard<br>co-supervised Peter with me and sigot is<br>the crystallographer of course and and<br>we tried quite hard with crystallography<br>and we had Katherine on the committee<br>and Katherine likes to work with NMR to<br>solve proteins and so she was able to<br>say well all right I can put you in<br>touch with my colleague Mark Hines over<br>at the weeh high and we can do this one<br>by NMR and so we did and Katherine<br>helped Peter learn how to do the<br>assignments and we solve that protein<br>and both those proteins were first they<br>were competitive and we got there first<br>uh Mark Hines also helped Simon get a<br>third one cyan op and we were second<br>there but Simon's structure is better<br>than the other one okay it really is I'm<br>not just saying that so uh so that's<br>great and so we solved those three<br>proteins and now we're busy thinking<br>about how they will interact with the<br>photosystem and this one's the most<br>enigmatic and you can model and uh the<br>uh the the slide is being chopped around<br>a little bit but we can still see what<br>it says um we can model how that protein<br>can bind to photosystem too and it binds<br>in the Lumen when you model it in the<br>computer my students hate the fact that<br>I like to make models they say Jun is<br>going to be wrong but I just want to<br>tell them all models in science are<br>wrong right up to the last one if you<br>don't make a model you can't test it so<br>uh uh so here we are here is a wrong<br>model for all of my students that we can<br>test and refine but it seems to be<br>associated with with the the the luminal<br>side of photos system to and it seems to<br>be iated with a co-actor that's that is<br>involved with uh the Assembly of the<br>oxygen evolving complex in a process<br>that's known as photoactivation and I<br>just summarize that in this this diagram<br>here you you start with the the the<br>enzyme in the dark and there's no<br>manganese bound and if you put a photon<br>in you can oxidize one of these manganes<br>and it sticks and then if there's<br>calcium present it moves to the next<br>state and you can see there's a calcium<br>in the final assembled complex then you<br>have to put in another Photon to lock in<br>that next manganese and then there's a<br>dark rear Arrangement and if you give a<br>few more flashes of light you you arrive<br>at this this system and it looks like<br>the one possibility is that cop can can<br>contribute to to that process to<br>actually make the oxygen evolving<br>complex ready for uh activity and plants<br>will be doing this at dawn as as the sun<br>comes<br>up then the the next thing that you want<br>to worry about with photosystem 2 is is<br>actually how does this water splitting<br>reaction occur and so you you make this<br>would be the the complex that's just<br>been made by photo assembly and then<br>it's got to uh perform the chemistry the<br>chemistry it's got to do is actually<br>interface um oxidizing two waters which<br>is a four electron chemistry to the one<br>electron steps associated with the<br>photochemistry and Pierre jolio who's<br>now 80 I've got his picture over here<br>recognized in 1969 that there was a<br>periodicity of four if he gave four<br>photons he needed four turnovers to to<br>get oxygen and then Bessel who<br>unfortunately died in 1979 in 1970<br>Bessel coock came up with a model that<br>said you need five oxidation states to<br>achieve that and he called them the S<br>States S01 2 3 4 and it's a testament to<br>the Insight of these guys in the great<br>experiments they did that that is still<br>the Paradigm to study this reaction in<br>2013 even though it was hypothesized in<br>1970 and the filling in of the oxidation<br>States reflects the progress made in uh<br>in spectroscopy between their and now I<br>just point up here that's Madame Curry<br>and uh uh Pierre curri and remember they<br>got the Nobel Prize in physics for<br>discovering radioactivity and then<br>unfortunately he was hit by a horse and<br>cart but she went on and discovered<br>radium and polonium and got the Nobel<br>Prize in chemistry and that's uh Irene<br>uh um jolio curri she married Frederick<br>jolio and she got the Nobel Prize uh for<br>artificial radioactivity and she is his<br>mom and unfortunately he didn't get the<br>Nobel Prize but he did give us this and<br>it really is a major<br>contribution so I can just briefly show<br>you how it works I called it the ticking<br>clock and the clock is ticking and I<br>imagine some of you are saying Julian<br>okay that's good we're moving along now<br>but the the the I'll just do one of<br>these for you what I've done is I've<br>Stripped Away the protein environment so<br>you can see the co-actors and it's this<br>is the stuff that's got the high<br>efficiency this is the stuff that has a<br>Quantum yield of about one and so when<br>you an electron when a photon comes in<br>uh it it it it will uh Advance this<br>system first of all the photon goes to<br>the chlorophylls that are at the<br>reaction Center which we call p680 and<br>it'll move the the electron up to the<br>quinone and there's the ion where the<br>bicarbonate binds and it'll you'll get<br>that electron transfer reaction and then<br>this residue here will replace the<br>electron that's gone and then the<br>manganese in this complex will replace<br>the electron that's left that and you'll<br>see that this manganese 3 is steps up to<br>an oxidation state of Manganese 4 and<br>and this repeats for each of the flashes<br>until you get to the final state that<br>nobody's ever got any information<br>because it's so transient and that's um<br>then decomposes oxygen comes off and the<br>whole thing resets and you bind two more<br>Waters and you can do the cycle<br>again the the the structure we now have<br>a structure of the manganese uh complex<br>it's a manganese calcium sort of<br>distorted<br>cubane complex and it's got four Waters<br>bound to it frustratingly in the crystal<br>structure and it was believed we were<br>looking at that State when the structure<br>came out in 2010 but it's now clear that<br>the amount of radiation that's been used<br>to get this this structure is probably<br>reducing the manganese back and it's now<br>unclear if we're in this state or even<br>below that oxidation state so it means<br>that it's very close to a a real model<br>and resolution now and and then people<br>will be able to do the biometic systems<br>based upon it but got to overcome this<br>radiation damage problem uh I would say<br>in just just a couple of years now we<br>will have the full mechanism of this<br>reaction so that's the promise of the of<br>the of getting that catalytic site we<br>also have been interested in in the<br>protein framework that surrounds the<br>system and I've just got one little uh<br>um story here that just shows you the<br>complexity of the photosystem at the<br>level of of of proteins and you've got<br>to make the system and that's a membrane<br>sitting there and initially there's a a<br>complex that forms between one of these<br>transmembrane spanning um proteins that<br>were gray in one of the previous<br>diagrams and a part of the reaction<br>Center which all of these names are<br>Dreadful which we call D2 and uh this<br>then has to combine with another complex<br>which has D1 and of course you'll see<br>this has come in with 1 two 3 four five<br>polypeptides so you still need to<br>actually understand how that complex was<br>made before you get to this pre complex<br>certainly uh this protein here is to do<br>with folding of this protein as it comes<br>in the membrane it's got five membrane<br>spanning heles it's got the bind<br>chlorophyll and all of those co-actors<br>this protein probably brings manganese<br>and this comes as a precursor and it has<br>to be processed and the processing of<br>that involves another polypeptoid called<br>ycf48 and we make that one blue because<br>we're actually actively studying that<br>one in the lab right now and how it<br>interacts in the bar Genesis pathway<br>you've got to clear that away and you<br>get a mature form and then you need to<br>bring in uh a protein complex which is<br>bringing more chlorophylls which operate<br>as an antenna that can pass the light<br>energy to the reaction Center that's<br>sitting in here and again the yxh LMT<br>make it through to the crystal structure<br>but the 28 and this SL 933 uh do not and<br>we're interested in the role of that one<br>so that's another protein structure<br>that's available and you can study how<br>it enables this antenna to come together<br>then you've got to bring in the other<br>half of the antenna system which will<br>fly in I think from this side any moment<br>and our psb27 protein that Peter solved<br>is interacting with that complex and we<br>want to understand the protein protein<br>interactions there that allow that come<br>to come together then you've got to get<br>that out of the way then you've got to<br>do the photo assembly of the actual<br>oxygen evolving complex and then you've<br>got to put on the extrinsic proteins and<br>we be hypothesizing our Q comes in at<br>this point and then this thing has to<br>become a<br>dimer then it's working and we can<br>disrupt this interface by attacking M<br>making mutants there we've done that too<br>and it still works even if it's<br>monus but it's working at the edge of<br>sort of chemistry it's the very high<br>Redux potentials the the redox potential<br>that's its desire to take an electron<br>from water it is the the highest<br>oxidizing um component in biology and it<br>actually damages itself so you get a<br>damaged reaction Center protein and then<br>the system in a coordinated way um has<br>to go to a monomer has to remove those<br>extrinsic proteins it's got to get the<br>uh cp43 antenna out of the way so<br>proteases can get in there get rid of<br>the guy that's uh damaged ribosomes got<br>to make a new protein got to insert that<br>in there it's got to be processed again<br>the ycf 48's got to come back in and<br>then the cp43 has to rejoin the complex<br>and we actually think that the uh um<br>movement of uh cp43 in and out from the<br>reaction Center may have something to do<br>with why uh the system is switched to<br>using bicarbonate in the reaction Center<br>and not the glutamate that actually<br>there's part of the signal comes<br>bicarbonat involved with part of the<br>signal that controls that little shunt<br>there<br>uh okay we've got to get rid of the 27<br>we've got a photoactivate it and we've<br>got to put the cap on and then it's got<br>to become a dimer again and the the the<br>important thing about this is that this<br>complex is turning over all the time<br>it's repairing itself so it can sustain<br>oxygen Evolution so it's got<br>intrinsically built into its self-repair<br>so by understanding the self-repair<br>that's going on here then you can design<br>that and build it into biomagnetic<br>systems so that you can prolong the<br>lifetime of these devices so that you<br>can have artificial water splitting<br>complexes that will give you hydrogen as<br>fuel so you to get to this uh you you<br>you want to understand uh the the self<br>repair systems and that's what we're<br>trying to do um when we look at at at<br>the Assembly of the oxygen involving<br>complex or the Assembly of this complex<br>and then you can ask how that can be<br>contributed into the design of<br>biomagnetic devices that will will will<br>perform water splitting and there's<br>another critical point and it's very<br>critical for the 78 million people that<br>are about to join us is that the the<br>if that repair process if it gets out of<br>kilter so when you're in in a stressed<br>environment the rate of damage doesn't<br>keep up with the rate of repair and<br>therefore crop yields go down and so if<br>you can study that repair process it was<br>quite complicated but by studying it in<br>plants that are resistant in harsh<br>environments then you identify traits<br>that you can transfer over into crop<br>plants so that you can then grow the<br>crop plants in marginal lands to to to<br>feed people and as I say there's 78<br>million more in 2014 than there is in<br>2013 and it's not stopping<br>yet one last point and this is the uh<br>the synthetic approach this is a this is<br>come out of the chemistry Department<br>Penn State and the apply named uh Center<br>for Bio inspired catalysis for solar<br>fuel generation at Arizona State<br>University and what these guys have done<br>uh you can read it there it's electron<br>transfer reactions in the media based D<br>sensitized tanium oxide photo anod<br>showing molecular structures of the bit<br>mediator 3p rubidium D and the C linking<br>group so what have they got they've got<br>a a Dy here renum diey coupled to a<br>titanium oxide uh electrode surface and<br>then they've got a this this carboxy<br>phosphonic acid Linker to the Iridium<br>oxide here which is mimicking the oxygen<br>evolving complex so this is a<br>nanoparticle that can can split water<br>and then they've got this uh the Benz um<br>uh the Benz idal phenol there that guy<br>there as the mediator to return the<br>electron to the ridium die so they can<br>make this thing go but look at the it's<br>only 2% okay for these guys I don't want<br>to belittle that that's a big deal<br>that's a totally synthetic<br>photosynthesis in principle based<br>reaction Center that's splitting water<br>um but it says it's possible and we can<br>do it but one of the problems is that<br>ridium and um idium are are some of the<br>most rare uh elements transition metals<br>and so you can't really expect everyone<br>to have one of these on their roof you<br>you've got to understand plant system<br>which uses manganese and calcium and<br>that's abundant and no problem and then<br>take that and then build that system and<br>build it in and that's the goal so I I<br>when I finish up with my 200 level<br>lectures possibly the 100 level lecture<br>I get them mixed up um that I I I finish<br>by by saying putting up this slide and<br>i' say the understanding how photosystem<br>to soles the challenging thermodynamics<br>of water splitting will facilitate the<br>design of biomagnetic systems to fulfill<br>the vision of Jules ver and Jules ver<br>actually said this at the end of the<br>19th century he said I believe that<br>water will one day be employed as fuel<br>that hydrogen and oxygen which<br>constitute it used singly all together<br>will furnish an inexhaustible source of<br>heat and light of an intensity of which<br>cold is not capable I believe then that<br>when the deposits of coal are exhausted<br>we shall heat and warm ourselves with<br>water water will be the cold of the<br>so it's my job to thank Julian for an<br>outstanding lecture and it really was an<br>outstanding lecture and I think behind<br>every outstanding scientist there is a<br>incredibly neat puzzle and you've got it<br>an incredibly neat puzzle that is your<br>passion and that that really shows<br>through and so this was just an amazing<br>tour to force and I think we started out<br>really with something we know right we<br>all know how important the sun is how<br>much energy the sun provides the Earth<br>and how that energy has the capability<br>of revolutionizing our our whole<br>civilization so we came here knowing<br>that but I think Julian you delineated<br>for us how much more we know in in terms<br>of I mean we know the names of all the<br>proteins involved and all the lipids and<br>all the metals but beyond beyond that we<br>actually know the detailed molecular<br>structure of how the system is laid out<br>which stretches how important molecular<br>structure research is in<br>Biochemistry so because we know the<br>detailed molecular structure we we are<br>actually beginning to understand how the<br>electrons flow and how the photons flow<br>and how the protons flow which is really<br>absolutely phenomenal right and and to<br>me what that means is that so the next<br>promise of biochemistry is the promise<br>the ability to go in and sort Tinker<br>with the system right so you can Tinker<br>with the system to improve crop yields<br>you can Tinker with the system to get<br>the biofuels that we need and the<br>hydrogen that we need and the butanol<br>that we need and so that's going to be<br>happening over time now and so we're<br>going to be looking forward uh for from<br>new insights from you and new insights<br>from your students and um starting out<br>with a 78 million people that are going<br>to be added on this year we're going to<br>need you to succeed so we're counting on<br>you to succeed um so that's just and and<br>we<br>expected um so I want to end up really<br>by thanking you so thank you for that<br>really really neat lecture and I also<br>want to thank you for the years of<br>service that you've given to the<br>department in terms of not only the<br>outstanding research but all the<br>teaching and service and on a personal<br>level I want to thank you for serving as<br>um my Deputy hod for the last four years<br>and for being a colleague and and and a<br>good friend over the last eight years<br>and we have a small token from the the<br>department and the school and the<br>division and the university that we'd<br>like to present you with so if you'd<br>come</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
