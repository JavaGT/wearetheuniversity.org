Chancellor here at the<br>University of itago and as alwayss it is<br>my great pleasure to welcome staff and<br>students from the University and members<br>of the general public who have joined<br>with us today in the celebration of not<br>the promotion of a new professor but<br>actually the recruitment of a new<br>professor Professor um it provides the<br>opportunity for the University of itago<br>many of us um to have the the first<br>opportunity to publicly welcome<br>Professor Michael lauff um to the<br>University of itago he's recently joined<br>us from Texas A&amp;M<br>University now at the University of<br>itago we are extremely proud of the high<br>proportion of our academic staff who<br>like our new professor that we're<br>welcoming today actually hail from<br>somewhere else uh in fact in fact the<br>University of itago has the highest<br>concentration of international staff of<br>any New Zealand University and we have<br>the fifth highest concentration of<br>internationally trained staff in the<br>world now this reminds me of a quote um<br>by a very famous uh New Zealand<br>physicist the late Sir Paul Callahan<br>whose dream was to make New Zealand a<br>place where Talent wants to live and I<br>think at itago we have really achieved<br>uh Sur Paul's dream we are certainly de<br>delighted to welcome um this new<br>extremely talented individual um and his<br>family to join us here at the University<br>of itago and we hope that it is a place<br>that they do want to<br>live um I would now like to invite the<br>hod of philosophy Professor Alex Miller<br>um to tell us a little bit more about<br>Michael's academic journey to this<br>world<br>okay I should um just like to to begin<br>by expressing the Department's gratitude<br>in particular to cut on a net buyer um<br>whose generosity makes the the buyer<br>chair in early modern philosophy um a<br>possibility and and also thank the<br>university for um making that<br>possibility an actual State of<br>Affairs um I had a look on the on the<br>internet<br>um this afternoon just trying to see if<br>there were any other universities that<br>have got dedicated chairs in early<br>modern philosophy and I found lots of<br>pictures of philosophers that did early<br>modern philosophy and lots of pictures<br>of of of Dead Philosophers as as well um<br>but I couldn't actually find a um find<br>another institution that had a a chair<br>like this um so it's a especially<br>important I think for us that we've got<br>some as um special and and talented as<br>professor<br>laou professor laou grew up in<br>Washington DC and Los Angeles um did his<br>undergraduate degree at Princeton<br>University before doing a a PhD in the<br>history of philosophy at University of<br>California San Diego<br>thereafter between 2000 and<br>2013 Professor lauff was teaching at<br>Texas A&amp;M University and in 2010<br>published his monograph from bondage to<br>Freedom Spinosa on Human Excellence um<br>study of Spinoza's ethics and that<br>monograph is been favorably reviewed in<br>most of the leading philosophy journals<br>um in in the world<br>in addition to the to the monograph um<br>Professor lauff has published not only<br>in the very best generalist journals in<br>the world such as the philosophical<br>review he's also published in the best<br>specialist history of philosophy<br>journals and in very prestigious venues<br>like the Cambridge companion to spot's<br>ethics should stress that although<br>Professor Lau is interested in the<br>history of philosophy he's interested<br>not so much in the history of um the<br>great figures but in what contribution<br>they can make to helping us tackle<br>certain current and enduring<br>philosophical problems such as moral<br>obligation Consciousness virtue the role<br>of the passions and moral psychology and<br>the nature of<br>perception uh although Professor lauff<br>is a specialist on Spinosa um tonight<br>he's going to talk about another<br>philosopher Thomas Hobbs and he's going<br>to talk about the central political<br>argument in hobbsy philosophy and<br>attempt to make that relevant to some<br>contemporary philosophical concerns so<br>I'll hand over at this point to<br>Professor<br>Lao thanks very much Alex thanks for<br>me um<br>I'm uh just so uh overwhelmingly glad to<br>uh to be here um uh I admired uh the<br>University of otago and deden and New<br>Zealand from afar for many months while<br>I was um hoping to have the chance to uh<br>work here and um since my family and I<br>have come to uh the University of otago<br>um everything that um I had hoped I<br>would find here uh and more we have<br>found we're uh just uh so happy to be<br>here and so proud to be part of um what<br>I really think is um the best uh<br>institution um uh that I could find uh I<br>don't think there's a better place to be<br>in the world uh than here um sorry to my<br>daughters if I sound too much like Ernie<br>McMillan but I want to express my<br>pride um before I begin I'd like to um<br>offer a few uh particular<br>acknowledgements I'd like to thank Lisa<br>Ellis for um all of her help and support<br>um and for teaching me so much about<br>Hobs um like to thank my daughters Susie<br>and Allison for uh making the long<br>journey um my colleagues in the<br>department of philosophy um thank you<br>for your confidence uh and thank you for<br>your hospitality U it's been a very easy<br>transition it doesn't seem like um<br>7,837 miles um it's been um a very uh<br>enjoyable<br>move um I'd like to thank harleen Hayne<br>and Richard Blakey and Brian malne all<br>of whom did such a good job of telling<br>me what was important about um otago<br>when I came to visit um I was of course<br>um very nervous and trying to win a job<br>um but an interview is a two-way process<br>and um it was uh really a very enjoyable<br>and um it was the right sort of process<br>it okay so um let's turn to uh the<br>material for tonight um what I want to<br>do is to sell you a pocket Hobs um<br>what's a pocket Hobs it's the sort of<br>Hobs that you carry into a cocktail<br>party the sort of Hobs that you remember<br>um the sort of one that you read about<br>in the editorial Pages um or in<br>introductory<br>turns out that among early modern<br>philosophers Hogs is one of the few who<br>remains relevant to uh enormous number<br>of people enormous variety of ways um<br>and you hear references to Hobbs um in<br>just a whole bunch of different places<br>uh as soon as I mentioned to uh Greg do<br>that I was interested in the pocket Hobs<br>um he immediately said oh did you know<br>that New Zealand's uh leading security<br>expert has said that we engaged in a<br>Hobs and bargain about internet security<br>so I looked saw Ian Fletcher's speech in<br>Wellington last Wednesday where he<br>talked about our our Hoban bargain you<br>also find pocket Hobbs is um referred to<br>in just a wide variety of academic<br>disciplines so rational Choice Theory<br>social psychology international<br>relations um and of course political<br>science which Hobs claimed to have<br>philosophy um okay so that's what a poet<br>Hobs is it's a short paragraph you have<br>two candidates at the top of your of<br>your handout for a pocket Hobs the<br>villain today is the back pocket Hobs<br>and my hero is the Hip Pocket Hobs the<br>cool Hip Pocket Hobs that I'll be<br>defending um let me start though by<br>raising an objection against the very<br>idea of a pocket Hobs this is a sort of<br>objection that um in wearing one of my<br>usual hats I would Raise Myself the from<br>a passionate student of the history of<br>philosophy um look you can't you can't<br>do this to Hobs<br>uh Hobbs wrote um 20 volumes dense in uh<br>English and Latin on a variety of<br>subjects um he's one of the um Great<br>Master rhetoricians of English I rank<br>him just above Melville and just behind<br>Elliot in my masters of English Pros<br>he's he's a top five English Pros writer<br>um and that makes him subtle uh and he's<br>full of Express contradictions um and<br>it's really hard we'll see um just how<br>hard he is in a few minutes when I uh<br>introduce some<br>passages um I brought a prop um this is<br>leviathan um and the pocket Hobs as you<br>have are just a one paragraph summary of<br>this um the library wouldn't let me take<br>out the other 15 volumes of hobbs'<br>collected works so I brought them in<br>but<br>um okay so there's the objection it's<br>too it's too tall in order to ask for a<br>one paragraph summary of a uh of a great<br>early modern<br>philosopher um my response is um well it<br>can be uh if there's something of um<br>enduring value in someone who's been<br>dead for 300 years and his ideas if they<br>keep popping up from time to time um in<br>a variety of ways um that's a mark of of<br>the importance of the figure um and it's<br>something that um makes history of<br>philosophy<br>worthwhile<br>um so I<br>mean we're not going to aim for um a<br>complete correct interpretation of Hobbs<br>tonight that is too much to ask but if<br>we can generate a good Hip Pocket Hobbs<br>if we can capture the kernel of hobbs'<br>political argument that bit of it that<br>really has uring value that's useful in<br>a wide variety of circumstances that<br>seems to me to be something worth<br>doing okay<br>um so um in the response to the uh<br>objection from the passionate student I<br>think I've been able to come up with a<br>few criteria for un for uh understanding<br>judging the various pocket Hobs that we<br>have tonight um just um just two<br>criteria and I'll spend most of my time<br>tonight on the first right um so if<br>we're going to have a pocket Hobs first<br>we have to capture the kernel of hobbs'<br>thought we have to get Hobs right okay<br>um and second that pocket hubs that we<br>generate has to be<br>useful okay I won't spend very much time<br>on usefulness because I find I get um<br>Tangled Up people start to disagree too<br>much when we talk about what's useful<br>but um in a few concluding remarks I'll<br>talk about how I take uh the pocket Hobs<br>The Hip Pocket Hobs to be<br>useful um okay so let's get to work um<br>introducing the pocket<br>Hobs um and then I'll make the case for<br>The Hip Pocket Hobs let's start with the<br>back pocket Hobs should be um familiar<br>to many of you who studied Hobs um in<br>undergraduate classroom as I say in a<br>variety of<br>courses um so Hobs is a radical<br>individualist the individual psychology<br>for the back pocket Hobs is based on an<br>account of Desire the back pocket hob<br>says everyone desires his or her own<br>preservation so I desire My preservation<br>you desire yours and it's the same with<br>everybody that makes us look somewhat<br>the same um but notice that there's an<br>important difference um I desire to<br>preserve me and you desire to preserve<br>you and that means that we can conflict<br>right um and because our needs are so<br>similar um that possibility is very real<br>right um if there's only one goat um and<br>I need the goat and you need the goat<br>conflict seems pretty<br>likely um hob says conflict is<br>inevitable um he talks about the<br>rationality of Discord at least he does<br>according to the back pocket Hobs with<br>no government over us um we're bound<br>because we live near each other because<br>things are scarce because each of us<br>knows that the other can do physical<br>harm um we're bound to be in a state of<br>war known violence all the time there's<br>the uh the war of all against all the<br>famous chapter 13 Leviathan<br>War um how do we get out of it well<br>fortunately we aren't stuck with nature<br>we can do something artificial what we<br>do is we create an artificial man<br>someone who's just like us who desires<br>to preserve himself but who's made up of<br>all of our collected power we submit to<br>this man that we create the Leviathan um<br>and once the Leviathan is there um the<br>rationality of Discord disappears<br>because the Leviathan is so powerful<br>such a threat to any of us that there's<br>no longer any sort of equality right if<br>the Leviathan says to do something then<br>the threat that Leviathan poses is such<br>that I'm just going to do it and what he<br>tells us to do is is cooperate and Obey<br>and so we<br>do um and that's really the whole back<br>pocket HS if you create um something<br>that um really has a monopoly of the<br>power of Liberty and life um you're<br>going to get<br>peace<br>okay um so I think the back pocket Hobs<br>is all wrong and I'm going to argue<br>about about that tonight um I prefer the<br>new cool Hip Pocket Hobs um and I think<br>I'm the only only one that that's what<br>um let me um let me um advertise The Hip<br>Pocket Hobs and then um get into um the<br>textual argument to see which one<br>represents the colonel of hobbs' thought<br>better on the Hip Pocket Hobs we also<br>start with radical individualism and the<br>individual psychology but we start a<br>step further back we talk about the<br>human passions that give rise to desire<br>rather than desire itself and The Hip<br>Pocket hob says fear is what motivates<br>people um the problem is um that the<br>things that we fear vary dramatically<br>notably um we either fear death or we<br>fear invisible<br>Powers um so at a given time different<br>people will fear different things and<br>over a given over a given life um I<br>myself will fear one day death another<br>day invisible powers and it's not<br>predictable to me what you're fearing<br>just now and similarly it's not<br>predictable to you it's very hard for us<br>to keep any Bargains it's very hard for<br>you to depend even upon my obedience um<br>because we don't know what it is that's<br>motivating each other at a given moment<br>so um there's also a war of all Against<br>All In The Hip Pocket Hobs but the war<br>doesn't arise from any sort of known<br>rationality of Discord it arises from<br>sheer unpredictability we're unable to<br>make any bargains<br>um I can't even tell what you think is<br>in your interest because I don't know<br>what you think the invisible powers are<br>commanding you to<br>do well if we thought the first state of<br>nature was difficult to get out of this<br>one seems even more pressing right how<br>is it ever going to work um I suppose we<br>could get Super Lucky and have everyone<br>in a given place at the same time um all<br>happen to fear death at the right moment<br>at the same moment um if that were to<br>happen then the back pocket Hobs would<br>go through we could submit to a<br>sovereign and create a leviathan but man<br>that would be super lucky right um much<br>more likely France is going to come and<br>Conquer us right so we're so<br>disorganized and Powerless it's much<br>more likely that a leviathan already<br>existing is going to come to us from the<br>outside and impose Order gain our<br>submission by<br>force um well if it were to happen how<br>lucky would that be that would be great<br>because the war of all install is a<br>miserable<br>State um so it would be a great thing if<br>by some sort of sheer good luck a<br>leviathan should come and rule over<br>us um for the back pocket Hobs as<br>Leviathan to maintain order all it needs<br>is a monopoly on power over Liberty and<br>life since all we fear is death um what<br>advice does the does the Hip Pocket Hobs<br>Sovereign get it's a great thing to have<br>a leviathan in charge how do we um keep<br>control after all people's motives are<br>changing all the time<br>the advice that the Hip Pocket Hobs<br>gives to the Sovereign is take advantage<br>of that same plasticity of human passion<br>that caused such a problem in the war of<br>all against all people flop back and<br>forth all the time about which objects<br>they fear if you can take advantage of<br>that and make sure that the fear of<br>death and the fear of powers invisible<br>motivate the same kinds of actions<br>command the same sorts of things then<br>you can get lasting peace then it won't<br>matter what a subject fears on a day if<br>God say says to do the same thing that<br>the king says um then everyone will obey<br>the<br>law okay so the advice to The Sovereign<br>is much more complex in the in the Hip<br>Pocket Hobs but there it<br>is okay so I've laid out the positions<br>let me go um to the first of our<br>criteria the colonel of hobbs' thought<br>who's going to win since I assume that<br>um some of you are firm adherence of the<br>back pocket Hobs which you've lovingly<br>thought dbed through from time to time<br>for the last 20 years where's Charles<br>um I want to start by trying to loosen<br>resistance to to it I think it'll be um<br>an exercise that won't be wasted because<br>I think we're going to see that the way<br>the back pocket Hobs fails is pretty<br>much um the way the Hip Pocket Hobs<br>succeed so it will be a nice<br>introduction to the advantages of The<br>Hip Pocket Hobs as<br>well so one problem with the back pocket<br>Hobs is that whereas Hobs is really<br>concerned with fragility of Commonwealth<br>the back pocket Hobs makes peace<br>inevitable it's hard to avoid peace<br>right um so let's look to the first<br>three passages on uh the handout um<br>these are all prominent and and for Hobs<br>relatively clear passages in the review<br>and conclusion he says no man ought to<br>be ignorant of the laws of nature we all<br>know what they are we all know what they<br>command the second passage um from<br>chapter 15 Hobs characterizes the laws<br>of nature as dictates of Reason about<br>what conduces to conservation and<br>defense so um there are some dictates of<br>Reason uh about what conduces to<br>conservation defense that no one is<br>ignorant of we all know them um one of<br>them is the second law of nature it says<br>um everybody knows um that in order to<br>defin themselves they ought to submit to<br>the rule of<br>Leviathan okay um it just follows if you<br>take the back pocket hobbs' version of<br>individual psychology that because we<br>all seek to preserve ourselves we're<br>we're all going to follow the known<br>means to peace right we all just will<br>follow the second law of Nature and<br>submit to a sovereign and will generate<br>a leviathan and if something should<br>happen by some Chance some Civil War<br>some regicide France some<br>problem um we're all just going to pick<br>up the pieces and start<br>again um when you have that accounts of<br>Desire peace seems very hard to avoid<br>but that's not Hobs<br>um Hobbs lived during the time of the<br>English Civil War his greatest concern<br>was that peace is very hard to get right<br>um at the end of chapter 20 Hobbs writes<br>when or where has there been a kingdom<br>long free from sedition in Civil War<br>just the opposite of what you would<br>expect him to say if the back pocket<br>Hobs were<br>um Leviathan seems like um a necessary<br>condition on peace for the back pocket<br>Hobs but it comes very close to being<br>sufficient for peace um and<br>uh I think that that's um<br>misinterpreting Hobbs he spends a lot of<br>time think about the notion of an<br>artificial man um what do men do we get<br>sick and die and hob spends a lot of<br>time talking about the diseases that<br>face Commonwealth and the way that<br>commonwealths can die right um the<br>Leviathan of the back pocket Hobs seems<br>to be immortal it's a different kind<br>it's not the greatest creature under God<br>it's just<br>God okay so there's the first problem<br>the back pocket Hobs makes peace<br>inevitable um the second the back pocket<br>Hobs ignores religion and Society all<br>together I don't think someone writing<br>during the time of English Civil War<br>would hold a view on which he ignores<br>religion and Society altogether it<br>simply doesn't end the back pocket Hobs<br>right we're trying to capture<br>Leviathan this is the part of Leviathan<br>that's about religion and<br>Society<br>um I'll offer a lot uh a lot more<br>textual evidence when I get to the Hip<br>Pocket Hobs about the importance of<br>religion it's what Springs from the fear<br>of power<br>invisible um but um to be brief chapters<br>612 29 and 32-47 of Leviathan are about<br>religion and society and a short<br>encapsulated version of hubs that<br>doesn't include them seems to get things<br>wrong okay um these two problems I've<br>named are<br>related right why is it that peace is<br>really hard to come by for hops<br>um because religion is such a potent<br>force in society people fear power is<br>invisible the most the Civil Sovereign<br>can do is threaten death if your motive<br>is something for which death doesn't<br>matter at all you're not going to care<br>what the Civil Sovereign asks you to do<br>you're going to disobey<br>and fully half of our motives of most<br>powerful motives are of that<br>kind okay so um The Hip Pocket Hobs gets<br>things right just where the back pocket<br>Hobs gets things wrong let me turn now<br>to The Hip Pocket<br>Hobs<br>um the beginning and end of The Hip<br>Pocket Hobs at the beginning we have the<br>problem posed by the plasticity of um<br>human uh emotion sometimes we Fe fear<br>death sometimes we fear poers invisible<br>um at the end we have the advice to The<br>Sovereign if you want good subjects make<br>sure that different kinds of fear<br>motivate the same kinds of action um<br>passages four and five on the handout<br>address just these points um and they're<br>very prominent and important passages<br>the introduction to Leviathan Hobbs<br>formulates his entire um psychological<br>method of introspection on the basis of<br>the first one whoever looks into himself<br>and considers what he does he shall<br>thereby read and know what are the<br>thoughts and passions of all other men<br>upon the like occasions I say the<br>Solitude of passions which are the same<br>in all men desire fear hope Etc not the<br>Solitude of the objects of the passions<br>which are the things desired feared and<br>hoped um these these we can't know so<br>there's the plasticity of emotion um in<br>the end of the review and conclusion the<br>end of Leviathan we get an account of<br>what the really good citizen is hobs um<br>devoted uh dedicated Leviathan to the<br>memory of of one of his friends Sydney<br>galphin and he describes gulin as the<br>very best citizen there can be um and in<br>terms which show that the reason galphin<br>is a good citizen is that although he<br>had the same passions that all everyone<br>has the passions have the right objects<br>so here's Hobs praising G<br>Dophin nor is there any repugnancy<br>between fearing the laws and not fearing<br>a Public Enemy nor between abstaining<br>from injury and pardoning it in others<br>there is therefore no such inconsistence<br>in human nature with civil duties as<br>some think right human nature is plastic<br>enough that we can bring a human being<br>to be a good<br>citizen I have known clearness of<br>judgment en largess of fancy strength of<br>reason and graceful elocution a courage<br>for the war and a fear for the laws and<br>all imminently in one man and that was<br>my Noble and honored friend Sydney<br>galphin he had his passions in<br>line um and then I have a long quibbling<br>paper of 50 pages about whether he<br>brought in line himself or whether he<br>was born that way the point is a human<br>being can come to be this way right and<br>so what a sovereign should do is work on<br>citizens to bring them uh to be like<br>Sydney galin to um be brave in the face<br>laws okay um another emphasis uh in uh<br>The Hip Pocket Hobs is emphasis on fear<br>and its<br>varieties now the back pocket Hobs likes<br>fear too its fear of death that gives<br>rise to a desire for life and um<br>Advocates of the back pocket hubs<br>frequently quote a passage from<br>Leviathan chapter 14 The Passage to be<br>reckoned upon is<br>fear um but they don't quote the whole<br>thing um for good reason because the<br>whole thing supports the Hip Pocket hops<br>the passion bre aond is fear whereof<br>there are two very general objects one<br>the power of spirits invisible the other<br>the power of those men they shall<br>therein offend of these two though the<br>former be the greater power yet the fear<br>of the latter is commonly the greater<br>fear okay um so there are two great<br>kinds of fear um and one of them is a<br>fear of powers<br>invisible according to the Hip Pocket<br>Hobs it's this fear the fear of power<br>power invisible that's the greatest<br>threat to an existing Sovereign right so<br>um once a sovereign is in power what's<br>going to cause the artificial man to get<br>sick and die citizens motivated by the<br>fear of power is invisible um passages<br>seven and8 I think um show<br>this uh first from hobb's initial<br>account of the things that tend uh to<br>um cause uh problems among human<br>passions uh fear of things invisible is<br>the natural seed of that which everyone<br>in himself calleth religion and in them<br>worship or fear that power otherwise<br>than they do<br>Superstition and this seed of religion<br>having been observed by many some of<br>those that have observed it have been<br>inclined thereby to nourish dress and<br>form it into laws um so one of the big<br>problems with with religion is that it<br>gives rise to obedience you can bring<br>other people to obey and that's supposed<br>to be the cival Civil sovereigns job<br>right okay um and then uh in chapter 29<br>much later um when Hobbs is um worried<br>about um the end of a commonwealth um he<br>gives his initial account of um really I<br>think that this is uh Catholicism his<br>his principal um worry uh in the 17th<br>century England<br>1650 um and here you see the full-blown<br>competing uh source of authority uh in a<br>state as there have been doctors that<br>hold there be three souls in a man so<br>there be also that think there may be<br>more souls that is more sovereigns than<br>one in a commonwealth and set up a<br>Supremacy against the sovereignty<br>cannons against laws and a ghostly<br>Authority against the Civil working on<br>men's Minds with words and distinctions<br>that of themselves signify nothing but<br>beray by their obscurity that there<br>walketh as some think invisibly another<br>kingdom as it were a kingdom of fairies<br>passage um so here's the threat to the<br>Sovereign um if you have someone else<br>urging obedience and that someone else<br>Works upon a different motive that's<br>also a common human motive you're going<br>to have Discord in a in a uh<br>State okay um according to the Hip<br>Pocket Hobs the advice that we give to<br>The Sovereign is well make sure that<br>these two motives lead to the same sorts<br>of actions um I take the second half of<br>Leviathan to be Hobs working on<br>sovereigns of Good Will and subjects of<br>Goodwill who recognize what a precious<br>thing peace is and want to work to save<br>it um what he wants to do is he wants to<br>um<br>bring his readers who are mostly<br>Christians of one variety or another to<br>see that the proper ecclesiastical<br>Authority is the same as the proper<br>civil Authority right um so part as I<br>read it part three of Leviathan is a<br>general argument for that thesis and<br>part four is an argument against the<br>principal opponent which is the Catholic<br>Church okay um so here are two passages<br>from the second half of Leviathan um<br>chapter 9 um this is supposed to<br>describe the Great threat posed um by um<br>the mistake of not recognizing that the<br>Civil Sovereign is the same uh as the uh<br>Christian Sovereign for when Christian<br>men take not the Civil Sovereign for<br>God's Prophet they must either take<br>their own dreams for the prophecy they<br>mean to be governed by and the tumor of<br>their own hearts for the spirit of God<br>or they must suffer themselves to be led<br>by some strange Prince or by some of<br>their fellow subjects that can bewitch<br>them by slander of the government into<br>Rebellion without other Miracle to<br>conform their calling than sometimes in<br>extraordinary success and<br>impunity and this and by this means<br>destroying all laws both Divine and<br>human reduce all order government and<br>Society to the first chaos of violence<br>in Civil War if you admit that there's a<br>sovereign different from the Civil<br>Sovereign you invite<br>chaos and then from chapter 4 um where<br>he addresses the main abuse of scripture<br>this is um uh directed at the Catholic<br>Church specifically as I as I read<br>hubs the greatest domain abuse of<br>scripture to which almost all the rest<br>are either consequent or subservient is<br>the resting of it to prove that the<br>kingdom of God mentioned so often in the<br>scripture is the present church this<br>power Regal under Christ being<br>challenged universally by the pope and<br>in particular commonwealths by<br>Assemblies of the pastors of the place<br>when the scripture gives it to none but<br>to civil sovereigns comes to be so<br>passionately disputed that it puts out<br>the light of Nature and causes so great<br>a darkness in men's understanding that<br>they see not who who it is to whom they<br>have engaged their obedience they don't<br>they don't recognize the Civil Sovereign<br>anymore okay um so uh those are the<br>passages I think confirm the various<br>details of the Hip Pocket Hobs and make<br>it a better candidate than the back<br>pocket hubs for our um for our pocket<br>Hobs um but I think that Hobs is most<br>general characterizations of his own<br>project do the same thing um so these<br>are supposed to be just very general<br>indications that the hit pocket hubs has<br>it right in the review conclusion hubs<br>say says as to the whole Doctrine I see<br>not yet but the principles of it are<br>true and proper and the rasassination<br>solid for I grounded the Civil Right of<br>sovereigns and both the duty and Liberty<br>of subjects upon the known natural<br>inclinations of mankind D D D D D uh and<br>I ground the power ecclesiastical of the<br>same Sovereign on such texts as are both<br>evident in themselves and consonant with<br>the whole of scripture so he has a<br>two-part project he wants to show um<br>first that there's a civil right of<br>sovereigns and second that the very same<br>sovereigns hold ecclesiastical right<br>those are the two halves and my last<br>text is just the title of the book which<br>I think the back pocket Hobs ought to<br>have<br>read Leviathan or the matter form and<br>power of a commonwealth ecclesiastical<br>and<br>civil um there is um religion right<br>there in the title of<br>Leviathan okay um so that wraps up um my<br>case uh that the Hip Pocket hubs meets<br>the first Criterion better than the back<br>pocket Hobs I think that there are<br>Central passages in Leviathan that show<br>that The Hip Pocket Hobs is um the right<br>one it might still be the case that you<br>find the back pocket Hobs more useful um<br>let me just say very quickly um why I<br>think the Hip Pocket Hobs is more useful<br>um boiled down I think um for the back<br>pocket Hobs civil power is the principal<br>means to peace in a society um uh<br>looking at Ian Fletcher's speech last<br>Wednesday he says the people of New<br>Zealand have struck a Hoban bargain with<br>respect to the internet if you want<br>better behavior on the internet you need<br>to give us more power to scrutinize<br>people's behavior and you need to give<br>us more power to enforce penalties for<br>bad behavior right um I think he has the<br>the back pocket Hobs right um this is<br>this is how you get peace for the back<br>pock po ET<br>Hobs The Hip Pocket Hobs does ask for<br>absolute civil power as much as the back<br>pocket Hobs does but the main point of<br>The Hip Pocket Hobs is somewhat<br>different what it says is even absolute<br>civil power is not sufficient for<br>peace right um so in a given situation<br>where you have um Lawless chaotic<br>Behavior The Hip Pocket hob says well<br>there are two ideals to work towards<br>right there a variety of human motives<br>that are involved um in this bad<br>behavior um and it may be better not to<br>increase civil power necessarily um you<br>want both if you can get it um probably<br>both civil power and full ecclesiastical<br>power be sufficient for peace um<br>but it may be counterproductive even um<br>to ask for more civil power in a given<br>situation<br>um tip bucket hubs is hard on religion<br>um I don't think that all of our<br>religious motives are based in fear of<br>poers invisible um maybe some of them<br>are um but the main point I think that<br>we can take from The Hip Pocket Hobs<br>with respect to its its um account of<br>motivation is just that the Civil<br>Authority has the ability to motivate us<br>only in very limited ways we think that<br>the fear of death and wounds is a pretty<br>important fear uh and so the power over<br>the lives of subjects is a major power<br>but all of us are motivated by some<br>motives for which death doesn't really<br>matter that much right um and The Hip<br>Pocket hubs has a particular nominee the<br>U religious motives fear of invisible<br>Powers um but I think it's enough for us<br>to just take the lesson that um we're<br>complex sometimes Fearless persons and<br>it's very hard uh to gain peace just by<br>the threat of death and<br>you okay uh I just like to say thank you<br>to um Michael for such a such a a<br>substantial and interesting lecture um<br>although Michael was speaking about Hobs<br>um is I guess his main specialization of<br>spot or so looking for some comments I<br>could make after this talk I went and<br>had a look around and I looked in ber<br>and Russell's history of Western<br>philosophy and the Very opening of the<br>chapter on Spinosa he says that Spinosa<br>is the noblest and most lovable of men<br>well I like Mike a lot but I don't think<br>I can go that far um especially<br>especially on camera um but I would like<br>to say that I there's a great tradition<br>of work in the history of philosophy at<br>atago so in the past we've had such<br>notable figures as DD<br>Raphael um John Passmore and JL Mai<br>working on um largely on topics on the<br>on the British side of of the English<br>Channel and it's good now that we're<br>branching out to to the other side of<br>the of the channel and um one final uh<br>comment I'll make is that um spinza and<br>his day was was actually regarded as a<br>heretic he was he was banished from the<br>the Jewish community in Amsterdam um and<br>one distinguishing feature of the<br>philosophy Department in AAG was that<br>we've actually had a professor of<br>philosophy who was tried for hery in<br>1886 and it's something that the<br>Department's immensely proud of um you<br>know so we're glad to have a have a<br>Spinosa expert um amongst our midst um<br>I'll give this to professor lauff and uh<br>at the same time say to everybody that<br>there's um Refreshments across in the<br>staff Club afterwards to which everybody<br>thanks</p></main><footer
