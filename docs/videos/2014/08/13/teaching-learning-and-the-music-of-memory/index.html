I'm not Haren<br>hay in case you thought I was I'm Vernon<br>Squire I'm the deputy Vice Chancellor<br>academic International uh harling<br>couldn't make it tonight and apologizes<br>for that so welcome to staff to students<br>and to visitors um we always like to see<br>a few visitors here as well as um the<br>staff on<br>campus inaugural professorial lectures<br>are very special events in my<br>calendar and it's the opportunity to<br>celebrate the success of some of our top<br>Scholars tonight's lecture is no<br>exception it applauds Professor Robin<br>for the Excellence of his<br>scholarship and I want to talk a little<br>bit about how we measure that<br>scholarship in the path to being given a<br>personal chair at this<br>University a Targo is quite unique in<br>the way it<br>assesses promotion to professor as<br>sustained outstanding<br>leadership and competence has to be<br>demonstrated in two out of three areas<br>the three areas are research including<br>professional practice teaching including<br>curriculum<br>development service including local<br>National and international<br>service and you have to get sustained<br>high performance in the other area so we<br>do actually ask quite a<br>lot I'm drawing your attention to four<br>things in what I've just said<br>the word outstanding competence which<br>suggests a very high level of<br>Excellence the word<br>leadership demonstrating<br>influence<br>impact moving the subject<br>on the word sustained meaning that we<br>expect<br>outstanding for the Long<br>Haul and the fact that the we demand<br>evidence-based all round performance<br>universities and if that wasn't enough<br>three separate<br>application with an independent<br>International assessor expressing their<br>view as well so the process is pretty<br>robust and the number of Staff we get<br>through that are relatively small so<br>you've made it mate as<br>say tonight Professor Robbins will only<br>have time to just tell us a little bit<br>about his considerable scholarship<br>scholarship that is especially<br>persuasive in teaching and learning<br>innovation in fact award-winning in<br>teaching and learning Innovation I now<br>pass to Professor Keith Hunter who's the<br>proce chancellor of Sciences to<br>introduce Anthony with a brief biography<br>K everybody and thank you<br>Vernon um and it's my pleasure again to<br>uh introduce another of our inaugural<br>Professor lecturers from Sciences I<br>believe it's about 10 this year um and<br>it's always a pleasure to do this<br>Anthony's originally from Christ Church<br>and he completed a BSC honors degree in<br>Psychology at um University of<br>Canterbury in<br>1984 um as a result of which he was<br>fortunate enough to win a commonwealth<br>scholarship he had a few months<br>backpacking around Asia and India and<br>then he took the scholarship up at the<br>University of Sussex in the UK in 1985<br>where he then completed an Ma and defil<br>in cognitive science in 1989 he came to<br>atago as a new blood lecturer in a joint<br>appointment between the Departments of<br>of computer science and uh psychology<br>both in of course in sciences and after<br>that three-year appointment he took up a<br>full-time position in computer science<br>where he is uh<br>today in his teaching Anthony has<br>focused on the primary first year paper<br>in computer science which he has taught<br>since<br>1991 uh he's also been very active in<br>teaching Robotics and programming in<br>schools and organizing both the regional<br>and National versions of the robocup<br>Junior competition which attracts<br>hundreds of school children's every year<br>he was also recently involved in writing<br>the new computer programming related NCA<br>assessment standards for use in the new<br>new digital technology curriculum in New<br>Zealand high schools in 2012 he was<br>awarded both an atago teaching<br>Excellence award and a national tertiary<br>teaching Excellence award and these are<br>not common and um we all joined Anthony<br>at the time and congratulating him on<br>that very fine<br>distinction Anthony's um very interested<br>in teaching evaluations and he's been<br>doing them in his first year teaching<br>since<br>1991 so he tells me as a result of that<br>he's collected quite a library of<br>student feedback and comments most of<br>them positive otherwise he wouldn't have<br>got his teaching award but some of them<br>quite creatively<br>unflattering his favorite comment so far<br>far is Dr robens is a lovely man with a<br>sense so all joking aside um Anthony I<br>congratulate you on your finally<br>deserved uh promotion to professor and<br>invite you to present your inaugural<br>Professor<br>lecture it's true I have aing dress<br>sense<br>Academia was probably the only career<br>path open to<br>me thank you Vernon thank you Keith for<br>your introductions thank you all for<br>turning out I very much appreciate uh<br>you<br>coming nobody who stands up here to do<br>an IPL got here by themselves and I<br>would like to extend my very sincere<br>thanks to all those who are virtually<br>standing here with me uh the University<br>of otago and the computer science<br>department have been wonderful employers<br>and wonderful places to work I'd like to<br>thank my heads of Department uh past and<br>present they've always supported me in<br>everything I've ever wanted to<br>do I'd like to thank my teaching<br>colleagues in particular Sandy gner who<br>uh I have worked with on various<br>teaching projects over the last 15 years<br>I want to thank the HC who were helpful<br>to me in the early years of me learning<br>the craft of teaching uh and I'd like to<br>thank uh in particular krie Shepard who<br>is here from the<br>HC um who advised me and encouraged me<br>to apply for this teaching award and who<br>advised me uh throughout the<br>process thank you to my research<br>colleagues that I've shared the various<br>research adventures with I've enjoyed<br>working with all of you and I've learned<br>much from all of<br>you not least uh thank you to my friends<br>and family uh thank you thank you Tosha<br>my parents are in Christ Church and my<br>mother wasn't well enough to travel uh<br>but thanks to the audio visual folks mom<br>and dad will watch this on mom's iPad<br>later hi<br>guys um let's start with a question five<br>minutes walk from where I live is this<br>pole does anyone know what this pole is<br>and where it<br>is I hear some mumbling it's by crusty<br>corner at the entrance to Northeast<br>Valley and if you're passing stop and<br>read the plaque at the bottom it's the<br>last remaining Edwardian Tramway Pole<br>from the electric Tramway system that<br>was uh operating in theen from 1903 till<br>1956 my grandfather was a driver on the<br>trams and this is his<br>Satchel uh and I still use it this is my<br>satel for carrying all my lecture stuff<br>it's with me now because before this I<br>was I was just at a lecture I'm going to<br>pack my satel here for a moment its<br>significance will become apparent I<br>think every talk of this nature should<br>contain an inspiration quote from a<br>classical<br>author I frequently don't know what I'm<br>doing and I have to organize myself<br>carefully and right from the start I had<br>a filing system based around obvious<br>categories of teaching research<br>Administration when I grew up a bit and<br>became useful I learned to call<br>Administration service and then there<br>were remaining bits and pieces which<br>were just to do with me there's my<br>tram I like to think that my<br>grandfather's briefcase is still going<br>to work on trams in the need and just a<br>different kind of tram remember that<br>tram uh because we'll be back to it uh<br>at the end now this talk has a broad<br>mandate a lot of ipls focus on Research<br>my background and my application for<br>promotion was based more on teaching and<br>service so I'm going to spend a lot of<br>time talking about research because what<br>academic doesn't like doing that uh but<br>I also am going to try and save some<br>time at the end to talk about teaching<br>and service matters but let's start by<br>talking about the the M the me uh in<br>case anyone is in any danger of taking<br>Professor Robbins too seriously I'd like<br>to show you a picture of the last time I<br>regalia dress since we've done that<br>part um what else can we conclude from<br>this picture well we can conclude that<br>if this was the last time I wore regalia<br>I'm not doing my duty at otago's<br>graduation ceremonies and I would like<br>to hereby promise the university that<br>I'm going men my ways in that<br>respect another thing that we can<br>conclude is that this me and this me are<br>not the same they're different versions<br>of me uh they have different strengths<br>and weaknesses and almost as many<br>differences as similarities but one of<br>the things that does connect them uh<br>does connect us is memory I remember my<br>grandfather and I remember being this<br>strange young man too I'm fascinated by<br>memory I'm fascinated by people but I'm<br>fascinated by memory in particular and<br>that's been the subject of of my<br>studies I focus on some quite low-level<br>mechanisms and questions what is a<br>memory and how are memor stored and<br>retrieved and here we're all working<br>within the foundation established by a<br>neuroscientist called Hebb in<br>1949 a cognitive event something that we<br>experience is a pattern of activity in<br>the brain it's certain nerve cells<br>certain neurons in the brain firing<br>being active and when we perceive<br>something a certain pattern of activity<br>is established<br>and when we remember something that same<br>pattern of activity is recreated I<br>perceive the dog I pattern I remember<br>the dog something like it the same<br>pattern is<br>recreated now the first thing we need to<br>say about this is that it works nothing<br>like a tape<br>recorder a tape recorder when it<br>remembers a piece of music it makes a<br>physically translated copy of that music<br>if you like and it stores it in a place<br>in a location and memory and when it<br>wants to recall that piece of music you<br>can go to that location and memory and<br>get it back there it is you just<br>translate it again human memory Works<br>nothing like this human memory in<br>musical terms is much more like an<br>orchestra an orchestra doesn't access a<br>piece of music from a location an<br>orchestra recreates a piece of music uh<br>it it reconstructs it there's nowhere in<br>the orchestra that that piece of music<br>is stored uh the whole Orchestra has to<br>participate in reconstructing it human<br>memory is much more like an orchestra<br>than a tape recorder it's a process of<br>reconstruction and it's therefore<br>unreliable so this is taking place in<br>the brain and the brain is made up of<br>nerve cells neurons and they're<br>connected together and the connections<br>between them are called synapses it's<br>about 100 billion nerve cells in the<br>average brain and almost a a trillion<br>trillions of of<br>synapses these synapses these<br>connections are very important because<br>they have a site of learning the brain<br>learns by by adjusting the strengths of<br>the connections between nerve cells so<br>that some patterns cause other patterns<br>of things to happen and these<br>connections can be positive excitatory<br>red hot type connections or they can be<br>inhibitory um cooling connections um<br>where one uh unit will will shut another<br>uh a nerve cell down with inhibitory<br>connections so these configurations of<br>connections encode the patterns that the<br>brain uh can can recreate I think of<br>these configurations of connections as<br>being like a musical score the musical<br>score is information that the orchestra<br>of the brain uses to recreate its<br>memories its pieces of music uh and the<br>configurations of connections of the<br>strengths of the connections between our<br>nerve cells is the information that the<br>brain uses to recreate the patterns of<br>memory uh in the same way so I'm going<br>to build up a series of conclusions as<br>we go and this first conclusion is the<br>accepted wisdom it's the starting place<br>the patterns of memory are not accessed<br>from a store they are recreated as<br>they're needed from these configurations<br>of connection weights in the<br>brain now I'm a computer scientist and<br>nobody gives me real brains to play with<br>I have to work with simulations called<br>artificial neural networks this is the<br>whole idea of simulation using a<br>computer to create a simulation of<br>another world we can create complete<br>worlds uh the worlds of games are very<br>complete and immersive and lots of our<br>young people spend a whole lot of time<br>there these days uh we can create<br>simulations of weather systems to make<br>predictions about weather I create<br>simulations of very small bits of brain<br>function relating to<br>memory so remember my brain nerve cells<br>neurons that fire or don't fire and are<br>connected by configurations of uh<br>weights a standard diagram of an<br>individual nerve cell will usually look<br>a lot like this uh the cell body<br>receives inputs from other cells which<br>activate it or shut it down and this<br>cell either files or it doesn't and it<br>makes outputs to other cells the<br>computational abstraction of this that<br>we work with is an artificial unit and<br>this unit can be inactive in which case<br>it's state is zero or it can be active<br>in which case its state is one uh so I'm<br>representing those as open and filled<br>circles uh in my in my diagrams what<br>tells a unit to be on or off is its<br>input<br>this is input from another unit and if<br>it's active it's one time the weight<br>plus one time the weight maybe zero<br>times that weight and we add up all<br>these inputs that's the total input to<br>the artificial unit and then if that<br>unit is positive we'll switch on if that<br>input is positive will switch on and if<br>that input is negative we'll switch<br>off so we can take these units very<br>simple computational elements like this<br>and connect them together into any kind<br>of patented Network that we like<br>and here I've got a network that I want<br>to examine more<br>closely so to store patterns of<br>activation to store memories in these<br>networks we need to adjust the weights<br>we need to set weights that will help us<br>recreate the patterns and here we've got<br>a particular pattern and you'll see that<br>the weights between the active units the<br>units that are on are all excitatory<br>they're all positive uh units that fire<br>together wire together is is hebb's<br>description and the connections to the<br>inactive units are all negative they're<br>all inhibitory I'm only showing a few of<br>the possible connections here in general<br>terms every unit could be connected to<br>every other unit uh it doesn't really<br>matter but we can use these<br>configurations of weights to encode<br>patterns some patterns are stable this<br>pattern is stable because every unit<br>that's receiving positive input is on<br>and every unit that's receiving negative<br>input is off this is an unstable pattern<br>because this unit is on when it's<br>receiving negative input from the other<br>active units and this unit is off when<br>it's receiving only hot positive input<br>from the other units so these units are<br>in the wrong State and next time we<br>update the network uh they'll switch uh<br>and unstable patterns will therefore<br>converge they'll return to stable ones<br>in other words stable patterns what they<br>do is they complete or correct<br>themselves uh and this is the process of<br>recall<br>so let's have a look at an artificial<br>neural network which has learned a bunch<br>of patterns it's learned the pattern<br>representing the digit six uh in which<br>case the units will be configured in<br>this state these units will be on to<br>encode that pattern and it's been taught<br>other patterns too the digit n the digit<br>2 the digit zero and so on uh this<br>network has learned a bunch of patterns<br>now the purpose of learning is to make<br>these desired patterns stable to make<br>them the stable patterns of the the<br>network so that if we get an input which<br>is a a a distortion of one of the stable<br>patterns a version of one of the stable<br>patterns it will complete and correct<br>itself in the way that I showed you<br>before uh so that the units receiving<br>positive input switch on and the<br>negative one switch off and that pattern<br>corrects itself and converges on one of<br>the stable patterns so the purpose of<br>learning is to make the desired pattern<br>stable we can think of is creating a<br>basin of attraction in the same way that<br>mass creates a sort of a gravitational<br>attractor that pulls in other Mass so<br>stable patterns create a basin of<br>attraction that pulls in unstable<br>patterns this pattern is stable and it<br>will pull in this unstable pattern this<br>unstable input will complete itself and<br>Converge on this learned one and this<br>unstable pattern which is a corrupted<br>version of the input will con Converge<br>on one of the stable learn states of the<br>system so we call the set of unstable<br>patterns that converges on a stable one<br>the Basin of Attraction and it's like a<br>gravitational field sucking in unstable<br>patterns uh from<br>nearby the purpose of learning overall<br>is to create a useful State space a<br>useful set of attractors so that the<br>patterns that we want to learn are<br>stable and so that they suck in unstable<br>patterns uh from nearby if we look at<br>that little set of patterns that I just<br>learned before the digits uh they all<br>have attractors around them uh that<br>Gather in the other unstable patterns<br>now this all is all very nice in terms<br>of models of memory this has the<br>properties of being what they call<br>content addressable we can use a part of<br>a memory to recall the whole it's robust<br>to noise and damage uh which is what we<br>want a memory system to be but it has a<br>major problem and the major problem is<br>is that when we learn these patterns and<br>make them stable a whole bunch of other<br>patterns become stable in the<br>network some of these stable patterns<br>look a bit like distorted versions of<br>stuff we learned and some of them just<br>seem to be completely random there's no<br>way to prevent this the process of<br>learning some patterns and making them<br>stable creates this huge population of<br>unstable patterns and they all have<br>their own attractors and there doesn't<br>seem to be any way of telling them apart<br>based on their tractors the tractors are<br>the same size the same steepness the<br>same depth um the state space created by<br>learning is is hugely complicated but we<br>can't tell real memories from false ones<br>we can't look at a pattern like that one<br>and know whether it was one that we<br>learned or whether it is one uh that is<br>spurious so this is a real problem for<br>models of memory it can't tell fact from<br>fiction it really doesn't know uh what's<br>true if we were to look at that St State<br>space from above look down on it think<br>of it as being like ripples on a pool<br>these ripples of the attractors and at<br>the center of each Ripple there's a<br>learned stable pattern and looking at<br>them we can't tell which are the real<br>ones and which are the spous imaginary<br>ones created by the interactions uh of<br>the Learned ones this is a visual image<br>that I'm going to get back to so<br>remember that underneath these<br>attractors are the connections the<br>configurations of connection that create<br>the patterns the configurations of<br>connections encode the patterns uh the<br>patterns of<br>memory so part of my research has been<br>on trying to solve this problem on<br>trying to tell the the real pattern from<br>the spous ones uh and I made some<br>progress with this by looking beyond the<br>patterns of activations themselves<br>here's a pattern of activation which<br>might be stable in the network looking<br>at it I don't know if it's a real memory<br>or a false one but but instead of just<br>looking at the activation I can look at<br>the inputs the input term which is<br>causing the activation if the input is<br>positive the unit is switching on and<br>that's the black circles and if the<br>total input to the current unit is<br>negative the unit is switching off and<br>that's the Open<br>Circles what's important about the<br>magnitude of the input is it's its<br>distance from the threshold this unit is<br>off but it's only just off because its<br>input is only just away from the<br>threshold this input is on but its input<br>is very large it's a long way from the<br>threshold so inputs that are close to<br>the threshold are<br>unstable and inputs which are far from<br>the threshold are stable if all we care<br>about is stability then we can flip<br>those inputs consider them all as as<br>positive things and then if we arrange<br>them into order what we get is a<br>stability profile a map of how stable<br>the units of the this pattern are and it<br>turns out I got lucky stability profiles<br>let me tell the difference between<br>learned and stable patterns patterns<br>that we've learned are kind of<br>flattish their features are all more<br>equally stable than spous patterns<br>spurious patterns have these steep<br>profiles and in particular they have a<br>cluster of Highly stable units at the<br>top and a long tail of unstable units<br>that they drag with them and it's<br>interesting to wonder whether the<br>various kinds of spous human memories<br>false memories delusions and so on<br>whether they have this property of of<br>having a a superstable core of very uh<br>strong features uh bringing along with<br>them a long kind of tail of much weaker<br>less certain features as part of the<br>pattern so using these stability<br>profiles I can now have a technique<br>which can tell the difference between<br>learned and unlearned state St states of<br>the system all of these Furious ones the<br>ones I didn't learn have a steep profile<br>and all of the ones I really did learn<br>have a much flatter profile so I can<br>tell the difference there's a final<br>little bit of this<br>story uh which is that not all unlearned<br>patents are necessarily bad we all<br>organize the world in terms of natural<br>categories like person and chair and<br>table and<br>bird categories have structure and they<br>have prototypes they have Central<br>average members as the average bird none<br>of us ever see the average bird it<br>doesn't exist in the real world but it<br>exists at the center of our category of<br>bird so a prototype is like a kind of a<br>super learned pattern but it's unreal in<br>the sense that we never actually meet it<br>in the in the real world the prediction<br>you'd want the system to make about<br>prototypes is they should be super<br>learned patterns and it makes the<br>correct prediction their profile is is<br>flattish which makes sense because all<br>the features of a prototype are kind of<br>average they're not extreme ones they're<br>average that's why they're in the<br>Prototype so to my conclusions that I'm<br>going to build up I'm going to add this<br>conclusion memories recreated patterns<br>might be prototypes they might be real<br>or they might be spurious patterns uh<br>and we can now tell the difference using<br>these stability profiles the bits where<br>I think I can make a particular<br>contribution of the bits in Red so<br>that's the first kind of mini topic<br>here's another mini topic on forgetting<br>and how to fix it because these art<br>official neural network models have a<br>problem they're all limited to the world<br>of concurrent learning we have to learn<br>all the patterns that we want to learn<br>in one session they're presented one at<br>a time to the network and that's called<br>an Epoch and we might need tens or<br>thousands of epochs while these patterns<br>negotiate on a set of Weights that works<br>for all of them they negotiate on a set<br>of Weights that make all the Learned<br>patterns<br>stable that is not very realistic to<br>have to do all your learning at once and<br>then say that learning is finished and<br>you can never do any learning again<br>that's completely unrealistic we as<br>humans learn throughout our lives<br>something today something tomorrow<br>something next week what we want is<br>serial ongoing lifelong learning and<br>most neural networks can't do it because<br>they're limited to this concurrent<br>process if you try and do serial<br>learning with a neural network what<br>happens is you you learn this base<br>population in the usual way a set of<br>patterns and then you add a new pattern<br>like the digit eight this time and you<br>can learn that pattern completely<br>successfully but it'll wipe out<br>everything you knew before this is<br>called catastrophic forgetting it's like<br>our Orchestra of memory learns a single<br>new piece it forgets all the pieces that<br>it knew before this is just a disaster<br>in terms of models of memory uh what's<br>happening here is that the new attractor<br>is pushing all the other attractors out<br>of the space taking over completely and<br>the state space is getting completely<br>distorted so what can we do about this<br>one of the things we can do is a process<br>called<br>rehearsal uh when we learn the new item<br>we can relearn some of the old items and<br>that protects the old items it kind of<br>nails their attractives in place and the<br>new attractive for the the new pattern<br>that we're trying to learn is forced to<br>fit around uh the ones that were already<br>there it works but it's unsatisfying<br>it's unrealistic because<br>what sort of memory is it that needs to<br>be protected by having everything that<br>has been learned before continuously<br>available for relearning uh the<br>orchestra of memory every time it learns<br>a new piece doesn't want to have to<br>relearn every piece that it previously<br>learned um so this this is a working<br>solution but not a satisfying one I was<br>fortunate enough to uh invent a method<br>which I called pseudo rehearsal which is<br>similar in the sense that it involves<br>when we learn something new<br>relearning old things but those old<br>things don't have to be real patterns<br>they can be random samples of the<br>Network's Behavior now what these random<br>samples are varies from Network to<br>network but in the case of the networks<br>that we're looking at here these can be<br>random attractors you can choose any old<br>attractor and in fact it doesn't matter<br>if all the attractors you choose are<br>spurious not the Learned ones at all<br>when you learn the new item it is still<br>forced to fit in with existing<br>attractors it's like the state space of<br>memory becomes sluggish and reluctant to<br>change because of this random process<br>and the new pattern gets fit in amongst<br>the old ones without disturbing them and<br>we can do that without needing to access<br>the old patterns at all just by randomly<br>sampling the Network's<br>Behavior this works just as well as real<br>rehearsal and it became the standard<br>solution to the catastrophic forgetting<br>problem uh in the in the field and and<br>my probably my most successful<br>contribution in this in this area so to<br>the set of conclusions that we're<br>building up let's add another one to<br>successfully merge new learning into<br>long-term memory without forgetting<br>requires a process of active maintenance<br>we memory doesn't just sit there if<br>we're doing new learning we've got to<br>help it along with a process of active<br>maintenance uh but this process can be<br>based on random stimulation I've never<br>wor one of these in a lecture before<br>they're not they're not ideal I'm just<br>saying<br>requires a process based on uh active<br>maintenance and this thing can use<br>random stimulation it can be based on<br>random statistical<br>processes so the orchestra of our memory<br>is maybe too formal and structured a<br>kind of analogy we want musicians that<br>do a lot of improvisation a lot of<br>random stuff uh we want a jazz band of<br>memory uh maybe this jazz band who are<br>vamping it up all the time while they're<br>learning new stuff and that's enough to<br>protect their old memories<br>what does sleep Evolution and dreaming<br>have to do with this picture I hear you<br>cry and I'm I'm so glad you asked it's a<br>mystery actually as to why we sleep<br>sleep is very strange because for a<br>third of Our Lives we shut down we<br>switch off our senses we switch off our<br>cognition we're vulnerable to Predators<br>it's a strange thing to do there are<br>many theories as to why we sleep and the<br>one that I'm interested in is that sleep<br>is a period within which we consolidate<br>learning there's lot of evidence for<br>this if you deprive someone of sleep<br>they're learning shot uh if you learn<br>lots of new stuff during the day then<br>you require more sleep in certain phases<br>of sleep so I believe this story that<br>sleep is a a phase where we consolidate<br>learning it seems to be a two-stage<br>process there's a structure deep within<br>the brain called the hippocampus where<br>new learning builds up during the day<br>and in case there are any<br>neuroscientists here present uh I need<br>to have some footnotes there but but but<br>let's just accept that there's some uh<br>new learning stored in the hippocampus<br>during the day and during sleep the<br>hippocampus has a dialogue with the<br>cortex the seat of long-term memory and<br>the new learning is transferred into our<br>long-term memory that's a two-stage<br>process which is a bit odd but what's<br>even odder is that while this is going<br>on from deep within the brain stem the<br>oldest part of the brain random<br>stimulation is being generated and it's<br>bombarding the cortex at the same time<br>as this new learning is being<br>transferred now that's a bit of a<br>mystery why are we cluttering up new<br>learning with random bombardment why the<br>complex two-stage process why the random<br>inputs pseudo rehearsal the process I<br>discovered in artificial neural networks<br>where learning a new item has to be<br>buffered by random stimulation random<br>samples of the network behavior in order<br>to protect old learning I think this<br>random bombardment that goes on during<br>sleep is the brain's solution to the<br>catastrophic forgetting problem the<br>sleeping brain is trying to integrate<br>new learning with long-term memory and<br>to do that it requires this random<br>sampling of the existing memories uh in<br>order to get uh the job<br>done you can trace this back in<br>evolutionary history and you can see<br>that the hippocampus and complex sleep<br>that I've just described in the mamalian<br>brain you trace it back into primitive<br>sleep in simpler organisms like birds<br>and um reptiles and all the way back to<br>the simplest nervous systems that are<br>capable of learning things like<br>crustations and so on their learned<br>changes are maintained by a process that<br>biologists call Dynamic stabilization<br>their nervous system inhibits its own<br>outputs and then randomly bombards<br>itself uh and this is the process by<br>which learning is maintained and you can<br>trace that through up to what's going on<br>in our brains while we sleep and the use<br>of this random stimulation while we<br>completely inhibit our outputs and go<br>into this comos state of sleep and<br>dreaming so I think the pseudo rehearsal<br>story that works in artificial neural<br>networks is also what's happening in the<br>brain and I think there's both<br>experimental and evolutionary evidence<br>uh that supports this so to my<br>conclusions my last conclusion was that<br>um new learning uh required a process of<br>active maintenance I want to now extend<br>that conclusion slightly and say that<br>the brain has in fact evolved such a<br>thing and that H it happens during sleep<br>and it's based on random stimulation and<br>that we experience it at least in part<br>uh as as dreaming the musicians of our<br>memory uh do their best learning while<br>they're asleep and every student who's<br>swatting for exams should get plenty of<br>sleep to consolidate their new learning<br>instead of being these sleep deprived<br>caffeine fuel<br>autometer that they are what is<br>maintained there's a process of active<br>maintenance but what is it that is<br>maintained traditionally it would have<br>been assumed that that it's these<br>patterns of connection weights it's<br>these positive and negative excitatory<br>and<br>inhibitory configurations of Connections<br>in the brain that must be maintained<br>they encode Memories We preserve<br>memories so we must be preserving<br>these I don't think it's the case<br>certainly in my neural network models if<br>I learn a base population to low error<br>the weights are in a certain<br>configuration if I keep learning new<br>stuff 40 new items in a sequence with<br>some sort of rehearsal or pseudo<br>rehearsal process I can keep the error<br>low I can learn successfully without<br>forgetting but the weights change a lot<br>this is the correlation of the weights<br>with their starting point by the end of<br>learning 40 new items the correlation is<br>only3 which is weak we've preserved the<br>memories but to do that the weights had<br>to rearrange themselves a lot they had<br>to find ways of recoding themselves the<br>stability of memories doesn't depend on<br>the stability of the weights that<br>encodes them it depends I think on<br>exactly the opposite it depends on the<br>the patterns of memory recoding<br>themselves in new configurations of<br>Weights that make room uh for the new<br>learning there's some experimental<br>evidence which relates to this which is<br>from the lab of Cliff Abraham and the<br>site Department here uh Cliff is a world<br>expert on the mechanisms of learning and<br>if you have a rat uh and you stimulate<br>it with an artificial learning event<br>there's um no way we can observe real<br>learning events in the brain yet but if<br>you apply uh an artificial electrical<br>stimulus high frequency stimulation you<br>can observe increases and connection<br>strengths these red dots that I've been<br>using and these increases and connection<br>strengths are persistent uh they last a<br>long time 40 days in this study and this<br>is the source of the idea that they<br>permanent encoding of<br>memory uh but there are situations in<br>which those weights those increases are<br>not permanent if the animal does further<br>learning uh an enriched environment if<br>the animal is put in an environment<br>which is fun to explore and do more<br>learning then the weight changes that<br>were created aren't stable at all they<br>disappear and the question is does is<br>this catastrophic forgetting has the has<br>the animal forgotten stuff and what I<br>think um the neural network evidence<br>suggests is is no that memories can be<br>preserved even if weights are being<br>rearranged uh underneath them so to my<br>conclusions uh I'm going to add the<br>following this process of active<br>maintenance doesn't maintain connection<br>weights for things that create patterns<br>it maintains the overall uh State space<br>the overall patterns and state space of<br>memory not the connection weights<br>themselves if I was going to go out on a<br>limb I'd suggest that while we're awake<br>the configurations of Weights in the<br>brain create the patterns of memory but<br>while we're asleep random processes<br>preserve the patterns of memory while<br>the configurations of Weights rearrange<br>themselves underneath I think that<br>memory patterns and the connection<br>weights that encode them actually encode<br>each other in an interactive uh process<br>if you like the the patterns of memory<br>the state space of memory and the<br>connection weights that encode it they<br>have a dialogue in which they kind of<br>re-encode each other and the whole<br>system is much more complicated and much<br>more fluid in fact uh than you might uh<br>you might<br>expect that's the end of my sequence on<br>uh research relating to artificial<br>neural networks of models of memory want<br>to spend the remaining time talking<br>about some aspects of teaching and<br>service both of my children are<br>currently uh students here at the<br>University of ago uh and one of my very<br>great joys in life is watching their<br>emergence uh as scholars in their own<br>right I'm loving it experienced through<br>their eyes otago is a place of teaching<br>and learning uh and I think there are<br>lots of unsung heroes of teaching in<br>this place in all sorts of positions uh<br>and I salute them all the unsung heroes<br>of<br>teaching a lot of my teaching has<br>involved this paper comp 160 the<br>Department's introductory programming<br>paper which I have taught since 1991<br>against the advice of senior colleagues<br>when I started long retired so I can say<br>this of them who told me that first year<br>teaching was um career suicide death to<br>research and I should stay away from it<br>this is not true this is not true at all<br>I've Loved teaching uh this 100 level<br>paper and a lot of my research is now<br>devoted to it to Computer Science<br>Education<br>Topics in 1991 the computer on my desk<br>was an apple uh Apple Mac plus four<br>megabytes of ram these days it's an iMac<br>a fantastically powerful and complicated<br>machine other aspects of Technology have<br>changed just as fast from printed copies<br>of the encyclopedia britanica to<br>Wikipedia and the wonders of the<br>worldwide web all of this modern<br>technology depends on computer programs<br>it's all made to work because of<br>computer programs and that's what comp<br>160 is about we learned the programming<br>language<br>Java the essence of that doesn't change<br>because computational descriptions of a<br>process is what programming is all about<br>but the edges of it change with the<br>changing technology and that means it's<br>always an interesting topic to stay on<br>top of uh and to teach a lot of my<br>involvement with the course has to do<br>with issues of teaching and<br>learning uh and I can situate these in<br>the context of this fairly well-known<br>quote from the literature all teachers<br>of programming find that their results<br>the outcomes in the course display a<br>double hump in other words these courses<br>have a shockingly high fail rate it's<br>really horribly High uh internationally<br>over decades over countries 30 to 60% of<br>students fail first year programming but<br>that's not the whole story because a<br>large group also do really really well<br>they get excellent grades this is the<br>double hump the outcomes in programming<br>courses are more polarized than outcomes<br>in any other course uh that I know of<br>this is true also in my paper in comp<br>160 I'd certainly agree with this the<br>quote goes on it is as if there are two<br>populations those who can and those uh<br>who<br>cannot uh each with its own independent<br>bell curve some people go so far as to<br>speculate about the existence of a<br>programmer Gene it's just genetically<br>determined you can program or you can't<br>um I do not believe this I think this is<br>false I think the solution to this<br>polarizing effect comes in the<br>well-known pedagogical principle that we<br>learn at the edges of what we know and I<br>think different domains of knowledge<br>have different kinds of edges and<br>programming languages are very<br>complicated and structured it's like<br>assembling a jigsaw the edges matter a<br>lot and you can't ignore them and you<br>can't get them wrong and if the process<br>of assembling the jigsaw goes well you<br>make good progress good outcome but if<br>you lose it if the jigsaw goes off<br>course there's almost no way to recover<br>and we're at the end of the<br>spectrum I I most of my research just<br>lately has been in computer science<br>education topics related to this idea we<br>learn at the edges of what we know the<br>quote continues none of it works and uh<br>whatever we try none of it works and the<br>double HT persists I want to query that<br>too it's a work in progress but we're<br>trying to get that fail rate in comp 160<br>down uh got a a PhD student working with<br>me on that project at the moment also<br>involving ker from HDC comp 160 runs in<br>January in summer school why not come<br>along and see what all the fuss is about<br>I'd love to have<br>you<br>robocap<br>robocap I was frustrated by the poor<br>offerings that were available relating<br>to programs in the school curriculum<br>relating to programming in the school<br>curriculum it's really pretty diabolical<br>you could learn to use Word and Excel<br>and stuff but there wasn't any fun stuff<br>relating to programming so in about 2005<br>I started a robotics programming Club at<br>Logan Park High School these days the<br>students come to us we've got a a a<br>robot lab in the department uh I run an<br>after school club on Wednesdays Sandy<br>runs after school clubs most other days<br>of the week and the students come along<br>and they build Lego robots and they test<br>Lego robots and they program Lego robots<br>uh and if if the university knew quite<br>how many hours it had paid me to play<br>with Lego I think theyd take they'd take<br>my promotion away<br>but it's teaching and learning and it's<br>a fun way of getting kids involved with<br>programming it's not just the clubs lots<br>of the schools now have these<br>programming clubs it feeds into an<br>annual competition uh which happens both<br>regionally and nationally this is the<br>Hatton theater in uh June June or<br>July was I think it was June this year<br>150 record<br>150 students participating in robocup<br>from the all of schools here are their<br>parents kept safely behind the barriers<br>looking on and there are three events uh<br>there's the uh Performance Event the<br>theater event here we see Tobias as<br>Doctor Who confronting a DC uh while uh<br>these robots perform there dance on the<br>Dance Floor my friend Brahman here<br>insisted that I have a dancing robot in<br>the talk uh but I've got a photo of the<br>dancing robot but that's that's all<br>lurking above the Dick's um plunger of<br>Doom uh you can see uh me I'm the Chief<br>organizing judge lurking in the<br>background by my judging laptop so both<br>Sandy and I particularly Sandy very<br>involved in organizing this competition<br>there's the theater there's the search<br>and rescue where you have to navigate<br>this uh Maze and you have to locate the<br>rescue victim and in some versions of<br>the event locate it and pick it up and<br>place it on the rescue platform and then<br>there's a robotic soccer which I I hope<br>is fairly self-explanatory we have teams<br>of two robots an attacker and a def<br>Ender and they chase around after this<br>ball which emits pulse infrared light<br>and they have sensors to find it they<br>try and score goals you can see these<br>guys are are pretty into the game at the<br>moment they're having a wonderful time<br>uh it's a very dramatic<br>moment so they come along and they have<br>fun and they win their prizes and they<br>go home happy but what's behind it all<br>is that they're learning the program<br>because they have to learn to program to<br>make these robots do stuff so this is<br>our vehicle for uh involving hundreds of<br>students every year all around the<br>country in programming related<br>activities one more topic the last in<br>the<br>talk I never expected to end up doing<br>anything in schools Beyond<br>um Beyond this robotic stuff uh but I<br>got involved in ncea standards there's a<br>big debate all around the world as to<br>when to teach programming to kids in<br>schools New Zealand died and dithered<br>and dithered uh but when they decided to<br>act they they acted very quickly and in<br>2009 and 10 they planned big changes to<br>the digital technology curriculum they<br>introduced new assessment standards at<br>NCA the school qualification and these<br>were introduced at what we would have<br>called most of us here I think fifth<br>form sixth form and seventh form in<br>20112 and uh currently being introduced<br>in year 13 so there are these new<br>programming standards and there were<br>some problems with the initial drafts of<br>these standards and a group of the<br>needen teachers recruited Sandy and I<br>and we threshed out some modifications<br>uh this has work with um Mary Gil and<br>Julie<br>mcmah and we presented these suggestions<br>to the Ministry of Education and they<br>said right would you please come up and<br>write some new standards uh so I went to<br>various meetings around the country and<br>we threshed out new Computing NCA<br>standards and they're documents that<br>looked like this and they specify the<br>attributes that student work has to have<br>to meet various criteria a working uh<br>achieving uh solution achievement with<br>Merit and achievement uh with Excellence<br>this is actually fish difficult to<br>describe criteria for assessing programs<br>in within this framework the framework<br>of these NCA standards is is very tight<br>it's very regulated uh and it's<br>difficult to construct descriptions of<br>programs uh that work uh with within<br>them nonetheless we did our best and we<br>wrote these five new programming related<br>standards uh and they're in use all<br>around New Zealand and thousands of<br>students are are doing them<br>currently as a result of participating<br>in this process we realized what a huge<br>task it was that school teachers had<br>ahead of them in gearing up for this<br>most technology teachers uh don't know<br>anything about programming and now they<br>find themselves in the position of<br>trying to teach it so again Sandy and I<br>and this is by far mostly s's work we<br>decided to create<br>workbooks uh to support exercises and<br>provide resources for teachers and these<br>are Big documents well over 100 Pages<br>here in a year 12 workbooks and we wrote<br>them in in two different programming<br>languages Java and python which was a<br>bit of a challenge because neither of us<br>spoke python we had to learn it to do<br>that uh but these have been very well<br>received in schools they're in use in uh<br>110 schools around the country we think<br>they're being used uh by almost all of<br>the schools that are actually actively<br>teaching the standards uh so we've got<br>these resources out there uh I've been<br>involved in other activities some<br>professional development seminars funded<br>and organized by Google where I go along<br>and talk to teachers and I'm currently<br>in negotiation with the<br>um uh with the College of Education here<br>about creating uh a distance taught<br>paper for teachers to try and provide<br>more professional development we really<br>want this curriculum change a big<br>important curriculum change to be<br>successful and we're trying to get in<br>behind it so this is an aspect of I<br>don't know is a service is this teaching<br>uh I don't know but it's it's something<br>that that I'm doing a very useful<br>transition in the curriculum uh several<br>thousand students around the country<br>doing these standards 110 or more of the<br>schools are using our resources and<br>overall a huge challenge for teachers uh<br>that should have been better resourced I<br>would love to see education in general<br>better resourced<br>um education it's not the shortterm<br>solution to anything so it gets a bit of<br>political neglect but it's it's the<br>long-term solution to everything uh and<br>I would like to see more going into<br>education that's it we're done we're<br>back where we started and there's<br>nothing left to reflect on except where<br>to from here when I retire it is my plan<br>to go off the rails<br>until such happy time as I contemplate<br>the past present and the future of my<br>academic career I want to leave you with<br>a short<br>poem there once was a man who said damn<br>it has borne in upon me that I am an<br>engine that moves in predestinate<br>tram<br>thank you very much Anthony for a really<br>inspiring talk um so going it I'm<br>michaeel Albert I'm the head of<br>Department of computer science and so<br>it's my happy duty to thank Anthony for<br>his for his presentation and um I guess<br>I want to work backwards through it in<br>some sense and uh starting with the the<br>service aspects that he spoke about um<br>I'm a relative new boy in the computer<br>science department and so it's been of<br>great value for me to me to have such uh<br>experienced heads and wise heads around<br>as anon's to help out and one of the<br>things about Anthony in particular with<br>regards to service responsibilities is<br>that I know that whenever I absolutely<br>need something done and I absolutely<br>can't think of who might do it well<br>Anthony will typically say yes now<br>there's a littleit bit of a caveat that<br>comes to with that it's that you know if<br>you have a<br>deadline um it might not happen just<br>before the deadline but it'll usually<br>happen not too long after the deadline<br>so you need to take these things into<br>into account but no in in all<br>seriousness um anony is a hugely valued<br>member of the department and has<br>contributed an enormous amount both to<br>our internal operations and as he's<br>spoken about to our relationships with<br>the with the wider Community both within<br>deden through the individual schools and<br>across New Zealand through the<br>curriculum<br>developments um in that context I was<br>actually a meeting earlier today with<br>Anthony with the um people from the uh<br>Institute of it professionals who run a<br>program in schools called ICT connect<br>where they uh do presentations in<br>schools trying to convince students to<br>think about it careers um and you know<br>between moments Anthony and I were just<br>chatting about the um uh professorial<br>lecture and um he promised faith F that<br>he was going to stand up here and<br>implode okay so so now I've planted a<br>furious memory in your<br>head and you can all take that away with<br>you from the<br>talk but<br>finally I saw not a bit of pseudo<br>rehearsal going on during Anthony's talk<br>uh so I can I can think I can truthfully<br>say I think we were all very well<br>entertained and informed by his talk and<br>thank him very much for his his<br>inaugural professorial lecture and give<br>him a small token of appreciation from<br>the<br>University</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
