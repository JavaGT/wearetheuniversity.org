automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening my name is harleen hayne<br>and i'm the vice chancellor here at the<br>university of otago and on behalf of the<br>university i would like to warmly<br>welcome you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>as i say many times at the beginning of<br>these lectures the rise to professors<br>through the ranks at the university of<br>otago is not an easy one<br>we are extraordinarily hard on our own<br>so when one of our own makes it to the<br>point of professor it is truly a time<br>for celebration so tonight is really<br>about celebrating the success of<br>professor perry gilford<br>i would like to warmly welcome the staff<br>and the students from the university of<br>otago who are here in the audience this<br>evening as well as members of the<br>general public<br>who often take advantage of these<br>fantastic opportunities to listen to the<br>brilliance that is a university of otago<br>professor<br>i would also like to warmly welcome<br>perry's family and friends who i know<br>some of whom have traveled quite a long<br>distance to be with us here this evening<br>because they like us know how special<br>this occasion really is<br>now those of you who know me well<br>will know that since i have become the<br>vice chancellor i will talk to just<br>about anyone who will listen about the<br>university of otago<br>now on a regular basis i speak to<br>ministers officials<br>visitors to the university<br>prospective students parents and just<br>random people on the street who will<br>stop long enough to listen to me talk<br>about this fine institution<br>and sometimes when i catch myself<br>bragging about the fantastic things that<br>go on here i start to wonder whether or<br>not i've become a bit of a used car<br>salesman<br>and i really wonder is there any<br>substance to the message that i keep<br>saying over and over again<br>but my fears of insecurity disappear on<br>nights like this<br>professor perry guilford personifies<br>what is great about the university of<br>otago<br>he is not only a brilliant researcher<br>but the research that he has conducted<br>here has literally visibly and truly<br>saved people's lives<br>less than 10 years after he completed<br>his phd professor guilford made a<br>remarkable discovery about the genetic<br>contribution to stomach cancer in a<br>northern e-way<br>his discovery has led to screening and<br>intervention that has meant the<br>difference between life and death for<br>literally dozens of individuals<br>now i don't know about the rest of you<br>but what i have achieved in my career<br>does not hold a candle to that kind of<br>contribution i am extremely proud that<br>professor gilford has chosen to make<br>otago his intellectual home<br>so i would personally like to thank you<br>perry for keeping me honest<br>and for reminding me that the research<br>that we do here is not only world class<br>but it is also extremely valuable<br>i would like to warmly congratulate you<br>on your achievement to professorship and<br>i would now like to call on pat craig<br>the deputy dean of the otago school of<br>medical sciences who's going to tell us<br>just a little bit more about your<br>it obviously gives me a really great<br>pleasure to be able to introduce um<br>parry guilford to you<br>the otago school of medical science is<br>a school with five departments in it and<br>parry is from the department of<br>biochemistry and so that is why i as<br>acting dean are giving this introductory<br>talk<br>and i've been given the brief to give<br>you a brief biographical sketch so<br>starting with his academic career<br>he did his bsc in biochemistry at otago<br>university in 1981 and stayed on to do<br>an msc in 1983.<br>he then moved out of the university to<br>become a scientist with the dsir<br>in the plant diseases division and he<br>was there for three years and that<br>resulted in three publications in the<br>journal of general virology and he was<br>interested in those days in white clover<br>mosaic virus<br>he then went to p to do a phd at the<br>university of cambridge<br>and that was between 1987 and 1991<br>and he continued there with his interest<br>in plants and the topic of his thesis<br>was a molecular analysis of tobacco<br>rattle virus and its rna one and from<br>that he achieved two publications in the<br>journal that was called virology<br>and then he returned to new zealand as a<br>scientist again with the dsir this time<br>in plant protection and he was there<br>between 1989 and 1991<br>and published<br>three times in virology again back on<br>the theme of white clover mosaic virus<br>his next step was a real major step he<br>secured a postdoctoral fellowship at the<br>human molecular genetics unit at the<br>pasta institute in paris<br>and he was there between 1991 and 1994<br>and there he<br>first started working on the genes<br>responsible for human deafness<br>and he published there in nature<br>genetics the human molecular genetics<br>and also in nature<br>the nature paper was actually not on<br>deafness as such it was on the usher<br>syndrome where he was involved in a team<br>cloning the gene responsible for this<br>sensory deficit syndrome<br>as far as the deafness human deafness<br>team was concerned he led it and it was<br>his responsibility with his team<br>to localize the first two genes for the<br>recessive<br>non-syndromic deafness and this is<br>actually amazing because at that time<br>it was considered that the genetic<br>heterogeneity of this condition was such<br>that it would completely preclude the<br>identification of a such genes<br>but we now know that mutations in one of<br>these deafness genes<br>account for the majority of the cases of<br>human deafness<br>so his six publications from that<br>postdoctoral time were very significant<br>in his career<br>he returned to new zealand<br>and worked then as a scientist at hort<br>research cri in auckland<br>between 1994 and 1996<br>and he switched then to looking at<br>microsatellites and the male and female<br>linkage maps in apples<br>and published<br>in the theoretical and applied genetics<br>journal<br>at that point<br>he saw the light<br>returned to the university of otago<br>and rejoined the department of<br>biochemistry and he was appointed as a<br>research fellow on a two-year lottery<br>health grant followed by a three-year<br>hrc project grant with tony reeve as the<br>pi<br>and the purpose of those two grants was<br>to identify a stomach cancer<br>susceptibility gene<br>those two grants and the work with tony<br>reeve led to<br>at least four publications<br>one of which was in nature<br>and it was entitled e catering mutations<br>in the familial gastric cancer<br>parry was first author tony reeve was<br>last author<br>and this is the work<br>that harleen alluded to with the large<br>maori family<br>it identified the first known gene for<br>inher inherited gastric cancer<br>and as harleen said it led directly to<br>the dramatic improvement in clinical<br>management of gastric<br>familiar<br>families worldwide<br>it was also cited by the united nations<br>as a model for the intervention between<br>geneticists and indigenous families<br>that are affected by inherited<br>disorders the interaction between the<br>geneticists and the indigenous families<br>was the linchpin to make this work<br>during<br>the this 1996 to 2001 period<br>parry also worked with tony reeve on<br>colorectal cancer and with mike eckles<br>on the absolute absence of pax 2 gene<br>mutations in patients<br>with primary familial viso visokuretic<br>reflux<br>at that point in 1999 parry was promoted<br>to senior research fellow<br>but in august 2001<br>he elected to leave the department of<br>biochemistry<br>to become the co-founder of pacific edge<br>biotechnology<br>and<br>since then he has been their chief<br>scientific officer on something like an<br>80 position but throughout that time he<br>maintained his links with biochemistry<br>and this was formally recognized in 2006<br>when he took up a a 20 position as<br>research associate professor and that<br>became a full-time position by about<br>march 2010<br>and at that point he also became the<br>director of the center for translational<br>from that 2001 period onwards parry has<br>researched and published in a wide range<br>of cancers<br>can gastric cancers colorectal cancer<br>testicular cancer breast cancer<br>endometrial cancer melanomas<br>and<br>last but not least<br>multi-gene<br>urine tests as markers for bladder<br>cancer of which there's quite a lot of<br>publicity at the moment<br>some of those he will be talking about<br>in his presentation to you tonight<br>specifically gastric cancers and<br>melanoma<br>and the<br>urine test for bladder cancer<br>the productivity from all this is<br>something like three book chapters and<br>58 peer-reviewed articles<br>12 patents<br>and a multitude of invitations to be a<br>speaker at international and national<br>conferences<br>and of course serving on a number of<br>professional bodies<br>in a capacity to help organize<br>conferences and the like<br>obviously all this research requires<br>funding<br>and<br>parry has been really successful at<br>gaining funding<br>initially with tony reeve<br>and then on his own bat as pi<br>and<br>over the period of um 2003 and 2006<br>he and tony reeve got hrc programme<br>grants to look at the<br>topic of genetics and epigenetics of<br>cancer they also got an hrc project<br>grant to look at the stomach cancer in<br>maori and develop that further<br>since then perry has been a pi on all<br>his grants<br>a 1998 marsden grant to look at<br>bacterial immunity and cancer<br>susceptibility links<br>and then<br>two hrc<br>project grants in 2002<br>and two hrc project grants in 2011<br>all to support the various cancer<br>studies that i've alluded to<br>and indeed since his promotion to<br>research professor<br>he has<br>gained<br>an mbi smart ideas grant<br>for sequence based diagnostics from<br>single cells<br>prior to this university recognizing his<br>research capability with promotion to<br>research professor<br>parry<br>parry's research abilities were<br>recognized by gaining a james cook<br>fellowship from 2010 to 2011.<br>so i have hope i've managed to<br>paint a reasonably accurate picture of<br>you perry<br>um probably not comprehensive i wasn't<br>given enough time and you don't really<br>want to listen to me anywhere you want<br>to listen to parry<br>and i've tended to concentrate a bit<br>more on the earlier years because parry<br>will be take we will be talking more<br>about the more recent years<br>and i hope i've given you a little bit<br>of a picture of his research journey<br>that has led him to this point in time<br>where he will be giving his ipl<br>lecture to you today<br>so i would like you all to welcome parry<br>and i'm sure you're going to really<br>right so i'm told these these talks um<br>usually have some degree of um story<br>about about your life and so i've got<br>just a couple of slides<br>about my very early years um growing up<br>in in umaru with my brother grant<br>sitting here<br>and just two children and our parents<br>bill<br>and patricia<br>we had a very<br>enjoyable<br>childhood<br>carefree childhood<br>and i'd like to dedicate this talk to<br>the memory of<br>things got a bit harder<br>in 65 and i had to go to school<br>i know that this shot was taken on the<br>left on the way to school i know that<br>but fortunately by the age of seven<br>the the further left shot um i<br>discovered the science library and uh<br>and things were starting to kind of<br>settle in a bit of a routine of a bit of<br>from there it was kind of fairly<br>uneventful in terms of of science until<br>when i was in in<br>my school cert here fifth form<br>i was still very unsure whether i wanted<br>to be a scientist or whether i wanted to<br>be you know anything else at all<br>and i saw this photograph in our<br>textbook for general science and i<br>thought this is so this is a photograph<br>of a<br>virus called a bacteriophage one which<br>infects bacteria and i was incredibly<br>struck by the<br>the elegance the beauty and the power<br>and the and the pure design<br>of this virus i thought well you know<br>this could perhaps be where i might go<br>so that was the first inkling that i had<br>an interest in science rather than any<br>and there we'll jump again a few more<br>years and this this is now through to<br>um<br>when i was doing my masters with mer<br>smith i was very lucky to get into merv<br>smith's lab i didn't give merv very much<br>in return but he gave me a lot he he<br>kind of<br>he really reinforced that interest i had<br>in science and it was a very exciting<br>time for me to actually be in a lab when<br>you're working with professional<br>scientists so i'm very grateful to move<br>from there it was as you heard from pat<br>um up to dslr so i got my first job so<br>age 22 i shipped off up to auckland<br>and i was um and i was shown into my<br>office<br>at dsir in mount albert and i was i was<br>struck by this first thing i had this<br>huge office to myself age 22 years of<br>age with the masters under my belt<br>but on the desk<br>on my big desk was a letter<br>and i opened up the letter and said dear<br>mr gilford<br>your retirement date is september 10<br>2025.<br>and uh so i just come immediately i'm<br>going to gasp and and and feel of kind<br>of claustrophobia and fear and so<br>yeah i understand now i feel very very<br>happy i have my salaries but over five<br>short-term grants i feel much more<br>relaxed<br>so the work though as pat was said was<br>uh was on<br>on plant viruses and also um for a while<br>i was what was called new zealand's<br>ornamental plant virologist and so i had<br>to do things like understand or figure<br>out why the camellia leaf had such a<br>severe model<br>and it was a quite a pressure job the<br>camellia society in auckland's actually<br>quite an intense group and they did<br>put me through the ringer from time to<br>time so uh<br>and i had to kind of let them down i<br>failed to find the the virus which was<br>causing um camellia mottle so it's one<br>of my regrets<br>so keep on bouncing along then i went to<br>cambridge so i was i got this remarkable<br>phd scholarship to get to go to<br>cambridge it was one where i had my full<br>salary paid plus extra money so my<br>standard of living would not be any less<br>than it was at home in auckland<br>and so that you know gave me a check<br>each week of<br>250 pounds a week in the hand apparently<br>that was 1986 and i had no idea whether<br>that was a lot of money or not sounded<br>like a quite a small amount because i<br>was getting dollars at home and it's now<br>260 pounds<br>you know<br>a week so i asked went to my um<br>supervisor<br>now sir david balcom winner of the<br>alaska prize a couple of years ago for<br>his work on small<br>interfering rnas i said<br>dave i'm getting 250 pounds a week in<br>the hand won't be enough he said well<br>so<br>our relationship really struggled for<br>many many years and uh<br>only in the<br>only in the last you know year or so did<br>we start to kind of see eye to eye as he<br>got his promotions and started to win<br>these awards and prizes<br>uh so from there a quick trip back to<br>home to new zealand but i i had started<br>to kind of um<br>um have an interest in in human research<br>by this point i i just simply wasn't<br>being particularly satisfied by my work<br>and plants i mean there are exciting<br>things to work on but my general my kind<br>of<br>my personal desire was was in other<br>areas and<br>so i i was lucky enough to get a<br>position in<br>the past institute with uh christine<br>batty who is an incredibly bright woman<br>um very very driven and her interest was<br>in the area of of the very genetics of<br>um of deafness of uh of uh<br>speech impediments any any kind of you<br>know um<br>you know language difficulties she was<br>an area she would um research within<br>great depth<br>and she asked me to do a project which<br>was pat mentioned which was to try and<br>find these genes for human deafness and<br>at the time of what it hadn't been done<br>and it was pat said it and people said<br>it couldn't be done because there are so<br>many different families around and<br>there's so much<br>inter marriage between families the<br>chances of trying to find a deafness a<br>deafness gene<br>in a western society is actually very<br>very low<br>so she had the smart idea of sending me<br>so i went to tunisia one of the old<br>former french colonies<br>and we traveled around these villages<br>um where we were knew whether many um<br>deaf families and these families were<br>deaf because they um<br>it's recessive deafness and so they'll<br>often marry first cousins there<br>and so you see you know whole families<br>or not your mum and dad would be okay<br>but all his children um who are deaf and<br>you know we went to one village lunch<br>with this one here we went to local<br>school and there was 200 deaf kitties in<br>that school so pretty remarkable<br>so we took blood samples from<br>the the families um in these in these<br>villages around tunisia and um and took<br>them back to the labor in paris and and<br>were able to map these deafness genes<br>so we use these things called<br>microsatellites which now are you know<br>you know almost and or certainly unused<br>in human um genetics by the time they<br>were quite exciting<br>um and again as pap mentioned uh one of<br>the genes we found was turns out to<br>account for all about 30 percent of all<br>uh human deafness and 1 in 30 of us are<br>carriers of mutations in that gene so an<br>when i was there most of the work on<br>these micro satellites with actual gene<br>mapping was carried out of the lab<br>called genoton which is on the outskirts<br>of paris and a pretty rough neighborhood<br>and it was a building which was<br>kitted out by the french muscular<br>dystrophy dystrophy foundation<br>and<br>they did something which i thought was<br>quite clever they had a lot of money<br>there and so they built all these new<br>um all this new infrastructure to kind<br>of help people map genes for various<br>diseases not only dystrophy so that's<br>how i got to to use their facility<br>but what i<br>found inspiring was that on the ground<br>floor of this building here they would<br>have the daycare for all the kids with<br>dystrophy and then the labs were on the<br>the upper floors<br>but we all shared the same cafeteria<br>and so one day i was trying to get my<br>croissants out of the little cabinet<br>with the tongs and struggling away<br>trying to you know getting you know get<br>out without losing the avocado on the<br>floor<br>and the guy beside me was sitting in a<br>wheelchair with a device strapped to his<br>head trying to do the same thing<br>and i thought well how can i possibly<br>go back<br>to my lab upstairs and work on something<br>which is just of interest to me and of<br>no relevance to people<br>so that was a turning point for me<br>realizing that we i really have to focus<br>so<br>um i had to come back to dsr again<br>partly because i still had a bond for my<br>my very wealthy phd to pay off so i had<br>to come back for another year to pay off<br>that bond<br>um and i worked on amongst other things<br>trying to we developed a test pcr test<br>for fire blight which<br>has now really been one of the features<br>which has helped new zealand apples<br>almost get into the australian market<br>but but not quite<br>but most importantly when i was there i<br>was back in my office in my same office<br>sitting there stole my letter on my desk<br>to remind me i hadn't saw another<br>30 ideas to go<br>when when the phone rang and on the end<br>of the phone was this character here<br>some of you might know him um this is uh<br>tony reeve um you see him gazing dreamly<br>in the distance there never very good<br>with a pipette was tony but<br>he had other strengths he brought to the<br>table<br>so tony called and he asked me to join<br>him<br>um at a and a little porter cabin out<br>the back of this mirai here so the<br>little port cabin was out here somewhere<br>he said look i've had a phone call from<br>his family and i've got this really<br>unusual cancer or inherited cancer<br>and i hear you know how to find jeans<br>come and join me um and we'll we'll see<br>if we can do this project<br>so we met um in that porter cabin out<br>the back<br>so this family we're at um<br>on there on the mri they had a shocking<br>history of stomach cancer i'll show you<br>the pedigree in a minute<br>um and<br>they had had probably roughly a death<br>every one or two years for as long as<br>they could remember from stomach cancer<br>the people who were meeting with<br>said that the general belief was that<br>they had been cursed<br>and they've been cursed because they had<br>sold land to city council and that land<br>had been quarried and um and bones had<br>been turned up the land had been tapu<br>some of that was true the um<br>this land up here this is the quarry you<br>can see the remains of the quarry up<br>here so the land was indeed quarried by<br>the city council to get the rock to to<br>help build the new port in mount<br>monganoui<br>so that was true and certainly bones<br>were turned up these people had lived<br>there for 800 years so of course there<br>were bones all over that hillside<br>so they believed that they had been<br>cursed because they had sold land for<br>profit<br>the the truth is that the land was taken<br>from them under the public works act so<br>they never deserved to be cursed in the<br>first place<br>so<br>tony and i<br>decided to start on this project this<br>this is the the family so<br>um squares are<br>um males circles are females if it's<br>filled in black the people have<br>developed in this case they've all died<br>of stomach cancer<br>and a few other cancers there as well<br>let's just focus on the on the the black<br>symbol so down the bottom there you can<br>see<br>particularly this family here there are<br>12 children of whom eight um developed<br>and died of stomach cancer and the<br>youngest<br>was a 14 year old boy so the average age<br>in this family of of dying of stomach<br>cancer was around about 32 so a terrible<br>terrible situation so everybody had<br>siblings who had died everybody had a<br>parent or an uncle or not who had died<br>and they all had dozens of cousins who<br>have died of this so it was not only the<br>cancer which was killing the family but<br>they were being destroyed by the social<br>impact as well this was not a trivial<br>thing everyone fed<br>uh that any pain they might have felt in<br>the stomach was the cancer developing so<br>it was led to as well as a medical<br>problem it led to a huge social cost as<br>well there was no great intent on<br>getting a mortgage or a stable marriage<br>or a nice stable life because i have got<br>a pain in my stomach i felt it last<br>night that is my cancer grain and i will<br>be dead before christmas so very little<br>intent on stability so this is a<br>really quite a wild whanau they were<br>living it um pretty fast and furious and<br>souped up holdens and and falcons which<br>so the family had been described before<br>and it was described in 1964 by a guy<br>called ted jones who's a graduate of<br>otago university did his medical degree<br>down here<br>so ted<br>wrote this paper and he said an optical<br>cast name in the stomach and a 21 year<br>old is a tragic discovery this paper<br>reports a maori family in which gastric<br>cancer is too common to be coincidental<br>and he also<br>had a few other quotes as well the<br>president's surveys of his paper on<br>stomach cancer<br>seems to have done a little more than<br>imbue the family with a deep sense of<br>makutu or curse<br>in the event of the other members of the<br>family become affected they may be more<br>inclined towards their gods than their<br>doctors so this is 1964. not the<br>language we use now but certainly that<br>portrays the situation that ted found<br>himself in so there was not much more he<br>could do<br>partly because the family was closing in<br>and we're not<br>you know working with them on this but<br>also there was no genetic maps really<br>they could not find the gene anyway in<br>those days so<br>nothing happened for a long time apart<br>from muldoon came into power<br>lakes went up boats went down all<br>through the 60s and 70s and 80s it all<br>throughout time they were getting<br>a death or two every um every couple of<br>years<br>and you know the social impact was<br>terrible as i mentioned before<br>you know why bother doing anything i'm<br>going to die anyway um you know don't<br>marry macleod let's name the family in<br>the clouds<br>i had a received a letter from a um a<br>house surgeon who moved to<br>to um canada he actually read our paper<br>on this and he said um when i was uh<br>just just graduated and i was working in<br>wanganui<br>and um i was asked to take a look at a<br>young woman who had what was called then<br>the then<br>nearly fashionable disease anorexia<br>nervosa and because she was vomiting a<br>lot and could i give her something and<br>get it down to psych uh psychiatry award<br>he said um i went and saw her and i was<br>i i knew very little about anorexia but<br>i knew a little bit about stomach cancer<br>and i could see that she was very unwell<br>and so i had her scoped and we were able<br>to show that she had advanced cancer and<br>he said this woman was in her early 20s<br>so he said with a great trepidation i<br>went and saw this woman's mother who was<br>waiting in the waiting room and told her<br>the news and she just shrugged her<br>shoulders and said<br>well of course because she's already<br>lost her her father and two sisters and<br>her brother to the same disease<br>and his line was i've never again<br>forgotten to ask for a family history<br>so we were able to show using those<br>various techniques that would uh work on<br>in<br>paris and other schools that um that<br>tony's lab<br>had in place were able to kind of show<br>that the disease in the family was<br>caused by mutation<br>in one gene and it's caused by a g to t<br>change<br>and one single base in a gene called<br>cdh-1 or e-cadherin so this is the<br>catherine gene here so it's a great it's<br>a great it's a great read but one<br>one single base there was change from a<br>g to a t and that was responsible for<br>all the deaths it was responsible for<br>all the other social effects which have<br>occurred in that family so a great<br>example of reductionism surely<br>so<br>since then have we made any progress<br>well yes we have this is just family<br>family a alone so showing the kind of<br>the deaths in that family um<br>prior to finding the gene and since<br>finding the genes so what we've been<br>able to do<br>is by using surveillance and wherever<br>possible prophylactic surgery<br>get the death rate right down to you<br>know getting close to baseline it's<br>still not perfect we still see the odd<br>person<br>is dying from the cancer partly because<br>not everyone is engaged in the screening<br>program and partly because quite a few<br>people really don't want to have a<br>constrictor me they want to have<br>surveillance alone which is a reasonable<br>choice for many people but it comes with<br>a risk you can't always find the cancer<br>by surveillance alone<br>and then outside that family<br>there are many families around the world<br>now so around about 350 families around<br>the world um whom 16 in new zealand and<br>including<br>one in dunedin as well<br>and<br>i'm just really quite disappointed that<br>we haven't had much<br>you know more success from our<br>colleagues in chad because my slide will<br>look much better if we had<br>a family and shared but that will come<br>in time so<br>there's several thousand people carrying<br>mutations in the ecaterian gene we don't<br>know the exact number because it's<br>getting so common now it's no longer<br>published um but we're aware of you know<br>every week or two there's a couple of<br>families being diagnosed with it<br>worldwide<br>so why did this project work i mean you<br>understand there was quite a bit of<br>distance culturally between a<br>whanau and uh in mount monganui and the<br>university of otago<br>and a lot has been made of various<br>protocols that we had to follow<br>and we also had a contract between the<br>two groups as well which you know they<br>were useful to kind of underline certain<br>principles but the main reason why the<br>study worked was because we genuinely<br>had shared goals and trust between the<br>parties that takes time to build up but<br>that was the principal reason why the<br>research was able to work because we<br>right so changing tech just briefly to<br>pacific edge because some of you have<br>probably been following the share market<br>and know that<br>um it's making a bit of an impact<br>recently so it's a company that we<br>formed in 2001 so tony ian and i and a<br>few others<br>formed in 2001 and our idea then was we<br>needed more money as always to fund the<br>research in the in our laboratory we<br>also wanted to find ways to get to get<br>money to commercialize our research and<br>finish our research off because you know<br>you know people often say that research<br>not publishes research not done we would<br>also say research which has not been<br>applied as research not done certainly<br>in the area of medical<br>research<br>so we wanted to get a company going to<br>help us to give us a a way to get our<br>research out and applied into<br>for actual clinical use<br>we also wanted to find a way to employ<br>our graduate concern that i had then i<br>still have now is that we have so many<br>graduates coming through and we don't<br>have jobs for them all<br>so we're able to get funding from a<br>group called the new zealand seed fund<br>chaired by rod dean the former telecom<br>ceo<br>and so 10 million dollars got the<br>company going and it had as of last<br>night a market 417 million dollars so a<br>remarkable increase<br>in value<br>and it was kind of really built on<br>technology that tony um brought to the<br>lab which was really we were just<br>adopted early adopters of um of<br>microarray gene expression profiling we<br>applied that to this particular problem<br>of uh cancer diagnostics<br>one we noted bottom there<br>and i've got a something about um you<br>know the role of serendipity<br>and research i know it's seen has been a<br>very important thing and certainly is a<br>very important thing for creating new<br>ideas and new and new thinking but to me<br>the most important thing is being in the<br>right place<br>to observe serendipity if it does occur<br>and knowing what it means when you see<br>it and be able to take make the most of<br>it all it's not simply about certainly<br>happens and then you carry on this was<br>an example of progress made simply<br>through risk taking so it wasn't a<br>serendipity it was a risk-taking<br>adventure<br>and we just had to follow our noses<br>so just one's quick slide on that so the<br>test that which is which has now been<br>marketed internationally is called cx<br>bladder<br>and the logic behind the test is that<br>cancer cells of course will have<br>different gene expression patterns to<br>normal cells<br>and those cells if tumor develops inside<br>the bladder though some of those cells<br>will fall off into the urine and then<br>you can take a urine sample you can<br>analyze the the expression markers or<br>the expression of rna markers in that<br>sample<br>and you can diagnose the disease so<br>quite a simple idea but where we were a<br>bit different in the head of other<br>groups was that one we're happy to look<br>for rna in urine most people said no way<br>it'll always degrade you'll never you'll<br>never see it in fact it doesn't degrade<br>it's quite stable another one was<br>because of this early adoption of<br>microarray technology we're able to<br>quickly find markers good markers<br>for the cancer<br>in these bladder tumors<br>so<br>one other thing<br>i this didn't happen<br>in isolation so throughout this period<br>of my life um annette and i had um four<br>children and you can see them over there<br>somewhere um so it's um i'm very proud<br>of my family so i'll leave it i'll leave<br>right now i need to kind of get a little<br>bit focused and tell you a little bit<br>about cancer i know that's what the um<br>why you're here is to look at the the<br>problem and the promise the disease i'll<br>try and explain<br>the key features of the disease and why<br>i think the future does look quite<br>bright<br>to me cancer is a very primitive and<br>fundamental disease i'll tell you why i<br>think that over the next few slides<br>it occurs and everything which has more<br>than a few cells will get cancer so<br>worms get cancer you can see up there<br>the little<br>worm on the right has a tumor on its<br>side<br>flies get cancer you can sell a<br>difference there can't you<br>fish get cancer this is a melanoma on a<br>zebrafish<br>tasmanian devils get cancer they get a<br>particularly difficult i might explain<br>this but later on if i have time they<br>get cancer as well<br>it's also a very old disease so the<br>dinosaurs used to get cancer so this is<br>brontosaurus 150 million years ago<br>developed uh we don't know if there's a<br>primary tumor or a metastasis to the<br>bone but certainly<br>the dinosaurs did get cancer<br>the pharaohs got cancer so prostate<br>cancer has been shown in a<br>pharaoh from 250 bc<br>the<br>original peruvian population also you<br>can see<br>evidence<br>of bone cancer in<br>the remains of people from those<br>villages up in the high arid zones of<br>the of the country<br>and more recently this is michelangelo's<br>sculpture tonight this woman has<br>breast cancer in her left breast and<br>it's believed that the reason that<br>michaelangelo did this sculpture was to<br>exemplify the pain that this woman was<br>going through<br>so it is caused by genetic damage in<br>genes that regulate cell growth<br>survival and migration<br>that damage leads to<br>provides raw material for selection<br>of cells that have some kind of acquired<br>growth advantage so it's really it's<br>really just the same as evolution but<br>sped up<br>you can get this genetic damage by<br>five<br>different ways<br>roughly<br>one is lifestyle<br>so these<br>bad nuns were probably smoking 40 a day<br>and so<br>bad nuns who smoke for your day get lung<br>cancer<br>i don't know what happens to good nuns<br>you smoke for your day but i guess they<br>don't but there's no data on that yet<br>you<br>can have a high risk occupation so for<br>example<br>chimney sweeps develop a<br>very high rate of cancer of the scrotum<br>of all places another indignity for the<br>scrotum<br>and in fact this was the first time<br>anyone has shown that environmental<br>factors could actually cause cancer<br>was this example<br>the environment so on the um on your uh<br>left there is the virus hpv which causes<br>cervical cancer we know that radiation<br>causes it causes cancer um and then back<br>to those tasmanian devils again so um<br>they're very unusual they when they if a<br>tasmanian devil has a cancer in its<br>mouth and it bites another tasmanian<br>devil its transfer of cells will occur<br>and those cells will actually survive in<br>the other tasmanian endeavors so the<br>disease is spread simply by a form of<br>kind of you know very close xenograft<br>you know transplants<br>so many many ways to get cancer from the<br>environment<br>you can hear it faulty genes we've<br>discussed that before um<br>on the right there is uh pauline haruera<br>from from our<br>family a um we've got<br>uh pope john the 23rd napoleon all these<br>people from families with inherited<br>stomach cancer but of course many many<br>other families have other forms of<br>inherited disease<br>but probably the most important and one<br>which is probably least focused on<br>is bad luck<br>there are 3.3 billion letters in the<br>genetic code and every few days that<br>code must be copied and mistakes really<br>shouldn't happen but they do<br>there's a lot of effort made by the cell<br>to<br>fix mistakes but they still occur they<br>can accumulate and when you get enough<br>mutations in a particular cell cancer<br>can develop<br>so we don't really live in the garden of<br>eden at all it's it is a high risk<br>situation there is a very high<br>background rate of mutation which can<br>lead to cancer which of course explains<br>why cancer is more common disease in<br>right so<br>the effect of this genetic damage um<br>is is incredibly profound in normal<br>cells<br>gene expression that is the activity of<br>genes is very tightly controlled<br>that is in terms of its timing<br>its location so mito genes might be<br>turned on a particular cell type and<br>never in other cell types and also scale<br>or its magnitude<br>very very tight control and and cells<br>are programmed for very specialist<br>functions so you know the general idea<br>is a cell will live for a few days or<br>perform its function and then it will<br>die on cue and be no more trouble to the<br>to the organism<br>and cancer is a little bit different<br>that regulation is gone<br>there's no more contribution to the<br>greater good<br>and<br>um cells can acquire functions which are<br>normally used only in certain specialist<br>situations<br>so<br>i think i explain that a little bit on<br>this next slide so the acquire what we<br>call the quiet capabilities of cancer<br>are these or here are examples of them<br>they can migrate like cells and develop<br>develop an embryo or in a healing wound<br>they can move in and out of blood<br>vessels like an immune cell can<br>they can coax blood vessels to grow<br>towards them like new tissues do<br>they can decrease their reliance on<br>oxygen like hypoxic tissues do they can<br>hive an immune system like cells in the<br>colon do<br>they can make growth factors which are<br>normally only made for them by other<br>cells they can lengthen their telomeres<br>structures on the end of chromosomes to<br>make them more like stem cells and more<br>robust and live longer<br>they can ignore signals to calm down<br>their cell division which are normally<br>made by neighboring cells they can<br>recruit inflammatory cells to provide<br>growth factors<br>they can ignore with great apply death<br>signals and limit the lifespan of normal<br>cells<br>they amplify progress growth signals<br>coming from neighboring cells they pump<br>out drugs like kidney cells and they can<br>resist radiation again like stem cells<br>so it's really like a cancer cell<br>it's like playing cards<br>with someone who has every card in the<br>deck<br>so we will we'll have a hand of five<br>cards and we're gonna play this one<br>because we're limited by you know<br>anatomical location localization we're<br>limited by time and space but the cancer<br>has the entire pack in its hand and i'll<br>play whatever card it needs if it wants<br>to move and migrate it will play that<br>card and move and migrate if it wants to<br>kind of invade a certain area<br>divide rapidly it'll play another card<br>and it has that whole deck to play with<br>so it's capabilities that it has are not<br>unique it's not like a virus or<br>a<br>bacteria or a fungus<br>infection this is the same tricks that<br>we have in a normal normal<br>a normal body but been applied when and<br>where it needs it<br>so it's really these are quite<br>capabilities which give it the power not<br>they're not unique to a cancer but<br>they've they've been grabbed from<br>the various skills that a body has and<br>used<br>so for these kind of reasons<br>drugs that kill cancer<br>also damage normal cells because the<br>we're not dealing with something which<br>is foreign it's not a foreign invader it<br>is us<br>just which has gone awry which is<br>disregulated so<br>almost all drugs that all drugs which<br>will target the cancer will also impact<br>on normal cells as well and hence the<br>problem that we have with side effects<br>so what progress<br>has been made and what is the promise of<br>the future<br>there has been no progress i'm sorry to<br>there has been progress in measuring how<br>far away you should be from one of those<br>big radiation machines<br>so that's that's promising<br>this is the the five year survival rates<br>of children so zero to 14 years of age<br>for all the<br>the main cancers that children get so<br>you can see<br>in the 1960s uh you know really poor<br>survival rates everyone under 50<br>and then now survival rates are you know<br>60 70 80 percent and even with leukemia<br>which in the 1950s killed every single<br>child who got it<br>now the survival rate is over 90 so<br>remarkable success in childhood cancers<br>in breast cancer and adults also great<br>improvements as well and this is for<br>three reasons one that decline there<br>one is through screening two is better<br>self-awareness by woman and three is<br>better management<br>of patients so all those three reasons<br>coming together to cause that decrease<br>in rate<br>in colon cancer this graph shows that in<br>blue<br>all individuals and males and females<br>separately below you can see the same<br>trend it is getting better the mortality<br>is starting to fall away really driven<br>mainly by the development of new drugs<br>and also<br>in part by better surgical technique but<br>we are seeing a distinct improvement in<br>the survival of patients<br>with these cancers so things are<br>and the real promise i think comes from<br>the fact that cancer is no longer a<br>black box we've been open up we've been<br>able to open up the lid on cancer and we<br>look in and we see a very very complex<br>wiring pattern and it's very complex<br>but<br>we can understand it we don't understand<br>it yet but we can understand that we<br>have the backbone of it all that we can<br>understand and we will understand it in<br>its entirety<br>this is the<br>the wiring diagram of cancer as we know<br>it at the moment so you see it's really<br>quite complex and this is probably only<br>about a tenth of its true complexity<br>imagine everything having another 10<br>more connections out in different<br>directions but we are starting to get a<br>very clear framework of its wiring<br>diagram how different parts of the cell<br>work together how they control cell<br>division how they control migration all<br>working together very carefully through<br>so we're moving into the era an era of<br>personalised medicine where<br>individual tumors will be analyzed and<br>mutations will be identified<br>and<br>those mutations will be ones which we<br>know cause abnormal growth or<br>proliferation or migration<br>and then we'll be able to select drugs<br>which block that the growth of that<br>particular tumor based on that<br>particular mutation profile<br>i'll give you an example of uh of uh you<br>know progressive area this is you know<br>not how i work this is um<br>stories about melanoma um melanoma has<br>gone from being really the problem child<br>to the poster child of um of targeted<br>cancer treatment<br>so this is one of those pathways you see<br>there where on the outside of the cell<br>that little blue mushroom up there for<br>example<br>it's a growth factor as it's a growth<br>receptor it receives signals from<br>outside the cell and gets passed down<br>through this little circuit into the<br>cell cells nucleus where genes are<br>turned on and those genes control cell<br>migration or survival or proliferation<br>what you see in in cancer is often<br>mutation of that particular protein<br>there so it's called b ref it undergoes<br>mutations which mean means that pathway<br>is just turned on all the time it<br>doesn't no longer needs to have a<br>message from outside the cell to say<br>divide it just is turned on and goes and<br>goes and goes and goes and goes so so<br>the cells now become<br>independent of<br>messages from the outside it just says i<br>will do what i want to do i've now got<br>my way to cause cell division at all<br>whenever i want to<br>so the problem is of course that leads<br>to melanoma and this is a patient with<br>very obviously very very advanced<br>melanoma<br>the exciting thing has been that drugs<br>have now been developed which target<br>these mutant proteins uh very very very<br>tightly<br>so here's a drug called<br>varuma thinnip which<br>blocks that braf protein really really<br>very tightly and when you give that to<br>patients such as this one here you see a<br>remarkable improvement<br>in<br>in the disease so this is only 15 weeks<br>from treatment and you see a<br>remarkable regression in the size of the<br>cancer in this patient so this is<br>extremely unusual to see this i mean no<br>other drugs would ever give an effect<br>the strong in melanoma so clearly we're<br>doing something right i know you can<br>guess i'm working up with some bad news<br>shortly but for now<br>and enjoy the good moment because this<br>is remarkable and it shows we can<br>understand rationally some of these<br>pathways and do the right thing if we<br>understand the pathway well enough<br>so the the<br>now we've<br>we've hit the tennis ball and now the<br>cancer is going to is going to reply it<br>says well that's fine you've blocked my<br>pathway here so i don't care i'll find a<br>way around that so again through a<br>process of very rapid evolution it will<br>bypass that mutation it will do things<br>like turn on these proteins down here<br>and get them to signal through to the<br>nucleus to cause cell division and cell<br>migration and cell proliferation<br>it will bypass the whole blockade as<br>well and so<br>that means<br>quite rapidly the tumor will overcome<br>the blockade and the disease will return<br>again so there's only another three<br>months or so later and the disease is<br>so<br>back to us what do we do<br>our turn to hit the ball back and indeed<br>we i can't show you a pitch of course<br>that patient but indeed we've already<br>made that next step forward as well by<br>developing drugs against the next<br>protein down and given those two drugs<br>at the same time rather than just one<br>drug<br>you get an incredibly good improvement<br>again so you can double the median<br>survival of patients with advanced<br>melanoma if you give those two drugs at<br>one time<br>so as we start to unravel<br>where the mutations occur unravel these<br>various pathways we can select drugs<br>which can put blockades on effective<br>blockades which can prevent the<br>development of the tumor and indeed<br>eradicate it<br>so to me it's very exciting and it's<br>very rational and just requires a great<br>knowledge of the details of the pathways<br>and the drugs to treat them<br>here's another brief example this is a<br>case of colon cancer um or the disease<br>colon cancer<br>where the tumors do not have any<br>mutations<br>of any particular gene so they have<br>actually no mutation in a gene called<br>pic3ca so you hear you see here that<br>this the long-term survival is not so<br>great only about 20 of people um<br>or 20 people will die um over a 10-year<br>period um for this this class of tumor<br>and and aspirin this will make more<br>sense in a minute aspirin does nothing<br>of course to stopping the development of<br>these cancers<br>but there is a subgroup of patients who<br>have a mutation in the in the pic3ca<br>genes so about about a 50 patients have<br>a mutation and pick 3ca gene<br>and look at their survival so here's<br>patients who have no aspirin use and<br>they actually have a slightly worse<br>survival than those who have your normal<br>pic3ca<br>but if they take aspirin routinely<br>then they get a remarkable increase in<br>survival and that is because aspirin<br>impacts on this pic3ca pathway which has<br>gone which has gone wrong in these<br>individuals so again it makes a point if<br>you understand the molecular the defect<br>inside of cancer you can choose drugs<br>often as simple as aspirin which can<br>make quite an important impact on the<br>so the future i think will involve<br>three things firstly a better<br>understanding of the complexities of<br>those of our signaling pathways of our<br>of our wiring diagram for the cancer<br>secondly we're going to need to do a bit<br>more work on on our techniques to<br>to unravel these mutations and work out<br>the ones which are most important for<br>the particular tumors and i think the<br>the biggest issue will be the and the<br>rate limiting step is going to be 0.3<br>there which is getting the drugs we<br>still don't have enough drugs to combat<br>all these various pathways and<br>permutations which are occurring<br>in various cancers<br>so just very briefly<br>um a word or two on what we're doing in<br>the lab to try and help with this kind<br>of area of drug development um in cancer<br>the process we're taking is one called<br>synthetic lethality where the idea is to<br>develop drugs which target cells with um<br>with particular mutations<br>and so yeah again the idea is it's one<br>where we're trying to target a cell's<br>acquired vulnerabilities rather than<br>this acquired strength so this guy here<br>he's a a brave russian soldier<br>you can see by the his cap he's carrying<br>two hand grenades but if you rip off his<br>uniform he's actually not so tough at<br>all so<br>we always think of cancers as being<br>all-powerful all dangerous or<br>threatening but in fact the mutations<br>that they<br>gather and and select for<br>throughout the development also create<br>vulnerabilities and if you can target<br>these vulnerabilities then you have a<br>way to beat the cancer<br>so our particular example has been<br>working on again this this gene cdh1 or<br>ekat here and one which is mutated in<br>the mario families i showed you at the<br>start<br>with um<br>this this slide here on the left-hand<br>side is normal cells the right-hand side<br>of cells which have mutations in this<br>gene cdh-1 or e-cadherin<br>and the the green lines um if you were<br>it's called the microtubule network so<br>it's really like the the street map of a<br>cell it's how cells will move organelles<br>around how they move proteins around the<br>cell and this is the what the way of<br>transporting um information and material<br>around the cell so you see on the left<br>hand side it's kind of organized and an<br>affiliate radial pattern coming out of<br>the octagon and across across the city<br>but in cells which have mutations in the<br>cdh1 gene<br>it's lost that radial pattern it's got<br>unusual the fibers have kind of aligned<br>more with the<br>size of the cell with the cortex of the<br>cell so clearly it's very very unusual<br>and we've been able to do a drug screen<br>on on these cells and find an example<br>here of one drug called ms275 is an hdac<br>inhibitor which causes really no death<br>at all in the normal cells that which<br>especially catherine or cdh1 that causes<br>a dose to be an increase in cell death<br>um for the cells which have mutations in<br>the cdh1 so clearly we've<br>we've been able to find here a weakness<br>in those eched here hero negative cells<br>so you get hearing loss makes a cell<br>more aggressive more invasive more<br>likely to migrate and spread around the<br>body<br>but it comes at a price and if we can<br>target those<br>those weaknesses as we are here we can<br>so<br>finally<br>a point that we work very very hard at<br>trying to get drugs which have good<br>response rates extremely good response<br>rates in patients we work very very hard<br>at trying to get tests in diagnostic<br>tests which have extremely good<br>sensitivity so for example 80 percent is<br>not good enough let's get 85 let's get<br>90<br>very important gains<br>but what we often don't think about is<br>the continuum of cancer care<br>so if we have a very very good test for<br>cancer or very very good drug for cancer<br>but we do not get that test or drug out<br>to all the people who need it then our<br>true<br>sensitivity our true response rate is<br>really quite poor so it's terribly<br>important that we must address the<br>continuum of cancer care we can't just<br>focus on in our lab on our pathways on<br>our drug development we have to look at<br>the continuum right through to the<br>patient so in particular we need to kind<br>of think about maori we've got to think<br>about rural populations because i think<br>about the poor people as well who cannot<br>afford um to access these drugs or for<br>some reason are unable to access the<br>medical care they need so terribly<br>important we don't lose track of that<br>there's no good developing fancy drugs<br>in isolation it has to be<br>done in the context of the continuum of<br>cancer care<br>and i'll leave it there so thank you<br>or perry that was amazing i mean that<br>was just truly truly inspiring thank you<br>very much for that lecture<br>um i find myself sort of secretly<br>wishing that i could come be a postdoc<br>in your laboratory because it's so<br>inspirational and if i get relieved of<br>duty tonight i'll be there tomorrow i<br>don't know<br>i'm willing to do like you know work<br>without paying your job actually because<br>i have i have these three boxes of<br>grading to do in the office<br>and i think i'd much rather come and<br>work but it's truly truly inspiring<br>because i feel like i've seen the future<br>um<br>and it's an amazing future because i can<br>see that that in this future<br>that people with different tumors are no<br>longer going to be lumped together like<br>okay you've got stomach cancer you've<br>got colon cancer we're all going to know<br>the genetic basis of whatever it is<br>that's causing our cancer or our disease<br>and we'll be able to talk about that<br>genetic basis with our physician<br>and having this genetic basis of cancer<br>will allow physicians to pick the best<br>chemotherapy<br>it will also allow physicians to pick<br>what's probably going to be the cause of<br>the relapse right<br>and it sort of heralds this<br>designer therapy that we've all been<br>talking about in terms of molecular<br>medicine<br>and in another life ago i used to<br>practice medicine in the states and i<br>used to treat people with cancer and i<br>can remember really thinking as as a<br>young physician all i'm basically<br>poisoning people and i'm poisoning the<br>tumor and it's a bit of a race right and<br>you just get a sense of how incredibly<br>primitive it is as people's hair falls<br>out and their platelets drop and their<br>gi system suffers and you think there's<br>got to be a better way there's got to be<br>a molecular way and that's really one of<br>the reasons that i ended up going back<br>into research is to try to to to be a<br>part of the kind of program that you<br>sketched out for us<br>so i think it's just such an incredibly<br>exciting time<br>and it's so important to get it right<br>and you've convinced me perry that you<br>are going to get it right and that your<br>your crew is going to get it right<br>um so i i feel like i've seen the future<br>in the future as now<br>it's good and i'm incredibly glad that<br>you're on our team and that you're in<br>the department of biochemistry<br>and it's a very we have a a very small<br>token to thank you for all the good<br>things that you do and to thank you for<br>this wonderful lecture and for letting<br>us in on on your world and we'd just<br>suitable for framing the image of perry<br>guilford giving the uh his ipl lecture<br>thank you there's a little bit of a<br>i think this is this month's pay<br>i'll hold on to this<br>you</p></main><footer
