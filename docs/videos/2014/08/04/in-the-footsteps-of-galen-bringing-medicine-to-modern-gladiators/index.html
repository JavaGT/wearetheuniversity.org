generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>atago good evening um my name is harleen<br>Hayne and I'm the vice Chancellor here<br>at the University of aago and it is my<br>great privilege to have the opportunity<br>to warmly welcome you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture as usual um I'm<br>happy to see that there are academic and<br>general staff there are students here<br>there are members of of the general<br>Community but I would also like to<br>extend this evening an especially warm<br>welcome to the large number of the<br>Gerard Clan who have also come uh to<br>support David at this very important<br>occasion his wife Barbara is here um<br>their sons Brett and Daniel are here<br>their daughters-in-law Bridget and<br>Carrie are here and David very proudly<br>told me that all of them are graduates<br>of the University of atago<br>now in addition to these uh alumni we<br>also have some future we scarfies in the<br>audience um and I'm not sure how many of<br>them actually made the final cut because<br>I know there was some discussion about<br>this but I would like to mention David's<br>four grandsons Harry Jimmy Oscar and<br>Patrick um who will be here with us as<br>long as they can manage um so we're very<br>happy to have you all<br>here now in order to become a professor<br>at the University of itago um academics<br>much must demonstrate excellence in<br>teaching in research and in service and<br>our speaker this evening has clearly<br>excelled in all three of these areas now<br>although I have never actually had the<br>pleasure of attending one of Dave's<br>lectures um he was one of the first<br>people who kindly responded to my call<br>for graduation speakers when I became<br>the vice Chancellor and so during his<br>graduation address uh in 2011 I did have<br>the opportunity to sample his teaching<br>style and his address was enthusiastic<br>it was entertaining authorative and<br>consistent with absolutely everything<br>David does it was also extraordinarily<br>warm and engaging he literally held uh<br>the graduates in the palm of his<br>hand now in terms of research um<br>Professor Gerard has played a leading<br>role in the development of sports<br>medicine as a research discipline in New<br>Zealand<br>in particular his research has made<br>important contributions to our<br>understanding of sports injury and<br>illness prevention to physical activity<br>and lifestyle and to muscle<br>physiology but it's in the area of<br>service that I think that Dave Gerard<br>really stands Head and Shoulders amongst<br>the rest of us um he has had sustained<br>service to the Olympic movement as an<br>athlete as an administrator and as a<br>medical doctor few other academics in<br>the the world can match his contribution<br>in this particular area he has also been<br>appointed to absolutely every<br>significant National and International<br>Community in the area of anti-doping in<br>sport and as one of the referees in<br>support of his promotion um highlighted<br>his standing in this area is<br>peerless so I would Now call on<br>Professor Barry Taylor to tell us a<br>little bit more um about David's journey<br>to professorship but before he does that<br>I would like to congratulate you myself<br>um thank you harleen my name is Barry<br>Taylor I'm the dean of the denan school<br>of medicine and this is the first uh<br>lecture IPL that I've had to<br>introduce um it's a great pleasure to do<br>that because I have collaborated with<br>Dave in some research over the years and<br>uh so it is actually nice to to do this<br>if you go to the end of a CV and instead<br>of looking at the first two pages and<br>you look at the last two pages you find<br>some interesting<br>things um he is currently either an<br>advisor or a recent past advisor to the<br>New Zealand Rugby Football Union netball<br>New Zealand New Zealand national Olympic<br>Committee New Zealand Judo Federation<br>ataro Rugby Football Union Athletics New<br>Zealand swimming New Zealand Serv life<br>saving New Zealand New Zealand gymnast<br>Association and if you go to the second<br>to last page you see a list of where<br>he's been asked to talk and I going to<br>outline the first one he's a a speaker<br>at the recent dened and armed fenders<br>dinner so you get an immediate flavor<br>that he is a person who is going to take<br>us uh in his hand over the next hour uh<br>and actually um uh give us really what<br>many others have already appreciated um<br>how did he get here um he is officially<br>n David Francis Gerard OB cnzm mbcb<br>atago FP and ifs M NZ I've had to<br>decipher some of these um fellow of the<br>australasian College of sports medicine<br>and so on so he's got a lot of things<br>after his name uh professor before his<br>name now how did he get here he was born<br>in Oakland educated at Oakland grammar<br>uh first came to aago in 1963 where he<br>studied physiotherapy graduating in<br>1967 uh followed by Hospital employment<br>in Ash bton and Oakland and then<br>shifting on um to uh to in fact Tasmania<br>and working in L War seston General<br>Hospital from 1977 to 1980 much of that<br>early time um actually involved in<br>Active Sports and actually taking time<br>out to to participate in a lot of<br>sport um after working in Tasmania he<br>came back to denen and was the position<br>in charge of our Student Health Service<br>um a position that he held for 12<br>years uh in 1995 he completed specialist<br>training was and was admitted as a<br>fellow to the austral Asian College of<br>sports physician<br>and then was promoted to associate<br>professorship in 2000 some um 13 years<br>ago he's had senior roles in the<br>undergraduate curriculum um and uh with<br>special responsibilities around student<br>mentorship and pastoral care and um has<br>been the perhaps the first full-time<br>academic Sports physician in<br>australasia uh and as we've already<br>heard uh LED um a range of national and<br>intern<br>committees um the highlights are really<br>for for from his career he's been<br>actively involved and it's interesting<br>what he puts as number one curriculum<br>design and academic convenor ship of the<br>first multi-disciplinary distant Tau<br>postgraduate Sports Medicine diploma in<br>austral Asia so clearly there's been a<br>focus on developing other people with<br>interest in sports medicine um the he's<br>had a sustained output in sport and<br>exercise medicine research one book<br>three monographs 19 invited book<br>chapters and 75 referee Journal articles<br>he's had ministerial advisory roles in<br>sports and exercise medicine um and<br>certainly including international travel<br>as an advisor to uh as a ministerial<br>advisor he's had International committee<br>appointments as the first New Zealander<br>to lead the medical committies in<br>swimming rugby and uh as we've heard the<br>world anti-doping agency and the Olympic<br>movement he's had the Royal honors which<br>I mentioned OB in 1995 uh companion of<br>the New Zealand order of Merit in 2007<br>for sustained services to Sport and<br>medicine he's now attended in various<br>capacity as athlete team physician chef<br>demission and medical commissioner to<br>nine um Summer Olympic Games so often<br>when I see him he's about to go<br>somewhere and it's usually to some um<br>sports event or the Olympics uh or the<br>anti-doping thing and uh so he comes and<br>goes and I always know that something<br>interesting is going to come back<br>usually an interesting story uh in any<br>circumstance that I've been with him you<br>can rely on him to actually have a story<br>that's appropriate to the moment uh<br>that's usually funny that's usually<br>epicate uh and in terms of social skills<br>he would rate in my top 10 people that I<br>know with good social skills so so if<br>you want somebody to get something done<br>if you want somebody to take a difficult<br>situation and manage it so that<br>everybody feels happy at the end of it<br>Dave Gerard's the man so it's really<br>with great pleasure uh that I um that I<br>introduce uh Dave for his inaugural<br>professorial lecture entitled in the<br>footsteps of galin uh bringing medicine<br>to Modern Gladiators a great title thank<br>well Vice Chancellor and uh Dean Barry<br>Taylor thank you very much I feel<br>overwhelmed by the presence of so many<br>people here this evening it's it's a<br>great honor and a privilege to stand in<br>front of you as a a new professor at uh<br>New Zealand's most outstanding<br>University and I don't think in the<br>academic world you can ask for much more<br>than<br>that my<br>presentation this evening is is all<br>about the journey and I know that's a a<br>hacked expression but really that's what<br>I'm here to tell you about the travels<br>I've had both figuratively and literally<br>in the area of sports medicine and it<br>seemed appropriate to me to begin with<br>uh something classical with apologies to<br>students of Classics to say something<br>about the esteemed father of sports<br>medicine one galin of pergamum pergamum<br>a small City on the aian sea and<br>pergamum their home and birthplace of<br>galin a Greek physician who traveled<br>widely and was influenced by hypocrates<br>amongst other<br>people galin was regaled as an excellent<br>physician and at the age of<br>28 received a very honorable and<br>esteemed appointment M to be the<br>physician to the school of Gladiators<br>which would be a little akin to um<br>gaining the position of Team physician<br>to the Highlanders in the city of den<br>Eden and I think in the audience we have<br>um Team physician to the Highlanders<br>here so Greg it's a pleasure to have you<br>tonight galin's career was interesting<br>in many many respects because he's<br>established a number of significant<br>medical Pathways which have become very<br>much embedded in modern sport and<br>exercise medicine galin was the first to<br>recognize diet Fitness hygiene and the<br>management of acute Sports Injury so it<br>was very very apparent that that galin<br>was truly a man of the moment a sport<br>and exercise physician par<br>Excellence he was promoted a little<br>after that after four years as the<br>physician to the school of Gladiators he<br>became the personal physician to marus<br>celus the then emperor of Rome so his<br>promotion was uh probably akin to that<br>of becoming a professor of sports<br>medicine and he obviously must have<br>earned that and earned his<br>Spurs much of what galin practiced and<br>taught in those days was in fact the<br>basis of modern sports tra mythology<br>and many of his philosophies and<br>practical comments and and acts of<br>management of sports injury have been<br>embedded in modern orthopedic surgery<br>and it is well written and and published<br>widely and accepted that galenic<br>influences still survive today in sports<br>traum<br>traumatology so I felt that I'd Begin by<br>drawing a few comparisons between the<br>days of galin and intending to Modern<br>Gladiators and gladiatorial<br>sports and I have a couple of examples<br>which I think par Excellence demonstrate<br>that we have perhaps come a distance but<br>then perhaps we haven't come that far<br>the first of these is a piece of Roman<br>statuary that uh that was found um in<br>the BS of Constantine in Rome and now<br>resid in the national museum in Rome<br>it's uh it's called the pugilist at rest<br>and and if you look closely you see how<br>well<br>um well sculpted this this piece is that<br>not only does he have the the the<br>cauliflower ear which is reminiscent of<br>modernday<br>gladiators but you look closely and the<br>the the<br>sculpture has actually depicted the<br>incisions as he has the many other<br>facial scars that are so accurately<br>replicated on the face of this battered<br>pugilist another piece of um Greek<br>pottery The Shard from um some ancient<br>archaeologic site demonstrates uh to<br>wrestlers here in in Fond Embrace and<br>the elbow of one causing a nose bleed or<br>epistaxis in this in this athlete not<br>too dissimilar to the sort of trauma<br>that we see on the field uh rugby and<br>rugby league today I'm not quite so sure<br>about this man in the top right hand<br>corner he looks as though he has been on<br>a combination of high energy drinks<br>pin so what about the Journey of<br>bringing sport to Medicine in New<br>Zealand well it all began right here in<br>deden a little over 50 years ago and<br>across the road in the red lecture<br>theater in the Scott Building the first<br>ever meeting of sports medicine New<br>Zealand the then New Zealand Federation<br>of sports medicine was<br>held there were a number of auspicious<br>members of the medical fraternity there<br>including a few whom you'll meet in a<br>subsequent<br>slide but just to put the New Zealand<br>development of sports medicine into<br>context we developed um a grouping that<br>had an interest in sport and exercise<br>medicine in the early 60s and consistent<br>with what was happening overseas the<br>first ever Sports Medicine Conference<br>held at the time of the San meritz<br>Winter Olympics the first Gathering of<br>sports Physicians was declared the<br>beginning of official Sports Medicine<br>thereafter International federations and<br>Regional associations were sprouting up<br>in Europe and America so New Zealand was<br>right there at the Forefront of<br>developing an interest in this area and<br>the interest can be put fairly and<br>squarely on the shoulders of one man<br>whom I consider to perhaps be one of our<br>most<br>unsung uh<br>alumni uh Sir Arthur paret an otago<br>student Road scholar resident at seln<br>College in<br>192021 born in mongui at the turn of<br>last<br>century became I think probably one of<br>our most<br>regaled<br>alumni Not only was he a graduate of<br>this medical school although in those<br>days you had to travel to complete your<br>medical studies he became a road scholar<br>and went to Oxford to complete his<br>medicine and whilst at Oxford he was<br>selected for the Olympic Games of<br>1924 and the film Buffs amongst you will<br>remember those Olympics in Paris with<br>the Chariots of Fire<br>Olympics and Arthur parret won a bronze<br>meters he subsequently continued his<br>studies and gained Fellowship of the<br>College of Surgeons and ultimately<br>became surgeon to the Royal household he<br>had a distinguish World War II<br>Korea and then in 1967 he returned to<br>New Zealand to become our first<br>homegrown governor<br>general and I think this University can<br>be doubly triy proud of one of its own<br>who whom I think achieved so much during<br>his lifetime Olympic Athlete scholar and<br>and certainly an outstanding<br>Statesman but whilst he was working as a<br>junior consultant at St Mary's<br>Hospital he met another otago medical<br>graduate Nori Jefferson who was<br>completing his Advanced Training in in<br>radiology and also Dr Maine smen another<br>otago graduate who was an an entist in<br>training and these two gentlemen engaged<br>with Arthur paret in a conversation in<br>19 the late 50s which culminated in Sir<br>Arthur coming to New Zealand in 1960 to<br>establish the formative group that we<br>know as Sports Medicine New Zealand<br>today and so I'd like to to pay a<br>particular tribute not only to Sir<br>Arthur par but also to the late Nar<br>Jefferson who passed away last December<br>at the age of 92 and an amazing man who<br>left a great legacy in this Hospital in<br>radiology at the same time there were<br>other distinguished Physicians and<br>surgeons from this Hospital left to<br>right associate professor John<br>heslop um associate professor Ted NY<br>who's who's often seen at Medical fora<br>uh and Grand rounds and perhaps tar is<br>here tonight I'm not sure um nari<br>Jefferson um and yours truly and very<br>very esteemed<br>company so where has contemporary Sports<br>Medicine taken us this is clearly a<br>burgeoning field as many of you will<br>know that uh teams require uh the best<br>of Professional Care and attention in a<br>number of different areas<br>sports medicine is now grown into a<br>specialist vocation with an austral<br>Asian College formed in the early '90s<br>and there has been also a departure from<br>tending to Elite athleticism and caring<br>for The Wider community and a number of<br>aspects of sports medicine research and<br>Publications do feature uh attitudes<br>towards Community<br>lifestyle sports medicine has also<br>become very research informed and as<br>I've already said uh applied to<br>Community<br>Health before I leave famous otaro<br>alumni I ought to mention another<br>outstanding contributor uh the late Dr<br>Jack Lovelock also a medical student<br>here also a road<br>scholar um went on to complete his<br>advanced studies and rehabilitative<br>Medicine in New York and sadly died at<br>the age age of of 39 as a consequence of<br>an accident in the New York underground<br>there is some contention as to whether<br>or not he slipped and fell or took his<br>own life in that tragic circumstance of<br>his death and that Intrigue will be with<br>him forever of course but he was<br>renowned for winning New Zealand's first<br>ever gold medal in the 1500s at the<br>Berlin in the 1500 meters at the Berlin<br>Olympics of 1936<br>and the shif the mission of that team<br>was none other than Sir Arthur paret and<br>I was engaged with Sir Arthur on a<br>number of occasions and was fortunate<br>enough to hear him talk about his<br>relationship with Jack Lovelock on the<br>occasion of 36 Olympic Games and the<br>amazing anecdotal reminiscence of Sir<br>Arthur PIR talking about love loock and<br>his preparation for that momentous<br>occasion so a little bit of extra<br>history that has its roots firmly<br>embedded here at the University of<br>otago along with clinical Sports<br>Medicine we must acknowledge the<br>elements of sports science that go to<br>inform the athletes in terms of<br>performance enhancement the physiology<br>of exercise the recognition and the<br>development of talent aspects of<br>coaching biomechanics nutrition and<br>psychology these are all elements which<br>are very much a part of the sports<br>medicine and science<br>armamentarium so too has the<br>literature blossomed and mushroomed and<br>there is a huge body of of scientific<br>and research informed literature out<br>there um in in all the major continents<br>so we have a wonderful opportunity to<br>have our work peer-reviewed and<br>published in journals which maybe 10 or<br>20 years ago were not particularly<br>profound in their impact factors but now<br>we have journals that are rating very<br>highly and attract some acclaimed uh<br>contribution to the area of sport and<br>Medicine<br>research and the angle that has become<br>so self-evident more recently is as I<br>mentioned the departure from Elite Sport<br>and looking at Community Health and the<br>prescription of exercise as medicine and<br>many students at this University who<br>study not only in medical school but in<br>the schools of physical education and<br>physiotherapy get a spattering<br>of the development of<br>exercise uh as a therapeutic advantage<br>and I think New Zealand led the way in<br>the development of something we call the<br>green prescription many years ago where<br>GPS were encouraged to prescribe<br>exercise to supplement and complement<br>their patients uh<br>medications and at this point I would<br>like to pay a particular note of of uh<br>of acknowledgement to the contribution<br>made by DR HH Osborne and his his first<br>lieutenant Dr Peter bird Who currently<br>um under the um the tutelage of of of of<br>HH run this program and run it very very<br>well we have a postgraduate program now<br>which is truly<br>multi-disciplinary and I acknowledge the<br>work that HH who was a sports physician<br>in his own right and and Peter Bert who<br>has come through the school of of<br>general practice hard hard kns and as a<br>an Olympic team doctor himself know know<br>what it's like to manage these problems<br>both at the elite level and also in<br>terms of general<br>practice so exercise and health has been<br>acknowledged for many many years and<br>this is not a new initiative and I think<br>in either Physicians and the audience<br>irrespective of your chosen specialty<br>will acknowledge that more and more<br>often our patients deserve a closer<br>scrutiny in terms of their lifestyle<br>their health choices and and so on but<br>it was Galen in fact who first put some<br>significance to this all those many many<br>years ago so Galen too as I mentioned<br>earlier was not only the physician to<br>the school of gladiators but he was<br>applying his sport and exercise medicine<br>to the community at large and in a in a<br>recent article in the Lancet um John<br>bman has has captured many of these<br>sentiments and brought them into the the<br>21st<br>century at the same time it was hypocrit<br>who who coined this um very significant<br>uh element of balancing the the right<br>amount of nourishment and exercise not<br>too little not too much and we would<br>have found the safest way to health<br>these are attitudes which I think are<br>coming into contemporary<br>medicine but the landmark research I<br>think those that look at the literature<br>will agree was the work done by Jerry<br>Morris and his colleagues in the 1950s<br>in London when he looked at a cohort of<br>London bus drivers and conductors the<br>significant difference between this<br>group of men from a similar<br>socioeconomic background was that the<br>conductors were up and down the stairs<br>all day punching tickets and uh doing<br>their job whilst the drivers were<br>sitting in a very sedentary situation he<br>followed them in a longitudinal sense<br>and developed some of the first Concepts<br>that we now associate with um and and<br>apply to Modern exercise medicine so<br>that particular study I think was the<br>landmark today for for what has<br>followed but as um Barry Taylor referred<br>to earlier pediatric Sports Medicine the<br>the Genesis of many conditions We<br>Believe begin in early life has been the<br>the subject of a lot of very close<br>scrutiny uh issues that we consider<br>today as being very very significant in<br>our Western population obesity sedentary<br>Lifestyles the choice of nutrition the<br>development of conditions such as type 2<br>diabetes and cardiovascular disease<br>having a very strong um a very strong<br>influence in the way that we learn from<br>leaving that subject for a moment and<br>making a complete departure to to<br>another part of my Sporting Life and<br>involvement I have often reminisced over<br>the fact that in 1964 as a fledgling<br>butterfly swimmer at the Tokyo Olympics<br>I was completely overed by the<br>circumstances and and the Olympic Games<br>but I have some wonderful wonderful<br>memories and I I stopped to think when I<br>was in in London in<br>2012 as a medical<br>commissioner to think back to what had<br>changed over that half a century and<br>there have been some very significant<br>changes that I'll highlight in a<br>moment but a couple of things that I<br>thought were of significant interest<br>were that in Tokyo in<br>1964 there were just over 5,000<br>competing athletes of whom<br>only 670 were women<br>the remaining 4 and a half thousand more<br>men in London there were a little over<br>10 a half thousand athletes by this<br>stage there were 4,600 women and 5,800<br>men so the numbers were were were more<br>evenly<br>balanced what struck me though was in<br>Tokyo in 1964 there was no security<br>around the Olympic Village you could<br>wander in and out at will wearing your<br>tracksuit as the only means of<br>identification but there was a very<br>formidable and very high barbwire fence<br>around the women's<br>compound so getting into the female<br>compound was something um that that many<br>of those<br>um 4,500 males attempted to achieve it<br>was rumored that the the height of the<br>perim the F perimeter fence was exactly<br>1 cm greater than the existing world<br>record pole bolt<br>height which I have to confess was<br>attempted on many occasions during those<br>Olympics by the time we got to London<br>the the there was no women's compound<br>but there was certainly a high level of<br>security around the Olympic Village and<br>this of course has grown and has become<br>adapted as a consequence of the high<br>security that that the International<br>Community now comes to accept when we<br>travel and certainly when you have<br>athletes from over 200 different<br>countries in in a confined space the<br>need for security is self-evident and<br>that of course all had its Genesis and<br>the tragedy of the Munich Olympics in<br>1972 so what else has changed in modern<br>sport over that half century well it<br>would be a surprise to you all if I<br>didn't make some mention of the scourge<br>which I believe is is still the greatest<br>Scourge to modern sport and that of drug<br>misuse use there have been some<br>influential changes of the last decade<br>um the Integrity of sport is is is<br>attempting to be maintained and ethical<br>standards uh are being sought in a<br>number of different<br>areas one of the game Breakers of course<br>was the development of the world<br>anti-doping agency and I'm proud to show<br>a picture here of the leadership by yet<br>another New Zealander to this August<br>body this is David Helman a former uh<br>Wellington Barrister unfortunately he<br>didn't have the wisdom to study at otago<br>I think he gained his lore degree from a<br>university north of here but not<br>withstanding that David has demonstrated<br>some significant leadership in the world<br>anti-doping agency and continues to do<br>do so and has held in very very high<br>regard and it probably would surprise<br>some of you for me not to mention<br>something about Armstrong and the Legacy<br>that he left well it's hard to know<br>where to<br>start we could we could acknowledge the<br>sadness of a an outstanding athlete<br>falling foul to the system becoming<br>seduced seduced by the cudos by the<br>financial gain by the the moment of<br>sport a man who had a particular<br>personality that probably made him a<br>good athlete but at the same time made<br>him a bit of a bully somewhat narcissist<br>istic somewhat self-centered somewhat<br>very much a part of my way or the<br>highway and the young men who joined his<br>team had to comply there was never any<br>option but Armstrong was also aided and<br>abetted by a group of scientists and<br>Physicians his meaningful path to so<br>many victories was aided by the use of a<br>number per of<br>performance-enhancing uh scientific<br>interventions including the use of micro<br>does of EPO arthropo and the powerful<br>Red Cell producing hormone the use of<br>anabolic steroids like testosterone the<br>use of cortico steroids the use of blood<br>transfusions he would be receiving a<br>liter of his own blood uh at the end of<br>a busy day on the bike so it would be<br>like pulling your car into the service<br>station and asking them to pump the eyes<br>up check the oil fill the tank and uh<br>that's exactly what was happening to<br>Armstrong every night his tank would be<br>topped<br>up as a consequence of this certain<br>things happened Armstrong never returned<br>a positive test but there were certain<br>other indicators of his lack of<br>compliance with ethical normal accepted<br>fair play in sport and one of the them<br>was being picked up with what we now<br>call The Athlete biological passport and<br>this is just a snapshot for you to a<br>little bit of a taste of of what can<br>happen today Armstrong never returned a<br>positive test for any ban substance in<br>his urine or blood but he did<br>demonstrate on a number of occasions<br>certain aberration in his normal blood<br>profile and here this is not Armstrong's<br>profile but just to give you an<br>indication uh you you see a very<br>uh a clear upper and lower red line and<br>this is a measure of hemoglobin in the<br>blood so uh normal variables in the<br>population and within this the Blue Line<br>indicates the rather erratic hemoglobin<br>levels of an<br>athlete whom you might suspect if you<br>time these aberration to particular<br>events may have been using some blood<br>boosting mechanism be it EPO or blood<br>transfusion<br>to build his hemoglobin to to a level<br>consistent with that because it wasn't<br>consistent with the level of<br>physiological deprivation and and um<br>output that would have been seen in the<br>course of a a tu def France Race For<br>example so if these if these Peaks and<br>troughs um didn't fit a physiologic norm<br>and they could be accounted for by an<br>event then suspicions are cast and this<br>profile now has been the Genesis of what<br>we call non-analytical sanction so<br>athletes can be Target tested and<br>followed up very very closely if these<br>aberration appear in their biological<br>passport and these SS are collected over<br>many many<br>months but where the future challenges<br>lie who knows the word on the street is<br>that it's Gene doping it's going to be<br>the future for genetic engineering that<br>will make the difference and where that<br>will lead us I'm just not quite sure<br>because at the moment there's no way of<br>Li with with any reliability of<br>detecting these<br>changes but profiting from Sport and<br>fixing matches and and the moral and<br>social Integrity this this infers isn't<br>just a question of saying no to drugs or<br>doping we have seen over many many years<br>the intrusion of politics into Sport and<br>there are many many cases that we could<br>we could reflect<br>upon I guess for me it was a no-brainer<br>when I was invited to make a<br>contribution to the otago foreign policy<br>school um an annual event which which is<br>is well attend attended by International<br>authorities and on this particular<br>occasion um the theme was um foreign<br>policy and Sport and I was asked to make<br>comments and and Reflections on<br>experiences that I'd had over the years<br>where where it was self-evident that<br>foreign policy<br>was intruding into Sport and I chose two<br>case studies and I won't bore you with<br>all the detail but just as a snapshot<br>the first of these was the Berlin<br>Olympic games which was nothing more<br>than a um as as is captured here Aryan<br>Sport and Nazi propaganda uh captured on<br>film the history of the 36 Olympics not<br>standing Jack lovelock's outstanding win<br>was uh highlighted by the performance of<br>the black American athlete Jesse Owens<br>the um the disgruntled Hitler leaving<br>the stadium and absolute dis disgust<br>when you know a black athlete was<br>beating his Arian athletes we saw for<br>the first time this depicted in an<br>outstanding movie and a film of the<br>Olympic Games which those who are far<br>more expert than I to comment say is<br>Stand Alone the the archetypal Olympic<br>film and if any of you ever get a chance<br>to see it this is uh an outstanding<br>movie which depicts the Olympic Games in<br>in it's all in all its Glory but behind<br>that was the the the charade was the the<br>political influence of of Nazi<br>Germany and the other era to which I I I<br>refer and which I used as a as a case<br>study was one that I'd been personally<br>involved in because I was swimming at<br>the time of the East German strength and<br>performance in swimming and track and<br>field and as an international athlete we<br>were OB observing the success of the<br>East German athletes and at the time<br>nobody had any idea why it was that East<br>Germany and in particular their women<br>could be so successful on the track and<br>in the<br>pool and it wasn't until the unification<br>of Germany in 1989 when the sty reports<br>became public fodder that we realized<br>that sport in the gdr was fueled by the<br>use of anabolic Eng enic steroids and<br>other performance-enhancing substances<br>uh described by many authorities as<br>medical Alchemy and chemical field tests<br>with significant long-term consequences<br>to the young women in particular for<br>whom uh the their government and their<br>Sports Medicine fraternity exposed them<br>and there were many many consequences of<br>this and and the one that I draw to your<br>attention now is is that of of um Heidi<br>craer seen here on on on your left uh as<br>a competing East German shot putter in<br>1984 and this is her today as Andreas<br>ker living in Berlin um looking<br>significantly different the consequences<br>for her of of a decade of exposure to<br>masculinizing bodybuilding hormones was<br>so significant that she chose to change<br>her phenotype she couldn't change her<br>genotype of course but phenotypically<br>she became a male and is Comfortably<br>living the life of Andreas ker but<br>reflects often and when invited to the<br>media reflects upon the consequences of<br>those years of of drugs in sport in East<br>Germany and just as a little postcript<br>because people say to me well did those<br>drugs really make that much<br>difference it's a fact that's lost on a<br>lot of people that our current reigning<br>Olympic champion Valerie Adams twice<br>Olympic champion now four times world<br>champion undefeated in her last 34<br>appearances is still a meter and a half<br>behind the world<br>record which was set in 1987 by an East<br>German shot<br>putter and if Val had been competing in<br>1980 at the Moscow Olympics she would<br>have just snuck in into third place so I<br>think that's a very sobering reminder of<br>how important it was to win and to win<br>at all<br>costs so how have we in sports medicine<br>begun to inform Sport and exercise<br>through our research and and I have been<br>proud and delighted on many occasions to<br>be invited to contribute to a number of<br>collaborations on this campus and<br>internationally and I've just at random<br>chosen a few few of these that I feel<br>I've I've enjoyed the personal<br>involvement in that has resulted in some<br>significant research and some important<br>publication the first of these looked at<br>the inactivity in New Zealand children<br>and it was the comment that Professor<br>Taylor Made earlier that we have<br>combined in research we looked at a<br>longitudinal study of of a cohort of of<br>um a Birth Cohort from Queen Mary<br>Hospital here in denen 244 youngsters<br>aged between three and five and we<br>followed them longitudinally in what<br>became uh the flame study the acronym uh<br>referring to family lifestyle activity<br>movement and eating and it's been a a<br>real pleasure for me to see that the<br>work of of Rachel Taylor and particular<br>has continued in this area and we're<br>getting some very meaningful data and<br>some significant comment made about how<br>important it is to continue to encourage<br>what about this business of young people<br>and their consideration for the use of<br>of uh drugs and<br>Sport um I'm I'm pleased<br>and acknowledge his presence in the<br>audience tonight of Professor Ken hjj um<br>Ken and colleagues um invited me to<br>contribute to this paper which looked at<br>psychological mechanisms which fueled<br>the peer pressure and the development of<br>attitudes which consider were considered<br>important in in the developing concept<br>of whether a young person would consider<br>utilizing performance-enhancing<br>substances or<br>not um 224 competitive athletes<br>contributed to the data that we obtained<br>for the study and it was self-evident<br>that moral disengagement and forms of<br>rationalization were very significant<br>amongst the motivation for the use of<br>substance es that were prohibited in<br>sport and what about sports medicine<br>ethics because this is something that<br>we're all mindful<br>of um doctors who are subjected to the<br>the thrill and the privilege of<br>traveling to Olympic Games being doctors<br>to the All Blacks traveling with super<br>15 teams and meeting the rock stars of<br>sport can sometimes be seduced by what<br>we term the fan<br>syndrome and in completing her PhD Dr<br>Lindley Anderson whom I think is in the<br>audience tonight um looked very very<br>closely at professional boundaries<br>external influences that the doctors<br>have to consider influences today that<br>come from the coach sponsors and the<br>players<br>themselves influences that make doctors<br>act outside the boundaries of of normal<br>ethical<br>behavior and I think from linley's<br>research and subsequent research that's<br>being done in the department of Bio<br>ethics I I feel very reassured that our<br>community of teen physicians in New<br>Zealand is certainly abiding by high<br>ethical<br>standards but watch the space the<br>pressures are always there and what<br>about things like the indiscriminate of<br>something like indiscriminate use of<br>something as simple as an<br>anti-inflammatory<br>drug substances that are purchased over<br>the counter um Professor Rob Walker and<br>colleagues and I collaborated some years<br>ago now Rob when we looked at the impact<br>that these drugs have on renal<br>function so often seen as very benign<br>and simple means of of anti-inflammatory<br>Relief pain relief these substances have<br>a very profound and systemic effect and<br>particularly when they are taken in the<br>cocktail and the setting of of um<br>dehydration and extreme sport uh there<br>are significant impacts on the health of<br>our kidneys and consequences that we<br>have seen turn up in our emergency<br>departments and Hospital Wards so I<br>think we learned a lot from that study<br>and despite the fact that we got out<br>there and campaigned to request that<br>that coaches strength and conditioning<br>experts and physiotherapists are not<br>responsible for handing these things out<br>the these drugs are still available<br>readily a little bit like the recent<br>controversy over the use of of<br>hypnosedatives the athletes will will<br>have their own philosophy on how these<br>things are used so that was a very<br>salutary study that I think has led to<br>other research in the area and then<br>finally a study that I was a part of<br>some years ago with colle from exercise<br>science and the school of physical<br>education when we looked at um<br>supplementation with a with a deer<br>velvet Antler Extract and look this is a<br>talk in its own right<br>supplementation neutraceutical natural<br>products the markets are flooded with<br>these substances today often very poorly<br>researched the science behind them is is<br>very shallow not substantiated by any<br>significant randomized blinded<br>controlled study and I think it's very<br>important to get this message across to<br>Young athletes that despite what U sir<br>Bob Charles and Sir Colin mes have to<br>say about their deal of Albert an antler<br>medicating<br>self-medication our research showed no<br>significant benefits in a group of 30<br>fit healthy young men and women who were<br>the final piece of research that I'm<br>going to refer to is something that's<br>very contemporary and something that<br>we're actually in the process of<br>completing now and it looks at the<br>clinical obligations to the the safety<br>of endurance athletes in particular um a<br>group from exercise science and also the<br>department of physics I acknowledge<br>associate professor AAS Sun for his<br>valuable contribution but in particular<br>Cal Bradford<br>and Jim Cotter from the FED school as<br>exercise scientists par Excellence these<br>guys have enabled me to look very<br>closely at safety in aquatic sport we're<br>looking at swimming 10 km the equivalent<br>of the the terrestrial Marathon the<br>newest aquatic event on the Olympic<br>calendar athletes who will spend 2 hours<br>swimming for 10 km in some very<br>inhospitable environments water temp<br>temperatures in excess of 30° Centigrade<br>ambient temperatures around 35 36 and<br>for 2 hours they keep going so we looked<br>at the hazards the the the health<br>hazards and the prospect for hypothermia<br>and I'm pleased to say we utilize the<br>we undertook a number of measures and<br>you saw them there we we measured the<br>ereal temperature by way of a um ereal<br>ther and that in itself was a<br>significant<br>challenge but like all good researchers<br>I subjected myself to the<br>same in<br>dignity and I didn't swim for two hours<br>I I took the easy option and the 1500 M<br>equivalent which was a 20 minute swim<br>but you'll see from our results here<br>just very very quickly we had three<br>different temperatures 20° C 27 and<br>32 uh the swimmers completed a 20 minute<br>a 60 Minute and a 120 minute swim which<br>were the surrogates for a 1500 meter a<br>5K and a 10K event and you'll see not<br>surprisingly that the ereal temperatures<br>Rose not quite so much they plateaued in<br>the at at the 20° temperatures but there<br>was a significant elevation nobody<br>exceeding the core temperature that we<br>had ethical approval to take them to<br>which was<br>39.9<br>de so we we were we were safe in that<br>respect we we were monitoring them all<br>the way um one of the participants is<br>actually in the audience right now and I<br>don't think heish has forgiven me for<br>the dignities of the rectal thermometry<br>but um well it's all in the the for the<br>benefits of Science and he<br>understands hamish's heart rate Rose<br>more significantly over the 1500 M than<br>it did um over the 5K and 10K equivalent<br>and you'll see here uh demonstrated<br>heart rates rising and plateauing these<br>athletes are super fit and they can<br>sustain uh effort for a duration of up<br>to 2 hours<br>one of the more important facets of our<br>study was to look at how the athletes<br>perceived themselves so that when they<br>felt extremely<br>uncomfortable on the y- AIS here a scale<br>a tested scale demonstrating extreme<br>uncomfort to<br>comfortable um did their degree of being<br>uncomfortable match the objective data<br>that we were receiving here and you'll<br>see there was a linear correlation on<br>almost every occasion at all<br>temperatures which indicated to us that<br>yes the athletes do retain the ability<br>to perceive that they are feeling<br>stressed that they are feeling hot<br>they're feeling<br>uncomfortable so bringing medicine to<br>sport has for me been a very<br>exhilarating ride you've heard snapshots<br>of um part of my journey this evening<br>and and I was honored by the the<br>introduction by the Vice Chancellor and<br>the dean it has for me been a very long<br>and exciting ride we've looked at the<br>clinical application of lessons from the<br>human under stress and applied these to<br>clinical medicine we've considered the<br>athlete as the patient which is the<br>common um relationship that people make<br>between Sport and medicine they think of<br>us pandering to the wants and needs of<br>pradon athletes who get sore knees after<br>running marathons or fall over on the<br>Rugby field and need to be tended that's<br>true that's part of sports medicine but<br>so too is the patient often an athlete<br>and the wonderful performance of<br>athletes at in disability sports<br>performance at the Olympic Games the<br>Special Olympics and the like<br>occasionally and often we consider and<br>Marvel at the exercise boundaries that<br>are that are exceeded by many athletes<br>so the the sports science aspect is very<br>important and then we can apply these to<br>to exercise prescription to patients<br>lead and in conclusion it would be wrong<br>for me not to make several significant<br>acknowledgements to academic colleagues<br>whom I've had the pleasure of working<br>with over the years and many of them<br>here tonight and I'm grateful for that<br>to the general staff that we've worked<br>with and in my current position in the<br>department of the dean uh the most<br>Charming team of general staff you could<br>ever wish to to meet and whose support<br>for me has been absolutely unstinting<br>and I'm grateful for them and their<br>support as I come into the office every<br>day to the students from whom I continue<br>to learn I learned so much from them as<br>a a a Student Health Physician and I've<br>learned and continue to learn from my<br>students as I engage in teaching and<br>research and to the university a<br>university that's insightful enough to<br>consider that the the association with a<br>super 15 rugby team enhan is our image<br>there are re research prospects there<br>are countless opportunities for free<br>advertising which haven't been lost on<br>the vice Chancellor I know but bearing<br>all those things in mind the University<br>of otago has a proud tradition in sport<br>and some of the alumni to whom I've<br>referred I think reflect this wonderful<br>wonderful balance developing leadership<br>and Sport and producing young men and<br>women who are leaders in<br>not make mention of<br>um the people that have really stuck it<br>out with me all the way and particularly<br>that lady in the middle who's endured<br>many many years of my tramping around<br>the world and and uh the various<br>requirements of my job and and I love<br>them all dearly and I'm grateful that<br>they're here<br>good evening my name is Rob Walker and<br>I'm the head of medicine and fortunately<br>Dave is a member of my department so<br>we're very pleased to have him as a<br>member of the Department of<br>Medicine and congratulate David on the<br>award of his personal chair it is<br>Thoroughly welld deserved and you've<br>heard an excellent rendition tonight of<br>just some of Dave's tremendous abilities<br>and his commitment to<br>Academia and it's not just in his chosen<br>field of sports medicine as you've heard<br>but also this cheer is for recognition<br>of his outstanding teaching abilities<br>and his pastoral care particularly that<br>of our students for many many years<br>David had a superb role as the dean of<br>student affairs and there's been many<br>many students that he's helped get<br>through what is a very tough course so<br>this is overwhelming recognition of all<br>those attributes</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
