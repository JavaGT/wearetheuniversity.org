bryce<br>edwards<br>who was obviously well known in new<br>zealand political<br>circles through his um commentary<br>power and conflict the key issues in<br>politics<br>says dr edwards in my teaching and<br>research i'm always asking questions<br>about who really runs new zealand<br>how is policy really made by governments<br>who has the most power in society<br>and how our resources divided up in<br>society i aim to promote critical<br>thinking and a consideration of a<br>diversity of points of views<br>and ways of understanding politics so<br>tonight's lecture is politics of scandal<br>bryce<br>hello everyone um as you can see i'm not<br>the most professional<br>public speaker ever i've arrived here by<br>running up from the railway station<br>this trip up from dunedin has really<br>nicely coincided with<br>the release today of nikki hagar's new<br>book and so i've just been at the<br>the launch for that and i got a bit too<br>involved in it all<br>and um finally had to jump on a bus and<br>come here and run up from the railway<br>station so<br>that's what if i'm looking flustered<br>it's partly because of that<br>i'm not the only one very good so i will<br>talk a bit about the book because it<br>nicely coincides with<br>the topic tonight dirty politics how<br>attack<br>politics is poisoning new zealand's<br>political environment<br>so that's the book that's just come out<br>and i think we'll be talking about it<br>quite a bit over the next few days and<br>weeks before election day<br>okay so if i can work this machine<br>okay so really the question i'm looking<br>at tonight over the next<br>40 50 whatever minutes is the question<br>of whether politics is getting dirtier<br>and whether this election campaign we're<br>currently in is is the most aggressive<br>one in living memory so<br>the talk i'm giving um i guess i guess<br>isn't the most well-crafted one ever<br>it's not one i've given before<br>it's a paper that i've been slowly<br>working over<br>over the last few years on the issue of<br>scandals and corruption and some of the<br>more<br>aggressive parts of politics and so<br>the paper's really only half finished<br>hence my lecture might<br>seem a bit half finished tonight as well<br>so it's a work in progress<br>but hopefully you're getting something<br>fresh tonight at least and<br>when rodney asked me to talk i'd just<br>written a column for the new zealand<br>herald online<br>asking whether this election was going<br>to descend into the<br>the nastiest most scary um not<br>scaremongering<br>scandal-mongering election campaign ever<br>and so<br>when he asked me to do a talk i thought<br>oh well oh that's a<br>topic i'm really interested in so i'll<br>try and come up with some things<br>to talk about about this and it's<br>because i do have an interest<br>in issues of corruption in particular<br>i'm a board member on<br>for transparency international new<br>zealand so that's where i'm doing<br>um some research on corruption um<br>and it's good to see some other people<br>from transparency international here<br>tonight<br>um but of course i follow election<br>campaigns quite closely<br>that's part of my job that's part of<br>what i do<br>so i have been noticing that there's<br>been increasing<br>scandals in politics over the last<br>well two decades really in new zealand<br>politics but particularly even more so<br>over recent years and it is culminating<br>this year<br>in a particularly aggressive negative<br>campaign so that's what i thought i'd<br>try and unpack some of those issues and<br>evaluate<br>what it's all about i chose a<br>deliberately provocative title<br>throwing in those words sex corruption<br>and lies<br>because i know everyone's interested in<br>them i'm interested in them you're<br>interested in them<br>and that's why you're here tonight and<br>it's kind of<br>supposed to epitomise really this idea<br>that<br>we are actually interested in wrongdoing<br>we're interested in allegations<br>and things about yeah sex so um you know<br>it is<br>uh sensationalist or to some extent<br>um yeah provocative<br>so like i said it's actually been a wave<br>of increasing scandals and controversies<br>that we've been experiencing<br>about personalities about personal<br>behavior<br>over um yeah the last 20 years but it's<br>been an international<br>wave as well we're not the only country<br>that's experiencing uh outbreak and<br>explosion of scandals<br>but so you can take that as a given<br>already that what we're experiencing in<br>new zealand has parallels everywhere<br>but there's a few other aspects that i<br>want to talk about over the next 40<br>minutes or so and<br>um explaining how scandal<br>the scandalization of politics is<br>increasing uh<br>for a few other reasons as well as um<br>just contagion from what's happening<br>globally<br>it's also the fact that we're now under<br>um well we no longer have just two<br>parties<br>we have a multi-party system ever since<br>the late 80s we started having new<br>parties coming onto the scene<br>that's been a breakup of the monopoly<br>which has had an effect on<br>the shift to proportional representation<br>again<br>brought in that well kind of solidified<br>solidified the um the multi-party system<br>and has had a big impact on what<br>more centrally i think is some<br>ideological<br>convergence the fact that parties are<br>shifting more towards the middle of the<br>political spectrum they're focusing less<br>on policy<br>than ever before that's what i'm going<br>to talk about as well and how that's fit<br>into<br>scandal politics of course there's been<br>changes in the media<br>the whole tenor of how media have their<br>relationships with politicians<br>it's a more adversarial relationship and<br>yeah globally there's been some changes<br>which i'll come back to but i guess my<br>main<br>argument is this this point here<br>and that is that allegations about<br>corruption or scandals in general<br>have become a political weapon for<br>politicians<br>politicians electioneer they campaign<br>on finding wrongdoing on their opponents<br>and then towards the end i just want to<br>talk about or is scandal politics a good<br>thing or a bad thing<br>i think there's arguments both ways we<br>can't say that this is all bad or it's<br>all good<br>we need to evaluate different scandals<br>okay so i guess this cartoon just i'm<br>going to try and be quite visual tonight<br>and i don't want to bore you with too<br>much monologue this cartoon is<br>really expressing that main point that i<br>was just talking about<br>this is from 2008 it's pete hodgson<br>who was the labour party campaign<br>manager<br>and he's managed to find some dirt on<br>his opposition<br>and to me that conveys a lot about<br>politics in the last few decades and<br>it's not to be mean to pete hodgson or<br>the labour party what i'm really trying<br>to express tonight is that all<br>politicians all political parties<br>are focused on the scandals and focused<br>on finding wrongdoing<br>um by their opponents and it's about the<br>digging for dirt it's about<br>trying to find out the discrepancies<br>between what their opponents say<br>and what they do so what is scandal<br>it's a in some ways it's a difficult uh<br>term to define and so i just wanted to<br>say something about what scandal isn't<br>because sometimes it's equated with<br>corruption and i am talking about<br>corruption tonight but that's just one<br>form of<br>scandal and of course you can have<br>corruption without it becoming a scandal<br>as well<br>if it's not detected and scandal<br>definitely doesn't equal controversy<br>some sometimes does i mean i guess most<br>scandals are controversial<br>but just because there's a major public<br>dispute about something doesn't mean<br>it's a scandal<br>in particular if there's major policy<br>fights<br>going on in politics that might you know<br>have a lot of tension<br>it might have a lot of hostility and<br>polarization but it doesn't mean it's a<br>scandal<br>so even something like the current<br>debate over foreign land sales<br>you know someone might say it's<br>scandalous but it doesn't really fit the<br>definition of a scandal<br>it's more it's more about a policy<br>dispute<br>also i want to draw attention over the<br>next few minutes i guess<br>to the fact that there's some other<br>changes in the way that politics<br>operates<br>that kind of goes along with this growth<br>of scandal and<br>again it's coming back to what nikki<br>hagar is talking about<br>in his book and that's the aggression<br>and perhaps underhand tactics that are<br>being used<br>in election campaigns and it's the focus<br>on the gaffes<br>trying to highlight where people make<br>mistakes<br>it's the dirty tactics it's the negative<br>advertising<br>slurs and character assassination but<br>not necessarily scandal<br>scandal in my view is something<br>whereby there's a transgress<br>transgression of<br>the morals of the public so it doesn't<br>mean that a law has been broken<br>but it means that the public in some way<br>has significant revulsion or feels that<br>the morality has been transgressed by<br>so sex um i'm going to talk too much<br>about sex<br>even though i've put it in the title<br>because i think in new zealand politics<br>it hasn't been a big part of our<br>scandals and<br>traditionally new zealanders don't take<br>a huge interest in the personal lives of<br>politicians<br>so if anything we see a lot of<br>uh sexual and proprietary or<br>um you know potentially scandalous<br>parts of the lives of politicians that<br>goes unreported<br>and is often quite unknown by the public<br>and so here's just a list of those first<br>three things of where they have been<br>quite well known at least amongst the<br>sort of political class or the<br>wellington beltway<br>of politicians in what could have been<br>sex scandals<br>but they don't get widely distributed<br>unlike<br>say it would have happened in some other<br>countries like the us<br>perhaps or lots of other countries so<br>muldoon was you know well known for<br>for his affairs and his heavy drinking<br>it was never reported about in the media<br>longi of course had a long-running<br>affair with his speech writer margaret<br>pope<br>the media the press gallery at<br>parliament knew about that<br>but there was a feeling that that was a<br>private matter even though she<br>was in a position of power it still<br>didn't come out<br>until long his wife naomi actually<br>and more recently you've had lots of<br>allegations about<br>don faires sorry don brash's<br>alleged affair with diane foreman from<br>the business roundtable back<br>in well the mid 2000s<br>again never really reported about by the<br>media even though<br>lots of taunts about in parliament and<br>lots of gossip about it<br>we'll come back to why perhaps the media<br>haven't focused too much on that<br>but there have been some areas that the<br>media have exploited<br>sexual issues<br>you know one of the obvious ones is<br>truth<br>um less restrained than some of the<br>other mainstream media the truth<br>newspaper<br>exposed marilyn waring as being a<br>lesbian back in 1975 when she was in<br>parliament of course it didn't ruin her<br>career anyway anyway<br>i guess a much more nasty episode in new<br>zealand political history was<br>the outing of colin moyle by the prime<br>minister uh<br>in the early 1980s and<br>the prime minister in the house raised<br>the fact that the police had<br>uh investigated him for homosexual<br>activity which of course was illegal at<br>the time<br>so that did become reported more<br>recently you've had graham capel<br>this guy in the caricature there who was<br>the leader of a christian party the<br>christian heritage party for about 14<br>years<br>and a campaigner on moral issues when he<br>was eventually<br>convicted and imprisoned for sexual<br>offences on<br>children that was widely reported and<br>his party had to<br>essentially disband richard worth<br>back in 2009<br>got into some trouble and some sexually<br>related activity<br>john key essentially made him resign<br>from parliament<br>resigned as a minister and then resigned<br>from parliament<br>and then more recently we've had the<br>darren hughes affair<br>again we never really got to the bottom<br>of all that but<br>it was certainly sufficient controversy<br>that he again resigned from parliament<br>and then more recently the len brown<br>affair exposed initially by<br>bloggers again coming back to what this<br>so there have been some sex scandals but<br>generally as i said there's a culture<br>in new zealand traditionally of fair<br>play where<br>the media voters parliamentarians<br>parties<br>feel that what goes on in politicians<br>private lives<br>should stay there and unless it's<br>impacting on their<br>political job unless there's some sort<br>of degree of<br>hypocrisy involved that it's not for<br>debate<br>and that's been quite a convention<br>especially amongst labour and national<br>politicians<br>for many decades that you don't bring<br>family members or family life<br>into the debates in parliament you don't<br>campaign on<br>anything that the the opposition do in<br>their private life<br>and of course i think there's a cultural<br>aspect to this as well in the sense that<br>i think new zealanders are just a bit<br>less<br>parent about issues of sex and politics<br>and less interested in general i believe<br>than perhaps in other cultures<br>what's been more important when it comes<br>to<br>sex scandals is how the issue has been<br>politically managed<br>and that's where there's been more skype<br>for politicians to campaign<br>say for example on the richard worth<br>issue or the darren hughes<br>it became more public when there was<br>seemed to be something lacking in the<br>way that the leaders of those parties<br>had dealt with the issue<br>so from the case in the case of darren<br>hughes phil goff had known about<br>the criminal investigation by the police<br>for many weeks and you know supposedly<br>he hadn't done anything about it<br>that was then what was criticized by his<br>opponents<br>and so as so often in scandals<br>transgression but the way it's been<br>managed that the politicians<br>as we'll talk about a bit later there's<br>been escalations<br>so even though i'd say that sex scandals<br>haven't been a big part of politics they<br>are starting to become more so<br>we are getting the private lives being<br>debated a bit more<br>in the political sphere and as i'll come<br>back to in 2005 you started to see a<br>real<br>increase in that when don brash was the<br>leader of the opposition and helen clark<br>the prime minister<br>and um you had a lot of<br>um rumor and we know about the prime<br>minister and her husband<br>and also about the leader of the<br>opposition and there were a lot of<br>taunts that started to be thrown around<br>in parliament amongst mps and it got to<br>one stage where<br>basically labour and national came<br>together and said we've got to<br>you know call down on this because we're<br>all going to lose<br>and so as we're supported at the time by<br>tbnz<br>mps across the political spectrum are<br>calling on each other to pull back from<br>the brink<br>of what's been seen as the descent into<br>the kind of tabloid exposure of<br>politicians personal lives<br>seen in britain in the united states so<br>that's<br>a bit of a theme that we'll come back to<br>that<br>politicians themselves don't necessarily<br>want scandal<br>to be out there in the public and often<br>they will collude<br>and try to call in the<br>attack dogs and stop scandal politics<br>exploding<br>but i want to really<br>draw attention i guess to that electoral<br>gain is a very powerful motivator for<br>politicians<br>and so they can't entirely um restrain<br>themselves from<br>um highlighting wrongdoing by their<br>opponents<br>and and here's just one example of<br>phil goff during that richard worth<br>scandal<br>he made a lot of ground about that<br>and um and here's one cynical view from<br>tim's tom<br>scott saying that yes he's being states<br>person<br>or being like a state's person in the<br>top half<br>but perhaps if we really knew what was<br>going on<br>we could see that his motives were less<br>sincere<br>again around that time i just said of<br>don bresh being leader<br>lots of people you know as portrayed<br>here calling out from the sewer<br>tarnish the leader of the opposition's<br>reputation<br>moving on to what i think is the main<br>part of scandal in new zealand which is<br>around<br>political finance it's around the misuse<br>of resources<br>and yeah political corruption of course<br>even more so than scandal i think<br>phenomenon to actually define because it<br>means different things for different<br>people<br>it means different things in different<br>societies and different countries<br>and it's socially constructed by that i<br>there's no real you can't define it by<br>law<br>i don't think it's really just what<br>someone thinks it is so it's what people<br>in this room thinks<br>is corruption is corruption i don't<br>think there's any better definition than<br>that really<br>and i know that's not totally<br>satisfactory but<br>here's a few other ways of<br>to pin down what it means so it's about<br>contravening the laws<br>so breaking laws can be a part of<br>political corruption especially those<br>that are pertaining<br>it's about the acceptance of money so<br>you know bribes etc by politicians or<br>bribes from politicians<br>and spending money on activities vote<br>buying etc that aren't<br>acceptable to again the law or to<br>people's morality<br>and it's the use of state resources i<br>think this is a really important one<br>this last one<br>and it's one that relates a lot more to<br>new zealand than most countries<br>okay we'll come back to that in new<br>zealand<br>we're seen as being fairly corruption<br>free<br>so people laugh<br>and yeah i think there's good reasons<br>why you might laugh<br>transparency transparency international<br>is the<br>major ngo that is combating<br>uh corruption around the world and they<br>try to<br>measure it and get some sense of<br>the relativities of it and how it varies<br>over different countries<br>and so this map here is just sort of<br>usual traffic lights<br>map whereby the red countries all the<br>darker red countries<br>are the ones that are seen to have the<br>highest<br>perceptions of corruption<br>and again yeah just to draw attention to<br>that it's the cpi<br>which is corruption perception index so<br>this is an exercise that<br>transparency carries out globally every<br>year and they go around<br>to each country and they talk to some<br>experts some<br>ngos that have expertise i guess<br>in this area and try to find out how<br>they<br>rate the levels of corruption in that<br>country<br>and as you can see certain parts of the<br>world<br>australasia some parts of north america<br>and north and europe tend to do very<br>well<br>on this map and<br>you can see here on this table<br>whoops i've missed out last year's one<br>but you can see<br>new zealand is always at the top of the<br>table we're always within the top four<br>since this exercise has been done back<br>in the 1990s<br>so right now we're ranked first equal<br>with denmark<br>as being the least corrupt countries on<br>earth<br>um i think there's always some disbelief<br>as we just experienced there with some<br>people<br>um laughing at the fact that there's no<br>corruption in new zealand<br>and i think that's an important debate<br>to have<br>you have to realize of course that not<br>only are these measures about perception<br>of these experts<br>it's also i haven't got the scores here<br>but i think<br>it doesn't say we're entirely free of<br>corruption we're just less corrupt than<br>some of the other countries<br>so i think at the moment new zealand has<br>a score of something like 9.1<br>out of 10 so you know it's not saying<br>there's other ways of measuring<br>corruption and transparency<br>also has this global corruption<br>barometer where instead of asking<br>experts they ask the public they do<br>surveys<br>they use professional polling<br>businesses to ask people so this is the<br>results of last year's corruption<br>barometer and it shows to what extent<br>various institutions in society are<br>affected by corruption<br>and i don't know if you can read that<br>very well there but you'll see that<br>at the top political parties are the<br>institution<br>that are seen as being most affected by<br>corruption in new zealand<br>so on a scale of of one to five<br>political parties are 3.3<br>the media also seen as affected by<br>corruption the private sector<br>parliament but at the other end of the<br>spectrum<br>uh the armed forces hospitals education<br>system judiciary seen as being much less<br>affected<br>so that at least gives us a bit of a<br>counter to this idea that we don't have<br>any corruption<br>people do think there is some corruption<br>in new zealand<br>now this chart here is possibly the most<br>important one<br>because i do share some of this<br>disbelief that<br>new zealanders corruption free based on<br>my observations of politics and based on<br>the fact that<br>i'm seeing all these scandals going on<br>and you know following politics over the<br>last 20 years<br>i can see how much the word corruption<br>or corrupt is bandied around which<br>doesn't mean that there is corruption<br>but the allegations have grown and so<br>this chart here<br>is an experiment i've tried to do<br>whereby<br>doing searches for the word corrupt and<br>corruption as a proportion<br>of all the articles published in new<br>zealand in a single year<br>so you can see here if i can use my<br>pointer<br>you can see here this is in the 1990s<br>the proportion of articles published in<br>the new zealand media<br>about corruption was incredibly low<br>virtually non-existent<br>moving right to the end here of 2013<br>we have a huge amount of articles as a<br>proportion so these aren't raw numbers<br>this is a proportion<br>of the publishings of the media that<br>mention the word corrupt or corruption<br>of course the methodology is not<br>fail-safe there are some problems with<br>it<br>you know for example it could relate to<br>what's in the dominion post talking<br>about corruption in italy<br>or australia etc so it's not necessarily<br>all about domestic<br>allegations of corruption it could<br>involve<br>corruption and sport in qriket for<br>example<br>so it's a slightly blunt mechanism so<br>it's not necessarily<br>all about parliamentary politics by any<br>means but it does at least<br>give you an idea of the increasing<br>salience or the increasing usage of<br>and you can see that it goes up and down<br>a bit but the trend<br>is definitely on the way up and i<br>haven't done it for this year because we<br>haven't finished 2014<br>but i expect that um we're going to see<br>it<br>rocketing even much higher due to some<br>of the scandals that have happened this<br>year<br>okay so on the next slide which maybe is<br>the most important one<br>um which i'm sorry again it's the<br>wording's very small<br>but again i've tried to use the same<br>information but correlate some of the<br>major scandals that we've had<br>in new zealand politics since 1990<br>this is when we had new political<br>parties coming into the political system<br>so in<br>1989 you had the new labour party which<br>then became the alliance about 91<br>you had new zealand first setting up<br>act setting up a web at later and my<br>argument is<br>that that broke down essentially the<br>cartel in the party system<br>you had a lot of collusion between<br>national and labour<br>an unspoken agreement where you wouldn't<br>use that weapon against each other you<br>wouldn't call each other corrupt<br>you wouldn't investigate each other's<br>private lives<br>their fundraising by the other party the<br>way they spend their money<br>political finance was off limits<br>essentially but not for those new<br>parties<br>and the alliance new zealand first act<br>made a big deal of trying to expose<br>some of the things that were going wrong<br>in politics and so<br>you had two new scandals that we hadn't<br>really seen a lot of<br>in new zealand politics in fact before<br>that whoops<br>um you had the wine box around this time<br>winston pete is really going hard<br>on allegations of corruption and tax<br>evasion and tax avoidance<br>then after the 1996 election rodney hyde<br>was a new mp for the act party<br>and you might remember he um<br>he took on the name of the perkbuster<br>and he was exposing the misuse<br>of resources in parliament by his fellow<br>parliamentarians<br>which didn't make him very popular took<br>him morgan<br>even earlier than that straight after<br>the election uh<br>was got into some trouble over<br>the revelations that he had spent nearly<br>100<br>of taxpayers money on some underpants<br>and various other clothes<br>and that was when he was a broadcaster<br>for<br>a state-owned company<br>so um i'm not sure<br>you could call it corruption but lots of<br>other parliamentarians did and they<br>1999 which will come back too soon was<br>when the word sleaze started to<br>be introduced to political debate<br>donna awa terry was jailed for fraud<br>around this time<br>and things had a real peak after 2005.<br>this was the time as we'll come back too<br>soon that we had<br>a big debate over political finance with<br>the involvement of the exclusive<br>brethren in the<br>2005 campaign and helen clark and the<br>labour party's use of<br>pledge card you had the<br>on glenn donating money to both labour<br>and new zealand first<br>and various other scandals as you can<br>see involving<br>allegations of corruption around sky<br>city<br>around pansy wong<br>and even david shearer just towards the<br>end there okay so we're going to go<br>through some of those<br>i'm not going to talk through all of<br>these but let's give you a<br>sort of list of some of the scandals<br>that i'm looking at in this paper that<br>i'm writing<br>and so those are some of those things<br>again to emphasize that just because<br>something is a scandal<br>doesn't mean that it's corruption it<br>doesn't mean<br>that it's proven but it certainly was a<br>controversy at the time<br>and of course they range from<br>what might be seen as completely trivial<br>such as when helen clark<br>signed a painting that someone else had<br>written sorry someone else had painted<br>and it was investigated by the police<br>who found that there was a primary<br>a prima facie case of fraud<br>because the painting wasn't by helen<br>clark but she had signed it for a<br>charity auction<br>and they didn't go any further but they<br>did agree that<br>on the face of it there was fraud<br>there's been<br>in other areas outside of the<br>parliamentary arena there's been an<br>increase<br>in alleged<br>corruption so the peak of this and you<br>know the<br>quite ironic one was when the auditor<br>was jailed for fraud<br>this is the person in the public sector<br>that's supposed to<br>prevent and be the watchdog for fraud<br>happening and the public sector<br>himself was jailed for a couple of years<br>for fraud<br>at this time we had increasing scandals<br>about the misuse of taxpayers money<br>and perks in the public sector about<br>inflated salaries etc<br>and so greg newbold the criminal<br>sociologist said at this time<br>the squandering of millions of dollars<br>by politicians and public servants<br>through expensive trips abroad<br>golden handshakes and opulent<br>conferences is now well known<br>and so the politicians picked up on this<br>and started campaigning on it<br>so we got to the point that the 1999<br>general election<br>labour campaigned very strongly on<br>things not being right in the public<br>sector things not being right<br>in the shipley government of the time<br>and<br>there were some scandals involving the<br>tourism board et cetera and they<br>campaigned<br>now i'm just going to go to a few case<br>examples of what i think have been<br>scandals so of course the 2005<br>exclusive brethren participation in<br>politics<br>when members of that church group<br>wealthy individuals got together<br>and put out some election advertisements<br>mostly<br>pamphlets that they put in houses<br>throughout the country<br>there's not much certainty on how much<br>they spent it's probably about half a<br>million dollars<br>some say a million um these are election<br>advertisements trying to convince people<br>not to vote for labor or vote for the<br>greens<br>and in subtle ways trying to convince<br>voters<br>to give their party vote to the national<br>party<br>the national party denied any<br>involvement and<br>strictly speaking yeah there was nothing<br>to um<br>you know to tie the two groups together<br>of course that was until nikki hagar's<br>hollow men came out and he had much much<br>stronger evidence to show that there had<br>been some collusion<br>involved between national and that<br>church group<br>it's still not clear that there was any<br>illegality involved<br>and in fact i think it's a very strong<br>argument that<br>it actually did a lot of harm for<br>national that national potentially lost<br>the election because of that scandal<br>and you also have to remember that it<br>wasn't entirely unique<br>there had been lots of other ngos<br>trade unions interest groups that had<br>also in the past<br>campaigned um for or against political<br>parties<br>but nonetheless this was quite a big one<br>this was much more money than had been<br>used in the past and it was much more<br>aggressive<br>therefore it created a lot more hate and<br>a lot more resentment from<br>the governing labor party<br>but also at that election you had the<br>pledge card<br>scandal so this<br>this piece of election advertising was<br>put out by<br>the labour party at a few elections<br>three in a row actually 1999 2002 2005<br>and they'd used their parliamentary<br>budgets to pay for that and they<br>regarded it<br>as part of their communications with<br>their<br>constituency and didn't regard it as<br>electioneering<br>because it didn't say vote labour but<br>it did on the back of it give all these<br>essentially policy lists of what<br>that party would do if they got back<br>into power<br>the auditor general during the 2005<br>election it's quite a long complex story<br>but the auditor-general<br>eventually yeah got wind of this and<br>thought well this actually looks like<br>election advertising and<br>he investigated after the election and<br>found that labour had spent nearly half<br>a million dollars on this<br>but that they weren't the only party<br>that<br>just about every party in parliament had<br>been using<br>their parliamentary budgets for<br>all sorts of advertising for leaflets<br>for<br>for everything they did during the<br>looking at those last few weeks of the<br>campaign he found that there had been<br>1.5 million dollars by all the parties<br>spent on electioneering<br>out of the public purse so his report<br>was quite a landmark<br>event for political finance<br>the government responded or parliament<br>responded by<br>taking quite a quite extreme step<br>of making it legal what had been sorry<br>making legal what had been<br>illegal they retrospectively<br>said that that legal spending was now<br>okay and<br>most of the parties also paid it back um<br>as a gesture of good<br>well i guess apart from new zealand<br>first<br>and at the time there was quite a lot of<br>unhappiness about the public from the<br>public about um this money being spent<br>soon after this it became apparent that<br>owen glenn one of new zealand's<br>wealthiest individuals<br>had also given a lot of money to labor<br>at that stage it was the biggest known<br>donation we've had in political history<br>half a half million dollars that's been<br>overshadowed in recent time by donations<br>from<br>kim.com to the internet party and<br>donations from people like colin craig<br>to his own conservative party but at the<br>time it was the biggest known donation<br>in history<br>he had also loaned money to the labour<br>party which<br>and there were rumors that he had given<br>money to<br>winston peters and<br>once the peters strongly denied<br>that he'd taken money from owen glenn<br>even having this press conference where<br>he said i can't make this clearer and he<br>held up a sign saying no i haven't<br>received money.<br>of course it then became apparent that<br>he had received the money<br>later when there was an investigation<br>into it<br>and the only uncertain thing was about<br>whether peters had known<br>about the money he claimed yes we had<br>received it but i didn't know about it<br>and there was disputes about that owen<br>glenn saying that he had<br>that peters did know about it um<br>what was controversial was that at the<br>time peters was also the minister of<br>foreign affairs and trade<br>and owen glenn had been campaigning<br>with peters to get an honorary consul<br>position<br>in um monaco which he never got in the<br>end<br>but peters did promise it to him so<br>again there were a lot of questions<br>about<br>the the relationship between money and<br>politics<br>and i can see the times moving on quite<br>fast so i will try and speed up<br>but another really important one i think<br>from 2008<br>was the so-called hv scandal it wasn't<br>really a total scandal because it never<br>actually worked out<br>and i'll just go over very quickly<br>labour had been promising that they were<br>going to drop a bomb<br>during the election campaign we seem to<br>hear that a lot these days.com is<br>promising one now<br>i think nikki hagar has dropped one with<br>this book which we'll talk about soon<br>and it involved a lot of digging on<br>jonkey's past background<br>and labour put a lot of resources<br>into going back over financial deals<br>that he'd done when he was a money<br>trader<br>in the end labour had nothing<br>and it really backfired i think no<br>incriminating evidence was really found<br>but labour put a lot of effort into<br>trying to show that you couldn't you<br>couldn't trust john key<br>and it was supposed to tie in with their<br>main campaign slogan which was about<br>trust that you couldn't trust the<br>government you couldn't trust john key<br>and these are some related cartoons but<br>i don't think we've got time to<br>read them but again just relating to the<br>fact that<br>there was dirt digging going on that the<br>only way<br>the government felt that they could stay<br>in power was to tarnish<br>the reputation of their opponents and<br>again<br>this is just one example and as we'll<br>come back to i feel the same thing<br>happens now with the current government<br>controversies about the use of mp perks<br>and resources<br>starting of course with the uk mp<br>expenses which was a huge scandal over<br>there<br>it had a contagion factor it was like<br>earthquake that the ripples eventually<br>got to new zealand and people started<br>to start to ask about what resources<br>were being used and appropriate here<br>and lots of mps had their down<br>falls because of it um<br>and the archetypal one was yeah rodney<br>hyde who<br>as i talked about earlier had been a<br>major uh perkbuster campaigning against<br>politicians using um<br>resources inappropriately for their own<br>personal organization<br>he was found to have done the same he<br>hadn't broken any laws he hadn't broken<br>any rules<br>he'd taken his girlfriend on a global<br>trip as a minister<br>but because the hypocrisy factor was<br>seen as so<br>large he um was in a lot of trouble<br>philip field eventually jailed for<br>fraud and bribery<br>again with the mp expenses shane jones<br>was probably the one that will remember<br>for the<br>longest time unfortunately um<br>so why has this been arising why do we<br>have these explosions of scandals that<br>we didn't used to have<br>and this again is coming back to the<br>cracks of my argument is that<br>in the past labour national quite<br>sensibly<br>didn't fire off the<br>nuclear missiles at each other they knew<br>that it was an unwinnable war<br>where they would all suffer if you<br>started making allegations about<br>how the opponents are using taxpayer<br>resources<br>or how they're fundraising they knew<br>that<br>the same nuclear missile was going to<br>come straight back at them for what they<br>are doing<br>and so it suited everyone to not mention<br>these things<br>it was an unspoken rule it was<br>essentially a cartel<br>but of course once the two-party system<br>started breaking down these other<br>the whole collusion<br>yeah could no longer work and so<br>1999 i think was a turning point<br>where labour successfully campaigned<br>against government's<br>lease and came in to get into government<br>themselves on that<br>but then at 2005 with exclusive brethren<br>and<br>the pledge card scandals<br>everything broke down and people didn't<br>hold back<br>so the nuclear button had been pushed<br>and<br>the nuclear detente if you like no<br>longer<br>underpinned political debate and<br>competition and so you ended up having<br>yeah<br>advertisements like this this was in the<br>wellington airport um<br>a national advertisement you know<br>playing on this idea that they were<br>always<br>scandals like watergate that<br>i won't go through all this but i'll<br>just again emphasize<br>the fact that don brash just after 2005<br>he said this government has no<br>legitimacy<br>it's the most corrupt government in new<br>zealand history which is quite an<br>extraordinary statement<br>and it shows the strength of feeling and<br>um<br>fast forward to 2014 with other scandals<br>coming out<br>labor in particular started to hit<br>national over the head about don walu<br>and his donations to national john key<br>quite pointedly in parliament said<br>be careful labour party if you really<br>want to go down this track<br>um you know there will be retaliation<br>and that's exactly what happened and we<br>saw some<br>scandals come out that hurt labor<br>involving that so is this all good for<br>democracy<br>or is it bad i don't think he can really<br>say it's one or the other<br>like i said before all the parties use<br>it i'm not i don't think there's one<br>party that's better than the other<br>um they all want to do so they want to<br>dig dirt on their opponents<br>um and in some ways i think it is a good<br>thing<br>it's good that the parties keep each<br>other's um<br>democratic health in check one of the<br>ways that<br>we can keep new zealand corruption free<br>is by having such pressure on<br>politicians and if they<br>are self-regulated by looking out for<br>corrupt activities misuses of resources<br>etc<br>we have more chance of knowing about it<br>and<br>so in some ways it's a good way of<br>monitoring and suppressing<br>corruption and untoward activity<br>and of course so counter-intuitively the<br>more allegations you have about<br>corruption<br>could mean the less corrupt behavior<br>there actually is so the visibility of<br>corruption<br>isn't equating with the levels of<br>corruption<br>it just might be the case that now<br>there's more allegations<br>and we um what you know little<br>corruption perhaps that exists in new<br>zealand we know about whereas in the<br>past we just didn't know about it<br>and it's certainly the case that<br>some scandals strengthen democracy<br>because we see<br>that the culprits are publicized<br>they're dealt with in one way or another<br>by<br>by public opinion or by the courts<br>and therefore we can see that the system<br>perhaps works john banks um<br>you know leaves parliament because of<br>his donations to kim.com except no<br>to john banks sorry kim.com donations to<br>john beck's and the way that he<br>allegedly<br>um configured those and of course<br>there's the false scandals so<br>sometimes there's controversies where<br>the public actually ends up siding with<br>the politician with the party<br>and they feel that um the<br>allegations have been exaggerated that<br>the media or the<br>politicians are making too much of<br>what's happened<br>i'm going to speed through this quite<br>quickly to say that yeah a big reason<br>why<br>i also think we're seeing more debate<br>about uh corruption and personal<br>behaviour<br>is the fact that we have a much more<br>center-orientated party system than<br>we've ever had before<br>so this is just one measure of where<br>political parties sit<br>on political spectrums and increasingly<br>we're seeing that<br>they're bunching up in the middle and<br>in the past i think it was much easier<br>to tell the differences between<br>some of the parties especially between<br>labour and national increasingly<br>they are borrowing each other's policies<br>increasingly<br>it's harder to differentiate them and<br>they speak less about policies than ever<br>before<br>this is just some of my own research on<br>where the parties<br>are which is in my paper which maybe<br>we'll skip over<br>so in lieu of the great big differences<br>between left and right<br>the great big policy debates that we're<br>used to in new zealand<br>there's more focus by the politicians<br>themselves by the parties<br>on presidentialized campaigning on<br>putting the leaders<br>and their attributes forward as reasons<br>why you should vote for them<br>and so instead of trying to bring down<br>your opponents<br>um on the basis of the what they're<br>putting forward as policies there's a<br>bigger inclination to try<br>and tarnish their integrity their<br>competency<br>and politicians are therefore really<br>vulnerable on those issues because<br>they put forward their brand as being<br>john key or<br>david kanellis or whoever and<br>that's why people vote for those parties<br>because they like those people<br>or not and trust<br>is what we're supposed to see as<br>the the votability of a party<br>so the media<br>itself has also changed and<br>there's been some significant<br>rebalancing of the politician media<br>or the politician journalist<br>relationship and there's no doubt at all<br>that the media today<br>fights and and wrongdoing<br>and exposing what's going on below the<br>surface<br>um so again that could be seen as a good<br>thing<br>more than ever before i think politics<br>is being reported<br>by journalists that want to speak truth<br>to power if you like<br>so whether it's nikki hagar or anyone<br>else they are trying to get below what<br>the official version<br>of things are on the other hand<br>yeah there's a lot more focus also on<br>gaffs<br>on the stumbles by politicians<br>by some of the more minor things that<br>i might just move on a bit but there's a<br>lot more aggression from the media<br>and we're seeing this globally and it's<br>really started in a big way<br>with these guys in this 1970s with<br>watergate and ever since that time<br>journalists and the public saw<br>investigative journalists<br>as heroes people that were<br>calling power to account and suddenly<br>you had a much more<br>yeah culture of contempt in the media<br>where they wanted to bring<br>down governments bring down politicians<br>bring down those an authority<br>there's questions about whether that's<br>gone too far whether there's the right<br>balance or not<br>and whether attack journalism has<br>undermined democracy too much<br>but it's certainly not a case that i<br>think that we can say that<br>again i might just move on to give at<br>least you guys a chance to contribute to<br>the discussion<br>um there's also another option of course<br>that<br>possibly politicians are becoming more<br>corrupt<br>maybe they are more focused on getting<br>resources either for themselves or for<br>the parties<br>maybe they are more venal than um in the<br>past<br>certainly there's an argument that can<br>be made that the type of politicians we<br>have in 2014<br>are quite different in their motivations<br>to politicians that we had<br>many decades ago and that's because<br>korea sorry that's because politics is<br>more of a career for politicians<br>in the past you came into parliament<br>after<br>a career as a farmer a teacher<br>and doing that for many decades and<br>often<br>a parliamentary term or three was seen<br>as public service as a duty now it's<br>much more common<br>for politician<br>politicians to come into politics in<br>their 20s their 30s<br>after time working in that parliamentary<br>institution working as researchers it's<br>been doctors<br>working in student politics or<br>other ngos and it's a political class<br>and you're there because it's your<br>career and you want to be there for many<br>decades<br>and that puts a different motivation<br>on what you're doing in politics and<br>you expect to be well remunerated<br>because you could be off doing<br>pr or something else for in the private<br>sector<br>so there's some arguments around that as<br>well also<br>the parties themselves in this heavily<br>professionalized<br>professionalised era need resources they<br>need money<br>to be able to electioneer more than ever<br>before and<br>increasingly they're actually having<br>trouble um apart from the dot coms and<br>the colin craigs<br>they're having trouble getting that<br>money in terms of donations they<br>certainly don't have members in the way<br>that they used to have<br>to fundraise and give membership<br>subscriptions<br>so more than ever before they're turning<br>to those parliamentary resources<br>as a lucrative way of carrying out their<br>operations<br>so again i think that's why we're having<br>scandals around the misuse of resources<br>and i will actually just quickly jump in<br>with the nikki hagar book in case you<br>haven't already heard about it<br>so because it relates to this<br>it relates to it's the story of how<br>the national government is using<br>mostly bloggers and spin doctors for<br>their electioneering<br>and so i haven't read it it's only just<br>come out<br>not long ago but mostly it's about how<br>some of the communication advisors<br>in john key's office play a very central<br>role<br>in um the blogosphere if you like<br>especially<br>around websites like whale oil run by<br>cameron slater<br>and that it's these taxpayer-funded<br>operatives that are responsible for much<br>of the aggression and politics and so<br>that's why i think we're going to be<br>talking a lot more about this sort of<br>so and just very briefly in a few<br>minutes to talk about<br>some of the other impacts of this<br>explosion of scandals<br>and i haven't yet found reliable enough<br>data looking at new zealanders trust in<br>some of the important institutions of<br>democracy but<br>certainly you can look at this one in<br>the u.s and you can see the effect<br>of what happened in the 1960s with lots<br>of<br>challenges to the institutions of power<br>especially<br>watergate and<br>in general there's a much greater<br>cynicism about<br>those in authority in western nations<br>political parties i showed you this<br>thing before<br>political parties their perceptions are<br>very low<br>and there's all sorts of other evidence<br>of this there was a<br>comprehensive survey done back in 2005.<br>whoops<br>doing this again which showed<br>that three quarters of the public<br>had little or no confidence in political<br>parties and some similar<br>uh results about parliament and mps and<br>so around two-thirds of the public from<br>that same<br>survey had either not very much<br>confidence or none at all in parliament<br>so and there's lots of other research<br>that i'm trying to get into this paper<br>that i'm writing at the moment<br>to suggest that we're a lot more cynical<br>about politics and that i think it<br>correlates again<br>with the rise of these scandals<br>and allegations of corruption likewise<br>in a reverse pattern<br>we can see voter turnout and elections<br>going right down<br>so at the last election of all<br>eligible voters about 68 or 69<br>turned out on election day to vote again<br>another<br>indicator of the the democratic deficit<br>which<br>might correlate with increasing scandals<br>lots of other metrics for measuring the<br>health<br>of democracy political party membership<br>back in the 60s<br>about 24 percent of voters belong to a<br>political party in new zealand<br>now it's down to about two or three<br>percent so it's gone from one in four<br>voters to about one in fifty<br>again another indication that we want to<br>be less associated with politicians<br>just before i finish off i also want to<br>talk about how although i think it's<br>good that<br>we are probing what's going on below the<br>surface<br>and that we're calling out politicians<br>for misuse of resources etc<br>i think there's also a chance that it's<br>having a conservative influence on wider<br>society<br>that in particular this fear of scandal<br>especially for politicians<br>is so great now that they are ultra<br>cautious and it makes the<br>campaigning the whole way they operate<br>being a bit more bland<br>they see themselves as targets for the<br>opponents and<br>are just so careful in all their policy<br>pronouncements all<br>their ways of operating they know<br>that they are being monitored and<br>therefore<br>aren't inclined to say anything that<br>might be too radical<br>or could be<br>interpreted badly and so it's produced<br>it's reinforced what i think is quite<br>blandness in politics<br>and it's given a lot more power to the<br>spin doctors who have control to make<br>sure<br>that the messages of the parties<br>are not problematic<br>but also i think in wider society<br>it's good that we have a greater<br>awareness<br>of corruption and conflicts of interests<br>than ever before<br>but perhaps we have too much awareness<br>of it and we are too worried about<br>um being accused of being biased or<br>being accused of doing things wrong<br>and i was just thinking about this on<br>the way here<br>my wife is um on a board of trustees for<br>a<br>primary school where one of our kids<br>goes and<br>she was trying to get the board of<br>trustees to run<br>election debate for our local electorate<br>in the school hall<br>but the board of trustees was totally<br>against it saying oh there could be<br>allegations of conflicts of interests or<br>the questions we use might be biased<br>because we're asking them about<br>education<br>um and so it was decided no we can't go<br>there<br>again just another example of how we're<br>so scared of conflicts of interest<br>and being seen as biased that sometimes<br>we might be inclined not to do anything<br>at all<br>so some conclusions are that scandals<br>can be illuminating<br>but they can have some negative impacts<br>we could be shifting to this sort of<br>scandal fatigue syndrome<br>where we get sick of these allegations<br>but overall<br>i don't think we can say scandals are<br>good or bad um<br>i guess if i asked you individually<br>about some of the scandals i've talked<br>about whether it's the exclusive<br>brethren one or the<br>use of pledge cards you'll have<br>different views on whether it's a<br>legitimate focus<br>for the public and the media and we can<br>look back at some of the scandals of<br>this year<br>about say uh alleged<br>domwalu donations to labour or the<br>auravita scandal with judith collins<br>and some people will think that those<br>are totally inappropriate scandals<br>and others will think it's good that<br>those<br>things have been brought to the public<br>service<br>i think there's a lot of lessons to be<br>learned from from that<br>and in general i think we need better<br>quality scandals<br>um would be one of my conclusions um and<br>that we it's good to be looking at<br>what's going wrong with those<br>in the elite but we also have to be<br>careful about whether some of these<br>scandals might be distorting<br>our images of democracy and reality<br>um but overall what we need is to<br>i guess be a bit more mature in our<br>approach to scandals<br>and i think this is happening generally<br>the public are getting used to scandals<br>being around<br>and they're becoming a bit uh more<br>critically minded and evaluating them<br>and not<br>instantly just believing anything that<br>the media says about a politician<br>and i think that's the one that's the<br>best track to go down um<br>that we have a more nuanced approach to<br>um allegations that are being thrown<br>around okay i'll leave it there and<br>hopefully you guys can<br>throw in your own um is that right<br>rodney wrote their own point of view or<br>yep i've got a microphone here<br>hello um as you said that<br>we need to have really serious scandal<br>but<br>i think that even bringing like judith<br>collins kind of<br>scandal which are not proven or um<br>these politicians they learn a lesson<br>they next time they will be<br>thinking before those kind of things<br>happen although they are not proven<br>but it does send a signal and a message<br>to those politicians that<br>what public sees now in the this kind of<br>communication<br>age where um information is on the<br>fingertip<br>and and not just um social media is so<br>important and um strong<br>and so i think it does matter the other<br>thing is you<br>never just talked about the williamson<br>maurice williamson's um scandal in this<br>whole thing<br>yeah and my question is again i don't<br>know whether it's related to this one<br>but<br>two international one how the new<br>zealand politics or politicians are<br>um affected by snowden snowden the guy<br>and the other one who is hiding in the<br>embassy<br>yeah those two um so<br>how is new zealand politicians<br>okay um i might just get some more<br>responses first and come back to some of<br>if there is anything else just one down<br>hi i'm sort of doing some research along<br>these sort of lines so i just have a<br>question<br>that's sort of related to how you're<br>going about establishing what actually<br>is a scandal<br>because you said that to be a scandal<br>it's a transgression that offends<br>the majority of the society not<br>necessarily a majority but yeah<br>and then there's also a sort of argument<br>that anything that establishes a<br>sort of obtains a certain level of media<br>attention becomes a scandal so i'm just<br>wondering<br>how you reconcile the two in a sort of<br>environment where<br>scandals are pushed so much by the media<br>how do you determine if something is<br>actually offending the majority or<br>offending enough people to be considered<br>okay well i'll take try and answer some<br>of those points<br>actually i'll start with that last one<br>first um so<br>i think the perhaps if i'm interpreting<br>you right<br>one of the main points that we have to<br>be aware of is<br>does the media equal the public because<br>it's quite possible that what the media<br>is saying<br>isn't very reflective of public opinion<br>at all and in fact<br>or if it is it's the media driving a<br>public opinion<br>um so no i don't think there's any easy<br>answer to that<br>i have to say there are you know opinion<br>polls that<br>uh i think are useful for um<br>getting a public sense of this i<br>certainly don't think it's a majority<br>that you need<br>before a scandal is a scandal and really<br>there is no<br>i don't think there's any sort of<br>threshold that you decide<br>and there's i guess a spectrum of<br>different<br>scandalettes minor scandals major<br>scandals<br>you know game changes and politics etc<br>but i'll think about that a bit more<br>but i guess it does relate to the whole<br>nebulous<br>nature of a lot of this that it's hard<br>to have<br>hard and fast categories and ways of<br>measuring<br>the differences and come to come back to<br>that first one about<br>williamson so morris williamson resigned<br>as a minister on related to<br>his involvement with don walu<br>and his advocacy on his behalf to the<br>police<br>yes i i haven't got around to adding<br>that into<br>the paper that i'm working on but yes<br>just<br>yet one more example of scandals<br>exploding and having a real impact<br>and what i was trying to get at though<br>before was that<br>um that was a really good indicator<br>that scandal politics hurts all<br>politicians<br>because of course then national<br>retaliated<br>in my view at least and released<br>information to the media which was<br>perhaps correct or incorrect which<br>hurt labor about donations and it's an<br>ongoing saga i don't think we've seen<br>i'm just trying to remember what was<br>your other question snowden<br>yes i mean it's fascinating the snowden<br>situation and again<br>it gives a a hint<br>of the democratization especially with<br>digital technologies<br>of information and the fact that uh<br>you know great governments very powerful<br>governments<br>are still vulnerable to flaws in the<br>system<br>that can reveal um<br>massively embarrassing secrets so yeah<br>julian assange as well with wikileaks<br>reassuring that you know<br>powerful governments still have to be<br>kept on their toes<br>but um no it's it's just the start of<br>what's happening and<br>it is a bit scary about where it could<br>go<br>because there's always going to be need<br>for some secrecy governments<br>do need to be able to work in<br>in private as do the rest of citizens<br>so you know there are questions about to<br>what extent<br>surveillance of any of us or of<br>governments or<br>uh political actors becomes too much<br>easily available and um you know there<br>yes i'm really concerned about the<br>amount of time<br>that scandals take up particularly in<br>the media<br>i'm sure we want the concise reporting<br>of them i i don't think that<br>things should be you know hushed up we<br>should know what's going on<br>but once has this feeling of unease that<br>they're almost being used to cover up<br>what else is going on like if you can<br>get a scandal against<br>the other party something else that's<br>happening over here can have the<br>spotlight taken of it and the media<br>seems to be buying into this<br>in the same way that magazines of all<br>types are just centered on<br>people in their lives their imperfect<br>lives<br>rather than anything of real substance<br>and this really concerns me that there's<br>a downgrading of the media<br>that somehow is being exploited<br>by all this i think you've put that<br>brilliantly absolutely<br>and if you look at what's in the news<br>media over the last<br>day or two it's been about in terms of<br>politics at least it's been about<br>videos from the internet mana party and<br>a fence about that it's been about<br>various claims about i'd know all sorts<br>of things<br>nothing actually about policy very<br>little about policy debates even though<br>we're in the midst of an election<br>campaign<br>and um so i share your concern but<br>i i might be inclined to look at it a<br>wee bit around the other way<br>and that scandals are the result of the<br>there's less policy debate and there has<br>been some research to show<br>that scandals tend to get more oxygen<br>tend to be pushed more when there's not<br>much on the<br>news agenda so they come in to<br>replace the missing news<br>but no you're absolute but you're still<br>right that<br>it would be a great democratic tragedy<br>if we<br>end up just discussing wrongdoings<br>and the more trivial sides of<br>politicians rather than discussing<br>different ways to run the world<br>and different you know alternatives and<br>views<br>and that's what election campaign should<br>be really not about<br>focus on the personalities so i i do<br>but i just point again<br>that's why i'm coming to the conclusion<br>that we need better scandals rather than<br>um so scandal per se isn't<br>a good or bad thing some of them are<br>illuminating<br>and are necessary which you know i might<br>be biased but i think this will be a<br>necessary one that helps us better<br>understand<br>power in new zealand but there's other<br>ones that<br>are sideshows that are less relevant<br>and my hope would be that<br>as society as the media<br>we become better at discerning the more<br>quality<br>and appropriate scandals so hopefully<br>that kind of answers<br>your concerns my questions about<br>the fact that it's more about the person<br>and not the issue<br>and the ratio between the personality of<br>the person and the profile<br>and the issue is askew and<br>because really that's the most important<br>thing<br>but it's it seems to me it's a response<br>of our movement to presidential politics<br>coupled with personalities and having<br>had two very strong leaders<br>as prime ministers um perhaps that<br>if jonkey were to lose then we've<br>we wouldn't have such strength and<br>leadership<br>and therefore the balance might shift<br>yeah i think<br>you've answered it yourself and it's the<br>way i view it<br>that the politicians and parties have<br>bought this on themselves<br>they are the ones that have put forward<br>the personalities<br>and campaigned on the basis of the<br>attributes of their leadership<br>and that makes them vulnerable to their<br>opponents<br>whose main methods of electioneering is<br>to try and negate that<br>there's other factors as well and it's<br>cheap<br>your suggestion that the political<br>parties have all moved to the center<br>surely that means there's no policy to<br>debate<br>yeah i mean i i think this is arguable<br>um there's some people that<br>will quite strongly argue you know<br>there's a huge difference between labor<br>and national<br>and that they are wanting to take<br>society in very different directions<br>i just think that politics has become<br>less about the big ideas than it used to<br>be so<br>even in the sort of post-war period in<br>new zealand where<br>um sometimes there weren't big<br>differences between labor and national<br>there were kind of some big anchoring<br>ideas of<br>capitalism and socialism and you had for<br>better or worse the cold war going on<br>which kind of anchored the debate a bit<br>more and that played a really important<br>part<br>i think in keeping the parties a bit<br>further apart<br>and we talked about some bigger issues<br>about creating the good society than we<br>do now<br>believe<br>i've got a question about um<br>investigative journalism<br>and you highlighted the fact that this<br>was you know watergate and<br>some of those juicy events<br>and and i guess i see investigative<br>journalism is as<br>you know trying to find a variety of<br>views and challenging people's views<br>how do you rate the journalists in new<br>zealand today<br>well again i guess i've already shown my<br>biases by saying that you know i think<br>nikki hagar<br>is the premier preeminent investigative<br>journalist<br>i think this will be in the newspapers<br>and tv over the next<br>few days if not weeks but in terms of<br>those people employed by the mainstream<br>media<br>no there's not much going on the<br>dominion post<br>has phil kitchen who i think is a very<br>good investigative journalist here<br>and you know there's some other ones<br>people like david fisher with the herald<br>um and andrew vance has done some work<br>within the parliamentary gallery<br>so there are some really good<br>journalists i think working in new<br>zealand that do<br>and the media you know in some areas do<br>quite well<br>but they don't have much resources and<br>the media is fighting this battle where<br>their business model is falling apart<br>you know newspapers aren't making money<br>most media isn't making money<br>so they do have problems being able to<br>put the resources in<br>to someone to be able to spend six<br>months or a year<br>like they used to on a story so<br>so my feeling is that the media can<br>sometimes<br>do short-term investigations quite well<br>but they don't have the long-term<br>in-depth stuff and that democracy is<br>poorer<br>because of that and i think it becomes<br>important for other people to to rise up<br>and play a part in that debate because i<br>don't think journalists can<br>so yeah people like nikki hagar or<br>academics or<br>people in the community um bloggers<br>because<br>i'm kind of pessimistic away about the<br>way the media is going but i also think<br>that changes in new technology do make<br>it<br>possible that you know it's a bit of a<br>cliche but we can all be part of the<br>media<br>we can all publish<br>our research and ideas online and<br>it's a very democratic<br>potential i think but i'm not sure that<br>that really<br>um one of the areas i'd be interested in<br>your comment on is the<br>is the difference between mistakes and<br>um corruption or scandals<br>and the impact that that has on on the<br>risk adverseness and they're<br>unwilling to take risks and be exciting<br>and innovative<br>i guess once again i think you've<br>answered it already in what you're<br>saying<br>by indicating that<br>the more trivial and<br>non-policy related<br>yeah mistakes that politicians make are<br>too focused on<br>and yes they do make them too risk<br>adverse<br>and so that's my hope that we become<br>less focused on that<br>and less focus on the gaffes i think we<br>all do get drawn into<br>them nonetheless and um it's<br>maybe human nature to um<br>you know respond to the sensationalism<br>of some of those things that happen<br>in politics so i don't think any of us<br>are i'm certainly not immune from it<br>but as we mature i hope that we become<br>better able to discern the more<br>important<br>i wonder if you're underplaying the<br>point about the business structure of<br>the media over the in the change over<br>the past 30 40 years<br>so think about um the massively exciting<br>media environment<br>of um dunedin 30 years ago when i was<br>growing up there and it was kind of one<br>newspaper and one television channel<br>which didn't have to advertise and<br>what's owned by the state<br>and the one kind of and a couple of<br>radio stations<br>but pretty much very very low numbers<br>not many of them have advertised much<br>more state ownership<br>very little competition um i've now got<br>12 different<br>media apps on this phone and they're all<br>competing<br>and they have to compete and what gets<br>attention is pure of stories<br>so i wonder if actually kind of you know<br>when we're looking for who cast the<br>original stone here was that the<br>politicians getting more furious or was<br>it actually a dramatic change<br>in the structure of the media okay<br>there's quite a lot there<br>and certainly on that last point<br>of course it's one of those situations<br>where things have happened in tandem<br>and they've been self-reinforcing so um<br>i'm not inclined to entirely blame the<br>politicians or entirely blame the media<br>and certainly not any specific<br>journalists but um<br>there's you know there has been a<br>tabloidization<br>and um synthetic<br>sensationalism that's been brought into<br>um<br>the media where they're so much more<br>competitive<br>and they know that their jobs depend<br>on getting readership and audience and<br>to do that<br>the horror if it bleeds it leads is you<br>know the<br>cliche for the front page on what we'll<br>actually get there<br>um<br>but i think most people are more<br>inclined to blame the media<br>and i'm a bit more inclined to blame<br>politics and the way that<br>the politicians have have dumbed down<br>their messages and have gone for the<br>more opportunistic<br>i've just got perhaps one final question<br>bryce last week<br>colin campbell hunt spoke about the<br>economics around climate change and<br>things and<br>i think one of the points that was made<br>there was increasingly perhaps how the<br>world<br>was looking at new zealand to lead the<br>way in<br>you know some of the issues confronting<br>the world at this stage so is there a<br>danger that we actually take our eyes<br>off the ball<br>in the big picture of what new zealand<br>well i think<br>yeah with scandals and the focus on<br>wrongdoing inevitably we're going to be<br>focused on less focused on the important<br>things absolutely that's a real danger<br>and um you know there's all sorts of<br>democratic deficits that will flow<br>through<br>and arguably make the government focus<br>sorry make politics work less well which<br>will produce<br>the economy working less well um<br>i don't know that's a big question i'm<br>that's good um bryce on behalf of us all<br>thank you very much i think uh just from<br>a personal point of view i think<br>um looking at some of your slides
