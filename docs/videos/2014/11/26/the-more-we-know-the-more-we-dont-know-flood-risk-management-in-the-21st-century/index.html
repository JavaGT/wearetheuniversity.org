a couple of housekeeping<br>matters uh first of all just your cell<br>phones turned off would be great<br>and you obviously can see the exit signs<br>to your left or your right and<br>apparently the staff know what to do if<br>there's an emergency is that right<br>apparently so<br>so i think that's the housekeeping but<br>it's my real pleasure uh to welcome you<br>here all this evening and uh inaugural<br>professorial lectures are a very<br>important part of the life of a<br>university there a way in which we<br>communicate<br>the leading research that we're doing<br>to the wider community it also gives us<br>a chance for the wider staff to connect<br>with the public<br>and<br>the wider community<br>and to effectively i think communicate<br>the research we're doing to a wider<br>world but also to our colleagues often<br>as university staff with 2000 staff we<br>forget um and don't know what other<br>members of uh our staff are doing so<br>it's a great opportunity for staff the<br>community to come together and to<br>enhance the university's ongoing<br>commitment really to continue education<br>way we ways we connect to the community<br>so it's now my real pleasure<br>to ask robin longhurst pro vice<br>chancellor education also standing in<br>for the dean of arts and social sciences<br>professor ian white specialises in the<br>field of environmental planning<br>his work takes an interdisciplinary<br>perspective that aims to better<br>understand the nature of environmental<br>problems and how they can be addressed<br>ian has been awarded research funds<br>totaling over 2.5 million from a variety<br>of sources<br>including the european union<br>various government departments and<br>national research bodies<br>the private sector<br>and the asia pacific network<br>his most recent project has involved<br>researching the possibility of making<br>houses resilient to flooding<br>from the materials used<br>to the institutional barriers to the<br>views of residents<br>the project involved seven different<br>countries<br>and resulted in new national guidance<br>written in partnership with government<br>industry and citizens<br>prior to joining the university of<br>waikato as professor of environmental<br>planning in<br>2013<br>ian was the director of the centre for<br>urban and regional ecology at the<br>university of manchester in the uk<br>he holds a degree in geography<br>a master's degree in town and country<br>planning and a phd in environmental<br>planning<br>finally there are just a couple of other<br>things that i can tell you about ian<br>and that is that i'm very fortunate to<br>have him as a colleague he has a<br>wonderful sense of humor<br>which you're likely to discover this<br>evening<br>he's also a father to a rather special<br>old dog called toby<br>and he likes the occasional pint that's<br>ian not toby<br>and i hear from my other colleagues that<br>it's good to have ian and his partner<br>lisa on your team at pub quizzes so i'm<br>especially pleased to be able to<br>introduce ian tonight<br>and without further ado what he's going<br>to talk about in his inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>is insights into the difficulties in<br>managing the risk of flooding and the<br>new approaches to keeping water out of<br>buildings<br>so please join with me in welcoming to<br>thank you for coming everybody and um<br>it's so nice just to see people here and<br>know as well my friends my colleagues<br>neighbors<br>and students as well<br>and thank you alistair and robin for<br>introducing me<br>i found this actually quite a difficult<br>lecture to write because<br>it's pretty challenging audience you you<br>you are even though you don't<br>necessarily know that you are you're um<br>you know there's there's members of the<br>public there's colleagues whose work i<br>greatly respect and getting that pitch<br>right so everyone goes home if they've<br>not wasted the time by bypassing<br>watching the block or whatever then it's<br>quite a difficult pitch so um<br>and then if it's not just challenging<br>enough to make you dress like a wizard<br>which is um<br>i am quite getting used to um<br>so i decided to do a self-contained<br>lecture which is essentially about<br>flooding it's the title on the screen<br>and it's going to give you a little bit<br>of history about what i've been doing<br>for the last 15 20 years<br>but it's also a few deeper more abstract<br>messages it's a little bit about science<br>and how science influences science or<br>policy and practice and how certainly we<br>are about things so the more we know the<br>more we don't know<br>it's a bit of a play about what we<br>expect science to provide for society we<br>expect it to find more data more<br>evidence more certainty but it's not<br>necessarily the case sometimes the more<br>you find out about things the more you<br>realize you don't know<br>things which you thought you know were<br>pretty obvious so<br>it's a little bit about how sometimes<br>the deeper explore the more our<br>inadequacies are exposed<br>but first off before<br>we get to that i know it's come<br>tradition at these kind of events to<br>talk a little bit about your journey how<br>you got there and old photos and so on<br>and this is about i've been absolutely<br>cringing about<br>i tried to get out of it but my<br>colleagues wouldn't let me they demanded<br>to see at least one slide of old photos<br>so<br>this is gonna be it we'll get it over<br>we'll both be happier for it<br>and then two minutes then we can start<br>with the the real stuff so<br>by the way this is the only time you're<br>allowed to say oh doesn't he look cute<br>at one of my lectures<br>okay<br>it doesn't have to be interactive you<br>don't have to say it<br>so um<br>that's me when i i started my academic<br>career this is the start of primary<br>school<br>where did i go wrong some might say and<br>then um<br>those two me starting university for the<br>first time with my nana there and that's<br>me graduating with my phd<br>and my phd was on how we manage water<br>it was held here at the university of<br>manchester i think it's photoshopped<br>because it's not raining in this picture<br>somehow the magic of<br>tech is managed to work that out and<br>those two chaps at the bottom were my<br>two early mentors so<br>the guy in the middle is professor joe<br>howe is my supervisor<br>and the guy on the left is professor<br>john hanley and it was him he really got<br>me interested in the topic<br>about how we manage water we'd had major<br>floods about the time and it seemed<br>obvious to me that it wasn't just a<br>matter of holding water back but we<br>could think more generally about where<br>we build and how<br>and that meant that maybe we could have<br>a more planning more geographic<br>perspective about how we use space and<br>how we use space over time to maybe<br>think about how we do things differently<br>and i remember going into<br>john hanley's room and giving him my<br>idea for a phd<br>and he was he was pretty intimidating<br>not because of who he was he's a really<br>nice guy but he'd just been awarded an<br>obe it was quite an important chap and<br>he put me at ease he'd made me a cup of<br>tea<br>and then he<br>fixed me with this look and said okay<br>you've got two minutes<br>tell me why<br>this is a phd<br>and so i took a quick sip of tea and put<br>it down and then i was just about to<br>speak and he stopped said to just sweat<br>that and just went come in and shout at<br>the door come in there was no one there<br>and<br>and then he showed again oh come in<br>and i knew there was no one at the door<br>and i didn't realize it's the sound of<br>my cup hitting the table it assumed<br>there's someone's at the door so i had<br>this dilemma do i tell him do i not tell<br>him do i do it anyway it's quite a long<br>story short<br>that's when i decided that this is the<br>kind of eccentric work environment i<br>could feel myself excelling in<br>so um i was at manchester for around<br>15 years or so until i arrived here<br>around 18 months ago and um<br>yeah thanks everyone for coming and<br>thanks for everyone for making lisa and<br>i feel really welcome<br>okay it's over with now now we can get<br>on to the the main part of the talk<br>so these are the wider points because<br>it's not just about flooding flooding is<br>almost the case of how we understand<br>science and how it influences the wider<br>things so first of all<br>one of the themes going to bear mind as<br>we progress through is just how concepts<br>gain power and how they gain resources<br>and how the command resources over time<br>because the way that we frame and<br>understand concepts as real long-term<br>power not just over the years but over<br>decades as well<br>so that's one of the first things to<br>bear in mind the second is<br>about certainty how certain are we as<br>scientists that we know things and how<br>is this communicated<br>and how might that become changed become<br>through the more lens it goes through<br>there's a quote there that<br>i like to<br>use when discussing about certainty it's<br>by mark twain that's not me at the<br>bottom that's mark twain and um i did a<br>paper<br>which is called the more we know the<br>more we don't know reflections on a<br>decade of fluid risk management and this<br>is essentially forming the basis of the<br>talk today<br>so i found this great quote that i<br>thought would be perfect<br>to start the paper with because it<br>essentially says<br>that it's it's not what you know it's<br>how certain you are about things<br>and so<br>i thought i'd use this paper being a<br>typical academic i had to find out the<br>exact sauce<br>and i just couldn't find it anywhere i<br>even ended up going down to the british<br>library one weekend reading the complete<br>works of mark twain this is what<br>academics do<br>and it took longer to find this and<br>write the paper<br>and it was used by everybody i kept<br>saying it over the internet just<br>attributed to mark twain<br>and everyone was using the pitfalls of<br>assigning too much weight to information<br>and people need to be a bit more careful<br>and it's a long long story short he<br>never actually said it but no one had<br>checked so um i can confirm that he<br>never said that even though everybody<br>still use it i still used it because i<br>thought it was um an amusing example of<br>how people need to be a bit more careful<br>so we've got concepts we've got<br>certainty<br>the next one's about how does this lead<br>to what how we do things differently<br>because the concepts frame things and<br>then the day gives us a bit of weight of<br>information that then leads to okay<br>what's our managerial approach<br>and we've never known as much about<br>flooding as we do right now there's lots<br>of expertise around and yet it seems to<br>be a problem that's gaining<br>worse becoming more severe every year<br>we're getting more more examples and<br>that should lead us whatever cause to<br>think about it's not just what we do but<br>it's how we do it as well<br>and this is partly about how science and<br>society interact how the things that we<br>do can influence<br>the policy makers and also practitioners<br>as well it's also about who's involved<br>in making the science whose knowledge<br>counts<br>because some of the problems that we<br>have can't be solved by any one<br>discipline disciplines are really good<br>at narrow and deep focus but when you<br>get towards<br>some of the broad problems we have in<br>society they had demand different kind<br>of approaches<br>so it's also about the science policy<br>interface or how science<br>as a community as a university<br>well first of all talk about risk just<br>to give you a little bit overview about<br>the different ways that people might<br>perceive it<br>i think the the way it's been used<br>particularly the last century or so is<br>that it's been described as a<br>calculative rationality and what that<br>means is<br>we calculate a value in quite a rational<br>way<br>and some of the ways that that's done<br>the thing on the screen risk equals<br>probability times consequence so we<br>determine the risk by working out what<br>the probability of the event is and what<br>the consequences of that might be and<br>that gives us some kind of notional<br>value<br>and that's<br>good to a certain extent but there's<br>different ways of perceiving risk<br>because it is a concept that different<br>disciplines see things in different ways<br>alternatively beck<br>has done quite a lot of work on how risk<br>is socially constructed and that it's<br>actually incalculable<br>the way that we decide risk just cannot<br>be calculated just because it depends<br>who's doing the calculation<br>different disciplines different<br>backgrounds different ways of knowing<br>might come up with different figures and<br>if you accept that there's no one value<br>then maybe<br>beck's right and then it's it's actually<br>incalculable<br>when goes further<br>and i just says that the approach is<br>quite misleading<br>because it's more than a method it's a<br>misbegone culture which inevitable<br>actively conceals that ignorance and<br>what that means is that it has real<br>power it has authority as weight just by<br>aligning a map or a figure or percentage<br>it has a bit of gravitas and we need to<br>be aware of that<br>the quote i generally use to describe<br>this is this on screen and<br>donald rumsfeld former u.s secretary of<br>defense did this quote which is it's a<br>fantastic<br>it's um it does make sense if you bear<br>with it so just i'll give you a minute<br>as we know there are no nouns there are<br>some things we know we know<br>we also know there are known unknowns<br>that is to say we know there's some<br>things we don't know<br>but they're also unknown unknowns the<br>ones we don't know we don't know<br>this actually won award for being the<br>least opaque utterance of 2002<br>by the plain english campaign but i<br>think he actually has some academic<br>merit<br>um whether he meant it or not it's<br>essentially arguing about knowledge<br>and how knowledge<br>is incomplete and we can only measure<br>what we can see and what we can what we<br>have facts about but it's a lot out<br>there that we can't actively factor in<br>so calculative rationality is pretty<br>good and unknowns<br>it can even deal with some of the known<br>unknowns<br>but the unknown unknowns then those are<br>and then how might that approach the<br>calculative rationality lead to<br>impacts what we do in practice well this<br>is<br>the river thames by london<br>and you can pretty much see<br>by this one picture not necessarily what<br>the approach is but who's involved what<br>disciplines what knowledge is needed for<br>that to happen how a decision is made<br>so number one was about 200 years ago<br>when the first wall was built to hold<br>back the water<br>they decided it wasn't quite high enough<br>they put some more bricks on top of that<br>and then a few more breaks on top of<br>that a few years later until you can<br>start to see the trend<br>is that<br>this is not just an approach but it's<br>also backed up by an entire bodies of<br>learning<br>and it's been incredibly effective<br>at managing water particularly when we<br>can measure we know where the risk is<br>so it's based on ways of knowing about<br>probability statistics and so on and<br>engineering domains and it's been really<br>successful by rivers and the coast in<br>particular<br>and it's also supported by bespoke<br>expertise expert knowledge huge<br>financial advances<br>and so<br>we started to think that given all our<br>knowledge and we have a pretty hard over<br>list of the last 150 years or so we<br>should really be managing this a lot<br>better and yet we seem to get more more<br>events<br>and this is partly because it's the<br>methodology is a<br>it's a static measuring methodology by<br>that i mean they measure something<br>that's perceived to be static and fixed<br>i'll go into it a little bit more later<br>but some of the risks are dynamic<br>now this is um<br>it looks a little bit more complicated<br>than is but i'll talk you through it and<br>it'll make sense in the end is it on the<br>left<br>we have flood events<br>in the uk we had two major ones one in<br>1953 one in 1947 and then we didn't have<br>any for about 50 years<br>and then when i was doing my master's<br>dissertation in 1998 we had another one<br>and that's what i did my dissertation<br>it's one of the reasons why i got<br>interested in the topic it seemed so<br>obvious that the way we build and where<br>with it<br>has a could have a real influence on<br>overall risk<br>and then we had another major one in<br>2000<br>and then for the very first time<br>the measure of how many homes were at<br>risk from flooding and this is what the<br>table is about<br>is that there was 23 million homes<br>in england in 2011<br>and they did annual review well reviews<br>in 2001 2004 and 2009 just how many<br>homes were at risk<br>and they did it looking at different<br>sources so they had rivers in the city<br>so that's like the waikato flooding or<br>flooding at thames<br>and then surface water flooding that's<br>when you get a very intense rainfall<br>event<br>and um<br>the drains can't cope<br>and then groundwater flooding which is a<br>long slow rainfall period where the<br>groundwater just keeps on rising until<br>we can't cope so there's different<br>sources of risk which might demand<br>different managerial intervention<br>2000 was when i started my phd which was<br>on flooding so it just happened to be at<br>a pretty<br>at the right time<br>and then after 2000<br>they decided to look how many houses<br>were at risk and this is the figure very<br>precise 1 724<br>225.<br>i mean when we look at now it's<br>incredibly precise it's not even one<br>house out they they were pretty certain<br>about this they knew to the house<br>what was at risk and what wasn't<br>and then<br>we had two more major floods 2002 and<br>2004 and that gives the chance to think<br>about<br>whether we were right or not<br>and so the data was calculated again<br>and the first figure<br>ended up going up slightly but you'll<br>notice that it gets a little bit more<br>vega and that's what i mean by the more<br>we know the more we don't know is that<br>we think okay we're a bit less certain<br>we know there's a dynamic system out<br>there climate change urbanization<br>but the one to watch is this 80 000<br>figure<br>that was essentially homes who've<br>reported to their local water company<br>that they had drainage issues<br>and then there was 1.7 million extra<br>homes from groundwater which is the<br>first time that had been calculated the<br>other thing to bear in mind is that<br>within<br>three years which is not a long period<br>of time in the the scheme of things is<br>that<br>we weren't out by one percent two<br>percent or<br>you know some kind of<br>regime we were comfortable with we were<br>out by an enormous amount it was twice<br>as much<br>within the space of three years and that<br>should give us a bit of a positive<br>thought about our methodology for<br>determining risk<br>and a managerial approach<br>and then it got a bit worse<br>um<br>another series of flood events in<br>particular 2007 flooded whole areas that<br>weren't at risk from flooding and that's<br>the thing to bear in mind is that how<br>could that happen unless the way that we<br>determine risk<br>might need some attention<br>and so<br>and this is where things really changed<br>so if you think about the important line<br>here is not the first line the 2.4<br>million that's gone up a little bit but<br>you're going from 80 000 to 3.8 million<br>and then think about the previous slide<br>about the wall<br>all the<br>focus for the last hundred of years just<br>can't tackle this risk you can't build<br>walls in urban areas<br>it's about how you plan where you build<br>how you make space for water it demands<br>different professions involved<br>and so again the overall figure we're<br>out by double again so um<br>you know must do better<br>but we<br>it's pretty rare that you get these<br>events to ground truth what you<br>think is correct and so they're pretty<br>valuable in scientific terms to check<br>and we had some more events some of<br>which were flooded in areas which hadn't<br>flooded before again and this is<br>becoming<br>a bit of much of an annual<br>event in um in the uk<br>so<br>we what we can take from this is that we<br>can say with pretty certain authority<br>that 6.8 figure million is probably<br>wrong<br>which isn't what you want scientists to<br>normally say but um<br>it might mean that we need to do things<br>differently we need to think about maybe<br>not putting too many lines on them up<br>so one of the key issues about that we<br>go back to our three themes from the<br>start<br>our concept<br>was interpreted and framed in a certain<br>way<br>it had a real technical emphasis on<br>defense<br>which<br>only works when you really solve your<br>information and where the risk is<br>there's also what's called the principle<br>of stationarity which<br>is um it sounds a bit more complicated<br>than it is it basically means we assume<br>things remain stationary<br>so a one in a hundred year event in 1880<br>would be the same as a one in a hundred<br>year event in 1980 we assume the climate<br>and over a longer time period you can<br>sort of use that to measure what is the<br>you know how bad was this event compared<br>to the past but we know that climate<br>change is changing weather patterns we<br>know that urbanization is changing how<br>water interact with catchments so we<br>know it's a very dynamic system so it's<br>a static methodology with a dynamic<br>system which means that<br>it can't be right we know it can't be<br>one in a hundred<br>it just can't because we don't know what<br>it is or what it's going to be<br>the best way to explain that is the<br>figures that we use from<br>prague<br>prague had a major flood event in 1997<br>it was a one in a thousand year event it<br>was enormous and then they had another<br>major flood event in 2002<br>now some of the questions was how can<br>you have two major fluid events in such<br>quick proximity and there's still be one<br>in a thousand and one in a few hundred<br>and<br>one one of the people answered well<br>technically it is a new millennium you<br>know<br>that you know our data is still robust<br>you haven't caught us out just yet<br>but it also means that we might need to<br>think about just<br>how if we're not that certain of data<br>then maybe we need to think more<br>precaution about where we build how we<br>build and so on<br>the other things about certainty and<br>this is<br>this flies against what we might expect<br>science to provide we expect it to<br>provide more certainty more evidence<br>about<br>you know the more we know the more<br>we find out not the more we know the<br>more we don't know and so there's been<br>this shift from precise to fuzzy data<br>which goes against your instincts about<br>how you expect it to provide<br>and it also means that<br>if you think about our managerial<br>approach<br>how certain are we about our lines on<br>maps our percentage figures of risk we<br>can make<br>pretty good guesses and at sciences<br>we're pretty good at communicating<br>uncertainty but how does that get lost<br>through the chain from policy to<br>practice<br>and then finally we only<br>realized it was wrong because it was<br>ground truth<br>we probably wouldn't have looked at the<br>2001 again too often<br>and it also meant that we had a huge<br>national debate and a huge change of<br>approach<br>and it meant that flooding became the<br>domain of multiple disciplines within a<br>decade when it wasn't historically it<br>just didn't have that remit<br>and it meant that different knowledges<br>counted and different ways of viewing<br>risk started to count and we started to<br>and so one of the things to bear in mind<br>for new zealand is that what would be<br>the case if this happened here how<br>certainly we have the date we have right<br>now<br>and this led to a huge<br>we had lots of<br>the press having a go at planners having<br>to go with scientists having a go at<br>everybody<br>and that led to a real difference in<br>how we do things<br>is that the policy changed within a<br>matter of<br>a few months is that we started to get<br>new policies emerging that we needed to<br>learn to live with rivers and this was a<br>new message because it realized that you<br>couldn't defend against all risk<br>we need to live with a risk<br>make space for water<br>and this wasn't just<br>in the uk this was everywhere in europe<br>this is the dutch room for the river<br>initiative<br>similar to the german equivalent<br>and so if you can't actually<br>keep water where you'd like it to be<br>then you need to make room for it<br>within urban areas we need to design<br>buildings communities to be able to<br>and so the overall approach<br>was flood defense just one siloed<br>approach about building hard defenses<br>very expensive and also has what you<br>call an escalator effect the more you<br>build these walls the more people<br>feel safe behind them and it actually<br>feels more building it creates this<br>cycle of risk<br>where it becomes almost an escalator and<br>so then you have to put<br>more and bigger walls and there was no<br>real avoidance and that led to<br>a change which is called the risk shift<br>from flood defense to flood risk<br>management this is essentially what i've<br>been involved with for the last of 10 15<br>years also<br>and the flood defense was only part of<br>the story and it's spatial planet was<br>also part of the mix insurance sector<br>how do we enable people to recover and<br>cope rather than just the state taking<br>all responsibility so citizens were<br>involved too<br>we had flood risk maps online where<br>people can make choices about where they<br>want to live how much risk they are<br>happy to accept<br>and also brings us to resilience which<br>is<br>where the next part of the lecture is<br>going to go to<br>is if you can't be sure that you can<br>protect against all risks then<br>you either need to avoid it i'll be<br>prepared to cope with what happens and<br>that's<br>where<br>the research proposal i'm going to talk<br>about next blood resilient villains<br>emerged<br>so this is how we used to be<br>resilient<br>this is what's called the isle of<br>chukesbury<br>um it's not officially an island it just<br>got flooded but you can see where the<br>the safe areas are and it's basically<br>the church got there first around a<br>thousand years ago<br>and um you know they got they got their<br>act together pretty early on from a land<br>use perspective they got a high safe<br>area and everyone else started to move<br>around<br>and then<br>more modern ways of dealing with risk<br>is something like this these are<br>floating homes<br>uh i've been inside these are in the<br>netherlands and they're fantastic you<br>know you get a water view<br>it's uh wherever you look out the window<br>whether you want it or not you've got a<br>water view<br>you know they're pretty expensive and<br>they're not for everyone and it's<br>it's also about avoiding risk not just<br>trying to design your way out of a<br>solution which costs a little bit more<br>money<br>it's also about new development but what<br>about the risk that's already there<br>now 99 of the urban form<br>is already there we only get on average<br>only about one percent changes per annum<br>and that means we've only got very few<br>ways to transition towards a different<br>kind of city a different kind of urban<br>form<br>and this is what we do with our existing<br>building stop<br>and it's about as low-tech as you can<br>get we just have sandbags<br>so part of the rationale for<br>the project that i'm going to talk about<br>next is doing things differently let's<br>talk about this did it this is<br>it was called the king canute of<br>somerset<br>he was a builder his house was getting<br>flooded so he decided to<br>stop building whoever's house he was<br>going to build him brings all his<br>diggers back<br>and he built his own flood wall and it<br>worked and it was actually a real<br>successor but now everyone has those<br>resources<br>us you know at their fingertips<br>so<br>we can actually do things differently<br>the average home you can make<br>flood proof up to about this high<br>until the sideways pressure gets a<br>little bit much<br>so<br>do you think about the points of entry<br>to the building fabric and how we can<br>tank and<br>houses and we have different doors<br>different technology<br>to do things differently<br>so all the different points of entry<br>does have a different technical solution<br>that we can retrofit to risks that are<br>already there we can also think about<br>different scales this is<br>a community scale<br>solution where<br>it's actually a pavement where you can<br>program it to flip up<br>so it operates as a pavement or when<br>it's um at times of high water it holds<br>about water<br>so part of our rationale was that we<br>could go beyond sandbags surely over the<br>last hundred years we've learned<br>something where we can do things<br>differently and we can tackle the<br>existing risk better<br>so this is the rationale for the project<br>which i'm now going to talk about it was<br>called smartest smart<br>tech resilience technology systems and<br>tools always have awful names these<br>projects<br>there's about eight million new zealand<br>dollars seven different countries<br>those were the different countries<br>um<br>they all had different kinds of risks so<br>you had the flash flooding<br>in athens you had the long slow river<br>iron flooding in germany which all<br>demanded different kind of solutions you<br>had different warning times<br>you had different kind of hazards<br>and this is what it looked like it was<br>actually quite good fun we had the<br>german partners had a test tank so we<br>could build a house in it and then flood<br>it full of water it was it was it had a<br>serious backdrop but it was really<br>enjoyable today just it brought out the<br>um the big kid in you and so we had<br>these flood resilient doors flood<br>resilient windows and he was measuring<br>how much water went through per hour and<br>the idea was to get onto zero is that we<br>could by testing different technologies<br>we could get something that works and we<br>could then get that accredited and start<br>using that<br>so that's the one of the things in<br>action<br>there's different technologies as well<br>we can have valves which salt water<br>flowing into houses this was<br>let's test something the the test tank<br>in germany again this was an automatic<br>dam<br>which one of the things that looks like<br>a pavement but can be programmed<br>automatically when the water reaches a<br>certain point just to flip up and hold<br>and so<br>testing the technology was<br>was one of the partners and we were also<br>looking at well if it's so good<br>why isn't it used how does stakeholders<br>view it how do the public view it do<br>they actually want these technology<br>wouldn't they prefer to be defended<br>behind walls<br>and so<br>we also looked on a bigger community<br>scale so this wasn't the fabric of the<br>building<br>this was<br>a movable temporary barrier that can be<br>moved wherever the risk is so very cost<br>effective solution<br>and as long as you've got enough warning<br>it works and as long as you've got<br>somewhere to put it that's flat<br>and makes sense it works so<br>it's actually quite attractive for roads<br>where there might not be<br>enough budget to defend against<br>this is a similar one that we tested<br>this is a mobile inflatable barrier<br>and this is going back to some of the<br>things that senator about things like<br>flooding aren't problems that any one<br>discipline can solve they need an<br>interdisciplinary approach to be able to<br>this was used earlier this year in the<br>uk<br>a temporary flood defense measure when<br>you know that the the water is getting<br>high<br>certain river systems you have much more<br>warning than others and then you can<br>put the<br>measures in place<br>so<br>all these measures are really good<br>in certain circumstances they're really<br>good for retrofit and retrofitting<br>it's a silver bullet really for hazard<br>management because we've got no way<br>of influencing that via the planning<br>system the planet system is really<br>constrained it can only look at new<br>development we don't have many<br>mechanisms in society more general to<br>influence what's already there you've<br>got taxation you've got incentives<br>you've got personal behavior but<br>really<br>that's where most of our mistakes have<br>already been made and if you can focus<br>there<br>it's pretty cost effective so it's<br>pretty good for retrofitting to the<br>existing risk to manage surface water<br>flooding which can't be solved by<br>building walls next to rivers or the sea<br>or when we're uncertain when we just<br>don't know what the risk is we could be<br>precautionary<br>this also has pretty much a social<br>justice angle in that<br>small settlements role assignments never<br>seem to get the money the flood defense<br>money<br>is done on a cost-benefit ratio of<br>number of houses protected per million<br>dollar spent<br>and so<br>settlements with only five or ten houses<br>never seem to justify their expenditure<br>it's also really useful for one-off<br>buildings that we need to protect this<br>is critical infrastructure that was<br>flooded<br>in the uk and it was protected by<br>sandbags which failed<br>and as a result of that about 140 000<br>people were without water for about a<br>week<br>and so you can be<br>exposed to the risk of flooding even if<br>you're not flooded yourself because of<br>the infrastructure so we can think more<br>cleverly about what we protect as well<br>the problem is is that<br>although we had a lot of potential<br>um<br>people didn't necessarily want them on<br>their building they<br>you know it was quite good for<br>commercial buildings<br>but really people preferred defenses<br>they didn't want their house to be the<br>last line of defense and you can't blame<br>them for that<br>so the public were uncertain whether the<br>work<br>and<br>whether they should pay for it or<br>whether the state should pay for it were<br>we essentially commodifying a new sector<br>and risk that really the state should be<br>doing<br>decision makers in local authorities<br>regional councils and so on didn't feel<br>that they knew enough to be able to<br>justify spending public money on this<br>how would they know it worked<br>because it's so new we didn't have the<br>long-term data about how it works in<br>each scenario<br>insurers didn't know how to price it<br>if you put this on your home<br>instinctively you think well we should<br>get reduction in premium but it didn't<br>necessarily work out that way<br>because<br>they didn't know how it will perform<br>there's a there's a story which i could<br>never find out was true or not we said<br>we put a flood resilient door in a<br>property someone moved house someone<br>else new moved in and they put a cat<br>flap in the middle and<br>you know it does damage its structural<br>integrity a little bit we didn't test<br>that in the test tank about cap<br>so you're dealing with people and you<br>need to make it as smart<br>as possible so there's less chances for<br>so trust was a key theme from how it's<br>going to perform<br>to how<br>you know how the market's going to work<br>to accreditation to how do you choose<br>the right technology for your house and<br>so we came around to the view that we<br>needed to design a best practice<br>document that would tell people<br>and demystify this entire process<br>and so<br>one of the things we did was quite<br>innovative is that we didn't do it<br>well we thought we led it but it was<br>all these people at the bottom were the<br>key stakeholders in the project so we<br>didn't do what scientists normally do<br>which is we'll design it we'll put out a<br>consultation you tell us things you like<br>or don't like and maybe we'll change it<br>but that's your report and that's our<br>final outcome and it might sit on the<br>shelf and we've all done stuff like that<br>but we decided to actually design it and<br>co-produce the guidance with members of<br>the public<br>with the insurance sector<br>with the people who made these<br>technologies and with the government and<br>that made it a pretty challenging<br>process<br>but we also got enormous buy-in they<br>knew<br>they were happy with it and when it was<br>finished they already had it factored<br>into their processes that they were<br>already recommended it in their policies<br>because it was part of you know they had<br>buy-in too so it worked really well<br>those are the two guidances that we came<br>up with<br>available for free download if anyone is<br>that interested on that website above<br>smartfloodprotection.com<br>um<br>and we decided a six-step process to try<br>and communicate what people do in these<br>situations because it had not really<br>been done before<br>and so from assessing the risk because<br>each risk would demand a different<br>approach to planning your scheme to<br>installing it to make sure that it was<br>designed correct<br>and also<br>so you didn't put cat flop in it because<br>insurers aren't going to give you a<br>discount unless the note is going to be<br>maintained properly<br>so<br>of our hazard changed over time<br>so flooding moved from being a technical<br>domain to social technical and that's<br>not just flooding all the risks are<br>starting to<br>experience that transition too<br>so we think about water quality for<br>example it's not something that<br>and the way the disciplines had captured<br>this<br>really disguised how risk management<br>is the authoritative mass behind which<br>risk taking resigns no matter how you<br>look at it we're taking risks we just<br>have slightly better information we have<br>inside professions just set up to take<br>and because we're not sure about things<br>we may need a resilience approach to do<br>things differently<br>and our science our policy our<br>governance were all mapped on to a<br>certain perception of the problems and<br>it only changed because it was became<br>and that brings us back to some of the<br>messages at the start about<br>interdisciplinary research and also<br>co-producing<br>research with the people that it's meant<br>to influence the people and communities<br>the private sector and governments and<br>so on<br>and i just want to end with this<br>um<br>picture this is<br>um<br>there's a famous quote about standing on<br>the shoulders of giants it's what<br>academics are meant to do<br>is that knowledge builds incrementally<br>and we only<br>you know we're building on lots of hard<br>work by people who came before us who<br>helped us get to where we are now but<br>i want to talk about it not necessarily<br>from an academic perspective but from a<br>personal perspective is that we can't do<br>the work we do without our support<br>systems at home you know the giants<br>whose shoulders we stand upon paul with<br>us go into the british library because<br>we need to find something about mark<br>twain which doesn't make sense in the<br>weekend<br>and so you know the the shoulders of the<br>giants we stand up on our families and<br>now everyone here who are supporting us<br>whatever<br>you know we all know academics and we<br>all have our idiosyncrasies<br>and so<br>thank you everybody for supporting me on<br>this journey and<br>yeah thank you for coming tonight tenner<br>go to katoa<br>thank you very much ian we were joking<br>outside before um<br>about finishing on time um<br>it's quarter past seven no no it's only<br>good<br>yeah<br>um but um ian um i'd<br>say you can have a point but look um i i<br>just want to um thank you for um and<br>very engaging relevant uh inaugural<br>lecture and the way you brought together<br>i think key issues around science<br>technology and society that we still<br>don't know what we don't know but you<br>i think one of the things is the whole<br>area of uncertainty and<br>as a university as we develop more<br>knowledge i think we don't have answers<br>for everything and taking<br>interdisciplinary approach which we're<br>trying to encourage really means we can<br>begin to push boundaries and you've<br>given an example of that tonight<br>and the way in which i think<br>co-production of knowledge and the way<br>we're trying to move as university to<br>may work with end users the way we're<br>trying to<br>learn across disciplines you've really<br>shown ways in which that can be<br>beneficial to society so ian thank you<br>very much and um i really appreciate uh<br>the contributions that you're making to<br>the university and uh staying out for 24<br>hours the other night to put in a centre<br>of research excellence but so<br>thank you very much and the<br>the university of waikato</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
