to<br>just say<br>thank you very much for the opportunity<br>linda to come along here today to you<br>and your staff<br>to the university of waikato<br>to<br>help celebrate this day this important<br>i am really really excited to be here<br>today and share a little bit about who i<br>am and and i hope i don't bore you too<br>much about uh telling you a little bit<br>about who i am that you may not know<br>already<br>a little bit about<br>what drives me and what<br>what are the solutions that i see as<br>important ways forward for our people<br>for our children<br>and uh<br>yeah so in what i'm doing in our little<br>neck of the woods of moody fenugreek<br>so i'm really really<br>privileged to be here today actually<br>inspired again to be maori listening to<br>our students welcome us hearing our reel<br>mihi<br>so thank you for the opportunity<br>so<br>i've i've come away from my clinic in<br>kaitain it's um real privilege i've been<br>at the opportunity to have someone<br>working there but to come away from my<br>clinic and i like it it's just sort of<br>coming out of the trenches and to come<br>into a more strategic position because<br>being here today inspires me as much as<br>i hope to be able to inspire you with<br>some of the things i may have done or<br>may consider to be doing<br>i have a photo here and um<br>if you've seen it before<br>the<br>the the photo here is uh<br>is what drives me actually uh it's it's<br>a photo of my<br>myself and my son<br>so<br>we have seven children so when you have<br>seven children you run out of unique<br>names<br>and he he gets lumbered with uh lance jr<br>so<br>i feel for my i don't know how my<br>grandmother did it with 18 children she<br>still seemed to have very unique names<br>but um<br>so the photo here is of a father and a<br>son embracing a father looking into his<br>son's eyes and holding him up high and<br>knowing that he's going to have<br>the all every<br>opportunity to achieve greatness<br>to contribute to our people and our<br>society our country as a whole<br>he's going to be uh<br>dynamic and energetic and<br>and it's exciting for a father to see<br>and and the converse to there is a son<br>looking into his father's eyes and<br>realizing that he is a father that will<br>provide protection uh role modeling keep<br>him safe and give him advice and<br>direction when it's needed<br>so this is a photo moment this is a<br>kodak moment that i think every parent<br>every father-son mother<br>daughter<br>should should experience in in altair or<br>new zealand<br>it'd be clear it's fair to say that this<br>is not always the case<br>not everyone has the opportunity to have<br>this kodak moment in our country and so<br>i guess things have led<br>me to be where i am in kaitaia<br>and lead me to be passionate about what<br>i'm doing<br>currently in kaitaia<br>i'm really excited to say that every<br>well most days most days<br>i say i'm i'm i'm doing the job i<br>dreamed of doing when i embarked on a<br>career in medicine<br>and that's really rewarding to be able<br>to say<br>i<br>i would like to<br>hopefully not bore you but<br>give you a bit of background as to what<br>led to<br>the person that's standing in front of<br>you today<br>i believe it is in keeping with the<br>theme of the kingitanga in terms of<br>leadership<br>in terms of passion<br>for our people<br>in terms of<br>a solutions focused approach to how we<br>so i'm going to<br>breathe a little bit about where things<br>started for me<br>so<br>it started with<br>a<br>a young pakia<br>mother<br>who ran into this<br>a<br>man in south island who's on a freezing<br>work<br>journey<br>around the country<br>but quite quickly and ended up with it<br>being a<br>a solo mother<br>a solo parking mother raising two<br>or three<br>at that time we were referred to as you<br>aware half-caste children<br>in the eastern suburbs of auckland<br>a solid mother that<br>did her best on a domestic purposes<br>benefit<br>to raise their children to have<br>aspirations hopes and dreams<br>to be<br>a positive contributor to society we<br>witnessed that with our mother who was<br>active in our community<br>so<br>the eastern suburbs of auckland at their<br>time i think you could count on one hand<br>how many<br>maori or dark-skinned people in the<br>community and so<br>it was a bit uh<br>it was a little bit isolated at times<br>culturally so i had a parque mother<br>raising us who didn't have the knowledge<br>of the culture that over time would be<br>seen to be really important part of<br>of who i wanted to be<br>now<br>the challenge of being raised in a<br>community such as that is<br>there's a lot of discrimination<br>the discrimination<br>on basis of class<br>discrimination on the basis of race and<br>discrimination on the basis of<br>uh<br>being from a solo parent family so quite<br>quickly for some reason or for those<br>reasons um<br>you know this this particular person<br>um you know was finding trouble in the<br>teachers uh with the teachers and being<br>in the principles often more often than<br>not<br>um<br>being told his mother being told that<br>the child had a learning disability<br>and uh<br>and not<br>not surprisingly<br>this is a position i often found myself<br>in<br>so sitting in the corner with the dunces<br>head-on<br>you know actually getting um<br>or getting<br>bribed to have good behavior and to be<br>committed to learning and<br>so it was a really interesting point in<br>my life and and i think really<br>interesting because it shapes how i am<br>today in in a few ways because<br>the question was was it the<br>student that<br>was incapable of learning or was it a<br>system<br>it wasn't capable of teaching<br>similarly if i look at my job as a<br>doctor<br>other health statistics we see<br>health outcomes due to<br>a group of people that are incapable of<br>being healthy<br>or a health system that's incapable of<br>reaching their needs<br>i think the parallels here are really<br>really quite true and really quite um<br>they resonate with<br>what my approach to to delivering health<br>care is<br>so<br>quite quickly when you get into<br>the situation where your reputation<br>proceeds<br>into the school<br>you know that's um you're going to next<br>that you're actually not very smart and<br>you're actually a bit of a troublemaker<br>quite quickly this is<br>this is the outcome<br>a disinterested<br>student sitting at the back of the class<br>he's not<br>not reaching the potential so<br>this um this was where i was at<br>and so what happened was<br>quite shortly after this<br>uh it's not obviously not me but<br>i got expelled from my first college so<br>i was expelled from a college in<br>auckland<br>and<br>in my mother<br>realising that she couldn't<br>deliver<br>what i needed at times to be honest<br>getting quite frustrated and<br>you know throwing hands in the air<br>decided she'd send me to an uncle and<br>auntie down in south island tomorrow<br>uh an uncle of uh<br>uh descent and her sister<br>she thought there was an opportunity<br>there for my for myself to be<br>to have the<br>the learnings that i needed which is<br>those cultural<br>those cultural aspects of who i was as a<br>young maori man that were lacking<br>unfortunately i went down the air and<br>that's where i got expelled from my<br>and uh<br>and as you know i reflect on that it was<br>uh it was a challenging time my<br>grandmother my mother's mother<br>took me along to the director it's a<br>presbyterian school in timaru who<br>recently denied that i ever went there<br>because they said no we didn't expel the<br>but i have different recollections of it<br>it was a hall similar to this and i got<br>made to stand up and go to the<br>principal's office in front of about 300<br>or 800 boys<br>but my grandmother went along and the<br>sunday best to get me into the school so<br>it's quite it's quite a thing for me to<br>get expelled from that school after all<br>she'd done<br>so<br>so what happened then was<br>this is a this is a trajectory this is a<br>pathway into<br>um unfortunately into a situation many<br>of our young people face which is this<br>was not a person that was achieving<br>their potential<br>and uh and again if i reflect and i<br>fully reflect on it today the<br>the question had to be asked what was<br>failing was the student failing was a<br>system you know student failing the<br>student<br>so<br>my mother in<br>desperation<br>because<br>we had been asked she had asked the<br>local catholic boarding school in<br>auckland saints great heart if i could<br>go there<br>the the only<br>possibility was if i<br>um did well in tomorrow so that was gone<br>when i came back to auckland they said<br>well sorry the deal's off so um the next<br>thing happened was she applied to two<br>maori boarding schools<br>in auckland so one was uh saint stephens<br>and before i talk about<br>which school i ended up going to for<br>those who may have not picked it up<br>already<br>this is the opportunity for me to<br>actually<br>witness and be a part of<br>a pathway into maori leadership<br>and i think it's important today because<br>we are here to recognize the important<br>contribution of the king sangha to the<br>development of maori leaders<br>i witnessed at the kuru i went to<br>my first engagement with the kingdom<br>tonga was being able to come down to<br>coronation and be involved in<br>the king tongue at that time and since<br>then i've had further opportunities to<br>to reflect on the importance the very<br>very real importance of the king tongue<br>afar<br>so so the career i ended up going to was<br>um hatsu purchase college<br>and um sir toby curtis was the principal<br>of the day<br>and<br>and the other coulda<br>i we never received a letter back from<br>or any response<br>the other coulda um<br>my mother replied to we didn't hear back<br>from so we went along to an interview<br>with um sir toby and my mother and i and<br>um fortunately so toby<br>um<br>may have seen the potential<br>and uh<br>and actually<br>i was<br>privileged to be able to enter into a<br>realm<br>of learning who i was<br>as a young maori<br>and<br>that was<br>that really started my pathway into<br>to maori leadership<br>i was able to witness the<br>the people<br>who would<br>show me and display to me<br>what it meant to be<br>a proud maori man<br>sarah's father sir toby uh sarah's<br>father david<br>sorry leng and um<br>and then realizing that as a young maori<br>person there was a lot more to be proud<br>about there's a lot more in terms of the<br>potential to achieve<br>and provide leadership<br>it was<br>it was the turning point in my life<br>i was going to hartsville preserve<br>college<br>and the turning point was learning<br>those really important aspects of who i<br>was<br>so i remember the first day uh sir toby<br>i was i was going into the boarding s<br>hostel<br>and one of the maurice brothers came up<br>to me and said<br>his name was brother mark he's now<br>father mark and he said to me<br>so where are you from<br>young men and i said oh<br>pakarenga<br>so this is a parkya marist brother<br>said to me oh<br>pakuranga<br>and i never said pekurenga again<br>that seems to shame<br>it actually has come across me one other<br>time<br>in my life<br>and it was<br>as i'd graduated as a maori doctor<br>and i was working at rotorua<br>and a doctor was training me at the time<br>of a doctor from southland<br>she<br>witnessed me going out into my room into<br>the waiting room picking up a patient<br>oh hi my name is lance sullivan come on<br>through<br>and he said to me later i thought you<br>would have said your lunch<br>and it was really important because<br>those uh you know real gentle reminders<br>about<br>remembering who i was or in the first<br>place was learning who i was but also i<br>think coming out of medical school<br>that's a little bit of deconstruction<br>was an opportunity for me to discover<br>what it meant to be a leader<br>or<br>the the aspirations i guess of providing<br>leadership<br>and so today um<br>you know i'm i don't have a wide circle<br>of<br>people are moving because kaitai is a<br>small community<br>but i you know we recognize and see the<br>wonderful new generation of maori<br>leaders that are out there that are<br>doing some amazing things<br>and actually quite a few of those on the<br>slider from waikato university<br>and i might just<br>make a note about waikato university and<br>um when i left tatu purita to college<br>before i went into medical school i<br>actually left a college of 250<br>you know boys boarding school of 250<br>boys and went to the university of<br>auckland which was 20 000 and it was a<br>complete<br>cultural shock and<br>i actually didn't last there<br>very long and it was interesting because<br>i the consideration was to come to<br>waikato where a lot of my friends and<br>peers had come from hartle<br>and in in hindsight it would have been<br>interesting to see you know the<br>experience the different experience i<br>would have had coming to a university<br>which embraces in the whole heart away<br>um<br>and now no doubt the ongoing commitment<br>as a reflection of it<br>uh yeah and so look it's it's really<br>exciting we we as a people we as a<br>nation as a society should be really<br>excited about the the type of leaders<br>that are coming through and like i say<br>this is just a snapshot of those that<br>are um showing leadership<br>i'll talk a little bit more about um<br>hawaii aveco who some of you may know<br>later on<br>so<br>my job i'll talk to you so i'm a doctor<br>by training so i went to auckland<br>medical school under something called<br>the maori and pacific island admission<br>scheme the purpose of which is to<br>increase the number of maori doctors<br>which at<br>any time in the recent near future was<br>something like three percent of the<br>medical practitioner population<br>we have 15 we represent 15 of the new<br>zealand population and probably about 30<br>of the sick population so there's a huge<br>gap between<br>the the number of maori doctors and the<br>number of that were required and that<br>there actually were there and so toby's<br>dora's daughter elena curtis has been<br>doing a lot to increase the number of<br>maori doctors so much so that i think<br>they'd be<br>at any given time in the university of<br>auckland the university of otago<br>somewhere between 150<br>and 200 maori medical students in<br>training<br>which means every year for the next 10<br>20 30 40 years<br>we'll be having 150 to 200 maori doctors<br>graduating so that's<br>that's exciting<br>so my job is<br>is<br>working in the clinic i work<br>and i love the community kai tyler<br>i'll give you a little example of a<br>story about this<br>the clinic i don't know if i've got it<br>yeah the consultation room<br>is anything from the main street of<br>kaitaia<br>to a swimming pool which is a really<br>interesting event there to my room<br>obviously but also to somewhere like and<br>save<br>it's<br>it's a little story forgive me if you've<br>already heard it i don't runway but um<br>so the story goes like this i was in<br>peck and save i was in the cereal all<br>seeking out some nutritious you know low<br>sugar low-fat<br>cereal<br>and it's a patient comes up to me and<br>goes doctor doctor<br>and i said<br>okay so i did my put my clinical hat on<br>and asked him a few more questions and<br>um<br>and then i um two things happened number<br>one<br>i uh referred the man to a urologist<br>and a urologist as a dick doctor<br>and the other thing is i never went down<br>i guess<br>it's a it's a funny side to the fact<br>that my job in the community i live in<br>and that's why i love my job in kaitaia<br>is it's it happens<br>50 of what i do is in the doctor's room<br>another 50 has been in my community<br>knowing my people knowing our people um<br>helping our people when they need it<br>actually um and it might be the rugby<br>sideline of the rugby field it may be at<br>the supermarket it may maybe at the the<br>farmers market whatever it may be maybe<br>in their homes<br>and that's really exciting i'm really<br>really privileged to have a set of<br>skills that allows me to be able to help<br>people<br>in any particular venue<br>so i'll show you a little bit about my<br>final story is um<br>so we have we have seven children who<br>have been through career education um<br>and i guess<br>when i reflect on that photo at the<br>beginning<br>and i was saying this to a person a<br>friend or a colleague of mine this<br>morning<br>uh<br>i'm really assured that these people are<br>gonna these young citizens these young<br>maori are gonna be<br>um bright<br>positive contributors to our people<br>to our nation the exciting thing for me<br>is how can we add a little bit of that<br>brightness to others<br>in our community and in our country so<br>in in particular around the the youth<br>and the young people our children our<br>mokopuna<br>so<br>it's not a parting challenge this is a<br>so i'm a little bit of background<br>towards who i am<br>the next part of the corridor was about<br>well<br>so i had<br>this<br>this bucket load of passion passion that<br>was born out of<br>a realisation of who i was<br>i then acquired some skills at the<br>medical school auckland medical school<br>and then the realization was i knew that<br>there was a problem there was an issue<br>how do we you know what is the issue and<br>how do we address it so the problem for<br>me and this is a slide i use for doctors<br>um practicing northland doctors at<br>national conference the the issue for me<br>is<br>that th this is the this is the problem<br>here in northland<br>and this the sensor start of 2013 in<br>northland 48 of children between the<br>ages of zero and four will be maori so<br>one in two children<br>but by the time you get to over 65 years<br>of age only one and eight<br>will be will be maori<br>so<br>how do we go from being one and two to<br>one and eight<br>well there's a possibility of immigrant<br>immigrating out of the region<br>but having said that there are higher<br>numbers of over 65 year olds in northern<br>than theirs nationally<br>so we're not moving out of the region<br>and going elsewhere in the country<br>because actually there's<br>less chance of you being over 65 as a<br>maori elsewhere in the country or<br>nationally<br>so we could be leaving the country and<br>never coming back we certainly could be<br>leaving the region and never coming back<br>but my greatest concern is that this<br>reflects premature death<br>under the age of 65 internationally is<br>defined as a premature death<br>we lose out on superannuation we lose<br>out on this important transfer of<br>cultural knowledge and cultural<br>integrity<br>and the things for me as a as a doctor<br>is that a lot of<br>diseases affecting our children<br>a lot of diseases affecting our our<br>young adults and obviously our older<br>adults in taco<br>hood<br>are causing this significant reduction<br>in our potential<br>so<br>so much so that i'll challenge a doctor<br>in northland and say<br>on monday so today's thursday and monday<br>you're going to see<br>you're going to see a whole lot of maori<br>children one in two one in two of the<br>children under the age of four will be<br>maori when they come in onto your clinic<br>on monday morning<br>but three out of four of those children<br>that you see that are maori will die<br>prematurely in their lifetime<br>so my question to you is doctors health<br>thunders whatever it may be is how are<br>you going to address that how can you<br>actually<br>stop those three or reduce the three out<br>of four maori children coming in dying<br>prematurely<br>of any number of diseases at any stage<br>in their life<br>rheumatic heart disease<br>bronchectosis<br>meningitis<br>suicide road traffic accidents<br>so<br>we<br>up until a few years ago two years ago<br>actually two and a half years ago i was<br>a salary doctor working in a system<br>which i felt<br>really didn't display<br>the leadership that was required to<br>really turn around our people's<br>health<br>the health of maori and kaitaia so<br>so<br>i ended up finding my own way<br>into<br>into a position where we could<br>um<br>we could set up something that would<br>allow us to say what do we think our<br>people need and how can we deliver it so<br>we being my wife and i so tracy um<br>so<br>the nist of wellness<br>and so we we opened up a clinic where we<br>thought would um<br>serve the needs of our people on the<br>terms that they they needed um the terms<br>that<br>that they<br>required to access healthcare so<br>it wasn't rocket science and it wasn't<br>new but we were we were looking at<br>trying to<br>shift the model of care a little bit so<br>we<br>we said look we won't have any<br>appointments in the morning<br>we just have a walk-in clinic are people<br>when i was working in a clinic before<br>this would have appointments to see a<br>patient but they wouldn't turn up and<br>the reason they wouldn't turn up is<br>because when you ring for an appointment<br>it's on that particular time of the day<br>of the week of the of the month that you<br>need that care not two or three days<br>down the track or even three weeks down<br>the track<br>especially for our people<br>if our people's barriers to health care<br>is that they don't have a phone or if<br>they do have a cell phone they only have<br>50 cents credit on it and they can't<br>afford to spend time waiting on the on<br>the line to the receptionist or the rece<br>the appointment that they get is not<br>suitable for them then all those things<br>are going to be a bridge too far<br>so we said look we'll just open the<br>doors and let our people come in when<br>they when they need the care<br>it was a little bit uh<br>radical because<br>actually doctors don't like to turn up<br>in the morning and see that their day<br>can be anything from zero to<br>two to zero patients to uh 50<br>because that's outside of our comfort<br>zone but i believe and i feel really<br>comfortable that we actually need to get<br>outside of that comfort zone and rethink<br>the way we deliver healthcare especially<br>to communities such as maori<br>so it's been incredibly successful<br>stressful<br>busy<br>but i go home i work harder than i ever<br>have<br>my bills are a lot higher than they've<br>ever been<br>the<br>it's all uncertain<br>every day is uncertain but i feel so<br>much happy about the fact that i'm doing<br>what i went to medical school to do<br>i'm doing what i dreamed i could be<br>possible of<br>achieve what i could be possible<br>possibly achieve when i was dreaming at<br>all today i could be a maori doctor in<br>medical school that i could be providing<br>health leadership<br>so that's that's really exciting<br>it reignited the passion i guess and i<br>guess if i look at it it was a bit of a<br>cycle<br>i went to i was inspired the passion was<br>was burning fiercely<br>i went to medical school and learned a<br>whole lot of western ideas of medicine<br>and western models of care<br>and then<br>the passion sort of got compromised a<br>bit i was<br>you know i was in the system and it was<br>compromised further and it required a<br>bit of a step out to um<br>it could require a bit of courage a<br>little bit of risk taking to actually<br>say this is not what i want to end up<br>being remembered for<br>so<br>we also<br>then looked at okay so we offer<br>models of care where it's a bit<br>different in terms of general practice<br>but we also need to look at how we shift<br>the doctor's care from the clinic into<br>the environments that our people<br>live work and play in the environments<br>that<br>uh they're already there and are safer<br>and more<br>uh<br>familiar to them so we we've got a we've<br>got a school program in kaitai called<br>so it comes out a romantic fever program<br>but we've just<br>tried to<br>branch out on more than just sore<br>throats and dramatic fever which is an<br>important issue but we also see we were<br>also being told hey look the other other<br>issues our children face are<br>skin infections and<br>and coutu<br>so we've looked at responding to the the<br>call of our whanau and also our teachers<br>it's about shifting the model the venue<br>of care<br>so<br>we believe that will increase access for<br>health care<br>so we've got a really good health system<br>in new zealand<br>but it's not accessible to everyone so<br>how do we ship increase access and<br>importantly culturally competent care<br>i think if we measured culturally<br>incompetent care and said you know what<br>number of deaths occur because of<br>culturally incompetent care we'd be<br>shocked and dismayed to realize that<br>a person died because there was a there<br>was a gap between the cultural<br>competency of the health practitioner<br>and the patient<br>we measure clinical competency so we say<br>you as a doctor should be able to sit<br>take a set of symptoms<br>and diagnose<br>and investigate and treat those set of<br>symptoms and if you don't if the gap's<br>too wide we'll say you're a clinically<br>incompetent because harm occurred<br>someone died someone required to be in<br>hospital hospitalization<br>but we don't measure culturally<br>competent<br>issues<br>although there's a start to do that and<br>there's been some really good work<br>around the development of culturally<br>competent clinical guidelines<br>but it's a real challenge because we we<br>don't i don't<br>well many people would agree we don't do<br>so<br>sick kid's a real important issue for us<br>in our community there's no doubt it is<br>here and actually i know it is in<br>waikato i know it is about plenty of<br>plenty south auckland east coast<br>the areas where our people<br>congregate<br>so<br>because these children are trying to<br>learn<br>they're trying to learn while they have<br>illnesses that are<br>particularly<br>and um<br>you know so we are we're if we think if<br>we believe that education and uh satobi<br>uh as a stillwater education would agree<br>if education is the key to lifting our<br>people out of poverty lifting our people<br>out of unemployment<br>giving our people<br>more opportunities to participate in the<br>society<br>if education is truly the key then how<br>can we have children going to school<br>with these<br>these conditions expecting them to not<br>be distracted by pain not be distracted<br>by itch or mummy or<br>to be able to focus on the teacher in<br>the firm<br>so we we're sort of looking at how can<br>we create a venue<br>in the schools for helping our<br>educationalists<br>so<br>i'll talk to you a little bit about<br>uh what what that actually means it's a<br>little this is a slider a little bit<br>around cultural competency<br>uh and what the burden of some of these<br>diseases is seemingly<br>benign and innocuous<br>so this is a young child who's six<br>months of age<br>who had<br>uh this facial rash on the on the left<br>hand side here for about three or four<br>months<br>actually access to care was pretty good<br>for this mother so young maori mother in<br>her twenties<br>access to care was pretty good she'd<br>seen a doctor three or four times<br>the doctor the doctor or a series of<br>what i'd call in a culturally<br>inappropriate treatment<br>they weren't looking at this maori child<br>with the view that there's there's a<br>high risk of<br>some super infection called mrsa and and<br>bugs that are resistant to traditional<br>antibiotic treatment<br>um<br>you know and this this mother would be<br>looked at perhaps going down the street<br>with a child like this and people might<br>frown upon it and say<br>found upon the mother and hey what sort<br>of mother would allow their child to<br>have this<br>uh on their face and they'll see it time<br>and time again and they'll judge that<br>mother their maori mother and say<br>well<br>that's neglect that's you know lack of<br>care and treatment they probably aren't<br>taking their child to the doctor despite<br>the fact that his mother had taken the<br>child three to four times<br>so the child come to kaitaia and and<br>came to see us and um so with my<br>cultural lens on i'm saying well that's<br>probably got<br>an infection which is common among maori<br>populations<br>and and sure enough we do a swell then<br>we give the child treatment on the<br>suspicion that this child has<br>a condition that's very common in maori<br>communities so this is three to four<br>months and this is three to four days<br>after treatment<br>so<br>so this mother was almost in tears<br>bringing the child to us and equally in<br>tears when she brought back the child to<br>say i'm so<br>excited you're able to help our child<br>and the only difference between what we<br>were doing and what the the care is that<br>that child was getting previously was a<br>lack of the cultural lens<br>the cultural competency<br>so we we think what we're doing in our<br>in our clinic but also in our community<br>programs<br>is showing leadership in the in the area<br>of helping maori communities in<br>particular maori vulnerable maori<br>children<br>so<br>so currently we have a clinic and<br>currently we have<br>a<br>service that goes into the schools so in<br>kaitai we have two thousand children<br>that are getting served by we have a<br>staff of 20 staff working for us<br>and the staff<br>half of them in the clinic half of them<br>are in the schools and they go around<br>the schools three times a week fourteen<br>schools two thousand children having<br>health checks<br>so we had people and outside of our two<br>thousand uh community of two thousand<br>children saying<br>okay how can you help us because we see<br>the work that's happening in kaitaia but<br>we live in tahatwa<br>we live in taco<br>and we we live in<br>karikari<br>and we don't have access to the services<br>and we would like something so<br>so that required a little bit of<br>leadership in the area of well let's<br>look at something innovative and let's<br>look at developing something where we<br>can we can't take people into those<br>communities we can't send people 150 120<br>kilometers to<br>harp or three times a week that we can<br>use some technology that we could<br>develop<br>and so we've developed a telemedicine<br>program<br>in the far north<br>and it's reaching remote communities and<br>it's using innovation<br>so the communities i'm talking about you<br>know we're in kaitaia<br>in the communities uh we're looking at<br>serving with this program is up into<br>harper to coal<br>you know all around this sort of<br>particular area up to 120 kilometers<br>away and what we're using<br>or what we're doing is<br>we're thinking so these are children<br>that are going to school<br>so this is what we're seeing<br>in kaito in any given day<br>so the approach is is that child going<br>to be able to learn<br>and concentrate with those<br>with those um wounds all over them and<br>the answer from any clinical person i<br>talk to is no<br>any teacher we talk to us know<br>so we think if we use some technology we<br>can actually capture some of this<br>information<br>in these remote communities and send it<br>back to a doctor or nurse 120 k's away<br>to<br>analyze diagnose treat<br>so what we what we've done with this<br>program<br>um it's been about nine months to<br>prepare it and put it to the ministry<br>is<br>we give people like a digital<br>thermometer and some digital scales and<br>a digital pulse oximeter so everyone<br>would have been to the doctors and had<br>things put in the ears and on their<br>fingers and<br>we won't go any further but you know<br>what i mean<br>so too this digital age is technology<br>there's an opportunity to use technology<br>to<br>span the gap<br>that exists because of geographic<br>barriers maybe span the gap that<br>exists because of socio-economic<br>barriers<br>or even cultural barriers<br>so<br>i'm really excited as a maori doctor to<br>be leading this program in the far north<br>because it is purely<br>the heart of it is actually<br>improved access for my our people<br>and that's really exciting<br>it's just a it's a pilot project it's<br>really new and simple and robust and a<br>little bit cumbersome and it's and it's<br>where it is at the moment where we're<br>really excited about where it can go<br>so<br>so we have this equipment that we give<br>to members of the community that<br>we train on how to use the volunteers<br>from the community<br>the most the most important aspect of<br>this<br>program is is that we're not going in<br>there as doctors and nurses and saying<br>delivering the health care we're<br>actually going in with tools and then<br>we're stepping back<br>so we're empowering communities to look<br>after themselves<br>technology has that potent ability to do<br>that<br>technology allows us to say hey look i<br>train you how to use a smart device<br>because it's all smart device based<br>application based if i give you some<br>clinical tools like these digital<br>tools<br>you can then care for your<br>your own family now why that's important<br>is<br>i would feel a lot more empowered if i<br>was a as a as a parent or as a member of<br>the community knowing that the health<br>care for our people is in our hands<br>more so than just saying it is<br>um<br>and<br>we hope that this program if we assess<br>the people in the community today in<br>terms of their knowledge around health<br>issues and then assist them again in<br>four years time at the end of our pilot<br>project we think they're going to have<br>greater health knowledge<br>and greater health literacy which is<br>going to improve<br>i believe<br>you know down the track further improved<br>health outcomes so the actual program<br>we're doing which is treating children<br>is one part of it they're treating the<br>communities educating the communities<br>and empowering the community is probably<br>the greater part of what we're doing<br>so we're using this so the the staff<br>that are volunteers they use this to<br>take a photo they use this to take the<br>temperature and the pulse rate and if<br>everything checks out and they're okay<br>they're not sick enough that we should<br>be seeing the doctor today and the photo<br>shows you know if there's a photo<br>showing something like this<br>that gets sent to us to a doctor and a<br>nurse in kaitaia and then we arrange for<br>them to get some antibiotics<br>and the antibiotics got a real delivery<br>to the kids in taapa<br>the next day generally but these things<br>here have if we don't treat them they'll<br>be there for weeks if not longer<br>so we think a 12 hour delay is<br>reasonable if it means they're going to<br>get antibiotics sooner this idea that<br>hakihake are just something that will go<br>away over time it's actually wrong<br>because we know that it causes<br>significant illness we know it causes<br>kidney disease there's a link to<br>rheumatic heart disease this causes<br>so<br>the fact that<br>this is<br>the technology available today is going<br>to be vastly different to the technology<br>available tomorrow<br>and what we're doing today is a very<br>simple program we're taking photos of<br>children's skin infections and we're<br>arranging treatment to get to them<br>so it's it's convenient care only terms<br>it's in their school it's a more<br>familiar site than going to the doctors<br>they don't have to pay 100 you know<br>fuel costs for a return trip of 100 200<br>kilometers<br>we as a health system will benefit from<br>this because if we treat these skin<br>infections earlier we're not going to<br>admit them into hospital<br>and the hospital costs at eight to<br>twelve hundred dollars a day<br>you know that's unaffordable for a<br>health system<br>so<br>so going forward this is an exciting<br>type of technology available the<br>i'll talk more about this little this<br>here everyone recognises that as a<br>stethoscope<br>so it's a stethoscope with a hard drive<br>it's a hard drive that has bluetoothable<br>capability<br>you can record 12 30 second sound bites<br>on it<br>so<br>i'm sort of toying with this idea this<br>exciting possibility what if we had a<br>person in<br>taharua<br>who had problems with<br>a chesty cough and we could get have a<br>whanau a dedicated whanau order<br>advocate<br>champion<br>who<br>could actually use something on this and<br>all it is is plug and play<br>six six um sights on the front of the<br>chest recording twelve thirty second<br>sound bites front and back putting it on<br>bluetoothing it to your server which we<br>download and waikato<br>and maybe maybe making a decision on<br>treatment maybe saying hey look this<br>child's okay this child's not okay this<br>child could have this treatment and we<br>can review that child again tomorrow you<br>know this this is just something we're<br>toying with but the idea is<br>we have to look at the horizon on what's<br>on the horizon<br>and<br>if that means<br>greater reduction in an equi<br>inequitable disease then that's um<br>that ticks all the boxes for me as i'm<br>sure it is for you<br>so<br>uh<br>the the final cup quarter i was going to<br>talk about in terms of<br>supporting the theme of the day which is<br>around maori leadership<br>is<br>as we've we've created a charitable<br>foundation in in kaitai<br>so<br>we had incredible support from<br>mainstream new zealand for the fact that<br>vulnerable children not receiving what<br>they need in terms of services<br>vulnerable communities not receiving<br>what they need in terms of<br>access to care was not right and this<br>came from a large section of non-maori<br>new zealand<br>so that was really encouraging<br>we had a lady who sent a check for 30<br>000 because she heard me talking about<br>the fact that people<br>shouldn't not have to get their<br>medication because they can't afford the<br>prescription charges<br>that was really encouraging for me as a<br>maori doctor maori<br>champion for our people of the far north<br>that someone in auckland someone who<br>looks quite different to me and you<br>and comes from quite a different<br>background actually says that's that's<br>not right and this is my sense of<br>support for it<br>so we created this foundation which is<br>really exciting and it's around it has<br>sort of three main focuses health<br>education leadership<br>and the first thing is around this<br>leader uh hari verko leaders scholarship<br>hari was a graduate of waikato<br>university and my dear friend<br>and um<br>and tragically passed away a number of<br>years ago his contribution to maori<br>leadership<br>i believe shouldn't be forgotten and<br>shouldn't be<br>shouldn't die with with him<br>so we i created this scholarship and the<br>idea of the scholarship<br>is that for 12 months we have a scholar<br>that will<br>will sit with me have mentoring sessions<br>attend<br>hui like this and<br>witness leadership in action<br>and we'll put them on through our<br>leadership course it's just we used me<br>and my wife<br>but<br>the idea is you know that second or<br>third slide with all those leaders of<br>today my hope is that in five years time<br>we'll have 50 or 100 harwa virgo<br>leaders scholars scholarship mentors<br>that will say<br>we want to see<br>a pathway to leadership from maori youth<br>that happens by design not by chance<br>i believe someone like myself<br>the pathway to leadership has been<br>through chance<br>and i always wonder what could have<br>happened if i was mentored by someone at<br>age 17 who sat with me every month talk<br>to me about my aspirations<br>so this is our<br>ezekiel<br>from taipei area school in kaitai he's<br>the inaugural 2014 hare virgo scholar<br>he wants to be first maori prime<br>minister<br>so uh he doesn't want to be a doctor<br>and that's not the point he wants to be<br>a leader and he's always saying amazing<br>amazing leadership as a 16 year old<br>and so he um<br>so we we had him down at an event in<br>auckland but the<br>the the thing is he wants to be a judge<br>first<br>before he becomes a<br>prime minister<br>so so our first thing to do is to you<br>know next week hinda and i and greg<br>judge greg davis are going to have lunch<br>i can't support him on a career pathway<br>to law but i could introduce him to a<br>maori judge in northland who can help<br>support his aspirations of going through<br>being a judge and then on to being the<br>the other thing so it's about<br>mentoring and leadership for our youth<br>you know these are young maori who want<br>to be doctors these are young maori that<br>just want to know about dreams so after<br>i won the super sir peter blake emerging<br>leader i went around to the local<br>schools and talked to him about the<br>award about leadership about having<br>dreams so sir peter blake trust has a<br>really clear program on<br>planting dreams the seed of dreams into<br>children's minds it's amazing i went and<br>spoke about dreams installed kids 12<br>months later coming up and telling me<br>about the dream card<br>it's it's really powerful the idea of<br>suggestion the concept of suggesting<br>this<br>so we also we're also looking at the<br>environment people live in<br>so<br>we know that<br>as a doctor we know that giving people a<br>prescription for an asthma attack or an<br>infection of the chest or a skin<br>infection and sending them home to homes<br>like this<br>is<br>money in a hole in the ground<br>more importantly it's a missed<br>opportunity for improved health outcomes<br>so<br>we've been working a little bit with<br>people and some of those people are from<br>hamilton some of those companies are<br>from hamilton<br>and they this is this is tree medicine<br>this is true healthcare<br>this is a home that had five uh a family<br>of five mokapuna and a grandmother<br>living in this house that was leaking<br>the house was the roof was leaking they<br>had the oven open and the oven turned up<br>high to heat the lounge they didn't live<br>in the other two bedrooms because they<br>were damaged by<br>domestic violence they were damaged by<br>because of disrepair<br>and<br>that no amount of prescription<br>medication is going to fix the health of<br>this family it was so we had this um a<br>company from hamilton who said we like<br>what you're saying about<br>improving people's health by improving<br>the environment and so they came up and<br>donated a whole brand new roof<br>for this family that was probably the<br>most successful health outcome i<br>achieved for this<br>for anyone and probably eight or nine<br>years of practicing qatar<br>and this is our son who's um on his<br>pathway to medicine this is a<br>psychology uh student who's with us and<br>this is a medical student and on this<br>particular day i was on call for the<br>hospital and this great reception from<br>i had my scrub green scrubs on taking<br>calls from the ed necessity<br>but<br>powerful<br>powerful view on the health determinants<br>for our whanau<br>from that roof<br>so<br>i<br>i'm just going to finish by<br>by by by saying i hope i hope my talk<br>today has supported the theme of the day<br>in the sense of leadership the sense of<br>the passion that we all bring to this<br>this kaupapa<br>i<br>i really do feel that blessed when every<br>day i'm i'm writing to work and i can<br>ride past the children of kai thai and i<br>know we're making a difference<br>to what they're what their health<br>outcomes and therefore their potential<br>could be<br>really excited about the possibility of<br>reaching out further than the northland<br>region<br>it's about being an advocate and i guess<br>in a quiet way a protester<br>and our protesters by getting out and<br>doing the work<br>challenging my colleagues challenging<br>the health system<br>and i really like this quote from<br>this<br>african-american orator<br>and it really summed up i was at a<br>conference recently and i heard this and<br>i've i'm going to read his book but<br>you know if we can start with our<br>children now<br>it's<br>the prevention of of disease and<br>and unwellness into the futures is far<br>more<br>if um cost-effective<br>then trying to repair broken people and<br>of the cost being the cost to the<br>country in terms of health system the<br>cost to the whanau and the and<br>individual in terms of the<br>the harm<br>the harm of having to sit in hospital<br>for six to eight weeks with a child with<br>rheumatic fever<br>and uh so yeah this that's a fitting way<br>to close my corridor<br>just to say uh thank you once again<br>linda and um and nelson and the staff of<br>uh<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
