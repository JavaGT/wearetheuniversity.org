and gentlemen i'm very proud to<br>welcome you to the 2014 three-minute<br>thesis competition<br>i'm professor k weaver i'm the pro vice<br>chancellor of postgraduate research at<br>the university of waikato<br>for those who have attended the<br>three-minute thesis before welcome back<br>and for those of you who have not<br>attended this event before welcome to<br>what is one of the highlights of the<br>university's annual celebration of our<br>phd students<br>this event is one of the culminating<br>events of postgraduate research month<br>which we hold every year at the<br>university<br>it's a time<br>when we take the opportunity to promote<br>and celebrate our graduate research<br>students their supervisors<br>our students achievements and their<br>contribution to the development of<br>knowledge<br>across the many disciplines that feature<br>in what we do at waikato<br>i hope tonight that you'll be inspired<br>entertained perhaps surprised and really<br>encouraged by what we do here<br>the 3mt competition is part of an<br>international competition that<br>originated out of the university of<br>queensland in australia<br>this is a competition which requires<br>students to communicate to a lay<br>audience in three minutes<br>what they do<br>in their phd research<br>they are allowed to use one powerpoint<br>slide to support their oral presentation<br>this has to be a static slide with no<br>changing animation they'll be judged on<br>three factors which our wonderful emcee<br>will tell you about in a minute<br>the hates for tonight's were around at<br>the uh over a week<br>long period at the end of september with<br>competitors from across the university<br>tonight you will see the heat finalists<br>judged to be the best 10 of those<br>and on that note i would just like to<br>thank very much jeremy bell<br>lorraine friend and ross hallett and<br>also bevin grant who stepped in to cover<br>one of our judges who was taken sick for<br>all the work that they put into the<br>judging of the hate so it was very kind<br>of you and generous of your time thank<br>you i would also like to thank angela<br>skarsbrook and all the very wonderful<br>staff of the postgraduate research<br>office and also communication and<br>external relations who have put this<br>event together and for the enormous work<br>which it does involve because it really<br>does involve a lot of work not only for<br>this event for post-graduate month so<br>it's very kind of them to do this<br>because it really does take them beyond<br>the bounds of what they expect to do<br>sometimes<br>i'd also like to thank our sponsors for<br>the prizes for the competition<br>the winners of tonight's final the<br>winner will go on to compete in the<br>trans tasman final next year in<br>australia we don't yet know where that<br>final will be held because they are<br>holding a final at the moment from last<br>year's finals and the winner of that<br>then decides where the final will be<br>next year<br>without further ado it's my very great<br>pleasure to wish the contestants a very<br>good luck tonight and to introduce our<br>compare for the evening<br>rmc tonight<br>is the very wonderful michelle a court<br>you might recognize her from tvnz tv3<br>sorry seven days or from radio new<br>zealand nationals nine to noon or the<br>panel<br>if you're listening to that or you may<br>be old enough to remember michelle from<br>the children's tv show what now back in<br>the 1980s<br>michelle also writes a weekly column for<br>the christchurch press and freelancers<br>for a number of other magazines in 2010<br>she won the comedian of the decade and<br>has just returned from performing comedy<br>clubs<br>in los angeles and san francisco and she<br>also tells me she comes to hamilton<br>quite a lot i actually also owe<br>michelle uh great gratitude myself last<br>year<br>i<br>had a ski accident and i but i believed<br>before that that i could do the job<br>which michelle is going to do tonight<br>and i<br>knew when i saw michelle do the job she<br>is going to do tonight last year<br>exactly why i did have that ski accident<br>because i was utterly deluded to believe<br>that i could<br>do what michelle is going to do tonight<br>and i ended up sitting over there<br>somewhere in great pain on a lot of<br>drugs and i was high as a kite so i am<br>hugely thank you to michelle for saving<br>me from myself<br>and uh being our wonderful compare of<br>this system three so michelle i'd like<br>to welcome you on tonight thank you very<br>much<br>oh that's lovely that's very nice kay is<br>adorable i'm the one on drugs tonight<br>good<br>that'll work won't it<br>this is fantastic thank you so much for<br>having me back here and as kay said i<br>mentioned to her i'm here all the time<br>i've been here every week for the last<br>couple of months for some reason or<br>another um can i just suggest to you<br>that now that i know that road really<br>well could you whack some more<br>roundabouts in let's<br>seems to me that's what it's really<br>missing just a couple more roundabouts i<br>don't have to go anywhere just so i go<br>around in a circle that would be<br>fantastic so um this is a i really<br>enjoyed doing this event last year and<br>i'm excited about doing it again uh you<br>know all these<br>young people all sort of bright and full<br>of hope and promise which will fade but<br>i do have tremendous admiration for what<br>smart young people do bring to the world<br>though can i just say before we start<br>celebrating them i do want to say that<br>it's not all about youth this university<br>is 50 years old give it a round of<br>i'm slightly older than the university<br>um i don't usually tell people how old i<br>am generally i just tell people i'm 46<br>plus gst so<br>those of you who are into maths will<br>have worked out i'm really old and i i<br>but it's good being old is good can i<br>say that this is to the young people in<br>the room tonight this is um but look<br>forward to it don't rush to it but look<br>forward to it it's all right look<br>i'm your role model oh god um<br>i think it's wonderful i love being<br>middle-aged it actually has made me<br>happier i uh i think that women in<br>particular as we age we get more<br>comfortable with ourselves i don't know<br>what happens to me and i'm not paying<br>attention but<br>but women we do we grow into ourselves<br>don't we we start to feel good about our<br>place in the world and the contribution<br>that we've made to it we even start<br>finally feeling quite relaxed and good<br>about how we look<br>which is ironic because around about the<br>time we start feeling quite good about<br>how we look we actually start looking<br>quite<br>we're too tired to care so<br>really it doesn't matter on the inside i<br>think i'm 18. i think i'm all stilettos<br>and margaritas i do<br>obviously if now that i've told you that<br>i'm 53 you're going go home lady<br>metamucil in camps go on sit down<br>go home and knit oh look there's people<br>up there too hello oh how delightful oh<br>this is great very nice now um what<br>we're doing tonight obviously is that we<br>are celebrating excellence celebrating<br>some really big new ideas and<br>celebrating people's ability<br>really importantly to communicate those<br>ideas now kay also mentioned that i<br>travel regularly i go each year and do<br>gigs in la and las vegas and one of the<br>interesting things i've learned is that<br>kiwis aren't necessarily that good at<br>celebrating<br>ourselves we're a bit laid back it's<br>part of our culture so in america you<br>know they're very thrilled about who<br>they are and they they their own best<br>cheerleaders they think they're amazing<br>it's not based on a lot but you know<br>what i mean<br>they're thrilled with themselves and we<br>could probably take a little leaf out of<br>that book in lots of ways when i was<br>doing the gigs in<br>las vegas i was working with another<br>comic and he said so you're a kiwi right<br>i said yeah that's what we and he said<br>and i said no it's not a it's not a<br>fruit it's a native bird we've named<br>ourselves after a native bird and he<br>said well there's so tell me about the<br>the kiwi bird that must be amazing<br>spectacular that you've named yourselves<br>after what it's amazing what is it what<br>does it do what's it like<br>i said<br>to be honest with you it's quite<br>but<br>we did that on purpose because we could<br>have named ourselves after one of our<br>spectacular native birds right because<br>we do have them we've got i am obsessed<br>with toys i've got a two necklace on<br>i've got them in the garden not the<br>necklaces the birds and um i love the<br>toys they're so beautiful and they these<br>things they've got two voice boxes did<br>everybody know that i they've got one<br>that clacks and one that is melodic so<br>they can have with two voice boxes they<br>can have a whole conversation just with<br>themselves they're like a lady<br>it's<br>quite<br>incredible don't need anybody else uh<br>and we we've got the the quarter crew<br>the white heron flies like an angel<br>looks so beautiful in the sky we've got<br>the kireru the wood pigeon just so tasty<br>but<br>we didn't name ourselves after one of<br>those spectacular native birds because<br>that wouldn't have suited our culture<br>really because we're too laid back so we<br>decided to name ourselves after the kiwi<br>which is of course<br>the one native bird that doesn't fly<br>or sing<br>uh it's sort of dirt brown really if you<br>wanted to<br>describe its plumage uh it only comes<br>out at night<br>if it exists i don't know most of us<br>have never seen one am i right and if<br>you do see one you're not allowed to<br>touch it so<br>we managed to name ourselves after the<br>one<br>native bird<br>that doesn't actually meet<br>the basic requirements<br>of<br>that's genius<br>we've done that with a few other things<br>we had a minister of foreign affairs for<br>a little while but winston peters a<br>foreign minister who doesn't actually<br>good work yes i'm not going to talk<br>about i'm not going to talk about<br>politicians tonight because they all<br>annoy me or not all of them lots of them<br>i'm quite pleased kim.com didn't get<br>elected i mean you know his party didn't<br>can i just say i don't believe he really<br>cares about new zealand and i won't<br>believe he really cares about new<br>zealand until he changes his name to kim<br>so it's really important tonight what<br>i'm saying is it's really important<br>tonight that you don't behave like kiwis<br>don't be nocturnal and quiet and shy i<br>want you to be enthusiastic tuis or<br>kereru whichever you would like to be<br>depending on how much you had for dinner<br>so i want you to be the most warm and<br>exciting and excitable audience ever now<br>it is a competition so let me introduce<br>you to our fabulous judges first of all<br>professor alistair jones who is deputy<br>vice chancellor of the university of<br>waikato alistair is on my right probably<br>your left depending on if you're turning<br>around or not uh it is as deputy vice<br>chancellor it's his job to promote<br>leadership at university and he's a<br>director of a number of companies and<br>also coach he's an apec working group on<br>science and maths education so he<br>probably worked out how old i actually<br>am when i said 46 plus just<br>uh next two no down the other end is<br>paula southgate who is chair of waikato<br>regional council she was a student here<br>she's a ba and also diplomas in teaching<br>and guidance counselling she was the<br>youngest woman ever<br>to be elected to a regional council and<br>that was in 1991<br>and i met her just before i figured that<br>she must have been at that point 12.<br>and in between those two lovely people<br>is moving doug moving dallas who is a<br>university of waikato council member and<br>also a member of the finance committee<br>and therefore possibly my favorite<br>because i think he's the one who signs<br>my check and he's worked for zespri<br>sorry about the crack about kiwi fruit<br>and um<br>and also sky city in the past and he's<br>currently a financial consultant so they<br>are our judges the other really<br>important person that i want to<br>introduce you to<br>is uh arlene baharano where's arlene can<br>i see oh there you are look okay so she<br>is very important she has all the power<br>in the room tonight she's one of the<br>postgraduate studies office team members<br>um this as i said it's about brainy<br>people talking fast and arlene is going<br>to make sure that they don't talk any<br>longer than they're allowed to<br>here's how tonight works i'm going to<br>invite each finalist onto the stage<br>they'll come one at a time and as they<br>start speaking the timer with arlene<br>starts counting down from three minutes<br>and a green light will appear on the<br>table in front of arlene that's all<br>right beside eileen at 30 seconds to go<br>that light turns amber and it's there it<br>is look demonstrating that and it's just<br>like it is if you were driving in a car<br>and don't look right or left just go<br>straight on just just floor it<br>and then at three minutes we get the red<br>light and they the finalists must stop<br>speaking immediately at that point<br>because if they keep talking they will<br>be disqualified<br>wouldn't it be awesome to have those<br>lights at home<br>i'd love it<br>i wouldn't let anybody use it on me<br>and then we'll give the judges just a<br>few minutes to to make some notes about<br>that presentation and then we will begin<br>the next one and once they've all been<br>completed the finalists will be invited<br>back on stage one more time before you<br>are asked to cast your vote in the<br>people's choice because you guys get to<br>chance the chance to vote tonight too<br>inside your program which you all have<br>there is a voting slip presenters are<br>listed
