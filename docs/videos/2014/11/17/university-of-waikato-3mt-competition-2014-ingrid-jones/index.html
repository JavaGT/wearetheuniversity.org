i call it<br>like um I call it mess it's um like I do<br>stand-up comedy in there for a job but<br>my real passion is economics do can I<br>see some of you know that because it's<br>not a secret it's a matter of public<br>record i won the economics price in the<br>sixth form yep I did I know yeah yeah<br>yeah yeah yeah it was a hold of phenyl<br>college and then and maintains her who<br>and and i still love miss so it's find<br>it really confident cuz i do such weird<br>things for a job you know like walking<br>out and trying to guess what you might<br>be entertained by and so sometimes to<br>comfort myself what i like to try this<br>you get a number right just any number<br>don't matter what it is and you add<br>fifteen percent GST to it right so so<br>the first numbers a and i think this is<br>how it works and the second numbers be<br>so you had fifteen percent what you get<br>b and then if you multiply B by 3 and<br>divide it by 23 you get seen and if you<br>subtract C from bead you know what you<br>get ignore you get a oh god you want me<br>to run through that again okay so you<br>get because you've got your number<br>you've got you you've got your number<br>and then you add your fifteen percent to<br>it but then it's a magical thing if you<br>multiply their whole number by 3 / 23<br>but subtract it from the second number<br>you get the food smell breathing that's<br>every time every time you do it why did<br>me a number you choose it's amazing i<br>love it loving economics i'm really good<br>at it it's all I've got judges you<br>better have finished<br>do any more numbers net God move-ins an<br>accountant he'll be going oh my god<br>she's hopeless no it's good i love a<br>spreadsheet alright our next presenter<br>is Ingrid Jones who thesis is<br>reimagining disability towards learning<br>disability Pride and it's about using<br>the concept of pride and Ingrid has<br>worked liberabit of Lee with learning<br>disabled participants to challenge the<br>ideas of disability as a problem and<br>explore moving towards an affirmative<br>view of disability so again you fabulous<br>people do it bang goes hands against<br>if you are lucky enough one day you'll<br>become disabled you heard right I said<br>lucky disability is one of the<br>certainties of life that we will all<br>encounter either through age through<br>life's adventures or through birth in a<br>latest census twenty-four percent of our<br>population that's one in four new<br>zealanders identified as having a<br>disability but how many of these people<br>would consider themselves lucky will you<br>consider yourself lucky we hold this<br>view that disability is not normal it's<br>a problem that we must fix cure overcome<br>and eliminate but why how useful is it<br>to think about something that will<br>happen to every single one of us as a<br>problem rather than embracing it as a<br>part of life your life can be enriched<br>by being disabled you will be presented<br>with challenges a new perspective<br>unamended experiences new relationships<br>and research keeps proving you will be<br>just as happy as everyone else we need<br>to think differently about disability so<br>how do we do this other rights movements<br>have shown us that what first has to be<br>there for a rights movement to take hold<br>as pride people need to let go of the<br>shame and being who they are as a gay<br>black or disabled person and come<br>together to develop a sense of pride<br>because of who they are pride is so<br>crucial but why did it sound so weird<br>when I said you'll be lucky to be<br>disabled why is it that disabled people<br>are only expected to be proud when they<br>overcome their disability become<br>independent and live an ordinary life I<br>contend that a design Lee when disabled<br>people can say to the world you know I'm<br>okay as I am I'm great just as I am that<br>they will have a solid ground to fight<br>this belief that there is something not<br>normal and wrong with them but this<br>change needs to come from disabled<br>people and I think intellectually<br>disabled people are the best place to<br>start I want to foster an intellectually<br>disabled way of researching where<br>participants help drive what we do using<br>participate<br>reaction research this means that I will<br>research collaboratively with not on a<br>group of intellectually disabled people<br>we're through a series of Hawaii we will<br>do three things first we will look at<br>the language used to talk about<br>disability because language<br>fundamentally shapes how we think and<br>talk about the world second we will look<br>at why we think disability as a problem<br>and third we will look at pride and<br>whether it is a useful tool for changing<br>the way we think about disability<br>because it's only when disabled people<br>when all of us stop trying to be normal<br>and load living an ordinary life to walk<br>like a normal person talk like a normal<br>person and instead say Who I am is okay<br>how I am is awesome that we will really<br>have a solid ground to change the way<br>disability is perceived and henceforth<br>demand that the world changes to stop<br>exclusion because if we're all lucky<br>enough to become disabled does that this<br>there was angry Jones what a fantastic<br>thesis and what a lovely presentation<br>it's getting hard now isn't it the<br>University of Waikato where the world is<br>going</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
