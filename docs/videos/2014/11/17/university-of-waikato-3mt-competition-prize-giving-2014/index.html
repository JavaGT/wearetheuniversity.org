tonight we've<br>got a little special something for you<br>and I'm going to ask hey Weaver to come<br>back to the stage and explain please<br>I just want to first of all say um I<br>really do think on this night every year<br>I really do have the best job in the<br>whole university it makes me so<br>incredibly proud to see those PhD<br>students stand up here and do what they<br>did I think we all know that many of the<br>academics we would find it very<br>challenging to do what these students<br>have done tonight and uh also to<br>acknowledge the people who entered this<br>competition in the Heats so thank you<br>very much to everybody and I really just<br>think you're absolutely superb the PhD<br>students at this University it's<br>fantastic now there is something<br>slightly impromptu which we're going to<br>do tonight um there's another very<br>special person in the house tonight who<br>um has been working with us for many<br>oh<br>and<br>and um I just want to say Jan has been<br>working in the postgraduate office for<br>eight years she came to the postgraduate<br>Studies Office to process progress<br>reports I believe and after that she she<br>got involved in everything and then in<br>the last two years she's been specially<br>looking after the faculty of management<br>my WMS and she's a wonderful wonderful<br>woman who has helped things and she is<br>such a huge source of knowledge about<br>everything to do with phds and she we we<br>are losing Jan she's actually leaving<br>tomorrow<br>um so<br>um I on behalf of the whole university<br>Jan you've been an absolutely fantastic<br>person to have here<br>um we've adored you um you've been a<br>she's been absolutely live wearing<br>postgrad Studies Office they're going to<br>miss her terribly we're all going to<br>miss it terribly everybody in the<br>management school who uses General<br>missile awfully as well everybody else<br>so I just wanted to say a great thank<br>you and we're going to give Jan a huge<br>round of applause and thanks for what<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>Jen had no idea and she was at the back<br>and we were trying to keep her in the<br>room and and then trying to keep it<br>somewhere in there we should so she<br>could hear what was going on and when<br>she worked out what was happening she<br>turned to Angela went oh Angela she was<br>so cross but I think it's wonderful can<br>we give her another round of applause<br>she's a lovely lady all right some more<br>lovely people to invite to the stage<br>it's my pleasure to invite our three<br>judges would you please welcome<br>Professor Alistair Jones our Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor of the University of waikato<br>yeah thanks<br>and also Paula Southgate chairperson of<br>and moving Dallas University of waikato<br>and now I'm going to one by one invite<br>each of our contestants back to the<br>stage to receive their check they all<br>received 250 from the judges so would<br>you please join me in welcoming first of<br>foreign<br>and now I'm going to ask our Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor Aleister Jones to give his<br>overall feedback of the presentations<br>thank you Michelle and thank you too to<br>the audience for your fantastic<br>contribution I do or first of all want<br>to thank all those people who entered uh<br>3mt because it is a long journey and<br>it's fantastic in the way in which you<br>can take a a hundred word thesis four<br>years of study and converge into three<br>minutes and and and be able to to say<br>that to a a wide audience is is is<br>fantastic and particularly the 10<br>finalists each year I turn up here and<br>um being a judge gets harder and harder<br>the standard I think is is getting<br>better and better and I think that's a<br>real tribute to the super supervisors<br>but also to the students<br>and also to<br>postgraduate Studies Office and The<br>Wider university community<br>one of the things that really impresses<br>me is how you can take complex ideas uh<br>like solar sunspots and turn them into<br>turning a toxic material into something<br>beautiful<br>taking different perspectives on<br>domestic violence looking at the ways in<br>which our eyes can monitor in the way in<br>which we can uh<br>the way we think about communicating and<br>the way that changes the way our eyes<br>track and I think what what's<br>interesting it for me uh sitting there<br>is the powerfulness of the research<br>that's going on in this University and<br>the contribution that it's making to to<br>the world and and to problems and and<br>when you look across the panel tonight<br>the Stark and starting from indigenous<br>issues to uh not going not just going<br>globally but uh going to The Wider<br>universe so I want to congratulate the<br>whole university on producing uh such<br>so thank you very much you're all<br>waiting really uh you're not interested<br>in hearing from me I know that<br>what you're really interested in is<br>finding out uh who's one who the<br>runner-up is as well as the People's<br>Choice so I'll hand back to Michelle<br>Giants now I'm going to ask for the apps<br>with all the winners and runner-ups<br>names and sides and thank you so much<br>let's die give her a round of applause<br>and I'm going to begin with the People's<br>Choice Award this is one that you chose<br>it's worth 500 and Paula Southgate is<br>going to present the award to our<br>learner now remember this is for the<br>person that you all felt was the<br>clearest the most engaging somebody who<br>really spoke your language and found the<br>right words for an audience which has no<br>special expertise but plenty of general<br>intelligence so<br>just making up just making an assumption<br>about you so Paula is ready to make the<br>presentation and I can tell you that the<br>winner of The People's Choice Award for<br>fantastic it was wonderful I yeah I'm<br>serious you were much funnier than I<br>know anything about anything so it was a<br>fantastic presentation and you know it<br>is one of those Theses that I would<br>actually like to read now<br>um I know I know there are 10 of them in<br>the world and they're all here tonight<br>so<br>so uh now it's time to present the<br>runner-up of 3mt 2014. we have a<br>slightly unusual situation we're doing<br>something a little differently this year<br>in that we are going to present two<br>runners-up tonight so run us up or<br>runner-ups Runners up two runners-up<br>tonight and move Dallas is going to<br>present the award and I have the<br>envelope<br>here<br>yes<br>so the two Runners up are<br>Liam McMahon from The Faculty of<br>and equally as awesome SRI Priya summer<br>shaker<br>and Priya is of course from The Faculty<br>of arts and social sciences so<br>and we will get your certificates framed<br>we only had one frame and we<br>sort of snapped it in half and it didn't<br>look flash so<br>so we'll get you we'll get you one each<br>all right so our winner tonight<br>and this uh they when as well as the<br>check and a certificate they also won a<br>glass trophy which is going to be<br>presented by Professor Jones and the<br>winner<br>of 3mt 2014 is<br>Raymond<br>and that's really quite cool because a<br>bunch of experts academics people who<br>have expertise in the area came up with<br>the same result as you lot<br>give yourselves a round of applause for<br>I think my my theory about that is that<br>you have all just earned yourself the<br>doctorate so um if you would like me to<br>sign your your chit on the way out that<br>would be fantastic and can I just um I<br>would like to just to say one tiny thing<br>I I loved all of the presentations but I<br>would like to personally just remark on<br>Ingrid
