uh I I should say that the<br>People's Choice Award is worth 500 so so<br>it's a substantial amount of money which<br>is great your judging criteria you can<br>do it any way you want you know you can<br>vote for your sister if you like but um<br>but in theory you're judging criteria is<br>uh there are three things comprehension<br>did the presentation help you to<br>understand what the research was about<br>engagement did it make you want to know<br>more and communication was the thesis<br>topic and its significance communicated<br>in a language appropriate to an<br>intelligent but non-specialist audience<br>that's you you're an intelligent but not<br>necessarily specialist audience so if<br>you if you found it that you understood<br>the thesis and it was fascinating and it<br>felt like it was an important subject<br>and it spoke to you in your own language<br>then you give them the best marks you<br>possibly can can I also say one other<br>thing that I didn't mention no<br>photographs during the presentations<br>either I don't think anybody did but<br>please don't we just don't want anything<br>to put them off because it is quite<br>amazing really public speaking is a<br>terrifying thing and these are people<br>who are largely academics and I'm a bit<br>mouthy but I um and I'm used to standing<br>on stage but I've just spent the last<br>well in theory I've supposed to have<br>spent the last six months writing a book<br>uh eight weeks eight weeks the last<br>eight weeks um quite intensely this is<br>um I I told you I came to Hamilton about<br>once a week that's the only time I<br>shower and dress these days so you just<br>live inside your own head I'm just<br>trying to tell you that I think I<br>understand what it might like to be like<br>to be an academic I don't really I've<br>got no idea but you know you're just<br>you're writing you're involved in your<br>own stuff so I think that's another<br>reason why we should be so enthusiastic<br>for each of these speakers because it's<br>not the speaking that's necessarily the<br>natural thing it's the research and the<br>academic work so it's even more<br>impressive<br>have our judges stopped writing you have<br>you you good Alistair is everybody good<br>are you good<br>okay you look good I gotta say you're my<br>favorite so far all right our second<br>presenter tonight our second person is<br>Jack deep uh Singh Lada and she's from<br>The Faculty of law her thesis is a<br>comparative analysis of water allocation<br>law and policy in New Zealand and<br>Australia the research considers whether<br>aspects of water allocation in Australia<br>might be suitable to improve water<br>allocation law and policy in New Zealand<br>so you did it really well before let's<br>do it again a massively enthusiastic<br>Australia or New Zealand<br>winning and water allocation<br>this is an intriguing question<br>on the one hand we have one of the<br>world's driest continents Australia and<br>on the other we have a country our own<br>New Zealand which has ranked fairly<br>highly for water availability on a<br>global level<br>and why is water allocation important<br>anyway<br>well the United Nations has stated that<br>because of water scarcity<br>the one which we allocate water should<br>be both efficient and equitable<br>so there needs to be an element of<br>fairness about our water allocation<br>this brings me to the point of our<br>perception in New Zealand are we really<br>that abundant in terms of water<br>of all the world's water only one<br>percent is available for fresh water<br>allocation<br>and our high ranking by the oucd is<br>actually based on per capita<br>availability but are we drinking all<br>this water I don't think so I know I'm<br>not<br>that water is actually being used to<br>manufacture products and in particular<br>products such as milk powder which is<br>then exported overseas<br>so we have this concept of virtual water<br>and if we think about water availability<br>in terms of virtual water as well we can<br>see why allocation is such an issue<br>New Zealand and Australia both began<br>with riparian rights which were<br>basically rights that a landowner has to<br>water which runs past the land that they<br>own<br>gradually this was supplanted with<br>statutory rights so in New Zealand in<br>1967 we had the water and soil<br>conservation Act passed<br>this Act created a national body the<br>National Water and Soil Conservation<br>Authority<br>and also it required that water boards<br>must allocate water so that the best use<br>Following on<br>when this act was applied by the courts<br>they said looking at the act as a whole<br>it actually shows that we need a<br>balancing test<br>this act was replaced by the resource<br>management act which removed the<br>National Water and Soil Conservation<br>Authority and created a hierarchy of<br>planning instruments<br>so the hierarchy was at a national and a<br>local government level<br>the problem was that it took 20 years<br>for a national document to be created<br>and in some areas Regional documents or<br>planning instruments weren't created<br>either<br>in the meantime across the Dutch and<br>Australia there has been rapid reform<br>particularly in the year 2000 and<br>onwards around water markets allocating<br>according to separating the take and use<br>of water allowing transferability<br>between different water users and even<br>something which you might not have heard<br>before which has water accounting<br>how novel is that<br>so it seems that Australia is far ahead<br>of New Zealand and water allocation and<br>reallocation<br>that was Jag deep singlada and I noticed<br>she did that with six minutes to spare<br>Arlene is that about right<br>excellent that's good that's very tight<br>and lovely I like that six<br>six oh no the University of waikato</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
