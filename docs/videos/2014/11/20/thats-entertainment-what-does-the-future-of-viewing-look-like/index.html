Now people get information anywhere, anytime, and in any format. This, combined with the rise of celebrity culture, has completely changed the entertainment landscape.

New Zealand knows<br>you've got no place to be 7pm weeknights<br>anymore<br>I'll see you on the 20th and so<br>and so here I am and I'm delighted to be<br>here I'll probably be back here tomorrow<br>night<br>I am very attached to the University of<br>waikato very attached my stand-up comedy<br>career started about 100 meters that way<br>in the old WSU Hall I was a law student<br>at the time and um and I saw a little<br>sign up that said first timers stand-up<br>comedy competition and it made of me<br>made of mine sort of convinced me to get<br>up and give it a go and and I won and<br>the prize for winning was that I got to<br>represent the University at the national<br>universities comedy competition which<br>was a couple of weeks later which is<br>pretty nerve-wracking I showed up and uh<br>up against me was a team from Victoria<br>university called Flight of the Concords<br>yeah and it was a tie<br>between Canterbury and Victoria that<br>year<br>waikato came in eighth but nonetheless<br>that competition has been a very big<br>springboard uh Flight of the Concords as<br>you know I mean they went to Edinburgh<br>they won the number one award in comedy<br>the Perrier award then they went to the<br>states they got two series on HBO one<br>Emmy Award one of them on a Grammy the<br>other one won an Oscar<br>and me<br>well I'm spending my Wednesday night<br>back at the University hostingly went to<br>lecture Series so<br>it's nice to be here I am in all<br>seriousness um stand up comedy has been<br>a bit of a Gateway into just about<br>everything I've done since then it's<br>been you know 20 years since I first did<br>that gig near 19 years<br>um my best gig and my worst gig were<br>both here in Hamilton in those early<br>years<br>this one was at<br>um the place called the Outback Inn I<br>think it's still around<br>it was during orientation week and I<br>decided to have a bit of a talent<br>showcase they had a thousand students in<br>the Showcase was running a bit late so<br>the Dance Floor had already started and<br>at 11 o'clock at night they turned the<br>music off and they said okay stop<br>dancing everyone there's a guy called<br>Jesse wants to do some comedy<br>and they actually booed me on my way out<br>on the stage and I managed to turn them<br>around and had a really good gig so I<br>still remember that as one of the<br>toughest uh you know one of the one of<br>the most rewarding gigs I've done<br>um I didn't stay triumphant for long<br>about three days later they had the<br>pajama party at the Outback in which I<br>was the host of and someone lent over as<br>I was emceeing and pulled my pants down<br>my pajama pants it's like a full down<br>trowel and I had a script in one hand<br>and a microphone with the other so I<br>took some time to get the pajama pants<br>back up again was really mortifyingly<br>embarrassing because I was a student at<br>the time you know I was thinking people<br>around University are gonna you know<br>I've seen everything and<br>embarrassment I'd like to say disappears<br>with time but it was about three weeks<br>ago I was at a black tie event in<br>Auckland and a woman came up to me<br>looking quite glamorous and she said um<br>Jesse Mulligan and I just want to let<br>you know that I was at the Outback end<br>that night<br>that someone pulled your pants down<br>there are a lot of us out there and we<br>so yeah so stand up uh opened up a lot<br>of opportunities for me from you know my<br>first job at a local radio station here<br>in Hamilton right through to<br>um seven sharp which I uh started last<br>year you know tonight's lecture is what<br>does the future of viewing look like and<br>you know to be honest it was meant to<br>look like seven sharp seven sharp was<br>invented they got rid of close-up and<br>they decided you know if we're if we<br>want to stop hemorrhaging viewers we're<br>gonna have to create this new amazing<br>half hour hybrid of news and<br>entertainment that'll come on at seven<br>o'clock and we'll get the young people<br>excited and um and you know that first<br>week you I mean that show that what we<br>were we were trying to make that show<br>you know and it and it didn't work for<br>whatever reason and um the shows sort of<br>solidified a wee but um during the year<br>and then this year sort of the audience<br>is really stabilized and I've got great<br>presenters but they've really sort of<br>tried to decrease some of that risks<br>though they're really almost making the<br>same sort of show as close up you know<br>under a new look and that's going for<br>them but you know it's not quite the<br>same sort of answer to the question that<br>they were asking back in the start of<br>2013 you know when we all came on board<br>um so if future viewing doesn't look<br>like seven sharp what does it look like<br>well don't ask me I'm unemployed but<br>luckily we have three amazing speakers<br>tonight to talk to you about it<br>associate professor Jeff Leland he's<br>senior lecturer in the screen and media<br>Department here at University of waikato<br>next to him author Julie Thomas and<br>finally from the wireless she's a senior<br>producer there Megan Whelan and then<br>we'll do a bit of a q a after that so if<br>anyone's got any questions uh hold on to<br>them and we'll sort of run a little bit<br>of a question and answer session uh<br>towards the end of the lecture so let me<br>tell you about some of these people<br>associate professor Jeff

silence<br>so please give all these speakers a lot<br>of love as they come up and speak to you<br>and put your hands together and help<br>warm up this room in a cold Winter's<br>Night please welcome first of all<br>uh Kiera good evening<br>um<br>the future entertainment in 15 minutes I<br>it's going to be a very short talk I<br>could probably talk do a short talk<br>about the future of the National Party<br>in five minutes<br>um<br>but I'm going to address some of the<br>issues here tonight<br>thank you so it's a message of Hope and<br>despair and that's pretty much my state<br>of mind these days particularly when I'm<br>a marking student assignments<br>um<br>but I do see a lot of Hope and I do see<br>things that continue to worry me in the<br>entertainment industry<br>thank you<br>so um this is probably this probably<br>encapsulates in many ways my attitude to<br>the current entertainment industry<br>industry that is still largely dominated<br>by American cultural products AKA<br>Hollywood<br>um and<br>um I'm particularly interested in and<br>also often worried by the continued<br>domination particularly the domination<br>of New Zealand by cultural products from<br>America<br>so I've been thinking about this for a<br>long time this is my first book I ever<br>wrote<br>um<br>and it's interesting that one of those<br>images still possess the Madonna the<br>other one you might recognize but I have<br>always kind of engaged with these kind<br>um so hating and loving Hollywood this<br>is the hating bit<br>this is Michael bloody Bay you all know<br>who Michael Bay is the um the person<br>responsible for the Transformers films<br>and other atrocities<br>to me he exemplifies all which is wrong<br>next slide thanks<br>um and I'm not the only one that thinks<br>like this this is uh from one of the New<br>Zealand's best screenwriters James<br>Griffin<br>um he also holds them to count or argue<br>the ought to be held to account for what<br>he does<br>so that's a hating but the loving bit is<br>um these kind of films both mainstream<br>films Art House films<br>um and I'm I'm not you know some might<br>think I'm a bit snobby but when I<br>encounter a mainstream film that comes<br>out of Hollywood as we know it<br>um and Delight in it it's kind of<br>reinsuring for me The Lego Movie I<br>thought how the hell could you make a<br>film out of bits of plastic I went to<br>Lego Movie and it's a really really<br>enthralling film a funny film a film I<br>really loved<br>and there is also in addition to film<br>and talking primarily about film but as<br>Hollywood continues to milk the<br>formulaic the cliched the Disposable<br>prequel sequels remakes franchises<br>television as television I think is<br>taking the place of the kind of stories<br>that I want to see I read the other day<br>um a story that really made my heart<br>sink that over the next four years<br>American Studios uh have proposing that<br>they'll be releasing 22 superhero<br>feature films 22.<br>that's more than five a year I'm already<br>super hero encountered superhero fatigue<br>you know the thought of the next four<br>years of more of those kind of films<br>just fills me with horror absolute<br>horror<br>so I looked looked at television this<br>kind of television and it's a particular<br>kind of Television it's not I'm not<br>talking about New Zealand television<br>that's uh for another day another<br>discussion I'm talking about the kind of<br>Television long-form complex television<br>that is coming out of all places America<br>and most particularly HBO Breaking Bad<br>Sopranos Fargo True Detective that's the<br>kind of satisfying stories that I'm<br>finding these days and I quite blatantly<br>direct my students towards in terms of<br>the things they ought to be watching<br>so<br>I'm not the only one that worries about<br>these things or kind of declares their<br>Prejudice about these things<br>um British writer Mark commode<br>also writes about the future of film and<br>he writes about other things I'm<br>interested about how film gets made how<br>film gets exhibited and how a film gets<br>distributed because there is now<br>obviously a great sea change taking<br>place in terms of distribution it's a<br>digital world so it's even using the<br>word film may be no longer really valid<br>films are not shot on film anymore<br>they're shot digitally and distributed<br>through digital means and screened<br>through something called DCP or Digital<br>Cinema packages<br>um and now we have the return of 3D but<br>I think 3D has been a really fairly<br>abject failure has anyone said a really<br>good 3D film in the last couple of years<br>yeah maybe Richard has yeah<br>um<br>but they're rare 3D has not really been<br>utilized as it could have been it's just<br>again just tagged onto horrible<br>franchise films<br>okay and also I'm interested in terms of<br>who gets to make films in terms of the<br>personnel<br>and this was in the guardian just<br>recently and it's still very much a boys<br>game despite the fact that research when<br>you look at research who the majority of<br>film guys are female<br>either more than 50 50 60 of people who<br>go to the cinema these days are female<br>and it suggests that<br>um they're not really getting the films<br>that they require or they need or they<br>even want<br>um that it's still pretty much still a<br>male dominated audience in terms of<br>who makes films who distributes films<br>and who screens films despite the end<br>the kind of this kind of myth still<br>persists that films are only viewed by<br>boys age 15 to 24. but no that's not<br>actually the case that the the cinema<br>audience is Shifting dramatically<br>towards a real a female perspective<br>and these are the kind of films that<br>women go to in the greatest numbers<br>so-called Art House films<br>um or quality Cinema<br>and indeed even in New Zealand it's the<br>strongest growing sector of the cinema<br>audience and the plexus are in a sort of<br>either<br>in a kind of stable or insight and<br>decline in terms of the audience that<br>the audiences that are growing strongest<br>New Zealand are the is the Art House<br>and along with that what's been given me<br>a kind of<br>hope this year is there seems to be a<br>Renaissance in local film as well just<br>in the last month I've seen three to<br>four great New Zealand films in<br>particular the Dark Horse of ambina Dark<br>Horse you've got to go to see the Dark<br>Horse what we do in the shadows fantail<br>and there's other films coming along<br>house bounds is the next one<br>so suddenly there's these films which<br>are telling local stories and telling<br>them damn well<br>the thing these are the films that all<br>new zealanders should see<br>I try and get my students along to them<br>but you know it's uphill battle<br>so one of my contribution to all this is<br>I've had this website going for a couple<br>of years it's really about<br>um the places where these films can get<br>can be seen there's more than 100<br>Cinemas independent at our Cinemas in<br>New Zealand scattered all around the<br>place I set up this website to celebrate<br>them<br>some have closed over the last two years<br>but surprisingly new ones have opened<br>everybody's an open neck open necky<br>raised funds locally reopened this<br>Cinema a new Cinemas just opened in<br>Cambridge it's a town that hasn't had a<br>cinema for over 30 years<br>there's a community also um<br>open Cinema in dargaville the Anzac<br>Cinema so to me these are signs of hope<br>that there is still an audience for film<br>and it's audiences the audiences are<br>looking for a particular kind of film<br>and locally we have the Lido it's my<br>local<br>you all should know the Lido<br>it has a kind of the atmosphere of a<br>bordello in the nicest possible way<br>um you know chandeliers and plush carpet<br>and um red velvet curtains and it's a<br>place where you get to see the films<br>that that need to be seen<br>and that is tonight where the<br>international coincidentally the<br>International Film Festival is opening<br>there tonight<br>and also locally we have the Regent in<br>Te awamutu which if you've ever been to<br>is kind of like a Living Museum of film<br>history<br>um it's just wonderful in terms of the<br>uh proprietor has actually gathered<br>together all this kind of detritus from<br>close Cinemas Incorporated in the cinema<br>it's a wonderful place it's kind of a<br>magic place to go to and then Cinemas<br>generally are a magic place to go to<br>and even down the road down State<br>Highway One Thai happy the rural<br>Majestic which is still going and it's a<br>community-run cinema and it shows recent<br>releases<br>one of the problems though obviously<br>these Cinemas are facing in a number of<br>cases as upgrades to digital you don't<br>get film on film anymore you don't get<br>film cans you get your films through<br>flash drives or little digital devices<br>um so you have to have the screening<br>facilities to enable you to use that so<br>that is a problem but most of them<br>tomorrow I just got a um email just a<br>couple days ago from wire and the wire<br>District Council is looking to reopen<br>the um gaiety theater that's been closed<br>for several years and they're actually<br>putting money into digital projection so<br>to me the cinema has always been the<br>kind of scent of a community and it's<br>it's kind of really really heartening to<br>okay and just this last slide this is<br>one of my favorites it says rubies in<br>Wanaka<br>Wanaka has two Art House Cinemas Cinema<br>Paradiso and rubies and it's an<br>experience to go there it was a magic<br>place it's like going to some sort of<br>1930s bar and that is the Delight that<br>going to the cinema for this kind of<br>audience seeking this kind of film is<br>more than just going to film it's about<br>experience it's about the cinema<br>experience but it's also about the<br>experience of the building and the<br>atmosphere<br>so just to finish how am I just about<br>finished<br>as long as you like I'm enjoying it oh<br>no well I'm just about done so does<br>does entertainment media um<br>have a future<br>I think television has a future a kind<br>of Rocky one<br>um an uneven one a patchy one to me<br>television has a future if it continues<br>if HBO continues to pour out that great<br>drama that it produces and then if New<br>Zealand makes more examples of<br>abducted drama like the Louise Nicholas<br>film on Sunday night if it if it could<br>go back and and show some faith and<br>drama series like Harry which is one of<br>the best detective crime fiction series<br>ever made in New Zealand<br>I think television has a<br>um a future but as I say<br>um it has many many pressures upon it<br>does film have a future I think so I<br>think it really depends on our<br>willingness to continue that really<br>curious practice of gathering in the<br>darkened space with a bunch of strangers<br>at a set appointed time<br>and watch something called a film a<br>larger than life experience just one<br>more time<br>so I say to my students you watch films<br>on laptops that's not film that's a form<br>of film film always and must be<br>something larger in life you go to the<br>bloody Cinema to watch films<br>yeah I like the sound of that a return<br>to the boutique getting out of that home<br>theater system and going back into the<br>dark uh with a community of people I<br>enjoyed you mentioning True Detective by<br>the way anyone in the audience seen True<br>Detective hands up yeah it's a couple of<br>you we had we watched the finale about a<br>week ago and I haven't slept since it is<br>truly it starts off as quite a quite a<br>well it is slow I think you know and<br>it's a slow build of it by the end it's<br>like a<br>horrible horrible nightmare<br>but it's good all right<br>please put your hands here then welcome<br>our next speaker author novelist Julie<br>Thomas<br>I'm a bit shorter am I thank you<br>thank you Jesse and again thank you all<br>for coming out on a Winter's Night I'm<br>going to put my glasses on so I can<br>refer to my notes if I need to which<br>means I don't see you very well but<br>never mind it's age<br>in May 2011 I sold up in Auckland and I<br>moved to Cambridge I'd spent over 25<br>years in the media I started in radio<br>then I went to video to television and<br>lastly to film<br>um<br>and I decided that I needed work life<br>balance I'd written um as Jesse said in<br>the introduction I've written since I<br>was eight I used to write the first<br>chapter of novels all the time I used to<br>say to my mother if I don't write I'll<br>boost<br>um and then so I decided if I didn't do<br>it now I would never do it so I was<br>going to sort of semi-retire and I was<br>going to give myself 12 months to see if<br>I could succeed as a self-published<br>author I had three Works already on my<br>computer which was why I knew that I'd<br>know relatively in short time whether it<br>would succeed I had an 85 000 word novel<br>I had a book of six rather quirky short<br>stories and I had my dad's letters that<br>he'd written home during the war<br>first of all the novel<br>um I called it the secret keeper and it<br>was written between 1998 and 2006. it<br>took an enormous amount of research<br>because it's based on fact and I triple<br>checked every single fact because you<br>only need one person to say actually<br>that's wrong and your credibility is is<br>blown and I was working full time as I<br>was writing it it's basically the story<br>of a 1742 delgi surviolin which was<br>looted from a German Jewish Family in<br>Berlin in 1939 and it the book goes from<br>pre-war Berlin through Dachau to Soviet<br>Russia to present day USA and it's it's<br>kind of a sting staged by the the<br>descendants of the family to get the<br>violin back because it gets looted by<br>the Nazis and then it gets looted Again<br>by The Red Army the Soviet Army it's<br>based on fat and it was a very emotional<br>experience to write it and I got to a<br>point where I really wanted the story to<br>get out and be told the other major<br>thing that I had to put up was my dad's<br>wall letters my dad was a Spitfire pilot<br>in World War II<br>he was a reservist too he was called up<br>in 1939 and he served in 485 which was<br>the New Zealand Spitfire Squadron and<br>then after about a year he went out to<br>the Middle East and he served in 23<br>Squadron in what was Persia Southern<br>Iran he was at the fall of to Brook and<br>he delivered Spitfires to Russia for<br>Churchill and he had a really<br>interesting war and when he died I<br>inherited<br>letters that went from 1930 when he was<br>a Schoolboy and his parents went to<br>South Africa went to Africa big gate<br>literally big game hunting and all my<br>grandfather did and right through to<br>1959 and so I took the war letters that<br>he had sent home plus the letters that<br>my grandparents and his younger sister<br>my aunt had written back to him it was a<br>real social history of both England and<br>the Middle East and also Auckland from<br>1939 to 1944 when he came home he was an<br>extraordinary writer he really was<br>amazing and he'd written since about<br>night flying and Spitfires and enemy<br>action over northern France and things<br>so I added them into a 40 000 word book<br>and I put that up as well so on<br>September the 9th 2011 I took a deep<br>breath and I upload I uploaded the novel<br>The War letters and the short stories to<br>Amazon and smashwords both of those<br>sites you should describe as digital<br>bookshelves<br>you can put your books up there doesn't<br>cost you anything to put them up you<br>charge people to buy them but the sites<br>themselves don't really help you to sell<br>them and then in February 2012 I added a<br>fourth book it was a novella it was 40<br>000 words and it was going to be the<br>first of three it was called in vino<br>veritas and it was a genre that's quite<br>popular on Amazon it's called wine crime<br>it's it's black it's funny<br>um and it's full of people murdered<br>using wine<br>bottles of Patrice and drowning in Vats<br>of wine and things like that so let me<br>tell you what my experience was like<br>for the first couple of months I think I<br>sold about 14 copies of the novel and I<br>remember the first time I saw a sale I<br>thought well somebody's bought my work<br>they've paid 99 cents<br>um and then one morning in November<br>um 2011 I woke up and I found I'd sold<br>1500 copies overnight so I thought whoa<br>what's happened here and what had<br>changed was that it had got some<br>five-star reviews and you learn as you<br>go and believe me it's a steep learning<br>curve that Amazon works on an algorithm<br>when you upload your book you're allowed<br>to put two genres and some tags which<br>are just words that people will use<br>within the internal search engine of<br>Amazon to find books and so one of the<br>genres that I'd chosen was Jewish<br>fiction because it is basically a Jewish<br>fiction book<br>and what happened was that people had<br>given it five star reviews it had got on<br>the best seller list for Jewish fiction<br>and so people could find it you know<br>when they wanted jurisdiction they went<br>to the list and there was my book along<br>with sort of 25 others and as it got<br>reviews it Rose higher through that list<br>quite quickly I was number one on that<br>list and I was the only Gentile author<br>on the list and so it starts to sell<br>it's a snowball thing something like<br>that has to happen first smashwords<br>is a basically just a digital<br>distribution you you'd sort of format<br>your book and you email it through to<br>them and they send it out to iTunes Nook<br>um Sony diesel all sorts of other sites<br>and as a non-usa resident I wasn't<br>actually allowed to put anything up on<br>Barnes and Noble except through<br>smashwords and Barnes Noble are very<br>good I sold 9 000 copies of the novel<br>through Barnes and Nobles Barnes Noble<br>in January 2012 so you know it's worth<br>doing<br>so my self-publishing experience was<br>successful on two levels first of all I<br>sold lots of books I sold 50 000 copies<br>of the novel I sold 48 000 copies of the<br>wine crime Novella I sold 42 000 copies<br>of Dad's book and 35 000 copies of the<br>short story God knows who bought them<br>but 35 000 people did on another level I<br>gained a traditional publisher<br>I'm one of those stories that you hear<br>about people say doesn't happen well it<br>does because in May 2012 I got an email<br>from harpercollins USA that actually<br>went into my spam inbox and it had your<br>ebook and what I'd done on the back of<br>all the ebooks the last sort of page was<br>part of the promotion stuff that you do<br>you say thank you for getting to the end<br>of my book this is an email address you<br>can send to you put book alerts in the<br>subject line and I will email you when I<br>have new workout but this didn't say<br>when I started getting book alert I<br>thought what a nurse is this I opened it<br>up and they said really enjoyed your<br>book please tell me when you've got more<br>and so I've got a little sort of folder<br>of them<br>but this one said your ebook and I<br>thought so I transferred it over and<br>very gingerly opened it to find that it<br>was a woman called Carolyn Moreno who<br>was the senior vice president of editing<br>at harpercollins USA and she said I'm<br>quite interested in your writing if<br>you'd like to email me back so I thought<br>about it for about a nanosecond and then<br>I emailed her back and said hello here I<br>am and she eventually we spoke after a<br>few emails and she told me that a<br>literary agent had come up to her at a<br>Book Festival and said that she'd read<br>the book on her Kindle and it was the<br>only book in 40 years that she had to<br>reread again straight away because she<br>couldn't bear to be parted from the<br>characters so Carolyn had read it right<br>place right person right time I ended up<br>with a contract<br>I signed the contract on in June 2012<br>the book was released in June 2013. it's<br>now available in eight International<br>markets and as an e-book and the initial<br>print run was 125 000.<br>my second novel is called blood wine and<br>chocolate and that's released through<br>Harper's in April of next year what I<br>did was I took in vino veritas and I<br>extended it out to 87 000 words made it<br>much blacker much funnier and added<br>death by chocolate<br>so not only do people die with wine but<br>they die with chocolate I won't tell you<br>anymore because it spoils it<br>and I'm now writing a sequel to The<br>Keeper of Secrets which again will be<br>released through Harper's in November of<br>next year and that's called Rachel's<br>Legacy for a long time we didn't think<br>that there was a sequel to it but then I<br>was looking at the violin and at nothing<br>else and then I realized that there's a<br>character in it who dies very young in<br>the war<br>um but she's she's about 18 when she<br>dies but she's in the resistance in<br>Berlin such as it was she's in the Red<br>Orchestra Network and the research that<br>I did to make the little passage about<br>her full of fat was fascinating what<br>there's there was a a luftwaffe general<br>in the luftwaffe ministry in Berlin who<br>was actually a Russian and American spy<br>and sending plans and things out and she<br>works for him and he was a real figure<br>so I thought<br>I've got I do have another book so it's<br>Rachel's Legacy so was it successful<br>yes got me what I couldn't get in any<br>other way quite frankly which was a<br>contract with a traditional publisher<br>so what are the pros and cons of<br>self-publishing<br>the pros are that you have complete<br>control over your book what it looks<br>like what it says it's a direct<br>reflection of you and you alone<br>and you get to keep the substantial<br>amount of the revenue that it generates<br>all 99 Cents well not quite you are your<br>own Master when you look at the<br>statistics Amazon doesn't actually<br>reveal their sales stats but Morgan<br>Stanley say that Amazon earned<br>approximately 4.5 billion dollars in<br>2013 which was up 26 percent on 2012 on<br>Kindle readers alone that's just the<br>sale of Kindle ebook readers and I do<br>know that from November 2011 to February<br>2012 they were selling over A Min a<br>million Kindles a week and that's quite<br>a long time ago in the USA ebook sales<br>make up 30 of all Book Sales and nearly<br>20 of all ebooks are sold through Amazon<br>for Kindles so what does that equate to<br>it equates to millions and millions of<br>people who want something to read<br>smash words also give you exposure to<br>you know Sony and Kobo and Nook and<br>iTunes and all their owners want<br>material as well<br>the cons are that you're competing with<br>over six million other books<br>and that the top 100 books on Amazon<br>make up a third of all the sales<br>so you can see that the rest of them<br>don't sell that much<br>your chances have cut through are really<br>small but they are there and your<br>chances are considerably higher if your<br>work is well proofed and well edited and<br>it has a good Dynamic cover and attracts<br>attention all things that are there to<br>learn on the internet but so many people<br>just write it and stick it up there and<br>expect it to sell<br>so if your self-published book is too<br>highly priced it won't sell nobody knows<br>who you are they don't know whether you<br>can write or not so if you put your book<br>up there at 5.99 they're going to go I'm<br>not going to risk 5.99 but if you put it<br>up there at 99 Cents they think well<br>I'll give it a go<br>um so you actually get less than 50<br>cents per purchase and then you pay tax<br>on top of that if you compare that to<br>2.50 from a traditional publisher for<br>each copy of the book and my novel is is<br>translated into Dutch which was a huge<br>thrill for me and it sells in euros and<br>I get four dollars a copy and it sold 10<br>000 copies so far the Dutch book and I<br>would have to sell 120 000 copies of an<br>ebook to make this amount of money that<br>I've made just from the Dutch publisher<br>now the next con<br>is that you do all the work and I mean<br>all the work you edit it you proof it<br>you design it you get ready to upload<br>there are professionals who do it for<br>you and some of them are very good and<br>there's messes of them on the internet<br>but they will seriously eat into any<br>Revenue that the book might make and all<br>the information on how to do that is<br>there you've just got to take the time<br>to read it and learn it and practice it<br>and then when you finished it and you've<br>uploaded it and you're happy with it<br>then the really hard work starts you<br>have to visit forums and websites that<br>you know you'll find the people that are<br>interested in the genre of your book you<br>blog you Facebook you tweet you get your<br>friends and your friends of your friends<br>and your friends of your friends and<br>then you eventually you wonder why<br>nobody's talking to you because all you<br>ever say to them is by the way do tell<br>people about my book<br>um and you visit numerous sites there<br>are numerous sites set up you know for<br>people that will publish help publicize<br>um self-published books<br>would I do it again of course I would it<br>was an experiment and it worked for me<br>am I glad that I now have a traditional<br>publisher and I get an advance against<br>my royalties and I have experts who do<br>the editing and the proofing and the<br>cover design and the marketing and the<br>promotion and I rock up to the launch as<br>a harpercollins author am I pleased<br>about that you bet<br>so how does accessing books online<br>change the experience for the reader on<br>a practical level you take this little<br>reading device with you and you can take<br>hundreds of books with you you know it's<br>small it's light you can alter the font<br>size you can actually alter the font I<br>think you've got a choice of six fonts<br>if you want to<br>choosing eBooks online is like being in<br>the biggest bookstore in the world you<br>know you you open the book digitally you<br>can read a bit of it you can choose to<br>buy it once you buy it it's there<br>instantly it's downloaded you don't have<br>you know postage or taking it home from<br>the shop or whatever and it's like<br>having more books than you would ever<br>have in the biggest Bookshop in the<br>world<br>is it better it's a very subjective word<br>it's not better it's not worse it's<br>different it's a matter of personal<br>taste<br>it's hard to flick back through an ebook<br>you know like when you think oh what<br>happened back there you know you've got<br>to go through every page and when you<br>hold it in your hand it feels like a<br>piece of technology<br>is reading a paperback a romantic notion<br>from the past I hope not quite frankly<br>nothing feels like a book except a book<br>walking around with an e-Reader on your<br>head won't correct your deportment<br>and you can't have a bookshelf Shelf<br>full of beautiful ebooks<br>I have strong childhood memories of my<br>dad's shed in the garden it was lined<br>floor to ceiling with books there were<br>big ones and small ones and heavy ones<br>and old ones lots and lots of books<br>about planes he had a<br>leather bound set of books by Winston<br>Churchill they were Bound in white<br>leather and they were signed by Winston<br>Churchill and when I was about 10 he<br>gave me a leather-bound set of Jane<br>Austen and I knew from that day what I<br>wanted to do with the rest of my life<br>all my working life in the media I've<br>written and now I just do it all day<br>long I get up in the morning I have<br>breakfast and then I cruise into the<br>office and kick the cat off the computer<br>and I sit there and I write and nothing<br>beats the moment when you hold your own<br>book in your hand absolutely nothing<br>um I can tell you a story when the box<br>of these was delivered because I have an<br>overseas publisher I do everything with<br>Courier by Courier and when the final<br>box was delivered it was a little Indian<br>career driver in Cambridge that<br>everybody knows and he delivered the box<br>and when I realized what they were I<br>kissed him<br>and he dropped everything he dropped the<br>signing thing the box that you know and<br>I just said oh I'm so sorry I've waited<br>40 years for this and he just looked at<br>me and he said are we late<br>oh<br>and I said no it's okay it's it's you<br>can't understand it's my book it's my<br>book and unfortunately I was visiting my<br>mum in a rest home<br>um my mum was there beside me all the<br>way through this journey and she died<br>Christmas day of last year but she did<br>go to the book launch for this so she<br>did see it happen and I went to visit<br>her in the rest home and when I was um<br>on my way back I stopped into countdown<br>to do some shopping in Cambridge and<br>they have these self-bar scan things you<br>know that she can pretend to be a<br>checkout operator and I was putting my<br>groceries through and I looked up and<br>who was next to me but The Courier<br>driver<br>and I would I'm terribly sorry and he<br>just went ah grab the bags took off out<br>the door so I now have a different<br>Courier driver they haven't let him come<br>back to me but that's what it means it's<br>your book so I hope um that's an insight<br>into self-publishing and where it can<br>thank you Julie<br>check your spam folders everyone maybe<br>that's what I've been doing wrong for<br>the last six months<br>it's amazing<br>I love what a purist Julia is as well<br>she said um<br>I didn't think that there was a sequel<br>there but then I looked in the book and<br>I realized that there was if that was me<br>I don't know about you I'd be I didn't<br>think there was a sequel there but then<br>I looked to my bank balance and I<br>realized<br>ladies and Gentlemen please put your<br>hands together for our final speaker<br>so uh yes I'm Megan Whelan from the<br>wireless I've been a radio New Zealand<br>journalist for about 10 years now and<br>about two and a half years ago the then<br>chief executive Peter Kavanagh sent<br>around an email saying we'd like to have<br>a meeting of everyone who thinks uh who<br>is interested in young people and what<br>young people might like from the media<br>and we all sat down and we sat around a<br>table for a morning and we had these<br>fantastic ideas of what we could do and<br>the idea of a youth radio network has<br>been around for a very long time and<br>it's kind of gone out the window the<br>commercial networks would never let it<br>happen happen the government would never<br>let it happen and realistically we know<br>that young people don't listen to the<br>radio very much so why start a radio<br>station just for them so we said in this<br>room and we had all these fantastic<br>ideas of podcasts and recording live<br>bands and putting out CDs and then after<br>lunch Peter came back and said yeah so<br>you're gonna have four staff<br>and we went cool so uh We're not gonna<br>be able to do any of those things great<br>um and so then about a year and a half<br>ago uh four of us sat down and had much<br>the same conversation that Jesse and his<br>team had and said cool so how do we talk<br>to these people that only talk on the<br>internet and live on Facebook and<br>Twitter and that we don't really know<br>them in real life<br>except that some of our team are them<br>and so what we came up with was this so<br>this is the wireless and as Jesse said<br>we aim to produce<br>insightful inspiring and entertaining<br>and occasionally educational content<br>this is how the site looked on Friday I<br>think by memory<br>um we aim for a mix of news and current<br>affairs and personal stories from young<br>people<br>and so why did Radio New Zealand want to<br>do this<br>well we have a charter obligation a<br>legislative legislative obligation to<br>provide information to everyone in the<br>country to everyone that we can<br>regardless of the age their ethnicity<br>their gender whatever they are and for a<br>lot of people Radio New Zealand looks<br>like this<br>there are still men who walk around in<br>shorts like that I will say that<br>um and this is this is a transmitter<br>just outside Wellington it's still there<br>uh I think that photo's from about 1910<br>1915. so it radio hasn't changed a lot<br>radio as it is looks the same<br>but we know that young people aren't<br>listening to radio New Zealand national<br>and Radio New Zealand concerts<br>um we have a very we have a very loyal<br>but small audience of young people and<br>so we thought well how do we put this<br>online because you know Radio New<br>Zealand isn't great at the internet<br>either<br>this is old to be fair but um it's not<br>that old<br>um but when I was looking at this for<br>this presentation I looked at this<br>website and it's from about 2005 and the<br>thing that caught my eye is down the<br>bottom left there Kim Hill at Scott base<br>photos and I thought I really want to<br>see that I want to know what that's<br>about Kim and Antarctica that'd be<br>amazing<br>um and so what this kind of showed me is<br>that content is the most important of<br>what we do and telling stories<br>regardless of how we do it is what's<br>important and so when we talk about the<br>future of entertainment it isn't so much<br>where you're looking at it because<br>people are looking at it everywhere on<br>their phones on their tablets lying in<br>bed at night because they can't sleep so<br>they're scrolling through Twitter on<br>their phone that's where they're finding<br>us<br>and so when we were trying to figure out<br>how to connect with this very scary<br>sounding audience of the millennial<br>generation the digital age how would we<br>talk to them and we thought well let's<br>identify what we don't want to do<br>this is a comment from uh stuff Nation<br>uh and it's on an article about voting<br>and why young people don't vote and this<br>person is basically saying well you know<br>if voting was just like Facebook of<br>course they'd do it because young people<br>only do things because they want<br>attention<br>and you might think well that's stuff<br>Nation you know that's where people go<br>to have horrible fights and don't really<br>say anything of value<br>this was what was in the herald last<br>week when they wrote an editorial about<br>uh young people going on kim.com's party<br>party and how you know government's a<br>bit dull and boring although it hasn't<br>been for the past week government's a<br>bit dull and boring and of course young<br>people aren't interested in it because<br>all they care about is silly<br>entertaining things<br>the following day they had<br>Bob Jones write in an article that young<br>people only care about their cell phones<br>and Facebook and no one reads newspapers<br>anymore and the reason that no one knows<br>about<br>Wars in Nigeria is because no one reads<br>the newspaper anymore to which I'd like<br>to point out that the only reason I know<br>anything is happening in the world<br>anymore is because usually of Twitter<br>which I usually get on my cell phone uh<br>my colleague Al Hunt who is 23 and who<br>is one of the most knowledgeable people<br>I've ever met had this to say in<br>response to Mr Jones<br>that it is actually possible to be both<br>interested in what is happening in the<br>world and play the Kim Kardashian game<br>on your cell phone usually at the same<br>time in the same way that it was<br>possible to be interested in both the<br>Springbok tour and Lionel Richie or<br>Olivia Newton-John and I looked up those<br>names on Wikipedia today<br>to figure out who was in the charts in<br>1981. so what does the wireless do we do<br>what we call issues-based journalism and<br>it's multimedia so we do radio we do uh<br>Well audio we do video we do photos we<br>have funded through Radio New Zealand<br>and we have some money from New Zealand<br>on am which means we get to pay<br>contributors we do things like this this<br>is a young man writing about his<br>experience of mental health and how it<br>affected his employment and how being on<br>the Dole was really bad for his mental<br>health and having a job was great for it<br>if his employer was was good at it we've<br>also been lucky enough to be able to<br>work with videographers<br>everything that is coming from the top<br>is too slow and is too disengaged so I<br>think yeah the community here is<br>essential to getting by out of that has<br>grown the sense of people realizing<br>there's a lot of value in helping others<br>I think the only reason I did stay was<br>because of the earthquakes because I<br>think it's now a more exciting place to<br>be for me personally the city is better<br>now<br>and more engaging now than it was before<br>the earthquakes<br>go out of Christchurch looking at the<br>value of a city and one of the lovely<br>things about it is that so much of the<br>news we hear out of Christchurch which<br>is incredibly important uh is you know<br>dire politics awfulness and this was a<br>video of half a dozen young people<br>talking about how they stayed in<br>Christchurch and how christchurch's new<br>and exciting now for them would they you<br>know before the earthquakes they were<br>planning to leave and now there are<br>things in Christchurch for them and so a<br>lot of what we want to do is tell young<br>people stories because there are very<br>few places in the country and in fact in<br>the world that are doing that that are<br>telling the stories of young people<br>we also work with illustrators this is a<br>one called Meredith Harris and this is<br>her interpretation of our monthly theme<br>this month which is impact and how you<br>might look at impact we also asked an<br>illustrator to look at housing and the<br>election issue of Housing and I wrote<br>about 1500 words about why you might<br>care about housing this election and<br>Hadley did this beautiful illustration<br>which I think makes most of my words<br>pointless because it's a perfect<br>illustration of that issue<br>we also do massive big features this is<br>a two and a half thousand word feature<br>about the state of Mental Health<br>Services in this country and at the same<br>time I made a 25-minute radio<br>documentary<br>um about this the same thing and so we<br>do you know serious proper journalism<br>and then we get illustrators to make<br>silly pictures of the authors<br>uh<br>I also do really really personal really<br>really harrowing stories this is a young<br>woman writing about losing her friend to<br>suicide and I haven't picked on the<br>scary horrible issues it's just we've<br>had a lot of those in the last couple of<br>weeks<br>um<br>my job title oh no one more thing we uh<br>take try to take information and make it<br>more accessible so part of that<br>informing thing on the left hand side of<br>this is how Parliament the parliament<br>website describes how a law is made and<br>we asked an illustrator Meg Howie to<br>draw make it more interesting put that<br>on a page and this has been shared by so<br>many people and is a really nice<br>illustration of how a law is made in<br>this country which if you went to the<br>parliament website and read it it's<br>confusing and dull<br>uh my job title is senior content<br>producer and I hate the word content the<br>internet is full of content and I would<br>argue that maybe what we should do is<br>talk about stories because it's the<br>stories that matter it's not the content<br>and realistically it's not the medium<br>it's fitting the medium to the right<br>story so sometimes stories come in<br>pictures and if you've been watching the<br>news for the past week you'll know that<br>uh who this man is and what he has to<br>say<br>sometimes it comes in the form of radio<br>hopefully if I can make it play<br>the Prime Minister John key is<br>dismissing claims made in a new book by<br>investigative writer Nikki haga the book<br>dirty politics alleges Mr Keegan his<br>office are involved in passing<br>embarrassing and potentially damaging<br>information on their opponents to<br>National Party aligned blogs John Key<br>has rejected that any inappropriate<br>links between his staff and right-wing<br>bloggers Cameron Slater and David Farrah<br>what we've seen is a typical Nikki Hager<br>book I mean quite frankly full of<br>baseless allegations and theories which<br>don't Stack Up<br>story has moved on a little bit in four<br>days<br>um so you know if I'm on the bus or I'm<br>doing the dishes that's how I want to<br>get my information that's how I like to<br>hear these things<br>sometimes I want to be able to read it<br>sometimes I want to be able to sit down<br>and sometimes I want to be able to read<br>it in a book and sometimes I want to be<br>able to read it on the screen and I want<br>lots of words and I want to look at how<br>you know I want to be able to interpret<br>what those say sometimes I want to see<br>yet more video<br>we went down to Wellington to ask people<br>this was late last week we went down to<br>the Waterfront in Wellington to ask<br>people if they had heard of Mr hager's<br>book and if they thought it would<br>foreign<br>information can be backed up I think<br>it's a good thing to kind of get the<br>information out there because there's a<br>lot of dirty politics in every country<br>so it's I think people should make the<br>effort to find out the people that's<br>doing the bad things and get rid of it<br>as I said I don't really know too much<br>about it but would be highly be<br>surprising I mean I think<br>you'd be a knife to think that these<br>sort of things that happen yeah that got<br>no clue in political<br> really I reckon it's all<br>we tried to convince him it wasn't but<br>that's fine<br>um and<br>so the story can be told in a number of<br>ways you can also tell it through the<br>art form or medium of emoji this is<br>again my colleague Al telling the story<br>of dirty Politics the book itself<br>through if you have an iPhone or an<br>Android phone you can get emoji on your<br>phone so in the end of 2011 the labor<br>party was happy<br>oh no the labor party and the green<br>party that's what the little leaves are<br>were happy but it was them against the<br>National Party who were the little blue<br>circle and they were happy John key is<br>the little man with the Thai uh he likes<br>beer and barbecues and golf and rugby<br>and everything is cool so people voted<br>for him<br>etc etc etc<br>different stories being told in<br>different ways but it's the same story<br>and it's a way of getting different<br>people into the story<br>we talk a lot about social media and<br>obviously Twitter and Facebook are<br>ways that we get people to get our<br>information and radio new zealanders<br>itself is very slowly starting to figure<br>out how to do this and part of that is<br>part of growing this audience and<br>becoming more involved in the digital<br>space on Monday morning guyanistaner did<br>what was an incredibly good interview<br>with the Prime Minister<br>asking the word saying is it okay over<br>and over again<br>uh their interview this tweet itself was<br>retweeted about 160 times when I last<br>looked has been favorited a bunch of<br>times it set the news agenda for the day<br>and actually in fact for a couple of<br>days it made the Prime Minister uh put<br>the Prime Minister under quite a lot of<br>pressure<br>and from our point of view from Radio<br>New Zealand's point of view it changed<br>what was happening in the news that day<br>it gave me a bunch of different kinds of<br>content to be able to do that day and<br>this is what was happening behind the<br>scenes<br>this is sessions on the website in<br>Google analytics from<br>uh the day before<br>Sunday which is a quiet day<br>to you can see nine o'clock in the<br>morning<br>uh when that interview was uploaded up a<br>state when that interview was uploaded<br>uh it was listened to in about 24 hours<br>about 30 000 times<br>and obviously shared incredibly widely<br>so it actually doesn't matter what the<br>medium is some people got there through<br>Twitter some people got there through<br>Facebook some people got there because<br>stuff in the herald reprinted the the<br>interview uh some people listen to it on<br>the radio a lot of people listen to it<br>on the radio live and a whole bunch of<br>people got it off the website<br>so yeah what is the changing face of<br>entertainment<br>I think for us for the wireless it's<br>telling<br>the stories of young people<br>and interesting ways and informative<br>ways and hopefully slightly insightful<br>ways and in ways that people are likely<br>to engage with and we spend a fair bit<br>of time figuring out which one is is the<br>right way but the joy of it is that when<br>we get it wrong<br>we can do it again the next day because<br>it's the internet and everything changes<br>almost immediately<br>thank you Megan um well three very smart<br>people with very different perspectives<br>on what media is doing now and where<br>it's going um I'd be delighted to open<br>up to the floor for questions if<br>anyone's got a question they want to ask<br>any of our three speakers or indeed<br>myself<br>um I think we've got a microphone on its<br>way oh there's a microphone over here uh<br>hand up if you want to ask anything of<br>one of our panelists<br>so yeah so one right there and then one<br>one on the front row as well<br>hello<br>I have a question for Megan<br>just on the wireless that a lot of<br>stories from journalists have quite a<br>personal aspect to it and I wonder how<br>you felt<br>sort of spearing your soul online for a<br>story<br>um there's a song yes it's uh it's<br>incredibly confronting for me as a<br>journalist as kind of an Old School<br>radio journalist I'm not the story in<br>fact I want to stay as far away from the<br>story as I possibly can what we know<br>through a bunch of research that we have<br>done ourselves and uh have been done<br>overseas is that<br>young people don't and I hate using the<br>term young people but there really isn't<br>another way to say it young people don't<br>connect with media in the same way that<br>my parents generation does Radio New<br>Zealand isn't as recognized a brand for<br>my colleagues as it is for my parents<br>and<br>they recognize people because we all<br>have personal relationships on the<br>internet you know people from the<br>internet there's a couple of people in<br>the audience that I know from the<br>internet and that is the only way I know<br>them<br>um well no I know them in real life now<br>but yeah I met them on the Internet<br>um and so what we know is they they<br>connect with storytellers because they<br>feel like they know them so when I so I<br>wrote a along with that big feature<br>about mental health I also wrote a story<br>of my own<br>battle with depression<br>and talked a little bit about that and<br>there were two reasons for doing it one<br>was that it felt incredibly disingenuous<br>actually to to make half my friends talk<br>to me about their mental health and put<br>it on the radio and not do the same<br>thing myself but also it was another way<br>to get people connect to the bigger<br>issue and so what we do is we ask we get<br>people to tell their personal stories<br>and most of the time they're really<br>willing to do that in fact<br>probably about two-thirds of the<br>pictures we get from our contributors<br>are personal stories I want to write<br>about the time I did this<br>and<br>I was terrified about putting that<br>article up because I had no idea what<br>the reaction was going to be and it was<br>incredibly positive it was amazing<br>um and but the amazing thing about it is<br>that you can see<br>when we published the article it was<br>three days after the Insight documentary<br>went to Air and two days after the main<br>big feature was published and almost<br>every person who read my story either<br>listened to the Insight or read the<br>feature and that's ultimately why we did<br>it because my story actually made people<br>look at the issue<br>and yeah it was terrifying but it was<br>totally worth it<br>my questions for Jeff and it's relating<br>to the current International Film<br>Festival<br>the version that we're getting in<br>Hamilton seems to be a very paired down<br>version from what's in Auckland and I'm<br>just wondering who's making those<br>decisions is it someone in Auckland<br>saying we don't need to see it or is it<br>the Lido saying it won't fly<br>uh it's probably a number of factors<br>quite a number of the films that were um<br>on an Auckland are getting a general<br>release like Boyhood for example and 20<br>000<br>um hours of my life they run about Nick<br>Cave so that's one reason<br>um<br>smaller Cinemas here a Lido um two three<br>screens<br>um<br>but the interesting thing is and Bill<br>Gosden says himself who's directed the<br>festival that Hamilton has won the best<br>performing centers for the International<br>Film Festival in fact it does as well in<br>some ways is Auckland and Wellington do<br>given its population base<br>so yeah it does when you see look at the<br>get the Auckland program then you get<br>this kind of slim version and Hamilton<br>there's a there's a wee bit<br>disappointing but there are some damn<br>good films in it nevertheless<br>and the good news you'll be getting all<br>22 superhero movies so that's something<br>to look forward to<br>the other questions from the audience<br>my questions for Julie for starters<br>welcome to Cambridge jewelry it's much<br>and with the<br>um so much crossover<br>with writing genres now how much how<br>important do you find it is to have a a<br>distinct voice in your writing is it<br>something that is going to set you apart<br>or<br>does it not really matter that much<br>it's an interesting<br>because when I did Secrets it's a<br>particular type of book it's a<br>historical although it has some<br>contemporary fiction in it it's<br>basically a historical story and<br>um I had a contract I had a clause in my<br>original contract for the next book and<br>very quickly happy Colin said to me so<br>what historical fiction are you going to<br>write next<br>and I thought oh really and I said to<br>them actually I want to I've got this<br>idea about writing a book<br>um and I want to do I want to create a<br>detective and she's a retired racehorse<br>trainer and it's a cross between dick<br>Francis and Agatha Christie and they<br>just went no they said everybody who<br>reads your book will expect it a certain<br>kind of book<br>um it's taken me a while to persuade<br>them that that is really not me I've<br>always written widely everything from<br>board reports to poetry you know in my<br>writing life and I don't want to be<br>stuck in a genre so against their advice<br>I wrote blood wine and chocolate and<br>said don't judge it until you read it<br>and and my New Zealand editor now is uh<br>Finley McDonald<br>in Auckland and he came back to me and<br>said I pissed myself laughing it was so<br>funny and I said do you want it and he<br>said oh yes so you know it's it's a<br>balancing act as a writer you have to<br>think commercially you honestly have to<br>think they're investing a huge amount of<br>money and they need to know that the<br>book is going to sell if you've sold a<br>few thousand copies<br>it gives you a bit of Leverage<br>and and I thought will I use it or won't<br>I use it because the first time it was<br>yes sir no sir anything you say this<br>time I thought for my own Artistic<br>integrity I have to stand up and say I'm<br>going to explore other things when I<br>finished Rachel's Legacy that whole<br>section will be over and I can give life<br>to my equine detective and get back to<br>board reports no no I don't think so<br>uh questions for Jeff my sisters lives<br>in the United States and she speaks of<br>Netflix and they get streamed movies on<br>a monthly account<br>now I look at that they don't have many<br>DVD stores for monarching gather and I'm<br>wondering in New Zealand will that same<br>sort of thing happen here where most<br>movie content comes through the internet<br>not through the DVD store that we know<br>so well and we go down and get it out<br>and return it Lane<br>yeah well there is talk about Netflix<br>coming next year possibly it's New<br>Zealand we have got some services like<br>lightbox but you look at what live box<br>is offering it's stuff that's already<br>been screened it's largely repeat stuff<br>whether Netflix regards New Zealand as a<br>bigger big enough kind of population<br>base I don't know but again it's still<br>delivering films to devices where I<br>don't think films are ideally seen so<br>long live the bloody Cinema really I'm<br>saying you can see films wherever you<br>want to but we need to maintain those<br>said there about income from books uh I<br>do think it's absolutely that<br>some people were saying about Nikki<br>Hager making money out of that book<br>because you know any author published<br>New Zealand you don't make a lot of<br>money and that's not as reason for<br>any more questions we've got time for<br>one or two more hello yeah we'll take<br>you on the um in the back row<br>um I have a question about<br>um<br>the books<br>um do you find people<br>um have a better interest and stories<br>that are first person or third person<br>that's an interesting question do you<br>even think about it or do you just start<br>writing<br>um actually I do think about it because<br>I very nearly wrote Rachel's Legacy in<br>the first person<br>um I find first person harder to write<br>simply because if you're in third person<br>and you're doing uh what they sort of<br>call a god-eye narration then you can<br>see what everybody's thinking and what<br>everybody's feeling whereas a true first<br>person narration is only that person's<br>thoughts and emotions<br>um<br>they're both perfectly legitimate ways<br>it's it's just how the story tells<br>itself and I plan it out and I have an<br>overall Arc and I know where I want the<br>characters to go and then you just start<br>and if it doesn't work well then you'll<br>try it another way and for Rachel's<br>Legacy I have tried it because it's<br>basically a diary written by a dead<br>person<br>I have tried it several different ways<br>so it's it's purely personal choice<br>I suspect the majority of books are<br>written in third person because it's<br>when I was your age I used to read books<br>called twister plot which were in the<br>second person if you can believe it uh<br>room for one more if we've got one more<br>yes hello let's come up to the second<br>right here please the lady in the middle<br>I'm sorry Julie Julie I read your book<br>and<br>um when Rachel what happened to Rachel<br>at the start oh spoiler alert I couldn't<br>believe I couldn't believe what happened<br>so I'm really PL and I went I'm sure I<br>know what's going to happen she's going<br>to live happily ever after<br>and she didn't<br>sorry I'd actually didn't give that away<br>um and so I'm really pleased that you've<br>written a sequel to give her some<br>not life but yeah because she said it<br>was so tragic yeah to give it a voice<br>those characters uh I did years and<br>years and years of research and those<br>characters are<br>um emblems of the things that I found I<br>found I read hundreds of Survivor<br>stories I watched hundreds of footage I<br>watched 200 hours of violin music<br>um and I watched Band of Brothers<br>Liberation for the our switch you know I<br>watched all sorts of stuff and as I<br>found a generalized thing like I found<br>fathers who would not believe that that<br>I mean this guy in the book Benjamin is<br>a banker and he just does not believe<br>that that the Nazis will do this to him<br>because he he has government contracts<br>and all of a sudden they turn up at his<br>bank and kick him out you know and and<br>there is a certain level of blindness<br>and naivety I found characters that<br>tried to run away all sorts of things<br>and and Incorporated them and the<br>resistance in Berlin is a fascinating<br>story and it's a story that very few<br>people know about it's the same with the<br>Soviet women pilots that's another<br>aspect that I'd like to bring out<br>because they were incredibly Brave you<br>know they flew without parachutes and<br>and they wore men's boots with<br>newspapers stuffed in them and they<br>basically flew you know fighter planes<br>in combat for the Soviet Union and<br>yes that there's hundreds of untold<br>stories I can keep going until I'm 90.<br>hmm<br>um but we're gonna finish at seven so<br>um we will stick around if you want to<br>come up and say hello to us uh if you<br>know someone who might have enjoyed this<br>lecture it's going to be on iTunes you<br>so you can look it up and listen to it<br>again for your pleasure uh I'm now I'll<br>ask you to put your hands together for<br>and I'd welcome uh acting Vice<br>Chancellor Professor Jones back onto the<br>stage<br>uh thank you Jesse for hosting uh<br>tonight's lecture uh to Jeff uh Julie<br>and Megan for sharing your thoughts<br>insights and experiences um I think it's<br>been a riveting

City Planning property<br>development demography about as they<br>examine how Hamilton can learn from<br>other cities who've gone through<br>successful revitalization processes<br>uh thank you again
