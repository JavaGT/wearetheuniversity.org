It didn't even exist a few years ago but is now a reflection of the world in which we operate. While it is evident that online crime is increasing, recent revelations of security loopholes experienced by large governmental organisations such as WINZ and ACC show just how vulnerable everyone is. With an increased reliance on computing devices and environments such as cloud computing, are we exposed to higher risks? Just how safe is our information in this brave new world? Hear from NetSafe Chief Executive and digital safety advocate, Martin Cocker, Computing and Mathematical Science Senior Lecturer and head of the University of Waikato's new Cyber Security Lab, Dr Ryan Ko and online legal expert and Faculty of Law Senior Lecturer, Wayne Rumbles, on how to enhance your digital safety.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening uh everybody my name is<br>alist Jones and I'm the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor of the University of wo and<br>it's my pleasure to welcome you here uh<br>to the second lecture in this year's<br>winter lecture series first of all I'd<br>like to pass on the apologies of our<br>vice Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford<br>who is not able to be here today before<br>we get started um I'd like to advise of<br>some house housekeeping matters uh if<br>you'd like to use the amenities the<br>restrooms are located in the foyer<br>opposite the Opus bar in case of<br>emergency please exit by the doors at<br>each side of the op SP ushers and event<br>staff are on hand to assist you out<br>safely the assembly area is outside the<br>academy and the shops and you're not to<br>ENT re-enter the building until the all<br>clear is given by the front of house<br>manager or Personnel I had to read those<br>words exactly uh so if you could also<br>check um that your mobile phones and<br>devices are turned<br>off uh the in the winter lecture series<br>is where we take the opportunity to<br>showcase to the community the wealth of<br>knowledge and expertise that is on hand<br>at the University among our among our<br>academics in their various research<br>projects and also our alumni and guest<br>speakers one of the important things of<br>a university is the way we connect with<br>our community both in terms of the<br>knowledge that uh we convey but inviting<br>people into the our community as well<br>this year's series is a special one we<br>are marking 50 years of teaching and<br>research Excellence at this<br>University 2014 winter lecture Series<br>has a forward focused theme as we look<br>to the Future and start thinking about<br>the next 50 years and Beyond tonight's<br>lecture focus on the future of cyber<br>security and just prior to this event we<br>had the unveiling of a plaque<br>commemorating the date John Hawker<br>plugged New Zealand into the internet<br>right here at the University of woto the<br>plaque will be available for viewing in<br>the 4y year after the<br>lecture it is now my pleasure to<br>introduce to you tonight's<br>facilitator senior Lector and law Brenda<br>midson Brenda Will introduce each of<br>tonight's speakers keeping them of<br>course to time and taking any questions<br>at the end of presentations thank you<br>Brenda thank you Professor<br>Jones I'm a senior lecturer here at<br>Tanga faculty of law where right teach<br>in criminal law and evidence and also in<br>criminology which looks at the vast<br>range of human behaviors and asks among<br>other things why certain acts are<br>criminalized and others not and also<br>what can be done done to regulate new<br>and emerging areas of potentially<br>criminal Behavior we've already been<br>talking uh on the stage tonight about<br>some really high-tech stuff including<br>how to get the best selfies apparently<br>you take them from up high and also<br>we've been talking about the<br>Kardashians so uh it's a pleasure to be<br>here facilitating this winter lecture<br>series session tonight we're going to<br>hear from Martin Cocker who's the chief<br>executive of Nets safe we'll be hearing<br>from Dr Ryan Co who's a senior lecturer<br>here at the University in Computing and<br>mathematical sciences and he's also head<br>of the cyber security lab and also<br>senior Lector in law Wayne rumbles and<br>I'll briefly introduce each of them to<br>you before we hear Martin speak Martin<br>will be our first Speaker tonight Martin<br>joined Nets safe as chief executive in<br>2006 after working in the ICT industry<br>for 12 years net safe is an independent<br>nonprofit organization that promotes<br>safe and responsible use of online<br>Technologies they have several<br>Partnerships across a range of sectors<br>and groups all working across cyber<br>bullying cyber security educational<br>resources consumer protection and policy<br>advice and development in New Zealand<br>and also across the Pacific recent<br>projects include the creation of the<br>netsafe cyber bul bullying task force<br>involvement with the government's new<br>cyber security strategy and the<br>development of consumer advice around<br>smartphone security<br>Dr Ryan Co is senior lecturer uh in the<br>faculty of computing and mathematical<br>Sciences Ry is an acknowledged expert in<br>cloud computing<br>security he's also head of the<br>University cyber security<br>lab prior to joining the University of<br>wle Ryan was lead computer scientist<br>with h huid Packard Labs cloud and<br>security lab and he's a co-chair and<br>board member of several cyber security<br>industry bodies<br>in 2012 Ryan was a recipient of the Ron<br>node service award for his volunteer<br>efforts with the not for-profit Cloud<br>security<br>Alliance Wayne rumbles graduated from<br>the University of wo in 1997 with<br>Bachelor's of Art and law and in 1998<br>with his Masters in law he then spent<br>three years working in Community Law and<br>for 10 years for timari research<br>institute on the laws and institutions<br>for our New Zealand project Wayne<br>teachers in the areas of crime<br>criminology Cyber Law and legal<br>responses to new technologies and he<br>also teaches in the Masters of cyber<br>security Wayne's current research<br>projects include the sentencing of<br>hacker crimes across jurisdictions and<br>the legal issues of cloud<br>computing as I said we will first hear<br>from Mr Cocker then Dr Co followed by Mr<br>rumbl so would you please welcome Martin<br>CER<br>oh thank you I don't often get called Mr<br>Cocker um most of us people try to avoid<br>Cocker for obvious reasons uh all right<br>uh because I work in technology I I'm<br>very confident with technology and I<br>therefore don't do any prep work like<br>seeing how stuff works before I get on<br>stage<br>so all right that's going well um so<br>Nets safe as was just mentioned as a uh<br>not for profit uh our job is to try to<br>create a safe and more secure online<br>environment in New Zealand uh and help<br>new zealanders uptake digital<br>opportunities um I cut and past some of<br>these slides from presentations I give<br>around the world where I take some of<br>our local culture to the world which is<br>why you'll see that there's the odd uh<br>local marry proverb and in this case uh<br>people say to me isn't cyber safety and<br>you know trying to educate people about<br>all these challenges you know impossible<br>task and I say well we won't die like an<br>octopus we'll die like a hammerhead<br>shark which apparently means you know go<br>down<br>fighting uh so on that upbeat start<br>let's talk about what net safe does uh<br>and I see that uh nobody's taking notes<br>so uh pretty much anything you need to<br>know you can about net safe and net safe<br>education program and the information<br>netsafe holds you can find somewhere<br>linked off netsafe<br>org.nz so that's all you got to remember<br>that's your take-home from Martin I'm<br>sure Ryan will have lots more be much<br>harder you probably want to take notes<br>netsafe do.org<br>NZ and uh and we work a lot with schools<br>so if you got children and uh or<br>grandchildren they're in schools uh it's<br>it's likely those schools are engaged<br>with Nets safe through uh their own<br>specific resources and and processes uh<br>trying to create a safe environment at<br>school and help young kids to become<br>what we call digital citizens and you<br>know capable users of<br>Technology uh we work with lots of other<br>groups this is the output of the<br>ministry of education's Le uh bullying<br>prevention Advisory Group the bpeg which<br>has a cyber bullying spin-off the CB Peg<br>because we like to have acronyms in ICT<br>and apparently in education so we work<br>lots of other groups on projects like<br>that and we have something called the<br>orb which is uh a place where you can<br>report cyber crimes and cyber offenses<br>so when you come across something online<br>that you think looks like a crime or an<br>offense you can go to the or.org NZ or<br>if you forget that it's called the orb<br>you can go to netsafe org.nz and find it<br>from there so<br>what do we see from the orb we see how<br>uh what challenges new zealanders are<br>facing online and uh each year in the<br>for the last couple years in the orb<br>we've received um reports with a total<br>Financial loss of $5<br>million so one of the questions people<br>ask a lot is how big how big a problem<br>is cyber crime in New<br>Zealand well that's the reported losses<br>to us but uh a couple of years ago<br>Norton did a report and they said that<br>the cost of cyber crimes in New Zealand<br>was 600 $ 60<br>million and they were widely criticized<br>for you know pulling this number out uh<br>but then they did the same research a<br>couple of years later and they found<br>that uh that the just the straight<br>Financial loss cost of cyber crime was<br>$400<br>million um but of course this is all<br>extrapolated from how many people may or<br>may not have um as good<br>feedback uh how many people may or may<br>not have uh of um uh lost money<br>security incident so forth so what we<br>can say is that uh the problem is<br>getting worse uh because um NZ stats who<br>are a pretty reliable gatherer of<br>information they do something called the<br>ICT household labor force survey know<br>the IC doesn't matter uh they do the<br>household labor for survey ICT section<br>and they ask people who had suffered a<br>loss uh as a result of some cyber<br>security incident or or cyber crime and<br>the first time they did the report back<br>in uh 2009 2% of people said they'd<br>suffered in<br>2012 uh that number had risen to 4% and<br>if you extrapolate the average loss in<br>the orb by 4% of new zealanders then you<br>get a number about $150 million so<br>whatever it is between 150 million and<br>money and the trends that we are seeing<br>so uh everybody here will have heard<br>about Rod Drury in zero and how he's<br>taking his accounting product to the<br>world and he's doing really well and<br>that people talk often about the Flat<br>Earth and weightless economy uh and<br>basically all that means is that um you<br>know you don't have to export on it you<br>just plug into the internet and you're<br>in another country well cyber criminals<br>have worked that out too so they plug in<br>in one place and then they uh they<br>attack another country and uh what we're<br>seeing is a trend in terms of countries<br>are becoming one or the other either a<br>perpetrator country or a victim country<br>and um you'll be sad to know New Zealand<br>is a victim country that uh you know<br>we're mostly losing money and sending it<br>off offshore our criminals haven't<br>cottoned onto the opportunity yet and<br>they're not bringing money back into the<br>country so uh although I was with some<br>law enforcement guys the other day and<br>they were very confident that our<br>criminals would catch up so you know<br>it's it's patriotism at its best there<br>and the other thing we're seeing uh is<br>these data breaches on a mass scale so<br>this is just a a screen grab from a uh a<br>a a graphic a cool interactive thing<br>where you can go through and you can<br>have a look at all the major data<br>breaches over the over the last little<br>while and some of them are gigantic so<br>the eBay one stands out there in the<br>Middle with 145 million lost records uh<br>but you know OTE Facebook Living Social<br>Apple America Online they're all losing<br>from time to time large chunks of data<br>and that data then floats around uh and<br>criminals can access it uh and despite<br>our best efforts you know that<br>information is is out<br>there so as I mentioned uh you know<br>criminals are cottoning on to the<br>opportunity of of the digital age a and<br>uh you know we can assume that whatever<br>is the next technology and you know we<br>could probably get a futurist up here<br>and they' wow us with all these new<br>technologies and then someone who's<br>slightly pessimistic about uh you know<br>cyber security and cyber crime like Ryan<br>uh could uh identify all the ways that<br>will be exploited by by cyber<br>criminals but basically we try to put<br>things into three buckets and this is a<br>bit of theoretical thing for our cyber<br>safety Buffs uh the three areas cyber<br>security cyber safety and cyber crime<br>cyber safety is about people in their<br>actions and therefore their mistakes so<br>uh you know I might take a picture of<br>myself in the bathroom forget that I<br>didn't have any clothes on uh and<br>accidentally upload it that would be<br>just a pure cyber safety<br>error um actually I'm sorry I sort of<br>created that<br>example could be a bit awkward he<br>supposed a picture the crowd naker not<br>the presenter um if if I sent that<br>picture to my uh beloved and then we<br>broke up and uh and she you know<br>blackmailed me with it that would be a<br>criminal act and and it would be<br>something which was both a cyber safety<br>era and a cyber crime if somebody hacked<br>my phone and stole those images and then<br>blackmail with it it would be a<br>cybercity cyber safety and cyber crime<br>issue and it's in that area where these<br>different uh um challenges overlap that<br>that you have the most interesting cases<br>from our perspective and also the most<br>difficult challenges because<br>organizations don't tend to be skilled<br>at uh all all three of those<br>areas so just sort I'd run through a<br>couple of their sort of um favorite<br>scams uh what's happening at the moment<br>so who's been called by the PC Doctor or<br>someone from Microsoft or some other<br>agency now it's Telecom actually um to<br>help you with your computer just show a<br>hands<br>every all right they really do well<br>don't they they got great coverage these<br>guys um I won't ask who's handed them<br>money but people do uh and um the reason<br>that people do is because uh it's<br>they've got a really you know Civ model<br>that they've refined over the last few<br>years and it's quite compelling um so<br>we're seeing a lot of the PC Doctor and<br>that was indicated by what happened here<br>uh we've seen quite a lot of uh attacks<br>on what you call sort of secondary<br>sources of funds so uh trade me account<br>there's no money in your tradem me<br>account well except for the little bit<br>of credit you give trade me to run your<br>your trades um but your tradem me<br>account is valuable so so people Target<br>those uh on mass and you know from time<br>to time we see tradem me here Ally<br>targeted that way we had a lady ring up<br>and say um oh it's terrible help me I've<br>lost the<br>farm and that was quite confusing for<br>the staff CU we're like uh you know this<br>is a cyber safety organization but it<br>turned out the farm she was talking<br>about was<br>Farmville and uh she was very upset but<br>what had happened to someone had hacked<br>her Facebook account uh and the thing<br>that she was most concerned about was<br>that uh she'd lost control of her<br>Farmville farm and the crops would<br>die um but of course the biggest problem<br>was that somebody was now in control of<br>her Facebook account account and we've<br>seen this quite a bit and therefore and<br>then connecting with her contacts and<br>saying to her things like uh to the to<br>her contacts you know I'm stuck in a<br>foreign country I'm in London I've been<br>jammed up lost of money Etc um and they<br>also use the now they've move from just<br>posting to uh to using the live chat<br>within these products so they wait to<br>see who of your friends are online and<br>then they live chat with them and you'd<br>think you know surely with a a live text<br>chat you'd sort of recognize it wasn't<br>your friend because they wouldn't be<br>using the normal kind of language they<br>use but people do fall for this on a on<br>a regular basis because you know you<br>just don't think the person who's<br>friend uh we see quite a few trading<br>scams um uh international trading scams<br>so we had one where a guy brought a<br>tractor overseas typical kind of a thing<br>you put down a deposit uh they send you<br>a shipping document let you know<br>tractor's on the way tractor got stuck<br>in Madagascar we need some more money to<br>clear it Madagascar Customs Etc they<br>just keep asking for money until you<br>realize it's a scam and uh and people<br>hand over lots and lots of small chunks<br>of money I say small chunks of money in<br>that case it was a total of sort of<br>$70,000 but often it's $1,000 $2,000 and<br>when you add it all up it's $1<br>$220,000 romance scams everybody's<br>favorite very compelling uh romance<br>scams we don't see as many romance scams<br>as the other ones but they tend to be<br>very high value once you're committed to<br>a relationship you tend to pour a lot of<br>money into it that's true whether it's a<br>scam one or a real one um<br>and and uh and so we see a lot of people<br>uh when we see romance scans when people<br>report them they tend to have big<br>Financial losses associated with<br>them uh popular at the moment jump<br>online going back to the bathroom story<br>again take your clothes off um have a a<br>bit of adult play uh online happening<br>quite a lot sometimes the person on the<br>other end records<br>it and then writes to you later on and<br>says I recorded that session we had<br>online uh please give me some money or<br>please they're so polite they're not<br>like this give me money uh or I will<br>tell your boss or I'll release the video<br>or I'll tell your family and you know um<br>that's a pretty compelling uh uh<br>argument and everybody's uh everybody's<br>personal favorite in the security<br>industry crypto Locker your uh computer<br>gets infected with some mware<br>and uh you get a message on your screen<br>to tell you that it's your computer's<br>been locked now it's very seldom that<br>they say I mean a couple of them do just<br>say look we're criminals and we've<br>locked your computer but most of them<br>tend to pop up a message that says we're<br>the FBI or we're a foreign you know<br>police agency and you've been doing<br>something you shouldn't and give us<br>money and we'll unlock your computer um<br>the better crypto Locker programs<br>are the encryption is neon it's it's<br>realistically irreversible so if you get<br>it you're stuffed unless you pay the<br>ransom or you had the data backed up and<br>so unfortunately quite a few people pay<br>the<br>ransom so just in terms of what what do<br>we do as a as a country or as<br>individuals uh you know how do we make<br>the uh the environment safer the<br>internet safer so the first problem is<br>we have to define the uh the internet as<br>two separate things on the one layer the<br>internet is a bunch of uh devices that<br>operate to a standard and pass data<br>around that is the internet the guy on<br>the bottom vent Sur he sort of invented<br>the way it works<br>now then there's the web layer that's<br>what we think of and people say the<br>internet we're really thinking of the<br>web layer and the guy on the top Tim<br>berners Lee he's the guy who who has<br>invented the kind of uh the the<br>protocols that we use and make the<br>internet work on that level so um the<br>problem is neither of them are<br>particularly governed with the idea of<br>safety in mind the internet is designed<br>to pass data around as effectively as<br>possible and the web is just I don't<br>think it was really designed it's just<br>just a standard and and you know people<br>build whatever they want on it so uh<br>starting at that kind of international<br>let's fix the internet layer doesn't<br>really sort of work so what you end up<br>doing is you end up trying to protect<br>yourself at the edge that's us and so we<br>make security decisions at the edge of<br>the internet to to protect ourselves the<br>problem is there's a whole lot of<br>devices on the edge uh in in my house I<br>think there's sort of 14 or 15 now I<br>might be slightly more inclined to have<br>lots of technical toys than the average<br>person but if you count in your house<br>between your smartphones and your<br>laptops and your tablets and if you<br>bought one of those new Samsung TVs you<br>find there's a whole lot of things that<br>attach to the internet things you don't<br>even think about like the games console<br>and so forth there's basically three<br>things that protect these computers or<br>these devices at at a core level four I<br>suppose if you count welld designed in<br>the first place uh but there are three<br>things that we think about one is that<br>the device is constantly up toate<br>whatever is a software on it's up to<br>date so if anyone owns a PlayStation<br>they know every every now and then you<br>jump online to play on your PlayStation<br>and the PlayStation says sorry I've got<br>to do an update and as frustrating as<br>that is that's actually quite a good<br>design because they're saying we know<br>that there's something about this design<br>this machine that has to be updated and<br>we're not going to give you the choice<br>to avoid it right so they and other<br>devices where you have the choice people<br>sometimes make that choice which makes<br>them vulnerable so keeping things up to<br>date the other thing is some sort of<br>security software so on the PlayStation<br>any security software is built in by<br>Sony but on my uh Apple phone if I want<br>security software I got to get a third<br>party app and put that on on my laptop I<br>put it on really the idea of security<br>software is when other things go wrong<br>the security software sort of kicks in<br>and saves us doesn't do everything but<br>that's kind of its job it's sort of<br>Milling around on your computer waiting<br>for you to make a mistake and then try<br>to reverse that<br>mistake uh and then the other thing that<br>we have is we have some sort of<br>firewalling system firewalls are mostly<br>invisible now we used have to turn them<br>on only 5 years ago you'd turn on a<br>firewall but a firewall is essentially<br>something that stops a person looking<br>into the device from the outside seeing<br>what's on the inside of the device<br>that's the best way to describe it it's<br>like a couple of doors that are offset<br>and when you look in you can't see what<br>through the other door uh and most<br>devices have a firewall uh set by<br>default to on if they don't then it's<br>like a just a pipe straight<br>through the other thing that we can do<br>is we can make the environment uh we can<br>we can use regulations and law to make<br>the environment safer now this is<br>obviously uh poses some challenges but I<br>think may be discussed a little bit<br>later on uh in terms of jurisdiction but<br>there there is a piece of law before the<br>house before Parliament at the moment<br>called the harmful digital<br>Communications bill and there's actually<br>a really interesting lesson in that law<br>for us non-legal people and that is that<br>there are safety processes developing<br>organically in the environment and that<br>if you think about regulation smartly<br>you use that you build on the existing<br>processes now I don't want to get too<br>nerdy but I have put up a lot of arrows<br>and just to explain how this works if<br>you have a problem on Facebook you can<br>report to Facebook you can also report<br>to Nets safe and Nets safe acts as an<br>intermediary and an expert subject<br>matter<br>expert we have three courses available<br>to us one we can tell you your problem<br>is not serious enough to for us to take<br>further action we will say that more<br>gently but that is essentially what we<br>mean we'll pass it back to you and you<br>can wait through the normal processes<br>secondly we can say we think your pro<br>your problem is serious enough you're a<br>young child and you're at risk or blah<br>blah blah and we will bypass all of the<br>slow processes at Facebook with our uh<br>special relationship that we have and<br>have content removed or or blocked Etc<br>that's option number two and option<br>number three is we can say that is a<br>very interesting story you've told us<br>that is a criminal act and then we can<br>pass that information to our law<br>enforcement partners and the harmful<br>digital Communications bill again not to<br>get into too much detail about that<br>because cyber bullying but basically it<br>saw that process in action and it tried<br>to create tried to pump some more<br>resource into that process to make that<br>process work better and faster uh<br>through through this civil remedies<br>process<br>there um and then of course what we try<br>to do is we try to educate people at at<br>at the edge I've been doing that by<br>explaining to you how firewall Works uh<br>Nets safe has this um series of of cyber<br>security uh it has a whole lot of cyber<br>security advice on the net saafe website<br>uh as was mentioned in the intro we work<br>with the government they've created a<br>new brand called connect smart so you<br>can look up connect smart uh and you'll<br>um there are some standard things that<br>we can tell you have a strong password<br>and I can explain to you what a strong<br>password is right you will have been<br>watching and paying attention to this<br>presentation right from the start and<br>you'll remember all those big data<br>breaches and you'll think it doesn't<br>matter how strong my password was if<br>someone stole it that is true<br>nonetheless if you have strong passwords<br>and they and they vary between sites<br>that is going to make you more less<br>likely to suffer a serious breach you're<br>going to secure your wireless network<br>because unsecured wireless networks are<br>a target for criminals to attach to uh<br>and undertake some criminal activity<br>which gets traced back to your wireless<br>network and therefore you uh you're<br>going to back up your files because you<br>heard about that crypto Locker thing<br>that that Martin guy was talking about<br>and he said I've got two choices if I<br>get crypto Locker one pay the ransom or<br>two go to a backup if I don't have a<br>backup I've only got one option so I'm<br>going to put them back up in place I'm<br>going to update everything because<br>that's uh that's just the foundation of<br>of uh of successful security and I'm<br>going to think before I click and I have<br>to say this is the hardest part of the<br>whole education program make good<br>choices<br>online don't get tricked these are all<br>great slogans but how how effective uh<br>are they you know you it takes a long<br>time to develop the kind of deep<br>knowledge of uh of cyber criminals<br>activities and trickery to always<br>guarantee that you won't fall for th for<br>those things but instead what we do is<br>we make up cutesy uh things like this<br>the fishing poster uh see fishing with a<br>pH a little technical joke uh and looks<br>like the thing you see in the in the<br>takeaways and just try to raise the<br>profile all the time just get people<br>thinking about it<br>because the number one thing to keep you<br>secure online is to be constantly aware<br>of the fact that you are facing risk<br>that the that the person who is<br>presenting to you may not be the person<br>presenting to you that the website being<br>presented to you may not be the people<br>you think are behind it be constantly<br>aware of that constantly V Vigilant<br>about that and you're much more likely<br>to be safe so I'll leave it there and<br>guess thank you Martin um I'll call you<br>Martin from now on I won make this that<br>mistake twice uh I should have said<br>earlier that we will have time for<br>questions at the end so if you've got a<br>present question just hold on to it sit<br>tight and we'll get to those later I'd<br>now like to welcome to the uh Podium Dr<br>Ryan<br>Co um very good evening to everyone uh<br>so my name is Ryan Co and I'm<br>representing the University of Wu and<br>the cyber security lab so before I begin<br>I want to ask you a question which is<br>linked to what Martin has talked about<br>about updates so how many of you have<br>actually update your Java<br>regularly okay that's about one quarter<br>here and uh I'm going to tell you why<br>this is important okay but this is the<br>typical computer users what do we say to<br>the Java updates not today not today<br>okay and um as a result we have this uh<br>incident happening uh which is not<br>linked to cyber security but uh if you<br>recall in on April 15<br>2013 uh there was the Boston Marathon<br>bombing and because of that uh because<br>we're all interconnected and we seek<br>instant gratification on the web we all<br>want to see a piece of the action and as<br>a result the criminals online uh found a<br>way to push malware into your computers<br>and that's through giving you what you<br>want so they'll send you an email which<br>tells you that hey there's a video about<br>the Boston Marathon bombing and you can<br>click here and you can watch the video<br>so what's happening here is they give<br>you the video you know it didn't go to<br>to some site it gives you the video but<br>while the video is loading uh something<br>else is happening so do you recognize<br>what is<br>this anyone so some of you do I see some<br>people nodding the HS so this is a what<br>they call a black hole exploit kit uh<br>this is you know cyber security cyber<br>criminals have very fancy names and<br>cyber security researchers also have<br>fancy names for the things that they<br>found so as you can see this is a kind<br>of like a status report right like<br>Command Center and this is what criminal<br>see uh or rather the customers of the<br>criminal see and all all you do is uh so<br>if you recognize this uh this is<br>probably a language in the country a<br>very large country to the north of<br>everyone um and it says here you know uh<br>these are the number of computers that<br>that are visited uh that they have spam<br>and these are the people who have<br>clicked and these are the people who<br>have they have um successful fully<br>installed malware onto okay and as you<br>can see here uh windows are very much<br>affected there's a high number of people<br>affected in the US in this situation of<br>course it changes all the while and<br>another interesting thing that you see<br>here is the number of browsers the type<br>of browsers that are affected and also<br>the what is this this is these are the<br>plugins to your browsers okay so these<br>are the things that you install on top<br>of your browsers to access different<br>media and<br>this also signifies a rise of what we<br>call uh criminal<br>professionalism so you wouldn't be<br>surprised to see criminals actually<br>becoming more professional than the<br>service test that you you face with the<br>tele telecom companies so while you're<br>watching the video what happens here was<br>this they call it a<br>dispatcher and they go into uh yes and<br>no so they go into this uh so they check<br>where you're coming from they see if<br>you're coming from an IP Blacklist okay<br>what is this Black List The Black List<br>is um if you're a policeman or if you're<br>a an antivirus company we will not show<br>all this to you we will pretend to be<br>okay and they'll they'll give them a<br>blank page but if you're not a policeman<br>or if you're not an antivirus company<br>what they'll do is to give to you uh a<br>series of loads okay they call that<br>loads because they load stuff into your<br>computer while you're watching the video<br>and these are the different things that<br>are installed so this is Java version<br>1.6 if you don't have 1.6 they go to 1.7<br>and so on and so forth until they find<br>the right hole to put your put the thing<br>in okay and these are the relevant um<br>vulnerabilities and if Java is not not<br>the thing to load they will go into<br>Flash and then they'll go into some<br>other things like if you're using<br>Internet Explorer and so on some of the<br>things that they load onto you are quite<br>interesting for example they have things<br>that load onto your your computers uh<br>which can control your camera so they<br>can act as a CCTV for the criminals or<br>as a peping Tom too so these are called<br>Reds and the weird thing about this is<br>these are all freely available online so<br>uh it's kind of the trend that going on<br>and hence I am pessimistic about<br>it so let's look at the black list so<br>this is a this is a screen capture given<br>to me by one of our Advisory board<br>members for cyber security lab uh John<br>he works in TR micro and he told me that<br>you know they get blacklisted so they<br>can't really see so they have to create<br>fake computers that don't look like<br>antivirus company's website and then<br>they get to see that so you can see TR<br>micro kuski and CCH being uh blacklisted<br>by these criminals and how do you engage<br>them so behind the scenes right there<br>all you need is just a motivation you<br>either hate someone a lot or you are<br>very evil or you just want to have what<br>they call fun right so you must be<br>malicious and they have this site there<br>used to be this site it's now closed by<br>the FBI it's called Gangster bux.com and<br>they promise you quite a lot of good<br>service for example an individual<br>approach to everyone guaranteed weekly<br>payouts Round the Clock support you know<br>24/7 uh detailed statistics as shown<br>just now and the userfriendly software<br>you can't even get that with Microsoft<br>sometimes right yeah<br>so how do they how do they get paid you<br>know so these criminals they get paid<br>between $7 to $180 dollar per thousand<br>successful loads um but why are they<br>charging so so little is because they're<br>not only getting the loads but they're<br>using you as an excuse to get into the<br>people's computer and then they can<br>steal more stuff which are the the<br>fatter cow over there okay and the next<br>question that comes you know looking at<br>this then landscape and this kind of<br>criminal<br>organization what do what do we do when<br>we get hacked so how many of us know<br>what do we do so can if you know what to<br>do next can you raise your<br>hand yeah the first thing is Callet safe<br>right yeah but there's a lot of things<br>that that we can't do you know we feel<br>helpless after that you besides calling<br>that safe there's nothing else we can do<br>so the cyber security lab is coming<br>together to think about what's happening<br>in five years time the first problem is<br>we tend to depend on that geeky guy you<br>know or that it guy you know somewhere<br>across the room and that's a big problem<br>because we are not empowering ourselves<br>we're empowering that guy even more and<br>he could be evil right yeah the second<br>problem is there's a lack of effective<br>tools for everyone so our vision in the<br>cyber security lab is to create tools<br>which can Empower everyone just as easy<br>as it is to send an SMS message okay I'm<br>sure all of you know how to send the SMS<br>message Mo most of you at least 90% of<br>you so that's our goal our goal is to<br>hence our goal is to return control of<br>data to users through this kind of tools<br>okay and it's a new security mindset and<br>we like to call it a cyber civil defense<br>okay so um hence I'll let Moto yeah<br>return control of data to users and this<br>is what we do and our aim is to be uh at<br>least the top or if not one of the top<br>in Asia Pacific in 5 years time uh in<br>terms of cyber security research and<br>education so how do we Empower users the<br>first thing is you must know what<br>happened right if you are attack and you<br>do not know that you're attack then<br>there's nothing much you can do right<br>the next thing you need to do is to be<br>able to act on it you'll be surprised to<br>know that there's a lack of methods to<br>actually address this problem and the<br>third one is while you're doing all<br>these things you can still remain<br>private and safe online yeah so these<br>are the three main regions of uh scope<br>that we are looking at and hence this<br>three problems were divided into six uh<br>research goals by our lab the first one<br>is Provence which is what has happened<br>to your data you know is is it not out<br>in the cloud and who is touching it<br>right now uh the second one is how do we<br>Empower users how do we design around<br>the user you know the third one is how<br>do we see what's happening<br>visualization and economics you know um<br>we haven't started on this yet but we<br>are intending to work with uh our<br>colleagues from the management School in<br>the future when we have more cases what<br>what happen uh what is this trying to<br>address is if let's say we have $10<br>million as a company right I'm the CEO<br>how much am I going to invest in<br>security is it $1 or is it $10 million<br>you know or zero you know sometimes it's<br>zero right yeah because you have the<br>geeky guy there to help you do stuff<br>so this is a very interesting thing<br>because the cost is always a major push<br>for what to invest in and this would<br>then affect everything else and then we<br>also need to look at the hardware and<br>create data sets for people to do<br>experiments on but with respect to time<br>today I'm just going to focus on the top<br>two very briefly okay so let's start<br>with some<br>questions if no one wants to use our<br>inventions in the lab then no one wants<br>to use them right no one if no one<br>wants to use them we can't Empower them<br>and hence our hypothesis initially was<br>okay if you want to empower more users<br>we have to gain increased uptake okay<br>and how do we gain increased uptake<br>probably is through easy to use tools so<br>we surveyed the landscape and we found<br>oh we go back to square one at antivirus<br>and firewalls which is what everyone<br>knows here you see that's because they<br>were easy to use people know what they<br>do and what is the result of using them<br>and why is there such a thing um maybe<br>because there's a less number of clicks<br>maybe it's just number of Windows being<br>showing up so relating to that there<br>were some studies like the Amazon's one<br>click thing which increased the sales<br>you know you can buy a book with just<br>one click no keying in of credit card<br>information and also there's the web<br>design three page three click rule uh<br>where no page is should be three clicks<br>away so we looked at this thing and we<br>asked ourselves this question U is there<br>a relationship between the market share<br>and click count so one of my master<br>student and I we started to look at this<br>and we said Hey Okay since the antivirus<br>uh software are easy to use let's look<br>at each of them okay but which which<br>ones so we looked at this uh opswat<br>report which is a market report for<br>security software and they said okay<br>there top 16 so we installed them one by<br>one and it was a pain because it was<br>like a jealous girlfriend you know we<br>every time we install one we have to<br>remove the previous one because it says<br>please forget about the previous one<br>let's install this new one and then it<br>goes on and on 16 times you see that's<br>that's that's that's a big problem for<br>us but eventually we got some figures we<br>counted the number of clicks and we<br>tabulate them against the market share<br>so those working in Microsoft would be<br>happy to see this you know uh it's<br>16.3% and<br>um making it easier to visualize there's<br>some sort of a trend uh where if you<br>have a high market share you should have<br>some low average number of clicks and<br>vice versa uh this is of course there's<br>Kings inside there and scientifically we<br>need to do more experiments on it you<br>know so this is interesting so what what<br>does it mean it means that maybe to<br>empower more people we have to design<br>tools which you know in security that<br>are easy to understand and easy to use<br>okay and further study is needed on this<br>so we just covered one part of it and we<br>have to move on to the next one which is<br>ability to know and the ability to act<br>to give evidence to the law enforcement<br>agencies to uh catch the criminals so<br>some years ago<br>um this is a a situation in in the cloud<br>so you know we put our stuff in Gmail we<br>put our stuff in Google and we trust<br>them we trust that these guys will not<br>access our files but one of the<br>engineers the site reliability engineer<br>broke the trust so he went on to stop<br>teenage girls and their chats and their<br>pictures and he was caught but what's<br>more disturbing here is the fact that<br>it's unclear how widespread his abusers<br>were why is is it unclear that brings us<br>to another question are the tools<br>nowadays ready to track data activities<br>probably not you know the next<br>thing does anyone here knows how the uh<br>terrorists uh communicate before the<br>attacks okay so they use hot mail okay<br>oh wow well it's not not not something<br>very very very uh challenging right but<br>what's in what's so clever about this<br>hot mail thing is they did not send any<br>email to each other what they did was<br>they just created a draft so someone<br>signs writes a message but instead of<br>sending it he saves it as a draft signs<br>off then someone else access the account<br>from somewhere else in the world and<br>then it goes on and on and they had this<br>communication over the cloud but no<br>email was sent and no traffic was sent<br>so nothing was tracked and hence that<br>was a big problem right things were<br>going on and they all look so secure on<br>the front of the existing tools but many<br>loopholes were happening so what could<br>have detected this so we would like to<br>have this notion that uh this group of<br>tools which are called Provence tools<br>what has happened to your data tools<br>will be able to solve them so we went on<br>to develop them so uh our lab is<br>actually developing something and thanks<br>to the uh research trust contestable<br>fund by our search office we we were<br>able to build this uh thing called<br>progger a Providence logger okay uh it's<br>basically something that you install in<br>a kernel of a computer the deepest root<br>of the computer and it tracks stuff uh<br>tracks data activities from the lowest<br>possible Atomic actions create read<br>update and delete so every create read<br>update and delete is is track okay and<br>then you have very interesting things<br>for example in this video uh we so this<br>is created by my PhD student Mark uh and<br>we have this Alice and Bob so Bob is<br>trying to create a file which has the<br>staff bonus okay so Alice has zero doar<br>Bob has<br>$100 and Bob thinks that CLA is<br>hardworking so CLA has<br>$130 so while this is happening uh<br>proger is actually logging everything it<br>says that something is being created<br>something is being changed and so<br>on so Alice felt something was wrong so<br>she went on and she tried to access this<br>file that Bob has created okay so what<br>she did was she tried to access it and<br>permission was denied so she elevated<br>she had the admin access because she's<br>an administrator she went into Bob's<br>folder and accessed the folder so while<br>she was accessing the folder proger is<br>actually tracking them you say Alice is<br>opening and is closing Alice is opening<br>this file and she's trying to read the<br>content and so on so this is what proger<br>should do and this is what hot Mill<br>should have done you know during the<br>September 11 attack and we're trying to<br>address this so this is one of our<br>projects and the next thing is proger<br>not only empowers you with one machine<br>it maybe can empower the cloud so a guy<br>created a file on machine a and this<br>malicious Cloud administrator went in to<br>this machine a okay and then he copies<br>from machine a to machine B and he<br>renames it you know when you steal<br>something you would want to rename that<br>file right yeah so he renamed it as<br>random and and then he exits the next<br>thing he did was he locked into the<br>machine B you know because machine a is<br>where the the file was created right he<br>don't want to uh he doesn't want to<br>create activities there so he went to<br>machine B and sends an email out of of<br>the cloud that's it it's a very simple<br>scenario and proger was able to catch<br>that as well uh so this is not the death<br>star explosion uh this is the uh<br>basically an overview of what has<br>happened just now uh so this is a lock<br>but it's very hard to visualize so we<br>try to simplify it by pruning it from<br>the left to the right and this is not an<br>eyesight test so I'm going to zoom in<br>okay um so as you can see we have not<br>some notations here like files and what<br>we want to know is the purple line okay<br>and and also the different hosts so<br>starting from the left you can see that<br>the the program is actually accessing uh<br>so it's the file was created and there<br>was a console and the text editor being<br>open okay and and we zoom in to the to<br>the leakage track okay and the malicious<br>Insider copies the file to another<br>machine and when it was doing the secure<br>copy it was accessing the known host<br>which is a typical part of that<br>program and it travels across to another<br>host which is another machine and then<br>it was save random to random.<br>text and further down it was shown here<br>that this duplicate was sent out to the<br>cloud yeah and there was a data leakage<br>so this is what providence can do for<br>you so we have covered the ability to<br>know and the ability to use the tools<br>but there are many many more projects in<br>our cyber security<br>lab yep and this is my final slide uh<br>yes so what is the number one obstacle<br>to user<br>centricity<br>any<br>thing<br>tricks ease of use yeah that's one one<br>of it but I guess the the biggest one is<br>user empathy<br>right if we do all these things and the<br>users do not pick it up there's no no<br>way we can move forward so we we should<br>do some education uh positive ones okay<br>like social engineering in a positive<br>way what uh net safe is doing what<br>connect smart is doing or maybe even TV<br>shows like border security or woman in<br>blue you know when I'm eating dinner I<br>like to watch these shows and um why not<br>we do something for cyber security<br>enforcement agencies right and<br>understand what they do and what the<br>threats um there's also the of course<br>the mainstream curriculum and the<br>tertiary curriculum which is our master<br>of cyber security so here are some of<br>the lab's projects we have contributions<br>to local and uh Global efforts for<br>example this is a um a popular Cloud<br>tool and we have uh some contributions<br>to it but if you're interested you can<br>go to our website crow. org.nz to find<br>attention thank you Ryan I'm sorry for<br>ringing the bell<br>but we have to give everyone time uh so<br>thank you for that and I'd now like to<br>welcome Wayne rumbles as our final<br>evening so I get the last 10 minutes uh<br>I'm used to talking for minutes block so<br>I'll I'll try and get through it<br>um what you're seeing at the moment is<br>uh it's not quite real time because i' I<br>videoed it this afternoon but it's a<br>realtime attack so basically it's a<br>bunch of servers around the world that<br>have got vulnerabilities into them and<br>they're set up so they can watch people<br>um trying to attack<br>them um you can see there's a lot of<br>activity towards the<br>us so much of the law is reactionary it<br>creates a it is cre bettered to deal<br>with a problem and then kicks in when<br>that problem arises again in many<br>instance um the law kind of access this<br>ambulance at the bottom of the<br>cliff but the internet provides some<br>interesting um challenges for for the<br>law lawence L wrote an article back in<br>19 um in<br>1999 with a simple premise that<br>regulation of the internet can be<br>achieved through four regulatory m<br>modalities one of the uh one of these on<br>its own will not be a success and they<br>need to work<br>together what you're seeing now is<br>vulnerability so the first one was at<br>actual attacks this is vulnerabilities<br>in systems um New Zealand ends up about<br>number 50 something<br>usually um so there four modalities a<br>law and it does that through statute and<br>Regulation and case law um the market<br>access to technology its price point um<br>social norms as as we' already been<br>mentioned education like net safe or<br>self-regulation by private organizations<br>and the final is architecture and<br>code um through software or embedded<br>code in the hardware law can be and um<br>used to enhance all those other<br>modalities um in the market we can make<br>it mandatory that all Network equipment<br>is sold with full versions of um<br>security software Parliament could set a<br>policy that um and and and has through<br>its 2011 cyber security strategy to fund<br>education now come back we'll step back<br>to New Zealand prior to 2003 we had no<br>cyber security or was no cyber um law<br>around the criminal<br>activity um prior to this judges and<br>prosecutors had to be creative we had to<br>stretch the existing law to fit the<br>Cyber crimes for example Prosecuting a<br>Hecker who hacked a hacked the Telecom<br>telephone network using um you know one<br>of these um uh terms a blue box type of<br>freaking software called scavenger that<br>he downloaded off the internet um he<br>used that to Deford Telecom of hundreds<br>of thousands of dollars worth of um um<br>International um toll<br>calls so he had he had downloaded this<br>software um and used it to manipulate a<br>telephone exchange in Spain and that<br>sent a clear forward signal basically<br>telling the Telecom that there was no<br>one talking on that phone while he was<br>connecting multiple people together now<br>this was back in 2001 when it went to<br>went to<br>court with no specific hecking law in<br>place Mr mik was charged with using a<br>document to<br>defraud um the court had to stretch<br>stretch the meaning of document in the<br>Crimes Act to include the scavenger<br>software program that he had downloaded<br>off the<br>internet um which the court accepted and<br>thus gave an Avenue to prosecute the<br>hacker um who at least had gained a<br>monetary Advantage out of those<br>activities so even with trying to expand<br>and in some case manipulate the ex<br>existing law much of hacking activity<br>would fall outside these limited um<br>sections however in 2003 we made an<br>amendment to the Crimes Act enabling<br>hacking laws um or as Parliament named<br>them crimes involving computers to be<br>prosecuted and as of 2003 um it became a<br>criminal offense to gain access to a<br>computer network to copy modify or<br>authorization we created four new um<br>crimes and these offenses were accessing<br>a computer for um dishonest purpose um<br>and Carri carries a possible maximum<br>years the court have included um the<br>dishonest um as the dishonest purpose is<br>things like accessing an excal friend's<br>email for a year after their separation<br>so they he could watch and delete her<br>emails because he didn't um if he didn't<br>like what she was saying or what someone<br>who she was<br>contacting um accessing trade me with<br>stolen credit cards to buy a computer to<br>buy computer equipment foolishly he then<br>put them up for sale on tradem me as<br>well and the person he bought them off<br>even to to using an email um to uh to e<br>frontiera to redirect the shearing mil<br>shearing milking payment um that<br>normally went half to the farmer<br>normally half to the she milker the<br>email um suggested to fona that it all<br>goes to the Sher milker and that was<br>counted as accessing a computer system<br>purpose section 250<br>um creates a an offense for damaging and<br>interfering with the computer<br>system the courts got very nervous about<br>this because it<br>included um it<br>included uh deleting modifying or<br>impairing any data so how many of most<br>of you have probably deleted something<br>you didn't mean to even knowing that um<br>it may have caused um damage or it may<br>have caused lot or or or what so the<br>courts became very um nervous about this<br>one and when when the first case um came<br>before the courts the court took a<br>practical<br>approach um and said that deletion or or<br>modification needs some deliberate<br>criminal<br>action in terms of deletion there needed<br>to be more than just putting it in the<br>trash pin um clicking delete uh that<br>they needed to show that someone took<br>some extra steps to stop people being<br>able to recover that that that<br>material the third um offense although<br>no one's been charged under this as far<br>as I know um is making selling<br>Distributing possessing um software for<br>committing a crime so basically hacker<br>software um uh putting that up onto onto<br>a site Distributing that proposing that<br>um people can use that is an offense<br>under the Crimes<br>Act and finally the last one is exess in<br>a computer system without authorization<br>you don't have to do any damage you<br>don't have to have have just accessing<br>enough and um our courts have<br>interpreted this very very widely to<br>include even uh an unfortunate young<br>chap who was um or he was on Parole and<br>he went along to the police station and<br>he was<br>sitting waiting waiting to see one of<br>the officers got a bit bored so he<br>reached across the count<br>and turned the computer around clicked<br>the mouse he didn't couldn't go any<br>further um because there was a password<br>screen that came up so it was just a<br>splash screen um and he was Pro he was<br>charged um with accessing a computer<br>without authorization so just by<br>clicking the<br>Mouse<br>um the judge didn't gave him you know<br>basically uh no conviction um L go home<br>um but the police um U took that took<br>that<br>forward um also the another quick case<br>was a priest using an ATM machine to<br>transfer money from the church to his<br>personal account so he could go gambling<br>at casino um that was also considered<br>accessing a computer system without um<br>without<br>authorization this this section would<br>also include so-called um white hack um<br>white hat hacking um where a person<br>claims that they're only demonstrating<br>the vulnerabilities in a system and even<br>if they revealed it um to the<br>organization concerned could be<br>prosecuted under that so as you can see<br>the the courts have taken a wide<br>interpretation of these sections so why<br>aren't our courts flooded with these<br>cases well there's a few<br>problems um one users are hard to find<br>often they appear to be<br>anonymous although you there are ways to<br>reveal um um who their<br>identity they don't have to be in the<br>same jurisdiction they can be across the<br>globe and um one of our own um famous<br>hackers Owen Walker from<br>fer he used servers throughout Malaysia<br>to attack uh the<br>us so you don't even have to be um the<br>the actual computers using to attack<br>don't even have to be in the same<br>jurisdiction as as the as the user you<br>can have multiple victims and as um some<br>of the cases um we've already seen um is<br>the the victims can be distributed and<br>it's hard um for law enforcement to um<br>to bring that together the volatility of<br>the evidence um as as as um Ryan was<br>showing in in that list of the computer<br>system is changing constantly and our<br>courts and and laws of evidence want to<br>want to be proved that this that the EV<br>that the material they given was EX the<br>same as that at times of the crime and<br>because digital evidence is so volatile<br>and changeable um this causes a problem<br>for for our<br>courts<br>encryption strong encryption is<br>unbreakable in a in a sense for for a<br>time to get to<br>court and um one case in child<br>pornography downloading child<br>pornography he had 8 gigabytes of of<br>material encrypted he forgot the<br>encryption key um so therefore um the<br>court were unable to prosecute um that<br>person for that for that material<br>because it was encrypted and there was<br>no way of accessing<br>that and reporting of crimes as um<br>Martin mentioned there is there's a<br>there's some reporting through the a but<br>that's just the tip of the iceberg a lot<br>of people don't if you're if you're a<br>victim of one of those romance um scams<br>uh you might not you might feel twice uh<br>think twice about it um talking to to<br>the<br>police and Commercial sensitivity if I'm<br>kidding really all right um can I just<br>things one of the other issues in terms<br>is not only getting to court it is um<br>facing in New Zealand we have um huge<br>discretion on when to prosecute and when<br>to not if you turn up to a police<br>station um and say I think my computer's<br>been hacked the most likely um response<br>you will get is thank you good night um<br>now this is not because um our police uh<br>don't necessarily care about that it is<br>resources if you're a police officer<br>you're faced with um property real<br>property crime that you can see and feel<br>um you're faced with um violence and um<br>and uh uh perhaps uh domestic abuse then<br>something that you can't even see you<br>can't understand um it's difficult to<br>find out who the perpetrator is is going<br>to be pushed down in terms of the um<br>priorities I believe we're at least a<br>generation away from from from changing<br>this we need a new generation of um<br>lawyers and we've been we've been<br>teaching Cyber Law for about eight years<br>at our law law faculty um ockland does<br>it as well so gradually those lawyers<br>with a little bit of knowledge are are<br>moving out we need a new generation of<br>police that are digital natives that<br>understand what people are talking about<br>and it takes a little bit longer but<br>it's a new generation of Judges as well<br>um to be able to actually grasp what's<br>going on here now I was going to talk<br>about international law but was through<br>that some areas of international Co<br>cooperation work quite well in the in<br>the cyber security this is Owen Walker<br>um he was came to the attention of the<br>FBI when he crashed the server at the<br>Pennsylvanian University<br>um uh on behalf of a of a fellow student<br>who um felt AG<br>grieved now<br>he also had um been hacking into um the<br>Netherlands so the first hour police<br>found out about him was when the FBI<br>turned up and the Netherlands police<br>knocked on their door said um Mr Owen<br>Walker um has been doing has been doing<br>these<br>activities now all three jurisdiction<br>had jurisdictions criminal he had<br>committed a crime in in the US he<br>committed a crime in in the Netherlands<br>he committed well probably in the in<br>Malaysia as well um and he committed<br>crime here in New Zealand um through<br>International cor operation they decided<br>his best place for him to be tried was<br>in New Zealand and the information from<br>the FBI was handed over to the New<br>Zealand Police so worked quite well<br>doesn't always work that way um Mr<br>do uh we're some some years down in<br>terms of trying to extradite him um<br>according to the US he is um a a severe<br>cyber criminal even though his copyright<br>preachers wouldn't be a criminal act in<br>New Zealand um but this's other one here<br>is um Gary McKinnon I will stop in a<br>minute um uh he hacked 94 computers in<br>the US from the UK uh he was he was<br>looking for he believed in a UFO coverup<br>that um the US government was was hiding<br>a UFO that they had they had discovered<br>and he deleted files from the US Army<br>computers um and um he deleted Navy<br>weapons logs from a naval base computer<br>system which shut down um the the the<br>Navy base and this was um not long after<br>September the 11th um the estimated cost<br>of that were around<br>$700,000 us extr extradition claim began<br>with the UK by the US in 2005 and it was<br>not until<br>2012 that the um Home Secretary decided<br>that sending um sending U Mr McKinnon to<br>the US would for a lengthy prison<br>sentence would likely cause him harm um<br>and um he was he is not to be exited but<br>UK<br>one um just leave that up there um in<br>you I feel so mean cutting down<br>everyone's time but we have run out of<br>time um we run over time but we do have<br>um some time for questions so<br>uh and I've just been asked to mention<br>that tonight's lecture will be loaded on<br>iTunes uh the University of w site<br>within two weeks so if you want to look<br>at it then uh that will be there um<br>meanwhile I'm terrified and I'm going to<br>go home and back up all my files and I'm<br>never going to watch a video online<br>again um but we do have some time for<br>questions and there's some microphones<br>in the uh audience were circulating so<br>if you have any questions just raise<br>your hand or stand up and somebody can<br>bring a microphone to you and you could<br>address your question either to any of<br>the individual speakers or to them as a<br>whole could I ask um the cyber security<br>experts on the panel whether they<br>themselves use internet banking with<br>full<br>confidence there's a microphone there<br>for<br>you uh<br>yes yes I do uh not only do I use the uh<br>internet banking I also use the app on<br>my phone um but that may be because I'm<br>Ryan I I used that but I enable this<br>feature called the multiactor<br>authentication uh that would help me to<br>know whether someone else has accessed<br>my bank account without me knowing it uh<br>if I access my bank account I'll get an<br>SMS which gives me another password to<br>lock in yeah so that's what I do but I<br>well so the future as I said is our<br>world's only going to get more digital<br>our assets are becoming more virtual um<br>and and more and more of information<br>about us will be harvested and analyzed<br>online the law plays a vital role but<br>it's not that whole answer<br>um<br>the law there will be new Cyber specific<br>laws and um already we've already<br>mentioned the harmful digital<br>Communications bill which is um going<br>through its process at the moment<br>existing law will be further developed<br>and the Privacy Act is one that is is<br>has been targeted um law will be used to<br>strengthen the other modalities of<br>regulation on on on the<br>internet technology and the stuff that<br>Ryan's doing um will get more<br>sophisticated and we'll get more secure<br>um software but so will the Cyber<br>criminals the social norms will change<br>slowly through education self-regulation<br>and new online norms and um especially<br>and I predict in terms of<br>privacy if I had another hour we could<br>talk about um the Google case in terms<br>of privacy but um also the market the<br>market through customer devant policy<br>directive and legislation threatened or<br>real um and and this I believe in in the<br>area of cloud computing especially um<br>many jurisdictions are looking at how<br>can we deal with with the security of<br>cloud computing as we move both our<br>commercial and our personal assets into<br>the into the cloud but there's one thing<br>missing and that's you every one of<br>you and one thing if I can ple from um<br>from tonight is if you do get hacked if<br>a scam happens go to the orb report it<br>it's the only way that we're going to<br>get resources into um the police um and<br>into into into the legal Arena<br>governments react because the public<br>react governments if if they can't see<br>it it's not really an election issue<br>unless it's brought to their attention<br>so the one thing remember the site and<br>if you don't remember the site go net<br>safe and you'll have a link on it um and<br>cheers thank you Wayne I'd now like to<br>invite back to the stage the deputy Vice<br>evening um thank you very much uh Brenda<br>for facilitating this evening although I<br>think you can be more tough with your<br>chair of department or chair of school<br>um I'm sure that and I also want to<br>thank um Ryan Wayne and Martin for your<br>presentations in an area that continues<br>uh to increase in global significance<br>and impact on our daily lives to our<br>guests in the audience thank you for<br>attending and for your contributions<br>this evening and I'd like to take the<br>opportunity to remind you of next week's<br>lecture That's Entertainment what does<br>the future of viewing look like many of<br>us grew up with the 6 PM some of us<br>don't get to see it any more news um as<br>our main intake of news for for the day<br>now people getting information anywhere<br>anytime and any format just enough just<br>just now and just for me this combined<br>with the rise of celebrity culture has<br>completely changed the entertainment<br>landscape what will be the future of<br>entertainment be will movie theaters<br>survive will we ever be free from<br>celebrities our speakers next week<br>include uh faculty of arts and social<br>science screen and media associate<br>professor Jeff uh Leland author Julie<br>Thomas and wirer Senior producer Megan<br>wheen and the evening will be<br>facilitated by University of wot alumnus<br>TV presenter Jesse<br>malagan thank you again for coming I'd<br>like to encourage you to continue uh<br>mingling and pick up a brochure for the<br>rest of the lecture series uh and more<br>information please feel free to stay for<br>a drink at the Opus bar and if tonight's<br>lectures has inspired you to enroll in<br>uh Masters cyber security or Wayne's um<br>Cyber Law I encourage you to do so thank<br>you very<br>much the University of waor where the<br>world is<br>going</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
