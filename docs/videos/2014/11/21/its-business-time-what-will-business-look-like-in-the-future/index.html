microphones<br>if you could please join me in welcoming<br>hello everybody thank you<br>um<br>it's nice to be here Max such<br>distinguished speakers and guests so I<br>hope I can offer something interesting<br>for you guys tonight<br>um so I'm Steve Hood<br>previously I'm the owner of a<br>specialized online retail platform<br>selling men's streetwear and apparel to<br>the age groups between 16 and 35 but<br>it's not exclusive to that so if the<br>younger people here or older people here<br>want to buy something off me they're<br>welcome to do that<br>um<br>I guess in terms of future business what<br>my<br>um my business is all about is I'm not<br>limited geographically<br>um hence that it's situated out in<br>Raglan so so how does it work<br>um<br>it's located out in Raglan I've got a<br>office out there with a warehouse with<br>all the stock and all the clothing much<br>like uh your local bricks and mortar<br>store except all my stock is just<br>packages as it comes sitting on shelves<br>um we've got a photography studio there<br>with with all the setup and the in the<br>appropriate lighting and equipment and<br>we have a model and a photographer turn<br>up once or twice a week and we shoot all<br>the new products on the model and also<br>close-up detail shots and um and then we<br>use that which we then put online onto<br>the shop we've got a few office staff<br>but I guess because it's online and a<br>lot of it's automated we don't need as<br>many staff or physical staff dealing<br>with the customers<br>uh like a bricks and mortar store<br>um and from there we do all the customer<br>service all the dispatch the marketing<br>the product management product<br>management and those kinds of things<br>um a courier van comes past five o'clock<br>each day we have all our orders sitting<br>there waiting to go and we ship<br>guaranteed overnight anywhere in New<br>Zealand and express all across the world<br>tracked and it's it's really quite fast<br>it can get us to Australia and overnight<br>it can get to Singapore in three days it<br>can get to London in three days and the<br>customer can have it so it's it's really<br>quite amazing that it can get there that<br>quick<br>um<br>why have I ended up in Raglan or what's<br>a little bit of a background to lead me<br>to this as you heard before I used to<br>well I've been in sales for clothing in<br>both New Zealand selling uh Dickies<br>Clothing which is both Workwear and<br>streetwear depending on what you do<br>um<br>I've also been in clothing production<br>running at the local production plant<br>for the manufacturer of Adidas<br>sportswear in Auckland for the rest of<br>New Zealand<br>um<br>and I was also the UK sales manager for<br>Quicksilver clothing and their surfing<br>products their wetsuits and sunglasses<br>and watches and that kind of thing over<br>in in Cornwall down in the bottom of<br>England there<br>and how I came to find out about an<br>online store<br>um was that England generally paves the<br>way for online shopping in the world<br>um I suppose they've got so many<br>countries feeding into to their<br>epicenter<br>and I used to go to these online stores<br>and sell my product to them so I'd hold<br>up some sunnies or a wetsuit or a range<br>of clothing and hopefully they bought it<br>and there<br>um their warehouses were ginormous the<br>the operations were just phenomenal like<br>football field couple football field<br>size just to the roof of stock and and<br>I'm looking at this and I've done my my<br>three to almost four years in England<br>and I thought I can do this in New<br>Zealand and I can more importantly do it<br>in Raglan and I can more importantly<br>probably live very close to the surf in<br>Raglan and be able to create a business<br>and regular is quite small there's not<br>many um viable jobs out there that might<br>pay the salary I was looking for so I<br>thought I'd have a go at starting<br>and the good thing is is that I can do<br>it I don't have to be in Auckland I've<br>lived in Auckland doing jobs up there<br>um the cast both myself and the<br>customers are not affected by the<br>location of my business and I suppose<br>that's obviously down to the to the<br>internet<br>um<br>the other question is yes it's a nice<br>idea but why would it work in New<br>Zealand and it works in New Zealand<br>because we're so so much behind so much<br>further behind England Australia<br>USA which shops like mine that there was<br>a clear Gap in the market so that was<br>one that was that made sense there's<br>also a trend of people shopping online<br>now and the convenience of shopping<br>online is you can do it at home while<br>you're watching depending on who you are<br>Coronation Street Downtown Abbey or Game<br>of Thrones or whatever so you don't even<br>have to leave the house and you can have<br>some new product arrive the next day<br>um<br>a few stats for you got for you for you<br>guys about online shopping in New<br>Zealand 87 of New Zealand<br>households have live broadband<br>I actually thought it might have been a<br>bit higher<br>um<br>but I guess not everyone needs to be<br>connected to the internet and our lives<br>would be probably be a lot simpler if we<br>didn't have to deal with things<br>associated with the internet<br>um<br>71 percent of<br>new zealanders age between 25 and 34<br>shop online so it's a it's a quite quite<br>a substantial amount and it makes me<br>think that why not Target these people<br>um<br>there's still a high rate in the higher<br>age brackets 45 to 54 there's still 58<br>of those people shop online it doesn't<br>have to be clothing retail it can be<br>books it can be homewares it can be<br>anything<br>and even half of half of the new<br>zealanders age between 55 and 64 are<br>New Zealand online sales are growing by<br>15 15 each year<br>so it's compounding it's quite a<br>hopefully I can exploit that<br>New Zealand<br>only six percent of all New Zealand's<br>retail sales are online whereas in the<br>UK there's it's over over 10 percent so<br>there's a there's a bit of catching up<br>to do apparently we're eight years<br>behind the UK and our online shopping<br>sort of situation<br>but an interesting fact is that 19 out<br>of every 20 purchases in New Zealand in<br>the retail sector are still made at<br>bricks and mortar stores so despite what<br>you hear on the news a lot of the time<br>even fear go and that kind of thing I<br>know they heard there was something on<br>there last week about online shopping a<br>lot of people still utilize shopping<br>online<br>um<br>so<br>the next question is is that we've got<br>the business set up I'm in Raglan it's<br>great I've got<br>a lot of stock there which is scary<br>because you have to pay for it and then<br>then you have to sell it unfortunately<br>so the question is how do you how do we<br>get these sales<br>and<br>there's many forms many many forms that<br>like your social media that a lot of us<br>like and a lot of us loathe<br>uh we have Google so if you're looking<br>around Google and you type in<br>something that happens to be relevant to<br>my to my website in this case it's this<br>brand up here called Zane rope<br>if you were looking for some Zane Road<br>pants you'd type Zane robe and I've paid<br>for that that ad to come up and that's<br>why Google's so rich because a lot of<br>people pay for that to happen to drive<br>traffic to these stores<br>uh you have Facebook which you all know<br>and these are just the more um casual<br>approach to showing your customers what<br>you generally do and and the look and<br>feel of your store<br>and so that's flashing up from a few<br>trips a bit of our product<br>we uh we have a database of every every<br>person that buys something we we keep<br>their details we have permission of<br>course and we can email them keep them<br>updated there's social influences<br>um there's a group of kids called the<br>the just uni kids who do videos across<br>the internet and they've got a massive<br>following just because it's it's<br>interesting on Facebook so we'll use<br>them to talk about us<br>um you have digital Partnerships so we<br>have a partnership with the the rhythm<br>of vines Festival<br>um down in in Gisborne and as you can<br>see there's one of our ads across there<br>this social social site<br>and then we've got radio and and other<br>things like that just to show you the<br>inner workings under the hood if you<br>with with Google gives you this great<br>tool where you can actually see what<br>happens<br>um pretty much you know everything about<br>everyone that comes to your website<br>except for their name and obviously who<br>they are so right now this is live this<br>is what's happening I've got 13 people<br>walking around my store<br>and you can see what they're looking at<br>here<br>and you can see how many people are how<br>many people are there and uh and it's<br>quite it can suck up a lot of time<br>watching hope it hoping that though you<br>can see when they're at the checkout you<br>can see when they leave the checkout you<br>can see when they come back<br>so that's really really helpful and we<br>can find out other stuff like where are<br>and I'll finish there but I'll just show<br>you some countries about the type of<br>countries I'm how far away the countries<br>are that I'm selling to<br>so this is over a month<br>we have had visits from all of these<br>countries<br>Spain Russia Malaysia Belgium Finland<br>Greece Pakistan<br>I haven't seen anything to Pakistan but<br>someone is looking<br>so<br>that's um that's the hopefully in a bit<br>of a bit of an insight into the future<br>of of an online shop and the way we do<br>business and how I'm not restricted to<br>to being in a big city center and<br>working traditional nine to five hours<br>thanks<br>thank you Steve look I know you've<br>probably got some great questions<br>Brewing there for him but please hold<br>them to the to the end I found it very<br>inspirational because I do a little bit<br>of online shopping myself but it was<br>great to hear some of the statistics in<br>terms of how watch age groups are<br>actually doing the online shopping<br>now without further Ado I'd like to<br>invite Chris Inslee up to speak about<br>just check the<br>technology uh<br>Steve said to me that he's into surfing<br>and you heard that I'm from the final<br>world Nazi Pro so we've got this amazing<br>Coastline and he said yeah and I've<br>figured out that I want to go surfing<br>there but I was told that I had to take<br>two boxes of steinies with me when I go<br>around there to get access to the land<br>to go surfing<br>just briefly I'd like to just translate<br>I greet you all as as either teachers<br>lecturers here at the the University of<br>waikato and maybe some of you are<br>students so I greet you as well<br>um but I also speak seen special<br>greeting to any of you that may be from<br>here from tynwy but also and finally a<br>greeting from our chairman uh Dr<br>abhirard Who is a friend of Royce and so<br>I seen to Roy a greeting from our from<br>our chairman Uncle happy<br>now I've been told that I've got 20<br>minutes I've got about 20 slides and<br>I've said I will be I won't go any over<br>20 20 minutes so I'm going to launch<br>straight into it a little bit of a<br>different kind of um theme from what<br>um I also got told by Nicola that I had<br>20 minutes and she told me actually what<br>I had to talk about it what I couldn't<br>talk about and I said yeah okay I'll<br>talk about those things Nicola but I'm<br>also going to talk about some other<br>things so that I want to share with you<br>some practical examples of some of the<br>stuff that I've been involved in so<br>these are the kind of things that we we<br>jointly agree that I want to talk about<br>it's to share with you some of the<br>things that are going on in the Maori<br>economy and related to that this issue<br>about leadership<br>um that's happening across the Maori<br>economy and then talk about some of the<br>work that I'm involved in this space of<br>sustainability and and especially<br>climate change internationally and<br>domestically here in New Zealand and I<br>will be provocative too there's some<br>stuff that I'm going to share with you<br>that's pretty provocative now this is<br>the stuff here that Nicola told me that<br>I wouldn't spend too much time on so I<br>won't but I want to actually share with<br>you some practical examples I think of<br>some of the maybe the theoretical things<br>that we live in and talk about in<br>institutions like this but we actually<br>show you some of the how these things<br>that I'm involved in we're actually<br>rolling out on the ground and they go<br>from very big things to very very small<br>community things but I think they're all<br>important<br>um so this this thing about leadership<br>so Nicholas said have a talk about<br>what's going on in leadership in in uh<br>in the Maori economy and so I actually<br>kind of like you know there's all these<br>theoretical models I reckon that this<br>guy has got some good thinking about how<br>to define leadership this guy you know<br>Colin Powell and one of the things that<br>you know he's he's got 14 lessons the<br>first one of those lessons is that if<br>you've got to Be an Effective leader<br>you've got to be prepared to piss people<br>off and if you're not prepared to do<br>that you're really going to be quite an<br>ineffective leader because according to<br>this guy and I believe he's right that<br>sometimes in organizations the Army's no<br>different if you're not an effective<br>leader and if you're not prepared to<br>actually take people to task when they<br>need to be you're not going to be an<br>effective leader so it's kind of one of<br>the themes that I that I want to sort of<br>roll through tonight with you another<br>one is about building smart teams and<br>looking for really really strong capable<br>people and bringing those people around<br>you and this is certainly something that<br>we as Maori have really clicked and it's<br>growing out people through institutions<br>like waikato and in fact the best<br>universities across the world<br>um and and lastly this kind of principle<br>and I want to try and illustrate these<br>principles in some practical examples<br>according to this guy and I agree with<br>him the greatest leaders are people that<br>can simplify things they can boil down<br>all the technical jargon all the<br>buzzwords and all the rest of it and and<br>paint a really really clear simple<br>picture the way forward that people<br>believe in and they get behind and<br>follow and one of the guys I'm going to<br>kind of use to paint that picture is<br>Uncle upy<br>um shortly what's going on in the Maori<br>economy why I want to actually share<br>this with you it's quite important<br>because it's quite significant not just<br>to Maori but to New Zealand here's a<br>piece of work that was done by Dr<br>garnish Nana from Bill a couple of three<br>three years ago and he started to put<br>some numbers around what was happening<br>in the Maori economy and effectively<br>what he concluded is it's big 37 billion<br>dollars and it's concentrated in the<br>primary sectors where we we own<br>collectively around half half the<br>fishing industry in New Zealand is owned<br>by Maori<br>um around 30 to 40 percent and and<br>through a number of different different<br>streams in farming is owned by Maori in<br>forestry<br>increasingly 30 to 40 and it'll just<br>keep growing in time so these primary<br>sectors have a huge if you're like Maori<br>um ownership and influence which is<br>important to understand going forward<br>uh here's here's something to to also<br>understand<br>I actually did these numbers not Ganesh<br>so garnish actually<br>um what he did was he measured the Maori<br>economy then he measured the the<br>non-maori economy and that's what these<br>grief these graphs talk about there's<br>the 37 billion dollars here's the<br>non-maori economy at this level here but<br>the real important thing I think the<br>lesson in terms of thinking about the<br>future is if you do the numbers and<br>understand do the maths and how how<br>quickly these these these two if you<br>like<br>um separate economies and we think of<br>them as separate economies are growing<br>this one is growing at about 15 to 70 17<br>percent year on year Maori economy uh<br>this one the the rest of the economy is<br>growing about three or four percent if<br>you roll those numbers forward so if<br>they continue to grow at that rate what<br>might the future look like and that's<br>what this graph here paints a picture of<br>if they continue to grow at that rate<br>um by about<br>you know somewhere around about there<br>the Maori economy will be about the same<br>size as the non-maorian economy<br>and that's just on the basis of what's<br>good what we see going on around us at<br>the moment I guess the real challenge is<br>can the Maori economy continue to grow<br>at its current rate<br>and I've got some examples of companies<br>that I'm directly involved in one of<br>which is growing at more than 17<br>year-on-year at around 20 so the answer<br>that to that I have is that yes it's<br>growing fast and it'll become a major<br>component of the New Zealand economy<br>going forward and as Maori we think<br>differently around how we run our<br>businesses we we think of them as<br>long-term businesses 100 years and more<br>that's the same sustainability if you<br>like driver<br>climate change I want to sort of turn it<br>and the relationship between climate<br>change and sustainability well it you<br>know I think for everyone in the room<br>you'll agree there is a there is a<br>Common Thread there as ewe we've been<br>having a major discussion with the<br>government of New Zealand around what we<br>think good policy might look like for<br>New Zealand and certainly in terms of<br>our interest is Maori uh here's our<br>chairman this great leader this is Uncle<br>appy here talking with naida glavish and<br>one of the other hats that I wear is I'm<br>a member of the New Zealand negotiating<br>team out there in the United Nations<br>trying to to actually get good policy<br>internationally my job is Uncle happy<br>our chairman tells me is to interpret<br>that bring it home and tell all the UE<br>what that actually what happened out<br>there in the International Space and<br>what it means for us so I've been a<br>member of that negotiating team for a<br>number of years these are the drivers<br>that I talk about our long-term<br>commitment intergenerational it's<br>different from from non-maori businesses<br>and and again I can attest to that for<br>some of the other work that I'm involved<br>in but we're not just interested in the<br>hardcore numbers like the npv and the<br>return on investment we're interested<br>very much so in how any investment might<br>grow our people at home<br>uh might take care of the environment<br>and ultimately if we're doing these<br>things right we will we'll we will grow<br>our identity as Maori our culture and<br>that's the way we think about about<br>um a sustainability it's an integrated<br>way of thinking about things it's a<br>holistic way of thinking about things<br>and it's a long-term way of thinking<br>about things<br>um<br>some of you this is this is something<br>that that ewe leadership group under<br>Uncle up you have been basically at<br>loggerheads with the New Zealand<br>government<br>for the last five or so years and this<br>is really what it's all about I don't<br>want to get into the detail but some of<br>you might be intimate with the detail<br>the primary instrument that New Zealand<br>has as a policy instrument in Wellington<br>is a price on carbon price on emissions<br>now because of some things that the<br>government did this is where it's going<br>to get a bit controversial here and<br>provocative<br>the government did some things in<br>Wellington<br>and I won't go into all of the detail<br>happy to talk through the detail if<br>anyone wants to know but they did the<br>wrong things and this is what happened<br>to the price of carbon it collapsed it<br>collapsed down to almost an<br>embarrassingly almost zero point like<br>Australia and when that happened because<br>here we are big in The primary sector it<br>cost ewe 600 million dollars but then it<br>got worse you know I think then it got<br>worse<br>here's some research This is highly<br>controversial<br>here's some research that Erie<br>leadership group have just commissioned<br>through a chief Economist that's the<br>advisor to treasury on on climate change<br>policy and we asked the we asked this<br>this Chief Economist to do some numbers<br>for us and said what's going on out<br>there by the big polluters in terms of<br>this collapse in this carbon crisis you<br>can see it follows the same basic line<br>and and uh mindful of time but all I<br>want to say to you and I'm happy to go<br>through the detail over this last three<br>year period the government have stood by<br>and allowed the polluters in New Zealand<br>the energy companies to price gouge when<br>every single one of us goes to the<br>petrol pump for every liter of petrol<br>and Diesel that's been sold every unit<br>of electricity that's been purchased in<br>the last three years we've all been<br>price gouged by the polluters in this<br>country to the tune of 1.4 billion<br>dollars so this is a big discussion<br>substantive discussion that ee leaders<br>are having with John key right now in<br>the lead-up to the election<br>I move on<br>um we leaders went to the government at<br>the end of last year and said you need<br>to fix this problem about this price on<br>carbon because people are leaving the<br>emissions trading system and we put a<br>proposal to them fix it to 15 bucks<br>through our chairman here and if they<br>did that this would create a hundred<br>thousand would attract the necessary<br>investment to plant a hundred thousand<br>hectares of New Forest per year for 10<br>years double the size of the New Zealand<br>Forest industry<br>oops<br>help<br>um it would restore 400 of the 600<br>million dollars that were lost it would<br>attract 800 million dollars no cost to<br>the taxpayer<br>uh that's all this was all about and<br>done by independent economists at<br>infametrics would create fifty thousand<br>new jobs across the economy new and<br>permanent jobs<br>targeting the 1.2 million hectares of<br>Mali land and address some of the worst<br>soil erosion in the world the government<br>rejected it this is a no-brainer but<br>they rejected it for political reasons<br>I'm going to move on some of the<br>sustainability projects that uh that I'm<br>involved in directly<br>here's one this is the business I<br>mentioned to you that's growing at 20 a<br>year it's the only hundred percent uh in<br>kawaro uh only 100 Mario and geothermal<br>assets company last 10 years has grown<br>year on year at 20 percent Amazing Story<br>this<br>and so however one of the things that I<br>know sitting on the board of that<br>organization it is it does have some<br>vulnerabilities and that is in order to<br>sustain that growth the risk it has we<br>sell energy to the pulp Mills in kodo if<br>anything happened to those pop Mills our<br>business is at threat under threat so<br>we've been looking at ways to diversify<br>that business into a whole lot of other<br>smart things and engage some of the best<br>thinkers in the world to help us on that<br>Journey I'll come to that shortly<br>uh here's another project so this is a<br>kind of a smaller project a community<br>project that we've got in the Eastern<br>Bay of Plenty and it's about the rising<br>cost of energy uh it's going like that<br>small communities Maori rural<br>communities fixed incomes so if the<br>price of Petra energy goes up fixed<br>incomes small communities rural<br>communities feel that that problem the<br>worst so we've been trying to find a way<br>to actually create Renewable<br>community-owned Energy company and we're<br>getting there we started doing a few<br>things like this<br>and now we've moved on to actually this<br>is some of our drivers cheap energy for<br>the whanau energy security create jobs<br>and we had this done this Amazing<br>Project we got all these Bright Young<br>Minds from the not White Castle<br>University sorry uh Roy Auckland<br>University Canterbury University<br>Auckland Institute of Technology fourth<br>year engineering students to come and<br>work with us and try and solve this<br>problem awesome exercise these are these<br>kids uh on our marai and we picked the<br>top three<br>and uh here's the two top top um uh<br>uh uh proposals that we're now working<br>through another process with some really<br>really full-time Engineers to turn those<br>things into a reality<br>uh we've got Chapman Tripp working with<br>us to set up these new companies that<br>are owned by our community here's the<br>energy project in here won't go through<br>all the detail we've got a land-based<br>aquaculture project out the site here<br>that's happening through my work in Nazi<br>Pro that project is moving along and<br>we're looking to do the greenhouse<br>development thing there as well that's<br>in a small community in the Eastern Bay<br>of Plenty call of mile<br>and we've got the strategy of finding<br>the best people<br>here's the best people that we've got in<br>this country<br>that are actually working with us along<br>with Chapman Tripp to actually make this<br>thing real<br>this stuff is you you can if you want to<br>know any more about this is the stuff<br>you guys can get it but they are the<br>best people in this country with<br>International experience working<br>alongside our commercial advisors from<br>Chapman trip on our project to create<br>this renewable energy business that we<br>own<br>here's the um the the the work that I<br>mentioned earlier on our geothermal<br>assets company uh it's about how do we<br>actually make that that company sustain<br>itself over the long term and protect it<br>from anything that might happen to the<br>wood industry in Koto so this initiative<br>is around how do we use steam energy to<br>create high value food<br>um<br>and I've been for the last two years<br>tripping around through Europe through<br>London uh through Switzerland France<br>Germany uh there's another country in<br>there somewhere uh and look visiting the<br>best food Innovation institutes across<br>Europe<br>with a view to finding the best people<br>the best Technologies and bringing these<br>people home to New Zealand to work with<br>us on some of these projects next week<br>we will contract here<br>uh The wackeningen Institute out of the<br>Netherlands to bring their team of<br>experts around<br>Greenhouse development<br>to work with us for four months to build<br>the business Case by Christmas we'll<br>have the business case and as our<br>chairman Uncle happy says once you've<br>got the business case call a Hui bring<br>us all together these are the Chiefs of<br>of ewe and five of these guys<br>collectively they sit over the top of a<br>balance sheet around 500 million dollars<br>looking to invest in in this particular<br>project that's stage one uh stage two is<br>how do we actually might use the output<br>from this whether it's flowers or food<br>or whatever and feed those into<br>subsequent processes to get ourselves<br>from being basically at the low value<br>end of this value chain to the very very<br>high end of this value chain into things<br>like nutraceuticals and so these are all<br>of the people that have kind of mapped<br>out already and I'm talking to it right<br>now around them bringing their teams to<br>work with us in Koto and and with other<br>Maori around the country off the back of<br>this initial piece of work over the next<br>four months we're really wrapped these<br>are some of the best thinkers in the<br>world are going to come and sit down<br>with us and bring their knowledge and<br>share that with us to to grow that<br>business even further and continue that<br>growth of 20 year-on-year-old growth<br>it's pretty cool<br>and as part of that through my tripping<br>around through these these countries<br>through Europe here's the people that<br>we're talking to currently these are<br>these institutes incredible institutes<br>is mind-boggling and quite scary<br>actually some of the research that that<br>you see some of these people doing sort<br>of Frankenstein stuff<br>you know that seriously you see these<br>this amazing woman in Germany talking<br>about extending the lifespan of worms<br>four times<br>and she said oh and we can even reverse<br>that too we can have it and you know<br>where the story is going<br>um but for us as Maori it's looking to<br>find these partners and form these<br>relationships practically and get them<br>down here on the ground and working<br>working with us and I can tell you they<br>are really looking forward to it and<br>they put a lot of value on the fact that<br>we are indigenous people that think very<br>very long term they put a lot of value<br>on that interestingly the Germans<br>particularly the most strong and then as<br>well the Dutch<br>here's another project don't have time<br>away I would have shown you the short<br>video about some work we're doing with a<br>with a tribe in British Columbia they've<br>done the renewable energy stuff already<br>their whole Community is is powered by<br>renewable energy and now they're moving<br>on to other stuff it's really cool but<br>just don't have the time to show you the<br>short video so we're using their<br>information and their ideas to help move<br>our stuff forward a lot faster it took<br>them 10 years our objective is to<br>achieve some of these outcomes in the<br>next two years even though members of my<br>project team keep telling me you're<br>going too fast you're going too fast<br>um but I I take my lead from Mount croa<br>they tell me<br>they tell me get on with it do it<br>um so unfortunately I can't show you<br>that video you I think you would have<br>really enjoyed it but so that's in uh um<br>the the southern tip of Vancouver Island<br>and we're working with a lot of other<br>indigenous people too on a whole lot of<br>different fronts<br>um here's my last I heard the Bell going<br>there and my last slide<br>um so sustainable development it's<br>something that fundamentally underpins<br>who we are as Maori we'll have a<br>different way of thinking about about<br>these issues<br>um but we'll be a major part of this<br>economy going forward as you can see<br>from some of those slides up those<br>graphs that I put up there<br>and and I think I think and this is one<br>of the views that I think some of the<br>European people that we've we've linked<br>up with enjoy<br>that you know having this kind of you<br>can think and plan for the long term<br>there has to be a good thing that not<br>just for Maori I think it has to be a<br>good thing for New Zealand and I'm<br>observing that this is something that's<br>that's growing around the world<br>um but we also have an important and I<br>think unique leadership role to play I<br>could go into a lot of detail but my<br>tripping around through Europe<br>um the Europeans and some of those those<br>countries up there they are bilingual<br>like Maori they are bilingual and they<br>buy into this kind of bilingual um view<br>that we have as Maori and so therefore<br>we can talk readily together about<br>Commerce and a whole lot of other things<br>um and key to this this is my last point<br>the world's best knowledge and<br>Partnerships are fundamentally key to<br>our strategy so that's it and I don't<br>well that was a lovely um talk and I<br>know that there'll be lots of questions<br>in terms of some of the stuff that you<br>more detail on some of the stuff that<br>you have raced over to cover so much in<br>there<br>so what I'd like to do with it um is<br>invite our last two speakers up<br>Professor Juliet Roper and associate<br>professor Eva Collins to share with them<br>us some insights on sustainability and<br>thank you<br>I didn't touch a button she gave me the<br>okay so um we're going to do a sort of<br>tag team approach to this talk and talk<br>about<br>um our research but largely where our<br>research is leading us to think about<br>the future and the overall approach<br>we're going to take is one that a<br>colleague and I've been using uh more<br>and more in our classes with our<br>postgraduate students and this is a<br>scenarios approach<br>looking at scenarios planning and<br>thinking ahead looking at where we are<br>now what are the key driving forces that<br>are pushing change or not pushing change<br>and what might happen if particular<br>driving forces intersect and you'll see<br>that our whole presentation will follow<br>this format<br>okay so where are we now now this<br>picture is not meant to directly point a<br>finger at Farmers or farming but it is a<br>representative image of where we are now<br>with our environmental situation we do<br>have environmental problems we do need<br>to address them and we are not<br>what we sometimes need to take a step<br>back from and think about is that for a<br>sustainable Society a sustainable Planet<br>a sustainable country whichever<br>perspective you're taking we have to<br>think about the balance between<br>government business and Society<br>and the balance shifts depending on<br>swing of ideological views economic<br>situations but essentially<br>each sector is dependent upon the other<br>and the balance of power and<br>responsibility shifts according to<br>circumstances at a given time and place<br>now we're talking about where are we now<br>still the government in New Zealand<br>adopts a free market approach along with<br>that is generally as far as possible a<br>hands-off approach when it comes to<br>Social and environmental legislation<br>maybe I better hold that thing<br>um<br>so business largely not entirely of<br>course but largely a voluntary approach<br>to environmental and social impacts and<br>Society<br>to this day remains largely identified<br>as consumers but there is<br>um<br>part of our research looked at the<br>discourse or the language that policy<br>makers public officials use so let me<br>share two quotes I have my glasses with<br>me share two quotes from the same agency<br>Ministry of Economic Development the<br>first one's from 2008. sustainability is<br>firmly at the heart of the New Zealand<br>government's agenda it underpins the<br>government's themes of economic<br>transformation national identity and<br>Families<br>same agency in 2010 the overarching goal<br>of the government is to grow the New<br>Zealand economy to deliver greater<br>Prosperity security<br>and opportunities for all new zealanders<br>so you can see in the quote from 2010<br>the language that's used sustainability<br>has dropped right off and economic<br>development is given priority and so<br>what does it matter what the language or<br>the discourse that public policy<br>decision makers are are using and what<br>we found in our research is that the<br>language that public policy makers use<br>is reflected in the media and this is<br>just an example from the New Zealand<br>Herald tracking the word sustainability<br>and its derivatives like sustainable<br>development<br>and you can see that it peaks in 2008<br>and then drops down quite significantly<br>and we know that a lot of people use the<br>media to inform themselves about issues<br>and so if it's not discussed it's<br>difficult to be informed<br>another part of the research that we've<br>conducted has tracked the uptake of<br>Social and environmental practices by<br>businesses in New Zealand since 2003.<br>and what jumps out I don't have I don't<br>have Chris's little blight but what<br>jumps out is is the no one so at a time<br>when many people would consider that we<br>have increasing environmental concerns<br>what what companies are saying to us is<br>that there's no pressure to adopt<br>environmental practices and you can see<br>that by the central government results<br>as well the the other results I note on<br>this slide is<br>um the the steady but growing pressure<br>from consumers still not big at 30<br>percent but continues to increase over<br>the years and in our research consumers<br>tended to be not individual consumers<br>that businesses were experiencing the<br>pressure but business to business<br>pressure<br>okay and this is the last slide looking<br>at where we are now and it's just to<br>show that we're not alone in New Zealand<br>alarmingly internationally and this this<br>is research done across 18 countries up<br>until<br>2012.<br>concern about major environmental issues<br>including climate change has dropped off<br>considerably and you can see how it it's<br>tracking so<br>you would assume that A reduced concern<br>would mean a reduced drive for action<br>okay so what are the key driving forces<br>for change we would say that three of<br>the top ones are social demands resource<br>constraints and enabling Technologies<br>and we'll take a a quick look at an<br>okay<br>from the social demand perspective we<br>can see a direct impact when we look at<br>the policies that big international well<br>you these are all UK based but globally<br>reaching supermarkets they know through<br>their research that there is a growing<br>trend of consumers wanting<br>sustainability sustainably derived<br>products and they are wanting to keep<br>ahead of the curve so that they can<br>guarantee their customers that<br>everything they buy in their<br>supermarkets they've already done the<br>work they know that it is sustainable<br>and this does have a flow on effect for<br>us one<br>in particular is that the pressure to<br>get these sustainably derived products<br>flows on down the supply chain and that<br>includes New Zealand so there is an<br>so Juliet and I have done some work with<br>New Zealand's sustainable Business<br>Council and it's linked with the World<br>Council for sustainable development and<br>what they did was they got together the<br>top scientists in the world and the work<br>is called planetary boundaries looking<br>at where we're putting the most pressure<br>on our resources and the sustainable<br>Business Council in New Zealand has some<br>of the top businesses in New Zealand and<br>they what they did was they took that<br>information and they said what future<br>what's our vision for New Zealand in<br>2050 so quite a long-term Outlook not<br>quite as long as 100 years but long for<br>business<br>what's our what's our vision what do we<br>want and then they use that as a<br>platform for action<br>what do we need to do what do we need to<br>put in our business plans in 2020 if<br>this is the vision we want for 2050. the<br>other thing I'll just note on on this<br>graphic is that when we're looking at<br>these issues it really requires a<br>systems approach you can't separate<br>climate change out from water out from<br>biodiversity they're all quite linked<br>and that that makes it a little bit<br>complicated sometimes<br>um another key driving force is enabling<br>Technologies and Steve talked about that<br>with his new business model with online<br>business another example and I have some<br>of my students out here smiling because<br>they know this story is All Good bananas<br>so<br>um there are significant negative social<br>and environmental impacts the way<br>commercial bananas are grown and this is<br>your fun fact to take away tonight New<br>Zealand is the largest consumer of<br>bananas per capita I know fascinating<br>and yet there's these negative<br>consequences and so a group of kiwis got<br>together and said right we're going to<br>be we're going to form a company there's<br>there initially there was five of them<br>and we're going to import the first in<br>New Zealand fair trade third party<br>certified bananas so they have to meet a<br>certain social and environmental<br>standards and so there's five and<br>they're up against these big<br>multinational corporations it seems like<br>a grim story right<br>they use social media and they do<br>fantastic and so they have five percent<br>of the New Zealand bananas Market it's<br>worth millions of dollars pretty pretty<br>darn good for for five of them and yet<br>here's the other side of the technology<br>story<br>um of course there was a competitor<br>response Dole looks over at him and says<br>actually we're ethical<br>and no we're not going to go to a third<br>party to certify that we're ethical<br>we're going to put a sticker on our<br>bananas and so when you're a shopper<br>with a nanosecond to make that banana<br>purchase decision and and Dole has their<br>ethical self-certified ethical choice<br>and all good has their fair trade it's<br>it's hard to know the difference and so<br>the other side of the technology story<br>though is that businesses are a lot more<br>transparent whether or not they want to<br>be transparent so it goes through social<br>media and the ethics of what dole is<br>doing is starts getting talked about<br>there's a complaint with the Commerce<br>Commission because uh felt like that<br>Dole was misleading consumers and they<br>have to withdraw that that sticker<br>so thinking back again about that<br>graphic that Juliet started with about<br>the balance between business government<br>and society and here's a quote from Dow<br>Chemical that I want you to think about<br>the current world order or disorder is<br>based on entrenched and dysfunctional<br>systems with no one person one company<br>or one government at the controls<br>yeah<br>Okay so<br>where does sustainable balance live and<br>we think that it is beginning to shift<br>so just if just want to bring you back<br>to to this shift and then we'll move<br>straight on<br>um<br>with the the scenario thinking<br>when you do scenarios planning you take<br>you choose two driving forces and you<br>plot them against each other with an as<br>an x and y axis and you start to look at<br>what might happen if they intersect<br>so what we did with this one and this<br>this is not necessarily looking terribly<br>far out into the future<br>and so it's not really radical but I<br>think it's radical in terms of what we<br>have in a number of institutions in New<br>Zealand today as an entrenched way of<br>thinking now<br>across the x-axis as you can see we have<br>an inactive Society moving through to an<br>active one and the y-axis is business<br>change versus business as usual now if<br>you plot an inactive Society a society<br>that doesn't care doesn't pressure its<br>government for change or doesn't<br>pressure business for change<br>and business doesn't change on its own<br>the graphic I mean I had fun choosing<br>some graphics but I think it gives the<br>picture<br>but I don't think that is where we are I<br>think that we have some steady movement<br>up into that top left hand quadrant<br>and a lot of businesses are making<br>Headway Chris is talking about Maori<br>business it's embedded in the way they<br>think doll bananas there are lots of<br>examples in New Zealand so we are seeing<br>this this shift<br>but we want to go further and we want to<br>say okay what if you get this business<br>changing<br>but there are not enough businesses are<br>changing so maybe and our research shows<br>this that there are many who are still<br>down in the lower<br>left quadrant<br>and then if you get business changing<br>but you also get an active society which<br>we we as we said there are indications<br>that this is this is stirring up more<br>and more<br>then what we predict is happening and<br>there are indications especially<br>internationally that is this shift is<br>just coming<br>businesses are starting to call on<br>governments to legislate to bring in<br>what they're calling smart legislation<br>and we can speculate as to the reasons<br>for this but I would say that one of the<br>strongest one is to<br>produce a Level Playing Field so that<br>those first movers in business who were<br>looking for increased profits from their<br>competitive Advantage but the laggards<br>the business as usual lot have not come<br>forward fast enough and perhaps Society<br>has not been as active as we might have<br>hoped<br>their outlay in changing their systems<br>has been quite high and they may not be<br>getting the returns that they'd hoped<br>but if legislation is brought in<br>for example around emissions for Waste<br>for water consumption than any other<br>range of criteria you want to think<br>about then others are forced up and the<br>living the playing field is leveled we<br>predict<br>that<br>the shift is coming into that top right<br>hand quadrant<br>okay and straight to the last<br>what we want to put to you is what if<br>we're right<br>this is controversial there are many who<br>for one would discount scenarios<br>planning they say it's speculation but<br>better with foresight rather than<br>hindsight<br>and if we are right what are the<br>consequences what are the consequences<br>for us as Citizens and consumers what<br>are the consequences for doing business<br>and that's the one most pertinent<br>tonight and what are the consequences<br>for government<br>and maybe more so as election year comes<br>up<br>thank you very much<br>um Juliet and Eva I think that leaves us<br>with some really quite interesting<br>things that we can ask some questions<br>around all of our speakers tonight have<br>have talked about exploring exploring<br>what potential we have for the future<br>and also that there is a tension between<br>exploring and the exploitation that is<br>also happening from some business from<br>government and also from society so I<br>open it up to the floor for questions<br>because I can<br>play works I guess and but I've also<br>emphasized importance of being fair and<br>throughout the world<br>difference of financial crime<br>and I'm surprised to a small degree that<br>you could be so confident about the<br>Maori future in Business Without also<br>addressing the possibility of of<br>financial crime within your ranks and uh<br>also the financial crime which will be<br>particip um<br>be used in order to try to combat even<br>with what you are trying to do for the<br>Maori people we must look that the New<br>Zealand Society of business has been<br>based on the idea that there will be<br>Maori<br>availability of in uh of uh<br>um poorly financed<br>support workers<br>gradually we're moving losing that and<br>that's good we're moving to the island<br>people and that's bad and we're moving<br>to any people in the world that's bad<br>it's time that the white people<br>obviously started to face up to the fact<br>that everybody in this world is equal to<br>everybody else and everybody and should<br>obviously I I guess that that question<br>is aimed at me so I'll have a Cricket<br>answering you know if I firstly if I<br>understand the question you made the<br>point about<br>um the prospect of financial crime both<br>within the Maori ranks and and the The<br>Wider ranks if you like I think if I<br>understand your your question here in<br>New Zealand The Wider ranks given what's<br>happened given the global financial<br>crisis so so if I understand that that's<br>your question is what is the the concern<br>or is does that does that pose an issue<br>for Maori going forwards I think there<br>was a second question in there too<br>um going forwards and I guess my the<br>answer to Mike to that question if I<br>understand it correctly you're going to<br>get financial problems in wherever you<br>go in any Financial market and we're<br>seeing that all over the world we're<br>seeing that here in New Zealand not just<br>with Maori<br>um I I think the the way for for<br>certainly for us to think about that<br>issue is to take a long-term view you<br>know where do we want to be in the next<br>5 10 15 20 50 100 years from now<br>um and sure we might get something that<br>happens at one at some near point but<br>that doesn't if you like<br>um distract us from where we want to be<br>over the long term if I understand that<br>that's your question so we take a<br>long-term view uh and and like it's it's<br>not an issue that's particular to Maori<br>um that somebody goes off the rails and<br>and does something that's something<br>that's Universal around the world<br>um but the difference that we have is we<br>we won't be distracted<br>um over the where we want to get to over<br>the long term<br>over that so I'm not sure if that if I<br>understand your question and your last<br>point that you made was the point about<br>yes I I completely agree and uh I guess<br>that's the point I'm pointing to up<br>there if I if I use the the example<br>there where government policy was<br>discriminatory to the tune of 600<br>million dollars against Maori interest<br>in favor of polluters<br>oh<br>stimulated me the fact that you had lost<br>the<br>support of government purely on<br>political uh<br>reasons well well look it wasn't a<br>political reason the reason they did it<br>was that and this gets to the point that<br>Julia Juliet's made it was that there<br>was a strong Lobby group in New Zealand<br>that had a vested interest that that<br>that lobbied the New Zealand government<br>and these were the polluters the energy<br>companies and they basically lobbied<br>that the government Drive the price of<br>quite a nice thing that I'd like to put<br>the two professors about key drivers<br>what happens when key driver agree meets<br>the y-axis of enough running out<br>that is a scenario which could happen<br>I would hate to see it happen it would<br>be universally disastrous and again I<br>think<br>well one would hope that at that point<br>society would be in such a state that<br>citizens would stand up and demand of<br>their government that something change<br>well one would hope and this is why we<br>talk about the balance between business<br>government and society when one thing<br>gets one sector gets out of kilter too<br>much the others step up and increase<br>pressure<br>yeah I just want to add to that that I<br>think we start going down a slippery<br>slope when we talk about economic<br>well-being as separate from<br>environmental well-being and that I you<br>know that's a that's an old pattern and<br>um instead what we like to talk about is<br>that when business starts to pay<br>attention to the environment and pay<br>attention to its people it almost always<br>makes good economic sense as well and so<br>gentleman down here<br>hi first of all I um just wanted to say<br>thanks to all the presenters tonight as<br>a very enlightening each one of your<br>presentations my question is for Steve<br>just wondering what one of your biggest<br>challenges has been since you've started<br>um that it's not limited<br>um by geography and the fact that the<br>whole world's my competition<br>so I thought I was smart<br>sort of<br>been able to sack everyone else in but<br>they're also sacking from the big the<br>big businesses offshore so that's<br>probably the the biggest shock and the<br>my question is for the two professors<br>I'm not an academic I'm just an observer<br>but I applaud the quadrant I hope they<br>were going to Aspire to the top right<br>hand quadrant but aren't we if we wish<br>to be the rock star of<br>um the examples in the world aren't we<br>stifled by globalization if not<br>the initiatives around the Pacific for<br>various contracts the ftas or the TPP<br>because don't we have to comply with<br>other<br>jurisdictions when it comes to their<br>policies<br>understand my question<br>um well I I think I understand what<br>you're saying a lot of the trends we've<br>noticed are actually coming from outside<br>New Zealand<br>um and that's going to have a flow on<br>pressure onto New Zealand I'm not<br>talking about New Zealand in isolation<br>at all and I think it would be a big<br>mistake for us to ever think of<br>ourselves as in isolation because we're<br>not<br>but but in response to that I find Kyoto<br>and Copenhagen to be disasters when it<br>comes to us wishing to implement some<br>good climate change policies we've been<br>stifled by you know the world position<br>on um<br>on the various programs so surely we<br>must to some extent isolate ourselves if<br>we want to implement the top right hand<br>quadrant<br>foreign<br>climate change is a global problem<br>there's no putting up a wall and<br>defending yourself from climate change<br>and there's been a lot of argumentation<br>in New Zealand that where smaller<br>impacts are small and we should not do<br>anything ahead of the bigger polluters<br>and<br>that again is a matter of opinion one<br>which I would strongly disagree with<br>it<br>there is a lot of movement amongst<br>European countries in particular towards<br>reducing carbon emissions it's been<br>increasingly built into policy other<br>countries are doing it in different ways<br>um<br>I agree it's a problem when everybody is<br>not in step<br>but I don't think that any of us can<br>okay I'm going to sound like Pollyanna a<br>little bit I realize but I'm going to go<br>for it anyway<br>um<br>so I see that as an opportunity and I<br>see it as an opportunity because Steve<br>made the comment that what are we six<br>years behind did you say and that and<br>that happens with issue after issue and<br>so we can look globally and see what the<br>trends are and be smarter about it and<br>so I think because of our size because<br>of our our edge of the world positioning<br>that actually we can take a more<br>Innovative approach but again that<br>sounds a little bit Pollyanna<br>just a a brief comment to that that<br>point and uh having sat in Copenhagen<br>set in in those different discussions<br>around the world and it is like watching<br>paint dry<br>um in in those discussions people<br>arguing countries arguing about where to<br>put a comma in a in a in a line<br>um but I think the point I really want<br>to tie it back to the point that Juliet<br>made um in in her presentation and that<br>was that in 2008 we had government<br>policy in New Zealand led by Helen Clark<br>uh and and the graph showed that there<br>was you know that was there was strong<br>uptake both here domestically but my<br>point is also internationally New<br>Zealand under that that government<br>leadership was seen as being a global<br>leader in this space despite our small<br>size a lot of the big nations of the<br>world were looking to New Zealand<br>despite our small size and now<br>subsequent to Helen Clark's departure<br>and change in government New Zealand is<br>being shunned by some of these same<br>companies because of the policy shift<br>that has has occurred here in New<br>Zealand in those International<br>discussions<br>I have a question from the floor might<br>no<br>okay well um oh we've got the yes sorry<br>because there's no other questions I've<br>got one for Chris uh 15 years ago I was<br>involved with Maori Commerce and I was<br>asked by the New Zealand Maori Council<br>to come on and assist him in the kaupapa<br>and I was sitting in a<br>Lobby hotel lobby with Instagram let him<br>know he says<br>Brian if you want to come on board<br>that's fine<br>but the bus has got 16 steering wheels<br>uh Maori Commerce in other words the bus<br>was dysfunctional and I'm talking about<br>leadership and of course he was at the<br>Helm of the leaders<br>um<br>and I did experience that 16 wheel bus<br>uh that was 15 years ago if if um and I<br>applaud your comment about if you want<br>to be a good leader you've got to piss<br>some people off my experiences with<br>Maori commerce was there were 16 pissed<br>off steering wheels all pissing on each<br>other<br>your your sickness<br>your success must suggest to me that um<br>when it comes to leadership Maori have<br>sorted out their backyard or do we still<br>have the difficulties of um mana fenua<br>and<br>you know each each each<br>group I was going to say eweek but each<br>group of Maori wishing to drive their<br>own destiny<br>yeah good question um<br>the the answer to that is uh we all of<br>the Year we're in the country they still<br>retain their own separate identity and<br>they still have all their own internal<br>struggles and they still all have their<br>own individual steering wheels<br>um but importantly what I've observed is<br>and I use the two examples well actually<br>one example I put up up there was where<br>there are common interest in my<br>observation working uh with this group<br>of leadership over the last five or so<br>years where there is a common interest<br>it's very very simple in fact<br>frighteningly quick at how things can<br>actually happen among that group where<br>there is common interest where there's<br>common interest and so I I use the the<br>example of the geothermal work that<br>we're doing and bringing the people from<br>wagonen so I talked to the leaders and I<br>mean the leaders the elected leaders of<br>five UE that have geothermal Steam and I<br>said would you be interested in having a<br>discussion around this when we've got<br>the business case they've basically said<br>call a meeting when you've got the<br>business case and we'd really like to to<br>participate in that discussion around<br>co-investment that's one example another<br>example that I'll use is fishing I've<br>been involved in setting up a fishing<br>joint venture with Maori with that<br>involved 12 UE<br>that was 12 UE trying to bring together<br>all of their small lots of quota to<br>actually create some scale in order to<br>actually create some leverage out there<br>into the marketplace put the business<br>case together and getting those 12 years<br>to sign that that document wasn't hard<br>and and actually the scary thing about<br>it is we've now got six more you'll be<br>saying well where do we sign so why do I<br>think that it's happening like that what<br>what's changed I guess one of the things<br>that I've observed is Maori have trained<br>a lot of their own people sent them off<br>to University and study fishing industry<br>studied farming study Commerce study law<br>and it's actually Maori now developing<br>their own Solutions and so when you have<br>a Maori person taking a proposal to a<br>group like that because it is a Maori<br>person with shared values it's actually<br>I'm finding and observing they're very<br>ready to buy into it but I come back to<br>your point are there still the mini<br>steering wheels out there yes they're<br>many steering wheels out there but I<br>don't think that's particular to Maori<br>but where there is a common interest my<br>observation it's it's actually Commerce<br>in whichever sector of society the<br>steering wheels are more or less visible<br>I just saw Alistair Barry's film hot air<br>on the politics of New Zealand's<br>attitude to climate change and there's<br>so much of what was done was not<br>the information wasn't available to the<br>rest of us in society I highly commend<br>the film it's devastating critique of<br>how policy is formed in New Zealand<br>thank you and I think that that point we<br>have a lot more transparency today and<br>therefore I think with all the comments<br>that have come from our speakers there<br>is the ability to enact a lot more<br>change as Society because of<br>transparency and knowing what is<br>actually going on<br>that point<br>um I would like to invite Professor Roy<br>Crawford back off for some closing um<br>words we will be meeting for drinks with<br>speakers will be around at the um Opus<br>just outside so if you have got any<br>further questions for them please feel<br>free to join us<br>just very quickly to round off the<br>evening can I thank all of you for<br>coming along and showing an interest in<br>this first of our winter lecture series<br>and on your behalf can I thank Heather<br>and the panel for their simulating talks<br>I'm sure we could go on with an open<br>discussion for quite some time but as<br>Heather has said there will be an<br>opportunity outside and there is a pay<br>bar I have to stress it's a pay bar and<br>the and Heather and the team will be<br>there to answer any questions or take<br>part in further discussion<br>um<br>I do have for each of them a small gift<br>from the University just to thank them<br>for their contribution so if I can<br>now<br>um if you have enjoyed the evening and<br>can spread the word to your colleagues<br>and friends that would be good next week<br>the winter lecture series is about cyber<br>security<br>we had touched uh this evening a little<br>bit on the internet and its usefulness<br>and business but I think we all every<br>day get involved in using the internet<br>and of course we put in our passwords<br>and then we try to remember what they<br>were<br>and I saw today in an article that some<br>hackers I think in Russia have stolen<br>1.5 billion passwords and then you rush<br>to the computer and think do I need to<br>change mine next week the talk will be<br>about cyber security what does it mean<br>for all of us and we'll have a panel of<br>experts who will be speaking to us about<br>that<br>so thank you very much for coming along<br>there is the opportunity to mix and<br>mingle outside and thank you very much<br>thank you<br>the University of waikato</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
