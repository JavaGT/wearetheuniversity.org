There's a large amount of "to lease" signs, and complaints of vagrants in the city centre. Can we learn anything about building a better city from our Canadian namesake, Hamilton, Ontario â€“ a city that has successfully overcome its 'steel-worker town' reputation to become Ontario's No. 1 city to invest in? Hear from Neil Everson, the Planning and Economic Department Acting General Manager for the City of Hamilton, Ontario, who joins us via Skype, on how he led the successful revitalisation of his city; Andrew Yeoman, Waikato alumnus and director of Yeoman Developments, as he outlines the philosophy of urban design and its potential benefits for Hamilton; and the University's Professor Natalie Jackson, a demographer who will look at the overall demographics of Hamilton and what an ageing population will mean for Hamilton in the future.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>foreign<br>Aleister Jones<br>and it's my real pleasure to welcome you<br>here this evening to the University of<br>waikato<br>to our final of this year's winter<br>lecture series and I'd like to pass on<br>our apologies of our vice Chancellor<br>Professor Roy Crawford who's unable to<br>be here tonight before we get started<br>proper I just need to run through a few<br>housekeeping matters<br>the restrooms are located in the foyer<br>just opposite the Opus bar in case of<br>emergency please exit through the doors<br>at each side of the bar and ushers and<br>event staff will be able to assist you<br>out safely the assembly area is outside<br>between the academy and shops<br>please check your mobile phones are<br>switched off or tune to silent actually<br>that's a good reminder<br>as most of you are aware the as most of<br>you aware of the University of waikato<br>this year celebrates 50 years of<br>teaching and research excellence<br>so this year's winter lecture Series has<br>been a special one<br>each lecture has a forward Focus theme<br>on business<br>cyber security and entertainment<br>and as we look to the Future and start<br>thinking about what the university will<br>look like over the next 50 years as well<br>as what the city might look like<br>you're also aware the city of Hamilton<br>celebrates 150th that's 150th year this<br>year and it it is we're taking this<br>opportunity to discuss our very own City<br>here tonight and a panel of experts will<br>look at how Hamilton can benefit and<br>create and build a dynamic city and what<br>our population will also look like in<br>the future<br>I think was a very important event on<br>Saturday Sunday sorry<br>the Civic event I think was a wonderful<br>event for the city and a great<br>celebration the diversity that we have<br>in a city<br>it's my real pleasure now to introduce<br>to you the mayor of Hamilton Julie<br>hardacre an alumnus of this University<br>and a very good friend of the university<br>to the stage she'll say a few words<br>everyone and it's my great pleasure to<br>also welcome you here this evening and I<br>do want to congratulate the university<br>on the winter lecture series look it's a<br>great series that they do run and having<br>been a speaker and participant in them<br>several times and in the audience a<br>number of times I'm really pleased to<br>see a big crowd here this evening<br>this year as Alistair said the city's<br>been celebrating its 150 years since<br>European settlements started on the<br>banks of the waikato river and as<br>Aleister said last Sunday we had our<br>official if you like our birthday day<br>was a wonderful celebration and Civic<br>event in Civic Square behind me are a<br>series of images depicting Hamilton<br>Through the Ages that you can enjoy<br>while I just said a few words to this<br>evening<br>I think these celebrations have given us<br>an opportunity to reflect on the past<br>but also to focus on what Hamilton might<br>be like in another 150 years and how we<br>would like to develop and craft our city<br>today for those 150 years you know we<br>started as a small settlement 100 people<br>and today we serve a population of<br>around about 250 000 people<br>I think as a city we have developed into<br>a New Zealand success story and that's<br>been built on a strong economy Rich from<br>the land around us<br>we're home to many young people and<br>families and they are attracted to the<br>lifestyle we have here education choices<br>and the high amenity and Community<br>infrastructure that cities like ours our<br>size can offer its people without those<br>challenges of the enormous cities up to<br>our North we're fast growing and we've<br>got a population of around about 150 000<br>people and tonight Professor Jackson is<br>going to share with you some very<br>valuable and interesting information<br>about the future of Hamilton's<br>population<br>in September this year the council will<br>release the river plan and this will be<br>a plan for over the coming decades when<br>we will develop and enhance the 16<br>kilometers of the waikato river that run<br>through this city<br>this plan represents transformational<br>change for our place Hamilton it<br>includes a complete Redevelopment of the<br>ferrybank area and that will provide a<br>platform for revitalization of our<br>Central City<br>so I'm looking forward tonight to<br>hearing Neil speak from another namesake<br>Hamilton in Canada and the ideas that he<br>might have for us in developing the<br>river plan and also in the work that<br>we've been doing over the last few<br>months on the Central City regeneration<br>we have been looking at the successes<br>and ideas from all around the world so<br>I'm looking forward to some of the<br>things that he can add to that debate<br>I also just want to acknowledge my good<br>friend I guess Andrew Yeomans who's<br>going to talk tonight as well he's one<br>of our outstanding young developers in<br>the city he's been doing some exciting<br>developments some really good<br>developments and I think you'll be<br>really interested in what he's got to<br>say<br>finally just a couple of things that<br>I've been thinking about<br>Hamilton's been described as a teenager<br>about to enter adulthood and I actually<br>think that's a very very good<br>description of where we are today<br>there's a sense of confident maturity<br>starting to come to us as a people<br>and I truly believe we are about to<br>enter our Prime<br>I think we're claiming an identity and a<br>comfort about what we stand for and who<br>we are as a city and a people for me<br>that's agriculture it's business and its<br>families so I think tonight's<br>presentations are going to add to that<br>debate and discussion and I really do<br>hope that you enjoy this evening thank<br>you very much<br>foreign<br>thank you uh Julie for those words and<br>also I think one of the things is that<br>many in the audience here tonight are<br>very passionate about this city and<br>um I want to see it grow and and develop<br>uh in ways that we can be proud of so<br>thank you Julie I'm now delighted to<br>introduce to you<br>um the professor of environmental<br>planning Ian white who will be the host<br>of tonight's lecture please welcome to<br>thank you Professor Jones<br>um it's a pleasure to be facilitating<br>this final winter lecture series and I'd<br>like to thank everyone for coming<br>good planning's absolutely critical to<br>the success of any City and implicit in<br>the rationale for this lectures perhaps<br>we may not have made decisions in the<br>past which are you know we're still<br>reaping the benefits today so if we are<br>still visiting by the ghost of planning<br>decisions past then we need to think<br>about the kind of Legacy we want to<br>leave for the future too<br>so we've got a CBD that is facing a lot<br>of competition from other retail centers<br>and we've turned our back on our<br>greatest asset the river so we need to<br>think about what our city might look<br>like in 150 years time to come<br>one of the reasons why planning often<br>fails to deliver is connected to how<br>it's perceived<br>just what do we want it to do is it a<br>natural<br>really restrained view about just<br>limiting development or issuing consent<br>so is it something a bit more ambitious<br>than that<br>it's unsurprising that we are left with<br>some of the legacies of the past if we<br>look at it in such a limited way<br>so we need to think about enabling<br>cities to adapt into the demands of<br>capitalism and societies more generally<br>and contemporary perspectives see<br>planning very differently than we have<br>done in the past<br>it's about Place creation actually<br>creating the kind of places where people<br>want to be where you want to spend time<br>and where you'd like to spend money and<br>hang out<br>and it's also about its most basic level<br>it's about how we manage space over time<br>for the public good it's one of the few<br>mechanisms societies has to intervene on<br>behalf of everybody all the people in<br>this room<br>and it sees more positive<br>interpretations that can help cities<br>better exploit the potential of good<br>planning<br>is to feature the modern world that<br>capital and people are increasingly<br>mobile and just as Hamilton's trying to<br>attack investment so other places too<br>but this is both a problem and<br>opportunity just as we know that<br>investment can flow away from Hamilton<br>is it may have done in the previous 50<br>years we know that if we make the right<br>decisions now we can create the<br>conditions for it to flow towards us<br>there are examples of cities that have<br>successfully repositioned themselves in<br>the face of changing socio-economic<br>drives our Global Trends but examples<br>are not blueprints we can't necessarily<br>take up what works elsewhere and place<br>it in the middle of Hamilton expect it<br>to work if it was that easy everybody<br>would do it<br>so while we can drop on common<br>characteristics change also needs to<br>rooted in a place and we need to think<br>about the advantages that we as a city<br>can offer<br>from the excellent livability of<br>Hamilton to its demographic stretches to<br>its vibrant knowledge and creative<br>sectors<br>the biggest assets of his people and you<br>could see by you know the number of<br>people who've turned up today to listen<br>to this we all care about the future of<br>Hamilton<br>aspire to be in the future well we've<br>got 45 minutes to sort that out and I'm<br>hoping that by the end of it we'll have<br>a much better idea about where we might<br>want to go but in reality this is a<br>long-term conversation and it's an<br>ongoing discussion I'd encourage you all<br>to be a part of<br>tonight we're going to hear three<br>different perspectives<br>on Hamilton to try and stimulate this<br>debate and then we'll end with a<br>question and answer session from the<br>floor so you'll have a chance to have<br>your say too<br>first we'll have Neil Everson the Arts<br>and general manager of the planning an<br>economic development department of the<br>city of Hamilton in Ontario<br>now he was supposed to join us by video<br>link from Hamilton Ontario in Canada but<br>at the moment we've got a few technical<br>difficulties we're trying to get through<br>to him at the end<br>so we were going to start with Neil but<br>I think we might try and catch him later<br>on<br>well Neil joined the region of Hamilton<br>Wentworth in 1988 and in as well as<br>Hamilton's economic development division<br>director he oversaw the city's economic<br>Resurgence and its successful<br>reinvention from steel worker town it's<br>what is now one of on Taylor's top<br>regions to invest nil is a masters of<br>arts in economics and degrees in<br>business and administration and urban<br>geography<br>he's also a graduate at the University<br>of Waterloo certified economic<br>development program and received his ecd<br>certification 1991. Neil's past<br>president of the Economic Development<br>Association of Canada and is tries to<br>recipient of its president's award for<br>his contribution to Economic Development<br>and the National Association<br>he's also one of three Canadians on the<br>board of directors for the Washington<br>dc-based International Economic<br>Development Council<br>next we have Professor Natalie Jackson<br>Who happily for me is actually present<br>in the room<br>never worked with children animals and<br>Skype<br>um Natalie's professor of demography at<br>the University of waikato and the former<br>director of nydia the National Institute<br>of demographic and economic analysis<br>Natalie gained her PhD in demography<br>from the Australian National University<br>and as Bachelor Master social science<br>degrees from the University of waikato<br>she spent 15 years working in Australia<br>where she was the director of the<br>demographic analytical Services Unit the<br>University of Tasmania and served as<br>vice president and president of the<br>Australian population Association<br>nothing was also involved in several<br>government committees working groups<br>around tables on population aging and<br>since returning to New Zealand she has<br>served as the vice president of the New<br>Zealand population Association<br>Natalie has offered more than 80<br>published articles Butch chapters<br>research and Consulting consultancy<br>reports and a research folks on the<br>different drives and patterns of<br>population aging in Australia and New<br>Zealand<br>now our final speaker is Andrew yeoman<br>Andre is the founder and director of<br>Hamilton Bay's property development firm<br>Yeoman developments<br>Andrea Bartz and his first real estate<br>projects the age of 19. and has since<br>embraced the philosophies of Urban<br>Design a building principle that<br>explores how people connect with the<br>environment around them<br>his recent developments include Queen's<br>Park and the upcoming Village quarter in<br>Frankton is a proponent of increasing<br>high density level in inner city spaces<br>Anders a graduate the University of<br>waikato having completed a bachelor of<br>management studies majoring in finance<br>and Strategic Management in 2013 he won<br>the property Council of New Zealand's<br>young achiever of the Year award for the<br>achievements in property development<br>okay so that's the lineup for Today I<br>think we're going to have a slight<br>change in the old winning order while<br>we're trying our technical problems out<br>so without further Ado I'd like to<br>introduce our first Speaker Professor<br>thank you<br>ladies and gentlemen I'm delighted to<br>present to you this evening on our<br>wonderful City I thought I would just<br>start with a little shot that I have in<br>my files Hamilton's Garden Place there<br>in 1964 when I was 14 and I do actually<br>remember seeing it like that and I'm<br>glad that it looks like it does today<br>rather than like it did there<br>now I'm going to start with um an<br>overview of uh what's going to be<br>happening you know for for Hamilton in<br>terms of its size but I'm going to<br>actually follow on quickly with some<br>data which shows you how we've just got<br>to where we've got and then some<br>challenges that are coming up ahead<br>first thing is that um okay we're<br>turning 150 and as Mia hadaka just said<br>we just turned we just<br>um hit the clock on 150 200 people<br>actually at the 2013 Census so that's<br>quite a nice correlation there uh<br>unbeknown to many Hamilton is also New<br>Zealand's youngest territorial Authority<br>so that's out of 67 we have the youngest<br>population and this is a critical point<br>because going forward it assures us of a<br>vibrant City<br>um because of this youth we have<br>significant growth predicted<br>um we we are one of only three Tas<br>territorial authorities in the country<br>that will have<br>um<br>at least then around about a third of<br>its growth at 65 plus most of the others<br>actually have all of their growth at 65<br>plus and and decline at all other ages<br>so I'm going to tell you about that<br>um the population here is increasingly<br>Cosmopolitan largely due to our<br>wonderful University population<br>but at the end I'm going to go on to<br>this point of the uh an area that I'm<br>looking at in my Marsden research with<br>my colleagues looking at the overall<br>slumming and ending of growth which will<br>actually cause a city like Hamilton some<br>problems because we're going to grow for<br>about another 50 years and then we're<br>going to turn the corner and I'll try<br>and illustrate to you why that's going<br>to happen during this talk but if you're<br>really interested in hearing more about<br>it um you know follow us up and we'll<br>give you some more detail later on it is<br>going to be a challenge because<br>um you know the youngest the youngest<br>populations if you like the the last<br>heads off the rank and the aging process<br>mean that we've got to plan in the<br>shorter term for huge growth build lots<br>of infrastructure but at the end of the<br>day Global growth and National growth<br>will be coming to an end for reasons<br>that I can't really go into in the store<br>okay so as I say we're going to<br>experience significant growth so there<br>we are just passing the 150 000 mark and<br>um the projections show us looking at<br>around about 190<br>000 by about 2033 so we're just you know<br>20 years further along the track and uh<br>around about 221<br>000 probably around mid-century but you<br>see there we there's a large level of<br>uncertainty with projections so the red<br>line at the top is the high projection<br>we could be as high as even 294 000 by<br>mid-century or the low growth scenario<br>which is highly unlikely to happen I<br>think you can forget about it but I have<br>to put it up there<br>160 uh six thousand so<br>significant growth ahead<br>and here's what our population age<br>structure looks like and this is why we<br>have this massive growth ahead or at<br>least one of the main reasons that's our<br>age sex structure with our children on<br>the bottom row and every one different<br>ages standing on each other's shoulders<br>up to our 85 Plus population and you see<br>these little wings on our age structure<br>that's to do with our University and<br>wintech population by comparison there's<br>uh Thames coromandel now waikato is<br>unique because we have both the youngest<br>and the oldest age structures and of<br>course Tim's coromandel as Mia Glenn<br>Leach says is the playground of of<br>waikato people so we have to help to<br>look after that area as well but you see<br>that incredibly different age structures<br>we have a median age for Hamilton of<br>just 32 years and a median age for the<br>Thames coromandel of 51 years so vastly<br>different age structures and we can be<br>I'm highly delighted that the one on the<br>left as<br>we have a highly advantageous uh<br>migration profile so there you see we<br>have a net this is age across the graph<br>and it's showing significant gains at 15<br>to 19 and 20 to 24 but then we also lose<br>out once we've you know trained our<br>young people we lose them they move away<br>at 25 to 29 and also slightly of slight<br>concern was a little bit of a further<br>decline here at 30 to 34 in the most<br>recent interstential period but um<br>overall you know that's a highly<br>advantageous age profile to have for<br>migration because nearly everywhere else<br>has got a very deep dip over 15 to 19<br>and 20 to 24 and we in Hamilton of<br>course gain them<br>we also have a wonderful opportunity in<br>our uh very different age structures of<br>our Maori and European populations for<br>the region here we have median age for<br>the European origin population of over<br>40 years and a median age for the Maori<br>population of just 20 just under 24<br>years a half the Maori population of the<br>waikato region is under the age of 24.<br>so that is part of the reason for our<br>for our growth and also for our future<br>because as the older pakehau population<br>retires disproportionately leaves the<br>labor market our younger Maori<br>population will move in to take its<br>place<br>uh Hamilton has become a a vibrant<br>Cosmopolitan City because of the<br>University population and so on so there<br>we see in 1996 this the color the bottom<br>part here is the European other<br>population readers there is Maori<br>Pacific island population yellow there<br>is the Asian population and the dark<br>area at the top the Middle Eastern Latin<br>American African population and you see<br>how dramatically it's changed in just<br>this short time so we you know really<br>are becoming on the map with a highly<br>highly uh rainbow-like population<br>Hamilton is extremely fortunate to be<br>part of the Golden Triangle of New<br>Zealand Hamilton Auckland and Tauranga<br>and there we see that the share of New<br>Zealand's population that together we<br>collectively account for is just on half<br>and that is going to increase but you<br>see that Auckland will take the larger<br>share they have plenty currently has<br>around about 6.3 percent of all of New<br>Zealand's population waikato about 9.6<br>and these don't really change much but<br>Auckland is projected to keep gaining<br>but we are part of that and uh Hamilton<br>will will certainly get the spillover<br>from Auckland whether it's burgeoning<br>population and you know unaffordable<br>housing and and all the rest of it and<br>we can see it happening around Pocono<br>um within the region uh you can see well<br>I just showed you in the previous slide<br>actually the the shares are<br>quite disproportionate with with<br>Auckland having the greatest year and<br>waikato overall we we're going to get a<br>diminishing share of that uh Golden<br>Triangle as time goes on but it's still<br>sizable because as I'll be showing you<br>in a moment<br>out through the rest of New Zealand most<br>most of the regions growth will end and<br>there will be a lot of decline already<br>one third of our 67 territorial<br>authorities are in permanent Decline and<br>so we can you know count ourselves very<br>fortunate to be where we are<br>um I won't go into these in detail in<br>fact I'm happy to make these slides<br>available to anybody that would like<br>them but essentially this is just<br>showing you that growth was uh uneven<br>for for us between the last two censuses<br>across the region so we see up here uh<br>Thames coromandel for example in the<br>blue areas are declining dark blue areas<br>a lot of decline red areas are growing<br>and so Hamilton grew but a lot of the<br>other parts of the region declined<br>um Hamilton City growth uh you know what<br>what is pulling the population up to the<br>north I'm sure that um Andrew is going<br>to talk about that shortly but you know<br>we see here significant growth these<br>bright red areas at the top north of<br>Hamilton the population growth and and<br>distribution across the region and<br>across within Hamilton is not even some<br>areas growing some declining<br>okay so overall it's good news for us in<br>in the waikato and in Hamilton but good<br>news overall is not without its<br>challenges we do face push and pull<br>factors and what I have some I have half<br>uh five graphs here and I'm just not<br>sure that you're going mats at least<br>sorry I don't know that you're going to<br>see them all that well<br>but um essentially Hamilton City is a<br>magnet for the regions 15 to 19 year<br>olds so there you see<br>and and the dark patch in here we have<br>Hamilton and then all around it this is<br>where we're getting our 15 to 19 year<br>olds from where do they go to they go<br>basically out to the same areas but we<br>we in the last intercessor period gained<br>1785 15 to 19 year olds and they were<br>very thinly spread across the rest of<br>the country so we got more in they all<br>come from these local regions around us<br>uh 20 to 24 year olds also love Hamilton<br>um here they are all coming in from<br>these from the areas around Hamilton and<br>where are they going to<br>um much less spread out where they go<br>but we got a nickname of 2 000<br>335 20 to 24 year old so that was good<br>as well so you know this is really<br>important Hamilton's growth<br>but we do lose our 20 to 25 to 29 year<br>olds and most of them go to Auckland and<br>we need to be trying to figure out why<br>it is that they leave I suspect that<br>it's because we have educated them and<br>once they're educated then they leave<br>they go somewhere else and someone else<br>gets the benefit but we clearly get some<br>of them back as well so<br>um we gained 25 to 29 year olds and even<br>though we had a an overall net loss at<br>that age you know we we're clearly on<br>the map so we need to find out what it<br>is about Hamilton that they like and why<br>they come here<br>um<br>so now I'm just going to move very<br>quickly uh to this whole overall<br>challenge that Hamilton is going to face<br>it's all good we're growing We're Young<br>we're Cosmopolitan we're a magnet for<br>attracting young people some of them<br>Escape but I think maybe some of them<br>come back once they've done their<br>training in other universities as well<br>what we're facing<br>nationally and globally is the ending of<br>population growth which is predicted to<br>be with us by the end of the century so<br>overall global population growth<br>projected to end around the end of the<br>century but much sooner in the developed<br>countries and particularly you know here<br>in New Zealand around in the shortly<br>after the middle part of the century<br>Hamilton City will age like everywhere<br>else so this is what our age structures<br>predicted to look like in 2033 this is<br>even with young migrants coming in our<br>age structure will tip upside down and<br>there you see the unshaded bars are what<br>we're going to look like around about 20<br>33 but we've still got a university<br>it'll all be pleased to know and that<br>keeps our population slightly younger<br>than elsewhere<br>our median age by then in in the future<br>will be have gone up to 42 years but and<br>we're talking 2033 so it'll still be<br>well younger than Tim's coromandel's age<br>structure is today so you can see how we<br>still maintain our youth but as we go<br>forward to 20 sorry that was to 2063 our<br>median age shifts up to around 51 years<br>and by so around about the middle of the<br>century we start to look like Tim's<br>coromandel and this is because birth<br>rates are falling and more people are<br>longer and it just changes the age<br>structure and all sorts and wonderful<br>ways<br>um so we're going to grow but most<br>increasingly the growth will be at older<br>ages because of these declining birth<br>rates and increasing longevity and there<br>you see uh out to 2031 Hamilton<br>projected to grow by about 30 percent<br>but most of that growth being at older<br>ages and these uh these are actual<br>numbers so numerical decline for these<br>younger age groups it's going to make<br>our young people increasingly an<br>endangered species but massive growth at<br>Old ages and massive opportunities for<br>us if we stop fearing it and start<br>building the right sort of houses and so<br>on<br>um natural increase has actually been<br>the cause of population growth that is<br>the difference between births and deaths<br>people when they talk about population<br>they usually think that population<br>growth is all about migration it's not<br>it's disproportionately been natural<br>increase but even in young Hamilton with<br>its um you know its vibrant young<br>population we still face the end of<br>natural increase shortly after the<br>middle of the century once a population<br>you know reaches this point and all of<br>the uh you know this is being drawing<br>here on work that I've been doing with<br>my colleagues Mike Cameron and Bill<br>Cochran uh all of this<br>um data shows us that across New Zealand<br>the same picture as unfolding for<br>Hamilton it's just the shift to Natural<br>the client is later<br>the end of growth is already<br>foreshadowed as I've mentioned um a<br>third of our Tas are already declining<br>the at the 2013 Census we found that<br>um between uh sorry between<br>2001 and 2006 25 of our census area unit<br>uh declined there's about 1860 of them<br>in the country but between 2000 and uh<br>six and 2013 that was 32 so it increased<br>in the South Island uh there were 36<br>percent of our census area units<br>declined in the last sexual period and<br>decentral period now and for the<br>previous uh period it was 20. those blue<br>all of that blue is areas that declined<br>right there in the middle somewhere as<br>Hamilton throwing away but you can see<br>surrounded by just large amtraks of<br>population decline it was much broader<br>than we anticipated and uh and more<br>advanced than had been happening in the<br>previous uh interstitial period so<br>growth with an overall slowing growth<br>and decline just about everywhere else<br>Auckland accounted for 52 of the growth<br>in the last um in the census period and<br>Auckland plus just 11 of the um<br>territorial authorities all of them<br>cities accounted for 75 of growth which<br>meant that the remaining growth was<br>spread very very thinly across just 35<br>territorial authorities so Hamilton<br>again standing out as one of those few<br>that is still really growing<br>as I said aging driven growth is very<br>very different to the youth driven<br>growth that was occurring in um when I<br>was 14 there in 1964 looking out ahead<br>between now and 2031 all growth in 56 of<br>our territorial authorities will be at<br>65 plus years and all other age groups<br>combined 0 to 64 will decline so our age<br>structures will go from being very<br>youthful or relatively youthful<br>depending on where you are to very old<br>and tipping upside down<br>only 11 the previous 11 territorial<br>authorities that I mentioned Escape that<br>scenario and of course Hamilton is one<br>of them growth will definitely come to<br>an end in most of the rest of the<br>territorial authorities the red simply<br>showing you that that is overwhelmingly<br>growth at 65 plus across the whole<br>country that the majority of growth is<br>at 65 Plus<br>and just to finish on a couple of points<br>so that you understand the the overall<br>picture Hamilton growing right here in<br>our midst but<br>New Zealand has been largely protected<br>from the realities of population aging<br>because we had New Zealand's biggest<br>highest baby boom and longest baby boom<br>so that means and we still have the<br>highest birth rate in the developed<br>world so it means that we are you know<br>relatively young in a an overall Global<br>context across the next 17 years across<br>the 58 more developed countries total<br>growth will be less than five percent<br>in at 65 plus that will add almost 100<br>million people to the current 200<br>million at those ages but all other age<br>groups combined not 264 are predicted to<br>decline by 41 million that's out going<br>out 17 years so it means only people 17<br>years and under<br>and not yet born and are not counted in<br>and we've added them in at the going<br>birth rate multiplied by the number of<br>women having children so this is the<br>future and that is a staggering picture<br>and and what is really important about<br>it is it's from here that we seek our<br>skilled migrants so New Zealand's<br>ability to keep getting the migrants<br>that at once going forward will<br>increasingly be challenged<br>just to put it by comparison Auckland uh<br>going out 17 years is projected to grow<br>just a little more than Hamilton to grow<br>by about 33 at 65 plus population more<br>than doubles all other age groups<br>combined grow by 23 but look at the rest<br>of New Zealand overall growth of 11<br>at 65 plus the population almost doubles<br>but all other age groups combined<br>declined by about 1.5 percent so it's<br>that aging process tipping everything<br>upside down and Hamilton shining like a<br>beacon in the Middle with its incredible<br>growth so just to<br>think about what it all means putting it<br>all together in a rapid 15-minute<br>presentation<br>is that what we have to do is as part of<br>our planning processes we have to accept<br>that population aging is a major factor<br>in it we've got a magnificently growing<br>City<br>but population aging is happening here<br>and uh it's going to continue our our<br>age composition will change dramatically<br>uh going out<br>um 5 10 15 years there are a million<br>Baby Boomers in New Zealand and um you<br>know that's a quarter of the population<br>it means a a vastly different shape of a<br>population as they move into old age our<br>growth will slow and will end and our<br>growing regions will face as many if not<br>more challenges than the declining<br>regions because as I said at the start<br>we've got to build infrastructure for a<br>50 year with a 50-year horizon so we've<br>got to build it very very carefully and<br>plan for multiple uses of that<br>infrastructure as we go forward<br>we need to buffer<br>um we need to revisit all our policies<br>and the principles on on which they're<br>based in make sure that we do develop<br>fit for service for purpose models and<br>facilities and services and ratings<br>models I won't get into the political<br>side of rates but when you have a third<br>of your population over the age of 65<br>and they're on fixed incomes it's<br>clearly going to have some impact on uh<br>you know council's abilities to raise<br>rates and provide us with the services<br>we need and last of all it's all about<br>communicating this information<br>collaborating talking about these things<br>and not competing because and especially<br>in Hamilton we don't need to compete for<br>our population we've got it we're<br>assured of it so we can you know plan<br>carefully for that future but you know<br>increasingly we would be we will be<br>competing with if we keep competing um<br>for population from towns other towns<br>will empty out and around us and that<br>will cause massive problems for us<br>longer term as well so we've got we've<br>got good news and we've got challenges<br>ahead thank you okay thank you Professor<br>Jackson<br>um it's pretty rare to hear an academic<br>talk and use the words extremely<br>fortunate good news<br>shining like a beacon so we need to make<br>the most of it while we've got that<br>um one of the things that Nutters talk<br>raised was about population and where<br>people are going to live and that brings<br>us to our next speaker<br>who's Andrew Yeoman who's going to talk<br>to you about the kind of developments<br>that are going on in Hamilton right now<br>vibrancy interactive sociable<br>these are words that describe exciting<br>City traits to achieve this we need a<br>good mix of housing types<br>Hamilton already has a large amount of<br>suburban homes on larger sections we've<br>got relatively small amounts of medium<br>and higher density housing<br>the later brings affordability and<br>encourages interaction especially when<br>they're situated near amenities<br>as Hamilton's population grows we can't<br>keep expanding the boundaries and expect<br>people to live in the same style of<br>housing as surrounding blocks<br>this type of development pushes<br>development costs higher due to the<br>amount of new infrastructure required<br>and the costs of maintaining that<br>infrastructure<br>it also leads to hamiltonians being<br>reliant on their cars which isn't good<br>for their health or good for the<br>environment<br>in my opinion we need to offer more<br>medium and high density Housing close to<br>the central city but also in key Urban<br>nodal points such as rototuna for<br>example<br>there's certainly still a demand for the<br>Suburban Suburbia type house but it's<br>not everyone's cup of tea not everyone<br>can afford it not everyone wants to be<br>situated so far away from the CBD not<br>everyone wants to sit in their cast for<br>25 minutes each way not everyone has the<br>same lifestyle of Two and a Half kids<br>and a yard to maintain the market is<br>mixed and therefore I think housing<br>when we talk about higher density living<br>some people cringe and think that it<br>means slums<br>without the correct design guidelines<br>yep it can result in an undesirable<br>place to live similar to this photo this<br>is in Mumbai I think it is<br>this is what I would call bad density<br>but if it's designed according to good<br>Urban Design principles high density can<br>result in creating some of the most<br>beautiful cities in the world these<br>beautiful places in the world<br>places like this places like Paris Rome<br>Copenhagen San Francisco<br>when I talk about design I'm not solely<br>talking about the architecture of an<br>individual building<br>that is important but focusing strictly<br>on the design of the building itself can<br>be dangerous<br>while it may look great on paper and in<br>a 3D model<br>if the building is placed in the wrong<br>context it can create a negative impact<br>designing individual buildings should<br>take into account<br>does the building address the street<br>the public spaces and the surrounding<br>buildings is the front entrance of the<br>building clearly defined<br>simply put it shouldn't present a blank<br>wall where everyone walks by rather it<br>should engage with the surrounding area<br>and it should also clearly Define what<br>is public space and what is private<br>space<br>good quality evident design takes into<br>account the character and the culture of<br>the neighborhood it will reflect and<br>enhance the neighborhood with new<br>buildings being appropriate for and<br>complementing the surrounding buildings<br>as an example if you were to take<br>Hamilton if you take claudlands and<br>Hamilton East<br>perhaps developing a five-story glass<br>and steel structure is not the most<br>appropriate type it might be a little<br>bit out of place but if you put a<br>two-story Villa or Bungalow development<br>in there that would fit in a lot better<br>as we've seen in some of the earlier<br>photos of gun density<br>amongst juice development was perhaps<br>some retail or office space on the<br>ground floor like like in this photo<br>here with apartments above can be a good<br>The Village quarter this is one of the<br>developments that I'm working on at the<br>moment it's currently under construction<br>it's on the corner of Hall Street and<br>Lake Road in Frankton<br>it's a mixed-use development it's got a<br>bit of office space but a retail space<br>and it's got 49 Apartments<br>um in an on-site Cafe as well gem Cafe<br>is going here so very excited about that<br>it's walking distance to the CBD and<br>it's in the heart of Frankton shopping<br>area also walking distance from<br>Queens Park is a subdivision in Hamilton<br>that we completed at the start of this<br>year<br>it's also walking distance to CBD the<br>lake and other amenities and for this<br>particular development we're really<br>focused on good quality Urban Design<br>okay which is the essence of safe<br>friendly neighborhoods from Years Gone<br>by<br>the character style homes fit in with<br>the style of the surrounding houses<br>the houses face the street while the<br>garages are located off access ways<br>Treeline streets and a communal Village<br>Green will further enhance this sense of<br>community<br>to kind of sum up<br>um<br>people I think are what makes cities<br>vibrant<br>or not with a lot of people spread out<br>over large tracks of land and suburbia<br>you can get a ghost town effect if you<br>have more good quality<br>Urban good quality density in the CBD<br>Fringe and key nodal points like<br>um interesting comparison<br>um Hamilton City about 150 000 people<br>spread out over about 98 kilometers uh<br>square kilometers<br>there's another city of about the same<br>size it's about 105 square kilometers<br>it's called Paris and uh that has 2.2<br>million people in that City<br>so I think we can fit a few more people<br>without needing to expand anymore<br>I think we need to Twin with Paris next<br>quite obviously thanks for that<br>suggestion<br>um now I've been informed that we the<br>thumbs up has come from the technical<br>people and we have the the overseas<br>speaker<br>Neil Everson from Hamilton<br>oterry should be joined us by Skype so<br>hopefully<br>over to Neil good morning you worship<br>mayor hardacre and my fellow<br>hamiltonians<br>well for me it's still the wee hours of<br>the morning here and as I you may have<br>heard me say we're expecting a<br>thunderstorm in about an hour<br>you know I'm not sure who gave me the<br>more suspicious look when I left home at<br>uh about an hour ago my wife or the dog<br>uh actually I think it was a dog because<br>being a creature of habit he expects his<br>morning walk but uh never this early<br>um it was certainly<br>a pleasant surprise for me when I<br>received an email from Nicola Lee<br>inviting me to speak at your winter<br>lecture series<br>but what was really fascinating is the<br>more I read about your Hamilton the more<br>amazed I was to learn about our<br>similarities so if I can I'm just going<br>to give you a brief introduction about<br>here you can see<br>the 100 meter high Niagara escarpment<br>I'm just going to go back to that story<br>the Niagara scartman physically<br>separates our miss our city into two<br>halves the lower city which is the the<br>original part of the town and you can<br>see our downtown core there and our<br>Waterfront and where we have 250 000<br>people in the the lower City and then<br>the upper city which is when we ran out<br>of room and had to build up on top of<br>this garment we have another 280 000 uh<br>people there and of course most of you<br>will know the Niagara Cartman which is<br>what the Niagara River flows over uh<br>being one of the world's natural wonders<br>which is Niagara Falls only 50<br>so um let me start by uh I'm just giving<br>you a few facts and some history uh our<br>uh your namesake municipality here in<br>Ontario was founded in 1812 by<br>transplanted Scott name of uh by name of<br>the George Hamilton now for those of you<br>over 50 that's not the uh the suntan<br>actor that we knew in the 70s<br>uh the city itself was incorporated in<br>1849 so we had our sesquicentennial just<br>a while back we're actually for those of<br>you not familiar with the geography of<br>of Canada we are 50 miles from Toronto<br>and 50 miles from Niagara Falls we're on<br>um the War of 1812 and again a little<br>bit of a history lesson here was fought<br>between the Americans and the British<br>and remember that Hamilton uh that<br>Canada was still a colony back then<br>though most Brits seemed to think we<br>still are one<br>uh this was a conflict that triggered<br>the migration of the United Empire<br>loyalists the former British settler<br>they were former British settlers<br>settlers loyal to the crown and after<br>the uh the independence from uh from<br>Britain the Americans began to start to<br>persecute some of the United Empire<br>loyalists so there was a migration to<br>Canada and the majority of them settled<br>actually in Hamilton<br>uh and let me tell you they were a<br>feisty group of people a few few of us<br>know or a few people actually do know<br>that it was these United Empire<br>loyalists along with a handful of<br>British troops and our first Nations<br>indigenous peoples the Iroquois and the<br>Mohawks that conducted a secret raid and<br>actually burned down the president's<br>house in Washington of course now being<br>but with the exception of uh Olympic<br>hockey that was the last battle we<br>fought with our neighbors to the South<br>in the 1800s Hamilton established itself<br>as a food processing in a textile center<br>and in fact we still have a number of uh<br>of large industrial textile firms here<br>in the in the community<br>in fact excuse me if you've taken a<br>plane or a train recently then you've<br>probably sat on a seat manufactured in<br>Hamilton<br>our City's reputation although built on<br>steel a few few people and and<br>know that Agriculture and farming is<br>actually an integral part of our our<br>local economy you can see that the<br>economic impact of the agriculture alone<br>is 900 million but when you add on our<br>food processing sector it's<br>approximately about two billion dollars<br>a year<br>another thing that I found in common<br>between Hamilton New Zealand and<br>Hamilton Ontario as both of us have a<br>very large dairy industry<br>we have perhaps some of the best in<br>putting humility aside some of the best<br>dairy farms in the country and<br>particularly a lot of innovation they<br>work with the University of Guelph which<br>is just a few kilometers from us who<br>specializes in veterinarian medicines<br>and and agriculture<br>uh by the early uh I wanted to show you<br>this map here to give you a bill of a<br>perspective of where we are situated so<br>you can see that Hamilton is right at<br>the corner of Lake Ontario and within a<br>one-days uh drive we have access to a<br>market of 120 million people<br>um one of the reasons why this area has<br>developed so well historically<br>by the uh<br>by the early 1900s the economy was<br>transforming into a home for heavy<br>industry primarily for a few reasons one<br>because of our proximity to large coal<br>and iron ore deposits access to low-cost<br>hydroelectricity and a location that was<br>serviced by four railways at its peak<br>Hamilton in the the 50s was responsible<br>for over 50 percent of shipping on the<br>Great Lakes all coming through the port<br>of Hamilton<br>and by the end of World War II Hamilton<br>was emerging as a Powerhouse with<br>virtually every major U.S Manufacturing<br>Company having a presence in our city in<br>fact one of my predecessors back in the<br>1940s was quoted as follows saying the<br>following in every home in the Dominion<br>of Canada you will find at least one<br>product made in Hamilton<br>now<br>I was first asked to speak to you this<br>evening about our renewal and our<br>revitalization and to answer a number of<br>questions regarding Economic Development<br>and the comeback of our municipality<br>60 years ago we were a city that really<br>rested on our Loyals we never imagined<br>that our large employers would ever<br>leave<br>Hamilton's non-residential to<br>residential tax ratio was approximately<br>three to one so for every dollar we were<br>taking in from residents we were getting<br>three in from industry<br>a great problem to have as a city we<br>simply couldn't spend that much tax<br>revenue and for years there was<br>virtually no tax increases to our<br>residents<br>to give you an indication of how big the<br>economy was then<br>just our two steel mills alone employed<br>over 35 000 people and that's without<br>the supply chain<br>but growth and development weren't<br>priorities for our forefathers they<br>didn't care what would drive the economy<br>in the years ahead or they didn't come<br>they didn't even seem to need that we<br>would need to develop business Parks<br>their major highways so it's kind of<br>like the scenario with General Motors in<br>Chrysler seven years ago in the Great<br>Recession residents can basically<br>considered Hamilton is too big to fail<br>yet we did<br>so what was the Catalyst for the<br>well we know that Tide and Time wait for<br>no man by the turn of the Millennium we<br>had actually slipped from first to worst<br>in the country the majority of large U.S<br>subsidiaries had closed and Consolidated<br>their operations with the U.S plants and<br>our non-residential to residential tax<br>ratio actually flipped so uh this<br>resulted in leaving the taxpayers having<br>to Bear the burden of tax revenue<br>because we had lost so much industry<br>still remained an economic driver for us<br>it was no longer our biggest employer<br>and what was once the most Diversified<br>economy in the Canada Hamilton was now a<br>city dependent on only a few a few<br>Industries<br>the other major Catalyst was<br>amalgamation of Hamilton and this is<br>something you might find very<br>interesting<br>in Ontario<br>municipalities and it's actually thrill<br>Canada municipalities are a creature of<br>the province we really don't have a lot<br>of say in decisions that are made so<br>with the stroke of the pin the<br>provincial Premier actually Amalgamated<br>the six municipalities that made upgrade<br>at Hamilton into one city and that<br>became the city of Hamilton<br>we went to one official plan<br>one zoning bylaw one planning department<br>one city manager and one mayor<br>and what the public really applied was<br>the fact which went from 78 politicians<br>to 15 counselors so very much<br>streamlined compared to what it was and<br>this really made a difference for us<br>when we were six municipalities making<br>up greater Hamilton if we had a plant<br>location in one municipality the next<br>day I had the other five Mayors on the<br>phone asking me one when a an industry<br>or a company was coming to their<br>municipality<br>but since the amalgamation one win one<br>one plant location anywhere in our<br>municipality is a win for everybody and<br>it's really seemed to make a difference<br>for us<br>what was the key factors to the the<br>immense success we've had over the last<br>uh five to ten years<br>I'd like to take the credit for this but<br>unfortunately it's the whole community<br>that deserves this<br>without our residents our business and<br>our education all pulling together the<br>results we've we've seen wouldn't be<br>impossible and let me just show you some<br>of the rankings we've had in the last<br>couple of years<br>here you can see that last year we were<br>rated the fastest growing economy at 2.5<br>percent we believe we're going to be the<br>fastest growing again this year we were<br>ranked the number one city in Canada for<br>the second consecutive year and<br>attracting industry and Commercial<br>development and we were rated the best<br>place in Ontario to invest over the next<br>five years these are rankings we would<br>have only dreamed about a decade ago<br>so again what were the keys one of them<br>was that we went back to Economic<br>Development funds we focused on the<br>basics and one of the most important of<br>those basics<br>was making sure that we were cost<br>competitive particularly compared to our<br>uh the 800 pound gorilla that lives to<br>our East and I'm not talk and here I'm<br>talking about the city of Hamilton and<br>not it's uh not the mayor of Toronto<br>we wanted to demonstrate value for the<br>investment dollar be it industrial or<br>residential<br>and this is uh again really just all<br>about being competitive<br>you can see the these sample housing<br>here in in the slide in front of you up<br>in the top Corner that White House the<br>that price a price for a house in<br>Hamilton would be 400 000 450 000 for<br>that house in Toronto the equivalent<br>house would be over a million dollars<br>probably 1.2 1.3<br>so all of a sudden<br>um we were a very cost alternative to<br>what was a very expensive and congested<br>City in Toronto and we've seen a big<br>migration out outward<br>in fact last year two out of every five<br>new home sales were the GTA greater<br>Toronto area residents<br>um<br>we also worked on planning for uh for<br>Superior Transportation here you can see<br>a second gold trading gold station stop<br>this is our Rapid Transit we now have<br>two lines coming into Hamilton whereas<br>ten years ago we only had one again this<br>is we're seeing more of an out migration<br>of not only residents but we're also<br>seeing a lot of businesses into our<br>areas<br>we also focused on attracting and<br>targeting research institutes and Center<br>of Excellence no longer is cheap power<br>the magnet to uh to attract business and<br>industry it really is an applied<br>research and research institutions and<br>centers of excellence we focus on<br>seamless customer service delivery and<br>what's really important is we're really<br>trying to build our skilled labor force<br>uh I was actually in a a meeting in<br>Minneapolis Minnesota back in June and<br>Minneapolis Minnesota has has one goal<br>to have the best Workforce in the in the<br>United States and they are putting tons<br>of money into that and it is really<br>business uh<br>business retention and expansion is uh<br>is probably where 80 of our efforts go<br>because that's quite frankly where 80 of<br>your growth comes from<br>attraction is uh there's a lot of<br>Attraction there's a lot of competition<br>when you're attracting Industries but<br>with working with your existing<br>companies we find that gives us the<br>biggest payoff<br>we have a very aggressive corporate<br>calling program here in Hamilton Ontario<br>we visit 300 companies uh per year<br>including our top 100 and we use<br>Salesforce as our CRM so we have current<br>files and up-to-date information our<br>entire industrial and business space<br>we also developed some unique incentive<br>programs both in our urban renewal<br>section where we are seeing<br>revitalization of our downtown<br>but also we have a very creative program<br>it's a leads grant program where we<br>refund the costs of certification and<br>the conversion to buildings that are<br>leadership that are leaders in energy<br>and environmental design and it's making<br>our companies greeners and again more<br>costs and competitive<br>just give me a second to catch my breath<br>foreign<br>so we've really focused on on teamwork<br>this is uh we're really very unique in<br>this way<br>we're one of the first municipalities to<br>Institute an integrated model for<br>economic development and business<br>related divisions<br>so you can see that we have building<br>Economic Development growth management<br>parking bylaw Services planning and<br>tourism and culture<br>this is a model that's been very good<br>and very successful for us we noticed a<br>number of things but right off the bat<br>communication increased exponentially we<br>were no longer operating in silos<br>approvals and permit process were<br>streamlined and accelerated and the real<br>benefit of this is problems were solved<br>immediately because the directors of<br>each one of those divisions we all sit<br>at the same management table<br>and we can make decisions very quickly<br>and speed up processes and accelerate<br>approvals an unexpended benef actually<br>an unexpected benefit of this is we<br>became so successful in this that the<br>other departments in the city like<br>finance and legal services and real<br>estate all wanted to be part of uh of<br>this uh this new team<br>and we meet collectively on a monthly<br>basis<br>and boy uh we are really starting to get<br>efficient<br>and let me uh let me give you an<br>indication of how efficient that's<br>becoming<br>what you can see here on this graph is<br>our building permits so for the last<br>three or four years we've broken up over<br>a billion dollars in in our building<br>permits and this year we're on track to<br>break a billion again so that'll be four<br>of the last five years that we've<br>exceeded over a billion dollars in our<br>total building permits Mississauga which<br>is a community of 800 000 people<br>adjacent right to the city of Toronto<br>and home to Toronto's uh sorry home to<br>the nation's biggest airport not even<br>close to us in terms of of how well<br>we're performing there<br>um<br>one of the uh one of the biggest uh<br>issues we had to deal with was to<br>diversify our economy again you recall<br>that I had mentioned our economy was<br>very well Diversified but then we lost<br>all of it so we've really focused on<br>trying to uh increase the the numbers<br>and different types of companies that we<br>have in our community<br>and focusing on our inherent strains we<br>weren't trying to start from scratch we<br>worked with what we had and did it work<br>you bet it that today Hamilton once<br>again has the most Diversified economy<br>in the country so<br>um<br>let me just show you some of the other<br>big hits we've had so uh Canada Bread<br>was our one of our first big hits It's<br>the largest commercial Bakery in North<br>America it has um<br>approximately<br>um 400 000 square feet 350 employees and<br>uh it's over 110 million dollar<br>investment<br>here you can see four companies recently<br>just uh expanded in our area the top is<br>in the left hand top left-hand Corners<br>jagerman water Digger Water Systems out<br>of France it's 250 000 square foot<br>manufacturing facility and this is their<br>uh Canadian headquarters as well<br>um they are so busy they have work for<br>the next 15 years actually in terms of<br>their order books beside them you can<br>see activation Labs uh this is the their<br>250 000 square foot headquarters in the<br>center for the Major Reese uh testing<br>regarding and they test everything from<br>minerals and Mining<br>um to uh to food processing and I<br>actually believe the nearest location<br>for you would be an operation they have<br>in Australia they are worldwide and a<br>very rapidly growing company<br>Navistar down in the uh in the bottom<br>left-hand Corner uh we lost them back in<br>the late 70s they are back this is their<br>Eastern Canada and Northeastern uh and<br>Canadian uh distribution center it's a<br>280 000 square foot facility and a<br>state-of-the-art a warehousing operation<br>and the building in the far corner is<br>our Union Gas these are natural gas<br>suppliers for for southern Ontario and<br>this is their uh this is now their uh<br>Southern Ontario headquarters<br>this is the big home run this was the<br>Grand Slam for us Maple Leaf Foods it is<br>a 500 000 square foot<br>uh 450 million dollar<br>meat processing plan so there's no<br>Slaughter and there's no rendering this<br>is the meat processing and packaging and<br>this facility has been designed to<br>compete internationally now when I was<br>talking with the the uh the VP who's<br>responsible for this plant I'd assumed<br>that when he said it was going to be<br>competing internationally he was talking<br>about the U.S<br>in fact it isn't this is going to be<br>with the new EU agreement between Canada<br>and the European Union<br>this facility will be primarily<br>packaging producing product not only for<br>Canada but for the year uh European<br>Union<br>and when fully operation it's going to<br>be approximately 900 employees in this<br>plant and um it's just about complete<br>we're looking at the ribbon-cutting<br>what we've also seen accompany the in<br>the industrial and the commercial growth<br>is uh is development in our downtown<br>core we had three new hotels open in the<br>last year this is the new Hilton<br>Homewood Suites what we've also seen is<br>the University becoming a big partner in<br>city building here<br>McMaster is one of four Canadian<br>universities in the top 100 and has a<br>medical program that's known worldwide<br>the McMaster downtown Hamilton Health<br>Campus is a huge investment by the<br>municipal both by McMaster and also by<br>the municipality we put 20 million<br>dollars into this project it's almost<br>complete it's opening in Spring of next<br>year and this is immediately across the<br>and some of our older buildings which<br>would have we would have seen demolition<br>in years past have now been restored<br>this is a list of the Lister block it<br>was built in the 1920s it's home to<br>three City departments so we no longer<br>are releasing off of uh private<br>developers these are all accommodated<br>with a city-owned building and there's<br>residents there's a commercial and<br>restaurants in the the main floor here<br>so<br>um<br>how long does one of the questions that<br>was asked is how long does this renewal<br>take for Hamilton well it's I can tell<br>you it's still very much a work in<br>progress but basically 15 years and and<br>four councils and we are really now on a<br>roll<br>let me just back up a second uh one of<br>the things I failed to mention was to<br>talk about our Council support<br>there's no way that we could have<br>accomplished anything without the<br>financial contribution we had an<br>increase to our budget of approximately<br>one and a half million and the moral<br>support of our elected officials which<br>actually became contagious the more<br>Hamilton started to see results in wins<br>and growth<br>we also started to uh have the federal<br>and the provincial governments now want<br>a piece of the action and we've got a<br>number of projects uh jointly between<br>the city the The Province and the um and<br>the federal government uh as a result of<br>the success that we've seen in the LA in<br>the last uh four to five years<br>so uh how did you uh one of the<br>questions that we have here is how did<br>you ensure support and participation<br>from the community<br>well it began with uh an extensive<br>public consultation on the economic<br>development strategy<br>what happened is that this strategy we<br>took it out to the community and we<br>almost we spent just about close to a<br>year<br>developing the strategy we wanted to<br>make sure that the community would take<br>ownership and the best way to do that<br>was to have them evolved from day one<br>we developed realistic metrics to<br>measure our performance and reported<br>these annually to Council in the<br>community<br>I have myself I have an annual lunch<br>meeting and a tour of our new<br>developments with the editor-in-chief of<br>our local newspaper<br>I also write a monthly column in their<br>newspaper and I'm a once a month<br>participant on the local am talk radio<br>show<br>both of which prevent me with the<br>opportunity to explain exactly why and<br>what we're doing in the economic<br>development area and why it is so<br>important to community<br>as I mentioned as we began to generate<br>wins and successes it created a buzz in<br>the community all of a sudden we had<br>momentum and credibility and everybody<br>was on board for example right now<br>we have 15 new condo Towers under<br>construction in our downtown core<br>that would have been Pure Fantasy uh 10<br>or 15 years ago that we would have seen<br>that kind of growth<br>the other question I'd have here is is<br>there anything you would have done<br>differently yes we would have started<br>earlier and we would have acquired<br>employment lands in strategic locations<br>you know what they say about land God<br>so Hamilton how can Hamilton New Zealand<br>learn from his namesake so a few lessons<br>from us change is not necessary as<br>change is not easy but it is necessary<br>and everybody needs to be focused and<br>committed on a strategic plan for growth<br>and economic development<br>again I don't want to sound like a<br>broken record but you know focus on your<br>Economic Development funds at mentals<br>don't give any any company or a person<br>or reason why not to invest in your<br>community<br>build on your inherent strains we didn't<br>start our sectors from scratch we worked<br>with what we had and really developed<br>the sectors that way<br>another<br>practice of ours is we with the<br>exception of our tourism Department we<br>do not print literature we drive<br>everything to our website<br>and made it mobile friendly we have a<br>full-time full-time staff member who<br>works on our regular on our website<br>daily and she's dedicated to it to our<br>website at our back office functions uh<br>business events there's we find want the<br>most up-to-date information as quickly<br>as possible and let me give you a good<br>example of a partnership with our real<br>estate board we have an interface<br>between their system and our website and<br>everyone every evening between midnight<br>and eight o'clock all the<br>non-residential properties and buildings<br>so<br>natural features uh is very important<br>for us even though we're a steel town a<br>lot of you may not believe that but it<br>is a major contributor to our quality of<br>life we found today that younger<br>Generations don't want to commute to a<br>large city instead they prefer a city<br>where you can cycle walk and be close to<br>to work and home and the outdoors<br>what I was looking at Hamilton New<br>Zealand on the internet and particularly<br>on your City website<br>uh what a beautiful place do you live in<br>an absolute Paradise<br>and um I don't know who wouldn't want to<br>live in your city and if it's you have<br>the same relationship with Auckland as<br>we do with Toronto uh certainly the<br>quality of life would be superior uh to<br>that of the larger City we are finding<br>right now more and more people from<br>Toronto are leaving the congestion and<br>the expense and the uh the sheer cost of<br>living a living in Toronto and they're<br>moving this way<br>a lot of people you know in in certainly<br>in in Southern Ontario I don't realize<br>that Hamilton Ontario for example we<br>have more waterfalls more trees more<br>trails and more Parks than any other<br>city in the country so we've really<br>tried to make it a a part of our brand<br>uh how important is it to have local<br>Council buy-in again as a previously<br>addressed it's absolutely essential that<br>you have local Council on your side<br>but you have to earn it last year we<br>received our accredited Economic<br>Development organization we were the<br>first municipality in Canada to get this<br>designation and it's very similar to the<br>iso process<br>but this is something that our Council<br>was very proud of that we went through<br>this year-long process to get this<br>designation and it comes from the<br>international Economic Development<br>Council in Washington<br>so after we got that I I guess it kind<br>of forgave us for that small fire back<br>in 1812.<br>one of the things we do and work on in a<br>guy that's part of our business<br>retention and expansion efforts is we<br>get the mayor and counselors on the city<br>hall and into our business parks in our<br>corporate calling program wherever<br>possible if the mayor's schedule permits<br>we bring the mayor along with us when we<br>see one of our larger Industries and<br>some of our smaller ones as well and<br>also we bring the board counselor<br>we find that the businesses want to show<br>off their operations to their elected<br>officials and to bend their ears on<br>issues that are they're important to<br>them as taxpayers<br>we also instituted a business<br>appreciation program three years ago and<br>what we do is we recognize a small<br>company and a large company in every one<br>of our Awards the companies presented<br>with a certificate of recognition from<br>the mayor as well as a photo that was<br>framed and and delivered to their<br>organized to their offices<br>and then we take a two-page spread in<br>the newspaper showing all the award<br>winners in each one of the awards uh I<br>can tell you uh for a project that is a<br>very small cost this has a big return<br>so finally the the last uh Point here uh<br>question was how can we go about<br>defining or redefining our identity in<br>New Zealand<br>again just some quick points don't be<br>something you're not what it makes<br>Hamilton New Zealand unique and the best<br>location to work live and pray uh play<br>uh so you're not Auckland can that be an<br>advantage well for us in our example<br>with Toronto it's a big plus for us we<br>don't aspire to be like Toronto we don't<br>want to be expensive and congested and<br>neither to the people in the companies<br>that are working here<br>be like Minneapolis in my comment about<br>how they are striving to be the best<br>Workforce in in the United States if you<br>can be the best for Workforce and have<br>the best Workforce in New Zealand don't<br>worry business and investment will<br>follow you you don't have to go chasing<br>them<br>um what you're seeing here is our uh is<br>there a new stadium next year Southern<br>Ontario is hosting the Pan American<br>Games those are the countries from North<br>America Central America and South<br>America<br>and Hamilton was with our new state it<br>was actually we're going to be hosting<br>all of the uh the soccer games which<br>we've confident countries like Argentina<br>and Brazil and Mexico we're going to<br>have it be friends in for some exciting<br>entertainment next year but this is also<br>the home to our Canadian football team<br>and when I was looking up at the<br>Hamilton New Zealand website I saw that<br>you have a rugby team<br>by the name of the Hamilton Tigers so I<br>thought you would like to see the logo<br>the name of our our Canadian Football<br>League<br>team and it's been around actually since<br>1930s and here we are another one of our<br>similarities the Hamilton Tiger Cats<br>so with that I'm just about ready to<br>wrap up one of the things I think we<br>should maybe consider uh investigating<br>as we move forward we have sister cities<br>in Italy Japan China the United States<br>but most of those were done on on<br>political or or Community type<br>relationships<br>we see a lot of similarities between<br>Hamilton New Zealand and ourselves and<br>particularly in some of the the<br>universities the agriculture the applied<br>sciences and I think this is something<br>worth some investigation so uh hopefully<br>we can keep our lines of communication<br>uh going and right now I think Nicola we<br>should have our uh our ambitious uh City<br>video ready to go and hopefully we can<br>see that right now thank you very much<br>okay thank you Neil<br>um I apologies for over running slightly<br>everyone a few technical difficulties<br>and so on but we do have time for<br>questions from the floor<br>so there's a couple of microphones just<br>floating around if you've got a question<br>please put your hand up in if you could<br>tell who it's directed to either me Neil<br>in Canada or Andrew Natalie so has<br>anyone got a first question okay<br>question in the front here<br>before I might as well go first then I'm<br>not sure exactly who's best place to<br>answer this question but what do you<br>think the impact on lifestyle will be in<br>Hamilton as population grows the city<br>boundaries do not grow to a proportional<br>extent and therefore the density of<br>housing increases<br>so probably one for you Natalie I think<br>first oh Andrew do you want to go<br>I I think it'll be fantastic I think um<br>as long as you stick the density where<br>it's where it's supposed to go so in the<br>CBD or around the CBD in key notable<br>points<br>um<br>rototonin being a an obvious example<br>with that new town center being built<br>Maybe<br>um<br>just those other areas around nodal<br>points So within walking distance to<br>amenity that's going to be fantastic<br>Suburbia will still be Suburbia and<br>that'll be great as well it's good to<br>have a good mix though but you do want<br>the the density in those key areas<br>I don't know if that answers your<br>question okay thank you um<br>maybe one more question before we close<br>okay Linda<br>Koto thank you everyone for your<br>presentations it was really interesting<br>um I was fascinated by Andrew the images<br>that you showed of densities in cities<br>and these beautiful places that are very<br>expensive to live in<br>and I'm worried about the development of<br>inner city Hamilton that pushes out the<br>people who need to live in ethnicity the<br>poor those people who need to live in<br>low-cost housing so how will we do that<br>in terms of high density that's<br>affordable for the people who aren't<br>rich<br>yeah that's a that's a really good<br>question and interestingly I I think the<br>high density and medium density that<br>starts off around those areas they don't<br>start out as being really expensive what<br>you'll find is the good quality high<br>density like I showed you in those the<br>second couple of slides they are the<br>expensive but they get expensive<br>the bad quality high density that stays<br>cheap so it's about developing good<br>quality density and it will be cheap to<br>not cheap but affordable to start with<br>and as the city grows and expands out<br>um<br>you will yeah you will get those good<br>quality developments going up in price I<br>guess<br>okay thanks for your questions everyone<br>I'm conscious we've all got better days<br>to go too<br>I I think it's going to be really<br>important going forward thinking about<br>the uh that there's going to be declines<br>in the younger but you know the youngest<br>population the children and massive<br>increases at older ages that our housing<br>is built uh so that you know when you've<br>got so many older people they're not<br>going to be tricking up great big<br>stories so you have to think really<br>carefully about this high density but<br>there's also you know a lot of high<br>density goes up and you want to make<br>sure that those are accessible and also<br>the ability of people to move around the<br>city the transport will need to take<br>account of their aging population as<br>well<br>just wanted to add one other thing to<br>that as well um the houses that are<br>being built at the moment that<br>um a lot of the houses in the northern<br>suburbs about 220 square meters Plus or<br>so as our population ages we're not<br>going to need a four or five bedroom 200<br>square meter house what we're going to<br>need is smaller houses smaller is also<br>okay thank you everyone<br>um the lecture will be available on the<br>University's iTunes you channel in about<br>two weeks time I'd now like to invite<br>the acting Vice Chancellor Professor<br>Alistair Jones back to the stage for<br>uh
