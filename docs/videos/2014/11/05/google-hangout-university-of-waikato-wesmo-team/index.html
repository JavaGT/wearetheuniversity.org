We spoke with two talented University of Waikato mechanical engineering students who, along with their small team, have designed and built their own racing car for the International Formula SAE- a race - all on a student budget.<br><br>Students, Todd Carswell and Josh McIntyre, are part of the "WESMO" team of mechanical and electrical engineering students. In the 2013 race the team placed 6th, which puts them at number 87 in the world (out of over 600 universities).<br><br>In this Hangout (Hosted by ScienceAlert) the boys share their tips on what it takes to build your own car race-track ready car, where to source parts from and the engineering basics you need to know.<br><br>To learn more about studying engineering at the University of Waikato,

everyone Welcome to our hangout today<br>I'm Fiona from science alert and we are<br>joined by some very talented mechanical<br>engineering students from the University<br>of wado in New Zealand and they're going<br>to be teaching us how to build our own<br>race car well some of the some of the<br>basics So today we're joined by Todd<br>cwell hi<br>Todd<br>hello and McIntyre hey Jos um they're<br>both from the wmo team which is made up<br>of mechanical and electrical engineering<br>students from wado uh and so they've<br>built a race car which is capable of<br>going Zer to 100 kilometers an hour in<br>under four seconds and it can also reach<br>160 kilm an hour which is pretty pretty<br>impressive makes me feel bad about my my<br>mechanical engineer achievements um but<br>they've been racing in the formula SAA<br>competition um which is austral Asia and<br>they placed six last year and um they're<br>about to get ready to race again this<br>year in December which is pretty<br>exciting um we want you guys to ask your<br>questions while we're chatting so we're<br>on the<br>hash hangout um and you can also ask<br>your questions in the YouTube comments<br>below so tell me Todd and Josh you're a<br>student team which is pretty impressive<br>and you built a race car of your own<br>what what does that involve how do you<br>build a race car<br>well um it's a very big process um first<br>is really just a really big learning<br>curve um a race car is expect there's a<br>lot of components involved in a lot of<br>theories a lot<br>ofes um<br>so more the young members of the team we<br>try to get behind a race car the reasons<br>they run well the reasons they run fast<br>and then like sort of how on manufacture<br>them then um once you sort of get over<br>the learning curve is learning all the<br>rules for our specified<br>competition um and then I guess once<br>once you got all that done you're ready<br>to start designing your own car yeah um<br>for our competition there's about 150<br>pages of rules<br>wow yeah um and they involve safety they<br>involve restrictions on engine size and<br>just everything specified um you really<br>need to get your head around that and<br>you need to understand what sort of guy<br>you're designing them for yeah um and<br>also the style of<br>racing our racing is quite tight and<br>Technical more like go-kart racing then<br>actually Fallout Speed Racing um and<br>then sort of you base your design of<br>your car on the application really um<br>and then yeah you start you look to see<br>what else is around you what's what's<br>working well like which cars are doing<br>well and what have they what sort of<br>what we can<br>make time yeah imagine that would be<br>tough when you're studying yeah yeah<br>yeah um yeah so and then design up to<br>these things and then the design stage a<br>lot of back and forth like yeah like<br>Josh is saying if you can do it if you<br>can't do it some materials if you can't<br>once you have all the design finalized<br>you move on to the<br>manufacturing and so that's that's<br>getting everything made for the car<br>assembly and then you go testing stage<br>and then of course um onto the race<br>eventually wow so would you kind of talk<br>talking about the design would you sort<br>of go backwards from the applications a<br>little bit so work out you know what the<br>rules are what the cars needed to do and<br>then work out from there you know use<br>your engineering skills to kind of work<br>out the best design for it yeah pretty<br>much uh of what we have done look at<br>last and Bas a lot of our design<br>but um obviously trying to keep the new<br>2014<br>rules a lot of big design Chang based on<br>the last year yeah huge design Chang we<br>we took last and which was a very very<br>good car and then did a lot of testing<br>with it and we saw through the<br>recommendations from last year what was<br>sort<br>of the downsides of the the things we<br>can improve um and then we' targeted all<br>those<br>um the design this year each each year<br>your tell me a about the um the the sort<br>of the race what's the r i mean you can<br>see the footage in the background um<br>what's the RAC tracker like how long is<br>it and what are kind of some of the<br>obstacles yeah I guess RAC trck is a lot<br>of cones basically like a AO cross which<br>Technical and you really need to have<br>good acceleration and<br>breaking um that's really big work on<br>driver of tunes and a lot of high<br>spe um but at competition what we have<br>is a endurance event a figure of<br>eight and acceleration acceleration and<br>um autocross which is one as around the<br>track and um<br>sorry around all these events<br>yeah and and how is it only student<br>teams<br>entering yeah yeah um so it's a Student<br>Competition there's actually eight of<br>them around the world and we<br>compete um and so from New Zealand if<br>you're listening in from New Zealand<br>there's ockland Canterbury and us and<br>there's about 20 or so Australian<br>universities and<br>Inter that's so cool I love it um and so<br>tell me when you talk about<br>manufacturing the parts um we'll get to<br>some of the specifications and budget<br>limits soon we've got a a few questions<br>on how much it costs but how do you kind<br>of find the parts did were you taking<br>spare parts of other cars or were they<br>custom built for your own race<br>car um most of stuff on the cars all C<br>and I guess like to keep the budget we<br>have to use some parts from last year<br>it's just so<br>expensive but all of all the parts we<br>try and design inh housee and we try and<br>get them made in house as well but at<br>times it's just too hard to do it we<br>have to find EXT<br>yeah yeah absolutely and we've got a<br>question from Marcus who I had a a<br>similar question he was wondering if you<br>use all new parts or some secondhand<br>parts but also how much did it cost to<br>make the car overall would you estimate<br>yeah good question Marcus um I guess a<br>lot of the parts are new but some parts<br>differential are from mesda so they are<br>second um radiator as well radiator as<br>well<br>Master cylinders yeah yeah so we try we<br>try use as best possible but then of<br>course you know the cost sort of gets<br>out of hand um but overall if we to put<br>a number on it it's it's really<br>difficult to put a number on it and like<br>we say it's a progression from last year<br>we' Reus hi Parts but um for<br>about um to build a car yeah which is<br>pretty good right I mean how much would<br>yeah I can yeah I feel like I can<br>imagine that would be it would be pretty<br>expensive so you've done okay are there<br>any budget constraints for the<br>competition that other universities have<br>to adhere to um no there's no overall<br>rule on it um it's pretty much as much<br>as you can Source from the University or<br>SP um so other unities often get the<br>bigger budget um as sort of what you get<br>make of your situation um and of course<br>SP we putting a big<br>push and um anything you get from<br>industry or local companies really helps<br>out the yeah absolutely I can imagine um<br>we've got a question from Brandon who<br>wants to modify a 1992 MR2 turbo I don't<br>know what that is hope you guys know<br>what that<br>is so would you what would you suggest<br>as the first things to modify and what<br>guys<br>drive um well depends<br>what that context before I love<br>it to make it faster you want to make it<br>breathe better You' be looking at uh<br>intake system and uh um a new exhaust um<br>if you want to spend a B Money big<br>turos bger injectors<br>things maybe an<br>aftermarket or<br>on the<br>car nice um so you think it's worth<br>fixing<br>project um and tell us a bit about I<br>mean you guys you modify your own cars<br>at home like how how did you get<br>started um for me I I had friends that<br>were into it when we were a bit younger<br>um and sort of used start really I'm not<br>sure turned into a bit of a hobby and<br>then a bit of a passion from there yeah<br>same with me I worked on my friends<br>Cadillacs and Mikes and just fix upik<br>and all sorts of things like that and<br>obviously my own car so yeah yeah oh<br>nice it's a good passion um and do you<br>do you both study mechan mechanic can't<br>speak mechanical engineering is that<br>right yeah yeah you got students there<br>are students who study electrical<br>engineering on the team as well I think<br>but what made you guys want to get into<br>study mechanical engineering I guess for<br>on things like cars and motorbikes and<br>to which is<br>tough um I also had a pretty strong<br>physics and chemistry and um kind of a<br>mass background but more like a Hands-On<br>yeah kind of background yeah yeah for me<br>thing um it was quite strong in physics<br>and maths in high school um so it sort<br>of the right career I just want to do<br>engineering and then sort of once you<br>get here you get the first year to<br>decide what you want to do you do the<br>broad engineering um major and<br>mechanical same it's a really broad<br>broad subject covers a lot of areas and<br>it just really interested me yeah<br>absolutely well it sounds like it's been<br>pretty fun um and how many students are<br>on the racing team with you guys um all<br>up is um field this year and our wi team<br>about 15 to 16 students and they're<br>mostly mechanical engineering as well<br>there's third and second years but we<br>also have uh student that's studying<br>management yeah so um it's a it's lots<br>of the top teams uh a broad range of<br>students you get um marketing students<br>that often help with the sponsorship and<br>The Branding of the team but then you<br>graphic designers like that and that's<br>really to<br>push that's really cool yeah as<br>Engineers um our management size skills<br>exactly up to stretch<br>sometimes really good<br>to and it's good for them as well a lot<br>doing thing gives real world application<br>to your degree and yeah yeah it's pretty<br>cool um so tell me about some of the<br>rules and restrictions in terms of the<br>car and the actual engineering of the<br>car uh that are part of the formula SE<br>um what you know what do you have to<br>adhere to what size can the wheels be<br>what size can the engine be that kind of<br>thing um yeah so like what Todd said<br>before I think there's about 150 pages<br>on the ru yeah you need to recite them<br>all now<br>pretty much but I guess the main<br>constraints that we have as a team are<br>engine size um and the engine has to be<br>under 600 CC and it has to be um four<br>stroke and internal<br>combustion um and yeah there's all<br>restrictions on CH SI we can't off the<br>top of our head um and it also has to be<br>an open world cut so um there needs to<br>be a tennis ball needs better to go<br>around each wheel without hitting any of<br>Bodywork wow yeah and you also have to<br>run a 20 mil a<br>restrictor so respect air com engine and<br>overall power you can make just to keep<br>it more safe I guess these cars already<br>pretty quick be a lot faster without it<br>yeah that that's sounds pretty cool um<br>we have a question from Lewis does the<br>race car utilize wave turning and how do<br>you model the exhaust for the best<br>torque band<br>um good question difficult question um<br>it's uh what we've tried to do this year<br>and we haven't been able get the<br>software working but there's a program<br>called<br>virtual and um this is a simulation<br>software which you import the parameters<br>of your engine and you can simulate what<br>how your work and the<br>talk a lot in exha wiing is header link<br>that's the headers that run off the<br>exhaust of the car and where the<br>collector is located come<br>together moving that location really<br>changes the torque of your overall<br>engine but from what we've found of the<br>20 mil<br>aor um it's often hard this without the<br>simulation um because the air restrictor<br>restricts lots of the flow on the engine<br>sort yeah absolutely we we've um we've<br>had a question from Rusty now you<br>probably get this a lot so he said how<br>does building a race car relate to<br>mechanical engineering isn't that more<br>of a mechanics job um tell us a bit<br>about the some of the engineering<br>applications that that go into this yeah<br>so believe it or not it is not really a<br>mechanics job like we do a lot of hand<br>pulling<br>bols a lot of at the start we're most of<br>the componentry that goes on the car so<br>what we use is a program SW works and<br>what we do is 3D model all of the parts<br>in the car and we actually make like a<br>3D model of the car all together and so<br>from this yeah we just kind of I guess<br>design it yeah yeah<br>definitely I'd say I guess um like I was<br>saying earlier mechanical engineering is<br>so Broad and this comes under it up<br>anywhere in<br>industry building a car um actually<br>involves lots of the skills you use in<br>industry like you have to do all the<br>right drawings tolerances everything<br>like that and you have to<br>get um a mechanics job is more the<br>fixing up of things that have gone wrong<br>where the engineering side is more<br>designing it in the first place yeah I<br>think that's pretty cool and I mean um<br>when you talk about sort of 3D modeling<br>all the different parts which is really<br>cool do you then go on to print them is<br>that how they kind of created is that um<br>PDF and then these are sent off to our<br>suppliers or machinists<br>or we're not sort of 3D printing them<br>we're um we're kind of getting them<br>sorry bit of a bad question<br>yes that's<br>go um the C allows us to or the computer<br>AED design really allows us to build the<br>whole car on a computer and work on it<br>as a group so you can draw up and design<br>aart and then you can to the car on the<br>computer you can see that everything<br>fits and it's going to work together<br>nicely um there's also a thing called<br>FAA which is fin<br>El um and that allows you to add loads<br>and stres onto an item you've designed<br>and so you can see if the part's going<br>to break or if it's going to survive and<br>service um so those are really helpful<br>Tools in your designing and then what we<br>sort of do from there is we take these<br>drawings to a manufacturer where um from<br>this year you might see these<br>parts um this is our<br>Hub um so the wheel bolts onto here oh<br>nice yeah and these parts are actually<br>machined out of a solid block of<br>aluminum called a buet<br>block um and so pretty much that's how<br>they're made they're send to a CNC mil<br>or a CNC lathe and they are cut out of a<br>that's really cool and could someone at<br>home like if someone at home wanted to<br>develop their own race car would they<br>have access to the I mean what are these<br>programs can you download them would<br>they have access to be able to design<br>things like this yeah yeah I guess<br>there's a lot of like free edition but<br>itself is like a commercial kind of yeah<br>expensive phot<br>yeah but going to University a lot of<br>unties have a CAD program kind of like<br>sponsored I guess as a student addition<br>and it's just study mean do learn that<br>program yeah absolutely and is it<br>something that professional race car<br>race car builders would use as well is<br>that something You'<br>use they have a lot of their own<br>probably use their own software and not<br>really to anyone all the top ones you<br>know Formula One and<br>stuff definitely use a sort of software<br>to design and and simulate the cars nice<br>um Chris actually has a question about<br>the program so he says um is it more<br>comprehensive than engine analyzer Pro<br>uh and can you use um anti-reversion<br>Chambers in the exhaust to help increase<br>the draw past the Restriction plate<br>during<br>over sorry Chris I probably<br>that question for you I should talk<br>about the<br>stroke yeah yeah um we haven't actually<br>got it up and running yet we've had a<br>bit few problems with our our computer<br>and like that so I can't really answer<br>that question at the moment but from<br>what virtual for Strokers um really good<br>software but it's also um very expensive<br>um the only reason we got it was as an<br>sa team um they sponsor it to um so yeah<br>so we can't commment on the moment sorry<br>no that's fair enough and what about the<br>anti-reversion<br>chambers um same same scario I know<br>that's I know that is your favorite<br>topic to talk about<br>definitely but yeah same same thing so<br>you guys haven't used those um you<br>haven't used those in your car have you<br>um anti rsion Chambers no we haven't um<br>we're looking at changing the collector<br>location um on the exhaust too um the<br>verion and you move it<br>changes um but this year because we've<br>done a work on the engine um and change<br>the INE as well and that's still under<br>construction quite hard to engage have<br>on the exhaust so it's sort of we need<br>to get these finalized before we do<br>so yeah exactly yeah stay tuned for next<br>year and see how you go that'll be<br>awesome<br>um speaking of that do you guys report<br>back on your the things you've learned<br>to sort of help other student teams or<br>do you keep it quite secret within the<br>um<br>formula um there's definitely a bit of<br>secr especially from the top teams but<br>on the whole teams are usually pretty<br>it's it is a competition at the end of<br>the day and teams do try really hard and<br>compete but um the whole thing over<br>learning experience and teams usually<br>pretty nice last year competition broke<br>um Prof housing which means they lost<br>full drive to the<br>wheels and one of the other apart to<br>allow there's definitely the element<br>comp there's also also a lot of<br>friendliness and and yeah just<br>knowledge which which is awesome um and<br>you've got the upcoming race so are you<br>hoping to sort of achieve a certain<br>place how are you feeling your go<br>compared to last year<br>um it's kind of hard to know but we the<br>goal at the again place in the top um so<br>yeah hopefully hopefully we can place<br>well yeah last year's guys s the bar<br>very high again for us um yeah no we're<br>definitely to achieve a a top 10 finish<br>there's a lot of comp be reallyy that<br>that's awesome that's really exciting um<br>and we've had a question from Scott<br>about uh you know maybe you guys need a<br>world class driver who does Drive who<br>drives the car during the race and and<br>how do you know how do you pick backs<br>that's obviously a lot of pressure for<br>the driver yeah yeah so<br>competition drivers and all of those<br>drivers are actually part of our team<br>University so our drivers are St and one<br>of one<br>of and the rest<br>and um none of them<br>really say it's hard to find those at<br>University I guess but what we really<br>try to do is um try to do some driver<br>training and try to get them seat and<br>get as comfortable<br>as um we've<br>got we're talking about actually<br>driven and quite a bit of cting hope he<br>can really um help<br>dri um to yeah to<br>really Drive well yeah it's fantastic um<br>we have a question from Thomas did you<br>design is that like thing we use suuki<br>d6r so from so definitely don't use yeah<br>no motorbikes don't implenting something<br>like that would be<br>work um tell me tell me about some of<br>the parts of your car this year I mean<br>not without giving away too much<br>obviously because you're about to<br>compete um but how how much does it<br>weigh and and what are some of the<br>specifications you can tell<br>us yeah yeah it's not don't know the<br>exact over but um we're looking to cut<br>about 15 20 kgs out of last but this end<br>up with a total weight um fully ready<br>track ready um we about 235 kilos<br>M and other specification I guess we're<br>aiming for about 83 horsepower again um<br>we have modified the engine we're hoping<br>for more linear power and rather than<br>quite um yeah and we've got four new<br>suspension geometri this year and what<br>should help with and handling of the car<br>yeah abely the<br>UNS of the car so that's the weight<br>suspension um we've reduced that about<br>10% which should also help improve the<br>handling nice Yeah we actually had a<br>question from Lan about um chassis<br>geometry and how it affects<br>handling that something that's got an<br>impact a big impact for you guys yeah I<br>guess chess is probably number one for<br>your umal sness and so what a lot of<br>either a Chessie a steel chess which is<br>steel and tube and those are all tubes<br>that or you can go down a monoco kind of<br>style which is a carbon fiber and it's<br>all like a molded<br>tub um as for us to try<br>andove torsional stiffness the better it<br>is that video to handle the least it's<br>going to Turning um so for this<br>um the guys really designed it with<br>triangulation and mind all the members<br>of the chess meet at one point um and<br>also the like we were saying before has<br>been extensively with the element<br>analysis so this allowed us to load up<br>the Jess see where the weak points were<br>and then redesign it for that and um<br>this year we actually chassis from last<br>year um as they did it<br>good job with it last year so yeah yeah<br>very cool um and in terms of you know um<br>your favorite part of putting the car<br>together is it both of you are probably<br>different but is it designing it is it<br>trying to make a me budget um what's<br>what's your favorite part is it when you<br>finally get to racing on the track oh my<br>favorite part<br>is the entire project honest we're doing<br>lots lots of different things each day<br>know one day we might be side Works<br>doing the next day<br>work welding well the next day we're out<br>to fun fund the project through sponsors<br>project<br>no see you<br>the design<br>and I think finally seeing<br>your really really rewarding because of<br>that yeah yeah no that sounds awesome I<br>think it'd be very cool um I know we<br>were talking earlier that you guys spend<br>a lot of hours at the moment you're<br>doing like 80 to 100 hours a week on the<br>car pretty full<br>on Alan Chu has a question so um sorry<br>question from Preston he his university<br>has a new formula sa team do you have<br>any tips for success for someone who's<br>sort of doing it for the first time for<br>rookies yeah I guess<br>my um first time I guess try and just<br>get your car running try and get it<br>reliable and yeah try try and design it<br>so components don't break which is<br>easier said than done I guess yeah yeah<br>I'd<br>say there's lots of<br>electric which are really really<br>starting up teams<br>we had some Carol Smith like that really<br>good and yeah like Jos it runs and every<br>year build on it I think the key thing<br>is just if you've got a running car<br>you're going to keep keep the team<br>spirit<br>up yeah yeah absolutely I think that's<br>that's the main thing I guess keeping it<br>together and what happens to the car I<br>know you reuse Parts but at the end of<br>the race what happens to does it get<br>broken down or you keep it for next year<br>yeah we're trying<br>it down for shipping we<br>back um hopefully this year which we've<br>never had a chance to do in the past<br>is keep the car as a roll rolling car so<br>hopefully what they can do least is have<br>two cars drivable that way we can<br>like that and it's also um really<br>good anything so um so if if you sort of<br>if you keep two cars going um it's just<br>going to make it a whole e team and have<br>everything again and<br>can't work yeah absolutely I can imagine<br>you kind of want to tear it apart in<br>some<br>ways so tell me a bit about where your<br>Workshop is I mean where do you work and<br>and what are the tools like are these<br>tools that people could have access to<br>in their own home or do you really need<br>to have sort of a proper um stocked<br>Workshop to build a car like this um so<br>our workshops on the science and<br>engineering block um pretty much we have<br>normal tools that anyone can buy down at<br>their local car part shop I guess you<br>know we have um spanners<br>branches and drills but we don't really<br>have anything<br>we do have a a drill press um<br>but and like a<br>grinder but to do anything really you do<br>need<br>some um and we do have Workshop<br>facilities available to do that<br>work I think um you canot of those basic<br>tools it might mean more techical part<br>you're going to have<br>to<br>we yeah absolutely uh I mean what a what<br>are some of the benefits if people<br>wanted to build a car um at home you<br>know what what would you what are some<br>of the benefits of doing that as opposed<br>to kind of you know buying a car or what<br>are some of the benefits of even<br>upgrading your own car rather than just<br>buying buying one and a new one I guess<br>sa money at the end of the day<br>break I<br>think it really feels more personal I<br>think you enjoy it more and just say if<br>anything goes wrong you can replace it<br>lot of<br>hassle yeah absolutely and we got a<br>question from Thomas do you and again<br>this is a question that I don't<br>understand fully so I'm going to read it<br>out and hope that hope that my<br>mechanical engineering knowledge makes<br>sense um do you run a titanium flet or<br>do you use a flux capacitator to get<br>that um I don't think that's a serious<br>questions but that would be impressive<br>right<br>impressive if you did yeah I think that'<br>be pretty impressive I'd be I'd be I'd<br>that tell me tell me a bit about um what<br>the most useful tool for you guys is<br>that you use all the<br>time most useful it probably the<br>hammer I thought I thought you gonna say<br>something really exciting like a flux<br>capacitator or<br>something no um I think most important<br>basic toast is Len<br>Keys um which I think is really cool and<br>do most with<br>yourself yeah absolutely um and so talk<br>to me about the the race coming up what<br>event are you guys most looking forward<br>to do you have one that you feel like<br>you're going to really do well in I<br>think the the big one's always the<br>endurance um you have for the whole<br>competition it's all out of a thousand<br>points and so you have points awarded<br>for your um static event like<br>presentation and posting and design your<br>car have points for the dynamic event<br>for the race events we<br>described um I think the big one is<br>that's worth the most and that's where<br>all the cars not built up to scratch or<br>have weak<br>components runs for produ day that's the<br>that everyone's hanging out for really<br>yeah absolutely<br>um yeah<br>so that's that's it's a 30 lap<br>race and really it really just really T<br>your car and strength we and yeah nice<br>and and that's I guess where you really<br>kind of see if what you've come up with<br>in the lab and on the computer programs<br>and stuff really pays off when you get<br>out there definitely yeah absolutely<br>what what do you guys want to do when<br>you graduate I mean what's the ultimate<br>career do you both want to work in the<br>car<br>industry well I we don't really have<br>that much the<br>stream you can move you can<br>travel um both me and Todd actually had<br>jobs and we actually have it at the same<br>company so but definitely for me um I<br>guess<br>long-term I guess a job that challenges<br>me um was really<br>interesting yeah yeah I don't really<br>have field either um I guess is just<br>sort of should sort of go as it happens<br>you<br>know I would love to be in the car<br>industry and do sort of thing as<br>say I think really interesting and<br>challenging I think it's really<br>good yeah absolutely um and so what kind<br>of um skills have you built up so far<br>that you feel like would be valuable<br>from the competition I mean we talk a<br>lot about you know what are the real<br>applications of this how can you use it<br>but what are some of the things you've<br>taken away that you find will be really<br>useful I guess probably one of the<br>about we we're just crazy talking<br>and<br>Industry and even between ourselves I<br>think and any company is huge and often<br>um it's a soft skills like sending<br>emails<br>um on the phone yeah exactly and I think<br>even even though we've learned all these<br>technical skills um I think these ones<br>are the ones that really pay off in<br>industry and I think these are the ones<br>that um are really really<br>important yeah absolutely I mean and<br>it's something that I guess you don't<br>associate with Engineers sorry no<br>generally you have all the tech skills<br>and you learn you know all the science<br>behind it but I guess it's not something<br>that you use on a daily Bas it's<br>probably really exciting to practice<br>those have them proven yeah and and it's<br>know yeah definitely um we have a<br>question from Mato um can you talk about<br>some of the biggest differences in terms<br>of performance between the car that you<br>guys work on for Formula SAE um and a<br>Formula 1 race car I guess number one is<br>cost<br>Formula One um most of the components<br>cover<br>Millions teams have over $500<br>million the biggest really are in the<br>size of the car our cars a lot Sher and<br>um probably a lot skinnier as well than<br>and we also small tires um just the the<br>RAC tracks a lot different um the style<br>of racing formula 1's like big open<br>tracks the high speed with us sort of<br>racing more smaller in between all<br>across tracks so these cars are really<br>really designed for handling<br>acceleration and braking as the the main<br>of areas you know overall TR speed yeah<br>absolutely and in terms of I mean we<br>talk a lot about kind of trying to um<br>get electrical cars up to the<br>performance of race cars and even<br>regular cars on the road um what could<br>could you sort of integrate some of the<br>things that you've developed in the<br>system that you've got at the moment um<br>with a more sustainable system sort of<br>like a solar car or an electrical car<br>yeah in the competition there's actually<br>a new electrical division oh cool and<br>yeah yeah there about four cars last<br>year I think that they run alongside<br>Us in the separate<br>categories and so yeah there's bit it's<br>often cars are really really um they<br>quite heavy with all the and everything<br>like that but um the electric motor has<br>lots of and huge amounts of power off<br>the line so an<br>acceleration really really fast and um<br>because you can arrange the them you can<br>keep the mess<br>and you want so these cars are I think<br>they're really really being<br>based and um so so yeah what we've done<br>our it's mostly towards<br>the but um<br>definitely a huge area forcs and<br>solution absolutely and I guess you know<br>if they if they are engineered correctly<br>I mean to get the balance right and the<br>steering right do you do you think they<br>can be as powerful as the the race cars<br>that you guys are<br>sound no<br>definitely and there's huge potential<br>all the technology in them is still<br>um definitely huge potential for very<br>fast<br>car the number one Elric cars at the<br>moment and charge them and they<br>veryy yeah and I guess in the future is<br>probably an area I mean did you guys<br>learn about that in your lectures and<br>things of how to move it's probably<br>going to be a growth industry I guess<br>yeah yeah<br>definitely research at the moment they<br>just being approved all the time<br>could just get<br>B yeah absolutely I mean we yeah we and<br>we hear about you know student teams<br>actually a driving a lot of the<br>Innovation I mean um I know over in<br>Australia we've got some student teams<br>that are building really amazing solar<br>cars so it's nice to see students<br>getting out there and actually drivve in<br>the industry because I guess you're not<br>so focused on making money and um<br>actually experiment with things yeah why<br>un electric V too um solo race cars and<br>um electrical cars that have traveled<br>New Zealand yeah I remember they had<br>they had the one that went over Mount<br>Cook and everything it was crazy yeah<br>yeah yeah it's pretty impressive I mean<br>it's just amazing to see that you know<br>the these Technologies are coming<br>through would you personally want to<br>work on those types of electrical solar<br>cars or are you happy with<br>fuel that's a hard question I love the<br>picts but yeah I could definitely some<br>electri cars and<br>that sort of<br>Industry yeah absolutely um and what are<br>some of the skills that you would<br>recommend to um people who are thinking<br>about you know maybe they love cars<br>maybe they like science and they want to<br>get into a similar industry what are<br>some of the the skills that you think<br>they might need um and some of the tips<br>you might give them yeah I guess there's<br>skills that do need engineering but I<br>guess number one is getting your maths<br>and physics getting those academic<br>nailed down and do<br>well um the other one is just trying to<br>be a problem solver yeah really all<br>about and so just and<br>practice SKS on anything you know and<br>yeah just<br>try yeah um I think really willing learn<br>Engineers the industry is always<br>changing to always learning<br>always soling problem and so yeah I<br>think that sort ofion just enjoy it yeah<br>absolutely I think that's such a good<br>tip um and for you guys what's been the<br>best thing I mean obviously the changing<br>facet is pretty cool but what's the best<br>thing about studying engineering at<br>University of w Carter What are some of<br>the opportunities you've had um probably<br>summer job availability we have to do<br>a degree but what I found anyway is that<br>at WTO we we're just really<br>wanted and yeah just inviting<br>and yeah yeah um the engineering<br>department um which has it drawbacks but<br>not a bad thing we get really we really<br>get to know our really well because the<br>classes are quite smaller than other<br>un um and so that's good you get and I<br>Lear a lot better A lot of hands on<br>papers and a<br>car I think um really important<br>and yeah absolutely so what's left to do<br>I mean winding down kind of counting<br>down before the race what do you have to<br>do<br>now get all our<br>car um get a Ted yeah on Monday coming<br>we have to have a dino<br>CH all the engine and all the fuel and<br>the power um and then from that we'll go<br>on to a testing session where we'll try<br>and test the car see how it how it<br>handles and what things we need to<br>change um get the driver some time in<br>the in the new car and then yeah just<br>start preparing for competition yeah<br>yeah very cool and do you guys go over<br>to Melbourne for a little while before<br>and after the race or is it just you<br>know over for the weekend um no<br>definitely before we're heading there uh<br>third of December thir December and<br>that's week and a half out<br>from exciting Nicholas wants to know I<br>feel like this um is another question<br>for you guys especially um why why no<br>wings on your cars wouldn't that make it<br>go<br>faster um it's definitely an area being<br>researched into guy called Nicholas so<br>it might be that one asking the question<br>but um<br>um yeah um as as a whole our car we run<br>with the four-cylinder engine um you can<br>also run with a single Small Engine so<br>we have um we have a lot more power<br>available but that makes it a bit heav<br>um so overall um we're fine we get<br>enough grip mechanical grip and handling<br>enough power down out the wings at the<br>moment in the future there's definitely<br>room to the car but probably look at<br>going to a small L ch<br>and the on to gain<br>that at<br>the um overall designing and building a<br>massive process and the engineering and<br>science still relatively un so you can't<br>really take it like process but<br>defitely<br>that absolutely and are there any other<br>up incoming technologies that you guys<br>want to look into in the future that<br>aren't quite there yet that that maybe<br>you know out there watching who might<br>want to build a car might want to know<br>about um prin printing<br>yeah one of the emerging Technologies is<br>obviously 3D printing but there's also<br>this one called laser centering which<br>actually printing um steel yeah or<br>titanium and um they can make really<br>strong Parts but the great thing about<br>them they can make very intricate Parts<br>which are very hard to make otherwise um<br>and so doing these canot weight out<br>of um but there are also still such new<br>technology um the fatigue and sometimes<br>the strength sometimes quite brittle the<br>so um it's a difficult area because if<br>you put them into the car you're still<br>quite Unsure how it's going to act but<br>in the future there's room to use this<br>sort of<br>Technology yeah absolutely I I think<br>that you know that's obviously pretty<br>exciting that you guys can play around<br>with it<br>thank you so so much um I think we're<br>out of time but we had some great<br>questions and I hope that you guys<br>watching learned something and Todd and<br>Josh we didn't drive you crazy with too<br>questions um it was great but good luck<br>good luck in the race and we'll be<br>watching and um hopefully learning from<br>some of um your your successes and<br>finding out about how everything went uh<br>is there anything you guys want to add<br>or any messages for the the team who<br>might be<br>watching um just say thank you the<br>sponsors that have<br>really um and yeah I hope all the other<br>teams that are giv up competition are<br>going all right um look forward to see<br>you don't mean<br>that um yeah and thanks on the go<br>hangout been awesome it's been great<br>well thank you so much um if any of you<br>guys are interested in studying<br>engineering or want to find out more um<br>there are some links in the uh YouTube<br>description um to check out University<br>of w car they've got some Great Courses<br>and you guys can be on the wmo team too<br>which is pretty awesome so it's been so<br>great to talk to you both have a<br>wonderful day and we'll speak soon<br>awesome cheers lat bye the University
