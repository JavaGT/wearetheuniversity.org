Professorial Lecture.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>podcast with your basket and my basket<br>prosper as Peter has introduced I'm<br>Richard Blakey I'm the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and Enterprise<br>and it's my great pleasure to have<br>traveled from denan today to um<br>introduce our inaugural prophal lecture<br>speaker tonight but also very<br>importantly to award Professor Lisa<br>stamp the 2011 roath trust award and<br>Carl Smith medal from the University of<br>atago this is one of a number of<br>research medals that we award annually<br>at the University of atago and the ri<br>trust award and Carl Smith medal is<br>awarded specifically for researchers<br>between 2 and 10 years from uh<br>completion of their PHD studies and um<br>we have a long his history of people<br>being awarded this medal in the early<br>stages of their careers going on to<br>great things at the University and in<br>their future careers and it's very<br>pleasing to be able to combine this<br>award uh with the inaugural professorial<br>lecture for Professor Lisa stamp because<br>the um Award of uh a professorial<br>appointment at the University of attiga<br>is an extremely challenging process that<br>people have to go through it's um it's<br>not a promotion that we give out lightly<br>and it is to be celebrated that's why I<br>am here in my full academic regalia to<br>to celebrate uh this uh very very um<br>significant achievement and um I will<br>make the award to Professor stamp but<br>um<br>I should just say a few words about uh<br>sir Carl Smith who was uh a member of<br>the denan community for many many years<br>in the early and mid 20th centuries and<br>served for uh many years in fact decades<br>on the University Council and was a very<br>strong contributor and supporter of the<br>university and uh his support extended<br>to the formation of the roath trust<br>that's why there are two names the medal<br>is named after sir Carl Smith the award<br>of uh of fre value is um from the roath<br>trust he set this up to provide ongoing<br>support for activities and support for<br>research at the University of atago with<br>the name roath uh relating to the Family<br>Estate back in the home country and as<br>well as the award of a medal it is<br>traditional to award the recipient a<br>copy of a book a small little book that<br>uh sir Carl Smith wrote called New<br>Zealand from in to zed and I have to<br>tell Lisa it is in fact a used book a<br>secondhand book uh we this book has gone<br>out of print so there is a collection<br>held at the University and in fact there<br>are individuals who go around the Used<br>Book Sales finding additional copies so<br>that we have sufficient on reserve to<br>present at occasions like this I should<br>say yours has a a citation and a a<br>dedication in it that's completely<br>unrelated to this<br>award um the book so over time this book<br>is going to become uh a very sought<br>after by Rare book collectors and<br>recipients of the Carl Smith medal um it<br>may or may not be something that strikes<br>your fancy Lisa I uh read a review of<br>this book it is a humorous book that the<br>author kept updating after its first<br>version just after World War II until<br>the early<br>1960s it is a light harded look at New<br>Zealand and is even occasionally<br>funny um in invariably the book reflects<br>its period and is pretty patronizing<br>about wives and women in general<br>unfortunately um but true some things<br>remain true to Modern New Zealand and<br>retain their humor the obsession with<br>the All Blacks and the fact that<br>aucklanders are all up and live in a<br>noxious City so you may you may cringe<br>at some places and that place as well uh<br>given your background but<br>uh it may sit on your shelf uh and be<br>taken out for amusement now and again uh<br>with that I'd like to ask you to come up<br>and receive your medal and the small<br>token uh now to the lecture and I will<br>say a few words of introduction about<br>Professor Lisa stamp uh Professor stamp<br>is uh has an appointment here at the<br>University of atago in Christ Church uh<br>both in an academic role and a clinical<br>role is a a rheumatologist she has<br>active research interests in a variety<br>of areas including um interest in the<br>role of drugs such as interlan 17 in uh<br>rheumatoid arthritis and in particular<br>the individualization of drug treatments<br>in Rheumatic conditions her research is<br>of a very high International standing um<br>at the time of the award of the Carl<br>Smith medal uh in the papers that were<br>presented she had published 59 papers in<br>Internet National peer- reviewed<br>journals attracting more than 380<br>citations my search uh just this<br>afternoon indicated that that number of<br>papers had grown from 59 to of the order<br>of 98 so she has had a very productive<br>time since the award of this<br>medal um Professor stamp uh obtained her<br>PhD in 2004 from the University of<br>Adelaide prior to that she graduated<br>from the University of atago with her<br>mbchb and prior to that uh as I think<br>think the uh cartoon and the music<br>beforehand will attest with a diploma of<br>Music in performance cello from the<br>University of<br>Oakland uh the um International and New<br>Zealand based referees uh comments that<br>were received in support of her award<br>praised her broad contributions to the<br>profession and her patience and roles be<br>and her contributions Beyond her roles<br>at the University of<br>atago uh including service on a very<br>important New Zealand pharmac committee<br>for uh rheumatological drugs and um<br>service on an international steering<br>committee for om cat a panel developing<br>um new uh agendas for the management of<br>gout before I introduce uh Professor<br>stamp I'd also like to highlight the<br>fact that one of our leading research<br>collaborations uh University of ataga<br>research theme the otago arthritis theme<br>is led by Professor stem so with that I<br>will ask her to give her public lecture<br>tonight on gout a disease forood New<br>Sten uh thanks very much Richard uh<br>feels quite hard to stand up and talk<br>after all that I kind of feel like it's<br>going to be an<br>anticlimax um I've been told how good<br>all the other lectures have been uh and<br>so I know the bar has been set High<br>um but it's really nice to see so many<br>people having uh come out tonight so uh<br>thank you<br>all uh now as Richard said I'm going to<br>talk uh tonight about gout uh and many<br>will of you will know uh this is often<br>referred to as a disease of Kings but I<br>think it is fair to say that we could<br>consider this to be a disease of New<br>Zealand and hopefully uh tonight I'm<br>going to explain to you why uh and also<br>tell you a bit about some of the<br>research that we've been doing in this<br>area now gouts been known about for a<br>very long time uh as you'll see from<br>some of the pictures that I'll show<br>tonight there's a lot of history around<br>gout in fact there's been whole books<br>written on the history of gout about the<br>people who've been affected uh but it's<br>not uh just humans that get gout and I<br>didn't realize this until uh just<br>recently uh but some scientists in<br>America uh have recently suggested that<br>this friendly fellow here the<br>Tyrannosaurus Rex uh got Gout now the<br>literal inter uh uh defin interpretation<br>of Tyrannosaurus Rex is Tyrant King of<br>the lizards or Tyrant King of the<br>dinosaurs and so here here is yet<br>another reference to Kings in gout and<br>what they discovered uh when they were<br>examining the skeleton of this dinosaur<br>uh was these um abnormalities and the<br>bones and these are bones from the<br>fingers and toes of the dinosaur and<br>what Circle here in red you can see<br>these sort of holes uh in the bones and<br>it's probably not projecting<br>particularly well on this x-ray but also<br>these holes could be seen on the X-ray<br>and these uh holes are virtually<br>identical to the holes or the damage<br>that we see uh in the bones of patients<br>with gouch and this led these<br>researchers to conclude that indeed this<br>Tyrannosaurus Rex suffered from gr gou<br>now the other thing that I read about<br>this dinosaur is that it's carnivorous<br>grumpy and loud and that led me to<br>wonder whether any of these features uh<br>will be related to gout now I'm sure<br>some of you will have heard that there's<br>a great relationship between diet and<br>gout and a particular red meat is one of<br>those things that people often talk<br>about so I think uh the fact that this<br>was a carnivorous dinosaur was probably<br>important now farbe it from me comment<br>whether a patients with uh gout or<br>dinosaurs in with gout were indeed<br>grumpy I'll leave it to those of you in<br>the audience who have gout or perhaps<br>more importantly the partners of those<br>people uh to make that<br>call uh but if you do have gout uh<br>you'll be pleased to know you're<br>actually in very fine company uh and<br>this was written uh in the mid 1800s it<br>may be some consolation to those<br>sufferers from the disease who like<br>myself and others are only modestly<br>endowed with fortune and intellectual<br>gifts to know that great Kings princes<br>generals Admirals philosophers and many<br>more of like imminence have suffered<br>from the same<br>complaint and indeed in a study of<br>British genius heavock Ellis in 1904<br>wrote there is however a pathological<br>condition which occurs so often in such<br>extreme forms and in men of such<br>preeminent intellectual ability it is<br>impossible not to regard it as having a<br>real association with such ability I<br>refer to gout so you're in good company<br>and here are just a few of the the<br>figures through history who have been<br>thought to have gout include Galileo<br>Leonardo da Vinci Benjamin Franklin<br>Henry VII Alexander the Great George IV<br>and Sir Isaac Newton and some of you may<br>remember from more recent history uh<br>this fellow here Harry Co I think it<br>wasn't the last World Cup but perhaps<br>the one before when he couldn't uh play<br>in several matches uh because he got<br>Gout in his foot so to those of you out<br>there who might be gout sufferers<br>welcome uh to your fellow uh sufferers<br>now as I said there's a lot of history<br>about uh gout and there is a a a fellow<br>who did a lot of the early research<br>called Alfred Garett and in 1848 he<br>wrote a tree ties of gout and thanks to<br>the internet you can actually download<br>this now all 700 pages of it I I haven't<br>read all 700 pages I must admit but I<br>have read uh selected highlights and in<br>his tree TI he uh uh talked about 10<br>things that he identified about gouch uh<br>that he he had shown from his<br>observations with the patients that he<br>saw and also some of his research and<br>actually today some of the observations<br>that he made are remain true and form<br>the basis of much of what we<br>know and this was the first observation<br>that he made that true gouty<br>inflammation is always accompanied by<br>deposition of Ura of sodia in the<br>inflamed part now we don't call it urate<br>of sodia these days we call the<br>monosodium at Crystals but we see the<br>same thing down the microscope and this<br>is a picture taken from his treat eyes<br>and you can see it's a bit hard to see<br>but all these white lines on the back<br>background were the Ura of sodia<br>crystals that he<br>identified uh identifiying these uric<br>acid crystals and Joint fluid Remains<br>the gold standard way of diagnosing gout<br>technologies have moved forward we can<br>now see them at high magnification and<br>we can also see them in color and so<br>these uh the uric acid crystals these<br>needle shaped things here which uh blue<br>when they're in one direction to the<br>light uh blue that way and then uh<br>yellow in the other direction and we can<br>look at even more higher power and we<br>can see here a white cell that's within<br>the joint fluid and these needle likee<br>crystals pointing through it and this<br>cell is actually gobbling up the the<br>crystals in the joint at try and get rid<br>of them and therefore settle the gout<br>down and I was think when I look at<br>these pictures it's not hard to imagine<br>why gouts so painful when you envisage<br>that you've got these needle like uh<br>things uh within your joints and in fact<br>many patients will describe having G<br>gout as like having a broken shards of<br>glass in the<br>joint the other uh one of the second<br>things that that gared uh talked about<br>in his book in his treati was that in<br>true gout uric acid is present in the<br>blood in abnormal quantities and this<br>also remains True to this day that we<br>know that having high levels of uric<br>acid in the blood is is one of the key<br>determinant of a developing gout uh and<br>this diagram here shows that uh this is<br>from a study done in the mid 1980s in<br>the US and what they did was look at the<br>risk of somebody get getting gout uh<br>depending on their uric acid levels and0<br>42 refers to this line down here this is<br>the upper limit of the normal range that<br>we would typically see so you can see if<br>You' got Rel normal uric acid levels<br>your risk of getting gout is very low if<br>you've got high uric acid levels up to<br>about 0.54 you've got about a 20% 25% CH<br>chance of getting gout within 5 years so<br>yet again his observation uh from 1848<br>uh remains<br>true now so you might say well is this<br>all this uric acid is bad so why do we<br>actually have it and there is actually a<br>very good reason uh why we have uric<br>acid cuz because most other creatures<br>can break uric acid down into something<br>that's more water soluble and therefore<br>can be peed out in the urine but humans<br>uh lost the enzyme that can break uric<br>acid down in the Meine period which is<br>about 5 to 20 million years ago uh and<br>there was a very good reason for this<br>and that's because uric acid actually<br>increases the blood pressure and so when<br>uh we went uh from walking on all fours<br>to walking upright we needed to raise<br>our blood pressure in order to get the<br>blood up to our brain so that we could<br>stay standing up and and not faint so<br>there's a very important reason why<br>we've got uric acid now I hear some of<br>you you you laughing and I oh I suspect<br>you're laughing because of this fellow<br>here and uh in fact uh unfortunately we<br>probably are Evol evolving a slightly<br>too much towards this and there are some<br>key features of this particular fellow<br>that may actually relate to him having<br>gout as well which I'll come on<br>to so there is a very good reason why<br>we've got uric acid uh but having too<br>much uh can be a<br>problem now one of the things uh that uh<br>I find when I'm talking to patients and<br>talking to members of the public is that<br>there are a lot of myths out there about<br>gout everybody a lot of people know a<br>story about gout or a joke about gout<br>because there's been so much written<br>about it and so much talked about it and<br>when I was thinking about what I might<br>uh talk about uh tonight I uh asked<br>several people about some of the myths<br>that they knew and uh amongst some that<br>I had heard and some that other people<br>had had told me more recently I've come<br>up with these nine and uh what I hope to<br>do tonight is just talk to you a bit<br>about these nine myths and hopefully<br>dispel most of them and show you where<br>our research uh has helped in uh<br>dispelling these myths and these are the<br>nine that no one gets it anymore uh that<br>it's a man's disease so if you're a<br>woman don't worry you'll be okay<br>it's not a form of arthritis yes it<br>affects your joint but it's not actually<br>arthritis you can only get it in your<br>big toe it's a bit of a joke it's not a<br>serious condition and it will go away<br>it's on its own so you don't really need<br>to worry about it we hear lots of myths<br>about the medin for gout that you should<br>take it when you've got an acute attack<br>that you should stop it when you've got<br>an acute<br>attack uh all sorts of things about<br>taking medicines that nothing can be<br>done about the gouty lumps that can<br>develop Under the Skin and perhaps the<br>most commonly uh known myth that gout is<br>the disease of Kings because it's all uh<br>caused uh by eating and drinking too<br>much rich food uh and<br>wine uh so let's have a think about uh<br>some of these uh so firstly no one gets<br>gout anymore well<br>indeed gout is Alive and Well out there<br>rest assured uh and particularly in New<br>Zealand and this is why I think we can<br>easily consider this to be a disease of<br>New Zealand and some of you you may have<br>been here uh for Professor Vicki<br>Cameron's uh inaugural professorial<br>lecture a few weeks ago and this is uh<br>some work uh that Vicki and I did<br>together based on some data that she had<br>collected uh for the uh Community Hearts<br>study where they collected over 600 uh<br>patients uh a urban uh Mari Community a<br>rural Mari community and an urban uh<br>non- Mari community and one of the<br>questions that they asked in that study<br>was have you ever been told by a doctor<br>you've got gou and so this gave us the<br>ability uh to make comment on how common<br>it is in New Zealand and there are two<br>important things uh that I take from<br>this slide firstly you'll note that the<br>rates of gout are much higher in Mari<br>than non Mari and this is well<br>recognized that Mari and Pacific<br>Islanders in New Zealand have the<br>highest rates of g worldwide uh and the<br>other thing that you'll notice is that<br>it looks like the rates of gout are<br>increasing and so the original uh<br>studies back in the late 1950s the rates<br>of gout were reported to be about 7% of<br>men and these have gradually gone up<br>with each study that has been done over<br>time now there are a variety of reasons<br>why that might be happening some of it<br>might relate to the fact that we<br>actually see more people and diagnose<br>this condition better but I think uh<br>there is in fact a true increase uh in<br>the prevalence of this condition so yes<br>there's plenty of gout out there and New<br>Zealand has some of the highest rates uh<br>in the world<br>world so gouts a man's disease and uh I<br>was out and about with a friend earlier<br>in the week and I said to her so what do<br>you know about gout and she said oh it's<br>man's disease and she said what's more<br>it's a fat rich man's<br>disease and that is kind of The<br>Stereotype that people think about and a<br>lot of that has been driven um by<br>history and we can see this sorts of<br>pictures uh this was uh done in the late<br>1700s you can see he's a rather portly<br>fellow with a With A well-dressed table<br>sitting very comfortably and there's no<br>doubt that this would have been a rich<br>man for his time there is no doubt that<br>gout is more common in men than women<br>but it does occur in women but it is<br>slightly different women tend to get<br>gout later and we think that uh the<br>estrogen hormones that that woman uh<br>produce uh protect against gout and so<br>most women won't get gout until after<br>they've been through the menopause it<br>can also present slly differently so<br>while men may get these very severe<br>acute attacks of gou women will often<br>present just with these lumps that have<br>developed in their fingers uh and this<br>is a lady's hands I saw her shortly<br>after arriving in Christ Church and<br>these white lumps that are pretty large<br>you can see see on her finger joints are<br>actually all collections of uric acid<br>crystals Under the Skin and this is what<br>we call TPI so yes while it is a<br>stereotype man's disease does occur in<br>women okay so the third myth that gout<br>is not a form of arthritis and I know<br>that this particular picture has been<br>shown I think at least twice in the<br>health lecture series if not more uh<br>arthritis the definition of arthritis is<br>inflammation in the joints and these are<br>in this nice picture here the key<br>features of inflammation being heat<br>redness swelling pain and loss of<br>function so those are the key set things<br>that we see when a joint is inflamed and<br>I think you can see pretty clearly in<br>the picture there that the ankle and big<br>toe are clearly red they're swollen they<br>look pretty hot and they look pretty<br>sore to me and you can imagine with a<br>foot like that that it' be very hard to<br>walk around so gout is indeed a form of<br>arthritis and a particularly common one<br>in New<br>Zealand okay gout only occurs in the big<br>toe well I'm not sure about the<br>cartoon not sure there's any joints down<br>there that can get gout but there are<br>numerous other joints that can get gout<br>and this uh is a hand on the top there<br>of a patient that we looked after in the<br>ward a few years ago who had severe gout<br>and just about every joint uh in his<br>body and as you can see just about every<br>joint in his hand there is affected by<br>gout we've got some pretty fancy ways of<br>looking for gout these days and oh and<br>this is a CT scan of the feet so here<br>are the toes uh this is the big toe this<br>is the ankle area back here and yes all<br>these red dots are actually uric acid<br>crystals uh and you can see that around<br>the big toe yes there are very uh large<br>collections of uric acid crystals but<br>they are also uric acid crystals<br>scattered throughout pretty much all the<br>other regions of the foot so gout<br>doesn't just happen in the big toe it<br>okay is gout a joke I don't believe<br>anybody in this audience who's actually<br>had gout would think it's a joke uh yes<br>it is a serious condition if the joint<br>if the inflammation uh remains untreated<br>in the joint it can actually damage the<br>joint I'm not sure how well you can see<br>this on the X-ray of this hand this is<br>the same uh lady's hand who I showed you<br>a few slides ago with the big lumps on<br>the end of your fingers these are the<br>knuckle joints here these ones you can<br>see they look pretty nice and smooth<br>rounding the bones up here you can see<br>that the bone is actually been eaten<br>Away by the gout and so once that sort<br>of damage is done to a joint that's<br>irreparable and can cause a lot of pain<br>and also<br>disability we also recognize uh<br>increasingly recognize over the years<br>that gout is associated with a number of<br>other medical conditions and many<br>patients who have gout will also have<br>diabetes heart disease high cholesterol<br>and high blood pressure uh there does<br>seem to be a link between all of these<br>conditions I and that is the subject of<br>much ongoing uh<br>work okay so it's a pretty serious<br>condition it can damage your joints it<br>can be associated with other medical<br>conditions uh so it's clearly something<br>that we'd like uh to be able to do<br>something about and where my interests<br>lie uh as Richard said I I've been a<br>graduated as a doctor and developed an<br>interest in Rheumatology and my interest<br>really uh lies in answering some of the<br>questions that arrive when I see<br>patients and a lot of that revolves<br>around improving the treatments that<br>we've got for patients with<br>gout you'll be pleased to know uh that<br>uh treatments have improved since the<br>time of gared in 1848 and in his treati<br>he had uh five key things that he<br>identified needed to be done now most of<br>these are remain true today and I'm not<br>going to talk about all of them but I am<br>going to talk about uh two and the<br>second thing he said is that you need to<br>render the blood pure and I interpret<br>this as meaning that you need to cleanse<br>the blood of the high levels of uric<br>acid you'll be pleased to know that uh<br>the methods that they used back in his<br>time were bloodletting and purging and<br>equally nice such things and we have<br>considerably so uh the treatment of gout<br>there's a lot of uh myths and<br>misinformation I think about uh the<br>treatment of gout<br>gout will go away on its own I think<br>it's fair to say that that is probably<br>true uh in the very early stages of this<br>disease the first or second attack May<br>resolve on its own without any treatment<br>uh it will take longer to resolve than<br>if you go after the doctor and get some<br>medicine for it but it will go away Over<br>time however those attacks will become<br>more frequent they will become more<br>severe and eventually it just won't go<br>away what has become clear is that like<br>many other conditions we kind of have a<br>Target that we need to get to to stretch<br>uh gout successfully so for those of you<br>who might have diabetes you know your<br>doctor will want your blood sugars to<br>get to a certain level if you've got<br>high blood pressure your doctor will<br>want your blood pressure to get to a<br>certain level and we're the same when we<br>treat gout we want your blood uric acid<br>levels to get to a certain level because<br>we know if we can get the down to this<br>critical level of 36 that the gout<br>attacks will stop that those monosodium<br>urate crystals that we can see in the<br>joint will dissolve and go away<br>completely and also uh that those<br>collections of crystals underneath the<br>skin or tofi will dissolve now this<br>isn't a quick fix this does take time<br>but it will<br>happen so let's think about the ways in<br>which we might be able to cleanse the<br>body of uric acid and this is a picture<br>I took from a paper that came out a few<br>years ago and I like uh this analogy so<br>if we think about uh the body as a bath<br>uh we can fill up the bath with uric<br>acid and there's two ways we we can fill<br>up our bath we can turn on the cold tap<br>and we can eat and drink food that will<br>be broken down into uric acid we can<br>turn on the hot tap and the hot tap is<br>the body's natural way of of of breaking<br>down cells so uh all the time cells are<br>dying and new cells are being created<br>within our body and the cells that die<br>ultimately part of them will be broken<br>down to uric acid now we also have a way<br>of getting rid of uric acid and that's<br>the plug hole and for us the plug hold<br>is the kidneys and we excrete uric acid<br>out through our kidneys and into the<br>urine so if we think about it that way<br>then we can clearly highlight these ways<br>of being ways in which we could reduce<br>uh uric acid we can turn off the cold<br>tap and alter what we eat and drink uh<br>we can turn off or down the hot tap and<br>stop the uric acid being produced by the<br>body or we can pull the plug out of the<br>plug hole a bit more and get get more<br>peed out through our<br>kidneys and I a lot of ours have<br>revolved around uh turning off the hot<br>tap which is the the ability of the body<br>to actually make uric acid and there's a<br>drug that's been around for many years<br>called alopurinol uh which has been the<br>focus of of a lot of our<br>work so um there are alol has been uh<br>was released onto the market in 1964 4<br>and you would have thought that for a<br>drug uh that's been around now for<br>nearly 50 years that actually doctors<br>would know how to use this drug properly<br>uh but unfortunately I don't believe uh<br>we do uh I think that there are still U<br>myths out there about alpal amongst uh<br>many of the medical profession and some<br>of these myths uh uh have been born out<br>observational studies that were done<br>when the strug was very first released<br>one of the key things that was observed<br>was that higher doses are associated<br>with increased risk of side effects from<br>this drug particularly in patients whose<br>kidneys don't work very<br>well now there were some problems uh<br>with these observations uh which I won't<br>go into but this has really this<br>observation has really driven the way<br>gout has been managed and how this drug<br>has been used uh until very recent times<br>and the side effect that we worry about<br>particularly with this drug is a very<br>severe allergic reaction uh which can<br>cause a major blistering rash and can be<br>very very<br>nasty and clearly we want to avoid<br>this so you might say well does it<br>really matter I mean just you know just<br>give a little bit and and you know if if<br>you a little bit is okay but more might<br>not be better so just keep using the<br>lower doses but we know that if you use<br>the lower doses that it's not very<br>effective uh and this is uh from some uh<br>work that I did with some collaborators<br>in Oakland uh back in in about 2005<br>and we what we looked at here was the uh<br>number of patients who actually got<br>their blood uric acid levels low enough<br>to control their Gap relative to the<br>dose of alopurinol that they were<br>receiving and what we can see is if<br>you're on the dose that suggested by how<br>well your kidneys work just under 20% of<br>patients will actually get their uric<br>acid dose uh uric acid level low enough<br>to manage their gout so four out of five<br>patients will have still have a high<br>uric acid will still continue to get<br>gout and will actually not have any<br>benefit from taking uh the<br>drug so um after I uh uh did some of my<br>training here in Christ Church I uh my<br>first uh run as a medical registr here<br>was actually with Dr odonnell Who's in<br>the audience tonight as a general uh<br>physician and uh he uh I think think uh<br>contributed quite a lot lot to me<br>developing an interest in rheumatology<br>and I did a year of training here and<br>then I went up to Oakland uh and worked<br>at middlemore hospital uh with this chap<br>here Peter gal and Peter uh has been a<br>rheumatologist in middlemore for many<br>many years and uh the community uh that<br>middlemore hospital serves has a very<br>high modern Pacific island uh uh uh<br>number of patients and so he is perhaps<br>one of the most experienced<br>rheumatologists in New Zealand uh in<br>treating gout and when I was working<br>there as a second year regist he and<br>encouraged me to undertake uh this<br>little study which looked at uh how well<br>we were using this drug at that time and<br>how effective it was and this I think<br>was probably the first paper I ever<br>published back in 1999 in the uh in the<br>college uh journal and I've highlighted<br>and read here what the conclusion from<br>that study was which was that further<br>study is needed to clarify whether in<br>those who have not had satisfactory year<br>rate reduction one can safely increase<br>the dose of alopurinol above the<br>recommended dosing guidelines<br>and this was really uh the start of my<br>interest uh in this area now nothing<br>happens quickly in medson and uh uh it<br>wasn't until 2004 when I came back to<br>Christ Church that I really got the<br>opportunity uh to come back uh to this<br>area and uh we were lucky enough uh to<br>get funding a couple of years later to<br>undertake a study to to look at this<br>exact<br>question and uh this study uh was<br>subsequently published and I just show<br>you you two pictures here which<br>illustrate the point about using this<br>drug and the F the first is uh this here<br>which is a diagram represents an<br>individual patient from that study you<br>can see the blood uric acid levels here<br>on the vertical axis this dotted line is<br>where we actually want to get the uric<br>acid levels below this is the dose of<br>alopurinol and you can see that this was<br>actually a pretty uh uh pleasing result<br>that every time we increased the dose so<br>the uric acid level came down uh and<br>this patient did extremely well and when<br>we looked at the group of as a whole of<br>all 50 patients that were enrolled in<br>that study and the group as a whole as<br>we pushed the dose up as so the uric<br>acid levels came down so for the first<br>time in a systematic way we were able to<br>show that you can push the doses of this<br>drug higher and that uh we could achieve<br>the results that we were looking for in<br>terms of its effect on uric acid and we<br>didn't have any uh serious side effects<br>with this<br>and this is uh now been uh funded again<br>to be a much bigger study uh<br>predominantly uh to look at more at the<br>safety of this<br>approach uh so one of the things I think<br>that this highlights is that uh you do<br>need to keep uh taking your medicines uh<br>in order to get uh this effect and I'll<br>illustrate uh this uh with this little<br>diagram uh just to say that uh uh uh<br>treating gout is a long-term<br>thing and you can't stop and start the<br>medicines if you really uh want it to<br>work and so the myth that you should<br>only take them when you've got an attack<br>or stop them when you've got an attack<br>really doesn't hold true and this is the<br>reason why we can see with this<br>particular patient uh who who is also uh<br>in one of our studies that we followed<br>quite closely uh that uh this is the<br>uric acid level here in the Green Line<br>This is the Target and this is actually<br>the drug concentration that we can<br>measure in the blood you can see that as<br>the drug con concentration went up so<br>the uric acid levels came down very<br>nicely to where we wanted them and I'll<br>give you two guesses is what happened at<br>this particular Point uh and that was he<br>decided since he'd had no gout for quite<br>a while that he was cured and so he<br>proly decided to stop all his medicines<br>and that was promptly uh accompanied by<br>uh the uric acid levels shooting way<br>back up uh very high and while he got<br>away with this for several months he did<br>actually come back at 12 12 months<br>saying my gouts back what am I going to<br>do and the answer to that was fairly<br>straightforward you need to go back onto<br>your<br>medicines so uh you do need to take uh<br>the medicines uh regularly for them to<br>work okay so the other thing that we'd<br>really like to be able to do is to<br>predict whether the treatment we give<br>you is actually going to work well or<br>not uh and one of the key ways in which<br>we can uh think about doing this is by<br>looking at genetic markers and some of<br>you may have been uh here uh for Martin<br>Kennedy's uh lecture and this is the<br>basis of much of his work I think we<br>have slightly differing opinions about<br>How likely uh these things are to come<br>to<br>fruition uh I think I might be on the<br>losing end of a bit here because I<br>suspect it slightly closer than I<br>thought even a year or two ago and this<br>is why if we go back uh to our picture<br>of the bathtub uh we've talked about uh<br>turning off the hot tap and with the<br>drugs we can now think about opening up<br>the plug hole a little bit more and<br>letting more uric acid out through the<br>kidneys and there are a number of key uh<br>Transporters in the kidney that regulate<br>this very tightly and each of those is<br>encoded by a specific<br>Gene and so uh we have been involved in<br>a large uh Nationwide study that's being<br>headed by Tony maryman uh in denan and<br>uh it's called the genetics of gartan at<br>study uh it's samples are being<br>recruited uh from uh throughout the<br>country I think to date we've got just<br>about 800 patients with gout and 800<br>patients are without gout and one of the<br>first results that came out of this<br>study was that genes that control the<br>excretion of uric acid by the kidney are<br>associated with high blood uric acid<br>levels uh and with gout and there's<br>another important uh thing that the<br>study revealed which is depicted in this<br>little table is that may also part<br>explain why Mario and Pacific uh have<br>higher levels of gou because they have<br>much greater expression of these genes<br>and much greater expression of the<br>enzymes that they encode and so they uh<br>have the ability to resorb a much<br>greater amounts of uric acid from the<br>urine back into the blood and thereby<br>pushing the uric acid levels up so here<br>we can see example of why there might be<br>a genetic explanation uh for gout and<br>also give us Clues as to why our<br>indigenous population may be more uh<br>affected by this<br>disease now you might say well that's<br>all very well but what use is that well<br>the use is this is that there is a<br>particular drug called Ben brone which<br>acts on this key uh enzyme that's<br>encoded by this Gene that we have shown<br>as uh uh particularly high in some<br>groups and if you take this drug it uh<br>stops that enzyme working so well and it<br>means that you can pee out more U acid<br>so it may be that this is going to be<br>one of those tests that we might do in<br>several years time when you come to the<br>clinic we'll take a blood test look and<br>see if you've got overexpression of this<br>Gene and if you do we might say well<br>this might drug might actually be a<br>better option for you uh than the other<br>drugs that we have I think that is still<br>uh some way down the track but we're<br>that okay so what about the diet<br>my I had two bits of advice from<br>Professor Tony Kettle uh about tonight<br>one was to wear something dark because<br>it looked better on video for the<br>podcast so I've taken that bit of advice<br>uh the second bit was to tell people<br>what they could eat and drink because<br>that's all people really wanted know<br>when they've got Gout uh so I followed<br>both bits of his advice and uh gared uh<br>also uh noted uh this in his treati in<br>1848 that you needed to carefully<br>regulate uh the DI<br>diet now I think uh uh uh there's been a<br>lot of research about the diet and gout<br>recently and things really have changed<br>uh but I think we're all uh familiar<br>with this association between gout and<br>alcohol and gared wrote there's no truth<br>in medicine better established than the<br>fact that the use of fermented Liquors<br>is the most powerful of all the<br>predispose predisposing causes of gout<br>nay so powerful that it may be a<br>question whether gout would ever have<br>been known to Mad kind had such<br>beverages not been indulged in so it's<br>been recognized as a risk factor for a<br>very long<br>time so I thought what we might do now<br>is have a quick straw pole I've got<br>three different types of alcohol here<br>this is nice cool<br>gy representing the<br>spirits nice beer I know there's a few<br>beer drinkers out there and a nice glass<br>of red wine and the question question I<br>want you to answer is which of these do<br>you think is most associated with<br>causing gout so does red wine more<br>likely to cause gout is beer more likely<br>to cause gout or is Jin more likely to<br>cause<br>gout so we're going to do a quick straw<br>poll who votes for the beer hands<br>up okay who votes for the<br>Jin oh just a few okay and who votes for<br>the red wine<br>I think the red wine wins doesn't it is<br>that because you're all red wine<br>drinkers I tell you what if you're red<br>wine drinkers you're really lucky<br>because evidence is that this is least<br>likely to raise your uric acid levels<br>and cause gouch and these two are most<br>likely to raise uric acid levels and<br>cause<br>gout so you can have one but not a whole<br>bottle and this is why we can quantify<br>the risk and this was a study done in<br>the us and the numbers are a bit small<br>but I'll just tell you the guts of it<br>they basically looked at how much<br>alcohol could you drink every day well<br>before you started to increase your risk<br>and your risk went up here to about 1.5<br>times if you had between 15 and 30 gram<br>of alcohol per day and went up to nearly<br>two times if you had uh 30 grams of<br>alcohol per day this was my rough<br>calculation 15 G of wine is about a<br>glass and 15 G of beer is a probably a<br>small B<br>so if you drink that much every day<br>you'll put your risk up by about 1.5<br>times okay so I think these are probably<br>some of the key messages around gout<br>don't drink to to excess particularly if<br>your father had gout because we know<br>gout runs in family so you're giving<br>yourself a double hit if you must drink<br>to excess don't stop eating okay we know<br>that's a bad outcome if you drink too<br>much without eating enough and if you do<br>have to eat which you're going to have<br>to do if you're going to drink then you<br>bet better think prettyy carefully about<br>what you're going to<br>eat and uh this is a sort of a a gouty<br>food pyramid if you like uh and I'm not<br>going to talk about all of these Foods<br>uh but I am just going to mention a<br>couple uh so uh what about tea and<br>coffee and again this fascinated me when<br>I read this in ged's tree ties because<br>he said back in 1848 it's been suggested<br>that coffee May possess the power of<br>preventing gout seeing that in countries<br>where it's extensively drunk as in<br>Turkey gout is scarcely known but you<br>better remember that in those countries<br>they also drink a bit of wine as well<br>but an actual fact he was he was right<br>and Recent research has suggested that<br>coffee consumption actually reduces uh<br>your risk of<br>gout now the other thing you might have<br>heard about in the media is about uh<br>antioxidants and vitamin C and I know<br>there's been some discussion about these<br>over several of these Health lecture<br>series and it strikes me uh I hope<br>margarit V is not here who's our major<br>oh there she is our major vitamin C<br>researcher when I say that gouts been<br>reported to do everything from cure the<br>common cold to cancer and recently it's<br>also been Su suggested to be the new<br>best thing uh for gout and certainly in<br>patients who don't have gout the studies<br>would show that the more vitamin C that<br>you have in your diet the lower your<br>uric acid and the lower your risk of<br>gout and on the basis of that it's been<br>suggested that you should actually take<br>Vitamin C as a treatment for gout and so<br>one of the recent studies uh we've done<br>has looked at this and we uh uh enrolled<br>uh a number of patients and gave them<br>either alopurinol which you'll remember<br>is the most commonly used drug to treat<br>gout or we gave them our 500 milligrams<br>of Vitamin C a day and what we saw was<br>this this is this here represents the<br>amount that the uric acid reduced you<br>can see that if you start at alopurinol<br>which we know is blocks uric acid<br>production you dropped a uric acid by<br>quite a substantial amount if you<br>started vitamin C it did virtually<br>nothing and I think that uh there's a<br>number of explanations for this<br>certainly uh the way vitamin C is<br>purported to work is that it it it<br>increases the excretion of uric acid<br>through the kidneys so it takes the plug<br>out of the plug hole a little bit uh but<br>uh we also know that in patients with<br>gout it's actually mainly a problem in<br>the kidneys that causes the uric acid<br>levels to build up and so this is<br>probably just not strong enough uh to<br>over overpower the underlying uh<br>problem uh the other thing that has<br>received uh quite a lot of attention uh<br>in the media is also about sugar<br>consumption in gou uh and we know that<br>uh uh from uh the the gene uh genetic<br>study that there is a major interaction<br>here between genes and sugars uh and<br>this is uh Caitlyn who is currently uh<br>doing a b Medi with us on fructose<br>absorption with fructose being a type of<br>sugar but before she came to us she did<br>a a summer research project uh down in<br>the lab with Tony marman and she looked<br>at the interaction uh between sugar and<br>jees and uh this is as the base data<br>that we were working off that uh if you<br>drink a lot of sugar sweet and soft<br>drinks so your serum uric acid uh levels<br>go up and this is the number of drinks<br>uh per day so if you drink more than<br>four sugary drinks per day your risk<br>goes up quite uh significantly and what<br>Caitlyn showed uh with the data that we<br>have collected throughout New Zealand is<br>that if you drink a lot of sugary uh uh<br>soft drinks or sugary drinks and you<br>have uh that particular Gene that we uh<br>talked about before then you uh increase<br>your risk about four times of getting<br>gout so we can say that this is not<br>purely a dietary problem uh it is not<br>purely a genetic problem but there is a<br>a a major interaction and all of these<br>things U build up uh to give uh people<br>gouge now I put I put this slide here<br>because um it reminds me it reminded me<br>of something a patient said to me well<br>how can I remember what I should eat and<br>drink and this patient said to me the<br>the rule that he lived by was he should<br>never eat anything red if it was red it<br>was out uh and I think that there are<br>there there is an element of Truth in<br>that uh but not all together red meat we<br>certainly know crayfish Tomatoes This is<br>an interesting one uh in the study in<br>the data from New Zealand we asked the<br>question uh what foods uh trigger your<br>gout 20% of patients have told us that<br>Tomatoes uh trigger their gout there's<br>this is American you can tell because<br>there are some foods I wouldn't consider<br>really to be red like chocolate brownies<br>uh I think there is a certain element of<br>truth that maybe some of the red foods<br>are not good uh but I don't think it<br>applies uh to all of<br>them so uh just drawing to a close I<br>hope I've shown you uh that there are a<br>lot of myths about gout uh but a lot of<br>these uh can now uh be dispelled and uh<br>hopefully uh we could start to to treat<br>uh this condition a little bit better<br>and certainly our work is continuing in<br>this<br>area now there's still a lot uh that we<br>don't know about gout and uh you know<br>I'd still like to know more about this<br>condition and for those of you who might<br>have been in my clinic room you'll know<br>that my screen saver is is full of<br>penguins and I have a bit of a<br>fascination with penguins I'd love to go<br>to the ice I put this photo up here<br>because uh this is one of my very close<br>friends who unfortunately works for<br>Antarctic New Zealand which means she<br>gets to go to the ice every year uh and<br>uh she's told me a no un certain<br>circumstance is that despite all my<br>qualifications I have no qualifications<br>to get a job on Scot base not even as a<br>clean<br>so I've been desperately trying to find<br>another way to get to Scott base and<br>recently I I found it a year or two ago<br>when I found this paper about uh the<br>empop Penguins and what happens to their<br>uric acid when they're sitting on the<br>eggs and you can see here this is uh the<br>uric acid and this is the time here's<br>uric acid nice and low at about 75 days<br>it suddenly shoots up this is the same<br>units that we use so we think people are<br>High when they're about 6 the Penguins<br>here get up to 2. for but they can still<br>get up off the egg and waddle away so I<br>think there are probably some<br>explanations but I'm hope hopeful that<br>this might be my excuse for getting to<br>the<br>ice so obviously none of our work uh<br>would have been uh possible without our<br>funders we've had funders from funding<br>from arthritis New Zealand Kary Medical<br>Foundation the university and the health<br>uh research Council and just in closing<br>obviously any research is a team effort<br>uh the Canterbury Rheumatology<br>Immunology research group I think has<br>gone uh from strength to strength I need<br>to pay a particular thanks to my<br>clinical colleagues John and Peter who<br>support me to the hilt uh and also to um<br>my research staff who work extremely<br>hard seeing all the patients and then I<br>get to stand up here and tell you all<br>about uh what hard work they've done uh<br>and the results I'd also just uh finally<br>like uh to pay special thanks to this<br>chap here who some of you may recognize<br>I don't know whether you recognize this<br>chip this is professor John heighton who<br>is a a one of our leading<br>rheumatologists in the Eden who has also<br>been a great mentor and supporter and<br>finally I can see a number of our<br>patients out there in the audience and<br>i' just like to say particular thanks to<br>the patients who give their time and a<br>lot of their blood so we can undertake</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
