style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>atago good evening ladies and gentlemen<br>for people who don't know my name is<br>Peter Joyce and I'm Dean University of<br>Oto Christ Church and it's my pleasure<br>to chair this series of public lectures<br>we're doing a series of seven this year<br>uh each Wednesday<br>evening this year all seven of the<br>public lectures are also inaugural<br>professorial lectures and the<br>universities have Traditions that when<br>people are appointed as professors or<br>promoted that they should do a lecture<br>outlining some of the reason why the<br>university thinks they're outstanding<br>people so tonight uh the talk is for on<br>Professor Gary<br>Hooper now Gary Hooper and I were in<br>fact in the same class at medical school<br>at the University of ooto many years<br>years ago and I'm sure it was Gary's<br>presence as number eight in our scrum as<br>to why our class won the interclass<br>rugby competition a number of years in a<br>row after completing his medicine he<br>trained as an orthopedic surgeon and<br>he's in fact been when I at the calendar<br>on our staff since<br>1987 now that really means for many<br>years he was employed by the dhb and we<br>paid him virtually nothing or nothing<br>and he still taught some of the students<br>uh that are involved with us in Christ<br>Church but when alist Rothwell uh<br>retired about 6 to seven years ago uh<br>Gary was appointed as an associate<br>professor and head of the Department of<br>Orthopedics to take over from<br>alist now over his first five years as a<br>full-time joint clinical member of our<br>staff Gary's done an outstanding job um<br>and Orthopedics became uh one of the<br>most popular teaching runs in the fifth<br>year of the medical course and he's also<br>uh added new life to the research going<br>on in the department of Orthopedics so<br>the university justly promoted him to<br>2012 um before I invite Gary to come up<br>I would just like to make a comment as a<br>consumer of Orthopedic Services over the<br>last uh 6 months so the last six months<br>I have had by one of the orthopedic<br>surgeons trained by<br>Gary two knee<br>Replacements and over the summer<br>holidays I did a 3-day carrying a<br>pack and haven't needed<br>anti-inflammatories or pain relief since<br>about 10 days postoperative so I I think<br>the services provided are sometimes very<br>good uh but when I talk to others who<br>have new Replacements not all stories<br>are the same but I'm a very happy<br>customer so with that Gary to talk about<br>Peter i' taking a little bit of artistic<br>license um and call the talk uh them<br>bone them bone them Ain<br>bones what I hope to do is outline some<br>of the or showcase some of the things<br>that have happened in the orthopedic<br>Department over the last 5 years and<br>hopefully instruct you in some of the<br>direction where we're to going within<br>the orthopedic<br>department just as way of introduction<br>my name is Gary Hooper I'm a Christ<br>Church born lad Who's Back In Christ<br>Church I've never left<br>really my progress into academic<br>Orthopedics uh was a slow one as Peter<br>alluded to but I'm very grateful to my<br>wife Lee and my family for supporting me<br>in my career change not only am I<br>grateful to my family I'm extremely<br>grateful to my colleagues<br>without my colleagues in the orthopedic<br>Department this shift in direction would<br>possible so really what we're going to<br>talk about is<br>future what is<br>arthritis well arthritis is when the<br>bone becomes<br>rotten here's a good bone with a nice G<br>between the bone surfaces on the medial<br>lateral side of the knee joint this is<br>Peter's knee before he had his knee<br>replacement when the rust was rubbing on<br>the rust the bone was collapsed and that<br>caused<br>osteoarthritis but between the two bone<br>ends is articular cartilage articular<br>cartilage is the absorbed surface which<br>protects our bone<br>ends when we look at articular cartilage<br>through the<br>arthroscope it's nice and smooth we put<br>a probe in it and it's nice and spongy<br>this is the absorptive surface that<br>protects your knee and looks like that<br>in the normal<br>patient<br>unfortunately we're all prone to<br>accidents and if we twist our knee or<br>put an abnormal strain or Shear Force<br>across it often we can damage the<br>articular cartilage articular cartilage<br>damage like that predisposes to<br>osteoarthritis just a little bit of<br>background on articular cut<br>this is a histology section of articular<br>cartilage which is labeled for you<br>here's the bone here here's the<br>articular surface here the most<br>important feature to notice about<br>articular cartilage is there are a few<br>cells through it but most of it is a<br>morphous background substance so there's<br>not a lot of activity going in the<br>background 70% of this articular<br>water now we all all know from our fifth<br>form schooling that if we compress water<br>it's impossible we get a plastic<br>container and push on the water at the<br>top it's going to burst the container<br>before it compresses the water so it's<br>this noncompressibility um function of<br>uh water which allows the articular<br>cartilage to absorb Force so if a force<br>comes down through the articular<br>cartilage the water dissipates to<br>another area of the articular cartilage<br>when the force goes away the water<br>returns and it's that motion and that<br>activity which allows the articular<br>cartilage to absorb<br>Force articular cartilage is made up of<br>a lot of cells and these large<br>proteoglycans have mucopolysaccharides<br>attached to them called Condren sulfate<br>and kin sulfate there are two that we<br>can see within articular carage the<br>function of those<br>mucopolysaccharides is that they like<br>water a lot so they're very water filic<br>or hydrophilic and they attract water<br>and attach water to these<br>molecules and they're the molecules<br>which allow the water to be retained in<br>articular cartilage and within the<br>articular cartilage we can see these<br>proteoglycans and water surrounded in a<br>scaffold or a framework of collagen<br>which holds those proteoglycans and<br>water molecules within the within the<br>articular cartridge and allows the<br>structure to<br>exist once those cartil once that<br>collagen molecules become damaged or the<br>structure of the scaffold dissipates or<br>is damaged those water molecules can<br>escape and that's just a simple view of<br>how articular cartilage develops within<br>the<br>knee I'm sorry how arthritis develops<br>within the<br>knee ostearthritis in the 50s and 60s<br>was a major problem for people because<br>there was no real cure for it not until<br>this gentleman came along Sir John<br>Charley so John Charley invented the hip<br>replacement<br>and almost overnight he was able to cure<br>people of their osteoarthritic pain and<br>so John Charley started with hip<br>replacement in the 60s we now progressed<br>through into the next Millennia uh with<br>ongoing develops in the hip replacement<br>surgery we'll talk a little bit about<br>that as we go on this<br>evening hip replacement at the moment<br>within the United States both hip and<br>knee replacement combined is the most<br>common surgical procedure<br>performed and it is the most<br>costeffective of surgical procedure that<br>we can give to<br>patients we have an aging population we<br>have an epidemic of joint replacement<br>occurring within the within developed<br>countries we have an aging population<br>that increases the risk of OST<br>ostearthritis and increase the need for<br>joint replacement we have an increasing<br>healthy retired population so we have<br>patients who are 60 and 70 years of age<br>the I mean 70 and 80 years of age these<br>these days who want to do what 50 and 60<br>year olds wanted to do 20 and 30 years<br>ago so they have an increased<br>requirement an increased demand and they<br>have increased<br>expectations if we look at the figures<br>in the United States these are<br>projections out to 2030 that's only 16<br>years away so these are projections out<br>to 2030 Hipp arthroplast is going to<br>increase by<br>157% that's the demand for hip<br>arthroplasty in 16 years newe<br>673 along with that comes the necessity<br>to have a revision procedure not all hip<br>not all hip and knee Replacements last<br>last forever in fact we know all of them<br>are going to wear out sooner or later<br>the longer you have them then the more<br>likelihood they're going to wear out so<br>revision procedure that is a procedure<br>to replace the index procedure replace<br>the worn out hip replacement is going to<br>increase and they're going to increase<br>about the same percentage<br>so you can see that this is going to<br>place an extreme burden on the costs of<br>Health Services particularly when you<br>bear in mind that each revision<br>procedure is about four times more<br>expensive than the primary<br>procedure what about a New Zealand do we<br>have the same figures in New Zealand we<br>are lucky enough to have uh New Zealand<br>joint registry which which looks at all<br>the joint indexes all the joint<br>Replacements performed in New Zealand on<br>a database Alister Rothwell who Peter<br>mentioned earlier was instigator and uh<br>organizing this registry and he's still<br>um Champion it today we looked at the<br>New Zealand joint registry and we looked<br>at the New Zealand census and with the<br>help of Alex who's over there one of the<br>junior registrars we looked at some of<br>the results of uh joint replacement<br>surgery in New Zealand and the demand<br>for joint replacement surgery if we look<br>at this column here this is the numbers<br>of joint Replacements per 100,000 of<br>population and the bottom X AIS here the<br>Y AIS is a year looking at hip<br>replacement it's increasing looking at<br>total knee replacement it's also<br>increasing if we look at the age band<br>where it's increasing we can see that<br>the 70 to 79 year old age group are the<br>group that demand hip and knee<br>Replacements the most within our country<br>we can also see that females require it<br>more commonly Than<br>Miles interestingly if we look at the<br>ethnic data here this line here is the<br>Pacific Islanders the increase in<br>requirement for hip replacement or knee<br>replacement in Pacific Islands that's<br>increasingly uh is increasing quite<br>significantly difficult to know why<br>that's happening we presume it's because<br>the Pacific island has come to New<br>Zealand to have their hip and knees<br>replaced rather than having it done in<br>the Pacific Islands but if we look at<br>other areas like the Caucasian line it's<br>increasing slightly the Mari<br>interestingly has decreased slightly not<br>a lot but decreased slightly perhaps<br>that's an indication of their access for<br>care or their their limitation of access<br>for care but this is the graph that you<br>need to keep in mind this is the<br>projections for hip and knee replacement<br>in New Zealand by<br>2030 so by 2030 knee Replacements which<br>is the red line is going to cross as the<br>most acute demand or the most highest<br>demand compared to hip replacements by<br>about 2020 and by 2030 the demand is<br>going to<br>Triple the demand for hip replacement is<br>double so we can see that by 2030 we<br>have a huge demand of hip and Ne<br>Replacements that's going to swamp New<br>Zealand we have to be prepared for that<br>we have to be able to train surgeons and<br>train doctors to be able to deal with<br>that the estimation is to deal with this<br>we need an extra 100 orthopedic surgeons<br>alone to deal with this problem now<br>having said that this is a fairly<br>isolated problem this is Hipp arthritis<br>it's not a but it is a little bit of a<br>window into muscular scal problems so it<br>tells us what's going to happen with our<br>population with all of our muscular scal<br>problems as time goes on so the demand<br>is just going to<br>escalate the World Health Authority<br>outlines the top disease in the world of<br>the disease that requires the most input<br>is psychiatric diseases the second most<br>common disease that requires input is<br>muscular scal diseases so this is a huge<br>problem for our population for our um<br>our government and our our funding<br>agencies knee replacement is going to<br>overtake hip replacement why is that<br>well there's better survival for doal<br>KNE Replacements so there's probably a<br>lower threshold to proceed to the<br>surgery there is a prevalence of obesity<br>in our society and our obese are<br>increasing to get larger there certainly<br>is a direct correlation between<br>osteoarthritis of the knee uh and<br>obesity which is not so prevalent an<br>ostearthritis of the<br>hip we also have our females living<br>longer therefore increasing the demand<br>for hip<br>replacement for knee replacement sorry<br>if as I mentioned earlier all joint<br>Replacements are going to fail sooner or<br>later so if we look at the New Zealand<br>joint registry and look at the reasons<br>for revision of hip replacements alone<br>loose cup loose stem dislocation<br>unstable they are the top three and just<br>look at the figures there and there<br>forget about everything else but they<br>are the top three so loosening and<br>dislocation are the things that cause<br>the revision procedures as time goes<br>on so why do we get loosening of our<br>femoral component and our acetabular<br>component the primary cause of loosening<br>is polyethene wear disease or wear<br>debris within the joint and subsequent<br>reaction of the body to that that wear<br>degree so for example if we have<br>polyethylene which wears and all<br>polyethylene is going to wear with<br>time then it creates little pieces of<br>polyeth the tissues macres come along<br>clean up those areas of polyethylene<br>within the tissues they become big and<br>fat and full of polyethylene then they<br>burst they release these gyal enzymes<br>They Don't Really burst but they do<br>release these gomal enzymes and these<br>gomal enzymes eat away at the bone so<br>that if you got a well functioning hip<br>replacement you can s suddenly see<br>there's a big hole in the bone some 20<br>years after the hip replacement because<br>of polyethlene wear disease so that is a<br>major issue with polyethylene and wear<br>of these joint Replacements as time goes<br>on so why does the polyethylene<br>wear polyethylene wears because it<br>becomes oxidated and once you oxidize<br>polyethylene the ability the polyethene<br>to resist wear decreases<br>dramatically this here is a cartoon of a<br>polyethylene molecule polyethylene<br>consists of these ultral line long<br>molecules of polyethylene with very<br>little cross linking or or linking<br>between the polyeth molecules and<br>because of that we have these free<br>so-called free radicals areas where<br>oxygen can bind to and once oxygen binds<br>to that it becomes oxidized it loses its<br>strength and it wears more rapidly<br>so we've developed ways to try and<br>reduce that that uh um those free<br>radicals and decrease the oxygenation of<br>the PO of the polyethylene one way is by<br>increasing the number of bonds between<br>it so cutting out these uh free radicals<br>and increasing the number of bonds a<br>mechanism of doing that is by<br>irradiating the polyethylene so if we<br>irradiate the polyethylene we can cause<br>cross linkages across the polyethylene<br>and increase its ability uh to sustain<br>wear and this is is what it looks like<br>once you've had these poly these cross<br>linkages applied to the polyeth<br>molecule<br>so we can reduce the amount of wear by<br>decre by uh by changing the polyethylene<br>and what about dislocation if we can<br>reduce the wear of if we can reduce the<br>wear of polyethene maybe we can make the<br>polyethene a little bit thinner maybe we<br>get on a bigger head within a hip<br>replacement and decrease the risk of<br>dislocation a bigger head means a bigger<br>range of motion before the hip will<br>dislocate well a study that we did here<br>some uh started about 6 and A2 years ago<br>was a study looking at cross-link<br>polyethylene and wear in total hip<br>replacements this uses this particular<br>type of polyethylene called X3<br>polyethylene part of the problem with<br>cross-linking polyethylene is you make<br>it more brittle and so it becomes more<br>uh able to fracture within the hip<br>replacement and so more susceptible to<br>fracture so there's a line between<br>making the polyethene wear resistant and<br>mechanically unstable and likely to<br>fracture so we looked at this new<br>generation polyethylene um and uh<br>studied it out using a special computer<br>software program which was also<br>developed in New Zealand by orthopedic<br>surgeon in Wellington which looks on a<br>computer image at the amount of wear<br>Within These two concentric circles and<br>so we're able to measure how much<br>volumetric wear and how much uh um uh<br>horizontal wear there was within the<br>polyethylene this was a prospective<br>study of 100 people all under 65 so all<br>young people are likely to wear their<br>hips more uh aggressively than older<br>people undergo total hip replacement and<br>we measure them out for 1 2 and 5 years<br>and this is our wear line this maybe not<br>that dramatic to you but what it<br>actually shows you is a steady state<br>wear of the polyethylene all the wear is<br>below one one is determined as the<br>threshold for wear or anything above one<br>is bad wear so this is all good wear<br>below uh one so the issue is that these<br>this study has shown that it that X3<br>polyethylene and I have to admit this is<br>the first study in the world where we've<br>looked at 36 mm heads with X3<br>polyethylene uh showed uh decreased wear<br>and the wear rate was certainly within<br>this uh uh uh area which is the safe<br>area there was no polyethene fractures<br>there were no dislocations and that<br>encouraged us to continue the use of<br>this type of polyethylene and hip<br>replacements there are alternative<br>bearings and some of you may be aware of<br>people who have had ceramic on ceramic<br>or metal on metal implants now these<br>hard on hard bearings are excellent for<br>wear they decrease the wear rate<br>significantly particularly ceramic on<br>ceramic bearings so if we look at the<br>wear rate of ceramic on ceramic and this<br>just a diagrammatic form of the wear you<br>can see that ceramic on ceramic produces<br>the best wear rate so why wouldn't you<br>use ceramic on ceramic all the time<br>likewise look at metal on metal metal on<br>metal gives you good wear rates too why<br>wouldn't you use metal on<br>metal well ceramic on ceramic is good<br>it's the new types of ceramic called the<br>biock Forte uh and toughened and<br>hardened ceramic and probably give a<br>good results the the um literature from<br>the companies will tell you that their<br>wear rates are significantly less than<br>metal on polyethylene that we talked<br>about<br>before but there are issues with ceramic<br>on ceramic<br>implants and there are two main issues<br>which deter surgeons from using them the<br>first issue is fracture of the ceramic<br>the ceramic is an extremely brittle<br>compound and doesn't light abnormal<br>stress across it it will fracture the<br>other cause is abnormal noise or<br>squeaking so let's go through those to<br>start with ceramic fracture ceramic<br>fracture occurs because of generally<br>speaking of two problems one was with a<br>smaller head if you look at the femoral<br>neck there here's the head of the<br>implant you've got to push a femoral<br>neck up into the head of the implant so<br>if the head is only 28 mm in diameter<br>there's a smaller amount of ceramic are<br>more likely to be fractured by impaction<br>of that M taper into the head for<br>example if someone falls off a off a<br>step or jumps down firmly on the ground<br>they might impact that MSE taper into<br>the head and Fracture the femal head so<br>femoral head fracture was an issue early<br>on in ceramicon camic implants when we<br>move to bigger um femal heads for<br>example 32 mm 36 mm head the incidence<br>of fracture decreased so we seem to have<br>that solved femal head fracture didn't<br>seem to be a<br>problem so we then looked at the other<br>issue which is the cup so this is a<br>metal cup and inside the metal cup is a<br>ceramic liner so that the ceramic can<br>articulate on the ceramic ceramic liners<br>are are very dependent on the<br>positioning of the cup so if you<br>appreciate this cup it's a little bit<br>steep compared to where the normal hip<br>should sit so the Cup's a little bit<br>steep which means that the head loads<br>the top part of the cup a little bit<br>more than it should and as a result<br>after wear and tear this is what happens<br>so after usage the ceramic fractures so<br>the Ceramics extremely brittle and can<br>fracture and that's what it looks like<br>when it comes out at the time of surgery<br>so that's one of the reasons why we keep<br>away from some of us keep away from<br>ceramic on ceramic implants the other<br>problem though is a little bit more<br>perturbing this is the squeaking of<br>ceramic on ceramic implants so all metal<br>on metal implants will make a noise and<br>this is the squeaking which can often<br>occur some months after<br>surgery certainly researchers suggested<br>that the squeaking is not normal ceramic<br>on ceramic implants are very smooth they<br>move beautifully in your hand when<br>you're looking at them uh uh outside the<br>body they're very wettable which means<br>that the lubrication of them is<br>excellent and so they movees smoothly<br>and sweetly and the wear rate is very<br>low if that lubrication for some reason<br>becomes abnormal if the ceramic head<br>becomes a little bit worn or whatever<br>that stops the lubrication once that<br>happens they develop a noise and they<br>can develop noise secondary to uh loss<br>surface squeaking<br>hips patients come to me and suggest<br>they should use an oil can to to uh to<br>get rid of the squeak lubricate the<br>squeak they say well it'd be great if it<br>was easy as that that but it's not as<br>easy as that to change a hip that's<br>squeaking is a major operation to change<br>the componentry and to change them to a<br>different componentry that doesn't<br>squeak for example this is a patient of<br>mine this is the very first hip I've had<br>to revise for squeaking this is a<br>patient who had a hip implanted she was<br>fine for 2 years she came back to see me<br>and said Doctor my hip's starting to<br>squeak I said I don't worry about it the<br>literature says it's fine it'll go away<br>just give it time so she went away and<br>came back a year later and says it's<br>still squeaking and I says well all the<br>literature says it should go away and<br>we're in that time we're investigating<br>them and we had ceram Tech who the<br>Distributors of ceramic came to New<br>Zealand and talked to us about said<br>doesn't happen anywhere else in the<br>world I so okay so doesn't happen<br>anywhere else in the world with any<br>people so it must go away she came back<br>two years later said Doctor you got to<br>do something about this get rid of it<br>she says I had to go to a funeral the<br>other day I walked into the funeral and<br>stood up and turned around and see what<br>the noise was so these squeaks are<br>actually quite loud sometimes in these<br>patients and that's the the issue when<br>we took a hip out we can see that the<br>femoral head had an area of abnormal<br>wear on it and the cup also had an area<br>of abnormal wear I've outlined that a<br>little better on the rim of the cup<br>there so that's where she was squeaking<br>when those two areas moved together she<br>seemed to be squeaking from that area<br>that's our premise that's what we<br>suspect so these squeaking hips made us<br>wonder about why they're squeaking where<br>they're squeaking from what's the<br>problem<br>James burn who works in our department<br>years ago looked at Acoustic emissions<br>and acoustic monitoring of hip<br>replacements so we've taken up his his<br>impetus and Tred to look at acoustically<br>listening to these hip<br>replacements so if we thought if we<br>listen to the hip replacement we be able<br>to tell where they're squeaking from and<br>therefore maybe if we can convert that<br>to real patients listen to real patients<br>see if they're squeaking and then get in<br>there and do something quickly before<br>there became a major damage with the hip<br>so this is a study which we've run in<br>conjunction with the University of<br>Canterbury we've um had Jeff Rogers on<br>it who got a fct grant to to do this as<br>a post do and Tim Woodfield and I have<br>been working with them on this and a lot<br>of final year university education uh<br>engineer students have been working on<br>it as well so these are the rigs that<br>they've set up for us we've got a<br>robotic rig where we can listen to the<br>hippers it's put through its Paces we've<br>got sensors on it so acoustic monitors<br>which come off it that listen to The Hip<br>as it's been put through its range of<br>motion to try and ascertain where the<br>hip is squeaking from where that noise<br>is coming from we've also developed<br>acoustic monitors or acoustic uh uh um<br>transmitters which can be strapped to<br>the patient so patients who present to<br>us with a squeaking hip we get them to<br>be listened to<br>beforehand have their hip revised and<br>then listen to The Hip on uh the rig<br>with the robot to see whether we can<br>make some decision about where the<br>squeaking is coming from this is a<br>typical readout that you might see from<br>a hip replacement and we're quite<br>confident that this loud signal here is<br>the articulation that's the noise that's<br>coming from the<br>articulation having looked at some of<br>our studies as well we can see that the<br>noise that comes from the ball on the<br>end of the femoral stem so the mo taper<br>where it's attached sounds like this so<br>we can see this completely different<br>frequency where the mor taper um squeak<br>comes from as to oppos to the<br>articulation squeak we're hoping that<br>this drives us s along the line of being<br>able to clinically look at patients who<br>may be asymptomatic listen to their hip<br>and make some sort of clinical decision<br>about where the squeak's coming from and<br>whether they need treatment for<br>that what about Metal on Metal well<br>you've all read the newspaper you've all<br>listened to the news metal debris is bad<br>news metal debris caus<br>kidney goes to the kidneys goes to the<br>liver and is present in the urine<br>metalions inhibit macras and suppress<br>the inflammatory response so if you open<br>up a patient who's had a metalon metal<br>implant their hip looks a vascular you<br>open it up and the hip capture looks a<br>vas it's white that's devoid of any<br>obvious living tissue um biopsies around<br>metalen joints certainly show aity of<br>cells metalon metal implants were um<br>popular ized in the UK with surface<br>Replacements Birmingham surface<br>Replacements being popularized as not<br>really joint Replacements they just<br>something to hold you over for a few<br>years before you need your real joint<br>replacement but the trouble is these big<br>balls and metal interfaces shed chromium<br>and Cobalt irons and the chromium and<br>Cobalt irons are the problem with these<br>implants there's lots of it in the<br>literature lots of it in the Food and<br>Drug Administration and lots of it uh<br>within uh our our own uh media as<br>well what happens when you get an excess<br>of metal ions within the body or within<br>the hip not so much in the body it's<br>generally within the hip joint those<br>metals can cause a hyper sensitivity<br>reaction that hyp sensitivity reaction<br>causes proliferation of tissue that<br>looks ugly like that so you get these<br>big black T pseudo tumors we call them<br>they're not really tumors but it's a<br>hyper sensitivity reaction to the soft<br>tissue<br>just recently our summer student ship in<br>the last uh Christmas holidays we had<br>Gabriel who was working with us in<br>partnership with Margaret vus and Tim<br>Woodfield and myself she was looking at<br>the investigation uh investigating the<br>contribution of hypoxia inducible Factor<br>uh to co Cobalt induc pseudotumor<br>formation just want to steal a couple of<br>her slides I want to show you what she<br>found so this is a<br>this Factor here<br>hiff is has been implicated in the<br>production of cells within so-called<br>tumors or increasing cells within tumors<br>if you have a low oxygen content or a<br>high Cobalt level you will induce hiff 1<br>and hiff one alpha and hi 1 beta to<br>cause a change within the cells right<br>the end result of that change is it's an<br>increased proliferation and survival of<br>the cells to produce a tumor like<br>membrane within the<br>hip so we did some studies of this<br>membrane to see whether there was hiff<br>one present hiff one stains Brown and I<br>think for those of you back there<br>looking at the right hand slides you can<br>see that there's Brown everywhere so<br>what we found never been found before in<br>the world all right this is new stuff we<br>found that hi one is present in these<br>pseudo Chimas let's say we can give the<br>patient something to get rid of that if1<br>or to suppress that H1 maybe that means<br>that we can stop the presence of<br>pseudotumor stop the problems associated<br>with metalon metal<br>articulations watch the<br>space there's one other type of<br>articulation that I haven't really<br>talked about and that's ceramic on metal<br>ceramic on metal articulations are used<br>uniformly within the aviation industry<br>most of the bearing surfaces within<br>those big Jet Plane engines are ceramic<br>on metal ceramic on metal the engineers<br>love it it's the best thing since sliced<br>bread there's no we associated with it<br>it's very very good and very user<br>friendly that's all very well in a jet<br>engine what's it like in a human so we<br>wanted to look at a comparison between<br>ceramic on metal and Metal on Metal<br>total hip replacements it had been done<br>once before in South Africa but it been<br>an industry-led project and we were<br>doubtful of the results so we wanted get<br>an independent view about what was going<br>on with this type of implant so the<br>potential advantages of ceramic on metal<br>of course were that there' be decreased<br>wear rates and less metal irons because<br>there's only one metal surface we<br>thought there'd be less squeaking and we<br>thought there'd be less component<br>fractur certainly you can't get a<br>fracture of the ceramic liner cuz there<br>ain't any ceramic<br>liner so we did a randomized controlled<br>trial looking at these we've we've got<br>the 12 results here but in fact the<br>5year results are becoming available a<br>little later this year the consort<br>diagram shows that we got most of the<br>people enrolled we only lost three to<br>follow up which is a pretty good uh uh<br>outcome with this type of randomized<br>controlled trial and what did we find<br>find well we found that there was no<br>difference really between ceramic on<br>metal and Metal on Metal<br>cups we still generate Cobalt levels and<br>we still generate chromium levels allbe<br>it at low levels all right the threshold<br>for intervention or the threshold for<br>worry is<br>seven in the international literature so<br>it's well below seven and certainly for<br>those of you that got a metal on metal<br>implant or those who got a ceramic on<br>metal implant at 5 years it looks like<br>it may be plaing off but it certainly<br>doesn't look like a metal on metal is<br>any better than a ceramic on metal or<br>vice<br>versa their functional results were<br>equal so the patients were fun in<br>superbly they had no indication that<br>anything was wrong with their<br>hips so what about the<br>future we've talked a little bit about<br>hard on hard bearing surfaces certainly<br>in the United Kingdom metal on metal<br>implants have now been banned so no one<br>can put a metal on metal implant in in<br>the United Kingdom certainly in the<br>public service<br>NHS whether that's Revisited with better<br>mety as time goes on who knows but I<br>suspect there'll be a very high<br>threshold not to not to go down that<br>route we've looked at po modification of<br>polyethylene and certainly modification<br>of polyethylene gives us good wear<br>capabilities so cross lening our<br>polyethlene either by radiating it or<br>more commonly Now by using other U<br>modalities chemical modalities such as<br>vitamin A or vitamin E to impregnate the<br>polyethene to clean up those free<br>radicals may have a large part to play<br>in the future certainly our wear<br>capabilities for ceramic on Crosslink<br>polyethylene has shown good 20 to 25<br>year wear rates and so hips lasting well<br>out past 25 30 years perhaps is an<br>indication for new surfaces and there is<br>development in different types of<br>plastics and different types of surfaces<br>which may become apparent as time goes<br>on one of the problems we see with<br>revision procedure is loss of bone this<br>is not a hip replacement but this is a<br>loss of bone this is a patient who's a<br>GI got a giant cell tumor of his distal<br>FEMA with a big loss of bone in his<br>distal FEMA how can we treat that well<br>we can treat that by filling it up with<br>an implant we can put a piece of metal<br>in there and fill the hole with an<br>implant makes<br>sense but as I told you earlier all<br>these implants fail sooner or later what<br>happens when that fails down the track<br>and what happens when it wears<br>out we've been very lucky here in Christ<br>Church because we've got a company which<br>is C registered and uh produces custom<br>implants producing custom implants for<br>about 18 years right no one really knows<br>much about that I was recently<br>highlighted a an article in the herald<br>in London where an orthopedic surgeon<br>was being championed because he had<br>replaced half a pelvis with a new<br>customized implant a new customized<br>pelvis built a new pelvis it said we've<br>been doing that here for 18 years but no<br>one's really highlighted<br>it so this is a customized implant in a<br>in a in a hip replace placement that uh<br>had bone loss all of you can appreciate<br>there's some bone loss there this<br>patient over the course of time has said<br>here's where a normal hip replacement<br>sits this one's sitting inside the<br>pelvis that she's lost half of her<br>acetab half of a pelvis as this implant<br>is sitting inside the pelvis it's a huge<br>amount of bone lost in that patient so<br>what we can do here we have the<br>technology here in Christ Church<br>to download a CT and with a CT then<br>build an implant around that particular<br>model that's been available for some<br>time one of our members of Staff of the<br>of our department has developed this and<br>so it's been uh available for some<br>considerable period of time and that's<br>implanted<br>but where is the future of revision<br>surgery we need something which is<br>structurally stable we have to put<br>something in which is stable the minute<br>it goes in so a patient can wait be on<br>it has to be stable enough so someone<br>can walk on it immediately<br>postoperatively because most of our 70<br>80 year olds who having revision<br>procedures like this ain't going to be<br>non-weight bearing they have to have<br>weight across their hip it's a<br>unreasonable to expect them to be non<br>wering we need an implant which has got<br>sorry we need an implant which has got<br>some sort of osteoconductivity ability<br>so we'd like an implant to be able to re<br>create the bone while it's in there<br>perhaps we can develop some sort of<br>resorbable metal<br>constructs where we can implant stem<br>cells within the resorbable metal<br>constructs to develop new bone to allow<br>that bone to regenerate within the<br>patient that would be the optimum<br>there's certainly been some work done<br>here by Tim Woodfield and his group with<br>magnesium metals and resorbable metals<br>within this type of situation maybe in<br>the other area that we need to look at<br>is developing articulation debris which<br>is<br>inert okay so we started off with a<br>slide earlier on Back to the<br>Future this is the problem what can we<br>do for it well we do have mechanisms we<br>do have strategies to deal with this<br>type of problem now we can debde it I'll<br>just go back one slide so you can have<br>another look at it there a large flake<br>of articular cartilage which patients<br>complain about mechanical symptoms it<br>locks it catches it causes problems so<br>as an intimate measure we can certainly<br>get rid of those large flakes of<br>articular cartilage make it smoother and<br>give them a little bit of enjoyment for<br>some time but we still leave a big<br>crater there there's no potential for<br>that to heal uh significantly we can try<br>and create a healing potential by<br>drilling through to the bleeding vessels<br>underneath the bone and that might<br>recreate some articular cartilage but it<br>won't be normal articular cartilage it<br>will be fiber cartilage it won't have<br>the same properties of articular<br>cartilage and it'll wear out<br>rapidly we can take osteochondral plugs<br>from elsewhere within the knee and plug<br>them into the defect like that so-called<br>mosaa<br>pasty here's a patient that I've done a<br>mosaa plasty on a lateral femoral condo<br>you can see the plug of bone and<br>articular cartilage has been implanted<br>but it leaves a defect that's the defect<br>from behind the kneecap where the<br>articular cartilage was taken from we<br>can plug it with the piece of old bone<br>that came from there but it's never<br>going to be<br>normal and at a year or two years down<br>the track doesn't look too bad really I<br>mean it looks good the articular<br>cartilage look reasonably well preserved<br>and you can see where the graft has been<br>implanted but the trouble with these of<br>course is we can only do reasonably<br>small defects we can't do large major<br>defects we can look at regenerative<br>technology so some of the reg<br>regenerative Technologies around have<br>been autoist contrite transplantation<br>this involves two operations so you come<br>and have an operation we take some of<br>your articular cartilage send it off the<br>lab the lab grows it puts it back in a<br>little bottle for us you come back to<br>surgery have your area exposed<br>again have a little periostal flap<br>placed over that and then the uh contra<br>syringed underneath that periostal flap<br>this is what it looks like this is a<br>defect in the pelop fal joint and<br>there's the periostal flap and we inject<br>a whole lot of condra sites underneath<br>that periostal<br>flap doesn't make a lot of sense so<br>really does it you're expecting those<br>condra sites to develop into that<br>beautiful piece of articular cart we<br>showed you right at the start there's<br>got to be something more to it than that<br>you're expecting a lot of nature to<br>develop um normal articular cart when<br>you do that so there are significant<br>problems with these current repair meth<br>methods one is they're unreliable<br>secondly they can only deal with<br>relatively small defects not large<br>defects I've stolen these slides from<br>Tim Tim is our uh senior research fellow<br>who's doing all our work with our uh<br>regenerative medicine project in our in<br>our department and this is essentially<br>the idea of tissue engineering so tissue<br>engineering to try and red develop<br>normal articular cartilage so we have<br>the defect you saw this picture just<br>earlier this is this condal fracture we<br>then prepare the the cells within a<br>within a SCA uh within a scaffold we<br>populate that scaffold we make a little<br>implant like so and we insert that<br>implant into the knee like so sounds<br>good doesn't it sounds like it might<br>work sounds pretty<br>good so one of the issues with<br>bioengineering articular cartilage is<br>that articular cartilage consists of<br>several layers and it consists of bone<br>on the under surface and so to fabricate<br>this type of tissue engineering or this<br>tissue repair model we need to be able<br>to<br>fabricate um different layers of the<br>articular cartilage you're wishing to<br>replace so this is our current concept<br>is that by using uh 3D printers with<br>different um cells at different levels<br>we can<br>recreate articular cartilage in a more<br>model we have our first<br>real live great 3D printer arriving uh<br>next month correct him next month so<br>that's um being funded by the University<br>and we're looking forward to using that<br>with some of our early uh experience<br>particularly with uh with um animal<br>models so we've gone through sort of a<br>bit of a a a travel log of what can<br>happen with uh ostearthritis the<br>treatment of ostearthritis your joint<br>replacement and a little bit about what<br>the future holds in my mind regenerative<br>Technologies hold the key to the future<br>but<br>we're not naive they are some time away<br>right unfortunately they're not for you<br>but they may be for your daughter or<br>your son okay but there are we way away<br>so in the meantime we still have joint<br>replacement and as our Dean has told us<br>the joint replacement is the best<br>operation in the world correct Peter so<br>he tells you that this gets rid of your<br>pain there are a<br>few problems with joint replacement I've<br>alluded to them but most joint<br>Replacements lasts well for 20 OD years<br>so it's a good holding maneuver until we<br>can get regenerative Technologies up and<br>running however joint replacement<br>surgery is expensive surgery and you've<br>already seen my figures on the Aging<br>population and we've talked a little bit<br>in the media about the unmet need so<br>there's a huge number of people out<br>there that need these procedures and<br>that's going to put enormous pressure on<br>health funding I remind you this is<br>election<br>year and also<br>finally we as a community have got to<br>make some decisions about where we're<br>going we as a community have got to<br>decide where we're going to spend that<br>money are we going to spend that money<br>on 100 hip replacements to help 100<br>people or are we going to put in a liver<br>transplant those sort of decisions are<br>tough decisions but they're decisions<br>that are going to have to be made by the<br>community as we go on because the health<br>dollar pot doesn't get any bigger it's<br>not as R tells us it's not<br>bottomless and we have to be aware of<br>that for our future uh um developments<br>in our future resources for Orthopedics<br>thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
