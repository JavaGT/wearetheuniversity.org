font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen for<br>people who don't know my name's peter<br>joyce i'm dean university of otago<br>christchurch it's my pleasure to chair<br>this<br>lecture tonight by professor david<br>murdock which is the third in a series<br>of seven public lectures that we're<br>putting on this year at the same time<br>this year as last year<br>um they are all inaugural professorial<br>lectures<br>although for david murdoch<br>unlike many of our other speakers<br>there's been a considerable delay<br>between appointment and him delivering<br>this and although inaugural professorial<br>lectures are old traditions and<br>universities sometimes even old<br>institutions have lapses<br>in memory and lapses in process and<br>people slip through gaps<br>but eventually we catch up with them<br>and they have to deliver<br>so david murdock did his medical degree<br>through university of otago<br>he then took his postgraduate training<br>in microbiology<br>partly in christchurch partly in<br>liverpool<br>then he ended up at duke university in<br>the united states<br>came back to christchurch about 2000<br>initially primarily employed by the dhb<br>and at various times since then he has<br>also been<br>as well as his university position uh<br>clinical director for the dhb<br>microbiology<br>department<br>in 2002<br>he was appointed though as professor and<br>head of the department of pathology<br>and has done a great job over these 10<br>years with leading this very research<br>strong department within our school so<br>without my do i'll invite david to come<br>up and deliver his belated inaugural<br>professorial lecture on infectious<br>it might be a record i think maybe 10 11<br>years but thank you for the kind<br>introduction and thank you for coming<br>along tonight<br>i'm an infectious<br>diseases doctor<br>and there is my research interest<br>naturally is infectious diseases and<br>tonight i'm going to<br>uh divide my talk into<br>two parts firstly<br>just to talk about some of the unique<br>characteristics of infectious diseases<br>that separate them from or distinguish<br>them from other diseases<br>and then for most of it to talk about<br>christchurch's contribution to research<br>on infectious diseases<br>and for that one i'm going to focus very<br>much on respiratory infections<br>particularly pneumonia<br>and the reason for that are twofold<br>firstly there's a lot of research that's<br>been done in christchurch and now i<br>probably couldn't do justice to all the<br>other research but perhaps more<br>importantly respiratory infection<br>research is really what christchurch has<br>known both nationally and<br>this person<br>was the surgeon general in the united<br>states in the 1960s and he apparently<br>did a very good job made great<br>contributions to the public health of<br>the united states but he is most famous<br>for this quote<br>and says it is time to close the book on<br>infectious diseases and declare the war<br>against pestilence as one and it's quite<br>interesting that you it's very difficult<br>to find the original citation and in<br>fact when william stewart before he died<br>was asked about it he said i can't even<br>remember saying it but anyway there was<br>certainly a number of people at the time<br>held this view including a very<br>prominent infectious disease physician<br>and has extended to the 70s it really<br>was<br>because of the the developments with a<br>lot of new antibiotics and the<br>effectiveness of vaccines and<br>understanding of infectious diseases<br>improving living conditions it was<br>really thought at that time that the<br>battle against infectious disease was<br>was going to be won and that these<br>diseases would be much more of a problem<br>in the future<br>and of course this quite he's this quote<br>is famous because of how wrong it is<br>and this has been widely quoted since<br>since that time and in fact infectious<br>diseases are clearly as important now as<br>they ever have been<br>and this<br>map of the world just shows some of the<br>emerging and re-emerging infections some<br>infections we've known for a long time<br>that have reappeared or some that we<br>didn't know about at all and have<br>suddenly appeared<br>and if you'll notice this is actually 10<br>years old so this is from a paper 10<br>years ago in fact we can add some new<br>antibiotic resistance in india and a new<br>coronavirus that appeared in the middle<br>east causing this and many other<br>infections and this is just the pattern<br>of infectious diseases it changes over<br>time but it's always there and certainly<br>as i said it's as important as it ever<br>and in terms of the burden<br>these are figures from the world health<br>organization about was over 25 percent<br>of deaths over all in the world are<br>caused by infectious diseases and that<br>doesn't take into account some of the<br>chronic complications of infection like<br>heart disease following rheumatic fever<br>or liver cancer following hepatitis b<br>infection<br>and<br>here is ranks some of you can of course<br>cut the pie in different ways but here<br>with this classification<br>consistently respiratory infections<br>which is our big interest and diarrheal<br>diseases come top of the list in terms<br>the big three as we call them an<br>infectious disease hiv tb and malaria<br>these have been the target of funders uh<br>specific target to try<br>and reduce the burden of those<br>infections and quite rightly but if you<br>look if you add that up it's still less<br>than those that die of respiratory<br>infections and if you look further down<br>the list pertussis which is whooping<br>cough<br>that's a respiratory infection<br>measles people who die of measles die of<br>pneumonia that's a respiratory infection<br>so in fact you could it's probably even<br>and if you look at you know what are<br>some of the characteristics of<br>infectious disease that set them apart<br>from other human factors there's<br>actually quite a few<br>and many features that are pretty unique<br>to infectious diseases<br>firstly the potential for unpredictable<br>and explosive global impact<br>think of influenza<br>and you know the the spanish flu of<br>1918-19 of course killed more people<br>than during the first world war led to<br>widespread disturbance all around the<br>world<br>and was still obviously occupies a lot<br>of time in terms of predicting when the<br>next one will happen and how we're<br>prepared for them<br>earlier days of course the plague<br>quite different now in the age of<br>antibiotics but there is still plague in<br>the world in little patches<br>outbreak in india in 1994 caused a lot<br>of panic<br>and it's still<br>uh people think of if it's one of those<br>diseases people<br>uh fear<br>and of course recently we've had<br>intentional<br>um<br>release of of infections and this was if<br>you recall in 2001<br>uh the deliberate release of of anthrax<br>spores and white powder that was posted<br>through the mail system in the us<br>although only 22 people<br>were affected<br>four of those died but the widespread<br>panic across the u.s in particular the<br>stockpiling of antibiotics had a major<br>effect<br>infections are typically caused by<br>a single agent without requirement for<br>multiple cofactors although there are<br>many many exceptions to that so we<br>typically have<br>an algorithm here the bacteria<br>campylobacter causes gastroenteritis a<br>particular problem around canterbury<br>influenza virus<br>causing influenza and these are bacteria<br>the<br>nicer meningitis or meningococcus the<br>cause of meningococcal disease<br>which of course had there was an<br>outbreak in new zealand through the<br>1990s into the last decade<br>infections of course can be transmitted<br>not many diseases can be transmitted<br>and there are many ways you can transmit<br>infectious diseases<br>these of course present a problem in<br>terms of trying to control because they<br>can spread from person to person<br>but also provide opportunities for<br>prevention because if you can actually<br>understand how a disease<br>is transmitted you can<br>develop interventions that will stop<br>that transmission so malaria is<br>transmitted by certain mosquitoes if you<br>eradicate mosquitoes from an area<br>malaria will go away<br>the potential for becoming preventable<br>is very real<br>and of course vaccines vaccines have<br>been one of the most effective and<br>cost-effective public health<br>interventions lead to dramatic reduction<br>in many infectious diseases<br>but this basic sanitation<br>hand washing<br>these have been very effective in<br>controlling many diseases<br>and an insecticide impregnated bed nets<br>to prevent malaria<br>very effective in some parts of the<br>world<br>there's also the potential for<br>eradication although that's really only<br>been achieved for one infection in that<br>smallpox which is a great public health<br>success announced in the 1980s they<br>stopped<br>a war to<br>vaccinate the front the last people as<br>part of that effort which was a<br>amazing achievement<br>and in fact one of the polio viruses<br>hasn't been seen for many years we<br>actually think that one's been<br>eradicated<br>that may be the second one but the hope<br>is that polio be one of the next ones to<br>the pathogens that cause infections have<br>this amazing ability to adapt and always<br>keep ahead of the game<br>and this presents many problems uh and<br>one of the best examples would be with<br>antibiotic resistance<br>and this is a a picture of a stylist<br>picture of a bacterium and here's some<br>examples of how bacterium can develop<br>ways to<br>be become resistant to antibiotics they<br>can develop enzymes that break down the<br>antibiotic<br>they can develop these pumps which will<br>then if the antibiotics get within the<br>cell they'll pump them straight out the<br>valve cell walls that will prevent the<br>antibiotic inside these are some of many<br>examples of the way<br>microorganisms can develop resistance to<br>antimicrobials and this diagram here<br>shows<br>through the last few decades and above<br>here are the new antibiotics that were<br>introduced along the timeline<br>the bottom is the development of<br>resistance to antibiotics<br>and it's pretty much the story with most<br>antibiotic groups that soon after one is<br>introduced we'll start to see evidence<br>of resistance developing in a number of<br>microorganisms i guess the other thing<br>to note here is there's a big gap here<br>we're not seeing a whole lot of new<br>antibiotics been introduced<br>and in fact the drug companies<br>are becoming quite reluctant or less<br>enthusiastic to invest in developing new<br>antimicrobials because it's such a<br>difficult area<br>and the infectious disease society of<br>america have become particularly<br>concerned about that the concern that we<br>may be returning to an era without<br>antibiotics<br>infections of course have a close<br>dependence on human behavior so<br>crowds such as with pilgrimage you know<br>a good environment to transmit various<br>infections and certainly with the harsh<br>meningococcal diseases has been a real<br>problem in the past travellers of course<br>been exposed to<br>infections that they wouldn't otherwise<br>be exposed to maybe don't have immunity<br>to<br>sexual behavior obviously a lot of<br>and the other thing is is association<br>with animals so frequent acquisition<br>from animals or<br>co-evolution with animals and so<br>there are a number of diseases we call<br>them zoonoses<br>and infections that are required from<br>non-human animals probably the most<br>important one<br>in new zealand would be leptospirosis<br>which<br>farmers and freezing workers are exposed<br>to the most common occupational acquired<br>infection in new zealand<br>but animals also have other roles and i<br>think influenza is the best example<br>where whereby pigs for example are<br>they're able to<br>acquire<br>viruses from<br>bird influenza as well as human<br>influenza and they can be used as a kind<br>of a mixing vessel of the different<br>strains of influenza with the risk that<br>one that is more virulent could be could<br>and the whole<br>the vets have been promoting this<br>concept of one health and this is the<br>idea that we shouldn't be looking at<br>animal health and human health and<br>isolation we should be looking at<br>together and with the environment and<br>this is receiving a lot of popular<br>support by various public health<br>institutions around the world it's<br>probably a term that you'll hear more<br>about but in medicine we're catching up<br>but the vets are very very uh hot on<br>this<br>so the rest of my talk i thought i'd<br>just focus on on the workout of<br>christchurch and and<br>as i say i'm going to focus on<br>respiratory infections that's what we're<br>most well known for<br>and i'm going to tell a few stories a<br>few stories of different parts of<br>different aspects of research that's<br>come out of here and i'll highlight<br>different people<br>the key characters along the way<br>and the first one is just really how<br>things start and from my own perspective<br>like so many people my interests came<br>about partly by chance<br>i started training here in christchurch<br>in the early 1990s and there was a lot<br>of work<br>starting up at the time on pneumonia in<br>particular respiratory infections so<br>there were opportunities for<br>young trainees to get involved in<br>research<br>and there were some wonderful<br>opportunities that happened at that time<br>and there's some key people i should<br>mention and um<br>antown of course was a previous dean<br>here respiratory physician and he was<br>instrumental in starting some<br>sentinel pneumonia studies in the 1990s<br>that really led to a lot of the<br>the work that we're currently doing<br>lance jennings who's in the back here is<br>new zealand's<br>expert on influenza and also responsible<br>for<br>the virology<br>laboratory at canterbury health<br>laboratories which is has an<br>international reputation and that really<br>is lance's<br>um a lot to lance's credit steve<br>chambers<br>unfortunately couldn't be here today and<br>i think he wouldn't mind if i said he's<br>the father figure for infectious<br>diseases at the moment in new zealand<br>among practicing<br>uh physicians<br>he started infectious research in<br>christchurch very much so and on a<br>personal level<br>a mentor and a valued colleague<br>as well<br>and throughout the<br>and the other aspect about christchurch<br>christchurch is a fantastic place to do<br>clinical research<br>we're not too big we're not too small<br>we have one catchment<br>health system<br>we have a hospital we have a fantastic<br>laboratory if you don't realize that<br>we've got a top task laboratory<br>in the city and of course we've got the<br>university<br>and many of us work have affiliations<br>for more than one of these parties and<br>uh<br>and generally people get on and it's not<br>just infectious diseases uh this is<br>actually a really really good place to<br>do clinical research that we're really<br>and a lot of the initial work was on<br>pneumonia and those who<br>unfamiliar pneumonia is<br>inflammation of the lung tissue usually<br>due to infections<br>and so here is a this is a microscopic<br>section of normal lung and as you can<br>see there are a lot of gaps there which<br>is which is there so this is these are<br>the air spaces these are the cells<br>around it this is a<br>lung from somebody with pneumonia<br>and so there's been an inflammatory<br>response there's basically a lot of pus<br>cells within the air spaces and it's not<br>hard to imagine and that's going to be<br>difficult to move air around in there<br>and difficult to breathe<br>and this is what it looks like on an<br>x-ray<br>black is air<br>this is the heart here and this here<br>where there's no air this is a patch of<br>pneumonia<br>and pneumonia can be called caused by a<br>wide variety of different organisms and<br>this list is not complete but includes<br>many of the more common ones and i'll<br>just<br>the ones i want to particularly point<br>out um these two bacteria streptococcus<br>pneumoniae which is the most common<br>cause of pneumonia and pretty much every<br>age group around the world and their<br>homophobic influenza and i mentioned<br>those because i'm going to be talking<br>about them later they're very effective<br>vaccines have been developed for both of<br>those agents and they both have a<br>significant cause<br>around the world of pneumonia and<br>now a lot of the work was based around<br>some central pneumonia studies they<br>looked at adults with community acquired<br>pneumonia and this was the first one<br>it's in 1992 1993 alistair neal he was a<br>trainee at the time he's now an<br>associate professor in wellington on a<br>house campus in wellington<br>and this was a study that looked at all<br>adults admitted to christchurch hospital<br>over one year period intensively studied<br>them followed them up did a whole raft<br>of laboratory tests to try and find the<br>cause of pneumonia<br>and there's one very similar a few years<br>later 1999-2000<br>this time led by richard lang who's a<br>again a spirit he was a trainee at the<br>time he's a respiratory physician at<br>christchurch hospital now and this one<br>was a little different it involved<br>waikato hospital in hamilton<br>a larger population and a different<br>ethnic mix with the combined the the two<br>combined sites<br>and there were many um<br>studies that that were fed off these two<br>projects but they had a very similar<br>study design i'm going to run this<br>through some of those<br>uh perhaps some of the major outputs<br>from those studies<br>the first one was there's a real<br>interest at trying to just find out are<br>there ways we can assess the severity of<br>patients with pneumonia when a doctor<br>sees someone coming to hospital is this<br>somebody i need to worry about can i<br>give them oral antibiotics and send them<br>home<br>do i need to go the intensive care unit<br>and there are different efforts around<br>the world to develop simple rules that a<br>house surgeon could use or some way seen<br>the patient as they came into the<br>hospital<br>and this was um there's one that is is<br>called the curb score and it basically<br>has five variables here it is<br>highlighted just needs no confusion<br>there's a blood test<br>there you know the respiratory rate the<br>blood pressure and how old they are<br>and with those five variables<br>you can assess the severity they devise<br>a system that could assess the severity<br>of these patients with pneumonia and in<br>fact this validation study here this<br>paper was one where the data from<br>christchurch was combined with a similar<br>study in the united kingdom and one of<br>the in the netherlands so the three<br>sites<br>and in fact this is used all around the<br>world there are two systems used around<br>the world there's one that comes out of<br>the united states it has 20 different<br>variables and it's very clumsy and isn't<br>used that well and there's this one and<br>this is<br>straight out of the blue book which is<br>the<br>the book that's produced here in<br>christchurch for medical staff with<br>common medical conditions explains how<br>the management of all these conditions<br>this is the page of assessing somebody<br>with pneumonia with the curb age score<br>and i think people have a lot of people<br>forgotten that a lot of that data came<br>from christchurch and this is<br>used throughout the world and derived<br>from those studies<br>there's also looked at clinician<br>behavior um and this was there was an<br>interesting finding that clinicians were<br>reluctant those who were reluctant to<br>change from oral to<br>rather from intravenous antibiotics to<br>oral antibodies kept patients in<br>hospital longer and they didn't do any<br>better from that and so there was a<br>clear message that it was safe to send<br>people home on earlier on oral<br>antibiotics<br>we also produced the first data showing<br>that maori had a much higher incidence<br>of pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia<br>which is the most common type<br>than other population in fact if you<br>look at this graph here which shows the<br>age groups so increasing age and it's a<br>very typical curve with the increasing<br>incidence with age in fact if if we<br>studied children it would go up it's<br>like a u-shaped curve but we only looked<br>at adults<br>and you can see the the the maori<br>instance<br>appears two decades<br>earlier than<br>non-married so<br>but there are also a lot of work about<br>in the laboratory and it really<br>developed canterbury health labs<br>expertise and and a lot of respiratory<br>diagnostics<br>um<br>and just to give an example there's this<br>um<br>tessa this<br>pneumonia is a very difficult um<br>it's very difficult to find the causes<br>of pneumonia<br>other diseases like meningitis and<br>gastroenteritis is quite easy but<br>pneumonia it's actually very difficult<br>mainly because it's difficult to get a<br>specimen of lung<br>and so there's a lot of effort put into<br>looking at alternative testing methods<br>and this one is a very simple one it had<br>a swab you put in a urine from a patient<br>with pneumonia you put it into this<br>device you closed it just like a<br>pregnancy test<br>and two lines for a positive one for a<br>negative result in 15 minutes<br>and this was relatively new in the 1990s<br>and the study<br>that we performed here based were the<br>samples from the second pneumonia study<br>are still that was the the foremost<br>study uh looking at this device and the<br>largest one to date as well<br>and this test again is now used widely<br>throughout the world<br>lastly a study looking at the viral<br>causes of pneumonia typically we think<br>of adults that viruses are a minor cause<br>of pneumonia<br>this was the first day to really<br>extensively look at it with every<br>available test state vr testing methods<br>and with this we were able to show that<br>a third of these adults admitted to<br>hospital here had evidence of a virus<br>and these are the viruses here you may<br>not know the names influenza you'll know<br>but rhinovirus is a common respiratory<br>virus respiratory syncytial virus and<br>others and they're found in about a<br>third of patients so that was the first<br>time that that had been described<br>and more recently uh steve chambers and<br>amy scott thomas here are doing some<br>very innovative work using breath which<br>a number of groups around the world are<br>looking at this with the idea of that if<br>you can capture breath from<br>people with lung infections you may be<br>able to detect certain volatile organic<br>compounds in that breath<br>that may be signatures of certain<br>infections and so this is an exciting<br>new area<br>my next story<br>and this is one that leads directly from<br>the early pneumonia studies in<br>christchurch<br>and<br>this is a from that first paper that<br>came out the first study in 1992 1993<br>and these are the list of of<br>uh organisms that were the causes of<br>pneumonia that were described as part of<br>that study so pneuma streptococcus<br>pneumoniae the bacteria is top of the<br>list and this is the most common cause<br>of demand very expected result<br>but the unexpected result was this one<br>this bacteria called legionella was very<br>common 11 of all the patients and in<br>fact we went back with more<br>sophisticated test letter on it and it<br>was actually probably double that in<br>that population we detected it<br>the same number again<br>and<br>legionella of course is the bacterium<br>that causes legionnaires disease<br>so this was the start of the whole<br>interest in legionnaires that started in<br>christchurch you may or may not know it<br>but certainly in new zealand<br>christchurch is the capital of<br>legionnaires these in fact it's probably<br>in the world at the moment with our<br>incidence of legionnaires disease<br>so this is uh typically it's not always<br>typically a severe pneumonia caused by<br>legionella bacteria obviously several<br>species the one that causes most disease<br>around the world we call these now<br>pneumophila<br>and this is an organism that likes water<br>and typically legionnaires disease if<br>you see descriptions around the world<br>it's most commonly described in<br>outbreaks<br>and these outbreaks were associated with<br>a contaminated water source like a a<br>cooling tower or in melbourne a few<br>years ago they had one with the aquarium<br>uh in the middle of the city<br>it's unusual in the fact that there's no<br>human to human transmission you can't<br>get it from somebody else you can only<br>get it from the environment<br>it's roughly resistant to many<br>antibiotics that we use so the first<br>line antibiotics we tend to use for<br>pneumonia the penicillins are not active<br>against legionnaires disease<br>it's also difficult to diagnose because<br>you need special tests<br>so for all these reasons it's difficult<br>to diagnose<br>it doesn't respond to normal antibiotics<br>it's acquired from the environment<br>and it causes severe disease these are<br>important and quite different from a lot<br>of other causes of pneumonia<br>of course the first description you may<br>have heard of it was in 1976 it was a<br>american legion convention there's a<br>return servicemen and<br>what was called it changed its name<br>after that but it was the bellevue<br>stratford hotel in downtown philadelphia<br>and this was a convention of these<br>return servicemen of which two over 200<br>were affected and 34 died it was quite a<br>major<br>major incidence and was linked to the<br>air conditioning in that building<br>it's now recognized that<br>it causes<br>a much broader spectrum of disease<br>doesn't have to be severe disease<br>and despite people's efforts it really<br>cannot be distinguished clinically or by<br>x-ray from any other cause of pneumonia<br>so the clinicians when they see patients<br>with vg and these things based on their<br>presenting just can't tell from from<br>other causes of pneumonia and that's<br>quite important<br>now since that time we've done a lot of<br>work in legionnaires disease we've done<br>a lot of work with diagnostic tests we<br>test more than anywhere else we've had<br>innovative ways that we we look at it in<br>christchurch<br>and the picture is quite different we<br>know a lot about it we know a lot about<br>the what happens and we there a lot that<br>we still don't know about it but it is<br>different from that typical<br>the outbreak that was first described<br>and was usually described elsewhere in<br>the world<br>outbreaks are very rare almost<br>non-existent<br>but 85 of cases are due to this other<br>species called legionnaire long beachy<br>which unlike pneumothorax water it's<br>it occurs in these seasonal outbreaks in<br>spring summer so i know that after labor<br>weekend people will start coming in the<br>door here at the hospital through<br>november we have this massive peak<br>peter's out over december and through to<br>march every year very very predictable<br>much more predictable than influenza<br>it's a very strong association with<br>gardening<br>and<br>for most of the year at least rather<br>half of the year it is the most common<br>cause identified cause of pneumonia in<br>the city of people admitted to hospital<br>and it is severe so this is local<br>local data one third of cases end up in<br>the intensive care and 10 time<br>now if you told that to people around<br>the world about the how common is they<br>won't believe you and it's really is<br>quite different from that described<br>elsewhere<br>including we look harder and that's part<br>we actually don't believe we're unique<br>and particularly around new zealand um<br>i'm sure there are many other places<br>just if you don't look you don't find<br>and we we look very very hard in<br>christchurch<br>and in fact we've got a<br>a novel<br>way we go about that testing because you<br>cannot pick it up clinically<br>we<br>we talked to the clinician say look<br>isn't it easy if we just rather you<br>ordering<br>the tests on people you think have<br>legion is these knowing that you can't<br>pick for cases shouldn't we just be<br>testing everyone has pneumonia<br>because it's so common and the<br>clinicians are very supportive of that<br>we managed to put the business case<br>to the labs that we should do this we<br>use the most sensitive tests which we<br>call pcr<br>which we've done a lot of development<br>work here in christchurch on and so<br>basically regardless of what the<br>clinicians want to say if there's a<br>indication on the form that comes to the<br>lab the patient has pneumonia we'll do<br>the test<br>and this is what has happened we<br>evaluated we this is uh 2008 2012 end of<br>2010 with the arrows this is when we<br>started doing that<br>these are the number of cases of<br>legionnaire's disease over those four<br>years two years before two years after<br>and basically we quadrupled the number<br>of cases that were identified in<br>christchurch<br>very clear seasonal peaks in fact i can<br>tell you they've continued for two more<br>peaks after that<br>so i know you're waiting to know about<br>what the story is with potting mix um<br>and this is an interesting story and<br>then and of course<br>most people associate legionnaires in<br>new zealand with potting mix and the<br>story basically goes<br>people who are who have legionnaires<br>these have disproportionately report<br>contact with potting mix<br>if you culture some of the potting mix<br>you'll find legionella in it<br>absolutely yet and in fact we've got<br>some information that<br>gardening is a greater risk factor in<br>potting mix per se so the potting mix<br>story may be only part of it<br>it probably is part of it but it's<br>probably not the whole story and there<br>may be other factors associated with<br>gardening so we have now a number of<br>studies underway where um have a case<br>control study<br>a master student in the canadians doing<br>that over this current season looking at<br>the risk factors for legionella<br>infection will hope to get a better<br>signal um that it may be some other<br>gardening activity<br>the industry have been very very<br>responsible and they've come to us<br>maybe a problem with our product we want<br>to solve this so we're working with them<br>to do some nationwide survey of compost<br>products<br>we<br>are looking at nationwide surveillance<br>for legionnaires these because again we<br>don't think it's just a christchurch<br>problem and our colleagues out<br>throughout the country are very<br>interested in this and then tony walls<br>here in christchurch is looking at<br>legionnaires these and children which<br>has been under<br>um virtually nothing on it in children<br>just adults and so there's no ongoing<br>project at the moment<br>so you'll hear more about this in the<br>the next story this one<br>is a story a few of us embark entered a<br>world<br>a completely new world a few years ago<br>the world of vitamins a rather exciting<br>world and this was the vitamin we were<br>interested in was vitamin d<br>and you may have heard a lot of the<br>discussion there's a lot of discussion<br>currently about vitamin d and its health<br>benefits and if you believe<br>and this is uh if you wade through the<br>the science and non-science there seems<br>to be a many many benefits to vitamin d<br>which is a a hormone that has effects in<br>multiple different parts of the body<br>but if you believe this it has vitamin d<br>will prevent all types of cancer high<br>blood pressure osteoporosis records<br>depression diabetes heart disease<br>and<br>the one that we were interested in<br>because there was a lot made of it was<br>it prevented respiratory<br>infections<br>and<br>a number of<br>low quality studies<br>that found that people who had certain<br>infections seem to have low levels of<br>vitamin d but whether that was linked or<br>not it was hard to know<br>the link within infection is actually<br>quite plausible<br>there are many ways that vitamin d may<br>affect the immune system in the body<br>making people more susceptible to<br>infections so deficiency may make people<br>more you know it is plausible<br>but everyone was saying well we need<br>good quality studies so a few years ago<br>we just said well actually<br>we could do that sort of study<br>and we thought we'd do a randomized<br>controlled trial of vitamin d now we<br>would like to have done it in pneumonia<br>but we've had a huge number<br>of cases of rather of participants to<br>give vitamin d or placebo to see how<br>many water wouldn't get pneumonia so we<br>focused on something much more common<br>the common cold but people have two to<br>three episodes a year we thought well<br>this is something we can do the health<br>research council<br>it defund us and and i think many people<br>in this room were actual participants in<br>their study<br>and we called it the vidara study<br>we looked at over 300 healthy adults new<br>zealanders were basically staff and<br>students of this campus and the hospital<br>board<br>we gave them vitamin d monthly or<br>placebo they didn't know which they had<br>we didn't know<br>which whether they had vitamin d placebo<br>until after the study was completed we<br>followed everyone up for 18 months over<br>two winters and the main things we<br>looked at were the number of colds how<br>severe the colds were<br>number of days of work<br>off work due to the colds number of<br>times that we detected a virus during a<br>and this is this graph shows the blue<br>are the people who have placebo the red<br>of the people are the vitamin d and this<br>is their blood tests which we did<br>afterwards<br>uh and it showed you those who had the<br>vitamin d clearly had higher levels of<br>of vitamin d in their blood and those<br>that had the placebo didn't so it was<br>always nice to see that the placebo is<br>really placebo and the drug is really<br>drug<br>the starting point here and one thing<br>that is important to note is<br>the the baseline levels of vitamin d<br>we're expecting quite a few people to<br>have very low levels in fact there<br>weren't as many as we thought and that<br>may have affected our results as i<br>mentioned in a minute<br>and this slide here is a very busy table<br>that shows the main results but i can<br>basically summarize it by saying there<br>was absolutely no effect there was no<br>difference between those who took<br>vitamin d and those who took placebo<br>number of colds the severity of colds<br>under the days off work<br>amazingly similar so there's absolutely<br>no difference and this week included<br>that the monthly dosing and this group<br>of healthy relatively non-deficient<br>vitamin d deficient adults had no effect<br>and this was actually what was being<br>promoted everyone should have vitamin d<br>um<br>and that we really should focus on<br>people who were deficient they were the<br>population that may benefit from vitamin<br>d<br>and sometimes these negative effects<br>studies are quite difficult to publish<br>but<br>the journal of the american medical<br>association took it up<br>okay and put in the company editorial<br>and<br>i mean this was blew me away if you name<br>it every paper in the world covered it<br>every newspaper in the world covered<br>this uh covered our study<br>bbc had it um a colleague whose sister<br>in denmark sent the newspaper across<br>with a result we've got massive exposure<br>it was reported as<br>relatively responsibly you know and<br>accurately in these papers but it was<br>interesting the response from the<br>zealots of course there are many zealots<br>in the vitamin world and both those who<br>are scientists as well as the the<br>non-scientists and it was actually the<br>scientists that surprised us most in<br>terms of their disbelief and our results<br>and i even was asked to talk at a<br>conference in the us and they ended up<br>in front of this kind of<br>talk show<br>so you can find me on youtube talking<br>about the study it was actually quite<br>astounding and i as i'll speak in a<br>minute<br>it's been a lot of time focused on<br>childhood pneumonia in the developing<br>world the biggest killer of kids you try<br>and get the media's attention it's a lot<br>more difficult than a negative study in<br>and just one other just to finish off<br>talking about the vidarasa this was<br>actually our timeline now<br>any christchurch resident will know what<br>happened during this time and of course<br>the study period we had<br>all of the earthquake activity and i<br>think one thing was<br>really remarkable about the study is our<br>compliance was amazing remained<br>amazingly high<br>we hardly missed a beat<br>and we completed all the deadlines were<br>completed on time and i think that's a<br>real credit to one of the participants<br>but also to the study team and i would<br>just just i study i know sandy's in the<br>audience so sandy slow who was a study<br>coordinator extraordinaire and<br>team which comprised a number of<br>research<br>assistants who were out there despite<br>personal<br>hardship<br>and high damage times and we're<br>interviewing people on the streets who<br>are afraid to come into buildings<br>uh it was quite remarkable so i really<br>really have to give credit to a<br>i live in a i have a kind of strange i<br>live in really two worlds in a way that<br>intersect a little bit and and i've<br>talked about a lot of the studies which<br>have been based largely in in<br>christchurch and principally focused on<br>adults but the other other world i live<br>in is focused on children and in<br>developing countries<br>and for the rest of the the talk i'll be<br>mainly focusing on this aspect<br>this is actually the picture of<br>pneumonia for most of the world<br>it's children it's not adults and so<br>here's a little boy in kathmandu and<br>here's this little baby and her mother<br>and marley<br>and you know this is this is the picture<br>uh for most people would see with<br>pneumonia<br>pneumonia is the biggest killer of young<br>kids in the world<br>and these are the latest who figures you<br>can see that of the predicted seven to<br>eight million childhood deaths per year<br>that was in 2010<br>about 18<br>1.4 million were caused by pneumonia<br>and it's disproportionately affects the<br>poorest parts of the world um these are<br>where these dots represent this is quite<br>an old slide but you get the idea that<br>this is where the the concentration of<br>childhood deaths is very unusual for a<br>child to die of pneumonia in new zealand<br>whereas it's very common in many places<br>and in actual fact half of them occur in<br>five countries<br>so india nigeria drc afghanistan and<br>pakistan<br>and<br>this doesn't hit the headlines very<br>often and unicef and who really put a<br>lot of effort in the last few years to<br>raise awareness and this was a document<br>that was put out a few years ago you may<br>need a forgotten killer of children<br>and it really focused on you know<br>efforts to um<br>to control pneumonia<br>and<br>these are based around<br>these sorts of interventions protecting<br>a child through encouraging<br>breastfeeding<br>and good nutrition<br>preventing them developing pneumonia<br>through vaccination preventing hiv<br>infection<br>and those who do get unwell to have<br>early diagnosis and treatment<br>and so there's been lots of efforts to<br>try and<br>attack it from these different ways<br>and this paul said this too the person<br>who really got me<br>interested in<br>children into the world of children<br>because i'm an adult physician by<br>background it's this guy andy pollard<br>and nandy and i have now been friends<br>for over 20 years and the friendship<br>that developed through the mountains a<br>very interesting story<br>and i in fact it was<br>i wrote a letter criticized in an<br>article that he had written and it<br>happened that we had a<br>mutual acquaintance we didn't know who<br>put us together after that but we've<br>been friends for many years andy's an<br>english<br>pediatrician<br>he's now the um<br>a professor at oxford heads the oxford<br>vaccine group which is one of the<br>largest vaccine research groups in the<br>world<br>he's uh it's a group that's received<br>over 30 million euros in funding over<br>the last five years it's a very very<br>successful group and andy's a very<br>prominent figure in the in the vaccine<br>world and pediatric infectious diseases<br>in our work<br>work has<br>been based in kathmandu and nepal is the<br>country that i have a long association<br>with<br>and<br>started some the research<br>first researcher did this started back<br>in 2001 and we<br>have been working in this hospital<br>called patton hospital one of three<br>general hospitals in kathmandu the<br>capital city<br>and the first study was actually on<br>adults and it was a study that started<br>when i was we started planning for it<br>when i was working in the us at duke<br>university and got some funding from the<br>u.s centers for disease control<br>in response to a request just to find<br>out the causes of febrile illness of<br>illness with<br>fever<br>among<br>adults at this hospital<br>and it's been an amazingly well cited<br>paper one the first two<br>to document some of the very<br>fundamental information about infections<br>in kathmandu the importance of of<br>typhoid fever the importance of<br>leptospirosis and typhus<br>but when i when we were there um<br>the chief of pediatrics in the middle<br>there that's nila matakari she's a<br>professor of pediatrics a fantastic<br>clinician<br>very charismatic woman and she said to<br>me david look you know<br>can't ignore the children like we want<br>to know this information as well and in<br>particular i want to know you know what<br>is the burden of<br>we know<br>we know the clinical presentations<br>largely but we are laboratory we just<br>don't have the resources to do a<br>laboratory testing and particularly we<br>want to know<br>what are the illnesses that could what<br>is the burden of disease that we can<br>prevent with vaccines and how can we<br>persuade the government and get the<br>resources to implement the vaccines in<br>the country so there are some pretty big<br>questions<br>and so andy and iva<br>cobbled together various sorts of<br>funding over many years and we've put<br>together a number of studies<br>all based around reinforcing<br>the laboratory services and<br>this is one of the<br>fantastic laboratory staff from this<br>hospital but uh lacking the resources to<br>actually do a lot of the testing so<br>sabina dongle who is a one of the chief<br>microbiologists who just completed a phd<br>at oxford<br>and uh and in fact he'd come over here<br>to do some training a few years ago as<br>well she and and others um part of a lot<br>of<br>projects there<br>and providing for the infrastructure and<br>the ability to do the extra laboratory<br>testing so just to give you an idea of<br>some of the work that we've done what we<br>children presenting with fever very<br>similar to what we did with the adult<br>study a few years before and we looked<br>at over 2000 children and over nearly<br>two years<br>a very simple study just describing<br>their presentation which organisms which<br>were causing the infections some very<br>very basic stuff and<br>as you can see pneumonia was very<br>prominent i mean they knew that but it<br>was well documented in the study typhoid<br>fever was very common meningitis was<br>common and malnutrition was very common<br>we did a similar study on outpatients as<br>well about a thousand outpatients<br>and our patients in kathmandu really is<br>like a general practice people don't<br>have general practitioners they just<br>bowl up to the outpatients at the<br>hospital<br>and so these were the some of the<br>presentations we looked at summer and<br>winter in this study<br>typhoid was more common during the<br>monsoon we knew that pneumonia was<br>common both seasons upper respiratory<br>infections like colds were more common<br>during the winter<br>and one of the remarkable findings was<br>that we did we took blood from all the<br>children and tried to grow bacteria in<br>the blood we took blood cultures these<br>were outpatients sixteen percent had a<br>bacteria in their blood and were managed<br>without patients normally this is<br>something we admit<br>people for in christchurch and these<br>were managed in the community most of<br>them have typhoid fever<br>we did a number of studies really<br>focused on these two<br>bacteria i mentioned before streptococci<br>hemophilus and fluency studies of<br>children in the community were they<br>carrying these organisms and therefore<br>at risk of infection what types they did<br>they have would they be covered by the<br>vaccines that were around we also did<br>some studies with with the vaccines<br>giving the vaccine to some children just<br>to see that they mounted an immune<br>response to it always providing<br>background information leading to<br>hopefully the implementation of the<br>vaccine in the country and all the time<br>working with the ministry of health<br>which is<br>important<br>and so in summary we're over many<br>studies are able to show that pneumonia<br>and actually meningitis were common that<br>pneumococcal and amorphous influenzae<br>were important causes of pneumonia that<br>the strains around were the type that<br>will be covered by the vaccine and that<br>the vaccines were semi efficacious and<br>inducing an immune response<br>and so<br>to our delight and i think this in terms<br>of applied research seen that research<br>come from<br>with that with a<br>seen it go through from the fundamental<br>uh collecting fundamental information<br>through to<br>implementation of policy has been a you<br>know absolute pleasure with this this<br>work and so this was just announced that<br>the pneumococcal vaccine was going to be<br>introduced<br>in kathmandu latest you're actually<br>probably going to be early next year<br>it's a very very satisfying<br>given all the work we've done and we've<br>also just got<br>some funding from the global alliance<br>and vaccines and immunisations to do an<br>impact study in kathmandu as well so<br>that would be something we're working<br>over next few years because it's<br>important just to see<br>the effect of the vaccine and make sure<br>that it is is suitable for the<br>population<br>next story is a<br>slightly different one and i was<br>approached in 2009 by<br>this or in levine this guy in the middle<br>who was a then at the time professor of<br>a professor at johns hopkins school of<br>public health somebody that i'd<br>worked with on number of projects had<br>been involved in a<br>funding body that had funded some of our<br>projects in nepal<br>and he contacted me and said david we've<br>just got 40 million dollars from the<br>bill and melinda gates foundation to do<br>a pneumonia study it's going to be the<br>biggest pneumonia study the world's ever<br>seen<br>it's going to be under the watch of bill<br>gates we need somebody to lead the lab<br>stuff would you<br>would you mind do you want are you<br>interested and of course i said<br>sure but i'm not moving to baltimore and<br>um he said fine and<br>so<br>the study<br>and so<br>basically the study has<br>undergone that this is a year later the<br>core study group from the<br>from the the study in a meeting in<br>jerusalem<br>and the study is it's called the perch<br>project and oren<br>is a keen fisherman and i think the<br>acronym was very much fish in mind<br>that's what the perch project<br>and this is um stands for the pneumonia<br>etiology research for child health<br>etiology means cause so it's it's it's a<br>project that is really focused on<br>finding out the causes of childhood<br>pneumonia in developing countries<br>and oren<br>halfway through the study<br>was recruited by the funders so he's now<br>changed and he's now the head of vaccine<br>delivery of the bill and melinda gates<br>foundation and the principal<br>investigator role was taken over by kate<br>o'brien<br>and i really highlight these two people<br>because these are two extraordinary<br>individuals some of the cleverest people<br>i know<br>kate's a canadian she now works at johns<br>hopkins and is a pediatrician there very<br>a major figure in the world the vaccine<br>world and over this project they've both<br>become very close friends and it's real<br>um you know real pleasure as part of the<br>study to get to know<br>a wonderful group of people including<br>these two<br>the aims of perch are fairly<br>straightforward<br>want to look at the cause of severe<br>pneumonia young children from developing<br>countries and the idea is that most of<br>the information on causes is is really<br>old it's using techniques that are<br>obsolete or it doesn't<br>on the flip side doesn't use some more<br>state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques<br>so<br>and in terms of funders like the gates<br>foundation it's important information to<br>know<br>uh where to direct their future efforts<br>you know should they put money toward<br>developing a vaccine against organism x<br>is it common enough to is it causing um<br>that much of a problem<br>and so the ultimate aim is to provide<br>information to improve policies for<br>pneumonia prevention and treatment<br>we<br>the study design is a case control study<br>we have seven study sites in africa and<br>asia<br>we look at hospitalized children<br>those that consent to be part of the<br>study or intensively investigated a<br>number of diagnostic tests we collect a<br>lot of information clinical information<br>we follow them for a month<br>and check their outcome after a month<br>and we're using some fairly<br>sophisticated statistical modelling to<br>try and<br>assess the burden of disease with all<br>these different<br>causes different microorganisms<br>our target was about four thousand cases<br>as of two hours ago i found out we'd<br>actually stopped recruiting so the study<br>after two years has stopped when we've<br>achieved over a target so over four<br>thousand children in those seven<br>countries<br>and<br>these were chosen from the catchment<br>area of each of the the hospitals<br>we also have controls they're the same<br>age they reside in the same catchment<br>areas<br>the children with pneumonia and these<br>children have no evidence of pneumonia<br>that's basically the only thing we ask<br>of them<br>and why do we need controls<br>well it's very important to have<br>controls when you're looking at the<br>trying to assess the various diagnostic<br>tests it's important to note if you're<br>detecting something in the cases but not<br>the controls that is much more<br>significant than something then<br>some situations we're also detecting an<br>organism in the in the case in the<br>controls<br>also for the risk factor analysis you<br>can't assess risk factors if you unless<br>you have a control group of of people<br>without<br>the disease in question<br>where the sites um we had 52<br>applications for the to be part of the<br>study and we chose seven science or<br>maybe broadly representative of the<br>pneumonia burden around the world so we<br>have five from<br>five from africa gambia mali kenya<br>zambia and south africa and two sites<br>in<br>in asia big big missions we have no<br>india we have no nigeria which is the<br>most populous country in africa<br>and that was simply because of the the<br>quality of the applications from those<br>sites<br>bangladesh<br>should<br>be<br>the results should be very similar<br>throughout south asia and in fact<br>nigeria some of the other we've got some<br>other uh regional studies so they're<br>probably not major deficiencies<br>some are have a high hiv prevalence<br>zambia in south africa others have a low<br>hiv prevalence some are urban and some<br>are rural<br>so they go from the slums of dhaka in in<br>bangladesh to very rural<br>populations like here in basai which is<br>in the very<br>and<br>one of my jobs my main job is is is to<br>look after all the laboratory testing<br>which is really caught of this study and<br>and it was a um<br>certainly the<br>desire of the funders and also of the<br>investigators that as much testing as<br>possible gets done on site because all<br>of these sites already have quite a lot<br>of experience and diagnostic testing<br>some more than others and so one of my<br>jobs was to standardize that testing<br>across the seven sites<br>and the reasons why i've had many many<br>sleepless nights in doing so but it's<br>been a big big challenge but a very<br>important part of the study<br>now as i say we've just completed in<br>fact it went on a little longer some<br>sites because of<br>where civil disturbances etc went on a<br>bit longer and we had to follow them up<br>for a month afterwards<br>so we've already just completed so i<br>can't show you any results obviously at<br>the moment because we're going through<br>the analysis phase this year but just to<br>give you a kind of an i think this is a<br>very sobering slide this was<br>data from a few months ago and it shows<br>the case fatality rate in other words<br>the proportion of children who die<br>and of the cases and as you can see and<br>we've divided them into severe and very<br>severe pneumonia there are criteria that<br>you can distinguish those too<br>but as you can see zambia<br>over 20 percent of the children in the<br>study died which is awful absolutely<br>awful and it was quite a difference<br>and i think just a bit of a hint<br>the traditional view about pneumonia is<br>that most cases are probably caused by<br>one pathogen to clear bacteria and that<br>possibly<br>is incorrect and i think what we'll be<br>concluding in the end is actually it's a<br>it's multiple organisms and particularly<br>bacteria and viruses working hand in<br>hand causing pneumonia whether perhaps<br>the virus setting the scene for the<br>bacteria to cause the pneumonia and<br>assuming that's something that we'll be<br>working on i think is a very attractive<br>hypothesis<br>and needless to say there are many many<br>um<br>institutions involved but it may be<br>interested to know that i'm not the only<br>new zealand connection it's surprisingly<br>uh the numbers of new zealanders<br>involved so i lead the laboratory team<br>the principal investigating the gambia<br>is an auckland pediatrician called steve<br>howie susan morpeth leads the lab in<br>kenya she was a former trainee here in<br>christchurch in infectious diseases nick<br>fancourt's an otago graduate<br>pediatrician fulbright scholar johns<br>hopkins who's doing a phd on the x-ray<br>changes in these children in the study<br>and john crump is professor<br>international health and dunedin's on<br>our expert group and canterbury health<br>laboratories<br>is the main reference lab for the whole<br>state in fact pretty much all the<br>specimens will be i will be arriving<br>across the road<br>over the next few months<br>for for specialized testing<br>and i've just only got one slide but i<br>couldn't talk about child pneumonia<br>without actually just highlighting the<br>fact that we have a problem in this<br>country as well<br>and you would have heard the discussions<br>about<br>child poverty and the concerns about<br>child poverty and increasing child<br>poverty and infectious diseases follow<br>poverty and it is really appalling that<br>we have any cases of rheumatic fever in<br>new zealand<br>um<br>let's learn the skin and soft tissue<br>infection rates we see particularly in<br>the north island so<br>i think we do have to<br>keep this on politicians<br>in their mind and especially in election<br>year because this is really important<br>and shows the increasing inequalities in<br>i'm going to finish with my final little<br>tale it's not really tail it's just<br>really a comment and<br>it's really<br>i've talked about a number of projects<br>around the world but really the<br>the strongest collaborations most<br>successful collaborations have been ones<br>which have been really<br>built around friendships and very very<br>strong personal friendships with<br>colleagues around the world and<br>and the opportunity to get to know<br>people and about respect for people and<br>and this has been one of the most<br>satisfying parts of my research career<br>number of people around the world who i<br>know and interact with fascinating<br>people in different environments<br>and uh the perch project is is amazing i<br>mean the people are<br>incredibly hard workers exceptionally<br>high standards very very demanding<br>but will also<br>also very good at trying to get a<br>work-life balance and so there's a lot<br>of so when we get together there are<br>also a lot of social<br>events and a lot of time out and<br>you know it is<br>a wonderful group to interact with<br>and as part of this i started something<br>a few years ago that kind of i never<br>anticipated where it would go but as<br>some of you know i<br>i make musical instruments guitars and<br>ukuleles<br>in particular and i started giving a few<br>years ago i gave one to andy pollard and<br>another friend an iceland colleague and<br>and it's sort of taken off from then and<br>i've made quite a few instruments uh for<br>various some of the collaborators i have<br>around the world and<br>you know you need to be a good friend to<br>be ukulele-worthy really and<br>so these are<br>doing that and i've produced quite a few<br>for various people and the perch<br>project they have a little perch in<br>laden power on the 12th fret of the<br>fretboard as a pert series and now in my<br>effort to populate the world with<br>ukuleles i now have them in<br>a number of places and the trouble is<br>i've now started near so many other<br>people i need to do it for and i'm way<br>behind but it's actually been quite a ah<br>i guess it's it's been a curiosity i<br>guess and i've been quite a wonderful<br>way to um share friendship and uh um<br>but those observer that's not in the<br>middle of that that is actually in<br>iceland i do have one of my ukuleles is<br>an iceland icelandic friend<br>now just to finish i there are<br>too many people to acknowledge and i<br>hope throughout it i've<br>mentioned um<br>i've tried to show the names and mention<br>a lot of people and i wasn't going to<br>list them here because i was afraid i'd<br>miss out but i do just mention the<br>funders and<br>i've been a number of funders of our<br>work over time and i hope i've<br>remembered them all<br>but last night my wife remembered i<br>should thank my family as well<br>absolutely so i am um and you could say<br>needlessly you need to think that's not<br>right you do need to thank your family<br>and<br>i have a wonderfully supportive family<br>who are able to put up with the ups and<br>downs of the research and my absences<br>with the frequent travel particularly<br>with the perch project<br>and my final slide is a photograph i<br>took in mali and um in bamako the<br>capital of mali and i<br>i often look at this photograph and this<br>reminds me of you know what's why we're<br>doing this really and think of these<br>kids who spend a lot of our time trying<br>to improve their health so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
