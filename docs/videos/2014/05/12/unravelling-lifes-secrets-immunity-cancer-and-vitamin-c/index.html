automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>atago good evening ladies and<br>gentlemen uh welcome to tonight's Public<br>Health lecture clearly we have some very<br>keen people in the audience to come out<br>on a night like this when you could have<br>been sitting in front of your fire if<br>you're AOW one uh keeping warm rather<br>than braving the weather for people who<br>don't know me I'm Peter Joyce I'm dean<br>of the University of otago Christ Church<br>and it's my pleasure to uh chair the<br>series of public lectures that we do<br>this year as last year all of these<br>public lectures are also in augural<br>professorial lectures which is a long<br>tradition in in the university for when<br>people are newly appointed as professors<br>that they have to do the inaugural<br>lecture now Margaret VES did her first<br>science degree through the University of<br>Canterbury and came on to a university<br>of aaga TR she do her Masters and PhD<br>she's been on staff for quite a number<br>of years uh and I'm sure she would<br>prefer I don't say how many years uh<br>she's been uh employed here uh in 2013<br>she was promoted to uh professor in<br>recognition of her research over many<br>years here uh I think a key person in<br>the in Margaret's development has been<br>Professor Christine winterborn who<br>supervised her PhD and has been a<br>colleague over many years so now hand<br>over to margarite to deliver tonight's<br>Margaret thanks very much Peter and it's<br>not going to be a secret much longer um<br>first of all I'd just like to thank um<br>all of you for coming out uh tonight um<br>I'm working on the assumption that<br>everyone in this room is here because<br>they absolutely want to be here and so I<br>feel privileged to be able to um spend<br>the next we while telling you something<br>about um my work and the things that um<br>I'm interested in and hopefully that<br>you'll be interested in<br>too um when I was looking at starting um<br>the this talk I was thinking you really<br>need I want to take you there's a story<br>I want to tell and so I really need to<br>start at the beginning and I did um have<br>trouble finding a school girl photo of<br>myself um in my impeccable filing system<br>at home um and so um this was the only<br>one I could lay my hands on and it's of<br>me um in about year seven when I was<br>about 12 or maybe maybe 11 or 12 and and<br>believe me this is a dress up we didn't<br>normally go to school looking like this<br>um so this was a dress up occasion but<br>the reason I want to start with a school<br>photo is that when I was at school and<br>at high school I had a dream of becoming<br>a scientist and I remember thinking when<br>I was at Secondary School would it be<br>possible to do science as a career and<br>would would you be able to do this as a<br>job because this would be amazing and so<br>I'm here today to tell you that that<br>dream came true for me and we and it<br>seen me through to more wonderful things<br>and so at the end of X number of years<br>you get to do great things like this so<br>now I still get to dress up but I get to<br>dress up and things that I'm publicizing<br>wonderful work so we made a dress out of<br>a poster um from our students work so um<br>but but this is a story that of of<br>really of the things that um excite and<br>um keep us going um in the very<br>difficult world of<br>science so when you're a research<br>scientist it's great fun so you get to<br>play with some amazing toys so we have<br>um wonderful machines that can do<br>fantastic things they're also fantastic<br>people to work with and sometimes we get<br>to dress<br>up but what we think about where all the<br>action is really is up here and what we<br>think about is we're trying to<br>understand the cause of disease and so<br>you can think about it like this so what<br>we do what you might do is you might go<br>to the doctor and you say I'm feeling<br>terrible and he'll say you've got<br>therosis of the liver well we ask<br>why have you got therosis of the liver<br>what's going on with these cells what is<br>therosis of the<br>liver and not only what's going on in<br>the whole liver but each one of those<br>cells has a whole intricate machinery<br>and so we want to know what what is it<br>in that cell that's making your liver<br>sick and not only in the Machinery of<br>the cell but right down to the protein<br>level so each one of those cells you<br>become sick because something goes wrong<br>with the proteins in the cells in your<br>body and we're trying to understand the<br>link between that and the clinic so<br>we're trying to make sense of the<br>illness so that we can provide better<br>behaviors so in in telling you this<br>story I've got a number of topics I want<br>to range through and I thought it's a<br>little bit difficult conceptually so I'm<br>going to take you on a tour through my<br>virtual house and so we're going to<br>visit a number of rooms and in the first<br>room I share the first room with these<br>characters here so these are my<br>long-standing colleagues in the center<br>for free radical research Christine<br>winterborn Tony K and Mark Hampton and<br>we've been working together for a long<br>time and it's a wonderful working<br>partnership<br>um but in this<br>room there are other there are two other<br>people one of them has arthritis and one<br>has<br>pneumonia and so this is to illustrate<br>that these are this is the topic of our<br>research so we broadly cover the reasons<br>why this person gets arthritis and why<br>this person gets pneumonia and both of<br>these conditions are a result of<br>inflammation either chronic or acute and<br>if you were to look I want you to<br>remember this picture of of a lung with<br>pneumonia so in a normal healthy lung<br>you've got lots of open Airways and in a<br>pneumonia lung you've got a blocked part<br>so this in this part the air can't get<br>in and so this is what you might see on<br>an X-ray but we would ask what's going<br>on<br>there and that brings us to<br>the cell of<br>interest um which in this case is the<br>nutrifil which is one of our white blood<br>cells and probably um it's makes up half<br>of our circulating white blood cells and<br>it's the first cell to respond in in an<br>infection and<br>so they circulate these cells they<br>circulate in your bloodstream you can<br>see them here this is a section through<br>a blood vessel and they often sit on the<br>side of the blood vessel because most of<br>the infections and inflammation happens<br>in your tissues not in your blood so<br>these cells have got to get out and they<br>here they receive signals when there's<br>something wrong in the tissues and they<br>migrate through the tissues and then<br>through through the wall of the blood<br>vessel and into the tissues and that's<br>where they carry out their business and<br>their business is this so fundamentally<br>these cells are our bacterial and<br>pathogen killers that the First<br>Responders to infection and they do this<br>here's a picture of one cell here<br>engulfing a bacterium they do this by<br>literally swallowing that bacterium and<br>killing it inside themselves now this<br>process has been known for quite a long<br>time a very long time in fact and it was<br>this man Ilia mechnikov who first saw<br>this phenomenon happening down the<br>microscope and he called it<br>phagocytosis and he saw it happening in<br>a starfish<br>Lara and and realized that this this<br>process is common across most<br>organisms and so if we look at a cartoon<br>diagram of that so this is a slice<br>through a<br>nutrifil the process that happens is<br>that the bacterium gets taken up and<br>when it's inside it's enclosed in a<br>particle so it's<br>completely removed from the outside of<br>the cell and the inside<br>of the neutr and the neutr is full of<br>these things called granules that<br>contain toxic enzymes and things that<br>can kill bacteria the nutrifil empties<br>that into that compartment kills the bug<br>and then digests it up into all its<br>component parts and so it recycles the<br>bad things in your body into things you<br>can use so the good things so the<br>so our interest in the nutrifil is how<br>does it contribute to those disease<br>States so what does it do in the acute<br>inflammation and what does it do in the<br>chronic inflammation because it's<br>intimately involved in both one of the<br>things that neutrophils make in<br>abundance is this compound here now<br>everyone will recognize that as a very<br>common household antibacterial agent so<br>you use it to get rid of bacteria in<br>your house because it will kill most<br>things and and in the neutr the neutr<br>uses it because the nutrifil needs to<br>kill most bugs that it comes in contact<br>with so it's very good at doing that<br>what does that mean for disease well for<br>the pneumonia patient that's good news<br>because it will kill the the bacterium<br>um in the pneumonia in the arthritis<br>patient that's bad news and the reason<br>it's bad news is that he<br>in the arthritis patient the nutrifil is<br>directing its oxidants not at a bug but<br>at your knee or your back or any other<br>autoimmune and any other autoimmune<br>disease that's directing those oxidants<br>at you and therefore it's this is one of<br>the cause main causes of damage so this<br>has been this area of research has been<br>one of our major um interests for quite<br>a number of years and um we there's<br>still you know there's still a lot to<br>learn but we have learned a lot about<br>the production of janola by these cells<br>and so here's an example of some of the<br>work we're currently doing with this um<br>this is Stephanie bosan who's been<br>working at looking at how these oxidants<br>affect um the the walls of our blood<br>vessels so in the case of an of<br>atherosclerosis the the cells that line<br>the walls of our blood vessels is a<br>normal<br>um tissue here and you can see that<br>these cells here are um looking pretty<br>naked so we're looking at the way that<br>that these oxidants cause damage and<br>anything and that brings me<br>to the main topic of my talk which is<br>vitamin C and the role that it plays in<br>conjunction with all of these<br>mechanisms so it was because we were<br>interested nutrifil oxidants that we<br>started looking at vitamin C and because<br>it's an antioxidant and in the process<br>of doing that we have discovered that<br>there are a whole lot of other<br>activities of vitamin C that have impact<br>in a wi in almost every aspect of Our<br>Lives this has kind of dragged me off in<br>another research Direction but one that<br>um I think is very fruitful and very<br>important so everyone thinks they know<br>everything about vitamin<br>we all know we need it that's about as<br>much as actually all we know we know we<br>need it we're trying to figure out why<br>well vitamin C is the small molecule<br>it's made from<br>sugar and and it's<br>made by plants and in the livers of most<br>animals so most animals don't need to<br>eat anything with vitamin C in in it<br>people on the other hand and other<br>primat skinny pigs and some fruit bats<br>can't make their own vitamin C so<br>somewhere in our evolutionary history<br>we've lost that ability to do that<br>so so we must get it from our diet so<br>therefore for us it's a<br>vitamin<br>so our interest in in in the nutrifil<br>led us to think about okay here's a cell<br>that that makes a lot of um of oxidants<br>it<br>also if we look at where vitamin C is in<br>our bodies um we take it in from our<br>food it gets distributed around our body<br>and it gets taken up into our tissues at<br>various levels and the thought is that<br>the level that your body accumulates it<br>at is is indicative of how essential it<br>is to that organ for example it's really<br>high in the adrenals pituitary and<br>retina um it's also high in the brain<br>white blood cells pancreas liver lymph<br>and and and also it's relatively high<br>but the lowest body stores are in<br>sceletal and heart muscle so people have<br>you know ever since we've known about<br>vitamin C and they've looked at this<br>distribution think what is it doing in<br>all of these tissues and so we ask this<br>question um around white blood cells<br>which is the thing that we're interested<br>in and it's been a process<br>of discovery and theorizing and what I'm<br>going to do is just take you to our<br>findings um and they<br>center around the effect of vitamin C on<br>nutrifil function so these are the cells<br>that engulf and kill bacteria and if you<br>remember back to that that um x-ray of<br>the person with with pneumonia then this<br>is what's happening so this is a um a<br>microscope view of the lung so this is a<br>normal lung here which just got nice big<br>air space which is what you need when<br>you take a deep breath when you get an<br>infection so this is after 8 hours you<br>see that those air spaces getting filled<br>up well there what's filling those up<br>are these white cells the<br>neutrophils and after 2 days the air<br>space is full so that whiteness that you<br>saw on that x-ray is this it's full of<br>all these neutrophils now what we need<br>for recovery<br>of that<br>is these these we got to get rid of<br>these cells they might have killed off<br>the bacteria but we now have to get rid<br>of the nutrifil and how does that happen<br>in our body so we need to get back from<br>there to there in order to restore um<br>good lung function and we need to do it<br>in a way that doesn't destroy the lung<br>along the way now I said these cells are<br>really good at causing tissue injury and<br>they're really good at killing bacteria<br>and they are<br>loaded with proteases and enzymes that<br>can cause Havoc if they end up in your<br>body so we have this whole mechanism of<br>containment of the system and we need to<br>that needs to work in order to get from<br>here to here so what we need after the<br>inflammation is an effective cleanup and<br>it's in this aspect that we're<br>interested in vitamin C now normally<br>this is what happens to dying<br>neutrophils so at the end of that<br>infection when they they they undergo a<br>kind of a cell what we call a cell<br>suicide or<br>eposis and you see here in this cartoon<br>this is a normal<br>neutrophil and here it is on the way to<br>cell death and you can see it's kind of<br>wrinkly outside and all of these little<br>vesicles and you see these green signals<br>on the cell well these are sending out a<br>message to another cell called a<br>maccrage and they're saying to that<br>maccrage come eat me and so the maccrage<br>is the cleanup cell it comes into that<br>inflammatory site after the wave of<br>neutrophils and they clean<br>up and so here's a picture here of an<br>actual neutr and here you can see the<br>electron micrograph of it underway in<br>that process and you can see all of that<br>Bing now we've spent a bit of time<br>looking at this um and we've been able<br>to use one of our very cool new toys<br>which is a time lapse um<br>microscope and so I've been making some<br>movies of that process in action and um<br>hopefully this will play and and I can<br>show them to you now so what you see<br>here I'll use some Master Point these<br>this is a mixture of neutrophils these<br>are normal neutrophils and they all<br>contain vitamin C and they've just been<br>left in a dish and they're going to<br>undergo that cell death process and I'll<br>Point them out as they start to ruffle<br>and BB you'll see them this is this<br>short video covers a period of about 5<br>hours so you know it's it's<br>a time lapse<br>so we see it here here goes the first<br>one there I think this one's next<br>there there's another one down here that<br>there he goes see him<br>go there's another one<br>here I think that one or this one up<br>here is going to go<br>next that one's gone there he goes so<br>one at a<br>time it's one just coming into<br>frame there he is so you can see see<br>they're normally moving around they<br>undergo the cell<br>death and then they stop<br>moving so and and they do it you know<br>they're on a program towards doing this<br>and<br>those those cells at the end of that<br>process or during that process they're<br>supposed to be sending these signals to<br>um to the maccrage now with from this<br>from the same preparation<br>we've also got a preparation of macres<br>and so what I've done is I've taken<br>those dying nutrifil and I've added them<br>to this plate here and these cells that<br>you see here these are macras they're<br>all stuck on the<br>bottom I want you to concentrate on this<br>guy here he's amazing so I'm going to<br>show you what happens when we put these<br>dying neutrophils onto the cell and<br>remembering that diagram what you're<br>going to see is you're going to see the<br>cell eating the cells in the<br>vicinity and so there he goes you watch<br>him<br>go so you can you can see inside the<br>cell you can actually see the shape of<br>the cells it's taking up so they're<br>mostly kind of ghostly the dying cells<br>but he's hunting and um you know looking<br>for you know you'll you'll see them pick<br>up you know cells from this vicinity<br>here so and then he goes off and hunts<br>up in this direction for a<br>while and you can see how the cells um<br>around doing doing very similar things<br>so this process starts up as soon as we<br>add those dying neutrophils to to that<br>um to that<br>mixture they're<br>amazing I think I sat there for about 4<br>I don't know how many how many cells<br>they can eat but it looks like an awful<br>lot and so inside that they're turning<br>they're recycling all of that material<br>that that they're taking up this is<br>what's happening in your bodies um<br>basis<br>so so we wonder what what happens when<br>if you have a vitamin C deficient<br>nutrifil so if the cells don't have<br>vitamin C how does this affect that that<br>cell death process and and so these are<br>vitamin C deficient cells and they're at<br>the same age as those first ones you saw<br>that that are all um that bubble and and<br>and boil so to speak and so what you see<br>here if you watch this one<br>here these cells don't do that there's<br>an awful lot of activity inside that<br>cell but there's no bbing or bubbling<br>and in fact they<br>pop so and at the end of our at the end<br>of our time so you watch this one here<br>it's kind of halfway through this<br>process they start instead of shrinking<br>up they start to swell up and then they<br>cells and at the end of the process<br>we've got a whole lot of these cells<br>that look dead but so what happens to<br>them if you if you put them um with the<br>macrofagos what would happen to them and<br>so here we have another lot of macres<br>and these are so here we are up close<br>and so if you concentrate in this area<br>here there's two candidates that look<br>very similar to our previous one and<br>you'll see that we've added so I've<br>added those dying vitamin C deficient<br>neutrophils to these and you can see<br>that these cells they're definitely<br>alive they're sitting there but there's<br>no activity with respect to recognizing<br>those dead and dying vitamin C deficient<br>nutrifil so these cells are blind to to<br>that signal and what that<br>means for people is that we<br>need we need good vitamin C when we're<br>sick we need good vitamin C for our<br>immune cells in order for that clean up<br>to happen in in a in a controlled way<br>and as we were thinking about this and<br>here's a summary of of um this part of<br>the talk um we were thinking so vitamin<br>C is required for Effective nutrifil<br>removal and clean up and and actually<br>what would happen if this went wrong and<br>so we thought do we have any clinical<br>evidence that that would be devastating<br>because someone asked me a question in<br>one of our research groups once and they<br>said what would happen and I saidou<br>would dissolve from the inside and then<br>we thought what happens to people with<br>scurvy and actually you know here's<br>here's an example of someone with scurvy<br>your tissues break down from the inside<br>so you know we think it's very possible<br>that one of the major contribut to this<br>kind of damage is the fact that your<br>neutrophils are bursting and releasing<br>those enzymes into your tissues in a way<br>that's actually<br>devastating and as a result of that you<br>know people with scurvy<br>die sudden and horrible<br>deaths so I was in thinking about this<br>and this this um aspect of of our work<br>that we thought well this is true in<br>nutrifil which have um vitamin C but<br>what how's the vitamin C doing this<br>what's the mechanism um um behind this<br>and we started looking at other other<br>kinds of neutrophil functions and one of<br>the papers that came out around the time<br>that we were thinking about this was<br>showed us that um that a lack of oxygen<br>so if neutrophils are active and a lack<br>of oxygen they have plenty of vitamin C<br>they behave almost identically to our<br>neutrophils that have no vitamin C even<br>though ours have got plenty of oxygen<br>and so we started thinking you know<br>what's the link here because what the<br>cells are doing is exactly the same<br>thing and are these two things linked in<br>some<br>way sorry I need to go back to that cuz<br>this is OSHA pujari who's who's a PhD<br>student she's now studying um the effect<br>of hypoxia or low oxygen on um nutrifil<br>function turning out some very nice data<br>too now the<br>link taking you back then to we look at<br>proteins inside cells the link is a<br>protein called hiff one hypoxia<br>inducible factor or hiff and this<br>protein controls the cells response to<br>low oxygen under normal conditions so<br>every cell in your body has it and it's<br>a stress response protein that that that<br>will react in in the absence of oxygen<br>so and it does that in in this way so<br>the protein's made up of two two<br>components Alpha and beta and the alpha<br>component gets Modified by these enzymes<br>called pral hydroxylases and others a<br>few others and these enzymes stick these<br>hydroxy groups on that protein and that<br>means it gets destroyed so this is an<br>off<br>switch um and these enzymes need oxygen<br>and vitamin C so this is the link this<br>this is the link between vitamin C and<br>um the white blood cell um function so<br>if if if oxygen or vitamin C is missing<br>then what you have is this protein is<br>stabilized so it stays in the cell and<br>it is able to pair up um with it sister<br>protein and that upregulates a whole lot<br>of Gene responses that means that cells<br>can overcome the stress of low oxygen<br>so no no escate or no oxygen will do the<br>same<br>thing and when we were looking at HFF<br>one we just we realized that not only is<br>it likely to have an effect in our white<br>cells because one of the things that it<br>regulates is how cells grow and die and<br>we see an effect on how those white<br>cells die but but it's responsible for a<br>whole raft of other responses in the<br>cell including a whole lot of things<br>that we know to be common to cancer and<br>and and many other stress responses so<br>so a lack of oxygen for example will<br>mean that that the cell switches its<br>energy Pathways to get its to get its<br>energy in a in a non oxygen oxygen<br>dependent way or that it stimulates the<br>formation of new blood vessels to bring<br>new oxygen to the to the region that's<br>lacking<br>and so we started thinking about he one<br>not just in terms of the white blood<br>cell but in terms of all our cells and<br>what it might be doing<br>there and so we're going to leave the<br>first room in my virtual house and we're<br>going to the second<br>room which I share with these<br>people um so these this is Gabby Dax and<br>and Margaret Curry and Helen Moren from<br>the McKenzie cancer research<br>um group and this is Caroline Cooper and<br>Lizzie Campbell who are two PhD students<br>who are working on on on our topics and<br>in this<br>room we find people with<br>cancer and so it was our realization<br>that hiff one is really important to<br>cancer that made us consider well if<br>vitamin<br>C's involved in regulating he1 maybe it<br>has something to do with regulating<br>cancer growth as<br>well and at this point you have to take<br>a brave step because this is an area of<br>huge<br>controversy and we've I've stayed with<br>this idea because actually I think it's<br>a good idea and there's something to it<br>but<br>within probably in in the last well<br>since the<br>1980s there's been two polarized groups<br>fighting about whether or not can<br>vitamin C has anything to do with cancer<br>or not and earlier and it all started<br>really with this man here lonus Pauling<br>who in who was the most amazing<br>scientist and active individual as well<br>one of only two people to be<br>individually sharing the Nobel Prize in<br>different areas so he and Marie cury are<br>the only two people um to have achieved<br>this and lonus Pauling received the<br>Nobel Prize in 1954 for uncovering how<br>proteins maintain their<br>shape um so the kind of forces that that<br>are involved in giving proteins their<br>shape and in<br>1962 he got the Nobel Peace Prize for<br>his anti-war um efforts in in the United<br>States and it was shortly after this<br>actually it was in the 1970s that he<br>started<br>working um with the Dr Cameron in<br>Scotland who was giving his patients<br>intravenous vitamin C giving his cancer<br>patients intravenous vitamin C and<br>claiming that that these people were see<br>were seeing wonderful benefits well at<br>the time there was no mechanism to<br>explain why that would possibly be a<br>good idea and he got blasted pretty much<br>by everybody for even suggesting that it<br>was possible now he wasn't a medic and<br>he waited into this area of research<br>really without any you know kind of guns<br>blazing without any um<br>fear um as you would have you wouldn't<br>have if you had two Nobel prizes um that<br>any fear of criticism but also there was<br>never in all of the efforts that he made<br>there was never a mechanism to explain<br>why this might be a good idea and so we<br>were thinking about this and thought you<br>know actually maybe lonus poing was onto<br>something and maybe it needs a further<br>look so let's have a look at the hiff<br>one and so<br>in this is and and our hypothesis is<br>based on the fact that hiff one is a<br>major driver of tumor growth so and the<br>reason it does this is because as a<br>solid tumor starts to form in your body<br>the minute it gets Beyond one or two<br>millim big it needs a blood supply or<br>else those cells have no oxygen because<br>oxygen won't diffuse further than that<br>and so what happens is that the center<br>of a of that tumor gets hypoxic so as it<br>runs out of oxygen it turns on hi one in<br>the center and once it does that it<br>starts to generate new blood vessels<br>that feed the tumor and that that the<br>ability to do that allows the tumor to<br>grow bigger and bigger and this this is<br>what we call the tumor micro environment<br>so it's this stress on these cells in<br>the center that allows that tumor to<br>grow bigger if we didn't have this we<br>probably wouldn't have solid tumors they<br>actually would be unable to grow um<br>without it so knowing that vitamin C's<br>involved in regulating hiff we thought<br>is there any link<br>between vitamin C in the tumor and the<br>amount of hiff activation um that we see<br>because as you can imagine vitamin C's<br>got to get delivered in here as well and<br>so in the absence of blood vessels in<br>this Center then you're going to get<br>more hiff upregulated if you have no<br>oxygen and no vitamin C so if you have<br>one or the other you'll you'll moderate<br>that effect so we're not looking for<br>an all or none what we're looking for is<br>let's shift that that gradient so that<br>we're damping down this response and<br>what effect does that have does that<br>have any effect on the tumor growth<br>because that might explain why people<br>sometimes do better when they're seeing<br>um when they're upping their vitamin C<br>intake and so I was very lucky at that<br>time that Caroline Cooper walked through<br>the door and said I want to do a PhD<br>project in cancer and I said I've got<br>the perfect project for you and Caroline<br>has carried out an extremely difficult<br>um PhD and made a wonderful job of it<br>she's a fantastic student or she was<br>she's now a<br>postdoc um and what we did was we made<br>use of a resource that's in this<br>building it's the Cancer Society tissue<br>bank and so over the years people have<br>donated their tissues their tumor<br>tissues when they've been removed by<br>surgery and they've been banked here and<br>so we have an amazing resource that's<br>tumor tissue and normal tissue from the<br>same patient and so we thought let's<br>analyze those tissues because we can<br>measure what's going on in in those<br>tumors and let's see if what we can<br>measure so this is Caroline grinding up<br>a tiny piece of tumor which you can see<br>a vague pink here um under under liquid<br>nitrogen so we keep everything cold to<br>keep it stable and she is measured in in<br>in this in this tumor the cells the hiff<br>one proteins that it that it generates<br>um and also vitamin C so we've measured<br>all of the things together in a patient<br>in their normal tissue and in the tumor<br>tissue to see is there any difference<br>are there any differences there well<br>wouldn't be telling you this if there<br>weren't um<br>so what we found was that in high-grade<br>tumors so those are tumors that have a<br>poor blood supply or disorganized blood<br>supply that the amount of vitamin C is<br>much lower than it is in low grade<br>tumors so these these tumors have more<br>difficulty getting hold of the vitamin C<br>that they have but when we look at the<br>absolute amount and that's dependent not<br>only on the type of tumor but also on<br>how much vitam and see that person might<br>be taking in or what their AB normal<br>plasma levels are then then what we see<br>is the amount of vitamin C in in the<br>tumor affects the amount of hiff one<br>that's activated in in that tumor so so<br>tumors that had higher a scoreback<br>Content had much damp down levels of<br>that H one protein we would expect that<br>that would would have a positive benefit<br>on on on tumor growth so it would slow<br>down tumor growth and tumors that had<br>lower the lower half they had much<br>higher<br>activation now because these many of<br>these samples have been banked some of<br>them for up to 10 years we were able to<br>do a retrospective analysis on the<br>tissues that we analyzed to see how<br>those patients had done post surgery and<br>so this is a result from a coloral<br>cancer study um so at this point here um<br>the the tumor was removed surgically and<br>so the patient been follow up followed<br>up um Al um along that time and what you<br>can see here is those those tumors that<br>had higher levels of vitamin C at this<br>point those patients did better with a<br>much lesser um number of patients<br>presenting with with um secondary um<br>cancers or progressing on than than the<br>tumors that that had low Vitamin C now<br>this is the first time that anyone's<br>been able to do this analysis and it's<br>it's a fortunate Coincidence of<br>expertise and and um dedication so we<br>have dedicated people who have acquired<br>this tissue and also that combines with<br>our expertise being able to measure<br>something in the tissue so measurement<br>is good so this change nothing to do<br>with Stage or grade of the tumor was<br>only dependent on how much vitamin C was<br>in there so we haven't manipulated this<br>at all but it's a good indication that<br>what we might want to do is a clinical<br>trial where we actually do an<br>intervention so we can see if you give a<br>patient more is that likely to benefit<br>work um and so so that's our hypothesis<br>that if we can have an impact on this<br>region here damp down that response then<br>that's going to slow the rate of tumor<br>growth and it would also help the rate<br>of chemotherapy so you know vitamin C<br>could be a useful adjunct to the current<br>therapies that that we<br>have so now I'm going to take you into<br>my third<br>room because it wasn't just it's not<br>just about cancer it's about these this<br>these proteins being present in all our<br>cells all the time and we know we need<br>Vitamin C on a daily basis so we're<br>thinking you know that might be really<br>important in cancer but how does this<br>how does these mechanisms impact on our<br>general stress responses and so in this<br>room with me the Steph bosan electrica<br>and Juliet POA<br>and I'm really fortunate to be able to<br>work with with these three because<br>they're a phenomenal<br>team and so in this room in my virtual<br>house there's a lot of people and in<br>fact everybody is in this room so<br>everybody in this room is in this room<br>because these this issue actually<br>affects our daytoday health and<br>well-being and I'm going to show you how<br>we um are trying to contend with um some<br>of those things things and so those hiff<br>those enzymes that regulate hiff that I<br>told you about they're one of a family<br>well they're part of a family and this<br>this family of enzymes is present in all<br>our cells doing a multitude of jobs they<br>all have the same properties they need<br>oxygen they need Vitamin C to work some<br>of them downregulate things some of them<br>up regulate things and new functions are<br>being discovered for them um almost<br>daily<br>um so they were first known to um uh<br>help make collagen so to to make the<br>modifications that that um allow good<br>strong collagen cross linking in our<br>tissues so people tell you vitamin C is<br>good for your skin they are also known<br>to um be involved in the rate of hormone<br>synthesis in the brain and the adrenals<br>these are the hiff enzymes that um that<br>actually control um metabolic responses<br>so good supply of oxygen not just in<br>tumors but but in in all our tissues<br>they've recently been shown to be<br>involved in epigenetics which is the<br>control of the way our cells the kind of<br>genes that are read um in in our cells<br>um over and above your genetic<br>inheritance and they're also involved in<br>cell stress um signaling responses so if<br>we look at that Myriad of of functions<br>then you can see that the kinds of<br>effects that might have on on us is that<br>vitamin C can be beneficial for wound<br>healing and tissue formation can be<br>involved in mood and energy is um uh<br>important in cancer the immune system<br>and one of the enzymes that controls or<br>the situations of metabolism is like<br>epetite control um in the epigenetics<br>they can regulate Gene function which<br>can pretty much affect everything um and<br>also our general stress responses to<br>environmental<br>stresses so we get pretty excited at<br>this point and think my God you know<br>this is fundamental to our health when<br>we think about animals generally they<br>make their own vitamin C and they<br>control their levels absolutely<br>meticulously so so an animal that's<br>making its own vitamin will maintain<br>that level no matter what and but we<br>don't we we need to eat it and so this<br>is where you know in our Modern World um<br>we might be going a miss and here so<br>this is often a question that people ask<br>how much vitamin C do we need and this<br>has been argued about since um 1932 when<br>this was discovered as the cause for<br>scurvy because the level that was<br>recommended Ed was the level that you<br>need in order not to get scurvy so it<br>was thought we don't want people to be<br>having too much let's just give them<br>enough you know we just need to stop<br>people having scurvy because that's what<br>vitamin c does well the RDA or as it's<br>set this is this is a graph that shows<br>you the the amount of vitamin C in your<br>blood and this is where all of your<br>tissues get it from and so the more<br>vitamin C you take in<br>the higher it goes in your blood and<br>you'll see you know you need to be up<br>here in order to be for for your blood<br>levels to be saturated but our<br>RDA is way down here so it's at 45<br>milligrams per day this is what we are<br>advised this is what you need in order<br>to um survive and and and to be healthy<br>these are healthy levels<br>well Mark Lavine who who did this work<br>points out that you know if you look at<br>this curve here it's a really steep part<br>of the curve if you alter your intake<br>even slightly to either side of that you<br>you could end up down here or up here<br>and so at this level it's going to be<br>huge variation in terms of how much you<br>you take up and what he recommends is<br>that actually you know 500 Mig a day 200<br>mg a day will get you up here and that's<br>much more like um a healthy level and<br>interestingly those are the levels at<br>which you see prevention of chronic<br>diseases so when people are taking in<br>you know 400 milligrams a day that has<br>an effect on longevity cancer um heart<br>disease a whole number of um big Studies<br>have have shown that that that kind of<br>intake um has has good health<br>preventative um<br>measures and<br>so it's not only when you're well so I<br>said animals will maintain their levels<br>no matter what because their body's<br>responding to um to the the the<br>different environmental challenges and<br>so one of the things we're getting<br>interested in is you can see here there<br>are white bars and black bars now the<br>white bars are a healthy population this<br>is blood vitamin C levels and this is<br>the percent um of people and so if you<br>look at the white bars first here<br>deficiency levels are anything below<br>about 28 micro molar so anything down<br>from here so even the healthy population<br>there's quite a few people who um don't<br>have a lot of circulating vitamin C now<br>they won't have scurvy symptoms but how<br>healthy are they likely to be and<br>actually the peak of normal people round<br>about 50 which also isn't that<br>saturation level so it's not as much as<br>your body can take on<br>board when you look at a population of<br>Hospital hospital patients so these are<br>people on admission to hospital these<br>are sick people their vitamin C levels<br>are low really low this is the Canadian<br>study and most of them are down in the<br>deficiency level now I don't know if any<br>of you have spent time in the wards in<br>the hospital but you've be pushing it to<br>get your your daily vitamin C intake<br>from a hospital diet<br>um and and I think it's probably why we<br>bring fruit to hospital patients so they<br>should probably eat that um but but this<br>is interesting because because animals<br>when they're sick um will increase their<br>level of synthesis so a goat apparently<br>when it's sick will make 70 grams a day<br>of vitamin C in order to maintain its<br>blood at those levels now people have<br>taken very little notice of this and<br>it's very hardly ever measured as as a<br>measure of of patient well-being but I<br>guess what what we're saying is you know<br>and and these people um also in Canada<br>are saying is we need to look at this<br>because if you supplement these patients<br>you see a benefit um in terms of outcome<br>and and<br>mood so there's some interesting work um<br>that that's appearing so just but but<br>for you and I on our day-to-day basis we<br>want to get that 200 migr of vitamin C<br>from our diet um then how are we going<br>to do that and one of our our aims is is<br>to look at how we're going to get this<br>public health message out there that one<br>the RDI should be increased but secondly<br>you know what kind of dietary advice do<br>we give people and currently the kind of<br>healthy eating is you know five plus a<br>day for fruit and vegetables without any<br>advice as to what fruit are better than<br>what not all fruit and vegetables are<br>equal when it comes to vitamin C in fact<br>absolutely not so you can see here and<br>I've got here you know one of our main<br>exports kiwi fruit green and gold you<br>know there's a few things that have been<br>listed as exceptional and this is an<br>international website and kiwi fruits up<br>there with with two of them capsicum is<br>also really good um and then as you go<br>further down the list you'll see you<br>know you we got you know broccolis<br>coming in first in the<br>vegetables um but if you were to per<br>serving if you were to want to get 200<br>mg per day day then and you're picking<br>your five plus a day out of here if<br>you're eating from down here your five<br>plus you're not going to be taking in<br>that much vitamin C and so you know one<br>of the messages we give you is that well<br>that's all well and good but one of<br>those things should be something from<br>the top of the list because you want to<br>increase um your uptake then you need to<br>be eating you know right across the<br>range cabbage is very<br>good um so we did a study in conjunction<br>um with zes because they're interested<br>because kiwi fruits scores so well on on<br>that graph well we've recruited um some<br>University students who anecdotally eat<br>really badly turns out not many of them<br>eat that badly but it's not that hard to<br>find people who who um have very low<br>vitamin C and so just to see what impact<br>that has so what you eat how does that<br>impact on on your vitamin C up um intake<br>so this is number of serves of fruit and<br>vegetables that these guys had and so<br>you can see when they came in they<br>having around about four four S and most<br>people would say that's not bad um and<br>and then we've supplemented them with<br>either half a kiwi fruit one two or<br>three kiwi fruit by the time they're<br>eating two and three kiwi fruit their<br>number of serves of fruit and vegetables<br>has gone up so that that the Kiwi fruits<br>having an impact on their total intake<br>but when we compare that graph with the<br>amount of vitamin C they're getting from<br>their food so their initial intake has<br>got them right here at the RDI level of<br>50 Mig just under 50 Mig Health<br>Department would say that's fine you're<br>doing great um when when they add Ki<br>fruit half a Ki fruit makes a difference<br>to that one 2 three kiwi fruit gets them<br>up to 300 Mig a day so two kood is<br>adding a high value food like that so if<br>you were to have an orange or you know<br>some something from the top of the list<br>um that's going to boost your intake um<br>if you want to stay with five plus a<br>day when we looked in the blood of these<br>young men you see that that um that 45<br>mg that they started with that doesn't<br>do their plasma vitamin C much good so<br>actually they're you know just above the<br>or round about the early deficiency<br>level um when we give them the kiwi<br>fruit within a week to kiwi fruit<br>they're up to saturating levels so<br>they've been able the body's been able<br>to take that up and it responds<br>immediately to your uptake so vitamin C<br>is water soluble and so easily taken up<br>at the end of the<br>intervention um we take them they stop<br>eating the kiwi fruit look what happens<br>you know back to their old habit<br>and within within a few weeks their<br>bodies deplete again so the message is<br>daily not just once a month once a month<br>won't<br>help um and this is their tissue levels<br>so not only is it in their blood but it<br>also makes a difference to your tissue<br>so this is their muscle um vitamin C<br>levels and you can see that the higher<br>there the higher their their their blood<br>vitamin C goes the higher um uh their<br>muscle levels are and that will be<br>reflective of all their other tissues as<br>well so you know if you're surviving<br>down here at the 20 then you know all of<br>your tissues are going to be depleted<br>which is something that we hadn't<br>thought would happen we thought the<br>tissues would you know take it up much<br>more readily and hold on to it for<br>longer but no they don't so you know<br>animals make this on a daily basis and<br>we probably need to eat it on a daily<br>basis and so we've looked at as part of<br>that study and one of the interesting<br>things that came out of it was that we<br>did a mood questionnaire on these young<br>men before and after eating the kiwi<br>fruit now they weren't depressed um but<br>but when we when we analyze the um score<br>so they're not clinically depressed when<br>we analyze their scores you can see that<br>after the kiwi fruit there's a<br>significant decrease in what we call the<br>total mood disturbance score and that<br>that number is made up of of a number of<br>different measures and where where that<br>difference is this is a combined measure<br>of all of these things where that<br>difference has come about is that the<br>vitamin C um in Intervention when we<br>believe that's what the kiwi fruit is<br>contributing is a drop in the rate of<br>depression in these young men and a<br>decrease in fatigue so they felt like<br>they had more energy and an increase in<br>Vigor so which is um another measure so<br>these are measures of<br>well-being um and this is really<br>interesting because this population<br>would be representative of you know you<br>and I and um people who think you know<br>you think you're well but actually you<br>Weller um and so this is Mark Lavine<br>again and and his message is is the same<br>is that you know if you look looking at<br>Vitamin C in the plasma then you want to<br>if you know at these kind of levels<br>you're going to get you're going to<br>rapidly rising at 100% protection from<br>getting scurvy but if you want to see<br>other health benefits then then that's a<br>much slower Improvement and it's really<br>not until you get to these saturating<br>levels in your plasma so where where<br>your blood's got as much as as your body<br>wants it to have have that you're going<br>to see the maximum health benefit so in<br>well-being so I'm going to end our story<br>there um and tell you that we we're<br>still going and we're emerging with our<br>dreams intact so there are still things<br>we want to do we want to continue to<br>look at how Vitamin C supports immune<br>cell function and um we have some<br>studies underway for that we want to do<br>a proper informed clinical study with<br>vitamin C and cancer and I think you<br>know people are screaming for this to be<br>done and we would love to be able to do<br>it and fingers crossed we may be getting<br>closer um to that um we would also like<br>to be able to influence the RDI level<br>within New Zealand and Australia so it's<br>an australasian measure in the US in<br>fact Anitra was instrumental in having<br>the US level doubled um up to 100<br>milligrams and we would like to see the<br>New Zealand Health System take a similar<br>message that actually we need to be<br>telling people that you know what what<br>they think is enough is actually not<br>enough and so it remains for me to thank<br>people um you some many of you will know<br>but we survive on um grant funding and<br>so that pays our salaries and working<br>expenses as well as the support that<br>that we get from the University and so<br>applying for funding is a major um part<br>of our activities and we're very<br>grateful to all these funding bodies um<br>for supporting us um over over the years<br>so um I think I'm very fortunate um to<br>have been able to do science in a period<br>when I started that funding<br>was ample compared with today we didn't<br>think so at the time but we didn't spend<br>90% of our time applying for money<br>whereas now you know many people spend<br>far too much time applying for money and<br>not being allowed to um get on get on<br>with doing um that's something that we<br>continue to to try to influence but I<br>thought<br>can't let him you know we can't give a<br>talk and not say that things in this<br>country are difficult um at best for<br>people um doing um biomedical research<br>or medical research generally so we've<br>managed to get some money from the<br>ministry the MBI um zisy has been a<br>wonderful organization to work with and<br>they're very real and and also they<br>understand science as well um the cmrf<br>which is a local funding organization<br>very important um Organization for for<br>keeping us going um at times when we<br>otherwise would have faltered the<br>lottery grants board um Pro you know uh<br>provid some funding for materials and um<br>equipment um and Tec which I'll mention<br>it doesn't do this anymore but it<br>supported Caroline's post Caroline's PhD<br>scholarship and it's it's a shame that<br>they stopped doing that because you know<br>we never had funding for that cancer<br>study and if it hadn't been for the fact<br>that she'd walked in to do it you know<br>we would have struggled um to do that so<br>it was wonderful to have a fantastic<br>student who was able to be supported to<br>do that<br>work so I have two thank yous to make<br>one well that was the first one of three<br>one is the second one is thank you to<br>the Center for free radical search um<br>this is our current grouping I think<br>we've had I don't know how many group<br>photos we've had with um umen people but<br>we have a group as you can see of<br>wonderful young students and postdocs<br>who come in to work with us and to keep<br>us vibrant and interested and I'd like<br>to say that you know I feel really<br>fortunate to have been worked through<br>the time that I did when my education<br>was free my PhD study was subsidized and<br>I was able to establish myself in a<br>research career at a time when funding<br>was relatively abundant compared with<br>today these students have equal<br>passion but much less opportunity it is<br>much harder for them and I'm full of<br>admiration to them for choosing science<br>as a pathway and also for for Having the<br>courage to to stay there with it many of<br>them go on we lose most of them overseas<br>when they finished their phds they do<br>very well in overseas Laboratories<br>because they're very good we need to<br>keep some of them in New Zealand and so<br>let's hope that we can make some um<br>progress in that area and the last thank<br>you is to my other<br>team um and my other support crew and<br>they're nearly all here Maria's in<br>London um so she'll be watching online<br>sometime in the<br>future uh so without without without<br>this slot I wouldn't be standing here<br>today and they continue to be um my my<br>inspiration and drive and they pick me<br>up every time I come home and say I<br>don't know if I can do this anymore it's<br>all too hard so I get the word put on me<br>from these three you need to inspire us<br>because they've chosen very difficult<br>careers as well so my husband's an<br>artist and they've all inherited the art<br>Gene and so it came through me but not<br>from me um Olivia is an artist Heather's<br>a musician and Maria's an actor<br>and I'm grateful to have young people<br>like this in my life who are willing to<br>embrace that challenge and say this is<br>our talent we value what we can do well<br>and we want to contribute to the world<br>with it and so with the young people in<br>our group so I want to dedicate this to<br>the young people in our group and to<br>these young people who who are prepared<br>to take a chance on their lives and so I<br>want to finish with just one word from a<br>card that Olivia just gave me before I<br>came in<br>here and she says hoay for science art<br>music<br>knowledge and um I'd like to finish with<br>that amen I say</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
