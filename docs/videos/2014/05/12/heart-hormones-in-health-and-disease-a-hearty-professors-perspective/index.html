Lecture.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name's Peter Joyce I'm dean of the<br>University of otago Christchurch and<br>it's my pleasure tonight<br>to introduce the first of seven public<br>lectures uh all of which will be<br>inaugural professorial lectures over<br>these next seven Wednesdays<br>for those who have come to these before<br>we're running them an hour earlier at<br>six rather than seven and we're<br>interested in feedback as to what is the<br>tonight's first lecture is deliberately<br>chosen to be on a heart topic because<br>it's also heart week and there have been<br>there are pamphlets out in the foia from<br>heart foundation for those who wish to<br>take those and some will know there have<br>been events on uh lat Monday and last<br>evening and tomorrow evening are all<br>around the theme of Hearts disease<br>but tonight it's my pleasure to<br>introduce Professor Chris Childs now<br>Chris completed a master of science at<br>the University of Canterbury he did his<br>PhD here and has been on staff since<br>1989.<br>he was promoted to Professor in February<br>2013 and this is his inaugural<br>professorial address and it will be on<br>the topic of heart hormones thank you<br>well thank you all for coming<br>um as Peter said it's heart week and<br>it's great to be able to talk about<br>heart hormones and health and disease<br>and give you a hearty professor's<br>perspective<br>um<br>I as Peter said I'm from Christchurch<br>Heart Institute which is uh fully part<br>of the University of otago Christchurch<br>here a group of about 40 researchers who<br>study anything and everything about<br>hearts and so<br>just to give you a synopsis on on what<br>I'm going to speak about over the next<br>45 minutes or so I'm going to give you<br>not necessarily in this order but some<br>is mixed and matched<br>a talk about my journey from the mid 80s<br>onward<br>that talk about the Christchurch Heart<br>Institute story which follows actually<br>started before 1988 when I started with<br>the group but I've been an integral part<br>of that for the full 25 years I've been<br>working here I'm going to talk about the<br>problems and the um the problem that is<br>heart disease and the questions that we<br>have asked about that and by way of some<br>of the answers I'm going to talk about<br>the science mostly I hope that I will be<br>showing you simple science that is easy<br>for you to understand<br>and then in small writing some will be<br>complex but those slides will be in<br>passing so you won't need to read or<br>necessarily understand all of that but<br>it helps make the picture a little more<br>complete<br>so my story starts as Peter said during<br>the 80s early 80s I was at University<br>for six years doing two degrees and<br>um by the end of 1986 I consider myself<br>a scientist in training<br>my second degree which was a masters<br>involved one year of research but it's<br>not really real work at that stage<br>so there I was I was called a master of<br>science I don't think that that meant at<br>all that I'd mastered science but more<br>that I was a toddler just out of nappies<br>a young boy a master<br>uh what I what I was introduced to in my<br>time at Lincoln was hormones at that<br>time I was interested in in the effect<br>of insulin and Lambs or sheep<br>and that will become obvious as to why<br>that's relevant for<br>um what I'm going to talk about the rest<br>of my career<br>the context in my time at Lincoln was on<br>the hind limb muscle<br>or as you may recognize it<br>the Sunday roast of lamb so what we were<br>doing as an agricultural College was how<br>do we make your leg of lamb more lean<br>and less fat<br>to be to give a talk on a hearty<br>Professor though I need to get rid of<br>the leg of lamb and talk about the heart<br>so the heart is an amazing organ it's<br>it's a it's a muscular pump that just<br>keeps going and going and going until<br>the day we die<br>but at the same time during the 80s when<br>I was learning about sheep and hormones<br>and things there were first of all why<br>why sorry why is the heart so important<br>well 16 new zealanders die every day of<br>a heart attack or heart disease<br>and tomorrow it could be you or someone<br>you love or indeed me<br>at the Heart Institute we save lives<br>every day through the development of<br>improved diagnostic tests prediction and<br>treatment of serious cardiovascular<br>disease<br>From the Bench the laboratory to the<br>bedside alongside patients the doctors<br>and into the community as well<br>and this really summarizes the problem<br>that we study this data is 14 years old<br>now but is still quite similar today<br>even though it's changed slightly<br>40 percent of all people who die in New<br>Zealand die of a cardiovascular disease<br>22 percent of coronary heart disease<br>eight percent of other heart disease and<br>cerebral vascular which include stroke<br>and the like<br>that's similar in 1990 it was higher<br>than all cancers put together<br>actually now those numbers have more or<br>less equalized but it's a major killer<br>of each and every New Zealander well not<br>ever in New Zealand but of a large<br>proportion of new zealanders<br>the world was starting to discover that<br>the heart was not just a mechanical pump<br>and this is work that um was Revolution<br>really revolutionary in the study of our<br>knowledge of hats was done by a South<br>American<br>Research working in Canada called de<br>bold up here is an electron micrograph a<br>a very blown up picture of the atrium of<br>a heart this is the nucleus the the<br>control center of the cell this is the<br>muscular fibers that make the heart<br>contract but in here the granular tissue<br>and this look this looks like other<br>endocrine organs so it was suspected by<br>De bold actually this was known for<br>about two or three decades before this<br>but it was suspected that this may<br>contain hormonal type substances what<br>the Bold did was he ground up<br>in a very crude fashion the Atria from<br>some Rats the atrium of the heart from<br>some rats and he injected it into other<br>rats and what he saw when he injected<br>the atrial heart tissue into other rats<br>was that there was a fallen blood<br>pressure<br>there was a rise in hematocrit which is<br>the percentage of red blood cells in in<br>the blood and this is there was a<br>dramatic increase in both the urinary<br>flow the amount of urine produced by the<br>rats and the urine sodium amount of salt<br>coming out in the<br>urine<br>so the heart was now to be considered as<br>like most hormones most hormones travel<br>in our blood and can be measured in our<br>blood so scientists around the world in<br>the 80s including here in Christchurch<br>started asking the question does ANP<br>this factor that de bold had found and<br>described in 1981 atrial nitritic<br>peptide does it circulate in our blood<br>at measurable levels and are the plasma<br>levels raised in cardiovascular disease<br>disorders<br>so<br>what you need to do is take a blood<br>sample give it to a very clever looking<br>biochemist type scientist<br>and get him to measure it and tell you<br>whether firstly he can see whether it's<br>there in the blood and also whether it<br>is raised when the heart is under stress<br>the short answer to this question is<br>that yes<br>A and P the hormone sourced from the<br>heart is in the plasma and it is<br>measured at a concentration of 10<br>picomoles per liter I thought most of<br>you wouldn't know what 10 Peak moles per<br>liter was so so I did some crude<br>calculations<br>10 pic moles per liter of A and P that<br>is circulating probably in most of our<br>blood systems at the moment is the<br>equivalent of 30 nanograms per liter<br>or 5 grams and 1.7 times 10 for the<br>put that in perspective that's like<br>having a teaspoon of salt in 68 olympic<br>size swimming pools<br>and that is what our clever scientists<br>have to be able to measure<br>is the water in the 68 swimming pools<br>fresh or does it have a teaspoon of salt<br>spread throughout it<br>so for that you need very clever tests<br>this is one of the slides that you don't<br>need to understand everything but it's<br>just here for completeness so I'm not<br>going to read everything but the way<br>that we measure things like A and P is<br>by radium you know assay it involves<br>putting the known<br>compound into a test tube<br>putting radioactive labeled compound of<br>the same in<br>separating that out over hours or days<br>with antibodies and then drawing a curve<br>like this which gives you a way by which<br>you can measure very low levels of the<br>hormones in this instance<br>so during the mid 80s and ongoing a<br>world-class Christchurch lab was<br>developing essays for amp and other<br>vasoactive hormones<br>so here we have our lookalike to the<br>scientist<br>Professor Tim Yandel who is there in the<br>audience<br>uh Eric Espana who is an endocrinologist<br>endocrinologist who was in charge over<br>all of the lab at the time and Steve<br>Fisher who who was our head technologist<br>so March 1988 was when I first came on<br>the scene so Chris Charles this young<br>looking chap here actually the photo<br>taken about uh six months beforehand was<br>employed as a research technician in the<br>lab and I was employed to do uh to<br>measure amp and blood samples<br>my first introduction to what is now<br>I just want to take away a side now<br>because this is not only my story but<br>this is actually group of work of The<br>Wider group that they have done over the<br>next 10 to 15 years<br>so actually for 25 years plus<br>of naturotic peptide assays measuring<br>this hormone in the blood Christchurch<br>has led the world<br>it was later discovered a few years<br>later that Not only was there ANP a<br>polypeptide of 28 amino acids like a<br>small protein but it had two other<br>related cousins which are produced by<br>our body as well amp and BNP<br>I just want to concentrate a little more<br>on BNP because over the coming years<br>that was what gained a little more<br>traction in both the scientific and the<br>clinical world<br>so this is just a scheme of of how BNP<br>is produced in our bodies<br>when the gene is first translated into a<br>p into a peptide into a protein<br>it comes out as actually 134 different<br>amino acids stuck together<br>very quickly probably in after it is<br>produced in the cell the signal peptide<br>is cleaved off and you end up with Pro<br>BNP now 108 amino acids and from that<br>there's a separation to what is called<br>the amino terminal probe BNP and what<br>actually circulates in our blood or one<br>part of what circulates in our blood at<br>least anyway the active portion of the<br>peptide BM BNP or brain naturally<br>cryptide<br>what our group uh<br>asked was<br>other in other Nitric peptides could<br>they be useful as biomarkers<br>a biomarker is a protein or other<br>measured in blood or it could be urine<br>or something whose concentration<br>reflects the presence or severity of<br>some disease States and this can be used<br>to diagnose diseases can be used to look<br>at disease risk stratification across<br>population individuals prognosis how<br>well you will do once you are diagnosed<br>and also potentially to tailor<br>treatments how should we treat a<br>particular patient<br>very early in the 1990s<br>it was Eric Espana I think actually who<br>asked the question from our group can<br>circulating BNP act as a cardiac<br>biomarker<br>Mark Davis was a a young medical student<br>at the time and did a summer studentship<br>collecting patients from emergency<br>department he collected samples from 52<br>patients presenting to emergency<br>department with acute dyspnea or<br>breathlessness so people who come into<br>emergency who are Breathless<br>at the time it was difficult immediately<br>for the doctor emergency doctors to tell<br>was that person breathless because they<br>had heart disease or were they<br>breathless because they had some sort of<br>pulmonary lung disease or a combination<br>now these are a little complex but<br>I'll take a little time to explain them<br>this is those 52 patients or 54 patients<br>um<br>this is their level of plasma B and P<br>that was measured as soon as they got<br>into emergency department the patients<br>who had primary lung disease had lower<br>levels than these patients who had heart<br>failure<br>and in in the subset of patient patients<br>who actually had both heart failure and<br>primary lung disease<br>their bmps were high reflecting their<br>heart failure<br>this was a<br>important information that our the world<br>also thought was important too because<br>it was published in in one of the two<br>premiered medical journals in the world<br>the Lancet<br>this plot here<br>is called a receiver operator curve and<br>basically the further you move towards<br>top left hand corner of<br>the square rectangle the better your<br>test is for detecting heart failure this<br>was the then current gold standard left<br>ventricular ejection fraction or the<br>amount a measure of the function of the<br>heart the amount of blood that the heart<br>pumped out with each beat<br>but here is BMP and amp actually being<br>more specific for for and more sensitive<br>for diagnosing those patients who had<br>in the in the um in the discussion of<br>that paper<br>um<br>my colleagues wrote Our finding that<br>plasma B and P is raised in dyspnea<br>called breathless patients with heart<br>failure but not an acutely breathless<br>patients with pulmonary lung disease<br>suggests that rapid BNP assays May<br>assist in the diagnosis of patients with<br>actually our bright biochemist and and<br>clinicians were not satisfied with just<br>looking at BNP they decided to ask the<br>question does this portion of the BNP<br>before we were measuring that does this<br>portion of the BMP molecule also<br>circulate in plasma no under that data<br>had decided it had discovered that that<br>was indeed circulating in our plasma and<br>could be measured<br>so this is very complicated I'm not<br>going to go through everything but<br>basically this is the radio amino acid<br>which shows that yes<br>samples do show that it follows the same<br>shape of that curve this is n-terminal<br>the the the the left hand portion of the<br>molecule<br>being measured in the plasma and it<br>actually isn't in ratio with BMP itself<br>and here are samples drawn from patients<br>which show that it is indeed<br>both circulating in the blood and also<br>because this white column this is the<br>venous drainage of the heart itself is<br>higher than the aorta it shows that it<br>and probably more important is<br>the filled in circles here are the<br>n-terminal prone B<br>Pro BMP in normals they have levels like<br>this and the comparison here is to BMP<br>the mature form itself<br>patients with hypertension or or high<br>blood pressure have slightly elevated<br>this is the individual patients and this<br>is the the mean of the group<br>but as you look at patients with heart<br>failure and this really is a group of<br>non asymptomatic heart failure patients<br>and then moderate but increasing<br>severity of symptoms the levels of<br>so there was a real need for for<br>cardiologists who were seeing<br>heart failure patients and every day in<br>their clinics and in the emergency<br>department to be able to look have an<br>independent Diagnostic and prognostic<br>Mark is across a spectrum of<br>cardiovascular disease<br>both for those patients who just have<br>early risk factors<br>early signs of actual changes in the<br>structure and function of the heart<br>patients with symptoms and patients with<br>Advanced diseases and over quite a<br>probably a 10 to 15 years<br>many studies across the world actually<br>showed that both BNP and n-terminal BMP<br>is an excellent biomarker across all of<br>these the the full spectrum of patients<br>with heart disease including our own<br>this is our own work here but but we did<br>work at various levels across here<br>so by 2005<br>um<br>for as a diagnostic test for heart<br>failure was an all the major guidelines<br>for what cardiologists and doctors<br>should follow to determine whether a<br>patient had heart failure this is uh<br>2005 and but the the two main American<br>college and American Heart Association<br>guidelines it was also in the European<br>guidelines<br>2005 this was first suggested by our<br>group 11 years before in 1994.<br>so that just shows that Christchurch<br>this is this is a teaser I'm not going<br>to talk about this but this is Richard<br>troughton's um area<br>a big part of the work that he did<br>Richard is giving his inaugural<br>professorial lecture in March the 19th I<br>think it is and I'm sure that he will<br>talk about this but BNP can also be used<br>to guide the potentially to guide the<br>I'm going to break my conclusions in in<br>into a number of different ones just for<br>when we move to the next area but the<br>Christchurch Institute Laboratories have<br>led the world for several decades in<br>developing assays for the heart and<br>other vasoactive hormones<br>and the natural peptides are established<br>as biomarkers across a wide spectrum of<br>cardiac disease and can improve<br>diagnosis prognosis management and<br>gonna get back on track with my story<br>now<br>because this is taking us back to March<br>1988 when I was an essay technician<br>measuring um the natural peptides and<br>blood<br>the young me over here<br>actually in the group at the same time<br>we had uh who was now Professor Vicki<br>Cameron who did sheep studies<br>Vicky had just completed her PhD was<br>also expecting her first baby and was<br>also going to go soon to San Diego to<br>reinvent herself not as a sheep doctor<br>but as a DNA and and genetic doctor<br>so knowing that I knew a wee bit at<br>least about sheep and that I was a<br>budding scientist Tim suggested to Eric<br>maybe when Vicky goes<br>Chris could switch to being our sheep<br>scientists rather than our essay<br>technician so Vicky flew off and I<br>switched over to the other side<br>this was also the time in July 1988 that<br>I first met Mark Richards Mark has gone<br>on to become the the head director of<br>the Heart Institute he was a<br>cardiologist working at pmh who was<br>actually doing very similar studies<br>which to which I was about to embark on<br>but he did the in humans I took the<br>career path of of doing animal studies<br>in parallel to those<br>so over the next<br>um three or four years<br>I actually started doing my PhD in the<br>group<br>this was as the title of my PhD studies<br>on the integrative<br>matters how things work together and<br>physiological role of the naturitic<br>peptides these heart hormones I've been<br>talking about using instrumented sheep<br>as an experimental model<br>I've got a picture of Eric there because<br>Eric was my sole supervisor during the<br>course of my PhD he was he was my main<br>Mentor at that time and in the early<br>stages of my career he certainly knocked<br>me into shape and taught me how to be<br>what obviously became a<br>scientist of some note otherwise I<br>wouldn't be standing here before you<br>today but we all need great mentors and<br>and Eric<br>um as as second to none in his mentoring<br>skills<br>the question that we first asked at that<br>time was what is the physiological role<br>of ANP<br>I've cheated I couldn't find a picture<br>of Mark from the late 80s this is a<br>picture of him from 2004 I think from<br>the program of his inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>but anyway the way that we did this was<br>vehicle-controlled infusions and normal<br>conscious sheep that was what I did so<br>we infused the natural peptides into<br>sheep elevated the levels just by a<br>small amount to have a look at what they<br>did and in parallel Mark was doing very<br>similar studies in humans<br>so we were working together as a team<br>this is from my first scientific<br>publication this is the study that I<br>just described<br>so this is over a 24-hour period of<br>infusion<br>here is the we used to call a and F then<br>but here is the A and P these are the<br>normal levels on the day that the Sheep<br>didn't get an infusion and we increased<br>the levels of amp circulating in the<br>blood by only two to three fold this is<br>well within the range that that you<br>could see in any one of us even if we<br>didn't have heart disease in this room<br>it increases what is the the second<br>messenger<br>within the cells and these are the types<br>of effects that it had on arterial blood<br>pressure consistently lowering it while<br>the infusion was going in by 10 to 15<br>millimeters of mercury for the systolic<br>pressure that's the high number of the<br>blood pressure when you get your blood<br>pressure taken and the mean arterial<br>pressure and also reduced the filling<br>this is very much like what debolts or<br>when he did that crude experiment back<br>way back in the early 80s<br>showing that hematopra increased when<br>hemat increases it actually tells us<br>there's more red blood cells in the<br>blood sample that we draw the reason for<br>that is because it actually reduces the<br>circulating blood volume water<br>flows out of the blood vessels and into<br>other parts of the body so the relative<br>proportion of red blood cells is higher<br>and here is the urine sodium output in<br>on the black days is the day we gave the<br>amp so it increases sodium excretion so<br>even at very low levels of of<br>manipulating the levels of amp we saw<br>physiological actions a number of<br>different sites<br>so a whole lot of studies from ourselves<br>and sheep and in men and studies from<br>the other from other labs in the world<br>go together to informing this diagram<br>and this is really what integrative<br>physiology is about understanding<br>so here's the heart<br>when the atrium of the heart is<br>stretched or or the pressure increase it<br>releases the Nitric peptides into the<br>circulation amp and BNP that then acts<br>on quite a number of different organs<br>except the adrenal gland to reduce<br>aldosterone which is a salt retaining<br>hormone it acts that the kidney to do<br>lots of things increases the filtration<br>of the blood increases sodium output and<br>urine output and decreases renin which<br>is another important uh part of the salt<br>retaining aspect of our body has Direct<br>effects on the blood vessels themselves<br>to directly lower blood pressure and<br>increase permeability all these things<br>feed are then combine to lower the blood<br>pressure and lower the plasma volume and<br>return things back to normal as they<br>should be again<br>so uh<br>one slide sums up probably 10 years of<br>work by many people here at Christchurch<br>and around the world<br>so<br>my second conclusions are firstly that<br>sheep are a good model of human heart<br>health and disease I haven't shown you<br>any disease States yet<br>but I will do later<br>amp and BNP these heart hormones are<br>physiologically relevant hormones that<br>contr contribute to the day-to-day<br>control of blood pressure and salt and<br>water balance in fact when you lie to if<br>you lie down for 30 minutes and then<br>stand up<br>your levels of amp and BNP will change<br>in your blood the heart will secrete<br>those hormones to to account for the<br>differences in in blood pressure and and<br>where blood is sitting in your body it's<br>but I<br>also another important conclusion is<br>that our collaborative approach<br>physiologists that's people like me<br>sheep scientists working in partnership<br>with clinicians like Mark and Eric and<br>biochemists and Assa and laboratory<br>scientists like Tim Yandel makes for a<br>world-class research group with the<br>ability to unravel the role of heart<br>hormones<br>so that brings us now to the mid 90s the<br>mid 90s is when I first met Gary Nichols<br>Gary had actually been instrumental<br>through the early 80s in in setting up<br>with Eric and with Mark in the early<br>days the work that we did on natural<br>peptides here had also worked on on<br>other things too then he went to Hong<br>Kong to become professor of medicine and<br>came back to Christchurch I think in 94<br>or 95 when he came back he found out<br>about this other family of hormones<br>adrenal Magellan and there are other<br>cousins of a dream Magellan is too<br>and and he said right let's look at this<br>in humans we doctors will do that and<br>you sheep scientists will you look at it<br>and sheep for us and so we'll work in<br>Partnership and work out what the role<br>of adrenal Magellan is<br>over the next<br>um over the next years just in cheap<br>studies not just me but Miriam who<br>you'll see a photo of soon had 20<br>Publications on on adrenal magellanship<br>studies so I'm just going to show you<br>one slide of results here<br>these are actually much higher levels<br>than we were infusing for the amp this<br>is a little bit more like back at<br>chemistry rather than than petite low<br>levels but nonetheless when you infuse<br>adrenal Magellan actually at two<br>different doses each for 90 minutes<br>here is the blood pressure going down<br>the arterial pressure The Filling<br>pressure of the heart rate of of the<br>heart the heart rate goes up the cardiac<br>output goes up the amount of blood that<br>is pumped per minute out of the heart<br>and the peripheral resistance the<br>resistance in in the blood vessels to<br>the blood are flowing through them goes<br>down<br>I'm not going to show you lots of slides<br>I'm just going to show you this<br>it's in color now because we're into the<br>90s rather than the rather than the late<br>late 80s but actually it's very similar<br>to the other<br>one that I showed adrenal Magellan has<br>effects at the heart<br>increases cut our heart rate<br>contractility Etc has effects in the in<br>the blood vessels themselves to reduce<br>peripheral resistance and blood pressure<br>at the adrenal gland and the kidney and<br>other areas as well<br>then we come into the 2000s 2002 or<br>thereabouts<br>was when we got introduced to yet<br>another family of hormones that our body<br>produced not actually from the heart but<br>from um from quite a number of different<br>sources in the body there produced this<br>is Miriam who who really<br>um<br>through most not quite as long as me but<br>most of my 25 years working here has<br>been my partner in crime in doing sheep<br>studies<br>um<br>Miriam Eric's at first suggested to<br>Miriam hey have you seen this paper on<br>your caution<br>it was very related to a hormone that<br>was well not quite a hormone a peptide<br>that was well known since the 50s<br>this is corticotrophen releasing hormone<br>which is involved in in the stress<br>hormonal stress response in the body<br>so there are similarities between the<br>Euro court and peptides and crh there<br>are actually two receptors on the cells<br>that these hormones bind to<br>and where is crh and actually you're a<br>quadrant one as well bind to this<br>receptor Euro court and two binds to<br>this number two receptor<br>so let's just see now what the uracutans<br>do this is a busy slide<br>this is studies that I did in normal<br>sheep and this is studies that Miriam<br>did in a pacing model of heart failure<br>if you Pace a sheep's heart for seven<br>days at 225 beats per minute<br>which is much higher than their resting<br>heart rate which is similar to ours<br>about 70 or 80. they exhibit all the<br>signs of a human with severe heart<br>failure<br>I'm going to concentrate on on the heart<br>failure um panel because that was much<br>more interesting Murray muffin got to do<br>more interesting work because she was<br>looking at the disease states which<br>showed bigger effects than we often saw<br>a normal sheep<br>so here is Euro court and two in this<br>instance given at three different doses<br>two hours apart big dramatic effects on<br>increasing cardiac output Falls in mean<br>arterial pressure<br>uh peripheral resistance and Big Falls<br>in left atrial pressure which is a key<br>index The Filling pressure of the heart<br>it's a it's a key index of severity of<br>heart failure and a target for<br>um treating heart failure as well<br>again concentrating on on the heart<br>failure<br>sheep because they did show better<br>results in this it also reduces aspects<br>of what we consider the bad hormones in<br>heart failure<br>um renin which is part of the Rain Ninja<br>tension system aldosterone and<br>endothelian one<br>and then here is the urine effect on<br>urine heart failure is volume and sodium<br>retaining in our body we have too much<br>water and too much salt which our<br>kidneys can't excrete but when you give<br>eurocortin two you you increase the<br>amount of urine coming out of the<br>kidneys and increase the amount of<br>sodium<br>so again<br>I'm not going to draw a complete<br>comparisons but another<br>family of hormones which have<br>integrative actions throughout the body<br>on many different organ systems so<br>conclusions three<br>the natural peptides are one of several<br>or probably even many vasoactive<br>hormones that have integrative actions<br>on the heart vascular<br>renal and other hormonal systems and the<br>Christchurch had Institute researchers<br>have developed a world-class reputation<br>for elucidating the role of vasovactive<br>hormones and health and disease<br>now is my second aside not this is my<br>own work but it's not about hormones now<br>so<br>hormones are not the only thing that<br>affect the heart<br>our most organs in our body are also<br>controlled and affected and regulated by<br>our nervous system<br>our nervous system is our brain talking<br>to our organs<br>we have sort of a yin and yang two two<br>different sets of nerves that travel<br>from our brain to our heart<br>under normal resting conditions the<br>parasympathetic or the vagus nerve which<br>comes directly from the brain to the<br>heart<br>uh exerts the major effect and that<br>gives us a slow rhythmical<br>um beating of the heart<br>if the sympathetic system this red one<br>becomes more activated<br>and the sympathetic nerves far at the<br>heart it makes the heart beat both<br>cardiac sympathetic nerve activity<br>measuring that sympathetic nerve<br>activity that is directed directly to<br>the heart<br>um<br>is Major it's of major importance in<br>cardiovascular disease<br>csna as I will call it is thought to be<br>involved in in the etiology or the cause<br>of left ventricular hypertrophy large<br>Hearts heart failure and arrhythmias the<br>short-circleding of of the electrical<br>signal of the heart<br>direct recordings of csna require an<br>operation to open the chest and that's<br>not ethical and is never going to be<br>done in humans and until recently<br>actually in the mid 90s because this is<br>an old slide no long-term recordings of<br>csna had been achieved in conscious<br>animals<br>so 1996 came along and Dave Jardine who<br>was then a a doctor working in Timaru<br>Hospital wanting to come back to<br>Christchurch<br>um meets me<br>and Dave and I<br>um in collaboration with a colleague in<br>Melbourne Clive may we developed a novel<br>method for measuring cadix and pathetic<br>his budding hearty Professor probably an<br>associate professor at that stage I<br>think and a very serious looking Dave<br>has many faces but he often looks like<br>that<br>this is my only real life shot of a<br>sheep I didn't want to show anything<br>that might offend or might upset you so<br>under this green sterile draping is a<br>sheep about to be operated on<br>no blood yet<br>so I'm showing how we do this in<br>cartoons<br>or diagram so basically we instrument<br>the Sheep by by<br>finding the sympathetic trunk<br>this is the nerves that are running long<br>alongside the vertebrae and finding the<br>nerves that come off them and into the<br>heart and impaling them with the finest<br>of needles and super gluing them in and<br>then we have other<br>um<br>uh catheters and arteries and veins so<br>that we can measure other things at the<br>same time this is a blown up but<br>stripped down shot of the heart so the<br>lungs have been well the chest is open<br>the lungs have been completely removed<br>so you can see the pericardium the sac<br>that the heart sits in is not there and<br>normally all of this is covered in in a<br>white member membranous type material<br>but this is all Stripped Away so you can<br>see here is the heart the ventricles The<br>Atrium the aorta going down the body and<br>the aorta going up to the heart up to<br>the head sorry and coming out of this<br>nerve trunk just underneath the spine<br>and the ribs are these very small nerves<br>when you look at these in reality they<br>look like a piece of dental floss<br>and then we impale them<br>stick our electrodes on so they won't<br>move just with ordinary household super<br>glue and then sew the Sheep back up<br>recover the sheep and have an ability to<br>measure the nerve firing and the<br>conscious animal<br>this is an example of what we see here<br>is the arterial pressure Trace<br>what you sometimes see on on on the<br>screen on TV medical programs and the<br>ECG<br>this is this is um a one minute period<br>this sheep here has been given<br>nitropresside a little like<br>nitroglycerin the the spray that some of<br>you may take when you have an angina<br>attack which vasodilates uh blood<br>vessels and lowers our blood pressure<br>this is the nerve<br>occasional spikes<br>being recorded at the beginning but as<br>we see the blood pressure drop<br>that you can see that the cardiac symbic<br>nerve starts firing more and more it<br>sense that the blood pressure is dropped<br>and it says I need to get that heart<br>kick started again to increase its blood<br>pressure and increase its heart rate<br>so at the time in the mid 90s late 90s<br>there was only our own lab in Clive's<br>lab in Melbourne who could do this in<br>what did we do once we knew that we<br>could do this we decided to look at what<br>cardiac sympathetic nerve activity did<br>during the course of a myocardial<br>infection or a heart attack<br>so this is a heart attack where where<br>the blood vessel<br>supplying the heart muscle itself<br>when it happens and and we humans it's<br>because we have a fatty plaque in here<br>which grows and grows and gets blocked<br>off and have probably eventually gets<br>blocked by a blood clot in there blocks<br>off this area here and kills the muscle<br>that is um below that in the arterial<br>tree<br>we don't feed our sheep on McDonald's<br>for 10 or 20 years so we have to do this<br>artificially so what we do is we simply<br>place a snare a stitch around the<br>coronary artery and we put a snare<br>around it<br>exteriorize that out through the chest<br>wall so that later on when the animal is<br>recovered we can tighten the snare and<br>block off the the flow of blood going<br>I won't spend a lot of time on this but<br>but this is this is a sheep that was<br>recorded cardiac some nerve activity<br>increasing as hours and days went by<br>this is the graph of it which shows<br>compared to sheep that didn't have and<br>in fact over the over the first hours<br>this is uh one two and three hours and<br>days out to seven days here is an<br>increase in the nerve firing to the<br>heart in response to myocardial<br>infarction<br>the world thought they knew that but had<br>never been demonstrated experimentally<br>before<br>sudden cardiac death post myocardial<br>infarction is also very important<br>so up to 50 percent of people die<br>suddenly especially after a myocardial<br>infarction and many of them actually<br>never make it into Hospital<br>um<br>and at the time that we were studying<br>the csna recordings the nerve recordings<br>to the heart had not been obtained<br>during when sudden cardiac death<br>happened when the heart went into<br>ventricular fibrillation<br>why is it so important<br>well here are some some about 10 year<br>old data from the us there at that time<br>there were nearly a million people die<br>of cardiovascular disease per year in<br>the U.S and of those million nearly a<br>quarter of them died of sudden cardiac<br>death of their hearts stopping beating<br>before they even got to hospital<br>a bigger problem<br>sudden cardiac death than lung cancer<br>breast cancer and AIDS all put together<br>so this was a sheep that we had hooked<br>up to our Mantra Montas we gave it a a a<br>a heart attack<br>um<br>in between this time and measured it<br>over the next I think this was 28<br>minutes later or something like that<br>what you can see is we had very low<br>level of nerve firing at the start there<br>was an increase uh some five minutes<br>after the coronary artery was included<br>this is 30 minutes after the occlusion<br>and you can see there's even more of an<br>interest increase especially when when<br>the heart started skipping occasional<br>beats so here is a skipped heartbeat<br>making the blood pressure fall and the<br>corresponding<br>spike in the cardiac sympathetic nerve<br>but this was fascinating about five or<br>ten seconds before<br>the heart stopped completely there was a<br>big increase in the nerve firing and a<br>big spike immediately before the beat<br>before that happened<br>and that's just showing that graphically<br>first time it had ever been demonstrated<br>that this the nerves fire immediately<br>before a um uh sudden cardiac death a<br>rhythmic death<br>we actually went on and looked at uh 10<br>sheep that had sudden cardiac death<br>compared to teen sheep that had had an<br>infarction but not died and we looked at<br>their cardiacs and nerve activity this<br>is just measured four different ways for<br>13 or 14 minutes beforehand and you can<br>see the group that died all had an<br>increase in cardiac symbic nerve<br>activity<br>so conclusions for<br>the chief physiology researchers are one<br>of a small handful now a few more than<br>just Melbourne here but probably only<br>five or six around the world groups and<br>the world that can measure cardiacs and<br>nerve activity and conscious large<br>animal model<br>as hypothesized but never before shown<br>directly csna has increased in the hours<br>and days following myocardial infarction<br>and it is likely that it contributes<br>greatly to lethal arrhythmias and sudden<br>cardiac death<br>okay so I'm going to get back now to the<br>onto the story of the naturitic peptides<br>this is work that we've done just in the<br>past four or five years from 2009 on<br>work instigated<br>um first by uh<br>uh our younger by a chemist not to<br>meandl but Chris pimpton now and<br>um Siri who was a PhD student working<br>with Chris<br>for some unknown reason<br>Chris asked the question does the signal<br>peptide<br>actually get out into the blood<br>for years the textbooks have said that<br>the signal peptide is only involved in<br>in<br>addressing the peptide to show where it<br>should go within the cell and then it<br>probably just gets degraded but Chris<br>asked the question does it get out of<br>the cell and is it secreted and<br>circulate in the blood<br>to this day I don't know why he asked<br>that question<br>so that was the question he asked and<br>not only does it circulate but could it<br>be a potential biomarker like BNP and<br>the n-terminal BMP part of the molecu<br>are<br>again<br>I'm not going to go in detail but this<br>is just to show that they could measure<br>it with their essay here are levels that<br>give numbers not zeros and in this<br>bottom panel here shows that when you<br>look at what comes out of the venous<br>drainage of various organs in the body<br>that the levels are raised for example<br>draining the head draining the heart and<br>the femoral vein<br>Etc<br>this is this is for the biochemus I'm<br>not going to show you but but this is<br>actually the gold standard to show that<br>Mass spectrometry to show that what<br>Chris was measuring with his essay was<br>he then proceeded to look at what<br>happens in in blood levels of patients<br>who are admitted with a heart attack who<br>have just arrived at emergency<br>department and draw samples over the<br>next hours<br>and days after and see if it could<br>measure the BMP signal peptide and<br>harrot compared to the more traditional<br>biomackers these are the traditional<br>biomarkers that doctors use each and<br>every day troponin creatine kinase and<br>not used as much but myoglobin here is<br>BNP signal peptide<br>rising over<br>just very early after half an hour or an<br>hour after the patients first got to<br>emergency department<br>this is one of those curves that I<br>showed earlier and you'll remember I<br>said<br>closely you can get to the top left<br>quadrant of this graph the better the<br>biomarker is for specificity and<br>sensitivity and<br>uh troponin the one that is usually used<br>is is green and BNP signal peptide was<br>as good as troponin but interestingly<br>appeared much earlier which means the<br>so is BNP signal peptide just a passive<br>if you so to ask that question<br>Chris and Siri did do some studies in in<br>a in a rat hat just beating on the bench<br>not in the whole animal but they came to<br>me and said Chris we should do a study<br>in sheep to see if BNP signal peptide<br>actually improves the heart when you're<br>having a heart attack<br>here is Grace from that study<br>this is ours along here and then turning<br>into days as we go across the animals<br>were anesthetized for this because they<br>had to have an operation to get at their<br>heart<br>they had during this period an infusion<br>into the into the vein of BNP signal<br>peptide<br>the coronary arteries were then ligated<br>blocked off for 19 minutes period and<br>then actually the the snare was released<br>so the artery was reperfused as well<br>there was not much different between the<br>group that didn't receive BNP signal<br>peptide and the group that did An Open<br>Circles BMP signal peptide and their<br>response of cardiac output Min arterial<br>pressure and heart rate but when you<br>looked at the markers of how severe that<br>heart attack was this is troponin<br>measured over over hours and days<br>the higher your troponin the more severe<br>your heart attack<br>in the animals that were treated with<br>BMP signal peptide the red lines apart<br>from one Rogue blue one are all lower<br>than than the ones that didn't and here<br>is the amount of troponin<br>uh that's my granddaughter blowing<br>raspberries<br>amount of troponin where you didn't have<br>BNB signal peptide<br>greatly improved lowered when the this<br>peptide is given<br>and we actually<br>um because this is an animal model we<br>can look at the hearts afterwards as<br>well the animals were actually<br>euthanized after seven days this is not<br>fresh art but it's a cross-section<br>through a heart that has been in effect<br>pickled or preserved in Formula the way<br>that um<br>space tissue specimens usually are but<br>you can see the difference here this is<br>the heart tissue here that is still good<br>and healthy if not pickled but this is<br>the area here that has been killed and<br>is dead and non-functioning the in fact<br>when we measured the size of the in fact<br>in the control sheet that didn't receive<br>BNP signal peptide but did have the<br>heart attack compared to the group that<br>did have BNP signal peptide it had<br>reduced the size of the damage to the<br>heart as well<br>so my last conclusion before I move on<br>to some thanks is that BNP signal<br>peptide shows early promise as a<br>potential therapeutic drug in myocardial<br>infection or heart attack<br>you know many times people ask me have<br>you made any new discoveries this week<br>or even have you made any new<br>discoveries this year<br>and I I have to answer them and say well<br>to me the world of science is a bit like<br>a huge jigsaw puzzle this is only a very<br>small jigsaw puzzle of a heart there's<br>actually millions and millions of pieces<br>to fit into the jigsaw puzzle and we are<br>working at putting one piece in at a<br>time<br>so we don't usually make big Quantum<br>leaks leaps and discoveries but I like<br>this quote which actually came from the<br>European Society of European Congress of<br>Cardiology<br>a few years ago basic design science is<br>defining New pieces in the puzzle to<br>understand cardiovascular disease as a<br>prerequisite to develop novel<br>therapeutic options and that's what<br>we're a big part of what we are working<br>about here in the Christchurch Institute<br>so I'm just going to finish up with some<br>thanks I should thank our major fund<br>bodies this is the health research<br>Council a direct government-funded body<br>for most of the last 25 years they have<br>funded all all or at least a major<br>proportion of my salary<br>they haven't funded me for 25 years<br>continuous they fund me three years at a<br>time if we put in Grants which are good<br>enough and competitive enough to be in<br>the top 10 percent of those that are put<br>in<br>the Heart Foundation has not funded my<br>salary but as over many of the years<br>have funded the salaries of technicians<br>who are invaluable in the work and the<br>money we need to purchase the sheep and<br>to do the essays and to do all the<br>surgeries and and the like so big thanks<br>to the funding major funding agencies<br>you know most people in their Scientific<br>careers have one Mentor who has been<br>very good to them<br>I've been fortunate enough as most of us<br>in in the uh how Institute have been to<br>have three World very excellent<br>world-class<br>researchers<br>and both over the period of my career<br>all three have mentored me in at<br>different times Mark is the still the<br>overall director he's a still a<br>cardiologist<br>Eric was my first PhD supervisor<br>continues to work in the group even<br>though he supposedly retired about 12<br>years ago<br>Gary is retired now but still haunts the<br>Department of Medicine Corridor he was<br>he's here today but he I saw him in his<br>office as well as a little cubby hole<br>really yesterday I'm not sure if he was<br>in today<br>Mark is not old enough to retire yet but<br>is mad enough actually to do twice as<br>much work about four years ago he<br>continued to do be our director and he<br>now works in Singapore as well and has<br>set up a group nearly as large as ours<br>there so<br>even when he worked here he worked about<br>200 or 250 percent of what most people<br>do and now he does twice as much he's an<br>amazing guy<br>these are the other senior members of<br>the Heart Institute the leaders of the<br>group Richard who I didn't talk much<br>about his work he he's the cardiologist<br>who is on the ground and doing all the<br>hard work at the moment well Mark is<br>swanning off in Singapore but not really<br>Vicky who runs the genetics lab Tim<br>who's senior retired and Chris over in<br>our essay biochemistry lab and Miriam<br>who I've mentioned to is is my closest<br>colleague really we work on an<br>laboratory side by side in the animal<br>lab we've had offices side by side for<br>20 plus years and and we work extremely<br>well together as a team and then<br>seeing as I am the physiologist in the<br>group at what Mary Manaya physiologists<br>in the group this is the real hardcore<br>over the past 15 years of the physiology<br>team so Miriam you do so much work that<br>you get you picture up there twice<br>here's Dave that he's still got sort of<br>a sort of a serious look on his face and<br>two excellent technicians who Gavin just<br>finished up last year and Rachel who<br>um have both been around for 15 years<br>and done much of the Hands-On work for<br>the work that I've described<br>and so with that I'd just like to thank<br>you remind you that it is heart week<br>there is an appeal for the national<br>Heart Foundation<br>if you think that the national Heart<br>Foundation gives a lot of money to our<br>group<br>they give money to other groups around<br>the country for research that do a lot<br>of help um health education and and work<br>as well<br>um so yes just remember it's heart week<br>of generously<br>we need your money to keep on doing more<br>great work thank you<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
