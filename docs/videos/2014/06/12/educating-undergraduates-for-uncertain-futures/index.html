of atago<br>atago good evening um it sounds like you<br>were all having quite a nice time before<br>we came in here sorry to interrupt your<br>conversation but we have some important<br>business here um on behalf of the<br>University of Vago it is my great<br>pleasure to welcome um University staff<br>and students uh to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture um it's also my<br>great pleasure to welcome members of the<br>general public um who so kindly support<br>um these events with their attendance<br>and I'd like to add special words of<br>Welcome to Rachel's family um who I know<br>who are here um her parents her husband<br>and her children who I'm sure are happy<br>to be identified right now um but it is<br>fantastic um to have you here with us to<br>celebrate in Rachel's success now those<br>of you come to these things regularly<br>know that I often say that this is the<br>highlight of my week um and part of the<br>reason for that obviously is that it<br>gives me at least one hour a week um<br>where I have to do virtually nothing um<br>except um learn from the Brilliant Minds<br>of the University of itago<br>professorate um but recently when I've<br>been reflecting on the anago<br>professorial lectures over this past<br>year I realized that this is a really<br>favorite part of the week for me for<br>another reason and that is um that these<br>lectures actually keep me<br>honest um part of my job on a daily<br>basis is to spend a lot of time talking<br>to Outsiders about the University of<br>itago and every once in a while I think<br>it's very important for me to get a<br>reality check um to see whether or not<br>the sales pitch that I'm giving um is<br>actually an accurate reflection of what<br>is going on around here so as I was<br>reflecting on Rachel's contribution to<br>the university of itago um I'm reminded<br>of two things that I talk about quite<br>often when I speak to members of the<br>general public the first thing um is<br>that I spend a lot of time speaking to<br>alumni about the importance of their<br>lifelong connection to the University of<br>atago and I think it's important in that<br>context to point out that Rachel is not<br>the only member of her family um who is<br>heavily embedded in this University um<br>her father Dr Ross Smith uh studied<br>medicine here in the 1940s and he also<br>taught for us um as a student uh in the<br>program of radiology um her husband<br>Harold um also studied for his ba here<br>uh in history um her sister Mandy um<br>studied postgraduate nursing um and her<br>mother Joy has actually done a<br>considerable amount of acting um for<br>medical school clinical scenarios um and<br>she's also been a life um long member of<br>the denan city choir that also has a<br>very long um standing relationship with<br>the University of atago two of her<br>nephews William and Thomas um currently<br>study here at the University of atago um<br>and I'm told that her daughter Abby at<br>the age of six um produced a business<br>card listing herself as a research<br>assistant<br>here so we are expecting big things um<br>out of future generations of the<br>spronken Smith family so within New<br>Zealand these kinds of intergen<br>generational<br>relationships um to a university are<br>actually somewhat unique to the<br>University of aago<br>um our age and our reputation make them<br>possible and the fact that they exist<br>and continue to grow make us even<br>stronger as an<br>institution now the other thing that<br>Rachel's career highlights for me um is<br>the value that we place on teaching here<br>at the University of itago and those of<br>you who are members of the academic<br>staff here um will be well aware of the<br>fact that we had some welcome discussion<br>earlier in the year about the relative<br>importance that the university places on<br>teaching and research<br>and Rachel's career um really<br>personifies my own view um about the<br>relationship of these two activities um<br>indicating that both of them are equally<br>important and that in order to become a<br>professor here we actually demand<br>Excellence uh in both Rachel is<br>obviously highly committed to the<br>creation of new knowledge through her<br>research but she is equally committed to<br>the dissemination of that knowledge to<br>inspire young and sometimes not so young<br>minds as as the former head of HC Rachel<br>took on the challenge of actually making<br>this university community better<br>teachers and most recently she has taken<br>on the challenge of being the dean of<br>our new school of graduate research so I<br>think she clearly exemplifies the ex the<br>kind of academic that we try to Foster<br>here people who are highly committed to<br>those dual activities of teaching and<br>research I will now hand over to the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor academic and<br>international Professor Vernon Squire<br>who will tell us just a little bit more<br>professorship thank you Vice Chancellor<br>it's my pleasure to provide a brief<br>biography for tonight's IPL speaker<br>Rachel Rachel began study at atago in<br>1984 graduating four years later with a<br>BSC honors in<br>geography she then then worked in the<br>New Zealand meteorological Service as an<br>agricultural me meteorologist for two<br>years before moving to Vancouver to do<br>doctoral study in GE geography at the<br>University of British<br>Columbia she graduated from there in<br>1994 with her thesis winning the gene<br>Elder prize for the best doctoral thesis<br>by a woman at UBC University of British<br>Columbia Rachel then returned to a<br>teaching position in New Zealand in<br>geography at the University of<br>Canterbury where she worked for 9<br>years she completed a postgraduate<br>diploma in tertiary teaching through<br>ataro in<br>2002 that really changed her life and<br>that sparked her interest in research in<br>higher<br>education as a result she moved back to<br>denan in 2004 to take up a senior Lector<br>ship at the higher education<br>Development Center where she worked as<br>an academic staff<br>developer she also continued to teach in<br>geography and that's been a constant<br>theme through Rachel's career where<br>she's kept two balls in the air uh for<br>most of that career Rachel was head of<br>HC from 200 uh 2009 until<br>2012 and has led many initiatives at at<br>Targo including the spotlight on<br>teaching colloquia<br>the women women in leadership um at a<br>Targo program and many other courses for<br>staff and graduate students<br>particularly Rachel has also won three<br>teaching Awards one at the University of<br>Canterbury and T to tago for Supervision<br>in<br>2012 and teaching in<br>2013 her research interests still span<br>geography particularly Urban climatology<br>ology and higher education with<br>interests in undergraduate research and<br>inquiry curriculum change and graduate<br>attributes and as harling said Rachel is<br>now the dean of our graduate research<br>school I could go on and tell you more<br>about Rachel's success in getting<br>research funding her<br>Publications and the large amount of<br>supervision she does but it's time to<br>hear from Rachel professor spron and<br>Smith I invite you to tell us about<br>educating<br>undergraduates for uncertain Futures<br>thank<br>you K and thank you for that welcome<br>Vernon as I celebrate this promotion<br>there are many people I would like to<br>thank and you'll see the business card<br>has made it up there Abby she didn't<br>realize I'd kept it all his Years first<br>and foremost my family Harold Liam and<br>Abby for believing in me when I didn't<br>they never doubted I would make it to my<br>parents joy and Ross I feel so<br>privileged to have you here this evening<br>you've been a fabulous source of Support<br>over the years all those after school<br>pickups those<br>meals um have enabled me to keep working<br>fulltime and to make it today and Mom<br>you're a terrific proof reader<br>thanks also to my nephew<br>Willie for his after school care and<br>house sitting during his time at<br>University including rushing the dogs to<br>the vet when they consumed an entire<br>block of<br>chocolate a few geographers from<br>Canterbury also deserve special mention<br>Professor Eric porson was one of my<br>heads of Department there he was a true<br>inspiration and Professor Wendy Lawson<br>for sharing dreams and Dearing me to<br>seize new<br>opportunities here at atago I've been<br>fortunate to have many support of<br>colleagues in HDC far too many to<br>mention them all however special thanks<br>to Tony Harland and Carol bond for<br>mentoring me into higher education<br>research as well as to Rosemary McBride<br>Nikki hunt Angela French Candy Young for<br>their superb administrative support<br>thanks also to the staff in The Graduate<br>research school where I'm thoroughly<br>enjoying my new position finally thanks<br>to the mentors and inspiring colleagues<br>that I've had over years particularly my<br>PhD supervisor at UBC Tim Oak MC hey<br>from gler Terry Crux from the College of<br>Education as and also members of NZ will<br>who were some fabulous mentors Lyall hon<br>and Nicola pet I'm not sure if Nicola's<br>here but her quip to me a few years ago<br>about of course you should apply for<br>Professor within four years of making<br>associate professor actually led me to<br>make this<br>application so thanks to all those<br>people at an event a couple of years ago<br>entitled research on a plate I took that<br>quite literally and discuss my research<br>interests and in the good kiwi tradition<br>of meat and three vegetables here they<br>are the background is climatology<br>particularly Urban climatology my staple<br>is undergraduate research and inquiry<br>I'm passionate about promoting such<br>approach such approaches for<br>undergraduates<br>the meat is the uh curriculum change the<br>means to improve learning experiences<br>for students and the carrots are<br>graduate attributes a more recent focus<br>of research and the source as high<br>impact educational experiences in<br>today's lecture I'm actually going to<br>Pur these interests together to give you<br>an indication of how they're interl but<br>I also have another<br>agenda a drive to graduate students who<br>are well equipped for uncertain Futures<br>with a captive audience I would like to<br>make a plea for providing research and<br>inquiry opportunities to<br>undergraduates not only through summer<br>research programs but through mainstream<br>activities by doing so I think we can<br>foster desirable skills and attributes<br>that will stand our graduates in good<br>stead for uncertain Futures and you'll<br>note that my examples are infused with a<br>strong geography flavor<br>throughout being a geographer I have to<br>have a map of some sort so here is a map<br>of my session first I'm going to touch<br>on uncertain Futures then I'm going to<br>think about implications for<br>graduates having identified some<br>desirable graduates uh attribute<br>graduate attributes I'm then going to<br>discuss how we might actually teach<br>towards them particularly focusing in on<br>inquiry and undergraduate research<br>experiences both within the curriculum<br>and extracurricular<br>activities finally I'm going to touch on<br>how students know about what they're<br>getting out of their education how can<br>we help them realize what they've<br>achieved<br>and this will help close the loop<br>towards securing jobs and you'll notice<br>that I use these icons throughout as a<br>road map through the<br>lecture I thought it was bit Brave of me<br>to put up a quote like this at the start<br>of this but I will try and read it<br>without getting Tongue Tied as we know<br>there are known unknowns there are<br>things we know we know we also know<br>there are Known Unknown that is to say<br>we know there are some things we do not<br>know but there are also unknown unknowns<br>the ones we don't know we don't<br>no so what are these<br>unknown I'm going to begin by discussing<br>unsu and Futures and draw on The Tale of<br>Two Ronnies but not the ones you're<br>probably familiar with Ron Johnston is a<br>distinguished geographer and many of you<br>will know his daughter Lucy Johnston<br>who's my counterpart at Canterbury<br>University in 1997 Ron Johnston said the<br>purpose of higher education was to focus<br>on the ability to solve new problems and<br>the ability to resolve insoluble<br>problems with disciplines as a vehicle<br>to develop critical<br>thinking Ron Barnett an eminent higher<br>educationalist used the term super<br>complexity to characterize a world where<br>interactions can never be completely<br>resolved he argued that there are two<br>forms of uncertainty resulting from this<br>super complexity the first was an<br>uncertainty from the rapid expansion of<br>knowledge and the inability to actually<br>know at all and the second was a<br>personal uncertainty since we could<br>never hope to satisfactory describe the<br>world let alone act with assuredness in<br>it so this is an uncertainty over being<br>in the world on top of this we have<br>uncertainty over the global economy as<br>well as climate and environmental<br>changes there is also the changing job<br>market although I suspect this is not<br>new but perhaps the nature of employment<br>has<br>changed so what does this mean for<br>graduate<br>as Ron Barett would argue we need to<br>help them to be an uncertain world we<br>have witnessed changing job markets and<br>uncertain futures for<br>graduates magia and gu in 2004 suggested<br>that owing to the changing nature of<br>work within many countries around the<br>world future graduates of all<br>disciplines need to be prepared for the<br>prospect of portfolio careers this<br>results from a career pattern that<br>includes periods of employment<br>self-employment and unemployment<br>a report by leeran and heway in 2000 on<br>geography graduates employability noted<br>that due to the changing nature of<br>employment in the US and New Zealand<br>jobs were shifting to a more project<br>oriented Focus so there was an increased<br>emphasis on dealing with Technical and<br>transferable skills and<br>flexibility therefore we need to focus<br>on enhancing these employability skills<br>as well as assisting students to get<br>jobs so we need to focus not only on<br>their knowledge but the skill set that<br>they gain we need to give them<br>understanding and experience of work<br>within an Enterprise project-oriented<br>culture David hiot another geographer in<br>a 2012 editorial of the Journal of<br>geography and higher education talked<br>about global education for Global<br>challenges he noted the increasing<br>desire to produce Global Citizens and he<br>drew on O'Brien's work to talk about<br>three forms of literacy digital literacy<br>the ability to communicate across<br>digital and communication<br>Technologies Cultural Literacy empathy<br>and understanding to Divergent World<br>Views and socio communicative literacy<br>the ability to negotiate across multiple<br>perspectives to develop collaborative<br>products so we must ensure that our<br>programs Foster these literacies and<br>this will help them to compete for jobs<br>interconnectedness do our graduates<br>think think they are well prepared for<br>portfolio careers have they gained a<br>broad skill set with a host of<br>transferable<br>skills I would like to share with you<br>some findings from one of my first foray<br>into higher education research the atago<br>Millennium graduate project working with<br>colleagues in hgdc in 2004 we surveyed<br>and interviewed science and Humanity<br>students who graduated in the year 2000<br>so it was four years after graduation<br>amongst other questions we asked them<br>about the purpose of high education<br>drawing on phenomenography WE identified<br>four orientations of higher education so<br>for Craig a degree was seen as a ticket<br>to a job it was a physical piece of<br>paper he could lose it down the back of<br>a<br>fireplace and this orientation the goal<br>of higher education was very outcome<br>oriented with the degree achieving the<br>job so this is from Sam and in this<br>orientation the focus was still on<br>credentials but there was recognition<br>that the skill set was broader It Was<br>preparing for a range of jobs rather<br>than for a specific<br>job so in this orientation the purpose<br>of higher education was twofold both<br>credentialism but also on learning how<br>to think this was perhaps the most<br>contextually balanced view rather than<br>outcome oriented this orientation was<br>more process oriented with a focus on<br>developing intellectual skills so in<br>this final orientation there was<br>actually no mention of jobs it was<br>rather a focus on education for its own<br>sake the degree was internal part of who<br>you are it was integral to the person so<br>you can see that for some graduates<br>they're realizing a more holistic view<br>of their higher education and will<br>likely be well placed to cope with<br>uncertainty but for others they have a<br>very narrow instrumental View and indeed<br>the likes of Craig were quite<br>disaffected when their degree hadn't<br>achieved that specific job that they<br>were<br>seeking so I'd like to move on now and<br>think about what shapes these<br>orientations so you can see there are<br>many things there but the one that I'm<br>particularly interested in C uh<br>curricular experiences and certainly our<br>Millennium graduates mention powerful<br>curriculum experiences particularly<br>undergraduate research and inquiry type<br>activities that helped shift their<br>orientations from what might have<br>initially been quite credentialist<br>view so how can we educate our<br>undergraduates for un certain Futures<br>well as Barnett said there's nothing new<br>in the need for learning for an unknown<br>future as the future has always been<br>unknown our task as Educators is to<br>prepare students for a super complex<br>World in which incomplete judgments or<br>decisions have to be made either because<br>of time or insufficient evidence Barnet<br>argues that the task is an ontological<br>one a matter of learning to live with<br>uncertainty the human qualities and<br>dispositions that Barnet proposed<br>included carefulness thoughtfulness<br>humility criticality receptiveness<br>resilience courage and<br>Stillness for pedagogy this means less<br>emphasis on Knowledge and Skills but<br>these are still necessary and more about<br>students gaining a sense of themselves<br>and of the relationships with the world<br>around them a pedagogy for an unknown<br>future Barnett says becomes a pedagogy<br>with the unknown built into it as a<br>fundamental principle exposure to<br>dilemmas and uncertainties that is a<br>curriculum for super<br>complexity Val and no lent whistle added<br>to Barnet list a disposition of<br>understanding for oneself and they said<br>that this had three elements learning<br>strategies which required a good grasp<br>of the essence of knowledge and academic<br>discourse in the subject willingness to<br>put on the time and effort to apply the<br>learning strategies effectively and<br>alertness to the context within which<br>learning is taking place they said that<br>if we could do that we would be able to<br>help students cope with uncertain<br>futures<br>councelor mcon went on to talk about<br>ways of thinking and<br>practicing and you can see their quote<br>there about what that means it's quite a<br>it so ways of thinking and practicing<br>can potentially Encompass anything<br>students learn which helps them develop<br>a sense of what it might mean to be part<br>of a particular disciplinary Community<br>they said that the disposition to<br>understand for oneself leads to a<br>continuing determination to use acquired<br>knowledge and ways of thinking and<br>practicing in new contexts something<br>that's key to dealing with uncertain<br>Futures and being in the world I like<br>the phrase ways of thinking and<br>practicing as it goes beyond terms such<br>as graduate attributes which tend to<br>evoke lists of skills and attributes<br>that may be desirable the phrase ways of<br>thinking and practicing in genders more<br>state of knowing being and acting so it<br>relates to Ron Barnett's notion of<br>educating for being in the<br>world I'd now like to get you to think<br>about how you think and practice and how<br>you educate for those of you who do<br>educate here<br>undergraduates picking up on mun and<br>entwistle's ways of thinking and<br>practicing how does a geographer or a<br>psychologist or a geologist or a<br>philosopher think and practice what is<br>at the heart of disciplinary reason<br>it's important to articulate in role<br>model for students what thought<br>processes you go through so they can try<br>and develop their own disciplinary<br>reasoning as an expert it's often<br>difficult to try and unpack how you<br>think for your students yet knowing<br>these processes is crucial to their<br>development Clinton Golding an HDC<br>colleague in a 2011 paper discussed how<br>to promote critical thinking he advised<br>Educators to make critical thinking<br>visible and concrete by being explicit<br>about the questions their expert<br>critical thinkers address and setting up<br>the educative environment so that<br>students ask and address these same<br>questions which in turn enables them to<br>be critical thinkers he advocates for<br>reverse engineering of the thinking of<br>an expert so students can learn how<br>disciplinary experts think and the sort<br>of questions that they ask I'm going to<br>show you a series of um sequence of<br>images from the series of earthquakes in<br>Canterbury as you watch these images I<br>want you to think using your<br>disciplinary lens what are you thinking<br>about what questions are you asking<br>yourself please think of some questions<br>and be prepared to discuss them with<br>again so using that disciplinary lens<br>asking right if you could turn and talk<br>to your neighbor for a couple of minutes<br>okay if I could just draw you back<br>together is anyone willing to share a<br>disciplinary view of the sorts of<br>questions that you're asking<br>yes I've got an H health and safety<br>background so I was thinking gosh you<br>sir must have had fun grid searching<br>there who was hurt how did they extract<br>them I bet the communication plan was<br>fun Oh look The Bary Army power of<br>social media oh look they're using New<br>Zealand Army that's a good thing rather<br>than sending them off to war and then<br>look at blank canvas we can create<br>something completely new all right thank<br>you now we got somebody from a science<br>the okay arts or Humanities anyone here<br>who's willing to share about how<br>frighten that little boy must have<br>been right how frighten the little boy<br>would have been yes any other<br>okay thank you for that certainly when I<br>gave a version of this part of this<br>lecture at least to the um to<br>geographers at the Royal Society<br>geography conference last year the<br>geographers and the audience volunteered<br>things like um was the risk known and<br>was Society prepared how was<br>infrastructure affected how did people<br>respond who and where how extensive was<br>the damage and were their spatial<br>differences and then uh with these l<br>last images how is space and place being<br>reinvented so they're the sorts of um<br>questions um but how do your students<br>develop reasoning in your discipline or<br>profession how would they learn to ask<br>questions assisting students to develop<br>disciplinary ways of thinking and<br>practicing involves them learning both<br>disciplinary knowledge as well as skills<br>and values first thinking about<br>disciplinary knowledge using threshold<br>concept Concepts is a useful way to<br>think about core disciplinary knowledge<br>mayor and land said that threshold<br>concepts are conceptual gateways or<br>portals that lead to previously<br>inaccessible and initially perhaps<br>Troublesome ways of thinking about<br>something so threshold concepts are<br>often associated with Troublesome<br>knowledge something that's difficult to<br>learn and can often be a barrier to<br>progressing they are irreversible so<br>once learned they're unlikely to be<br>forgotten and indeed because they are<br>transformational the subject or concept<br>is seen in a different way they're also<br>integrative exposing the previously<br>hidden interrelatedness of<br>something the argument is that lecturers<br>should be focusing on these threshold<br>Concepts within their teaching as<br>students cannot progress their<br>understanding without them I suspect<br>that intuitively good teachers would<br>know what these are and pay particular<br>attention to them in the<br>curriculum for example in my own<br>teaching of second year climatology when<br>I again I initially tried to teach the<br>lot I was covering as much as possible<br>about weather and<br>microclimates however I noted that<br>students were not getting what I thought<br>of as the key Concepts and realize now<br>the educationalist just called them a<br>fancy name threshold<br>concepts for my students understanding<br>radiation and energy balances and how<br>these linked to microclimates was<br>essential once I made this realization I<br>then Focus my entire course on teaching<br>towards those<br>Concepts since my land seminal work<br>there's been a lot of research across<br>the world and widespread interests by<br>academics I suggest that you Google<br>threshold concepts for your discipline<br>and see how you're paying attention to<br>teaching as well as disciplinary<br>knowledge students need to develop<br>disciplinary specific skills and<br>attributes you will know what these are<br>in your discipline for geography some of<br>the core skills are given here<br>cartography Global geographical<br>imagination which is understanding the<br>world in a spatial inherently spatial<br>way and ethical thinking where graduates<br>have a sense of agency and moral<br>citizenship that is moral development<br>and responsibility towards society and<br>this should Encompass Notions of<br>sustainability but not just knowing<br>about them but acting in a sustainable<br>way as WTI say we need to nurture<br>engaged active independent and humble<br>students students who can reflect on<br>their own practices understand the<br>influence of these on wider social<br>networks and recognize the limits of<br>their knowledge and<br>understanding hopefully the atago staff<br>here will recognize this<br>profile as well as discipline specific<br>skills atago has identified a profile<br>with 13 attributes shown<br>here hopefully for your degree programs<br>and for your disciplines you will have<br>customized this profile to make it<br>contextually relevant for your<br>students which of these can be confident<br>can you be confident students will have<br>graduation this graph kindly supplied by<br>Romaine morosa is hot off the press from<br>preliminary analysis of the 2013<br>graduate opinion<br>survey in this survey questions were<br>asked about the extent to which the<br>degree programs encourag the development<br>of graduate attributes during the course<br>of<br>study as well as application of the<br>attribute and post University<br>experiences the surveys conducted 18<br>months after<br>graduation a positive number means there<br>was encouragement of this<br>attribute right we can see that overall<br>if we're looking at the application and<br>development there's actually not too bad<br>a match I was quite encouraged to see<br>this but there are some areas in which<br>we can do better most not noticeably<br>these are teamwork and oral<br>communication skills but also planning<br>solving problems self-confidence<br>independent judgment being creative and<br>flexibility and<br>adaptability these are all qualities<br>which we know are important for students<br>to cope with uncertain Futures and<br>portfolio careers so there's a lesson<br>here for us in our<br>curriculum so how can we teach to<br>develop the desirable range of knowledge<br>values since the year 2000 data has been<br>collected from over 1.4 million students<br>at 1200 higher education institutions in<br>the US with the national survey of<br>student engagement or nessi as it's<br>known in 2008 George coup one of the<br>creators and proponents of nessi used<br>nine years of data to established 10<br>high impact educational practices so<br>this is what the students valued as<br>being particularly important in their<br>learning their sample included liberal<br>arts colleges as well as universities so<br>some of the practices might actually be<br>a bit hard to implement in a large<br>University like<br>this these high impact educational<br>practices as well as getting students<br>more engaged in their learning are known<br>to help Foster a range of graduate<br>attributes and as you look at that oh<br>sorry I haven't put it<br>up as you look at that list how many of<br>my particular interest is an<br>undergraduate research which I expand to<br>include learning through inquiry such<br>experience has come through strongly in<br>our Targo Millennium graduate study and<br>I'm going to discuss this in more<br>detail most of my research and higher<br>education has been on undergraduate<br>research inquiry and this 2010 paper<br>which stemmed from a national project on<br>inquiry based learning we developed the<br>theoretical basis for learning through<br>inquiry first we provideed a definition<br>is shown here the elements included<br>learning being um driven by questions or<br>problems learning based on a process of<br>seeking new knowledge and understanding<br>a student centered approach with the<br>teacher as facilitator a move to<br>self-directed learning and an active<br>approach to<br>learning here is a model of the inquiry<br>process from Justice and we can see here<br>it starts with identification of basic<br>knowledge um and the topic that's of<br>Interest generating in question<br>identifying<br>resources um assessing the information<br>weighing up the evidence communicating<br>new understandings and evaluating<br>success and that usually generates more<br>problems for inquiry and Central to this<br>is this notion of self-reflection and<br>self- evaluation inquiry based learning<br>can include the whole cycle or it might<br>just be part of it in our research we<br>came up with three important qualifiers<br>firstly scale within class is where you<br>might use questions for example to<br>stimulate inquiry within the course<br>might be Project work or<br>assignments at the level of the course<br>it's the design principle for the whole<br>course or it could be the design<br>principle for the whole degree such as<br>with the ecology degree here at atago<br>it's a scale of inquiry increases the<br>benefits to students increase so we<br>should be aiming to design whole courses<br>or whole degree programs to take an<br>inquiry<br>approach with framing using Levy<br>definitions we used information oriented<br>which is where students sought answers<br>that were already existing so teachers<br>knew the answers but they were just new<br>to the students or Discovery oriented<br>where knowledge was not known so the<br>inquiry was producing original new<br>insights and then we looked at modes and<br>there were three modes structured which<br>is where the lecturers provide an issue<br>or problem for students to address as<br>well as an outline for addressing it<br>guided where lecturers provide the<br>questions to stimulate inquiry but<br>students are self-directed in terms of<br>answering those questions or open where<br>students formulate the question and go<br>themselves to make this a bit more<br>concrete I want you to consider three<br>courses from atago that we studied in a<br>national project each course used an<br>inquiry design first a stage three<br>Endocrinology course developed by Peter<br>Schwarz it used a case-based learning<br>approach the class of 230 was split into<br>16 groups of about 14 students each<br>group met once a week with their tutor<br>students had to prepare for those<br>sessions and then in the group session<br>there would be a lot of brainstorming<br>and discussion around scenarios the<br>inquiry questions were open-ended and<br>had multiple possible answers but the<br>tutors wereth seeking one right answer<br>it's probably a good thing when you<br>think about what they're<br>doing the second one was political<br>communication taught by Chris rud it<br>used a guided inquiry approach students<br>covered a series of topics but they were<br>framed through a series of questions<br>they had to prepare for weekly group<br>meetings by accessing online resources<br>and undertaking reading as well as<br>listening and watching media Clips<br>having done the Preparatory material the<br>group discussions and the class focused<br>on key questions and the teacher used a<br>series of brainstorming and task<br>oriented methods to get students to<br>cover broad content areas so this<br>approach is now known as the flipped<br>classroom<br>and then the third course was the<br>ecology field studies course developed<br>by keth Dickinson and colleagues it<br>adopted an open Discovery oriented<br>inquiry approach students developed the<br>research questions and they completed<br>the research projects they did field<br>research over a weekl long field trip<br>and then completed analysis once back on<br>campus the students there had to give an<br>oral presentation and a written report<br>on their research and some third-year<br>students have actually she published<br>journals Rebecca Walker and I have<br>generated a model showing the relation<br>between the level of<br>Independence uh here we have it and the<br>focus of learning and you'll see that<br>the open is Discovery oriented and then<br>the hatched as information oriented this<br>provides useful tool to conceptualize<br>learning through inquiry the model is<br>constructed in deliberately in a stepped<br>Podium fashion to reflect a desire that<br>graduates should attain the highest<br>before<br>graduation one possible pathway is to<br>start at first year with structured<br>inquiry and then at second year to build<br>and guided inquiry and third year open<br>inquiry so that inquiry skills are<br>progressively developed throughout the<br>curriculum and indeed that's what the<br>ecology program does however some<br>researchers argue that actually if you<br>can do it starting with open inquiry is<br>a great way to engage students into res<br>in research and intr ruce them to the<br>research culture of the university and<br>let them know how messy research can be<br>but quite a lot of support is required<br>for that and obviously class size would<br>have to be taken into account if you go<br>that route then the guided inst<br>structured would be would follow that in<br>the next years returning to do more<br>year but why bother promoting<br>undergraduate research and inquiry<br>approaches so this is my busiest slide I<br>think there are many benefits and I had<br>to put them all there as mentioned<br>earlier C's work identified um<br>undergraduate research as being high<br>impact practice highly valued by<br>students moreover increasing evidence<br>shows that there are enhanced learning<br>outcomes through such<br>experiences and here are some of the<br>benefits higher higher order learning<br>outcomes especially critical thinking<br>skills and application of<br>knowledge personal and professional<br>gains such as in confidence and<br>establishing colleg your relationships<br>with lecturers and peers disciplinary<br>ways of thinking and<br>practicing enhanced academic achievement<br>in terms of higher grades and better<br>attention curiosity and a passion for<br>learning a holistic sense of higher<br>education a host of graduate attributes<br>enhance preparation not only for<br>postgraduate study but also for the<br>workplace and Clarity of career<br>Pathways lecturers also report benefits<br>such as enjoyment reward from seeing<br>students grow Recruitment and<br>postgraduate study I know most of my<br>geography postgraduates come through<br>this inquiry route and for some<br>publication<br>outputs so there's now increasing<br>evidence for inquiry based learning to<br>develop higher order learning outcomes<br>but what was not learn was whether the<br>different types of inquiry would lead to<br>different outcomes so in some research a<br>few years ago we looked at 16 inquiry<br>courses across four higher education<br>institutions in New Zealand Tigo<br>Canterbury Victoria and cpit and we<br>surveyed students to find their<br>perception of learning outcomes from<br>these courses this graph shows a range<br>of learning outcomes from memorizing<br>lower order through to um higher order<br>skills of applying evaluating creating<br>and reflecting and then up this side we<br>have percentage responding a great deal<br>or quite a bit and we can see that for<br>most of these there is a progression<br>from structured to guided to open the<br>exception being memorizing which in the<br>structured courses quite a lot of<br>memorizing was required as you might<br>expect it was also Apparent from our<br>study that Discovery oriented that's<br>learning new<br>knowledge uh gave better outcomes too<br>for students so ideally we should be<br>providing open Discovery oriented<br>inquiry courses to our<br>undergraduates now I would just like to<br>share a couple of quotes here and I'll<br>let you read through these this is one<br>from a student in<br>learning and then if we look at ecology<br>so I hope I've given you a glimpse into<br>the many benefits for students of<br>learning through inquiry it's certainly<br>a powerful pedagogy that will help them<br>cope with uncertainty as well as a range<br>of other<br>benefits I'm just going to finish off by<br>talking about some extracurricular<br>experiences and to share with you one of<br>these particular experiences in the last<br>three years I've been leading the ataro<br>connection of the Miki undergraduate<br>research Network or M as it's known many<br>of you will know about the Miki Network<br>it's a partnership with seven<br>universities across the globe and had to<br>have another map of course frustrated<br>that my ARS wouldn't quite go where I<br>wanted them but I think I've got the<br>right countries at<br>least so this um undergraduate research<br>network was a brainchild of the<br>University of Western Australia and then<br>we joined with them last year as well as<br>darham Dar didn't participate this year<br>but Queens in Canada joined in the aims<br>of it were to provide a unique<br>opportunity to connect students engaging<br>in undergraduate research programs from<br>different universities across the<br>network to give them an authentic<br>research experience to develop<br>transferable research skills to provide<br>students with a university and global<br>perspective on teaching and learning to<br>provide an insight into and basic<br>preparation for postgraduate<br>study and to use results to inform<br>policy and practice within the instit<br>utions how did we do it well um teaching<br>and learning was chosen as the research<br>Focus students did get a $3,000 sttip in<br>because it was<br>extracurricular the Project's focused on<br>an aspect of teaching and learning and<br>the last two years it's been<br>internationalization of higher education<br>and the students were trained in higher<br>education research through a series of<br>online modules taught Workshop sessions<br>using web conferencing and local<br>sessions and then they undertake search<br>projects supervised by HDC or equivalent<br>academics and I'll let you have a read<br>through some of those examples of<br>what do our students think of this this<br>is a photo of three of our students this<br>year Matt kilty on um in the T-shirt<br>there um from chemistry Steph bck from<br>anatomy and too mov from lore at the<br>second austral Asian conference on<br>undergraduate research in Sydney where<br>they presented two submitting papers to<br>emerge and an a Miki undergraduate<br>research Journal that we've developed in<br>HC ano has submitted to an austral<br>law education<br>Journal we're going to hear from H hey<br>I'm heish Russell and I'm also part of<br>theago group with this Mo Adventure um<br>I've been researching International<br>Exchange programs and specifically the<br>factors that determine or at least<br>influence where AO students decide to go<br>on Exchange um and that's been<br>interesting for me because hey I went to<br>an exchange last year to Canada um which<br>was awesome and I wanted to find out why<br>people decide to go to other places<br>other than Canada and that's a kind of a<br>neglected area in the literature it<br>seems um in terms of exchange programs a<br>lot of emphasis on why exchange programs<br>are good and whatnot not so much on why<br>students go to specific locations um so<br>yeah kind of I've enjoyed that because<br>it feels like I'm actually contributing<br>to an area that's been less focused on<br>which is pretty cool um another good<br>thing I've got out of this project is<br>experience at research but experience at<br>a particular kind of research um I'm a<br>philosophy student and we'll be doing<br>philosophy postgrad um for the next few<br>years and so this kind of research<br>actually with with this project is<br>actually dealing with data which is<br>something I may not come across again<br>quite so much in my philosophical<br>Endeavors and so it's been a good chance<br>to learn just how different research<br>Works how how I guess social science<br>research Works um and I've been<br>conducting surveys of AO exchange<br>students so kind of like I guess a<br>marketing style survey research um so I<br>guess that's given me a broader grasp of<br>what academics kind of do at<br>universities so that's been interesting<br>um and the top of inter<br>internationalization is also interesting<br>one um which has come across in my<br>studies in a sort of broader sense in<br>terms of like economics and whatnot um<br>so it's been good to focus on a sort of<br>nitty-gritty aspect of that I guess in<br>the context of what I've participated<br>and enjoyed with exchange programs um<br>the actual International aspect of the<br>group that we've been doing um<br>coordinating with un universities to be<br>honest I found I guess less useful than<br>it could be um to speak to speak frankly<br>I guess it's it's because the because<br>the local group has been so useful and<br>so supportive the their access to the<br>International Group I I guess seem kind<br>of redundant is probably the biggest<br>thing there seems to be no more we can<br>gain from that than actually talking to<br>people face to face at otago so I guess<br>it's not that there's no potential for<br>the International Group to be useful but<br>just that most of its needs were met um<br>and also technical difficulties and<br>whatnot Technology's got to get kind of<br>up there um so yeah nothing else bring<br>to<br>mind so the students have said that they<br>highly value the local community of<br>researchers and they appreciate skills<br>being developed in research uh they've<br>learned about publish uh process of<br>publishing and also presenting at<br>conferences as heish indicated they did<br>see less value in the international<br>aspect probably because there was no<br>real need to engage I had really wanted<br>to push for collaborative projects<br>across the countries but the leaders who<br>were doing this were a bit resistant to<br>that initially I think that will come in<br>in the next iteration because if there<br>are truly collaborative projects I think<br>the benefits will then be seen<br>nevertheless it's been a very worth<br>process for students for those of us<br>teaching on it and for the institutions<br>where we're in the process of feeding<br>back<br>results finally it's all very well to<br>provide curricular and extracurricular<br>activities to develop a host of<br>discipline specific and generic skills<br>but do our students realize what skills<br>they are getting can they articulate<br>them I think as lecturers we need to<br>assist students to both monitor their<br>progress of attaining graduate<br>attributes and help them articulate<br>these this takes us into the realm of<br>skills audits learning journals<br>reflective critiques and E<br>portfolios I know some colleagues here<br>at ataro and education and The Bachelor<br>of oral health are using e portfolios to<br>assist students to keep track of their<br>development and for their future<br>professional<br>careers in a super complex world we need<br>to prepare graduates to cope with<br>uncertainty and to give them the<br>confidence to be in an uncertain world<br>so how can we educate undergraduates for<br>uncertain Futures we need to provide<br>them with curricular and extracurricular<br>experiences that help develop<br>disciplinary knowledge skills and<br>attributes as well as generic skills as<br>academics we need to explicitly model<br>and articulate our ways of thinking and<br>practicing learning through inquiry is a<br>high impact educational experience to<br>develop ways of thinking and practicing<br>fostering host of discipline specific<br>engineer skills try to incorporate<br>mainstream in experiences as well as<br>offering summer student ships finally<br>and importantly students must be made<br>aware of what we're trying to do and<br>they should be assisted to track their<br>acquisition of knowledge skills and<br>attributes they need to articulate what<br>it means to think and practice as a<br>geographer or an ecologist or historian<br>Etc by doing so we can help graduates to<br>be in an uncertain<br>good afternoon everybody I'm Tony<br>Harland and I'm the head of the higher<br>education development center and it's uh<br>my pleasure at the end of this lecture<br>to thank Rachel and uh to make a few<br>observations on the uh the her<br>talk I want to start start by saying<br>that HC academics are I think of them as<br>academic migrants we all come from<br>somewhere else there's no undergraduate<br>route in in into what we do so Rachel's<br>careers as you've heard was uh in early<br>career was in<br>geography uh then she became a<br>postgraduate in HC and that's how uh we<br>we met all the all those years ago um so<br>she's moved from Pure science into<br>social science and from a quantitative<br>world into a qualitative<br>world now Rachel was published in higher<br>education uh within a year of coming<br>through into that new<br>world um and she got into the top<br>journals within two years and that was<br>absolutely phenomenal if you think about<br>it there was no apprenticeship um in in<br>apprenticeship so I think what re Rachel<br>had learned to do here um as a a<br>geography scholar here and bring it into<br>a new a completely new radical area if<br>you make that was a scientist too you<br>make that transition it's a very very<br>big transition um but you did it really<br>well and really quickly now the reason<br>I'm telling you this story is<br>because<br>um that's what Rachel researches now she<br>has lived that journey and she's uh<br>living embodiment if you like of her own<br>ideal of a university uh<br>education educate students as<br>inquirers um educate them as researchers<br>and they will have genuinely<br>transferable skills that they can bring<br>into all sorts of Uncertain Futures<br>whether or not they're known or<br>unknown so to research these Concepts I<br>think uh is important<br>both to contribute to Educational Theory<br>which Rachel does um extremely well um<br>and is leading in uh certain areas<br>around the world in Educational Theory<br>um but it also helps us everybody in<br>this room um in our practice as<br>University teachers I think for all of<br>us to meet the requirements of the<br>University of ATO graduate um The<br>Graduate research profile The Graduate<br>attributes if you like um is complex and<br>challenging it raises many many<br>questions and these are the things uh<br>Rachel is interested in I mean how do we<br>teach all students the full range of<br>graduate<br>attributes um are graduate attributes<br>optional for some academics Vernon and I<br>have talked about this a little bit are<br>they optional for some academics or some<br>disciplines is the list presenting us<br>here um with direction that we must<br>take I was uh I was flying back<br>yesterday uh from Malaysia and I was<br>reading a novel a historical novel about<br>uh Malta in the siege of Malta during<br>the second world war and I'm going to<br>read out a little quote I know I should<br>have been writing a paper on the plane<br>um or marking students work but I was<br>reading a novel but there was a really<br>neat quote in the uh in this and I<br>googled it today so I'm going to share<br>it with you and I think it relates to uh<br>the work that uh Rachel is doing really<br>well rules are made for The Obedience of<br>Fools and the guidance of wise<br>men and I thought that was really<br>interesting firstly because I didn't<br>know who'd said the quote and secondly<br>and I thought will will I share it today<br>with everybody with all these Wise Women<br>in the<br>room um it was written a long time ago I<br>actually thought it was written by some<br>philosopher a long time ago but it was<br>written by Douglas badar and uh Douglas<br>badar uh he was the World War II flying<br>Ace um and he said that in the 1930s<br>when he was Breaking All the Rules of uh<br>flying but of course Douglas badar<br>crashed and lost both his legs and uh so<br>maybe breaking the rules maybe we should<br>follow the graduate attributes and it's<br>a lot easier to do that um but it brings<br>into question what is expected and it's<br>hard for a lot of us to know this um<br>what is expected of a university teacher<br>and what are the limits of the teacher's<br>responsibility and I think they're the<br>sorts of questions that Rachel is<br>actually concerned about because it<br>calls into question the whole purposes<br>education so I'd just like to conclude<br>by saying that uh Rachel's work has made<br>a major<br>contribution um both to Theory both to<br>the field and it can guide us um<br>and in our decisions in what we're asked<br>to do and what we feel uh we have to do<br>so thank you very much Rachel and we've<br>got a small gift for you from the<br>University</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
