Through the beat of a drum, Raenette has brought many children out of their shells and encouraged them to reach for the stars. Her inspirational and moving stories are endless.<br><br>www.topoftheclass.ac.nz</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi I'm R talard I've been teaching for<br>26 years and I teach at Elm Park Primary<br>in panga teaching a year sixth class but<br>I get to teach music on Fridays and very<br>often there are children with complex<br>needs in my music groups I think the<br>thing that makes me the most excited is<br>when I get little children in front of<br>me or to work with that maybe have<br>struggled with behavior or have<br>challenges and as I work with them I can<br>actually see them develop and grow and<br>settle into a rhythm and um that really<br>excites me I really like seeing children<br>develop and come into their own and it's<br>nice to see children that are challenged<br>or have issues and as I work with them<br>and as music starts being a part of The<br>Learning Experience they relax and they<br>start to learn<br>self-management sometimes children are<br>really reluctant to work with you and as<br>you get something which they can hook<br>into which in my case it's often music<br>they relax and they start realizing that<br>there's a part of them that can listen<br>to instructions and stay on the beat and<br>work with other people I really enjoy<br>encouraging children that might have<br>challenges or complex needs and seeing<br>them develop and grow as the year goes<br>along every child that comes on my way<br>is unique and exciting and different and<br>often a bit quirky and I really care for<br>the children I want them to be happy and<br>I want them to develop and little<br>successes breed more successes so when a<br>child's doing well of course I try a bit<br>harder with the next one that can be a<br>variety of issues that children have or<br>struggles that they have with learning<br>that could include things like asures or<br>Autism or it could be hearing problems<br>um sight problems sometimes children are<br>just struggle with social interaction<br>and I just happen to have affinity for<br>these children and because I teach music<br>it's a really good vehicle to work with<br>these children Dayton is one of the boys<br>I work with and Dayton has asperges<br>syndrome which is on the autism spectrum<br>last year I had him in drum meat and the<br>year before I had him as well he was<br>reticent he was sulky he was very afraid<br>of making a mistake he was looking at<br>the ground not trying to drum at all and<br>by the second or the third lesson he<br>started participating because he's much<br>more confident in himself he knows how<br>to cope if his emotions start to<br>overrule him and I think the drumming<br>and the music is what has led to that<br>the children inspire me because they're<br>so honest and straightforward they're<br>colorful and they're interesting and<br>they have no boundaries they've got no<br>idea of what you can and can't do to<br>them everything is possible it's<br>probably the hardest toughest job<br>emotionally but also the most rewarding<br>job emotionally you go to bed every<br>night and you know you've made a<br>difference to someone I love the variety<br>of it all the unexpected element there's<br>something new every day there's<br>something you weren't expecting every<br>day</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
