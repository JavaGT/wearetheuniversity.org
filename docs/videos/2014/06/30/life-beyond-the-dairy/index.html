font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Tony kosi I'm the principal<br>at Mund South School and I've been<br>teaching for about 20 years I came from<br>a a large Pacific family I look at these<br>children I see myself in the eyes of a<br>lot of the students that come here I<br>wasn't privy to a lot of experiences one<br>of the things I try and do here at the<br>school is is um allow those children to<br>have those experiences things like you<br>know I just make assumptions that all<br>children have been to the beach and all<br>children have been to the zoo and um we<br>notice within our own school there are<br>plenty of children that don't even um go<br>along the um the the northern Motorway<br>and why would they because a lot of them<br>just live within their community so we<br>kind of have this saying at school that<br>there's life beyond the dairy so we have<br>a dairy on the corner just up the road<br>for us and allow that learning to happen<br>so it's just sort of providing them with<br>different opportunities things that they<br>sometimes not necessarily be able to do<br>um cost as a factor as well it's kind of<br>having the light switch go on for a lot<br>of those children it's for them to know<br>that um within their Community there are<br>lots of things that we could do there<br>and it's really important but there's<br>also a wider Community for them to go<br>out and explore so one experience I can<br>think of that I believe that children<br>really really got a lot out of was we<br>were doing a unit around space and the<br>opportunity of for students to go to the<br>observatory when we got to the The<br>Observatory itself and um walking into<br>the observatory and the the looks on<br>their faces like you know wow you know<br>where're you know this is you know the<br>excitement really that's what it was it<br>was the excitement of going to learn<br>something new but later on in life when<br>you see your students that you've taught<br>and they've come up to you and they've<br>said to you sir I remember when we did<br>did this and I remember when we did that<br>I think that's their way of saying thank<br>you to you I really like that as well<br>you know that when I've had<br>opportunities of seeing um ex- students<br>of mine and who have gone on to do some<br>great things and I think well um I've<br>sort of helped them get there as well so<br>I think that's really really important<br>that um you know I I was part of their<br>Journey as well you think gosh you know<br>you've been part of of what's happened<br>in their lives I often ask myself why<br>wouldn't I want want to be a teacher<br>when you see children grow and the<br>learning that happens I love the<br>teaching profession you know what other<br>profession allows you to change lives<br>nurture and and grow great leaders that<br>we'll have in the future</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
