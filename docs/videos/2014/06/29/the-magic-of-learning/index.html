Why? To follow his passion to teach young children. <br><br>He is now a teacher at Mangere Bridge Kindergarten, part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association, and is deeply enthusiastic about challenging children's ideas and how they think the world works. <br><br>www.topoftheclass.ac.nz</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm Daniel lit I've been working in<br>early childhood for about four years now<br>I work in my local community down at<br>mangry Bridge kindergarten I was<br>interested in early childhood education<br>when I was a teenager I think I I really<br>loved being with young children with<br>four-year-old and three-year-old<br>children and as I got older I started<br>working as an electrician and I moved<br>into electrical engineering and I forgot<br>that my passion in life was three and<br>4-year-old children there's a number of<br>things that excite me about Early<br>Childhood the children themselves of<br>course the the creativity that they<br>bring the amazing things that they say<br>the fact that they haven't been pushed<br>into a box at the moment they're still<br>thinking widely and creatively they they<br>come up with amazing things they teach<br>me a lot about how I should live my life<br>just as I teach them a lot about their<br>life too yeah I think children haven't<br>had their thinking placed into a box yet<br>when they're at the age of three and<br>four so we don't sit a child down and<br>say that today you're going to learn<br>such and such we take a child's interest<br>and then we run with that and we<br>incorporate learning into that children<br>actually love to have their ideas<br>challenged I think that they thrive on<br>that idea of thinking the way that they<br>perceive things in their own eyes might<br>not be the way that I see them so when<br>we play the guitar when I play the<br>guitar in a child's inside me playing<br>the ukulele it probably actually sounds<br>quite horrendous to a nearby adult but<br>to the ears of the child it's sounding<br>wonderful and they're experiencing<br>something really meaningful to them<br>they're making music moments like those<br>make me think that my teaching is<br>actually making a difference in<br>children's Liv we have a a curriculum<br>which starts with an aspiration<br>statement saying that we want our<br>children to grow up to be healthy in<br>mind body and spirit to be competent and<br>capable and to know that they are going<br>to grow into a role where they<br>contribute in a valued way to society<br>and that's a huge onus on us as teachers<br>but actually it's it's a wonderful thing<br>to look at when we view our children<br>that means that we get<br>opportunities every day to work with<br>children to help them to see that they<br>have a place in the world that they have<br>a place in the kindergarten where we are<br>a place in their family and we work<br>together with them to um to help them to<br>develop that every day is different in<br>early childhood and you never get bored<br>there are amazing things that happen<br>with our children as you watch them<br>develop as you watch them try things<br>that at first they can't do and they<br>really struggle with and then as they<br>persevere and other children help and we<br>might help as teachers and you see that<br>sense of accomplishment as they find<br>that they actually are able to do it<br>we're changing children's lives</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
