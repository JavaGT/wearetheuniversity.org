Now, she is using his unique teaching style to pay it forward for her own students.<br><br>www.topoftheclass.ac.nz</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Ronnie Prasad I've been a<br>teacher for years and I teach a puppy<br>territory high school I teach<br>mathematics and I've recently been<br>appointed as assistant head of<br>mathematics there was no connections<br>back at school so when I came to New<br>Zealand I was and I was at the school<br>and I had a really good teacher Kevin<br>and he sort of guided me along the way<br>I'm from Fiji originally moved here when<br>I was 16 so did my 6th and 7th for more<br>year 12 and 13 over here and Gavin was a<br>teacher at this school he was my year 13<br>stats teacher the things I've learned<br>from him it's just been great it was<br>just the way he taught things just made<br>more scenes things were just simpler<br>it's more practical so the kids get more<br>engaged with the work you do with them<br>instead of sitting there and working<br>from a book let's just go outside and do<br>a little walk around and see what you<br>get out of it relating it to math<br>obviously picking up on his teaching<br>style in terms of making it more<br>practical making sure that you related<br>also to something you know in interest<br>of the child Kevin is overseas at the<br>moment we keep in touch and he's he's<br>there as my mentor so I mean if I need<br>help he's there to help me and guide me<br>through any of the little situations<br>that I might come across you know I know<br>that I've got that support and if I need<br>anything I can count on them to help me<br>with it and that's what i figured out<br>from Gavin started teaching that if you<br>want kids to learn you got to make<br>connections and the best way to make<br>connection is to get to know your<br>student once you know them then<br>everything's a walk in the path last<br>year when I had on my your teens there<br>was a student in their class there was<br>really motivated however he wasn't sure<br>where he was going to go with it so I<br>was like well why don't you do liver one<br>because he was bright but he just needed<br>the coaching so I told him look don't<br>worry come and see me outside of classes<br>I'll help you and I'll coach you through<br>it he did the exams his results came in<br>he came in to see me and said wow must<br>I'm going to be in level two so he<br>skipped an entire grade so you know that<br>gives<br>little sense of achievement like he's<br>have helped someone so it's just knowing<br>that you've made that little difference<br>to the class or to a student or to a lot<br>of people might think teaching is<br>pouring but it's fun you get to see kids<br>to get to have them for a year you get<br>to part of give them a little bit of<br>your knowledge that you've got but it's<br>just a feeling that you get into the<br>satisfaction feeling it's I've managed<br>to achieve something today I have an<br>entire year if and one student comes up<br>dientes mess up with really good grades<br>I've been doing so well it's just it ha<br>there you go home satisfied it yep I've</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
