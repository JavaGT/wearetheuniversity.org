The relationships that have been formed are influential and inspiring. <br><br>http://www.topoftheclass.ac.nz</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm caner yardena and I've been teaching<br>for a year and a half now and I'm at St<br>cords College in Auckland I teach<br>secondary school and I'm an English<br>teacher for me it comes down to what<br>learning is to me learning isn't<br>something that happens in the four walls<br>of a classroom or in a school building<br>for me um school is not equal to an<br>education learning and an education are<br>something that are much bigger and much<br>more expansive if we're not having fun<br>it's not learning real learning happens<br>when there's joy and there's playfulness<br>that's where growth happens a huge part<br>of what real learning is historically<br>and now is about bringing together disar<br>parts of a community the young people<br>the adults the elders and having them<br>exchange their different kinds of<br>knowledge their different kinds of<br>wisdom with each other we began with<br>using the year to explore Journeys and<br>discoveries and part of that we looked<br>at a poem by George Ella lions and it's<br>a poem about where I'm<br>from it<br>explores the plethora the range of the<br>kinds of places that we come from<br>Memories the small things we studied the<br>poem The Girls then wrote their own<br>where I'm from poem and then they took<br>those beautiful poems and they made a<br>digital poem I was so moved by what the<br>girls had made I felt that it was<br>dishonoring of their work to just give<br>it a mark give it back to them and send<br>them on their way and we move on to the<br>next unit and I said to them your work<br>is stunning who can we share it with and<br>I said to them there's a home across the<br>street for elders maybe we could go over<br>there and share it there and as soon as<br>I said the Knox home an Eld ERS and<br>share their poetry there the girls just<br>got so excited going over to the Knox<br>home was really special for the girls I<br>think they showed six or seven of their<br>videos their digital poems that day and<br>then at the end the girls had a chance<br>to go and connect with the residents<br>Elders offer so much wisdom they offer a<br>chance for young people how to<br>contribute to our communities the elders<br>taught us a lot L I think the impact<br>that the young women I worked with had<br>on the home on the Knox home on its<br>residence was to show them that there<br>are young people around us who care but<br>it wasn't a one-way contribution it was<br>about what the young people and the<br>elders did together one of the really<br>powerful things that emerged from the<br>girls work was how much joy comes from<br>spending time with the elders in their<br>Community a lot of what I hope to do in<br>our learning community<br>under the mantle of English teaching is<br>to help us continue to ask the big<br>questions of our time to ask questions<br>about our values about what is important<br>to us as<br>people</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
