you<br>made it in here you've passed through<br>the outstanding security that has been<br>provided for this evening's event and as<br>we were discussing in the dressing room<br>this is the first time that people have<br>been searched before coming to an IPL<br>but I suspect that Richard students<br>would be happy to rent themselves out if<br>people feel that they need to have the<br>security service at future public<br>presentations we're all gathered here to<br>celebrate with Richard Jackson and his<br>appointment here at the University of<br>Otago as a professor he's actually been<br>here for quite some time and feels a bit<br>like an old friend but it's fantastic to<br>have the chance to actually listen to<br>him speak to a group of not only staff<br>and students but members of the general<br>public as well i would like to warmly<br>welcome a couple of special guests this<br>evening first I understand that Richards<br>parents are here from Christchurch so we<br>would like to warmly welcome them<br>they're from and and his friends are<br>here are his friends here from<br>Christchurch as well all right there we<br>go so and I think this indicates that a<br>lot of people in the audience understand<br>what an important event it is to be<br>appointed as a professor here at the<br>University of Otago and it's something<br>that those of us in the administration<br>and other academic staff realize is a<br>huge achievement so welcome Richard even<br>though it's a little bit late I think<br>we've probably welcomed you multiple<br>times but we certainly look forward to<br>hearing your presentation today the<br>other thing I want to comment on is that<br>i would like to also welcome the members<br>of the trust that supports the peace and<br>Conflict Studies so it turns out that<br>we've been fortunate enough to organize<br>a trust meeting for today so members of<br>the Attero and New Zealand peace and<br>Conflict Studies Center trust members<br>many of them are in the audience this<br>evening and can I just see a show of<br>hands of the trust members who are here<br>and the university is extraordinarily<br>grateful to your hard work and generous<br>donations that have made not only<br>Richards position a possibility but the<br>center as well the final thing that I<br>want to say is often times when I<br>introduce these lectures<br>I remind people that at the University<br>of Otago seventy percent of our academic<br>staff are either foreign-born or have<br>received their highest degree from an<br>overseas institution and I think people<br>are starting to actually think that we<br>don't have any new zealand trained<br>academics here at the University of<br>Otago in Richard we have a foreign born<br>but New Zealand educated professor here<br>so Richard was born in Africa but he did<br>do all of his training at the University<br>of Canterbury and we are incredibly<br>pleased that he decided after spending<br>some time in the UK to make his<br>permanent academic home here at the<br>University of Otago so Richard I warmly<br>congratulate you and I would like to<br>welcome professor kevin Clements who is<br>the foundation director of the center<br>for peace and Conflict Studies to tell<br>us a little bit more about Richards<br>academic journey to professorship Thank<br>You Helene and thank you all for coming<br>to this really important lecture tena<br>koutou tena koutou tena koutou katoa it<br>gives me extraordinary pleasure to<br>introduce Richard Jackson to all of you<br>as Holland said he was born in Zambia on<br>the nights of februari 1967 so as he<br>said to me he's a whippersnapper to<br>salvation army missionary parents he<br>lived the first 17 years of his life in<br>Africa which I think has given him his<br>lifelong commitment to justice and<br>equality he returned to New Zealand in<br>the mid-1980s and rediscovered the New<br>Zealand part of us Anglo New Zealand<br>African identities I taught him for one<br>year at the University of Canterbury and<br>he impressed me then as he impresses me<br>now as a wonderfully cosmopolitan<br>Renaissance man he's a person of<br>forwardable intellect he's also an<br>artist and novelist a rugby fanatic a<br>musician and a keen fly fisherman he's<br>passionately committed to new zealand<br>landscape floor and fauna and<br>simultaneous with all of these passions<br>he got his BA his master of arts and his<br>PhD at Canterbury University it was<br>there that he met and eventually married<br>the love of his life michelle and<br>typical of the man instead of having<br>Michelle take his name he<br>cited take her so added Jackson to Wells<br>he was originally Richard wells and he's<br>now Richard wells Jackson he worked as a<br>research assistant and tutor and<br>Political Studies at Canterbury<br>University and then was appointed a<br>teaching fellow here at the University<br>of Otago and as a newly minted PhD<br>Richard attended all of the teaching<br>courses on offer and became a<br>much-appreciated teacher by offering<br>innovative and inclusive courses he also<br>started as lifetimes career of research<br>and publishing in the top refereed<br>international relations and political<br>science journals sadly when a permanent<br>position came up Richard the local<br>candidate was rejected in favor of an<br>external so he and Michelle were forced<br>to migrate in search of work and founded<br>at the University of Manchester and<br>that's where Richard found his niche in<br>his ranking sword it was Manchester<br>University Press who published his<br>hugely cited writing the war on<br>terrorism language politics and<br>counterterrorism 2005 but it was there<br>also that he kind of spent many long<br>hours I guess much to Michelle chagrin<br>researching and writing and producing<br>all of his other books and papers post<br>22 2001 Richard became very focused on<br>counterterrorism which is why we have a<br>counter-terrorist unit here tonight and<br>single-handedly developed what is really<br>now more or less single-handedly<br>developed what's now known as critical<br>terrorism studies here in a group of<br>like-minded academics founded and riches<br>still the editor of critical studies on<br>terrorism which is a much cited journal<br>in the field and he organized and<br>convened the British International<br>Studies Association critical studies on<br>terrorism working group he developed new<br>theory catalyzed and did cutting-edge<br>empirical research and paid very close<br>attention to the right diverse ways in<br>which counterterrorism processes were<br>creating discourses inimical to freedom<br>and democracy Manchester University<br>rewarded their rising star by promoting<br>him rapidly to the position of senior<br>lecturer from which he was recruited mum<br>some would say poached to join Britain's<br>strongest I our department at the<br>University have risked within wales as a<br>senior lecturer and then as a as a<br>reader and it was there that he received<br>his first personal chair in this new<br>context Richard distinguish himself by<br>again by the quality of his teaching his<br>care of students suburbs of supervision<br>and by a constant outpouring of much<br>cited articles and books he's the author<br>and editor of eight books and more than<br>50 journal articles and book chapters<br>and he also found time to become the<br>honorary secretary of the British<br>International Studies Association<br>fortunately for us here at the<br>University of Otago academic laurels<br>professional associations and<br>professorial recognition can't<br>completely assuage the thirst of kiwis<br>yearning to return home New Zealand's<br>mountains and rivers lakes and valleys<br>high country although sea and sand<br>always tag away at expat Kiwis abroad<br>especially when winter hits and they<br>shorten the cold Atlantic storms start<br>settling in so it was for Richard and<br>Michelle having reached an academic<br>pinnacle in the UK and he could have<br>stayed there in perpetuity their<br>thoughts returned to home and this was a<br>moment when a private philanthropist<br>gave the sin of some funds to hunt to<br>have to fund a deputy director Richard<br>applied for this position was selected<br>from an extraordinarily strong field we<br>couldn't have selected a better person<br>and of course when we got Richard we got<br>two for the price of one Richard and<br>Michelle are a wonderful synergistic<br>team and support each other and their<br>chosen fields of excellence both have<br>shared their many talents with the<br>center at the university in way dunedin<br>michelle's making a major contribution<br>to the local choral music scene and<br>Richards Bortas enthusiasm for teaching<br>research and practice into the life and<br>work of the centre he's already received<br>top evaluations for his teaching and<br>supervision and he continues to write<br>very politically his latest work<br>confessions of a terrorist is a novel to<br>be published by Z books next year which<br>was aimed and this novel is aimed at<br>humanizing popular negative stereotypes<br>of terrorists as a colleague Richards<br>exemplary he's an excellent team player<br>and a collaborative problem solver he<br>brings humor and enthusiasm rollers work<br>his is a life that is equally committed<br>to scholarship and transformation<br>and he brings passionate intensity to<br>both he writes academic articles popular<br>blogs and op-ed pieces but he still<br>found time to launch a center film club<br>a regular weekly critical reading group<br>and an annual debate between students<br>and the masses of International Studies<br>and the National Center for peace and<br>Conflict Studies he brings his guitar<br>and seat music to student and center<br>potlucks and parties most recently have<br>arrived as the confessions he's happy<br>for me to make he's come out in a very<br>different way having goddess break in<br>the world of international relations<br>he's made a powerful transition as a<br>Peace Research and from downplaying<br>maybe even hiding his own personal<br>pacifism when working with I are<br>colleagues so he could discourse with<br>them and be taken seriously he's now<br>able to reveal the fact that he is a<br>pacifist and then in wolf's clothing I<br>can think of no more honorable academic<br>calling for richer than the rest of us<br>in the center than seeking to develop a<br>solid philosophical theoretical and<br>empirical justification for critical<br>21st century pacifism riches now<br>directing his formidable intelligence<br>and wisdom to this task so it gives me<br>great pleasure therefore on behalf of<br>the center and the University to<br>introduce professor richard jackson of<br>the National Center for peace and<br>Conflict Studies who will talk to us<br>about the centrality of story and<br>narrative in the construction of social<br>economic and political reality ladies<br>true hey Maury hora kiraku nui a

a<br>wonderful and inspiring leader of this<br>university and I consider it a real<br>privilege to work for her i'm also very<br>grateful that she and the university<br>have made peace and complex that he's a<br>strategic priority and given at genuine<br>institutional support thank you Kevin<br>for your kind words of introduction I<br>actually met Kevin many years ago 25<br>years ago I realized when I took a<br>second year sociology course at the<br>University of Canterbury not only did<br>his approach to issues of global justice<br>and peace greatly inspire me then and<br>and they continue to inspire me today<br>but he also encouraged his students in<br>his class to take a creative approach to<br>assessment saying that we didn't<br>necessarily have to write a final essay<br>so I was something of a novice painter<br>at the time and asked to be allowed to<br>paint a series of themed pictures with<br>accompanying text as my final assignment<br>Kevin agreed and these are a couple of<br>examples that I came up with it was the<br>best assignment I ever had in my<br>undergraduate degree and I feel very<br>proud to be working with Kevin<br>today it feels like a kind of<br>intellectual and and ethical homecoming<br>to be working with Kevin at the center<br>however before I go any further I want<br>to acknowledge two people who are<br>noticeable for their absence tonight<br>first of all my niece Alina wells<br>tragically passed away earlier this year<br>she was planning to go to university and<br>I would have loved it if she could have<br>been here to see this and second<br>professor Jacob berkovich who sadly<br>passed away in 2011 after a battle with<br>cancer that's the book that we one of<br>the books that we did together he was my<br>undergraduate lecturer then my PhD<br>supervisor he employed me as as research<br>assistant for many years and then later<br>he was a colleague and we published two<br>books and an article together he was a<br>world-renowned expert in international<br>mediation a great classroom teacher and<br>he taught me a great deal about how to<br>be a scholar he helped me in so many<br>ways and I know that he would have been<br>very proud to be here and I wish he<br>could have seen it I'm very thankful for<br>all of you who came today especially my<br>friends and family who've come from<br>other parts of the country my best<br>friend's the Allens are here thanks for<br>coming and many from around the<br>University and the wider community I'm<br>deeply humbled to see so many of you<br>here and I can tell that it means a<br>great deal and i can tell you that it<br>means a great deal to me sorry that<br>you're here michelle reminded me the<br>other day that no matter how hard i<br>personally work to get here there are so<br>many people who helped me along the way<br>who inspired me encouraged me when I<br>felt low wrote me references employed me<br>published me taught me things and to<br>whom I owe real debt of gratitude there<br>are far too many stories to recount here<br>such as how Mary hey whose family are<br>here as well a childhood friend from<br>Africa took me to her first her first<br>year lecture and political science at<br>the University of Canterbury it was such<br>a great lecture that I immediately<br>dropped my economics paper<br>and change to political science and that<br>that moment changed my life because I<br>thank you you know I I went on to major<br>in political science and eventually did<br>a PhD in it so others have influenced me<br>in in similar ways too many to recount<br>and I'm I'm sorry if you're in the<br>audience and I forget to thank you<br>however there's a number of people I<br>really want to thank and acknowledge and<br>first of all my parents the reverend's<br>David and Catherine wells who've<br>traveled down from Wellington to be here<br>I'm so happy they could share this<br>occasion with me they not only<br>encouraged me to read as much as I could<br>but they modeled to me how important it<br>was to study hard and learn about any<br>problem or issue you wanted to<br>understand my scholarly instincts and my<br>love of research and reading came<br>directly from their example and I've<br>also always felt their love and<br>encouragement and pride in my<br>achievements which has been crucial to<br>my success and I'm very grateful to have<br>had such wonderful parents secondly I'm<br>so thankful to my wife and soulmate<br>michelle jackson she's had to put up<br>with a workaholic husband for many years<br>and has been a conference widow too many<br>times to remember but throughout our<br>marriage she has shown grace and<br>generosity more importantly she's given<br>me constant encouragement and confidence<br>to try harder and reach higher she's<br>also helped me directly by editing all<br>my books suggesting ideas for lectures<br>and speeches and with my latest project<br>my novel reviewing the manuscript and<br>suggesting improvements the truth is I<br>would not be here without her love and<br>support I'm very lucky to have her in my<br>life<br>third I'm thankful to the wonderful<br>staff and students at the National<br>Center for piece of conflict studies<br>who've welcomed me and accepted me with<br>open arms every single day I feel that<br>they're my greatest supporters I<br>absolutely love working with such an<br>amazing and exceptional group of staff<br>and students I've learned so much from<br>them and they've inspired me with their<br>hard work their keen intellect and their<br>insight the commitment to peace and<br>their dedication to making the world a<br>better place they are like a real family<br>and I know that we're going to go on to<br>achieve great things together I also<br>want to acknowledge and thank the<br>politics department at the university of<br>otago they actually gave me my first<br>academic job which laid the foundation<br>for my future career in particular Jim<br>Flynn who I'm happy to see here and I<br>know Roberts here and and Chris road<br>gave me a great deal of advice and<br>mentoring which was crucial to my later<br>success coming back to work here in a<br>sense feels like coming home to me and<br>I'd also like to thank all the amazing<br>people I met and work with in the UK<br>from 2003 22 2012 I worked with some<br>very fine people at the University of<br>Manchester and Aberystwyth University<br>these are just a few of the great people<br>I'll never forget for example professor<br>Rawdon Wilkinson who just one time when<br>we were talking in the corridor and he I<br>was complaining about how the current<br>Orthodox terrorism journals just didn't<br>seem to you know engage with the issues<br>in the way in a critical way that I<br>thought they should and he said well why<br>don't you just start your own journal<br>and those words changed my life because<br>I thought well why not and I didn't<br>realize that there were obstacles to<br>that but I just went ahead and did it<br>and and and the rest is history so I<br>feel privileged to have worked with<br>these people some of these former<br>students as well have gone on to have<br>great careers themselves and then sex I<br>just when I acknowledge the wonderful<br>colleagues past<br>and present who've helped me start and<br>have been editors with me as kevin says<br>on the journal critical studies on<br>terrorism it's a real challenge to start<br>an academic journal and even more so to<br>keep it going and make successful but<br>these scholars people like professor<br>Murray Breen Smith and ruin gunning and<br>George Casey Mears and Ruth Blakely<br>amongst others have really worked with<br>me tirelessly and professionally to make<br>this journal successful and then finally<br>I just want to mention in my journey to<br>being what George casa Mira's who is a<br>great mate of mine he kind of rudely<br>calls me the founding father of critical<br>terrorism studies in becoming that I<br>want to emphasize the influence of<br>professor Josie basilica and professor<br>ken boothe I actually picked up a copy<br>of Josie bazoo like as Tara and taboo<br>the day before nine eleven and then I<br>read it very closely over the following<br>weeks it was a defining intellectual<br>moment and shaped my entire approach to<br>the study of terrorism later Josie but<br>became a colleague a member of the<br>Journal editorial board a contributor<br>and a friend a few years ago he asked me<br>to write an endorsement of one of his<br>books which I was very proud to do<br>similarly professor ken boothe is a<br>giant in the field and it was my<br>privilege to work with him at<br>Aberystwyth University and his approach<br>to critical security studies was a<br>revelation to me and it formed the<br>foundation in many ways for critical<br>terrorism studies and he's also an<br>editorial board member contributor and<br>has written an endorsement of one of my<br>books so if you want to understand<br>anything about terrorism and security I<br>recommend you read these two books all<br>these wonderful people and many more<br>besides have made me a better scholar<br>and a better person and I owe them all<br>the debt of gratitude they may not fully<br>appreciate the impact they had on me but<br>I know and it reminds me that we should<br>never run domestic estimate the positive<br>impact we can have on one another a<br>simple word of encouragement or a<br>thoughtful suggestion<br>can alter someone's life ladies and<br>gentlemen please stop thinking just<br>listen you are not here to learn if you<br>think critically you are only helping<br>the terrorists all forms of terrorism<br>have been removed I repeat there are no<br>bombs in this lecture theatre do not be<br>afraid stop thinking about the bombs and<br>the terrorists there is no need to be<br>afraid there are no bombs don't think<br>about the bombs there really is advice<br>to live by I feel when I think about my<br>research over the past two decades or so<br>I realize that the most important theme<br>or thread which has come to define my<br>work as the analysis of discourse that<br>is the language and text that we use to<br>communicate make sense of the world and<br>enable and constrain the social actions<br>and practices which constitute our<br>society in our world in particular I've<br>been interested in the nature and role<br>of narratives or stories in the way that<br>we understand and construct the world<br>particularly in relation to politics war<br>and counterterrorism so what is<br>narrative there are a great many<br>definitions in the literature and and<br>simply narrative might be described as<br>the way we construct narrow disparate<br>facts and weave them together<br>cognitively to make sense of reality in<br>this lecture I take narrative to mean<br>the way in which we assemble events<br>facts happenings and characters and give<br>them a particular interpretation through<br>some kind of sequential employment in<br>order to make sense of them and<br>construct collective meanings narratives<br>are all around us and we can observe a<br>can be observed in obviously in textual<br>forms such as novels films comics<br>newspapers journals and so on but also<br>more broadly in common forms of language<br>myths legends parables jokes cultural<br>repertoires metaphors popular sayings<br>you know like catch-22 or crying wolf<br>words that we use in our daily<br>conversation<br>they can also be seen in symbols flags<br>seals emblems social practices rituals<br>such as a professorial lecture where we<br>get to dress up in costumes and enact a<br>story-based ritual material objects<br>monuments carvings museums gavels mesas<br>and so on architecture law and science<br>narratives are all around us so briefly<br>what types of narratives are there in<br>the field of narrative analysis it's<br>become common to identify four main<br>types of narrative so ontological or<br>personal narratives are the stories we<br>need to function as social actors in<br>other words every individual possesses a<br>set of ontological narratives about who<br>they are where they came from and how<br>they are connected to the society they<br>inhabit the reality is that we never<br>stop telling stories telling ourselves<br>stories because it is how we make sense<br>of our place in the world what came<br>before where we are now and where we are<br>headed or to put it another way humans<br>are storytelling organisms who lead<br>storied lives such personal narratives<br>are crucial to the identity of the self<br>and understanding our stories helps us<br>to make sense of our lives and to<br>realize our agency for example my<br>personal story as kevin has mentioned is<br>one of growing up in a rural part of<br>Africa as the son of missionaries during<br>a period of war in neighboring Zimbabwe<br>and then hitchhiking around South Africa<br>in 1984 when it was still an apartheid<br>state these experiences the stories that<br>I heard the stories that I experienced<br>and constructed for myself were deeply<br>effective and my life of research into<br>violence war peace and so on is directly<br>connected to these defining stories<br>there are also public narratives which<br>other stories told by institutions and<br>social formations like states expressed<br>through the teaching of history public<br>speeches and media national rituals<br>memorials novels music theatre<br>and countless other ways they become<br>collective stories shared by large<br>groups the anzacs story of New Zealand<br>and Australia or the story of 911 in the<br>United States for example are both<br>powerful cases of public narratives<br>there are also scientific story<br>narratives these are the stories told by<br>scholars particularly social scientists<br>who organize which organized and shape<br>knowledge and research examples here<br>include theories of social change<br>economic growth path dependency peace<br>war and many others actually there's a<br>long-standing debate within the<br>philosophy of history about the<br>importance of narrative in the<br>production of historical knowledge<br>Hayden White has famously argued that<br>narrative is the paradigmatic historical<br>style because events in a chronology do<br>not by themselves legitimate one<br>particular narrative over and above<br>another rather it is through the<br>operation of employment that facts are<br>structured in such a way that they<br>become components in a particular story<br>the point is that certain scientific<br>narratives come to dominate at<br>particular historical periods but later<br>on they may change and evolve as new<br>knowledge challenges old interpretations<br>in our field of Peace Studies all the<br>narratives of piecing and how to build<br>it based on things like stability and<br>neoliberalism are currently being<br>challenged and new narratives of peace<br>meta-narratives other stories and<br>they're sometimes also called master<br>narratives which are the grand<br>narratives of our time they persist over<br>long periods they cross over into<br>different domains and are often embedded<br>within a wide range of institutions and<br>practices in many cases they express<br>strict dualities such as the age-old<br>stories of good versus evil the<br>individual versus society and<br>civilization versus barbarism others are<br>teleological such as the narrative of<br>progress which is one of these paintings<br>or sovereignty and the Divine Right of<br>King<br>importantly these kinds of narratives<br>overlap and cross over my ontological or<br>personal narrative is connected to both<br>public narratives about the nation of<br>New Zealand and to scientific narratives<br>within the field which I'm a part of<br>similarly public narratives like the 911<br>narrative are embedded in larger<br>meta-narratives of good versus evil and<br>civilization versus barbarism even more<br>importantly all these types of<br>narratives are part of a particular<br>history and cultural setting and they<br>are therefore contingent they evolve and<br>change are reconfigured into new forms<br>and sometimes they vanish into the sands<br>of history there are numerous stories<br>which were once widely accepted and<br>which shaped and defined our society and<br>the people in it which are now simply<br>historical artifacts the earth is the<br>center of the universe the atom is the<br>smallest particle as women as the weaker<br>sex eugenics and racial hierarchies the<br>Divine Right of Kings torture as legal<br>method and human aggression as an age<br>these are all stories which no longer<br>convince or compel or define us looking<br>at the history of narratives it's only<br>reasonable to conclude that many of the<br>stories we accept as universal truths<br>today including many scientific truths<br>will perhaps one day lose their luster<br>drift away and be replaced by new<br>narratives about how the world and<br>society operates and how we ought to<br>live but what do narratives do in fact<br>they have a great many functions and<br>effects and I'm just want to run through<br>a few of them first of all the<br>construction of meaning this refers to<br>the way in which we require narrative to<br>make sense of events and facts without<br>some kind of narrative structure which<br>explains who the subjects are how they<br>are related and what the causal<br>relationships are facts and events are<br>meaningless for example in reference to<br>these pictures unless the media tells us<br>the stories of how terrorists attacked a<br>shopping mall in Nairobi and how police<br>treated protesters in Turkey<br>these pictures are pretty meaningless it<br>takes some kind of narrative to make<br>sense of what's happened and allow us to<br>draw lessons conceived of responses and<br>so on this is why it's so important how<br>events are narrative ly framed in the<br>media or by powerful social actors<br>because the meaning of the short story<br>can shape the possibility for<br>interpretation and response narratives<br>are also important for creating personal<br>and collective identity they shape how<br>we see ourselves and how we construct a<br>sense of who we are as Benedict and<br>Anderson put it nations are imagined<br>communities held together by collective<br>stories of common origins decisive<br>historical events common language and<br>shared culture which is often made up of<br>lots of shared stories the history of<br>nationalism demonstrates that these<br>stories are often invented or<br>retrospectively imposed on a range of<br>different groups in order to forge a<br>single national identity and in many<br>cases in order to construct a single<br>nation with one overarching story a lot<br>of smaller groups and their particular<br>sometimes as with the Scots Welsh and<br>Irish in the United Kingdom the Basque<br>and the Catalonian in Spain Maori and<br>New Zealand these groups have to fight<br>to have their stories heard and be<br>recognized crucially in constructing the<br>story of the nation you have to define<br>who is included and who is X cluded in<br>other words stories divide as well as<br>United I've already mentioned how<br>important a narrative is for<br>constructing history through the<br>organization of chronological events<br>into a single narrative but other kinds<br>of collective cultural stories myths<br>folktales parables and the like are also<br>important for creating meaning defining<br>roles disciplining people setting<br>boundaries of behavior and the like<br>every society has origin myths which<br>contain morals and guides Adam and Eve<br>in the Garden of Eden for example family<br>myths about sibling behaviour Cain and<br>Abel bogeyman myths<br>discipline our children and myths<br>related to taboo Greek mythology and the<br>Bible are the source of many such myths<br>in our society but every culture has<br>their own related to this narratives<br>play a crucial role in establishing<br>norms guiding moral behavior and<br>constructing what counts as common sense<br>the Good Samaritan and the boy who cried<br>wolf are examples of such stories in our<br>society but because narratives create<br>meaning and establishing identities and<br>set limits on behavior they also<br>function to enable and constrain action<br>and policy a good example today is the<br>story of the ticking bomb in which a<br>captured terrorists has crucial<br>information about a bomb that won't but<br>he won't give it up except under torture<br>this story has been widely disseminated<br>throughout our culture from moral<br>philosophy to movies television and<br>novels and to politics and law you can<br>see actually see it in the speeches of<br>Supreme Court judges in the United<br>States the US President and<br>vice-president and prominent Harvard<br>professors amongst others and as a<br>consequence the story influenced<br>interrogation policies in places like<br>Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo the story came<br>to be enacted in the actual practice of<br>coercive interrogation narratives<br>interestingly also leave their mark on<br>material objects and they can shape<br>material culture Monument and other art<br>objects which embody particular stories<br>are the most obvious example as our<br>museums which through their architecture<br>and the sequencing of exhibits create a<br>narrative structure to a particular<br>groups history such as toy to in in<br>Dunedin beyond this narratives can also<br>shape the urban environment I'm quite<br>interested in the way narratives of the<br>threat posed by terrorism for example<br>are shaping urban landscapes in places<br>like New York and London with security<br>barriers new road planning and<br>architectural forms which are reshaped<br>along the military lines of creating a<br>kind of green zone of security in the<br>center with concentric circles of<br>security emanating out words on a<br>negative viewpoint narratives also have<br>the power to maintain hierarchies and<br>create oppression there are stories<br>which in the past and stories which in<br>some case cases are still continuing<br>today which define groups and people in<br>certain ways which result in their<br>subjugation and oppression and which<br>maintain powerful hierarchies within<br>society there are too many examples to<br>name here but we need only to think<br>about the stories of Jews Gypsies<br>Africans homosexuals the homeless the<br>mentally ill and so on to realize that<br>some stories are made to justify the<br>most horrific forms of exploitation<br>cruelty and mistreatment but on the flip<br>side stories can be employed as part of<br>the struggle for liberation and change<br>the reclaiming of stories can be a way<br>of rejecting imposed identities and<br>undermining the justifications for<br>dispossession stories can be empowering<br>finally stories are powerful vehicles<br>for generating effect and emotion<br>stories can make you laugh we pour jump<br>for joy they can sink you into a<br>depression will move you to change your<br>life stories are in many ways the center<br>of our emotional lives in some stories<br>narratives make worlds they provide<br>structure and structures of meaning<br>guides for behavior shape our emotions<br>and enable and constrain action think<br>about the world of a hospital or a<br>school or a university or a stem Club an<br>army a church a family amurai the sports<br>team will think about the world of<br>international politics every single one<br>of these worlds has its own stories they<br>may be formal or informal institution<br>institution alized or casual conscious<br>or unconscious but they help to make<br>events and actions<br>meaningful they provide normative guides<br>enable and constrain practice defined<br>roles exclude outsiders suppress views<br>and so on in many respects they make<br>these worlds possible now I should just<br>say it's important to note that i'm not<br>suggesting that everything in the world<br>is made up of stories well that<br>narratives and stories are the most<br>important thing about the world or that<br>they are necessarily more important than<br>material structures all I'm suggesting<br>is that narratives can be a very useful<br>and powerful way of analyzing and<br>understanding how the world works how we<br>make meaning out of material reality and<br>how change sometimes occurs ladies and<br>gentlemen please stop thinking just<br>listen you are not here to learn if you<br>think critically you're only helping the<br>terrorists accept things as they are we<br>are here to ensure you can work and shop<br>without thought if you think you in<br>danger everyone's safety turn your minds<br>off critical thought can result in<br>conviction under terrorist legislation<br>don't take this risk I repeat stop<br>thinking it's for your own good shopping<br>as a way of fighting terrorism that's<br>actually a real story which George Bush<br>told the American people after 911 he<br>said the best way you can fight<br>terrorism is to go back and do normal<br>things like shopping how do we analyze<br>narratives there are a number of<br>specific approaches and tools I won't<br>spend a lot of time on this but in this<br>field we use things like genealogy which<br>involves tracing the emergence and<br>evolution of stories seeing where they<br>come from and how we arrived at the<br>present moment Michelle for Co calls<br>this uncovering the history of the<br>present we can also use deconstruction<br>which involves analyzing in great detail<br>the character and the political effects<br>of stories working out how they function<br>to enable or silence or suppress and<br>then there are a whole series of<br>specific tools such as discourse<br>analysis<br>this metaphor analysis and so on what I<br>would like to do is just talk briefly<br>now about how this approach narrative<br>analysis has become the central unifying<br>and most important theme in my research<br>over the past decade or so so I want to<br>talk about my past present and future<br>research in relation to the analysis of<br>stories in the first part of my career<br>and in my first three books and the<br>articles and chapters I wrote at that<br>time I focused largely on stories of<br>conflict and conflict resolution in<br>particular I became interested in war<br>stories or the public stories we need<br>for organized killing here I discovered<br>some commonalities between different<br>cases in other words if you look closely<br>at the run up to all wars and conflicts<br>which involved organized groups trying<br>to kill each other in the pursuit of<br>political goals you'll find variations<br>of the following narratives stories<br>based on these notions are what we need<br>in order to organize and plan and<br>practice killing on a large scale first<br>of all identity which are the stories of<br>self and other friends and enemies<br>patriotism and the political community<br>which we're nessus which are necessary<br>to know who we're fighting for stories<br>of threatened danger these are the<br>stories which tell us about why we need<br>to fight in order to protect ourselves<br>after September 11 for example we were<br>told that the terrors that terrorists<br>threatened democracy civilization and<br>our entire way of life and that's such a<br>threat therefore required a war to<br>prevent its realization stories of<br>grievance and victimhood most wars<br>involve narratives of victimhood we have<br>to fight because terrorists attacked us<br>well we have to fight because they<br>massacred our people hundreds of years<br>ago or because our land was taken and we<br>were left homeless stories about when it<br>is acceptable to kill these are the<br>stories which tell us that sometimes<br>killing is<br>justified and right commonly these<br>stories revolve around notions of just<br>war necessity emergency patriotism and<br>so on and finally the stories which are<br>required to suppress norms and to<br>suppress ideas of non-violence and human<br>solidarity these stories tell us that in<br>time of war old morality's don't apply<br>that our enemies are inhuman and<br>undeserving of mercy and that<br>non-violence doesn't work with some<br>kinds of people importantly many of the<br>specific narratives used to justify<br>particular Wars such as the Iraq war and<br>the Afghanistan war draw upon and employ<br>stories which already exist in society<br>which is why they resonate and seem to<br>be reasonable in common sensical stories<br>about how it is part of our national<br>identity to help our allies in war for<br>example well how the store or how the<br>struggle against the Taliban is part of<br>the historic struggle of civilization<br>against barbarism well how negotiation<br>and compromise is a form of appeasement<br>against some kinds of enemies these are<br>grafted on to the stories that<br>politicians use to justify going to war<br>and because we've been exposed to such<br>stories for so long because they<br>populate a pop collective imagination<br>and our national rituals and maybe even<br>our material culture it becomes very<br>hard to resist them or to consider<br>alternative courses of action so that<br>was my past my past research my present<br>research since around 2003 has been<br>focused on the public narratives that<br>make the world of counterterrorism and<br>security and here I've similarly<br>uncovered a number of powerful<br>narratives which I think define and<br>construct the nature of the terrorist<br>enemy the threat that they pose and the<br>actions necessary to defeat them so in<br>some of these books that I did during<br>this period some of the stories that we<br>possess about terrorism include the<br>notion of the evil inhuman terrorist now<br>this narrative follows a well-worn<br>path in which we have defined certain<br>groups and individuals as embodying a<br>kind of evil from barbarians to<br>anarchists Nazis and communists to<br>Hitler Stalin Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein<br>to serial killers and pedophiles such an<br>identity story sets the parameters for<br>how we respond to threats of terrorism<br>and it sets the ethical boundaries for<br>how we treat people who are seen to be<br>involved in it similarly the the story<br>about the dangerous threatening<br>terrorists this narrative is widespread<br>terrorists are everywhere apparently and<br>extremely threatening al-qaeda<br>operatives most certainly operating in<br>New Zealand as we speak according to<br>an al-qaeda terrorist undoubtedly these<br>first two narratives are wrapped up in<br>meta-narratives of good versus evil<br>civilization versus barbarism progress<br>versus backwardness there's another<br>important narrative about the unknowable<br>risk of terrorism interestingly I've<br>been looking at in recent work at what i<br>call the epistemological crisis of<br>terrorism which is the process by which<br>we've embraced a story about how<br>terrorism is characterized by unknown<br>unknowns in the immortal words of donald<br>rumsfeld in other words the dominant<br>narrative we have adopted says that<br>terrorists are completely unpredictable<br>and we don't even know the things that<br>we don't know about what they might be<br>up to the problem is that this creates a<br>crisis of knowledge because we can't<br>rely on any previous knowledge we are<br>now left with a void in which the only<br>option is to think up other imaginative<br>stories about what they might be up to<br>and in such circumstances everyone and<br>everything potentially could be<br>terrorism which explains partly how<br>politicians politicians justify the need<br>for mass surveillance the story about<br>the exceptional danger this is related<br>to the notion that terrorism possesses<br>an exceptional quality annex and is an<br>exceptional danger which means that<br>exceptional measures are required as<br>countless stories have told us over the<br>years and situations of exceptional<br>peril we must be willing to take the<br>most extreme measures to save ourselves<br>and then the story about the legitimacy<br>and effectiveness of forceful<br>counterterrorism the story is simply<br>part of a more established and widely<br>accepted story in our society which says<br>that sometimes you have to use violence<br>to fight violence now these stories<br>underpin the war on terror risk<br>management and contemporary security<br>policies in other words these stories<br>create the logic the ethics and the<br>possibilities for action and<br>sees the wars invasions military actions<br>extraordinary renditions torture<br>suspension of human rights draconian<br>laws and invasive security practices can<br>all be traced to these particular<br>narratives about terrorism now in<br>addition these stories of terrorism have<br>established what anthropologists call a<br>myth or a fee of terrorism which is now<br>dominant in Western societies and to a<br>lesser extent across the row globe and<br>this methyl fee is maintained by the<br>stories of terrorism which are told in<br>the media in academia and politics and<br>in popular culture films novels comics<br>video games and the like now partly in<br>response to this dominant metha graphy<br>and partly because the narrative form as<br>I mentioned using stories can be such a<br>powerful way of getting information and<br>ideas out into society I decided to<br>write an academic text as a novel this<br>novel is based on all the research I've<br>done into terrorism the militants I've<br>spoken to personally and all the<br>research biographies and autobiographies<br>of terrorism terrorists out there in<br>order to try and communicate a more<br>authentic portrayal of a militant or a<br>terrorist now I could have written<br>another academic book but I felt that a<br>novel might be a more effective mode of<br>communicating academic research to a<br>wider audience the theme of the novel is<br>based on the simple idea if you could<br>sit down with an actual terrorist and<br>ask them any questions what would you<br>ask most of us i SPECT would ask why are<br>you doing this how did you become a<br>terrorist what are you trying to achieve<br>what would make you stop and the<br>terrorist and my novel answers all of<br>these questions honestly but if you want<br>to know more you'll have to buy the book<br>now I can't tell you to order it for<br>Christmas because it has a publication<br>date of May 24 but it is available for<br>pre-order on amazon at the moment it's<br>going to be huge get in early and it<br>does make a great birthday present now I<br>just want to acknowledge three people in<br>particular who helped me a lot in<br>completing this novel writing fictional<br>narrative is very different discipline<br>to writing academic narrative and one<br>which I found very challenging but I<br>couldn't have done it without Elizabeth<br>dolphin a Richard McGrath too early and<br>ruler tool arm up one of our wonderful<br>PhD students each of whom in their own<br>way left an indelible mark on the<br>manuscript so don't worry we're getting<br>near the end my future research in my<br>future research I want to explore<br>stories of pacifism non-violence and<br>resistance in particular I'm interested<br>in how war stories and the myths around<br>militarism dominate our world it's clear<br>that most of our movies television shows<br>novels public monuments and the like<br>focus on stories of war heroic warriors<br>great military campaigns and the like<br>it's also clear that these stories are<br>part of our collective knowledge in our<br>collective vocabularies I've done<br>research in conversation analysis with<br>people asking them about how they<br>understand terrorism and every single<br>one of them use stories about World War<br>two and other wars to express their<br>ideas it just seems to be a natural part<br>of our the way in which we understand<br>the world but what are the stories of<br>non-violence and pacifism apart from the<br>well-known stories of Gandhi and Martin<br>Luther King jr. who are the heroes of<br>peaceful resistance and of principled<br>violence which other groups of people<br>fought non-violently for their rights<br>and succeeded do we know these stories<br>and where are they and how are these<br>stories suppressed and subjugated and<br>what's the effect of this what happens<br>to a society when all its heroes are men<br>and it's usually men of violence and all<br>that statues and commemorations are of<br>war and military<br>prism finally how can we liberate and<br>empower the stories of non-violence and<br>pacifism how can we make to fitty and<br>Gandhi into the superheroes our children<br>want to emulate how can we make the<br>diffusion of violence and the peaceful<br>settlement of disputes a more honorable<br>goal than winning military victory in<br>other words I want to explore how<br>narrative can be transformative and<br>could be in a way a way of creating<br>cultures of peace and I believe that<br>there's never been a better historical<br>moment to try and bring stories of peace<br>to the fore than right now in part<br>because we've got new evidence which<br>disproves many of the old war stories<br>which currently hold sway for example<br>there is a an incredibly powerful and<br>embedded story in society which I'm sure<br>you will know that human beings are<br>hard-wired for war and violence that<br>aggression is innate and that successful<br>societies are those which were able to<br>defeat other challenges the direct<br>consequence of this story is that most<br>people believe that war will never be<br>eradicated from human society it's just<br>part of human nature and therefore we<br>shouldn't even try to get rid of it but<br>we now know that that story is not<br>necessarily true scientific evidence<br>from a range of different quarters<br>including anthropology in neuroscience<br>is telling us that we are more likely<br>hard wired for empathy and cooperation<br>and sociality and that successful<br>societies are built on social capital<br>and trust and cooperation not self<br>interest in aggression similarly recent<br>research that we talk about a lot in our<br>Center by chenoweth and and Stefan shows<br>that nonviolent movements are more<br>successful than violent ones in<br>achieving their objectives even in the<br>face of the most severe repression this<br>adds to the growing body of evidence<br>which shows that war and violence are<br>never the sole remaining option nor is<br>violence the best option for dealing<br>with oppression and injustice a more<br>reliable and perhaps more positive story<br>is that pacifism and non-violence is<br>both ethically and<br>technically the better option in all<br>situations it's more likely to be<br>successful and more likely to produce<br>long-term peaceful outcomes finally I<br>believe that there's a growing global<br>consciousness that the war stories which<br>have that there's a glowing growing<br>global consciousness that the war<br>stories have failed us and are in any<br>case too wasteful and destructive the<br>price paid in Iraq and Afghanistan and<br>many more besides has been too high in<br>terms of lives and treasure especially<br>when alternatives exist so in conclusion<br>and this really is my conclusion over<br>the past few years I've had three<br>profound moments of recognition in<br>relation to my studies on war terrorism<br>and peace using narrative I've come to<br>see the world in a new way narrative is<br>a very powerful and illuminating<br>approach for understanding the nature of<br>our society our history why oppression<br>persists and how change sometimes occurs<br>I've also come to see that our stories<br>are historical their historical products<br>and in many ways they're there for open<br>to change even stories that are accepted<br>as universal and unchanging such as<br>those in science or religion or human<br>rights are often expressed and<br>understood in new ways as historical<br>circumstances and paradigms change and<br>finally as a result of this I've come to<br>see that each of us has the power to<br>change both personal and collective<br>stories stories are power I'm grateful<br>for your indulgence of the theatrical<br>elements to this lecture and I am<br>grateful to my wonderful students for<br>acting their excellent acting and their<br>willingness to help me out you may not<br>have been able to discern it but there<br>was a serious point to all that nonsense<br>apart from poking fun at the absurdities<br>of current counterterrorism and security<br>practices which actually i think is<br>quite you know using humor and satire to<br>resist dominant political practices as a<br>time-honored and quite effective former<br>political action the reality is that the<br>war on terror and global<br>counterterrorism<br>has demonstrably made the situation<br>worse and caused the great deal of<br>unnecessary and unconscionable suffering<br>and so we ought to resist it as much as<br>we can but the point of this particular<br>performance is that somewhere I suspect<br>in a series of memos committee minutes<br>University regulations and the like as<br>well as subconsciously as a result of<br>hundreds of years of practice there is a<br>story which says that an inaugural<br>professorial lecturer is a very solemn<br>ritual in which serious people say<br>serious things dressed in medieval<br>costumes of course and act with<br>appropriate levels of decorum the story<br>consciously and unconsciously as so many<br>stories in our society do sets limits on<br>the way we can act and what appears to<br>be possible it creates a defined and<br>constrained path for us to follow<br>similar social stories define how we<br>should act in other situations in the<br>classroom on the bus in social and<br>direction in Parliament in the voting<br>booth and so on so what my students and<br>I have tried to illustrate here is that<br>it is possible to change the story even<br>just a little we don't have to follow<br>the script set for us we are not<br>prisoners of the stories which society<br>or our institutions or our families tell<br>us because in some respects they are<br>just stories and because they're<br>contingent it means we always have the<br>choice to rewrite the story I think<br>particularly when it comes to the big<br>powerful stories about war militarism<br>patriotism and so on we can rewrite the<br>story I'm trying in my own small way to<br>rewrite some of the stories which hold<br>us back as a society and at the National<br>Center for peace and Conflict Studies<br>our students in our staff are also<br>working hard to write new stories of<br>peace resistance justice reconciliation<br>I am very proud to work here Dunedin<br>this university in the center feels like<br>the perfect place for me and I look<br>forward to many more years of exploring<br>and forging new stories together with<br>well I think your applause says that all<br>richard has demonstrated through this<br>discourse to us through the particular<br>stories he's told he's demonstrated the<br>power of his own personal story the<br>nature of the relationships that had<br>brought him to this place and this<br>moment in his life he's enabled us to<br>understand something of the ways in<br>which his story fits with our stories<br>and ways in which our stories fits with<br>other people's stories he's enabled us<br>to understand something of the<br>constraining power of narrative and<br>storytelling and it's liberty potential<br>he's described to us ways in which he's<br>turned turned his own personal interests<br>and passions into discourse of a<br>different kind and he's given us kind of<br>some understanding of the way in which a<br>critical theorist and a critical writer<br>can begin changing scripts so I'm really<br>privileged as a as the foundation chair<br>of this Center to have Richard here as<br>my colleague at the University of Targo<br>is well pleased to have you he's an A<br>grade on the PBR F and it gives us great<br>pleasure to welcome you here is the<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
