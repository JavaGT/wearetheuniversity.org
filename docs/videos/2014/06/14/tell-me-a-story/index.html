children, adolescents and young adults.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>podcast good evening and welcome to this<br>fantastic event that we are having this<br>afternoon um my name is harleen Hayne<br>and I am the vice Chancellor here at the<br>University of itago and I recognize many<br>of the faces in the audience because<br>this is a not only a university event um<br>but it's also a public event and we are<br>very proud of the participation of<br>members of the general public who come<br>and help us honor the amazing<br>achievements of our staff members who<br>have risen through the ranks um and are<br>giving their inaugural professorial<br>lectures so tonight is particularly<br>special um because not only are we<br>celebrating yet another fantastic<br>Professor um but it is a great personal<br>pleasure for me because Elaine is also a<br>very good<br>friend so I am very excited about being<br>here<br>um it is fantastic to see both general<br>staff and academic staff um come<br>together to actually listen to the<br>Brilliance of our professors here at the<br>University of itago and again as I say<br>all the time when I introduce the<br>professors um during their inaugural<br>professorial it is nothing short of an<br>amazing feat to be promoted to the rank<br>of Professor from inside this University<br>we are incredibly harsh on our own<br>and um people must demonstrate<br>excellence in research in teaching and<br>in service so to reach the point of<br>becoming a professor is truly something<br>that we should all come together and<br>celebrate so I welcome all of you on<br>behalf of the University of itago and I<br>would now like to hand over the<br>microphone to Professor Keith Hunter who<br>is the pro Vice Chancellor of Sciences<br>who will tell us just a little bit more<br>about the academic background of our<br>guest of honor thank<br>you<br>thank you Vice Chancellor and K<br>everybody it's great to see such a<br>pleasing tune out um like the vice<br>Chancellor I take great pleasure in<br>these events and I get the lucky job of<br>uh introducing each of the<br>speakers so Elaine was born and raised<br>in the deserts of West Texas and<br>there'll be a bit more about that later<br>and she graduated with honors in<br>Psychology from Trinity University in<br>San Antonio and then for a little while<br>she went to work in a patent translation<br>firm as a copy editor and I guess she<br>must have got sick of that uh and she<br>decided she needed to go back to school<br>so she then completed an Ma and PhD at<br>Emory University in Atlanta<br>Georgia um she first came to atago in<br>1993 although she bounced back to the us<br>for a little while uh for a few years<br>2001 and 2004 but obviously the<br>attraction of the United States had<br>paled in in relation to denen and she<br>came back uh to the University of tago<br>where of course we were really pleased<br>to have<br>her they say that um necessity is the<br>mother of<br>invention and in elain's case um she has<br>an alter ego which is called Mama<br>Elina and the story behind this is that<br>course she grew up in Texas and eat<br>Mexican food every day as you do when<br>you're in<br>Texas and then she arrived in New<br>Zealand in the early '90s and she<br>quickly found that tortillas cost a buck<br>a piece or a dollar in New Zealand terms<br>and that was something she couldn't<br>afford on her New Zealand lecturer<br>salary um so she had to learn how to<br>make torers and I understand that there<br>was quite a bit of trial and error went<br>into this but it's obviously quite<br>successful because she now has a YouTube<br>channel called Mama Alina and you can<br>look it up and you can watch her making<br>tortillas and and other Mexican<br>Delicacies and I have had a look at this<br>and it's real fun to<br>watch that's one of the pleasures of<br>introducing the speakers at these<br>lectures is I asked them for a personal<br>anecdote and the instructions are always<br>if I don't like the anecdote then I'll<br>make something up which I have not yet<br>had to do so that's great so all joking<br>aside um Elaine congratulations on your<br>richly deserved promotion to professor<br>and I now invite you to present your<br>inaugural<br>lecture<br>well soon after finishing this lecture<br>I'll be putting up my breakfast taco<br>video for anyone who wants to see<br>it so tenot tenot tenot katoa thank you<br>for coming this evening uh for me to<br>storytelling I'd first like to<br>acknowledge all of the families who have<br>participated in the research that I'm<br>going to tell tell you about today and<br>there are hundreds um hundreds of<br>families in denan uh in the US even some<br>in India who have um participated in our<br>research so my biggest Thanks goes out<br>um to all of those families who so<br>patiently given up their time and<br>because I do longitudinal studies they<br>don't get rid of us we just keep going<br>back and they've been so generous and<br>and kind to let us into their lives and<br>to share their stories with us and of<br>course i' i' also like to uh thank my<br>funders the Marsden fund um National<br>Institutes of Health uh Denita<br>kindergartens have been wonderful since<br>uh 1994 I've done research in den and<br>kindergartens and they've been so<br>supportive and also U my work on the<br>growing up in New Zealand study which uh<br>you may not know is a longitudinal Birth<br>Cohort study on the north island of over<br>6,500 families and um when all my other<br>funders there's always the division of<br>lucky now I'm going to start with a very<br>grainy photo it's grainy in more ways<br>than one uh first of all because it's in<br>West Texas Circa 1968 when I was 3 years<br>old and you can really barely see me<br>there on my father's knee with my big<br>brother and my little sister on the<br>other side uh with my uh with my<br>grandmother but what you can't see<br>behind the picnic table in this photo is<br>uh acres and Acres of sand dunes uh my<br>dad had this this idea that he would<br>take my 81-year-old mother out for a<br>picnic in<br>July uh in West Texas to the Sand Hill<br>State Park Kelly's laughing because<br>she's from Texas she knows that this is<br>a ridiculous<br>idea and that's pretty much what my<br>mother told me the other day when I<br>asked for a photo of my<br>grandmother um so somehow we survived<br>the Heat and what you're really supposed<br>to do in the Sand Hill State Park is<br>take garbage can Lids out there and you<br>slide down the sand dunes because we<br>can't ski so we slide down the sand<br>dunes but I probably my mother didn't<br>allow us to do that that day uh but we<br>seem fairly happy now I don't personally<br>remember this event uh my mother told me<br>about this event the other day when I<br>asked her for the photo uh so now that<br>family story um has been passed down to<br>me uh and now my kids are hearing it and<br>um and it enriches my store of stories<br>about about my family and it says quite<br>a lot about my dad's Spirit of Adventure<br>too that he he tried so hard to find<br>something fun to do even in the deserts<br>of West<br>Texas and the reason I wanted a picture<br>of my grandmother uh was that my love of<br>family stories really began with my<br>grandmother her name was Adele braier re<br>and um she was a natural<br>Storyteller in the 1960s she sold her<br>house in Florida and she decided that<br>she would go to live with each of her<br>five children for a couple of months at<br>a time now I don't know how her children<br>felt about this<br>Arrangement but I can tell you that her<br>24 grandchildren benefited hugely so my<br>little sister and I were number 24 and<br>number 22<br>respectively and every night when my<br>mother was cooking dinner in the kitchen<br>as moms did back in the day my<br>grandmother would regil us with Tales of<br>Adventure from her childhood growing up<br>in um homesteading in the piny woods of<br>Florida in the 1890s so she told us<br>these fantastic hair raising stories<br>about Panthers and horra wagons and even<br>a wedding out on the homestead and I<br>still remember those stories they've<br>stayed with me all these<br>years and I'd like to think that my uh<br>that I've become a little more<br>adventurous myself uh from hearing my<br>grandmother's Tales of<br>Adventure but this interest in family<br>stories laid dormant for many years<br>until I went to graduate school at Emory<br>University and there I<br>met robin fish who became my PhD<br>supervisor and I went there to study<br>human memory Robin had just embarked on<br>a longitudinal study of family<br>storytelling and it was a revelation to<br>me that I could turn my love of family<br>stories into something that I did for a<br>job and indeed it has become my life's<br>work so I'm extremely grateful to Robin<br>for over 25 years of steadfast support<br>and encouragement and I still<br>day so this interest in the way families<br>socialize children through narratives<br>didn't originate with Robin her<br>supervisor at City University of New<br>York was Katherine Nelson who is well<br>known for her work on autobiographical<br>memory and and narratives<br>uh I like to call her my academic<br>grandmother and she's okay with this and<br>um and she's been extremely<br>inspirational to me um and had a huge<br>influence on my thinking in the course<br>of my career and her theories of the way<br>that language shapes children's thinking<br>uh is uh<br>influential um it's inspired me and many<br>other researchers in this<br>room now I didn't personally know her<br>her supervisor at Yale University Child<br>study center bill<br>kessen but he was an influential scholar<br>of Child Development who really<br>foreshadowed the U important role of<br>culture in Child Development with his<br>1979 article the American child and<br>other cultural<br>inventions and kessen also had a keen<br>interest in shaping policy to help the<br>lives of Children and Families and<br>that's an interest that I share with<br>Bill and that I'm fortunate enough to be<br>able to uh play some part in through my<br>work on the growing up in New Zealand<br>policy so kessen in turn uh was<br>supervised by Kathy Maria wolf uh who<br>came to work at the Yale child study<br>center and she had worked with Charlotte<br>berer and with Jean P now all of you<br>will probably be famili amiliar with p's<br>name uh had an astounding influence on<br>contemporary views of how children think<br>and learn but not as many of you will<br>have heard of Charlotte berer because<br>she was in some ways overshadowed by her<br>more prominent husband and former PhD<br>adviser Carl buer who was a famous<br>linguist and who one of the founders of<br>Psychology so Charlotte bu conducted<br>influential lifespan studies of<br>development and she was known to some as<br>the founder of humanistic<br>psychology voty even followed bu's work<br>on infant development and is said to<br>have shaped his own theory of the<br>parallels between infant cognition and<br>the inventiveness of chimpanzees based<br>on on bu's ideas I discovered recently<br>that she even conducted a diary study<br>with over a hundred um adolescents and<br>that led to her notion of the importance<br>of purpose in life and that's an Insight<br>that I'm finding relevant to the work<br>that I'm doing now in adoles and<br>identity development that I'll tell you<br>about in just a<br>minute so of course my mentorship into<br>Academia didn't end with my PhD and two<br>very important people mentors for me<br>here at otago um have been harling Hayne<br>and Jeff white and I'm indebted to them<br>uh in so many ways<br>uh for their intellectual and personal<br>support uh just from Jeff encouraging me<br>to write my first Marsen application to<br>harleen helping me set up my child<br>development lab uh editing my papers and<br>even lending me maternity<br>clothes we we were wondering when um if<br>the third year students would notice<br>that there was sort of this departmental<br>reemerging<br>and of course I wouldn't have<br>accomplished any of the work that I'm<br>going to tell you about today without my<br>fantastic PhD students uh and<br>postdoctoral fellows so the first two<br>lines are the ones who've finished and<br>broken free uh the next row those who<br>are in the process and the final row are<br>my past and present postdoctural<br>fellows I've learned important things<br>from each and every one of these people<br>and they're a vital part of my life as<br>well as my work<br>and I've been so proud to see all of<br>them going on to interesting jobs<br>whether it's in Academia like Karen uh<br>Emily Allison and brinda or some of them<br>have gone on to be clinical<br>psychologists uh Kate and Amy um or as<br>researchers so Rihanna Nukem chinan and<br>uh Federica artioli and of course<br>there's Gabe the lone guy who did his<br>research on uh children's imaginary<br>Companions and then has gone on to work<br>figure and my master students too have<br>gone on to valuable work as policy<br>analysts at the Ministry of Social<br>Development and the Ministry of<br>Education and some of them have gone on<br>psychologists I'd like to thank all of<br>my collaborators both in this department<br>in New Zealand and and overseas for<br>their considerable research Acumen but<br>also uh because they're fun and<br>with and I'd like to thank the people<br>who really keep us going uh that's Sarah<br>Jane Robertson who's a research fellow<br>Donna Anderson and Sandy Sullivan who've<br>worked as research assistants over the<br>years and uh they just keep us all uh<br>doing what we need to do and they have<br>transcribed<br>literally uh thousands of conversations<br>between parents and children so I've got<br>some more thank yous at the end but<br>first I better tell you a little bit<br>research so why are family stor is<br>important well they're important because<br>they connect us to those that we're<br>closest to uh so in my book that just<br>came out I talk about how family stories<br>sustain us they teach us they protect us<br>and they join us to others<br>so most of us believe this intuitively<br>but it's only in the past 25 years that<br>we've accumulated the research that<br>backs up these beliefs with some<br>spin-off effects that Robin and<br>Katherine and I didn't even anticipate<br>25 years<br>ago the New York Times recently profiled<br>my supervisor Robin fish's work uh on<br>family stories and what she's been<br>finding is that pre-teens who know more<br>about their family history experience<br>better well-being so they have lower<br>levels of depression and anxiety they<br>have better coping skills and they have<br>stronger<br>self-concepts however 20 years ago when<br>I started my research Pro program at<br>otago we didn't know exactly how family<br>stories might affect children's<br>development now when you're a Child<br>Development researcher you can show<br>pictur pictures of your kids and get<br>away with<br>it what we knew at the time was that<br>parents told stories uh with their<br>toddlers And and that toddlers could<br>talk about the past from nearly when<br>they first started to talk so that might<br>surprise you that children start talking<br>about the past from nearly as soon as<br>they can talk so by the time they're one<br>and a half they're referring to recently<br>completed actions cookie all<br>gone uh or they're talking sometimes<br>about absent toys so in our house a<br>frequent FR uh when my youngest son was<br>one and a half was wear butter well you<br>sort of have to know the context butter<br>was a stuffed golden lab that i' gotten<br>at Walgreens or something when I was in<br>the states and this became Dylan's<br>favorite<br>toy<br>unfortunately he neglected butter and<br>left him in a reception area of a<br>Montreal<br>Hotel and for the next pretty much the<br>next month after we heard where<br>butter I tried to order a butter replica<br>off the<br>internet but when the new butter arrived<br>and Dylan opened the box butter was<br>bigger and darker than he was before and<br>we tried to convince him that he just<br>grown up from his travels in Montreal<br>jelled so what happens when when<br>toddlers start talking about the past is<br>that parents quickly fall follow in on<br>these little utterances and they'll say<br>things like where is butter did you<br>Montreal so my students and I set out to<br>explore how parents talk to their<br>toddlers about the past and this is work<br>with Karen Harley uh Kate faret Rihanna<br>Nukem and Amy<br>bird and with gracious funing for Marson<br>we started two longitudinal studies with<br>over 150 1 and a half-year-old children<br>from Dena<br>uh and to the best of my knowledge those<br>two Studies have turned into the longest<br>running studies of autobiographical<br>memory development in the world with our<br>latest data points at age 15 and<br>16 so our main technique is simple and<br>low Tech we simply give parents a tape<br>recorder and we asked them to talk about<br>a past event with the toddler we have<br>sort of moved up to digital tape<br>recorders now uh but unfortunately the<br>voice uh recognition software hasn't<br>caught up they still can't understand<br>toddlers or sometimes even adolescence<br>but maybe<br>someday and um whenever possible we ask<br>the parents to conduct the conversations<br>in their home to keep it<br>natural so what are these stories like<br>well they start out small and then they<br>grow so here's a story of uh Anna's<br>visit to the farm when she was one and a<br>half and by the way all of the names in<br>these examples have been changed in some<br>details um<br>um and as you can tell when Anna's one<br>and a half she's not saying very<br>much uh and not much that we can<br>understand but she is taking what we<br>call conversational turns so she is<br>taking part in the conversation and her<br>mother does something that turns out to<br>be very important so her mother um<br>despite and his lack of uh skill at this<br>Enterprise um keeps asking these what we<br>call open-ended questions<br>that um that have a wh question or how<br>question in them how word in them so<br>talk about when we went to the farm what<br>did we see at the farm da da da da um<br>what did you do to the and her mother<br>thinks that she just said little baby<br>lambs that's fine what did you do to the<br>Lambs what did you do to the Lambs at<br>the farm and how many lambs were there<br>uh and what did their taals do so her<br>mother through her questions is<br>basically fleshy in out the story for<br>Anna uh and what did Anna give to the<br>Lambs did you give them a bottle uh and<br>what was in the bottle and<br>finally oops finally Anna gives what we<br>would call A Memory response milk uh and<br>Mom Praises her clever girl milk in the<br>bottle well the next year when we went<br>back to see Anna this time her parents<br>were talking about going to pool bur<br>when she was 2 and a half and you can<br>see that Anna is producing more in the<br>way of words that we can understand and<br>even some memory information and you can<br>also see that her mother is still very<br>consistent in the way that she's having<br>these conversations giving lots of<br>information and using a lot of these wh<br>questions who went to pool what did<br>Mommy have to do what was Mommy doing in<br>essays not quite sure what Mommy was<br>doing with the essays but anyway<br>um and then um Mom wants to talk with<br>her about something that she didn't see<br>something that she did with her dad um<br>up to the hills it was something special<br>she does know that and Anna doesn't<br>really uh produce the answer that she<br>was looking for so her mom just says<br>that you saw some we lizards and you can<br>see that Anna gets a little<br>pronunciation practice in here she first<br>says<br>litters uh and then Mom tries again<br>lizards and Anna says<br>lizards so what we found when uh when we<br>looked at this over time was that the<br>moms and by the way I have done research<br>with Fathers as well when I was at IM<br>and we found that mothers and fathers<br>didn't really differ in the way they<br>talked about the past with kids so in<br>this study we have only moms but when<br>mothers gave those open Ed questions and<br>praise and all of that good stuff by the<br>time their children were three and a<br>half those kids who'd received more of<br>those um open in questions gave longer<br>memory narratives to a<br>researcher what we think is happening is<br>when you ask those wh questions um it's<br>helping the child to put their memory<br>into words to give voice to the memory<br>now this is a little narrative from Jake<br>who gave one of the best narratives at<br>age three and a half about going to<br>parade at for Berry Park and what you<br>first see is that they're producing a<br>lot more information by three and a half<br>and remember this is with a researcher<br>who isn't really helping them along<br>um so he talks about a dragon and horses<br>he's really wants to say a lot about the<br>horses um and but the other thing that<br>you'll notice from this example it's not<br>just about what was there what happened<br>but Jake is emphasizing some things over<br>others so because he's so interested in<br>the horses he's saying that lots and<br>lots and lots and lots of them were<br>there um and that there was this thing<br>that was real scary and we didn't go on<br>it because it goes way up high and the<br>other cool thing that that Jake is doing<br>is that he's talking about what didn't<br>happen but I didn't go on it um and what<br>could have happened it nearly got me<br>that horse and he's talking about what<br>might happen in the future when I'm a<br>bit older then I might go on that thing<br>that goes way up high so you can see<br>it's not just about memory anymore it's<br>about what the event means to him and<br>what he thinks you might be interested<br>in so that's pretty much what we found<br>in the early years is that and we call<br>this Rich reminiscing that the parents<br>are doing when they're asking those<br>open-ended questions and praise that the<br>mothers who did more of that had kids<br>with better memory skills better<br>narrative skills early literacy skills<br>stronger<br>self-concepts uh and in one study uh<br>with Mele tomoo when she was a post do<br>uh we even found that it helped<br>children's theory of mind now we in<br>these studies we weren't just foll<br>following children over time in a<br>naturalistic way when we suspected that<br>rich reminising was a good thing we also<br>started doing uh what we call an<br>intervention where we actually coached<br>some mothers in using these rich<br>reminising techniques and compared their<br>children to Children of mothers who were<br>just talking in their normal<br>way and um in that study uh that melee<br>participated in uh we found that the<br>kids who started out the study with low<br>language skills when their mothers use<br>Rich reminiscing their kids actually<br>have better theory of Mind by the time<br>they were three and a half and in<br>particular they had a better<br>understanding of the process of knowing<br>and<br>remembering and we think this is because<br>when mothers use retr menacing they're<br>also talking about how you engage in<br>this process of remembering and how you<br>know what you know so here's an example<br>of Anna again at the playground when<br>she's four and a half at a new<br>playground um and you see a lot of<br>consistency she's providing more<br>information but her mom does something a<br>little bit different she's talking about<br>oh so even though they were both there<br>at the playground I I don't remember<br>that part that even when you're both at<br>the same event you have a privileged<br>perspective on that event um and then um<br>Anna wants to talk about how her friend<br>Emily found a stinky part of the<br>playground and um and her mom says oh<br>that's how she knew it was stinky<br>because she went on the slide and and<br>she went through the stinky part uh<br>we'll get to some more<br>interesting examples here<br>um so the rich reminiscing turned out to<br>be a good thing for kids uh and in one<br>study so rich reminising is mainly about<br>uh parents and children talking about<br>events that they both remember but<br>family history is about more than just<br>the things that you remember it's also<br>about the stories that are passed down<br>to you and in one study that um that I<br>did with harleen Hayne and and Shelley<br>McDonald uh we found that when parents<br>talked with their children about the day<br>that their children were born which of<br>course the children can't personally<br>remember but is a very important event<br>um because it's the beginning of their<br>life U of their life<br>story um<br>that mody mums actually talked about the<br>birth stories in a much richer more<br>detailed way um than the European moms<br>now all parents talk about the birth of<br>their children in a detailed way uh but<br>the mod mum's narratives were so rich<br>that I actually couldn't even fit uh fit<br>them onto a slide so I'll go over into a<br>couple of slides here this is um him's<br>birth story and what is interesting here<br>is that Mom is talking about things that<br>happened before the birth she's talking<br>about the people who were there um and<br>she's also one thing that we found is<br>that the mody moms are specifically<br>talking a lot more about time and how<br>when everything happened and in relation<br>to everything else that happened um they<br>get a little off track talking about<br>moonium um well it's it's not well him<br>gets a little off track because she's<br>explaining it that he did a poo inside<br>mummy um and so him's like I did a poo I<br>did a poo and then you can see he's like<br>poo mom's a little more interested in<br>talking about when everything happened<br>and when they finally um got upstairs to<br>the ward and and this goes on and on and<br>on there's I couldn't even fit it all<br>there are 15 more turns that I couldn't<br>put on uh the PowerPoint but she ends it<br>in a lovely way you were a good boy and<br>you slept all the time a good baby um so<br>we think that these birth stories are<br>really important for setting the stage<br>starting the life story of the child<br>even though they don't personally<br>remember this um European Ms birth<br>stories are really lovely too they're<br>just not quite as long in detailed and<br>here's sort of a similar one Eric was<br>premature and his mom is talking about<br>about that how how M he was and all of<br>this uh again gets a little off track<br>because um she starts talking about how<br>he has hardly any ears and Eric's very<br>concerned where where where where where<br>where is my<br>ear and Mom calms him down well they<br>just hadn't grown properly um but you<br>know it's fine and you started to get<br>better so what happens to family<br>storytelling when children go off to<br>school<br>I'll just put in a brief plug here about<br>parents reading books with their<br>children which is my other line of work<br>so most of you will know that reading<br>books to your preschooler helps their<br>vocabulary skills helps them learn new<br>words and it helps their story skills<br>but uh and all of that spells success in<br>children's reading later on particularly<br>for their understanding of what they<br>read on their own by the time they in<br>year three or four but what you may not<br>know is that when children first start<br>to learn to read the vocabulary that<br>they're getting from their early readers<br>is not stretching their own vocabulary<br>development um it's very simple<br>vocabulary so it's not until about age<br>uh till year three or four that they're<br>able to learn new vocabulary from the<br>books that they're reading on their own<br>so that's why always like to put in a<br>little plug saying if you do have a<br>child who's just learning to read in the<br>first years of primary school keep<br>reading to them even after they start<br>school because the books that you'll<br>read to them have more complex story<br>lines U more advanced<br>vocabulary uh than they can than they're<br>reading so in terms of children's<br>storytelling uh one major development is<br>that by around really by around age six<br>the kids get to the point where they are<br>uh telling pretty coherent stories<br>here's the story of Anna's First<br>Sleepover um again with her friend Emily<br>and we can pretty much understand<br>everything that happens you know it's<br>got sort of a nice uh linear narrative<br>we know when things happened we know<br>what happened we even know some<br>departures from the norm that usually<br>they don't go to ballet on Sunday but<br>they did that Sunday we just have to and<br>um and there's even a little ending and<br>that's<br>all however it's not a very exciting<br>story is it uh because we don't really<br>have much in the way of emotion or<br>detail or description so in<br>contrast uh for this age child they're<br>really still needing their parents to<br>tell the more interesting stories so<br>rata uh with her mother's help tells a<br>pretty good story about<br>rarua and um and in particular about the<br>smells of Rua and I'm sure that you can<br>um understand what the word Pao means<br>from the context so uh I particularly<br>like that hot brown and steamy<br>bit so you can tell if you really want<br>to engage your kids in storytelling add<br>some scatological references<br>there okay then we get to early<br>adolescence age 11 to 12 parent child<br>storytelling definitely changes and for<br>some parents and kids it sort of turns<br>into a bit of of a jungle because it<br>gets a lot more negotiated a lot more<br>emotional but for other diets it turns<br>into this really lovely collaborative<br>storytelling and um I'm going to rely on<br>Anna again to show you an example of<br>what I call reminiscing of the highest<br>order because what they're doing Anna<br>and her mom are talking about uh their<br>trip to dream world uh which happens to<br>be the week that they went on holiday<br>was the only week it had rained at Dream<br>World for almost a year um and they just<br>tell a really nice story together but<br>what you can see in contrast to the<br>earlier examples of Anna is that she's<br>now leading the storytelling she's<br>starting the conversation and Mom is<br>just sort of chiming in supporting<br>Anna's story um but she's not leading it<br>in other directions and it turns out<br>that this is definitely the best way to<br>do it if you have a young adolescent to<br>let them tell the story and you can be<br>the backup um but if you start directing<br>uh things too much they will just pretty<br>much stop the<br>conversation uh so she tells a really<br>great story lots of detail about all the<br>animals what was funny um um some cool<br>things that<br>happened uh pretty much goes along like<br>that but then Mom do step in at the end<br>and this is where uh pre-teens still<br>need parents' help uh because what<br>happens is they start talking about the<br>last day when they went to brby Island<br>and Anna says we swam in the sea and<br>mother mom sort of jumps in here and it<br>was warm a sort of implicit contrast to<br>denan beaches perhaps uh and it didn't<br>rain there that day no it didn't rain<br>that day so now Anna's responding mom it<br>was our nice day and Anna says Saturday<br>the day before we went home and it turns<br>out this is really important putting<br>that positive spin on what could have<br>been quite a negative event you know the<br>only week to go to dream world and it<br>rains nearly the whole week and Mom<br>pulls it to this nice positive<br>resolution and what we're finding is<br>that the parents who do this when with<br>their kids when they're aged 12 that<br>those kids go on to become teen<br>teenagers who have better communication<br>with their parents uh who trust their<br>parents more and who are less alienated<br>from them and from their peers which is<br>pretty much what we want for all of our<br>it and as a bonus if your parent is a<br>rich reminiscer it turns out in work<br>with uh harling Hayne and Shelley<br>McDonald and and F Jack uh that it turns<br>out that as an adolescent you actually<br>have have earlier memories as well so<br>your personally remembered life story<br>starts at a younger age if your parent<br>was a richer<br>iser all right then we come to the<br>teenage years and yeah it's pretty much<br>a black hole for us in terms of<br>parenting<br>conversations because we haven't<br>successfully gotten teenagers to record<br>conversations with their<br>parents so we've tried a couple of<br>different ways in both ways only about a<br>third of them end up doing it and as far<br>as we can tell that third of teenagers<br>They Don't Really differ from the<br>two-thirds who won't do have a<br>conversation with their parents in any<br>discernible way so we're not quite sure<br>what's going on there only that we're<br>going to have to get more<br>inventive um in our methods so what is<br>happening with teens so in start<br>contrast to how they don't want to talk<br>with their parents they come into the<br>lab and tell us extremely detailed life<br>stories and in fact one life story uh<br>that we've collected is a 50 Page Long<br>transcript so I'm sure part of their<br>willingness to engage is that we have a<br>fantastic team of interviewers who hang<br>on there every word and uh and they<br>there's no judgment or evaluation so<br>perhaps parents could learn something<br>from this if they want to have more<br>detailed conversations with their<br>teenagers so in a new study funded by<br>maren that we're doing uh that we<br>started a few years ago with Chi Wang at<br>Cornell and that's um Helena melli Tia<br>chinen and ell miari we were responding<br>to uh Professor Tilman habermas's idea<br>that it's not until about age 15 that<br>adolescence get what he calls a life<br>story so before that AG age they can<br>remember events they can narrate events<br>and I've shown you that they can do this<br>but before about age 15 they're not very<br>good at connecting what's happened to<br>them in the past uh in the service of<br>understanding who they are and<br>integrating those events so here's an<br>example from um our study that we're<br>doing with uh three cultures of<br>adolescence um Chinese European and<br>modern New Zealand adolescence now<br>here's an example of a younger uh<br>teenager who's really not connecting<br>things she talks a little bit about how<br>she shy going to a new school and then<br>amazingly she meets this guy and we just<br>start hanging out but there's no real<br>connection here of how did she go from<br>being this shy girl to being this person<br>who could just find this guy and hang<br>out in contrast an older teenager talks<br>about uh working on the School<br>production and talking about how that<br>event made her realize that she could be<br>a leader and that she could um that she<br>could be independent and do things on<br>her own so she's connecting that event<br>in um in helping her understanding of<br>herself and what we're<br>finding is pretty much exactly what hos<br>predicted in that it is around age 15 to<br>16 that teenagers are starting to have<br>these insights into life events and what<br>and in that same study well you might<br>ask why does it matter how well you tell<br>a life story well as adults when we tell<br>more coherent connected life stories we<br>experience better well-being so we have<br>lower levels of depression we have<br>better life<br>satisfaction uh and we have higher<br>self-esteem so we wanted to know at what<br>point do adolescence benefit from these<br>connections that they're making in their<br>life stories in terms of their<br>well-being<br>um and what we're finding so far is that<br>uh with the younger teenagers the 12 to<br>14 year olds the 15 to 17 year olds uh<br>they're really not uh benefiting from<br>their knowledge in the life story in<br>terms of their well-being so even the 15<br>to 16 year olds you would think oh well<br>they're starting to make those<br>connections but it's not translating<br>somehow into their well-being so it's<br>really not until age 18 to 20 that a<br>more coherent life story translates into<br>better well-being into lower levels of<br>depression and higher<br>self-esteem and really importantly we<br>are finding that this is true across all<br>three cultures that we've studied so<br>whether uh the Adolescent is Chinese<br>European or malerie it's really not<br>until age 18 to 20 that they're starting<br>to get it and and they're making those<br>positive connections and it's spilling<br>over into their<br>well-being<br>and hot off the press in the same study<br>we asked these adolescents how much they<br>knew about their family's history such<br>as where their grandparents were born um<br>or something details about their<br>mother's and father's childhoods the<br>Moder and the European adolescence<br>reported more knowledge of their family<br>history than the Chinese<br>adolescence and very importantly both<br>the maer and Chinese adolescents who<br>knew more of their family history they<br>reported stronger cultural identities<br>and better<br>well-being so if we're able to continue<br>following the children from our earlier<br>longitudinal studies into young<br>adulthood we'll be able for the first<br>time to trace the importance of family<br>storytelling throughout kids' lives to<br>their identity and well-being in<br>adulthood and uh following them into<br>midlife if I'm around long enough may<br>offer another turn turning point in<br>terms of understanding the curveballs<br>that life throws at you and trying to<br>maintain your well-being in the face of<br>negative life events and that'll be<br>something to keep me busy and out of<br>years uh so again I'd like to thank my<br>lab they're a fantastic group such hard<br>workers uh and really fun as well um<br>even get dressed up sometimes and and<br>I'd like to thank everyone in the<br>psychology ology Department it's just a<br>fantastic place to work um and<br>hardworking as well and very fun and<br>special thanks to carara for helping me<br>with the PowerPoint anything that looks<br>Cara and I'd like to thank the Craven<br>Cruz Clan uh myo my<br>friends uh and I'd just like to say a<br>special word about Tomar M for um friend<br>and colleague uh that we all miss a<br>great<br>deal um and special thanks to David<br>Green and Family for being so<br>caring and of course my family in Texas<br>even though they're far away uh they<br>always have my back I had to call my<br>mother this morning for support just<br>never get too old for<br>that and of course these two<br>guys who were the source of my best and<br>stories so just like to end that family<br>stories can give children a better start<br>in life they can give adolescents a<br>reason to keep going they can give young<br>adults the wisdom to make good<br>choices so what I'd like to ask of all<br>of you is that you go home tonight or<br>tomorrow and you tell a story no matter<br>how small to your child or your teenager<br>or your parent or your<br>partner uh even your<br>grandchild and I hope you'll be glad<br>did<br>thank you Elaine that was terrific<br>really<br>was<br>um uh I'm my name is David bulky I'm the<br>head of Department of psychology uh<br>where Elaine Works um and I'm going to<br>tell you a<br>story um but there is some audience<br>participation um if I put my hand up<br>like that I want you to just go wild and<br>just Yahoo and yell and so can we just<br>try that you ready<br>y you guys are good<br>okay so here's the story it's a story<br>about a young woman who came here to the<br>Magical Kingdom a long long time<br>ago so long ago that it's almost lost in<br>the mids of time but we know actually<br>that it was<br>1993 she came here from a land far far<br>away a land known as The fabled Lost<br>Continent of<br>Atlanta<br>Georgia the young woman sat down Roots<br>here and had a<br>family and although she was lured away<br>for a short time to the land far far<br>away the denisons of the Magic Kingdom<br>worked hard to get her back back because<br>they knew that she had much<br>promise the young woman worked hard in<br>the Magical Kingdom and in that work she<br>grew and grew and grew and grew so you<br>all ready and in fact she grew so much<br>yay the end well in fact I'm sure not<br>the end at all but so that on a nutshell<br>is really the story of el ela's progress<br>um as an academic in the course of her<br>still relatively short career she has<br>grown so much as a researcher a teacher<br>and as an<br>academic and we saw the results of that<br>in her talk tonight she's a researcher<br>who's internationally prominent in her<br>field she's over 60 uh peer-reviewed<br>public ations to her credit and recently<br>a soul authored book uh just<br>out over and above that her work has<br>been very<br>influential in contributing and<br>influencing policy development and she<br>has worked hard and succeeded and having<br>an<br>impact through Outreach into her<br>community and again as you would have<br>gathered from her talk tonight Elaine<br>has a reputation as a great supervisor a<br>great teacher and Mentor for all his<br>students and particularly for the Mari<br>and Pacifica<br>students she's an enormously valued<br>member of our department<br>thoughtful and always guaranteed to<br>provide wise and fair<br>comment Elaine your work on sharing<br>stories is really important not least<br>because you've been able to show that a<br>cultural tradition that dates back to<br>prehistory is still so important right<br>here and right<br>now you've reminded us of the importance<br>of<br>stories and just a quote from the author<br>Erin<br>Morganstern you may tell a tale that<br>takes up residence in someone's Soul<br>becomes their blood and self-purpose<br>that taale will move them and drive them<br>and who knows what they might do because<br>of it because of your<br>words there's magic in that it's in the<br>listener and for each and every year a<br>it will be<br>different and it will affect them in<br>ways that they can never<br>predict so I'd like you to all join with<br>me in congratulating Elaine on her<br>promotion to professor and to thank her<br>for her for sharing her story tonight<br>tonight and for reminding us of the<br>importance of stories in our own lives<br>children</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
