font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well welcome um it's my pleasure to<br>introduce Michael but I I think I will<br>start off by actually welcoming his<br>family it's good to see the family here<br>um his mother and father John and ler<br>from Gore um I pres I'm looking at them<br>and um his wife Fiona<br>and his three daughters Alice Charlotte<br>and Emily so um having been through this<br>myself I I know how important it is for<br>the family and uh it's important for the<br>University as well as the family so<br>welcome and uh I hope you entertained by<br>this um I think we all will be um so my<br>job is to actually outline um why<br>Michael has received this Accolade and<br>um and its purpose is not just to<br>receive an Accolade the purpose is to<br>actually put him in a position where he<br>may continue on um within the university<br>um such a title helps with research<br>Grant<br>applications uh and and how you were<br>seen across the rest of the country and<br>across the world so we don't see this as<br>the end we actually see this as actually<br>achieving a certain level of uh of<br>Excellence that actually supports the<br>university and and continuing to move<br>forward and certainly that's true for<br>the denan School of Medicine<br>so the story for Michael I think is<br>quite interesting I try and spend some<br>time before I do these introductions<br>trying to understand how people move<br>what pathway they move through to<br>actually get to this position and so I<br>did sit down uh with Michael uh who I<br>actually know in another form because<br>he's also my cardiologist so I've got to<br>so I've actually got to say the right<br>things you might give me the wrong<br>prescription uh but it is an interesting<br>story uh he comes from was born in Gore<br>uh and brought up in Southland and this<br>and uh this is important I think as we<br>move<br>forward um because uh the the the needen<br>school has really important connections<br>with uh Southland and we now see in fact<br>the denan school of medicine almost as<br>being the southern school of medicine<br>and we see the Southland area as really<br>part of of us uh and um and we hope that<br>we're moving to the position where the<br>competition is less than we actually see<br>um that we are part of Southland as well<br>so that's it's really important to see<br>that that we're becoming a unit rather<br>than two competing<br>bodies so Michael uh came through<br>Southland went through uh school um High<br>School uh in South and area uh did<br>medicine uh at the um attiga medical<br>school and um in fact graduated in 1985<br>just at the time that I was coming to<br>denan as my first year as<br>consultant um so it shows you my age um<br>he went through U medicine he got one of<br>the the top prizes uh at the end of his<br>undergraduate training uh he then went<br>on and did a diploma of obstetrics tells<br>me that he had some difficulty in quite<br>deciding uh what specialty he would go<br>into uh finally decided uh medicine was<br>the way he was going to go and then into<br>Cardiology um he did was a health<br>surgeon registar Cardiology regist and<br>then a clinical tutor uh at denan<br>hospital so he's not moved very far at<br>this stage he's staying close to home so<br>to speak um and then he goes to Boston<br>uh to Massachusetts General<br>Hospital uh where he has a research<br>Fellowship uh to study um echocar<br>cardiography um and then uh is uh<br>awarded a repatriation fellowship uh<br>from the Southland Medical Foundation to<br>actually then come back really doing<br>full-time research as a senior research<br>fellow for proximately four years um at<br>the end of that time he applies for and<br>gets a job as consultant in denan<br>hospital and that's a full-time job uh<br>and he's effectively stayed uh in a<br>full-time Hospital role um until about<br>two years ago when he he's had a 210<br>university appointment as well um and so<br>that's important because when you think<br>about somebody who's actually delivering<br>a clinical service for the bulk of his<br>uh uh office actually working time how<br>do you then attain um a professor's role<br>within the university so I was curious<br>about how this<br>he's he was appointed be um because he's<br>now got um 122 peer-reviewed<br>Publications which is hard to<br>achieve uh two chapters in a book and uh<br>the when you look at the list of Grant<br>uh or of studies that he's been involved<br>well it goes for at least a page and a<br>half the the story is more of a person<br>that how how do you do this when you're<br>actually in a full time job doing<br>something else and so this is what I was<br>trying to pin down and from my<br>observation and my discussion with him<br>it seems to be that there are some<br>people who observe are curious about<br>what's around them uh and want some<br>questions answered he tells me that he's<br>quite a meticulous person and that he<br>likes everything in the right place um<br>and when things are not making sense and<br>not in the right place he he he likes to<br>put them in the right place so he was he<br>likes numbers um but I was reminded of<br>the story about uh you know about the<br>scientist who uh discovered penicillin<br>uh who did it by looking at a growth of<br>a contaminant of a petri place where<br>there was bugs growing and the facts<br>that the bugs didn't grow U because of a<br>fungus growing on that particular petri<br>dish uh observed that and that led in<br>the due course to actually the discovery<br>of penicillin um so people who actually<br>observe what's around them get curious<br>get annoyed when things are not right<br>and try and understand why they're not<br>right uh and then proceed uh to uh to<br>actually follow through on that now<br>following through when you're a<br>full-time clinician is just about<br>impossible and this you connect um<br>sideways with other people who are<br>actually doing lots of other research as<br>well so it's the combination I believe<br>of the Curiosity the wanting things in<br>the right place but also serendipitously<br>sometimes are connecting with people who<br>will help answer the questions and so<br>when you look at his career and look at<br>the Publications they're actually always<br>working with somebody else um and<br>bringing to a collaborative team the<br>clinical view of things the the<br>connection sideways is saying you can't<br>say that that is stupid if you don't<br>know the clinical scenario so he's<br>bought the clinical the clinical breadth<br>of a practicing physician uh into the<br>research question that has allowed the<br>the research questions to actually be<br>much more um I guess tailored to real<br>life and answering real questions rather<br>than some tiny thing that's not relevant<br>so he's made sure that the research he's<br>involved with is very relevant to<br>society and I think that leads us really<br>nicely to the topic of his talk the<br>prevention and cure the fight against<br>cardiovascular disease still the largest<br>cause of death uh if you're going to die<br>chances are is going to be<br>cardiovascular disease or cancer uh and<br>so he's taken one of the biggest areas<br>of causes of death in in New Zealand uh<br>and he's going to now talk to us about<br>his approach and his thoughts about um<br>the prevention and treatment of<br>Michael Professor Squire Professor<br>Taylor thanks very much for that um kind<br>introduction ladies and gentlemen this<br>evening I'm pleased to take the<br>opportunity to share with you uh some of<br>the exciting advances in cardiology<br>during the last half century and in<br>particular the huge progress that has<br>been made in treating coronary artery<br>disease before considering this topic we<br>need to have an understanding of what<br>coronary artery disease means the<br>coronary arteries run over the surface<br>of the heart<br>and a small 2 to 3 mm sized vessels<br>coronary artery disease is the<br>accumulation of cholesterol and blood<br>fats inside the wall of the artery which<br>is called a coronary<br>plaque fats in the wall of the artery<br>gradually accumulate and narrow the<br>artery such that blood flow is<br>diminished and when persons are<br>exercising they develop symptoms of<br>chest tightness otherwise known as<br>angina<br>a heart attack occurs when a clot forms<br>on this coronary plaque blood flow is<br>obstructed and the person suff suffers<br>discomfort the rate of coroni artery<br>disease in the community has been<br>strongly influenced by improvements in<br>socioeconomic status cigarette smoking<br>increased food consumption excessive<br>alcohol intake and physical<br>vices coronary heart disease was<br>actually uncommon as a cause of death in<br>the early part of the 20th century as a<br>consequence of industrialization<br>increasing urbanization and growing<br>Prosperity coronary artery disease<br>prevalence increased rapidly over the<br>first half of the 20th century reaching<br>a peak in New Zealand in about<br>1968 this graph shows New Zealand<br>coronary heart disease mortality for<br>males and females from the period 1968<br>through to<br>2010 as you can see in this graph the<br>age standardized mortality rate for ES<br>schic heart disease shows a marked<br>downward Trend over the period in fact<br>there was a 70% decrease between 1980<br>and<br>2010 over the period the male age<br>standardized rate was approximately<br>double the equivalent female<br>standardized r rate of death in 2010 es<br>schic heart disease was the second<br>leading cause of death after cancer<br>males accounted for just over 50% of all<br>deaths an intriguing question is<br>therefore why has there been such a<br>dramatic decline in coronary heart<br>disease mortality over this time there<br>appear to be two main factors<br>contributing to the decline and<br>cardiovascular mortality the first<br>relates to changes in diet in lifestyle<br>or other risk factors which account for<br>about half the reduction in mortality of<br>this reductions in colesterol blood<br>pressure and reduced smoking along with<br>increased physical activity have<br>decreased the rate of<br>mortality the second major area again<br>contributing approximately 50% to the<br>reduction in mortality relates to better<br>treatments and during the course of this<br>talk I will address each of these areas<br>most of the benefits um in persons who<br>have established coronary disease come<br>from improved drug treatment and stent<br>treatments after acute heart<br>attack this huge progress has been<br>underpinned by greatly improved<br>understanding of the causes and<br>disease science has played a crucial<br>role in developing our understanding of<br>the cause of cardiovascular and coronary<br>artery disease<br>atherosclerosis is an inflammatory<br>process which affects medium and small<br>arteries throughout the vascular system<br>We Now understand that the earliest<br>changes of atherosclerosis can be<br>identified in<br>childhood when the lining otherwise<br>described as endothelium of blood<br>vessels as exposed to raise levels of<br>low density lipoprotein cholesterol and<br>certain other substances the endothelium<br>becomes permeable to immune system cells<br>these cells migrate across the<br>endothelium into the deep layers of the<br>walls of the blood vessel a series of<br>reactions occur there attracting LDL<br>cholesterol particles to the site these<br>particles in turn become internalized to<br>become foam cells and lesions are formed<br>in the cell wall which are called an eus<br>plaque over time this will enlarge with<br>further accumulation of lipids cells and<br>fibrous tissue<br>arteries are vessels which generally<br>carry oxygenated blood to supply the<br>organs of the body the endothelium is<br>the single layer of cells which lines<br>the inside wall of the arteries in the<br>human body it provides a barrier between<br>the blood which is sitting in the Lumin<br>of the vessel and the cells making up<br>the deeper layer of the arterial<br>wall the endothelium weighs about a<br>kilogram in the average human and in an<br>adult human being has been estimated to<br>comprise a surface area of up to 7,000<br>sare M which is hard to visualize this<br>is equivalent to the surface area of the<br>Rugby field at for Bar<br>Stadium and small to medium arteries the<br>middle layer of the vessel is consists<br>of smooth muscle<br>cells and these smooth muscle cells can<br>facilitate changes in size of the artery<br>Vaso constriction where the vessel gets<br>smaller and Vaso<br>dilation where the vessel gets larger<br>which can influence blood flow<br>throughout the<br>body the vascular endothelium is a<br>complex organ with a large number of<br>functions it controls vasomotor tone<br>which we've just discussed influencing<br>whether the blood vessel can have more<br>or less blood flow endothelial cells<br>also determine the balance between<br>maintaining normal blood flow and<br>clotting which is required to stop<br>bleeding when there is an<br>injury IND cells have a complex system<br>of chemical sensors and the ability to<br>synthesize multiple mediators as a whole<br>the endothelium is the largest endocrine<br>gland in the body secreting biologically<br>active mediators into the<br>blood endothelial dysfunction occurs<br>when cardiac risk factors have an<br>adverse effect on the functioning of<br>endothelial cells such factors we've<br>discussed before include high<br>cholesterol diabetes cigarette smoking<br>and aging<br>dysfunction of these endothelial cells<br>has a direct consequence of decreasing<br>levels of nitric<br>oxide and the flow on effects include<br>Vaso constriction or or getting the<br>vessels getting<br>smaller increased platelet stickiness<br>and<br>clotting another adverse effect is<br>increased levels of super oxide which<br>creates oxidative stress and other<br>adverse<br>effects so where does endothelial<br>dysfunction fit in the development of<br>coronary artery disease at the beginning<br>of the process a coronary risk factors<br>which we've just discussed including<br>high cholesterol diabetes or cigarette<br>smoking these risk factors are<br>influenced by genes which determine the<br>risk for coronary artery disease to date<br>there are about 46 genetic abnomalities<br>identified which increase the<br>susceptibility to coronary artery<br>disease many of these genes are are<br>inherited in families and this is why<br>family history is an important<br>determinant of cardiac risk the final<br>common pathway however is endothelial<br>dysfunction as evidenced by decreased<br>production of nitric oxide increased<br>levels of inflammation and an increased<br>risk of<br>clotting given that endothelial<br>dysfunction is a very early change in<br>atherosclerosis I became interested in<br>using endothelial function to assess the<br>impact of diet on the potential<br>long-term risk of atherosclerosis in<br>human subjects now measurement of<br>endothelial function is achieved simply<br>uh with a surrogate technique with an<br>ultrasound machine and a blood pressure<br>cuff a vascular ultrasound probe is used<br>to take an image of an artery in in the<br>arm the braal artery and here we can see<br>the uh probe being positioned over the<br>braal<br>artery the next part of the procedure is<br>to inflate the blood pressure cuff for 5<br>minutes<br>which leads to no blood flow into the<br>forearm and Es schema of the forearm<br>after release of the cuff this<br>stimulates a marked increase in blood<br>flow Down The Vessel The increased flow<br>increases sheer stress across the indial<br>cells and they synthesize nitric oxide<br>which is released through the visal wall<br>res resulting in dilation or an increase<br>in size this is referred to as flow<br>mediated dilation<br>I have an image here of a braal artery<br>markedly magnified it's a relatively<br>small vessel and at normal size can be<br>up to approximately 3<br>mm as part of the technique the blood<br>pressure cuffers inflated uh Above This<br>artery blood flow stops 5 minutes<br>elapses the cuff is released marked<br>increase in flow and in the normal<br>situation you'll see that after<br>remeasurement there has been an increase<br>in the size of that<br>vessel when persons have normal<br>endothelial function the artery will<br>dilate by between 5 and<br>15% in the presence of endothelial<br>dysfunction the dilation of the arteries<br>is<br>reduced it is widely understood that a<br>diet largely consisting of high fat<br>takeaway food will likely result in an<br>increased risk of cardiovascular disease<br>deep frying food increased es the amount<br>of fat oxidation products in the food<br>and potentially may increase the risk<br>for<br>atherosclerosis using brachial artery<br>flow mediated dilation to assess<br>endothelial function we assess the<br>short-term effect of dietary fat on<br>endothelial function we wish to examine<br>whether deep fried food had a<br>potentially worse effect in excess of<br>its saturated fat<br>content we therefore enrolled 10 healthy<br>men in the study who are all randomized<br>to each of three test meals in random<br>order<br>uh my research colleague Dr Wayne Solen<br>developed an ingenious method to present<br>a standard meal with varying levels of<br>fat content and fat type he designed a<br>lowfat meal consisting of a chocolate<br>flavored Milkshake the unused fat meal<br>was prepared by adding 46 gram of unused<br>cooking fat to the lowfat<br>meal to test the oxidation hypothesis we<br>obtained used cooking fat that had been<br>used for deep frying during a week in a<br>volunteer 46 gram of the used cooking<br>fat was added to the lowfat meal the<br>quantity of fat in the added fat meals<br>approximated that which is found in an<br>average fast food meal the low fat and<br>unused fat meals or milkshakes were<br>quite<br>palatable the used fat meal had an<br>initial chocolate taste with an<br>burger here are the results from our<br>study Baseline endothelial function is<br>shown in red and as these were healthy<br>men endothelial function was normal at<br>about 5%<br>dilation in the control fat meal there<br>was no change at 4 hours after ingestion<br>and similarly<br>the meal that had unused cooking fat had<br>no significant<br>effect the used fat meal significantly<br>and dramatically reduced endothelial<br>function at 4 hours after<br>intake we concluded that intake of a<br>degraded products of heated fat resulted<br>in imped inth thelial function<br>potentially due to increased oxidative<br>stress we recommended that in reducing<br>the intake of saturated dietary fats<br>particular attention should be paid to<br>reducing the fast food intake these<br>interesting results regarding the<br>potential adverse effects of oxidative<br>St stress led us to our next area of<br>research interest vitamin and<br>antioxidant supplements to improve<br>endothelial<br>function kidney transplantation provides<br>an important Improvement in quality of<br>life for<br>recipients but despite this they have a<br>persistently elevated risk of<br>cardiovascular disease transplant<br>recipients have impaired endothelial<br>function and increased levels of<br>oxidative<br>stress Vitamin C can scavenge super<br>oxide and improve endothelial<br>dysfunction we therefore undertook a<br>study to determine whether vitamin C<br>could improve endothelial function in<br>persons after kidney<br>transplantation we enrolled 13 renal<br>transplant recipients in this study they<br>were fasted overnight and treated with<br>either two grams of vitamin C on one<br>occasion or a matching Placebo in random<br>order on the other occasion we assessed<br>flow flow mediated dilation of the<br>brachial artery before and 2 hours after<br>treatment with the vitamin<br>C the subjects as were expected because<br>of their increased cardiovascular risk<br>had impaired Baseline endothelial<br>function shown here in yellow at less<br>than 2% and there was no change as<br>expected with the<br>placebo however after vitamin C there<br>was a significant three-fold Improvement<br>to near normal levels of approximately<br>5% in these persons we concluded that<br>short-term Improvement and endothelial<br>function with vitamin C may be secondary<br>to a reduction in oxidative stress<br>however to date there is no improved<br>outcome data to support chronic<br>treatment with Vitamin C in this group<br>of<br>patients is there evidence to suggest<br>vitamin supplements and antioxidant<br>therapies are of any benefit at all<br>many persons in the community believe<br>that there is<br>benefit and they're prepared to pay for<br>it you're all aware of this at the local<br>health food shop multiple uh supplements<br>of many types are available now there is<br>a theoretical scientific basis for<br>considering that treatment with<br>supplementary antioxidants may protect<br>against oxidative stress and therefore<br>reduce the risk of cardiovascular<br>disease however there have been<br>extensive studies of very various<br>vitamin supplements and a metaanalysis<br>of studies including approximately a<br>quarter of a million randomized persons<br>and they've shown a consistent message<br>no benefit in terms of reduced<br>cardiovascular risk nor<br>mortality perhaps of even more concern<br>supplements with betacarotene and<br>vitamin E have shown evidence of<br>increased<br>mortality interestingly this information<br>uh which was widely disseminated in the<br>public Arena has no particular impact uh<br>supplements and next area of antioxidant<br>research related to Wine intake which<br>may be of interest to many of<br>you it has been suggested that regular<br>moderate consumption of wine and in<br>particular red wine may be associated<br>with a lower risk of cardiovascular<br>disease there is debate as to whether<br>the protective effect relates to the<br>alcohol content of the wine or to the<br>high levels of antioxidant flavor found<br>in some red wine we therefore undertook<br>a study to evaluate the effect of red or<br>white wine on endothelial function in 14<br>men with stable coronary artery<br>disease after a standard light meal low<br>in<br>antioxidants participants had fasted<br>overnight they were randomized to either<br>cordial as a control or approximately<br>half a bottle of red or white wine over<br>Street<br>party flow mediat dilation was assessed<br>just before and at 1 and 6 hours after<br>beverage<br>intake this graph illustrates that a<br>baseline the participants as expected as<br>they all had coronary artery disease had<br>impaired flow mediated dilation at less<br>than<br>2% there was no particular change in fmd<br>at 60 minutes with any of the beverages<br>and no change at 360 minutes with red<br>cordial which is indicated by the Open<br>Circle however there was a definite<br>Improvement in endothelial function with<br>both red and white wine with no<br>difference at all between the<br>wines we therefore concluded that wine<br>of either type acutely improved<br>endothelial function and that this may<br>contribute to the reduced risk of<br>cardiovascular events seen with moderate<br>there is also good evidence across<br>multiple studies that moderate alcohol<br>consumption is associated with a lower<br>risk of Cory heart disease and this<br>graph shows the risk of coronary<br>disease graphed against the number of<br>drinks standard drinks per day and you<br>can see that the lowest risk is in the<br>area of two to three standard drinks per<br>day lower than t total is however once<br>you go over that amount there's a steep<br>increase in cardiovascular<br>risk many ecological Studies have<br>suggested that wine is more effective at<br>reducing the risk of mortality from<br>heart disease than beer or Spirits<br>however there are significant<br>confounding problems with this type of<br>study including cultural differences the<br>best evidence suggests there are no<br>substantial differences between wine<br>beer or spirits and their cardiovascular<br>effects in other words the effect is<br>probably due to the alcohol content<br>rather than the contents of the<br>particular drink<br>in most countries the cardiovascular<br>benefits of moderate drinking are easily<br>outweighed by the adverse effect size of<br>alcohol which at present is similar to<br>smoking we then turned our focus of<br>research to the potential antioxidant<br>effects of garlic garlic has a very long<br>history of use as a medicinal you can<br>see illustrations from the ancient<br>Egyptians of garlic bulbs being used uh<br>for good health he garlic was used<br>widely in ancient China and is mentioned<br>in EA Papyrus a scroll of about 20 M<br>long giving treatments for various<br>illnesses numbering up to 32 with garlic<br>a poates was familiar with garlic and<br>reported its use as a<br>diuretic garlic has been a trusted<br>remedy during epidemics during the<br>Middle Ages it contains Allison and<br>other garlic compounds which have been<br>shown to to lower blood pressure and<br>blood<br>lipids there is evidence that aged<br>garlic extract can decrease oxidation<br>and inflammatory factors and slow the<br>development of experimental<br>atherosclerosis we therefore designed a<br>study to assess the effect of aged<br>garlic extract on endothelial function<br>in 15 men with stable coronary disease<br>you can imagine it's easier to recruit<br>into a study with aged garlic extract<br>than taking a clo of garlic every day<br>and impossible to Placebo control with<br>garlic<br>cloves they were randomized in a placebo<br>controlled trial to four capsules of age<br>garlic extract for a period of 2 weeks<br>or crossed over to a matching<br>Placebo flow mediated dilation was<br>assessed before and after the 2E<br>treatment period there was absolutely no<br>effect of placebo on endothelial<br>function this graph shows the median<br>flow mediated dilation at<br>Baseline in all participants was for .3%<br>and that after 2 weeks treatment it had<br>improved to<br>6.2% most of the Improvement occurred in<br>the men who had impaired flow mediation<br>dilation at<br>Baseline we concluded short-term<br>treatment with age garlic extract<br>improved endothelial function in men<br>with coronary artery<br>disease however any other benefits on<br>cardiovascular risk remain more or less<br>unknown despite these favorable<br>preliminary results there is no<br>conclusive evidence that garlic reduces<br>cardiovascular mortality in patients<br>with cardiovascular disease there is<br>also no convincing evidence that garlic<br>reduces cardiovascular mortality when<br>used as a treatment for high blood<br>pressure or elevated cholesterol<br>levels and now wish to turn to the topic<br>of Cardiology which addresses the second<br>major reason for reductions in<br>cardiovascular<br>mortality Cardiology has made major<br>contributions to better treatments for<br>cardiovascular<br>disease it takes its origin from the<br>Greek cardia for heart and logia for<br>study it's a subsp specialty of internal<br>medicine which is concerned with the<br>medical diagnosis and treatment of<br>coronary artery disease and many other<br>cardiovascular<br>disorders the development of Cardiology<br>has generally been based on scientific<br>discovery of the pathophysiology of<br>cardiovascular disease and on the basis<br>of this knowledge Innovative therapies<br>have been<br>developed many of our modern Cardiology<br>treatment regimes have often been based<br>on large randomized Placebo control<br>clinical trials so that we have a firm<br>evidence base for our<br>treatments once therapies are introduced<br>into practice it is part of our<br>important role to audit the results to<br>ensure the treatment is effective and<br>has translated usefully into real world<br>practice the birth of Cardiology is<br>credited to William Harvey who was an<br>English physician who first defined<br>defined the function of the heart he<br>graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from<br>Cambridge in<br>1597 traveled through Europe and then<br>enrolled under the great anatomists at<br>the University of Padua graduating<br>doctor of medicine in<br>16002 now before the time of Harvey and<br>the development uh of his description of<br>the circulatory system the views of<br>galin held sway this dated back to him<br>being a Greek physician and philosopher<br>he believed that blood traveled between<br>the ventricles through invisible pores<br>and that the Venus and arterial<br>circulations were otherwise completely<br>separated demoto Cordis on the motion of<br>the heart and blood was published in<br>1628 and has 17 chapters which give a<br>perfectly clear and connected account of<br>the action of the heart and the<br>consequent movement of the blood around<br>the body in a<br>circuit Harvey stated it has been shown<br>by reason and experiment that by the<br>beat of the ventricles blood flows<br>through the lungs and it is pumped to<br>the whole body there it passes through<br>pores and the flesh into the veins<br>through which it returns from the<br>periphery finally coming to the venne<br>Cava and right<br>Oracle it must then be concluded that<br>the blood in the animal body moves<br>around in a circle continuously and that<br>the action or function of the heart is<br>to accomplish this by pumping this is<br>the only reason for the motion and beat<br>of the<br>heart further developments in cardiology<br>exhilerated in the 20th<br>century einthoven was a Dutch doctor and<br>physiologist and he invented the first<br>practical electrocardiogram or ECG in<br>1903 receiving the Nobel Prize for his<br>work in<br>1924 the ECG remains one of our most<br>commonly used diagnostic tools in<br>cardiology and is still used to diagnose<br>an acute heart attack every day in our<br>clinical<br>practice wner Forman was a German Doctor<br>Who was the first to insert a catheter<br>into the living human heart in the best<br>traditions of self-<br>experimentation he specifically<br>ignored uh the advice of his Department<br>chief and antiz his own lower arm in the<br>elbow region inserted a catheter into<br>the vein he then walked some distance to<br>the x-ray department on the floor below<br>where under the guidance of an x-ray<br>screening he Advanced the catheter up<br>the arm the full 60 cm into his own<br>right<br>atrium this was then recorded on x-ray<br>film showing the catheter lying in the<br>right atrium of the<br>heart he was awarded a joint Nobel Prize<br>in 1956 for this work regrettably he was<br>dismissed from his Hospital 7 to8 months<br>after his first catheterizing ation in a<br>dispute with Hospital<br>changed Mason SS was an American<br>physician whose pioneering work in<br>cardiac catheterization was instrumental<br>in the development of both coronary<br>artery bypass graph surgery and<br>Interventional Cardiology he was<br>performing an injection of dye into the<br>aort the first Mage blood vessel above<br>the left ventricle the pumping chamber<br>when serendipitously the catheter<br>entered a coronary artery and D was<br>injected outlining the coronary artery<br>and giving cardiologists accurate<br>pictures of arterial blockages for the<br>first<br>times many individuals have made<br>significant contributions here in Eden<br>sir Horus smirk was appointed as the<br>first Mary Glend Denning professor of<br>medicine at the University of atago in<br>1940 he described the electrical<br>precipitant of ventricular fibrillation<br>in 1949 he worked with colleagues and<br>developed the importance of Basil blood<br>pressure as a determinant of prognosis<br>there was little in the way of active<br>treatment of hypertension at that time<br>he developed the hypertension clinic at<br>denen hospital in 1949 which became the<br>first modern Outpatient Clinic for<br>hypertension and in 1950 published his<br>findings of the successful treatment of<br>hypertension with subcutaneous<br>injections of methonium compounds<br>incredibly intensive patients needing to<br>come in and having<br>calibrated injections uh of these drugs<br>to bring their blood pressure down with<br>marvelous<br>results in 1956 John Hunter was<br>appointed as a lecturer at the itaga<br>medical<br>school he went on to become a senior<br>lecturer and the second Mary glanding<br>professor of medicine from 1962 to 196<br>to<br>1993 he used his cardiological skills<br>and knowledge for the benefit of many<br>patients in the South he founded the<br>Cardiology Department of the Atara<br>District Health board established<br>cardiac catheterization and developed<br>one of the country's first coronary care<br>units in<br>1967 he also made significant<br>contributions in the area of cholesterol<br>and lipids and their relationship to<br>cardiovascular<br>disease through the 1960s patients who<br>had a heart attack were admitted to<br>hospital given morphine for their pain<br>and then bed rest for 4 to 6<br>weeks Ted NY developed a program of<br>carefully supervised exercise for men<br>post heart attack after screening with a<br>bicycle exercise test the initial<br>therapies consisted of graded exercises<br>and subsequently use of the hospital<br>pool the participants responded well and<br>a many case had facilitation of a more<br>rapid return to normal physical<br>functioning the patients then and set up<br>the Phoenix Club which continues to the<br>stay supporting members with heart<br>disease Dame nor moreso was trained in<br>both adult in pediatric cardiology and<br>introduced systematic pediatric cardiio<br>catheterization at denen hospital Dame<br>Norma became the second head of the<br>Cardiology Department in<br>1973 in 1967 the first coronary artery<br>bypass graft operation was performed at<br>the Cleveland Clinic and the denan<br>hospital cardiac surgical unit opened in<br>1973 with Professor Pat moloy as the<br>first<br>director in 1977 the first coronary<br>balloon anoplasty was was performed by<br>Andreas grunig and<br>Zurich the first balloon enery plasty in<br>New Zealand was performed by Dr Michael<br>ablet at denan hospital in May<br>1981 coronary artery stin were first<br>developed internationally in 1986 and<br>associate professor Jerry Wilkins in<br>inserted the first coronary stin in New<br>Zealand in 1990 at denan<br>hospital over many years the clinicians<br>of the denan hospital Cardiology<br>Department have proven to be early users<br>of new techniques aiming to improve<br>patient management in 2008 the<br>Cardiology Department were the first who<br>has a group decided to make a wholesale<br>change to a predominant radial artery<br>approach for cardiac<br>catheterization presently we perform 90%<br>95% of our catheterization procedures<br>via the radial artery during<br>2008 We performed an audit of our<br>results in the year that we changed in<br>in that year 165 procedures were<br>performed by the femoral approach which<br>is via the femoral artery at the top of<br>the<br>leg we had a complication rate that<br>would be typical of approximately 5%<br>including injury to the arteries or<br>blood transfusions required because of<br>ongoing bleeding in the over 800<br>patients who had their procedures<br>performed by the radial artery which is<br>the artery in your<br>wrist there were only two<br>relatively minor complications a 95%<br>reduction with the change to this<br>technique this study illustrates the<br>major changes or relatively simple<br>changes that can be made clinically to<br>improve patient<br>outcome what about that major clinical<br>contribution to the reduction of<br>mortality that I discussed<br>earlier if we look at this study we're<br>able to quantitate which factors are<br>most important in reducing<br>cardiovascular mortality and it's clear<br>that<br>revascularization produces the largest<br>reduction in risk and this generally is<br>by coronary anoplasty and stance or a<br>smaller proportion of patients having<br>coronary artery bypass graph surgery the<br>next most significant treatment modality<br>is treatment with a Statin or<br>cholesterol lowering drug followed by<br>anticlotting drugs cardiac<br>there has been a marked reduction in<br>hospital mortality after heart attack at<br>Denon Hospital professor John Hunter<br>reported a mortality of 26% in the early<br>60s when treatment largely consisted of<br>bed rest for four to 6<br>weeks so one in four persons admitted to<br>hospital didn't leave the hospital after<br>a heart attack at that<br>time Dame Norma reso prospectively<br>collected audit data for several decades<br>and this showed a steady decline in<br>mortality from 18 down to 16% introduced<br>which was influenced by the introduction<br>of aspirin and blood clot dissolving<br>drugs from the 21st century mortality<br>has been further reduced by coronary<br>anoplasty and stenting as a primary<br>treatment for acute heart<br>attack I will now describe the current<br>treatment for a patient presenting to<br>the needen hospital with an acute heart<br>attack after an initial brief assessment<br>the patient is transfer referred to the<br>cardiac catheterization<br>laboratory this facility is staed 24<br>hours a day by an on call Specialist<br>Team consisting of two specialist<br>cardiac nurses a cardiac<br>physiologist medical radiation<br>technologist and<br>cardiologist the patient is first<br>treated with Aspirin anticlotting drugs<br>and blood<br>thinners they then placed in the cardiac<br>catheterization laboratory on an X-ray<br>table and using just local anesthetic a<br>needle Illustrated here is used to<br>puncture the small radial artery at the<br>wrist which has a diameter of<br>approximately 2 mm a sheath and here is<br>a sheath lying here is which is a short<br>tube of plastic approximately 2 millim<br>in diameter similar to the artery is<br>introduced into the radial<br>artery and this illustration shows the<br>sheath uh with the patient's arm going<br>up that way and you can see that the<br>sheath has a valve and through this<br>valve cut it catheters are passed up the<br>arm vessels to the<br>heart the cardiac catheters themselves<br>are approximately 1 M long tubes and the<br>cardiologist stands beside the patient<br>looking at a screen Guided by x-ray<br>catheters I'm now going to show a series<br>of<br>illustrations uh of an actual uh person<br>presenting to our Hospital uh with an<br>acute heart attack<br>the tubing here is the catheter and this<br>is x-ray D which has been in injected<br>into the coronary artery normally this<br>artery should run right down the front<br>of the heart to the Apex you can see an<br>Abrupt cut off here of X-ray die and<br>this is because there is a blood clot<br>uding The Vessel and there is ongoing<br>damage to the muscle because of a lack<br>of blood<br>supply the first step of the procedure<br>is to thread a very delicate guide wire<br>about a third of a millimeter and size<br>through the area of blockage and along<br>the<br>vessel along the wire and here is a<br>picture of a coronary wire a long cathet<br>over about 1.7 mm diameter is passed<br>into the area of the clot you can see<br>that there's an aspiration looming and<br>negative pressure or a vacuum is applied<br>and the clot is sucked from the heart<br>artery and here's a specimen container<br>and these are are the actual stringy<br>lengths of clot that have been removed<br>from inside that<br>artery immediately afterwards when we<br>put further x-ray contrast down the<br>artery you can see a markedly improved<br>appearance with blood flow now down to<br>the apex of the heart however there is<br>still some irregularity related to<br>persistent atherosclerotic narrowing<br>Andor clot which requires further<br>optimization<br>this is achieved by implantation of a<br>coronary stent the coronary stent is<br>again passed down the same guide wire<br>and consists of a metal lattice work<br>balloon you can see here the coronary<br>stent which is indicated by markers the<br>beginning and the far end of the stin is<br>being positioned across the area of<br>irregularity and is then inflated into<br>position<br>leaving a nice smooth parallel sized<br>vessel after completion of the<br>procedure this takes 30 to 40 minutes to<br>uh perform the results of this fast and<br>effective treatment mean that after an<br>early presentation there is a marked<br>reduction in the degree of heart muscle<br>damage patients are usually discharged<br>from hospital after 3 days and return to<br>normal physical functioning within 1 to<br>two weeks this represents a major<br>Advance compared to the early treatment<br>of heart attack<br>the data I have just shown may give the<br>impression that the battle against<br>cardiovascular disease is one and that<br>there is little left to<br>achieve unfortunately this is far from<br>the actual State of Affairs we have a<br>new epidemic in New Zealand<br>obesity this is a worldwide phenomenon<br>and is expected to adversely affect<br>cardiovascular mortality in the<br>future it is a wide public interest<br>there wouldn't be a week go by that a<br>headline such as this doesn't appear in<br>the ODT the New Zealand Medical<br>Association has written a special policy<br>briefing because of the huge concerns<br>about the long-term effects and in<br>particular cardiovascular disease is a<br>concern at the present time only 30 to<br>40% of new zealanders are of normal<br>weight related to this increasing<br>prevalence of obesity there is actually<br>a potential for a decline and life<br>expectancy in the 21st century we may<br>not continue to see this reduction in<br>mortality if obesity prevalence<br>increases and we have the expected<br>long-term adverse cardiovascular effects<br>this study shows life expectancy<br>influence with a reduction in life<br>expectancy for persons who are<br>moderately obese and a Severe reduction<br>in life expectancy for those who are<br>markedly obese in this group life<br>expectancy may be decreased by between 8<br>and 10 years which is a Quantum similar<br>to that scene with cigarette<br>smoking for every increase in two of the<br>body mass index there is an Associated<br>decrease in life expectancy of about one<br>year we therefore still face<br>considerable challenges to combat this<br>epidemic before the fight against<br>cardiovascular disease is<br>one I have been fortunate to have<br>experienced an exciting research and<br>clinical career in the field of<br>Cardiology over the last 25 years what<br>is quite evident however to me is that<br>the progress achieved here in denen has<br>been a result of the work of a close-nit<br>team many of whom are present in this<br>departmental photograph from the<br>1990s teamwork has also been an<br>important part of our research program<br>and I wish to acknowledge all my<br>research collaborators over the years<br>especially Wayne Southerland Greg Jones<br>and Sy<br>McCormack the research technicians<br>including Marie McCormack and David yman<br>were an integral part of the endothelial<br>function<br>research the Cardiology Department<br>research nurses have played an essential<br>role in conducting our research studies<br>and I'm very grateful to them I wish to<br>thank my cardiologist colleagues for<br>their support with research projects<br>over the year and particularly Jerry<br>Wilkins who has provided long-term<br>support for our local research<br>studies I'm grateful to the staff of the<br>cardiac catheterization laboratory at<br>denan hospital for their great work in<br>both the research and clinical<br>areas I have found it a personal<br>pleasure to work with the cardiac<br>physiologists and the nursing staff of<br>the coronary care unit and Cardiology<br>Ward at Den Eden<br>Hospital finally I wish to thank my wife<br>Fiona for her support she has been the<br>core of our family and kept family<br>activities going while I have been away<br>from home working I'm delighted that my<br>three lovely daughters are all here<br>tonight and I would like to thank them<br>mother I also wish to acknowledge uh my<br>parents my brother and sister and their<br>families who have attended to support me<br>this<br>evening thank you very much for your<br>attention<br>good evening my name is Rob Walker and<br>I'm the current Mary glendening chair of<br>medicon and it's my very great pleasure<br>firstly to congratulate Michael on his<br>personal chair and also acknowledge what<br>a fantastic talk we've had today a very<br>thorough rendition of our history of<br>medicine and particularly Cardiology in<br>denan but also the contributions that<br>Cardiology has made to the worldwide<br>area of Cardiology now Michael's only<br>touched on a very small part of some of<br>the research areas he's done he has a<br>very strong translational component as<br>he mentioned working with Greg and Sally<br>in particular down at the beach down to<br>the bedside and back up again so he's<br>very well versed in many areas of<br>research and contributes very actively<br>to our<br>department he's one of the key members<br>of the Heart atago Group with some of<br>the colleagues that he's mentioned and I<br>would hope that in the next year that<br>that may also become another research<br>theme that the Department of Medicine<br>co-hosts with some of the other research<br>themes that we do have to carry on this<br>excellent<br>work so as a small token of our<br>gratitude for such a fantastic talk just<br>a little gift on behalf of the school in<br>the University of tago to recognize<br>tonight's event so congratulations and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
