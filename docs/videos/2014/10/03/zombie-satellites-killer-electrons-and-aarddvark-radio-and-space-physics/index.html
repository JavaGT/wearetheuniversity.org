University of itago and I<br>would like to warmly welcome you to the<br>first IPL of<br>2014 now those of you who attend these<br>um lectures regularly will know that I<br>often remark that it is my favorite part<br>of the day um it is still the F my<br>favorite part of the day in<br>2014 um because it is the one time that<br>we all take a break from the busyness of<br>our lives here at the University and<br>simply spend an hour celebrating the<br>accomplishments of our<br>own now this university has the great<br>Fortune of being able to attract the<br>best and the brightest academic staff<br>from all over the world but sometimes<br>the best and brightest are actually<br>found in our own<br>backyard and Craig is a prime example of<br>a homegrown uh success story here at the<br>University of<br>itago in addition to Craig's illustrious<br>academic career here um his family also<br>has a long history with the University<br>of itago and I would like to warmly um<br>welcome Craig's parents Stan and an uh<br>who are here proudly celebrating with<br>Craig this evening um Craig's father The<br>Honorable Stan Roger actually worked<br>here at the University of atago when he<br>retired from Parliament he's worked at<br>the faculty of dentistry and the faculty<br>of medicine he's chaired the university<br>Union limited and genomics limited and<br>he continues to be in fact even last<br>week a very important and critical<br>friend uh to this University when we<br>need him and we are incredibly grateful<br>to that for that<br>Stan um Craig's mother Anne um actually<br>studied here at the University of atago<br>like Craig um she was awarded a<br>certificate in social work in 1984 and a<br>dip grad in<br>1996 I personally have had the great<br>pleasure of being a guest at the Rogers<br>home um and I know that many of you have<br>also shared that incredible uh adventure<br>with Stan at the barbecue um<br>and we are really really pleased um to<br>have you remain part of the University<br>of itago<br>family now Craig is the man of the honor<br>uh of the hour here tonight and we are<br>all here to honor him um and fortunately<br>many of his mentors and his<br>collaborators are here to share in his<br>success now it goes without saying that<br>the promotion to Professor uh is one<br>that is marked by outstanding research<br>achievements um and Craig is certainly<br>no exception to that rule um I had a<br>quick look over his CV today before<br>preparing my remarks and I lost count um<br>after 130 Publications um so he has C<br>certainly um well and truly earned uh<br>his professorial stripes in terms of<br>research but like so many other<br>extremely successful researchers here at<br>itago Craig's passion for his science<br>also spills into his<br>classroom um and in fact even outside<br>the classroom because the last time I<br>bumped into Craig before this evening he<br>was actually giving a lecture um outside<br>on the Le near the Le um outside the<br>registry so clearly not even the<br>boundaries um of a CL class are going to<br>be able to contain his enthusiasm for<br>physics in short Craig you have well and<br>truly earned this promotion to Professor<br>um and we all look forward to learning<br>more about your work uh in a moment but<br>before we give you the chance to tell us<br>about your work um I would like to hand<br>over to Keith Hunter who is the pro Vice<br>Chancellor of science who is going to<br>share with us a few more details about<br>Craig's academic history<br>thank you Vice Chancellor and um I share<br>her sentiments with regard to the guests<br>that are here um today you're all most<br>welcome um I have given many of these<br>introductions and I'm proud of that<br>because it shows that we have so many<br>good people in the university and in The<br>Sciences so Craig was born in Wellington<br>and he grew grew up and was educated in<br>denen and Wellington and came to the<br>University of tago in 1990 to study<br>Physics and he graduated with first<br>class honors a few years later four<br>years later on the way he's collected a<br>impressive array of<br>awards including the inaugural hatherton<br>award for the best science<br>paper um at the end of his<br>PhD he was<br>then wondering what to do with his life<br>and um so he thought he might like to<br>work for the Met service which was<br>probably a very honorable thing uh to<br>think and so he went off and got<br>interviewed by the Met service and um<br>they uh did a psychometric analysis of<br>his<br>personality and I think the words were<br>that he was considered to be quite<br>interesting and different from the<br>normal people who applied for a job at<br>the Met service but then he didn't get<br>the job<br>and it wasn't until later that he<br>discovered that his referee Professor<br>Dick dalon had indicated very clearly to<br>available Craig had a<br>um a couple of<br>scholarships and um so he came here to<br>do a PhD understandably under dick<br>Daron at the end of that he um was<br>awarded a New Zealand Science and<br>Technology post doctor Fellowship which<br>he took up for two years at the um<br>British Antarctic Survey in<br>Cambridge and um he still continues to<br>collaborate with that<br>group uh and he then returned to um<br>dened because Dick Darden had picked up<br>a Marsen Grant and so Craig got employed<br>on that Marsen Grant and when that<br>finished the physics department decided<br>that they needed to keep Craig around so<br>they hired<br>to develop and teach a summer school<br>paper which uh which is still running<br>now and this was followed by year after<br>year of one-year contracts until<br>eventually um Craig the department I<br>think saw the year of its ways and<br>offered him a job and he got a maren<br>FAST startart program since then he's<br>been awarded a full maren ground in his<br>own right as principal investigator and<br>also a very substantial award from the<br>European Union<br>fp7<br>scheme uh and these grants are still<br>operating he was awarded the University<br>of atago early career award for<br>distinction and research in 2004 and in<br>2011 a university of atago excellence<br>and teaching award and there are not<br>many staff who get both Awards so I<br>think that um means really that you're<br>in for a treat today um of course<br>Craig's had a number of interesting jobs<br>as you can see and he wasn't always<br>aspiring to do physics and in fact<br>during his<br>PhD PhD students often need to earn<br>extra money so Craig got a job as a<br>telecom<br>Center so and you would have agree with<br>me that he's ideally qualified for such<br>a job um but he had to sit on the throne<br>and answer questions and pretend to be<br>Center so all joking aside Craig my<br>congratulations on your richly deserved<br>promotion to professor and I invite you<br>address okay ladies and gentlemen thank<br>you very much for coming tonight to my<br>inaugural professorial lecture I am so<br>pleased and proud to be able to talk to<br>you today and to do my thing in front of<br>a full class now first of all I have to<br>make a comment I have been asked not to<br>use the stick okay so for those of you<br>who are used to me in first year classes<br>doing my thing I won't be doing using<br>the stick but I will be moving around a<br>lot so for the gentleman who is videoing<br>this<br>sorry I will be moving around a lot uh<br>but we won't be using the stick to point<br>out things we need to use the mouse<br>pointer okay so we'll do our best to try<br>and make everything work in the high<br>technology world that we now live<br>in I want to talk to you about my<br>research some of the finer details but<br>also why we think what we are doing is<br>important the story goes back to<br>1958 in 1958 the United States launched<br>the first American satellite into orbit<br>Explorer one and it carried the first<br>scientific experiment into space but<br>because it was the first satellite that<br>experiment had to be very very simple it<br>was a Geer counter it went click when<br>ionizing radiation went by it very<br>simple experiment they launched it into<br>space to study cosmic rays coming from<br>deep space and found something totally<br>unexpected as you almost always do when<br>you go visit somewhere for the first<br>time they put the Gea counter up into<br>space and the instrument went crazy when<br>it got outside of the atmosphere<br>and they discovered to their huge<br>surprise that space was<br>radioactive the quote from the PHD<br>student when they realized why the<br>instrument was going nuts they<br>discovered what we now term the<br>radiation belts the Van Allen radiation<br>belts which are a set of Trapped high<br>energy electrons and<br>protons ah no that's right this one<br>trapped in the Earth's magnetic field<br>and they're called the Van Allen<br>radiation belts because van alen was the<br>scientist who was the pi on the Gaga<br>counter it turns out when you go back to<br>this very first experiment in<br>1958 right at the dawn of the Space Age<br>we start with a very International<br>grouping of scientists there are the<br>three scientists who ran the program<br>together holding aoft a onetoone scale<br>model of Explorer one it wasn't very big<br>and that is Bill Pickering James Van<br>Allen and Verna Von Brown Bill Pickering<br>being a New Zealander studied at the<br>University of Canterbury and then went<br>off to Caltech to continue his work and<br>became the director of the jet<br>propulsion laboratory so right at the<br>beginning New Zealand had a connection<br>to this<br>work in the more than 50 years since<br>we've discovered a great deal about the<br>radiation belt but it is reasonable for<br>you to be surprised that there are still<br>fundamental<br>unknowns associated with the physics<br>operating inside the radiation belts and<br>that's where myself and my colleagues<br>have been working in for possibly the<br>last 5 or 10 years if you look at the<br>basic structure of the radiation belts<br>they're like a doughnut surrounding the<br>earth so you have the Earth there is the<br>magnetic field around the earth and<br>there are charged particles and a donut<br>around the earth there is a formation of<br>an inner belt and an outer belt we tend<br>to focus on the outer belt that is<br>stronger now this is the sort of typical<br>average picture that we tend to paint<br>but that's that doesn't capture the<br>dynamic nature of the the radiation<br>belts the radiation belts are not like<br>this they're like this they're<br>constantly in motion they're constantly<br>changing over time scales of hours to<br>days the flux of particles the number of<br>particles in the radiation belt changes<br>by orders of magnitude which is physics<br>talk for 10 100 a th000 maybe 10,000<br>times the number of particles changes in<br>the radiation belts inside a few hours<br>and the question that we're trying to<br>ask when we're interested in radiation<br>belt physics is why do they change so<br>much now first of all the source of the<br>dynamism this massive change primarily<br>comes from the sun when you think about<br>the sun you don't think about the Sun as<br>being very<br>changeable because okay the sun comes up<br>the sun goes down the sun comes up the<br>sun goes down but it shines at a<br>constant amount all the time and that is<br>really close to being true the total<br>energy output from the Sun hardly<br>changes<br>but the outer surface of the Sun is very<br>very very hot it is so hot that the<br>outer gases in the outer part of the<br>sun's atmosphere are boiled off into<br>space so you take the massive<br>gravitational attraction of the sun and<br>the surface of the Sun is so hot you can<br>still boil the gases away out into space<br>and they travel out in all directions<br>away from the Sun forming what we call<br>the solar wind which is a gentle<br>breeze that wafts past the Earth at<br>about 450 km a<br>second when things are<br>quiet okay but every now and again the<br>sun becomes more Dynamic so here is a<br>movie which will work yes so we've<br>pointed a camera at the Sun but we've<br>put a thing over the front of the camera<br>to block out the sun itself cuz it's so<br>bright and it's on a little arm and you<br>can see the arm holding the blocky thing<br>in place and by doing that you can see<br>the glowing GES coming from the Sun and<br>when you look at this movie you can see<br>every now and again and when you look at<br>this<br>movie you can see every now and again<br>that there are explosions coming from<br>the Sun there's one<br>boom and the best one of these as far as<br>I'm concerned are Earth<br>directed and it works a bit like this<br>imagine I am pointing a shotgun at you<br>when I pull the trigger you will briefly<br>see a ring of shot coming at<br>you expanding outwards if you put a<br>satellite out into space and point it at<br>the sun when you see what they call a<br>full<br>Halo that mean the sun has<br>launched millions of tons of matter<br>exploding outwards into space towards<br>the Earth and when that crashes into the<br>Earth's magnetic field and all the<br>energy exchanges that take place we end<br>up with large increases and decreases in<br>the flux of particles it all starts from<br>the Sun exactly how is still a proper<br>research question but we know it starts<br>with the<br>sun done that<br>but<br>okay inside the radiation belt Community<br>we tend to be very strongly focused on<br>what are called killer<br>electrons now let me be completely<br>upfront with you we do not go to<br>conferences and say let's talk to each<br>other about killer electrons this is a<br>term used for public consumption<br>cuz it sounds cool but it is actually<br>actually accurate the most high energy<br>electrons one million electron volts are<br>or greater which are very highly<br>relativistic which is just physics speak<br>again very high energy electrons are<br>capable of going through the walls of<br>satellites to get to the delicate<br>Electronics inside and once they get in<br>there and zap those Electronics well who<br>knows what will happen maybe nothing<br>maybe your satellite will just get a bit<br>confused briefly maybe it will forget<br>how to talk to Earth by zapping that<br>vital bit of memory maybe it will just<br>go and die and we don't have the ability<br>to go up and repair<br>it so they're killer electrons and this<br>is one of the reasons why people are so<br>interested in the radiation belts<br>because many many satellites live inside<br>the radiation belt if you take the outer<br>radiation belt here the standard orbit<br>for GS synchronous satellites passes<br>right through the outer radiation belts<br>which are both very big sorry very<br>strong very high fluxes but also highly<br>variable up and down and up and down and<br>if you're an engineer and you want to<br>build a satellite that will last 5 10<br>years cuz it cost a lot of money to get<br>it there so you want it to last for a<br>long time once it's got there you would<br>like to know what radiation dose it will<br>have over its life and if the numbers<br>keep going up and down and up and down<br>it's very difficult for you to work out<br>what that radiation dose will be so this<br>is one of the reasons why we study these<br>orbits let's study the radiation builds<br>if you look at the geostationary<br>spacecraft there's roughly<br>450 active satellites in geostationary<br>orbit today doing communication during<br>navigation doing weather observations in<br>New Zealand people often go tramping and<br>take um search and rescue beacons with<br>them which they set off they often talk<br>to satellites sometimes orbit sometimes<br>do stationary they're a really vital<br>part of our modern<br>technology and they're very<br>expensive a typical satellite in today's<br>money is between 200 and 300 million<br>us roughly 100 to2 200 million to build<br>it and then $1 100 million to put it on<br>the biggest firor you can imagine and<br>throw it up into space and then you<br>leave it there for as long as it lasts<br>let me give an example of a satellite<br>that we did some work on Galaxy 15<br>communication satellites owned by United<br>States company launched on the 13th of<br>October 2005 by European Aran 5 uh<br>rocket out of French<br>Guana in April 2010 this communication<br>zombie so something happened<br>such that the satellite would no longer<br>obey<br>constructions it was<br>broadcasting loudly on all channels and<br>drifting in orbit around the world<br>interfering with all the other<br>satellites as it went by causing<br>communication troubles causing other<br>satellites to have to switch off so that<br>they could survive the zombie going by<br>so a small number of years ago my one of<br>my collaborators and I decided to work<br>out what happened why did this happen<br>and we went and looked at what zombified<br>galaxy 15 and we found that right at the<br>time right at the time that the<br>satellite went out of control there was<br>this injection of hot<br>electrons right where it was and we<br>combined a whole lot of observations<br>from groundbased and satellite uh<br>instruments to find out that this<br>particular injection was big it was so<br>big one of my my students showed that<br>only .1% of these sort of events were as<br>big as<br>this and Galaxy 15 was totally in the<br>wrong place when this<br>happened and so it got zombified it<br>wasn't totally lost after um something<br>like five months I think the batteries<br>ran out went to safe mode and they were<br>able to to to reboot it and regain<br>control so that was a happy ending for a<br>zombie<br>spacecraft so they can<br>recover right now how we understand the<br>dynamic changes in the radiation belt<br>the number of particles in the radiation<br>belt depends upon the number you start<br>with plus the number that you give<br>energy to minus the number of particles<br>that you get rid<br>of so the number of particles equals the<br>input minus the<br>output and how does that change with<br>time lots of people for various reasons<br>CU it is actually quite cool Ross the<br>world have been focused on this<br>acceleration term the<br>input my colleagues and I are relatively<br>unusual in that we are<br>losers we focus on the loss side we are<br>interested in the loss of these<br>electrons from the radiation<br>belts one of the reasons that we're<br>interested in this is where they're lost<br>to they're not just lost they don't just<br>go<br>away the dominant loss process es into<br>the atmosphere of the earth and because<br>of the way the magnetic field works<br>these particles are trapped on a<br>magnetic field line which joins to the<br>Earth's atmosphere and these magnetic<br>field lines join to the Earth's<br>atmosphere in the polar regions in the<br>Arctic and the<br>Antarctic thereby forcing us to go to<br>the Antarctic and the Arctic to do our<br>experiments so you know multiple pluses<br>here<br>really let's briefly talk about the<br>fundamental motion of electrons in the<br>radiation belt this is just a little bit<br>of physics but I'm sure you'll be fine<br>okay the dominant motion if you take a<br>Charged particle in a magnetic field it<br>Gates which means it goes round and<br>round and round in the circle okay with<br>the magnetic field line in the middle<br>magnetic field charged particle like an<br>electron goes round and round in a<br>circle a typical radiation belt electron<br>will go around the circle a million<br>times a second so<br>then that electron it turns out is<br>actually hello there<br>bouncing joing joing along the field<br>line back and forth and back and<br>forth that takes about 1 second so it<br>goes from just above the Earth's<br>atmosphere to about 35 30,000 km away<br>from the surface of the Earth and then<br>back again in about a second okay so<br>million times a second 1<br>second then we have the third motion is<br>that the particles drift around the<br>Earth from east from uh west to east if<br>there are electrons and it takes about<br>an hour for a relativistic electron to<br>go once around the earth so that's our<br>motions we<br>express an awful lot of the physics<br>behind a radiation belt electron through<br>a parameter we referred to is the pitch<br>angle this is the bit that I just want<br>you to grasp so we'll do it slowly okay<br>so the pitch angle is the<br>angle the angle that angle there between<br>the velocity Vector that is parallel to<br>the field field line and the velocity<br>Vector that is perpendicular to the<br>field line so if the this angle is<br>90° the particle all of its energy all<br>of its kinetic energy all of its energy<br>of<br>motion is wrapped up and just it's<br>sitting there and it spins it's not<br>bouncing it's just sitting there<br>spinning and it has a 90° pitch angle if<br>it has a0 degree pitch angle all of its<br>kinetic energy is along the field line<br>and it goes<br>zoom and crashes into the atmosphere of<br>the earth so that immediately tells us<br>we have two sorts of electrons that are<br>out there we have electrons which are<br>trapped because they're not going<br>anywhere and we have electrons which<br>will immediately crash into the Earth's<br>in practice there is a population of<br>pitch angles stretching from 90° to<br>0° and the ones that will be lost are<br>not just the ones which have a pitch<br>angle of 0 deg because those ones will<br>hit the<br>ground and if an electron hits the<br>ground it's stuffed but the atmosphere<br>of the earth is so thick like this chunk<br>here that if an electron came down from<br>the sky and touched this chunk of<br>atmosphere as well it would hit part of<br>the atmosphere and it would be lost in<br>practice particles that bounce above 100<br>km altitude<br>live particles that bounce below 100 km<br>altitude die they might get to bounce a<br>couple of times but they're going to<br>have a collision and given a couple of<br>times means a couple of seconds once<br>it's in the pitch angle range such that<br>it touches the atmosphere it's<br>dead this defines a range of pitch<br>angles which we call<br>uh the loss cone the range of pitch<br>angles that will be lost into the<br>atmosphere okay now if you want to try<br>and understand the losses from space<br>into the Earth's atmosphere our first<br>inclination is to put a measuring device<br>on a satellite and put it into space and<br>measure them measure the particles in<br>space that will be hitting the Earth's<br>atmosphere you can imagine it like a<br>bucket you fly a bucket around and just<br>catch the electrons and then count<br>idea at least this sounds like a good<br>idea this is what we originally tried to<br>do and eventually we worked out why it<br>doesn't work so if we have this range<br>the Lost cone what we want to measure is<br>all of that we want to measure just the<br>particles that are inside the L cone and<br>not the particles that are outside the<br>Lost cone we want to measure that what<br>do we get in practice well if you look<br>at a lot of satellites which are out at<br>geostationary orbit the Lost cone gets<br>really narrow just turns out that it's a<br>few degrees wide which makes it not<br>impossible but very very difficult to<br>measure and because it's very very<br>I did go to an ASA panel where somebody<br>was trying to ask for you know $10<br>million to fly one of these and it was<br>so cool but people said well that's<br>difficult it might not work let's use<br>the $10 million for something that's<br>much more likely to<br>work and I couldn't help<br>them another common example we want to<br>measure the particles in the Lost cone<br>it turns out that it is just easier to<br>measure that<br>bit which is frustrating<br>you don't actually need to understand<br>that bit it's just it frustrates me so<br>much that most of the measurements that<br>I can get my hands on are measuring just<br>exactly outside of the Lost cone and<br>then it the United States Noah<br>organization do have some satellites<br>which measure inside the Lost cone but<br>then just to really drive me mad what we<br>that<br>so after much consideration we have come<br>to the conclusion that the satellite way<br>is not the way to go it's cool it gives<br>you context it tells you when stuff is<br>happening and you know as a space<br>physicist when you go to the bar and say<br>yes I'm a rocket scientist there is a<br>certain kudos for that I work with<br>satellite data in practice we have<br>turned the problem on its head remember<br>what I'm interested in is these hot<br>electrons coming out of space and<br>striking the Earth's atmosphere and my<br>problem is how many electrons are coming<br>out of space and I can't fly a bucket to<br>do it but all the electrons that I'm<br>interested in are striking the Earth's<br>atmosphere so if we use the atmosphere<br>as a particle detector we are only going<br>to get the electrons we're interested in<br>we won't get extra ones cuz they don't<br>get there and so we have been working on<br>using the atmosphere as obvious a<br>free so the sort of particles we care<br>about are energetic enough that when<br>they reach down into the atmosphere they<br>deposit their energy between about 50 km<br>altitude and about 80 km altitude so<br>imagine there is some sort of marshing<br>in space with a ray gun going firing<br>particles down into Spa down into the<br>atmosphere now that's not<br>true to the best of my knowledge the<br>Lost processes are not as far as we can<br>tell driven by martians with<br>runs however the effect is not so<br>dissimilar the particles come out of<br>space the energy is deposited and that<br>bit of atmosphere Gets<br>Zapped and when it gets<br>Zapped the energy dis deposition causes<br>that piece of ionosphere to become<br>ionized that piece of atmosphere to<br>become<br>ionized which allows us to bounce radio<br>waves off<br>it so in a technique that is a lot like<br>radar but much<br>cheaper we use radio propagation and the<br>bouncing of radio waves off the<br>ionosphere when the ionosphere Gets<br>Zapped to measure the losses so how do<br>we do<br>it we're building on a very longstanding<br>technique it's a very old technique but<br>for the most part it hasn't been applied<br>to the outer radiation<br>belts we use a man-made Communications<br>transmitter so in a radar system there<br>is a transmitter and a receiver we have<br>both a transmitter and a receiver but<br>the transmitter in our case is not ours<br>it and they're great transmitters<br>they're so powerful but I'll talk to<br>about that in the moment first of all<br>what do we do so the transmitter<br>launches waves in a particular frequency<br>range that is called V LF very low<br>frequency although it's actually about<br>20 khz and I can't talk as high pitched<br>enough to make me sound like I'm 20 khz<br>but it's about 20 khz and that signal<br>it's trapped between the lightly charged<br>part of the osphere which is 85 km at<br>night about 70 km during the day and<br>propagate for thousands of kilometers<br>from the transmitter to a receiver<br>now zap the atmosphere you change the<br>electrical properties of the atmosphere<br>which changes the properties of the<br>radio wave you detect the change<br>properties and the effort is try to<br>understand how that change in the radio<br>waves tells you about this change in the<br>atmosphere which tells you what happened<br>in space so there's a chain we have to<br>go<br>back yes it would be nice if we had the<br>flying<br>bucket okay but we don't have the flying<br>bucket so we have to use this chain now<br>if there's any um if there's any<br>citizens of wealthy countries<br>here military active wealthy countries I<br>need to say thank you because you are<br>paying for these transmitters these<br>transmitters are not used to send<br>messages like music in fact they've got<br>a 200 board<br>um information flow rate which most of<br>you will not remember modems that<br>slow okay they're used to communicate<br>with<br>submarines because of the skin depth<br>effect which is physics thing if you sit<br>just 10 m under the water you can be<br>underwater and people can still talk to<br>you and they can tell you something<br>really important like the world is still<br>here be calm be cool we'll get back to<br>you if there's a problem<br>these are primarily used to communicate<br>with ballistic missile submarines by<br>those powers that have them and because<br>of that they're very powerful they're<br>very uh stable they run all the time<br>they're perfect science tools even if<br>they're used for something else now um<br>just in case you're wondering we don't<br>know what they're saying they encode the<br>messages to the point that we don't know<br>what they're saying they're beautifully<br>encoded occasionally they tell us what<br>they're saying when they're not sending<br>messages they send a lot of baseball<br>scores for the morale of the crew they<br>send sporting information they send<br>occasionally personal messages although<br>we're talking telegram level stuff but<br>you're not completely cut off when<br>you're on a thre month Cruise underwater<br>away from the world but that's<br>irrelevant for us we use them as science<br>tools and so we have built our<br>arv the Antarctic Arctic radiation belt<br>dynamic deposition blf atmospheric<br>research<br>consula a grouping of like-minded<br>scientists who run these VF receivers<br>primarily in the Antarctic and the<br>Arctic to study the energy inputs from<br>space coming into the Earth each one of<br>these red diamonds is one of our<br>receiving stations it's primarily<br>organized and operated by the British<br>Antarctic Survey and Dr Mark cloford<br>and myself from the University ofo but<br>we have many collaborators the<br>University of Olu and Finland uh the<br>Australian Antarctic Division and the<br>University of uh Newcastle in Australia<br>University of Alberta and natural<br>resource Canada and Canada Lancaster<br>University in the UK Antarctica New<br>Zealand Eros University in Hungary and<br>the University of quu natal in South<br>Africa are our main collaborators and we<br>have many receivers scattered around the<br>world the large green dots are those<br>military transmitters that we monitor if<br>we just make the plot a little bit<br>easier to look at you can see this we<br>have this range of stations they're not<br>all at high latitudes it's nice to have<br>measurements in your own backyard for<br>example okay so what do we do with the<br>arbar<br>data<br>well it's tempting to tell you about<br>that but fundamentally it's relatively<br>complicated and there's a whole big<br>story that I want to tell you<br>about and getting into the nitty-gritty<br>details of how arar works is not the way<br>to<br>go I want to tell you why our arvar work<br>is important not just in a space physics<br>context now the most pressing scientific<br>problem facing us today in my opinion<br>and many other<br>people is human induced global global<br>climate<br>change and as a geophysicist even a<br>space physicist<br>I want to make a contribution in this<br>our most important scientific modern<br>problem our most important modern<br>scientific problem it's probably<br>better<br>so the work that we are undertaking is<br>assisting is moving towards trying to<br>better understand natural climate<br>variability because we need to be able<br>to understand the natural climate<br>variability if we are to properly<br>model the contribution that's our fault<br>which is the dominant<br>contribution and predict the future<br>which is really what we're trying to do<br>when will the climate become so bad that<br>we will<br>care is really what the ipcc is trying<br>to answer at what point will we decide<br>something and in order to do that we<br>need to understand the overall<br>variability of the system<br>now you may have heard the suggestion<br>that climate change is due to the<br>suggestion but not by anybody who knows<br>very<br>much okay now I people I know people<br>physicists even who are doubtful that<br>it's our<br>fault but they much like me know very<br>little about the climate and generally<br>they know very little about the<br>sun I am part of a wider international<br>organization with a group of people who<br>specialize in trying to understand the<br>importance of the changing sun on the<br>climate you'd think that would be the<br>group of people who are sure it's not<br>our<br>fault and they're<br>not they argue about is it is the sun's<br>contribution 10% is it 15% is at 5% of<br>the change we're<br>seeing small beer<br>aless are we sure it's our fault<br>yeah we're sure it's our fault to quote<br>the opcc warming of the atmosphere and<br>ocean system is unequivocal and it is<br>extremely likely the human influence has<br>warming I feel like I need to show you<br>that before I start talking about how my<br>space physics stuff can link to the<br>climate cuz it can but it links to<br>climate variability not to long-term<br>change it would be nice if that wasn't<br>true but unfortunately as scientists our<br>hopes and wishes often do not fulfill<br>reality otherwise I could just wish<br>myself another research Grant and a<br>whole lot more papers rather than<br>actually having to do the work and we<br>could all do that wouldn't it be nice<br>anyway a link the climate<br>some of uh the evidence that we're<br>really interesting interested in comes<br>from the work by Eugene<br>rosanov Uh Russian now works in<br>Switzerland he feared a climate<br>chemistry<br>model with uh chemical changes in the<br>atmosphere caused by particle<br>precipitation and he so the loss of<br>particles from space into the atmosphere<br>and he looked at the difference between<br>the model runs that he did when he put<br>the electron input in and when he didn't<br>put the electron input in and he said<br>what's the difference and he found that<br>there was a large change in the warming<br>and cooling patterns that over uh Russia<br>there's a 2° warming over uh North<br>America there's like a half a degree<br>warming in the polar regions there like<br>a half a degree<br>cooling quite important change in uh the<br>temperature patterns which turn out to<br>be a similar magnitude to those caused<br>by solar euv Sol solar ultraviolet<br>observations which is what a lot of the<br>climate people who are interested in<br>on one of our collaborators anaka seppa<br>from Finland went and looked for that<br>signal she took a whole lot of<br>temperature data surface temperature<br>data and sorted it by times when there<br>was lots of particle precipitation<br>electrons coming from space and times<br>that were not and took the difference<br>and found much the same pattern<br>hot hot cool and a very similar and a<br>patent in the Antarctic which turns out<br>was in Eugene's model as well but he<br>didn't publish that<br>but so what we're trying to do now is<br>understanding where this variation<br>variability comes<br>from there is a chain of processes that<br>occur in the atmosphere some of which is<br>chemistry and with apologies to my<br>various chemistry colleagues I'm not a<br>chemist like I'm so close to not being a<br>chemist it's embarrassing<br>so what I have is there is particle<br>precipitation that's the thing this<br>changes the ionization rate in the<br>atmosphere and this produces chemicals<br>which are called odd nitrogen and odd<br>hydrogen odd nitrogen they call nox odd<br>hydrogen they call<br>Hawks these chemicals in my head are<br>Pacman they eat<br>ozone they cause a catalytic reaction to<br>take place which destroys ozone and does<br>not modify their concentration or<br>something I don't know<br>Pacman okay once you've destroyed ozone<br>and upper altitudes ozone absorbs the<br>energy from the Sun particularly the<br>ultraviolet which is why we don't get so<br>much skin cancer as we would if the<br>atmosphere wasn't there shielding us if<br>there is less ozone to absorb you get<br>less heating if you have less heating<br>you have a hot bit that wasn't there and<br>a cold bit that wasn't there and a wind<br>flows and suddenly you've aled the<br>weather<br>patterns that's our<br>that we're trying to see if it works<br>there's lots of evidence that it does<br>but we certainly don't have all of these<br>steps pinned down particularly that one<br>although there is a lot of work taking<br>place so I can show you some evidence<br>that some of this is right if we take<br>arar measurements made by my colleague<br>Neil Thompson when he was on sabatical<br>in<br>Cambridge some years ago where he ran a<br>recording instrument in his bedroom<br>cupboard and from the radio wave<br>measurement ments made on his sabatical<br>we were able to do modeling and extract<br>the input of particles from space into<br>the<br>atmosphere a few years<br>later we then fed that input into a<br>chemistry atmospheric chemistry model to<br>see what happened and we found that<br>there was a 500 to<br>600% increase in the Pacman chemicals I<br>call KNX and that sounds really<br>important so then we went and checked<br>what does that do to Ozone<br>and the answer was uh not<br>much like 1% doesn't matter doesn't<br>matter but then we<br>realized these Pac-Man<br>chemicals get destroyed by sunlight and<br>we had done the experiment when the sun<br>was on so we did a gunkan experiment a<br>thought experiment we moved ourselves in<br>time to a time of the year when the sun<br>does not<br>shine which in the polar regions is a<br>lot of<br>it right there are times when it's<br>always daytime and there's times when<br>it's always night time and now our<br>Pac-Man chemicals can live they live and<br>produce a 25% decrease in Ozone and that<br>sort of thing is regarded as being<br>important more recently the British<br>Antarctic Survey has deployed a<br>groundbased instrument first to the<br>Norwegian based Troll and now to the<br>British Antarctic Survey base Hy to go<br>look for the Pac-Man chemicals and the<br>increases in them have been observed<br>following intense particle precipitation<br>events very recently working with our<br>Finnish collaborators and some American<br>satellite data we saw increases in the<br>other Pac-Man grouping the<br>Hawks where it turned out that onethird<br>of the variability in the polar<br>atmospheric Hawks would be could be<br>explained<br>by the particle precipitation stretch in<br>km and then this morning when I opened<br>my email I saw a beautiful picture from<br>my finnished collaborators showing that<br>we've finally got evidence in Satellite<br>measured ozone in the polar<br>regions of<br>13 to<br>90% decreases in high altitude ozone<br>after these particle precipitation<br>events but I'm not going to show them to<br>you cuz we're preparing it for a high<br>impact<br>journal and I don't want to get into<br>trouble but it's very exciting it's<br>really cool what else are we doing<br>well remember how I told you that the<br>flying bucket didn't really work we now<br>have years and years and years worth of<br>our groundbased radio Wes observations<br>here is observations from the 1st of<br>January 2005 to the 1st of January<br>2013 one minute resolution observations<br>of one of those large in this case<br>United States Navy transmitters and<br>we're trying to turn that data into a<br>continuous measurement of the electron<br>fluxes into the atmosphere it's not<br>it and he's doing really<br>well although his wife gave birth to a<br>baby two days ago congratulations Jason<br>thanks for<br>coming and he's doing really well okay<br>so how did this all<br>happen in August 1994 I'm a PhD student<br>with a<br>beard sitting on the fifth floor of the<br>physics department at the University of<br>tago and now I'm this guy who looks like<br>a less sweaty version of this<br>guy which is actually<br>Photoshop so how did it happen if you if<br>you go to the university of Atara<br>graduation<br>ceremonies there is a quote that is used<br>at every ceremony it's very fitting if<br>pronunciation what is the most important<br>thing in the world it is people it is<br>people it is<br>people now I do feel myself as a bit of<br>an archetypal physicist I.E not really a<br>people<br>person but it is very clear to me me<br>that my academic career and my and the<br>opportunity I have today for you to come<br>and celebrate my<br>promotion comes from people so first of<br>all I want to give thanks for my<br>collaborator Mark CL from the British<br>antartic survey who's sitting there he's<br>currently on sabatical with his wife and<br>son from the British antartic survey in<br>Cambridge we have worked together since<br>the end of 1997 we have more than 80<br>journals we just work so well together<br>it's really really wonderful so thank<br>you<br>Mark I would never have applied for this<br>promotion if I hadn't been told to by my<br>department and then supported by my<br>previous head of Department to say no no<br>no it's a good<br>idea it just didn't seem likely to<br>me and indeed the support that I<br>received from multiple heads of<br>Department in the physics department<br>over 10 years has taken me from a<br>lecturer grade three on a one-year<br>contract to a professor at the<br>tago my academic<br>colleagues do well we work together so<br>well but in particular sometimes they<br>traveling and I can only say thank you<br>to<br>them the technical staff are<br>vital even I as somebody who is<br>essentially a theorist has received much<br>support from the electronics and<br>mechanical technical workshops in the<br>physics department and I count myself<br>lucky that I am on the same my office is<br>on the same floor as the computer<br>technical support people cuz I visit<br>them almost<br>daily but without their support over all<br>this time I would never have got<br>anywhere<br>and of course not finally there is the<br>administrative staff who are constantly<br>looking after all of the things that I<br>need to do whether it is in my teaching<br>or my<br>research or my service<br>activities I have to thank my research<br>students some of whom are here today<br>many of whom cannot be probably they'll<br>be at the end of that video screen at<br>some point<br>hi thank you for working with me it's<br>been fun I have learned things from you<br>I hope you have learned things from me<br>but by working together we have exposed<br>things that we didn't understand which<br>us and I also have to give thanks for<br>the New Zealand masin fund because after<br>my postto in the UK at the British<br>Antarctic Survey I was offered a job<br>there and I wasn't sure what to do cuz I<br>really liked the British Antarctic<br>Survey but I didn't like living<br>there and the the problem went away<br>because I was was off at a<br>postto working for a retired Professor<br>from the physics department of the<br>University of tago and I would based in<br>the physics department of the University<br>of taga and when that ran out as Keith<br>said we invented a summer school paper<br>together and used the income to pay for<br>my<br>salary and then we did it again and then<br>we did it again and about that point<br>where I thought oh dear this might not<br>be working out so well I got a ma and<br>fast<br>start at which point the apartment felt<br>stuff now why did I get that M and fast<br>start because two people came to my<br>office and helped me fix up the junk I<br>had written and Kate barard and<br>Marge right are here today and they came<br>to my office way back in the day and<br>fixed up a whole lot of the stuff for me<br>and because I got that mden I got a<br>proper job and didn't go to the<br>University of Canterbury where I was<br>being interviewed as<br>well and I'm now on the mden fund<br>Council no council bad bad bad bad panel<br>panel panel council is very important<br>I'm on a<br>panel uh basically like most people turn<br>it down because it's a lot of work but<br>how can you turn it down when they made<br>your career and I'm sure that I got made<br>a professor and helped by the 2011<br>Marsen fun that I got I need to thank<br>all of the funders that have supported<br>my research my students research and my<br>collaborators research over time the New<br>Zealand Mars fund the University of<br>atago of<br>course the uh European Union 7eventh<br>seventh framework program who are<br>currently<br>sending something like 600 700,000 New<br>Zealand dollars to New Zealand so if<br>you're a European Union taxpayer thank<br>you very much and Antarctica New Zealand<br>who do all of the real work to enable me<br>to run an instrument down in the<br>Antarctic I do<br>paperwork they make it<br>go and finally I need to thank the<br>University tago because it's provided an<br>environment in which I've been able to<br>do the stuff that I actually wanted to<br>do this sort of job really suits me it<br>turns up whether a real job or an<br>outside job and the rest of the world<br>would I don't know but this this works<br>for me and it's worked for my students<br>too and so thank you to the university<br>and to its representative here today<br>Vice Chancellor Haren ha for making all<br>of that<br>possible and thank you to all of you for<br>coming<br>up thank you very much well you can see<br>why we hate to follow Craig in the<br>physics<br>department as a<br>lecturer and I have this unfortunate<br>task I am Pat Langhorn I'm the current<br>head of the Department of physics and<br>according to the instructions I am<br>supposed to comment on the content SL<br>significance of the lecture we have just<br>instead I see my role as more<br>maternal I think I have to Cal you all<br>down after a journey through space with<br>lots of very very dangerous objects and<br>so that's what I'm going to try and<br>do um you've already heard about Craig's<br>achievements but I just wanted to add<br>one that wasn't mentioned because it's<br>the kind of thing that head of<br>Department knows that other people don't<br>know and that is that Craig well maybe<br>not happily but does take on lots of<br>groy<br>jobs so when you say could you please go<br>and clean the toilets or whatever<br>actually not but he does all sorts of<br>jobs like uh run the first year Health<br>Science Program he he<br>um has written review reports etc etc<br>and these are the kind of jobs that<br>really matter to a head of department so<br>he's a very good departmental citizen<br>that we have a token of our<br>appreciation uh you will see that Craig<br>is not only a great researcher please<br>don't be lulled in into the sense of the<br>fact that you had fun therefore it must<br>be easy it's not he could have shown you<br>lots of very complicated and difficult<br>equations thank goodness he didn't<br>um but he's also as you will see one of<br>our favorite uh lecturers Unforgettable<br>you might think um we would like<br>therefore to present him with a token of<br>our appreciation<br>and just before I put the microphone<br>down to help you all C down I invite you<br>all to come<br>to uh drinks and<br>nibbles uh upstairs at the staff club<br>and if you don't know where the staff<br>Club is follow the line of<br>than</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
