Steve talked about the challenges of forecasting ecological developments, due to the many and varied factors that come into play. Humboldt's descriptive empirical work is contrasted with MacArthur's theoretical work, and the usefulness of modeling, in spite of its contingencies and complexities, is outlined.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>atago good evening um my name is harleen<br>Hayne and I'm the vice Chancellor here<br>at the University of Vago and it is my<br>great pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture it's<br>fantastic to see so many members of the<br>academic and the general staff from<br>around the university here as well as<br>our students and I'd like to um have uh<br>put forward a very warm welcome to<br>members of the community and also to<br>Professor Higgins family who I<br>understand is in the audience with us<br>this evening as<br>well um as the vice Chancellor um I'm<br>proud of a whole bunch of stuff about<br>the University of itago um and those of<br>you who hear me speak about the<br>university often uh will know that I'm<br>um very frequently expressing my pride<br>in various things but one of the things<br>that I'm particularly proud about um<br>that is relevant to this evening is that<br>the University of itago is the home to<br>the only Standalone botany Department um<br>in the country and that Standalone<br>department is actually going to<br>celebrate its 90th birthday this year so<br>I think that's something that we should<br>all collectively be very proud of as a<br>small island nation um it's obviously<br>very important for us um to understand<br>uh and to conserve our ecology and our<br>native plants and we are extremely<br>fortunate that we've been able to<br>attract yet another worldclass bnst uh<br>to the University of atago so it's my<br>great pleasure um to welcome Professor<br>Steven Higgins as the newest professor<br>of botney um Professor Higgins joined us<br>in August of last year and by now I hope<br>that he well and truly feels like a<br>member of the University of aago family<br>I would now like to invite Professor<br>Keith Hunter who is the pro Vice<br>Chancellor of Sciences to tell us just a<br>little bit more about Professor Higgins<br>atago thank you Vice Chancellor and um<br>may I say on behalf of the division of<br>Sciences this is one of the pleasurable<br>parts of my job even when it happens as<br>many times as it has<br>recently so Steven Higgins was born in<br>Johannesburg in South Africa and he got<br>a BS his BC degree in botany and zoology<br>at the University of the waterand in<br>Johannesburg and he followed that up by<br>a BC honors degree in botany so he he'd<br>got the botany bug by then he then<br>shifted to Cape Town where he did his<br>PhD at the University of Cape Town and<br>the title of his thesis was predicting<br>rates and patterns of alien plant spread<br>and this has had an influence on his um<br>later career he completed that in<br>1998 and that particular project project<br>was the result of the research strategy<br>of a new Institute that had been formed<br>at Cape Town and it really matched his<br>desire to move towards what you would<br>call quantitative and predictive<br>ecology so after the PHD he had 18<br>months as a postto back in WW sand in<br>Johannesburg which um gave him the<br>opportunity to work back in the Savanah<br>environments that he had missed while he<br>was in Cape<br>Town he left this for a permanent<br>position at the South African National<br>botanical Institute in Cape Town which<br>is an institution similar to land care<br>research in New Zealand as a research<br>scientist and he also spent a period of<br>time as a visiting postdoc at the cnrs<br>um in monal in<br>France then he was awarded a 3 to 5e<br>post-d doctoral fellowship at the center<br>for Environmental Research in Hala liik<br>The omal forong Institute<br>uh in October 2000 and there he worked<br>on Savannah ecology again and plant<br>migration harking back to his uh PhD<br>work after about three years in that<br>position he got a fellowship from the<br>Robert Bosch Foundation to set up his<br>own emerging scientist group uh which he<br>did at the Technical University of<br>Munich after three years in that<br>position he was awarded a professorship<br>in applied physical geography at the Yan<br>Wolfgang gerter University in<br>Frankfurt and that's the position he<br>occupied when he was recruited to the<br>University of atago so that brought to<br>an end 13 years uh in Germany and his<br>new adventure in New Zealand on a more<br>personal level uh Steven tells me that<br>he likes outdoor<br>things<br>well what aist wouldn't have you ever<br>heard of an indoor<br>ecologist so his in biking tramping<br>whitewater rafting kaying rock climbing<br>back country skiing and in generally<br>exploring places where there aren't many<br>people he says that in quotes he enjoys<br>running and jogging and I leave that for<br>your interpretation so all joking aside<br>uh stevenh congratulations on your<br>appointment as uh professor of Botany we<br>don't hire many professors of Botany and<br>so we hope you're going to be as good as<br>the distinguished ones we've had and I<br>lecture um so uh I guess that this<br>evening I'd like to sort of tell you<br>about um my way of of doing plant<br>ecology um the way um I've set about<br>trying to to to I guess um uh perform my<br>craft um uh I'm going to get sort of<br>launch straight into the presentation<br>without much of a a preamble um as Keith<br>actually maybe alluded to this um that<br>I've I've always been interested in in<br>in trying to uh predict things about<br>where we might expect plants to be<br>distributed in the world um to forecast<br>and to project and I've used these three<br>different words because in a way there's<br>some semantic debate in the literature<br>um to which extent we can really predict<br>things or not and whether we should say<br>that perhaps we can only project things<br>or we can only forecast things so um<br>predicting is has seen like a like a<br>word that should be used with Extreme<br>Caution in some uh disciplines um<br>especially in climate change science<br>people have become cautious of saying<br>that they can predict something um but<br>nonetheless I'm going to use this term<br>quite Loosely this evening so I hope<br>that people who are concerned about that<br>will forgive me um I guess it's it's<br>kind of well known and and I'm sure that<br>many of you have seen this quote before<br>that um prediction is difficult uh<br>especially about the future this um this<br>is a quote which Neils B used he didn't<br>he wasn't the first person to use it but<br>uh he was trying to point out the<br>differences between uh Swedish and<br>danish senses of humor apparently when<br>he when he used this term so those of<br>you who thought this was mildly amusing<br>might be leaning in one of those<br>directions<br>um anyhow uh my version of this is that<br>um prediction is is difficult especially<br>in in ecology and I'm going to talk go<br>through some of the reasons why I think<br>it is difficult in in ecology I think<br>that one reason just to give you a<br>flavor for it is that um ecology does<br>not really have the the equivalent of<br>sort of Newtonian mechanics which would<br>allow us to predict where we might<br>expect to find different organisms<br>distributed um uh and it doesn't really<br>have equivalent uh uh of of<br>thermodynamics perhaps to allow us to<br>say how energy matter will flow through<br>through an<br>ecosystem so um and I thought but before<br>I really get started I'd like to tell<br>you what is you know what is what is<br>ecology what is plant ecology because I<br>think people might have different<br>perceptions about uh what what ecology<br>is I've always battled um to explain to<br>people what I do when you meet a<br>complete stranger and they say what do<br>you do and you say well I'm an ecologist<br>and some people think you're might be an<br>environmental activist or um someone<br>they um should better avoid um um so<br>there are different perceptions of what<br>plant ecology is about um if you look<br>into a textbook uh you'll find a<br>definition of ecology is it uh<br>investigates the interactions between<br>organisms and their<br>environment uh if you're a plant<br>ecologist you might redraw that and say<br>well we investigate the interactions<br>between plants and their environment and<br>we relegate other organism or other<br>organisms do this other organisms block<br>or we subsume it into the environment U<br>components of this I think that for me<br>at least personally and and I think for<br>for a few of my colleagues um our<br>perceptions of of of what is plant<br>ecology and what is the environment have<br>have changed somewhat over the last uh<br>sort of 10 15 years because we've now<br>been acutely become acutely aware of of<br>climate change and the role that plants<br>play in in the broader Earth system um<br>so our perception of the environment is<br>maybe much broader than maybe just one<br>vegetation patch which we might be<br>studying intensively we're now much more<br>interested in broader linkages in the<br>earth system and the and the the<br>connections in the earth system and and<br>how um Global circulation systems<br>interact with with plants to uh<br>influence Earth System Dynamics so that<br>really says that we're interested in<br>quite large scale processes at the<br>moment but on the other hand I think it<br>also means that we interested in a whole<br>bunch of different time domains uh we're<br>interested in processes that U play out<br>on seconds uh for instance we might<br>measure photosynthetic rates in micro<br>moles per met squ per second um but we<br>might also be uh very interested in<br>processes geological processes that<br>occurred millions of years ago and<br>evolutionary processes that occur<br>occurred millions of years ago and those<br>processes still resonate today and<br>influence the kinds of dynamics that we<br>see when we study an ecosystem today and<br>um that's a that's I guess an an<br>important perspective to have<br>so how do you go about doing plant<br>ecology and I thought well there there<br>lots of different ways to do this and I<br>thought that to to it would be useful to<br>contrast two two ecologists who who are<br>now dead so they won't be offended if I<br>misrepresent them um on the one hand um<br>Alexander Fon hbel who we could say is a<br>you know really influential uh figure in<br>ecology U maybe perhaps one of the first<br>ecologists um and is really perhaps a<br>father or parent of of empirical ecology<br>and on the other hand there's Robert<br>MacArthur who as you can see there<br>unfortunately didn't live to such a ripe<br>old age like f hbal did um and he could<br>be seen as as really a personification<br>of of theoretical ecology I wouldn't say<br>he was the first theoretical ecologist<br>but he was he was incredibly influential<br>in um spawning uh uh the popular or sort<br>of facilitating the popularity of of<br>theoretical methods especially in in in<br>the US in in ecology<br>um so fhal went out and he he M the<br>world if you will uh you went out and<br>described where plants grew and um<br>related that to to environmental factors<br>and um it describes some interesting<br>patterns for instance in this diagram we<br>can see um how the the the position of<br>the tree line uh varies with with<br>elevation and um the position of that<br>tree line and the elevation of that tree<br>line is for instance influenced by by<br>latitude here contrast between the<br>position of the elevation of the tree<br>line in in in the AL helps in Europe and<br>in uh the in in lap land um so hot in a<br>way really um demonstrated it to us the<br>the power of of description I think um<br>lots of sort of modern ecologists<br>somehow uh often turn the nose up a<br>little bit about purely descriptive work<br>but I think it's a very important stop<br>step in the knowledge generation process<br>uh without going out and recognizing<br>patterns and describing patterns we<br>don't know what we're trying to explain<br>so um I think it's is a very very<br>important uh uh step despite its perhaps<br>unpopularity at the moment<br>um you so if if if if if humal was sort<br>of showed us the power of of data and of<br>empiricism um MacArthur really<br>demonstrated us to us the power of of of<br>abstraction of um of um simplifying what<br>what you see in nature and the thing<br>about MacArthur which I think made him<br>useful as an ecologist was that he was a<br>pretty good natural historian so he was<br>a keen Observer of nature um but at the<br>same time was a gifted mathematician and<br>he could take these observations and<br>Abstract them into a series of simple<br>equations uh which would then um allow<br>him uh to to build models and um so I<br>hope that's the first time I've used<br>that word model in this talk um so<br>because um so models is we're going to<br>hear a lot about them in the rest of<br>this talk and I I've spent lots of time<br>thinking about how how to communicate to<br>people who don't use models what models<br>are and and what they are about and<br>you'll find lots of quotes out there<br>about what models are and what they are<br>not um I found this quote recently which<br>uh is apparently attributed to Picasso<br>although some people debate whether he<br>ever said that he said it in Spanish<br>anyway so who knows um but the point I<br>think it's a very useful idea that that<br>art is is a lie that reveals the truth<br>and um we can think of models uh in a<br>similar way models are also lies they<br>they simplifications and abstractions of<br>reality um but by analyzing a model and<br>studying a model we can hopefully reveal<br>a truth about the system which we are<br>are trying to study so I'm going to show<br>you one little model made by MacArthur<br>he made it with a guy called Wilson it's<br>a model that he became quite famous for<br>um he was interested in the number of<br>species that might exist on a Island and<br>he postulated that the number of species<br>that you might expect on an island must<br>have something to do with the rates at<br>which species colonize those islands and<br>the rates at which they go extinct on<br>those islands and you know if you if if<br>your island has very few species on it<br>the idea is that every seed that maybe<br>arrives on that island might be a new<br>species so you would initially have<br>quite a high colonization rate of new<br>species onto that island and similarly<br>if you have no species on the island<br>then there're no species to go extinct<br>so your Extinction rate will also be<br>low um but as you get more and more<br>species on that island and seeds keep<br>arriving the next seed to arrive it's<br>unlikely that that next seed is going to<br>be for a new going to be belong to a new<br>species so this colonization rate starts<br>decreasing and the point where these<br>colonization and Extinction rates match<br>each other um is is actually the<br>prediction of the number of species that<br>you would expect on on that island and<br>um so that might seem rather Tri but it<br>is kind of useful if one starts thinking<br>well what happens if we went to an<br>island uh we had a different Extinction<br>rate if we had a bigger island where we<br>had bigger populations of species and<br>they were more unlikely to go extinct<br>um uh we would perhaps have lower<br>Extinction rates represented by this<br>lower curve here and then we would on<br>species so you know I think I'd like to<br>you know explore in this talk a little<br>bit this one proposition is that ecology<br>might be on the brink of a golden age<br>because you know humal would perhaps<br>Marvel at the sort of unprecedented<br>richness of data that we have available<br>to us we have Earth observation<br>satellites just producing gigabytes of<br>data per second you know and uh and<br>MacArthur would you know sit back and<br>Marvel at the sort of the Rich and<br>maturing theory that e colist have at<br>their hands now and I think that the<br>real bonus is that we now also have the<br>the computational power to now start<br>using computers to confront uh this<br>Theory uh with with data in ways that<br>weren't uh possible before of course<br>there's a there's a contrary perspective<br>to this um and that that ecology is<br>clueless uh<br>rudderless um and um the reasons for<br>this are that um you know ecological<br>systems are wonderfully complex uh and<br>they're driven by contingencies and we<br>love this complexity that's why we sit<br>and watch David atenor videos because we<br>just marvel at that isn't nature amazing<br>and this can make it actually difficult<br>uh to to to make<br>predictions uh and the implication of<br>this is yeah as I said it makes it<br>difficult to to to make predictions and<br>would we only have really modest ability<br>to forecast the<br>future so in the rest of this talk I I<br>kind of want to contrast these uh these<br>two ideas um that you know we on the<br>brink of this golden age or are we kind<br>of rudderless as as as<br>ecologists um<br>and I I I hope that these um examples<br>that I'm going to use are going to serve<br>um serve as a well an illustration of<br>the fact that that perhaps we aren't<br>rless and that perhaps we can um rise to<br>some of the the challenges that have<br>been posed to us at the<br>moment okay so the first reason why<br>ecology might be rless is rless is that<br>um is that the devil might be in the<br>detail so there's some little intricate<br>idiosyncrasy um that regulates how the<br>whole system works and the key to<br>ecology is to find that detail right and<br>so the you know there's going to be lots<br>of Savannah examples I'm going to<br>apologize for that once and um then get<br>on with them so savanas you know they're<br>these ecosystems that occur quite widely<br>distributed in the world they're shown<br>in the red colors here on on on this<br>diagram so you can see they're quite<br>widespread ecosystems and they defined<br>as ecosystems where you have a<br>continuous grass layer and a<br>discontinuous tree layer um<br>and this sort of<br>formation well what is what is kind of<br>interesting about savanas is that<br>grasses and trees manage to coexist over<br>this very broad range of conditions And<br>yet when we look at a grass and we look<br>at a tree they have fundamentally<br>different carbon economies they have<br>different ways about going about their<br>business a tree will invest all these<br>carbon resources into producing this<br>massive scaffolding for displaying its<br>leaves whereas a grass will just get on<br>with the business of attaching some leav<br>to its roots and photosynthesizing<br>without investing in all this this big<br>infrastructure so these are completely<br>different ways of doing your business<br>but they're doing this business in<br>exactly the same place so you would<br>think that if if trees were just<br>slightly better competitors than than<br>grasses then given enough time they<br>should be able to outcompete grasses and<br>form a forest or if grasses were<br>slightly better than than trees we'd<br>expect grasses to ex exclude trees and<br>and and form a step or or a grassland<br>system but neither of these two<br>possibilities really emerges over such a<br>broad range of environmental conditions<br>and this kind of bothered ecologists for<br>some time um and one of the explanations<br>one of the first actually plausible<br>explanations was proposed was proposed<br>by someone called Florian yel who um who<br>was one of was actually my one of my<br>predecessors in in in in in in um in<br>liic in Germany in theel forong Centrum<br>so I ended up um sitting at his desk<br>when he left um and so he's a nice guy<br>and nice piece of work um but I think<br>you know he argued essentially that<br>savanas owe their existence to<br>idiosyncratic detail of how tree<br>seedlings establish and I just found<br>that hard to believe that the entire<br>presence of this ecosystem over all<br>these regions is somehow due to some<br>little detail about how the seedlings<br>germinate um so we you spent some time<br>trying to think about other simpler<br>explanations for for for for grass tree<br>Coes in in savanas and we we show that<br>um that you can actually actually<br>explain the coexistence of of um grasses<br>and trees in savanas but just actually<br>simply exploring the consequences of the<br>fact that um that roots are not shoots<br>um so that roots and shoots perform<br>different functions uh in plants and if<br>we take this into account and we put<br>that into a model then we just open up a<br>whole range of possibilities and ways in<br>which um trees and grasses can coexist<br>and of a very broad range of<br>environmental conditions and then all of<br>a sudden it doesn't become surprising at<br>all that um grasses and trees can<br>coexist over such a broad range of<br>conditions so I think this example to me<br>shows that that if we you know force<br>ourselves or or lose for a moment our<br>fascination with the intricacy of a<br>system and um start focusing on some of<br>the consequences of the obvious things<br>like roots or not shoots um that we can<br>find explanations which are quite<br>parsimonious<br>um uh and and actually very useful for<br>making predictions and the other point<br>about this model was that it it was<br>actually pretty good at um describing<br>the observed um uh pattern of Woody tree<br>biomass in the African continent so<br>that's just the one to one line of the<br>model predictions trained on on the data<br>so I guess to to return to this<br>rhetorical question you know is the<br>devil in the detail I I guess you know<br>my answer is you know only if you some<br>sort of romantic or you'd like to find<br>the answer there but it doesn't<br>necessarily have to be uh the<br>case so the the the next sort of reason<br>why we might uh find that ecology is<br>rudderless is that um contextual<br>contingencies might o overwhelm us um so<br>it's not so much some undiscovered<br>process that we're trying to find it's<br>that we we somehow believe that<br>um um<br>that the importance of a known process<br>is highly dependent on its context and<br>um so the example that I'm going to give<br>you now is from from my PhD and this is<br>also the reason why um after my PhD I<br>didn't want to work on plant invasions<br>for a very very long time um so this is<br>uh the the the study system that we were<br>working on this was is similar to your<br>wildling Pine or our wildling Pine<br>situation in New Zealand um we have uh<br>this is a Pine species invading a Fain<br>boss landscape in in in the cape in<br>South Africa and we were interested in<br>the question of what are the factors<br>that influence which kinds of pine<br>species are going to invade which kinds<br>of environments in the Southern<br>Hemisphere and uh so this is a study I<br>did with my PhD supervisor Dave<br>Richardson who um you can see I am did<br>another project with him recently now so<br>it's nice to be working back with him<br>again after all these years so we set up<br>a little model system where we um<br>explored what is the role of ecosystem<br>type plant traits and disturbance on an<br>influencing Invasion success don't worry<br>too much about the details here but when<br>we do this little experiment and we try<br>and calculate what are the effects of<br>these different factors we can see that<br>they all these factors the ecosystem<br>type the plant traits the disturbance<br>type they all produce measurable effects<br>on The Invasion rate here measured um in<br>plants per year but then if we start<br>looking at the interactions between<br>these factors so if we start uh exam<br>examining for instance the factor shade<br>tolerance might not be on average such a<br>useful trait for facilitating invasions<br>in these systems but it might be a<br>useful trait to have if you're trying to<br>if that plant species is trying to<br>invade a forest<br>um so the interesting thing about this<br>is that these first order interactions<br>are just as large in magnitude as the<br>main effects at the top um and secondly<br>if we do this you know if we go on<br>further and start looking at the second<br>order interaction so we think of shade<br>tolerance as a useful trait when you're<br>invading a forest but maybe not a forest<br>that has been disturbed by a fire uh<br>then we uh see that those kind of second<br>order interactions are also pretty large<br>in magnitude so this means that the<br>answer to the question is the trade<br>shade tolerance any use for predicting<br>invasions is highly contingent on the<br>context that we're looking at and I<br>thought this this really really a bad<br>news problem I think um I'll leave this<br>to people to work on um so um that was<br>the end of my dabbling in in Invasions<br>for quite a while and I've this year<br>actually just returned to it um and uh I<br>thought well what happens if we sort of<br>try to step back from looking at all<br>this detail of what's going on and<br>trying to find a more aggregated measure<br>of the factors that influence Invasion<br>success and uh and specifically I was<br>starting of thinking of some sort of<br>aggregated physiological measure of<br>invasion of success so we used the model<br>which is perhaps not so different from<br>that Savannah model in that we we we we<br>recognize that plants have shoots and<br>Roots lots of models of of plants just<br>have one box of biomass and they don't<br>have shoots and roots in them um and we<br>also considered that Within These uh<br>roots and choot compartments we have<br>different pools we have biomass pools we<br>have a carbon pool and a nitrogen pool<br>and it's the fluxes between these<br>different pools and how these fluxes are<br>perhaps influenced by different<br>environmental forces factors which is<br>really um critical to influencing the<br>places or uh where plants can grow and<br>their relative rates of biomass growth<br>so the question is how do we use this<br>model and Link it now to data to um to<br>make predictions and what we've been<br>doing is using data on the distribution<br>of species so in this case aasa delbas<br>and Australian species and we see here<br>in red this are the places where where<br>it occurs and in green are the places<br>where where where it doesn't occur in in<br>Australia and if we essentially use this<br>distribution pattern and um try and use<br>it to infer how these environmental<br>dependencies here influence the fluxes<br>in the model we can Define the<br>environmental tolerances of the study<br>species that we might be looking at so<br>essentially this means that we<br>interpreting this distribution pattern<br>that we seeing here through this model<br>and we're using that interpretation<br>allows us to infer the environmental<br>tolerances of the species and when we do<br>that we can then make a projection of<br>where we would expect um the species AA<br>debata in this case to be uh distributed<br>throughout the<br>world um but we didn't just do this for<br>one or two species we went and did this<br>for<br>750 Australia aaia and eucalypt species<br>where we know that these species have<br>been introduced into different parts of<br>the world over the last 100 years and we<br>know for each of these cases is whether<br>that introduction has been successful<br>whether the species is being able to<br>establish itself or whether it's been<br>able to establish itself and spread from<br>its um sites of initial planting in<br>which case we'd call it<br>invasive<br>um so the interesting thing is when you<br>when you plot all these data together<br>and you look at um the potential range<br>so this red area on this graph is<br>showing me the potential range of AAL<br>de if we look at the potential ranges of<br>species that are uh were invasive we see<br>that they have much larger potential<br>ranges than species that um failed uh to<br>naturalize and wider than species that<br>um uh were naturalized but did not<br>become um invasive so it seems like that<br>there's a a simple aggregated<br>measure um of of environmental tolerance<br>revealed by the potential distribution<br>of species and then we can use this<br>measure to Simply rank um the invasive<br>risk that different species um might<br>pose so I think what's nice about this<br>is is it it gives you an answer that you<br>can use and it also allows you to<br>sidestep this problem of having to<br>identify which physiological trait is it<br>that actually allows species to be<br>invasive because again the answer to<br>that question is context specific so<br>this um both deals with it well<br>acknowledges that problem but at the<br>same time provides a solution which is<br>pragmatic and would allow people to<br>actually rank species relative to other<br>in terms of their invasive risk so I<br>think you know do these contingencies<br>prevent us from seeing the answer I<br>think if you believe that might be the<br>case it might be that you're looking too<br>close and you're focusing in on some<br>perhaps irrelevant detail and that if<br>you step back you can perhaps see a<br>picture which is a usable picture it<br>might not be that photo realism you were<br>hoping for when you got started with the<br>project but it is still um a very very<br>usable picture which allows us to make<br>um progress so I guess now I want to<br>return to this question of uh you know<br>this diagram here where we s we're very<br>interested now in ecologists in in<br>articulating the role of plants in the<br>earth system and um and really<br>addressing the challenges that Earth<br>system science poses for terrestrial<br>plant<br>ecology<br>um yeah so this is the question on can<br>our models that we're using in this<br>regard um can they reveal the truth or<br>are they also just um yeah kind of<br>useless so um so Sir John Lon he was<br>he's a influential ecologist from from<br>the UK and a few years ago now he wrote<br>a review paper uh discussing whether<br>ecology had any laws uh<br>whatsoever and um you mostly ended up<br>saying well yeah not really um we we're<br>battling here and there but when it<br>comes to sort of broadscale patterns<br>we've got the Whittier plot um and this<br>is you know the Whittier plot uh so it's<br>one of uh the great generalizations this<br>is apparently the best we can do as<br>ecologists um if you tell me for<br>instance the mean annual<br>precipitation uh I think it's in danan I<br>looked it up it's about 75 cm and the<br>mean annual temperature is around 10° so<br>this is what the wha plot will tell you<br>where you are congratulations you're<br>living in a grassland shrub scrub or<br>Woodland<br>um so I thought well that maybe that's a<br>bit unfair because we don't really know<br>what those things are um let's try the<br>catlins so we then we'd be somewhere<br>between 150 and 200 cm and we also<br>around about 10° cels and would' be in<br>temperate deciduous forest so the<br>interesting thing about New Zealand is<br>it's not very deciduous so again the wha<br>plot um seems to fail there so this is<br>what's called The Back Garden test if<br>anyone ever presents to you a global uh<br>model you just try and see if it works<br>in your back garden and that neck of<br>your Woods that you know and often it<br>doesn't it it might be pretty reasonable<br>at a global scale but often fails<br>miserably in in in a whole bunch of<br>circumstances um nonetheless despite the<br>fact that we you know good reason to<br>question the Whitaker plot it does form<br>the foundation of a group of models<br>which are called uh Dynamic Global<br>vegetation models and so this picture<br>here is a<br>representation of the max plank<br>institute's Global V vation model which<br>is called jsb we love these little<br>acronyms um so anyway um but this model<br>is primarily based on this idea of of<br>the Whitaker plot and and the<br>environmental tolerances that are in the<br>Whitaker plot and I'm going to run<br>through several reasons why this isn't<br>the wha plots although useful is is<br>inadequate the first is that you know<br>rainfall and temperature alone do not<br>Define vegetation States uh if we were<br>interested in for instance the<br>probability of the vegetation being my<br>favorite ecosystem type Savannah um and<br>how that might change is a function of<br>rainfall and we did that at 170 parts<br>per million atmospheric CO2<br>concentration which is what we have in<br>the end of the last ice age um we would<br>get this answer that we would expected<br>of quite a wide range of of rainfall<br>conditions but if we ramp it up to 400<br>we move just past 400 so congratulations<br>for that as well um and we would see<br>there's a much more restricted range of<br>rainfall conditions where we would<br>expect to see Savannah and where we ramp<br>it up to 700 parts per million where<br>we're going in the future that uh range<br>becomes even more restricted so rainfall<br>and temperature alone are not going to<br>define the vegetation state for us the<br>other result which um is a study by uh<br>by Glenn monrie who's in the audience um<br>so um is that um is that ecological<br>history uh makes a difference as well so<br>if we if we assumed that a long time ago<br>that um Africa was covered in grassland<br>and we initiated the African continent<br>as a as a grassland ecosystem and then<br>allowed vegetation to develop on it as<br>influenced by by climate we would get um<br>this uh prediction that um these are the<br>places where we would expect to see<br>forest in in<br>Africa but if we assumed that a long<br>time ago Africa was covered by Forest<br>and we initiated um model world with<br>forest and allowed it to develop over<br>time we would get this answer so we<br>would get that Forest would be much more<br>widespread and this is because of a kind<br>of priority effect once a forest<br>ecosystem becomes established it can<br>shade out the grasses and prevent the<br>grasses from invading the system<br>similarly once a grassy Savannah is<br>established it encourages fire which can<br>prevent uh tree seedlings uh from from<br>establish or Forest seedlings from<br>establishing so these initial conditions<br>are really important um and dgvm<br>modelers people who do this kind of<br>modeling have curiously gone to um great<br>pains to actually remove any effects of<br>initial conditions on on on their<br>simulations because they thought that<br>that might bias their results um the<br>other point even worse than than uh<br>ecological history matter mattering you<br>know or even worse even more difficult<br>to deal with is that evolutionary<br>history um matters so if we're looking<br>at savanas um now we'd expect things to<br>be quite similar because we're calling<br>them savanas and they must have some<br>similarities about them but if we go in<br>and we look a little bit closer uh at<br>the properties of these Savannah<br>ecosystems we do discover some<br>differences and so this is one<br>difference that we've been<br>exploring and uh that is that the<br>architecture of Savannah trees differs<br>quite dramatically so if you're in<br>Australia you have these tall spindly<br>little trees um and in you know in the<br>African savanas they sort of shorten fat<br>the trees U by by by comparison so and<br>when we try to understand why is this<br>why do we have this difference we is it<br>something to do with the different soils<br>in the different regions is it related<br>to differences in the climate we find<br>that in fact the the best explanation<br>for these differences uh well that those<br>those factors do not explain actually<br>much of the variance in the<br>architectural differences that we we are<br>seeing and that most most of those<br>differences are actually attributed to<br>the fact that um in Australian savanas<br>eucalyp Rule and in African savanas<br>things formerly known as aaas ruled um<br>so essentially this means that the<br>evolutionary and philogenetic history of<br>um savanas is really influencing these<br>these um patterns that we we're seeing<br>and knowing more about the biophysics of<br>the process is not going to help us we<br>need to know more about the evolutionary<br>history of these places<br>so what are the consequences of ignoring<br>this evolutionary history because<br>currently we do do that when we do these<br>Earth System model runs so if we had<br>data again on savanas and we were<br>interested in what are the factors that<br>control the biomass that we see in these<br>different savanas on these three<br>continents um we we have I guess two<br>choices we could either say well let's<br>pull all the data together and do one<br>big analysis because more data must be<br>better or we could say we do three<br>different analysis<br>one for um South America one for Africa<br>and one from Australia and then see what<br>answer we get and this is what Caroline<br>Leeman um did in in in a study and in<br>the study um so she essentially well we<br>essentially I was part of the study so<br>we essentially s um um investigated um<br>the consequences of using this one siiz<br>fits all model so the global model and<br>then we asked what would happen to<br>biomass in Africa uh if we had a 4<br>degree change in temperature and we see<br>we get a slight shift uh a reduction in<br>5 tons per Hector of of biomass on the<br>African continents but if we um use the<br>model which is calibrated in Africa and<br>do the same exercise we see that we get<br>a shift in the other direction that we<br>get an increase in 8 tons per Hector and<br>these differences again are not<br>attributable to differences in the<br>environmental conditions on the<br>different continents but primarily um<br>attributable to the genetic history of<br>these um different regions so we'd be<br>making really the wrong predictions if<br>we um ignored these factors and tried to<br>find a general model which can explain<br>everything so the state of play with<br>regards to using plant ecology or or how<br>to the extent to which plant ecology can<br>address the challenges posed by Earth<br>system science is summarized in this<br>slide I guess first of all I mean<br>climate does matter the whiter plot<br>remains important although I've said<br>it's not the complete answer we've also<br>learned that CO2 is really important so<br>the atmospheric CO2 concentration<br>matters the ecological history matters<br>um and I put ticks next to each of those<br>things because we have the wha plots we<br>have models that can deal with CO2<br>effects quite well people haven't been<br>looking at ecological history but all<br>the models are set up to do it and so<br>there's not no real problem moving<br>forward with that but how we deal with<br>these evolutionary history aspects is um<br>is something that I'm yeah I'm quite uh<br>well I'm quite intrigued to see how we<br>we going to deal with it because I think<br>it is a really difficult problem um<br>we've at least been trying to develop<br>some tools now which allow us to explore<br>the role of these evolutionary Dynamics<br>in these kind of dynamic Global<br>vegetation models and essentially we're<br>simulating how traits evolve um over<br>Generations in such models and we model<br>individual plants and each one of these<br>plants has a set of attributes or traits<br>associated with it and these traits are<br>heritable and uh develop over over the<br>course of a<br>simulation um so this is quite a quite a<br>complex diagram and um what it<br>shows is that um we can simulate the<br>evolution of different plant strategies<br>in response to different selective<br>regimes and the different colors<br>represent the different selective<br>regimes and the positions of the points<br>in this graph represent how similar the<br>individual plants are from one another<br>in terms of their um ecolog iCal<br>strategies that that they adopt that<br>that evolve over the course of the<br>simulation so we see this might appear<br>at first glance like a nice solution so<br>in each different selective regime we<br>get a cluster of points suggesting you<br>get the same solution evolving when you<br>have the same selective uh forcing in<br>the model but this is of course not<br>really how nature works because this is<br>I've assumed when we've done this is<br>that we have um we have no reproductive<br>isolation that is every individual can<br>breed with every other individual in the<br>model and of course that's not how<br>ecology Works uh we have these things<br>called species and mostly we have these<br>things called species which prevent um<br>gene flow between um individuals that<br>are from different species so if we<br>introduce this uh reproductive isolation<br>into the model we see the situation<br>becomes a lot more complicated we get<br>multiple Solutions sort of these two<br>yellow Solutions multiple strategies<br>emerging in response to the same active<br>forces and the strategies that evolve<br>are different from those that evolve<br>when we um we uh uh ignore reproductive<br>isolation so this leaves us kind of in a<br>in a difficult position because it's<br>showing that these evolutionary Dynamics<br>are really<br>important<br>um but at the same time it's indicating<br>that uh well how do we we can't predict<br>a priori what these um strategies are<br>going to be where these yellow dots are<br>going to going to be if I run the<br>simulation again I might get a different<br>answer because there's an elements of<br>stochasticity and chance in this um so I<br>guess this puts us in a position where<br>we have to really start thinking about<br>how are we going to parameterize models<br>to deal with these evolutionary<br>idiosyncrasies and the idea that we can<br>use first principles to do that uh I<br>think is naive and I think that we need<br>to start uh locally calibrating models<br>to<br>parameterize um the effects of<br>biodiversity rather like a climate<br>modeler the the the better a climate<br>modeler can um describe the climate that<br>we have today the or the weather<br>conditions today and he can initiate his<br>model with very precise estimates of the<br>current temperature and atmospheric<br>pressure and whatnot then the further<br>into the future he can make a reliable<br>forecast and it's the same story with<br>with this I think that if we can better<br>parameterize the biodiversity that we<br>have in different places in the world<br>the more reliably we can then uh make<br>projections in Into the<br>Future so I'm going to start summing up<br>a bit I think um about prediction in<br>ecology I think for me I I I I remain of<br>the opinion that it is that prediction<br>is is difficult in in especially in<br>ecology um but I hope that I've been<br>able to communicate to you that our<br>fascination with natural history can<br>somehow seduce us into focusing on on<br>intricate aspects the neat bits of<br>ecology rather than the relevant bits of<br>ecology that are important for the<br>applied question we might have at hand<br>and the other point is that some of<br>ecology's most cherished laws have been<br>shown to be inadequate by climate change<br>they you know the the Whittier plot<br>Alone um is not going to get us very far<br>and that predictive ecology is really<br>only beginning to embrace the importance<br>of evolutionary history for making<br>projections of how the Earth system is<br>going to develop in in the<br>future so this leaves us kind of in a<br>situation where you know you say well<br>ecology it looks like it's Lawless you<br>know um but I think it might be Lawless<br>but you know it does have its principles<br>and um and some of these principles have<br>have their consequences and you know I'm<br>going to run through some of these<br>principles some of them are quite<br>trivial time runs forward if you know if<br>time ran backwards things would be quite<br>crazy um the world is finite this is<br>something that politicians and<br>economists or uh business people<br>frequently forget uh but that does have<br>its consequence this this uh this uh<br>principle um trade-offs exist so there's<br>no such thing as a free lunch uh this<br>means that if you're for example very<br>good Suma wrestler you're unlikely to be<br>very good at running the 100 meters um<br>and individuals do things they grow<br>reproduce they die and they move and<br>they vary from one another which means<br>that they do things these things at at<br>at different rates and some of the<br>consequences of this of these factors<br>are things like density dependence once<br>we run out of resources things start<br>dying<br>um things by using resources and<br>consuming resources and growing they<br>engineer their environment they<br>influence their environment so we have<br>this feedback between plants and their<br>environment<br>um we also all these factors together<br>really set the ground for for for<br>evolutionary Dynamics to occur the fact<br>that IND individuals vary from each<br>other and they do these uh go about<br>their growth and reproduction at<br>different rates means that um that<br>Evolution takes<br>place so um I'd like to before I you<br>know finish up completely um thank a<br>whole bunch of organizations for for<br>funding support uh this is sort of a<br>historical Legacy of places that I've<br>maybe worked beforehand but I also like<br>to thank the University of otago<br>although I'm relatively new here that<br>did give me really generous startup<br>money which has um allowed me to kind of<br>hit the ground running now and I'm I'm<br>appreciative of that and I'd also like<br>to acknowledge the people um who I've<br>collaborated with in the past um and<br>continue to collaborate with um this i'<br>I've just put up the people whose work<br>I've I've actually talked about um to<br>tonight so this is rather sort of semi-<br>random selection of of of people um but<br>yeah I'm very grateful to to them for<br>for all their help um W with with my<br>work and then finally you know I'd like<br>to thank the the botany<br>Department um and the University of<br>atago for providing you know a very<br>welcoming environment to me and I'm<br>really looking forward to um yeah being<br>a plant person in UMO for maybe more<br>than uh the period I tend to stay in<br>jobs which has been three or four years<br>it's I'm sure I'm going to up that uh<br>now so thank you very much for your<br>thank you Steve um my name is Cass enson<br>I'm the head of the Department of Botany<br>and it's it's great to be able to thank<br>Steve for a very stimulating lecture and<br>also you know um welcome you um in this<br>forum to the Department of Botany in the<br>University of<br>Vago listening to Steve it comes to mind<br>over um some of you might remember The<br>Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and<br>Douglas ads maybe many of you are too<br>young for this but um the uh according<br>to the computer deep thought the answer<br>was 42 I don't know whether that helps<br>Steve um deep thought after spending<br>many many many many many eons thinking<br>about couldn't come up with the question<br>even though it was the answer I think<br>some of the things that we can think<br>about from um Steve talking about is<br>about the power prediction but also<br>having that caution and what a great<br>overview of thinking about the very<br>small two from the organism through to<br>the ecosystem but also the importance of<br>understanding plant physiology and now<br>we might actually make<br>generalizations it also comes to another<br>um thought or analogy that comes to<br>sometimes management we talk about um<br>helicopter thinking and helicopter<br>thinking of course is the big picture<br>and it's maybe this is something that<br>Picasso was thinking about except that<br>was probably before helicopters came<br>online but the helicopter thinking is uh<br>have the big picture but you know you<br>can spend too much time the helicopter<br>so it pays to come down to land<br>sometimes and you want to land and U be<br>able to land without crashing so I think<br>Steve you've you've come um to us and<br>portray to us where plant ecology is in<br>the present day where we need to keep<br>our uh feet very strongly grounded it's<br>not just the choots it's the roots but<br>also if I come back to the vice<br>Chancellor mentioned that the botney<br>department the best in the<br>country um yes um we are the best in the<br>country we turned 90 this year we were<br>um uh created in<br>1924 uh we're having celebration from<br>the 10th to the 13th of September this<br>year and our by line for this is botney<br>our heritage our future what better way<br>to demonstrate the 21st century of where<br>botany is Heading by your demonstration<br>tonight um Steve it's our heritage our<br>future and I predict you've got a great<br>future with us in the botney department<br>and I'm absolutely thrilled on behalf of<br>the Department of botney to welcome you<br>and thank you and thank you all for<br>coming here tonight and it takes me<br>great pleasure to invite you come to the<br>staff Club upstairs we have wonderful<br>nibbles and great wine and beer thanks<br>you thank you Vice Chancellor yeah so<br>please um join with me to thank Steve<br>once again for a great lecture and a<br>welcome to the University of Vago thank</p></main><footer
