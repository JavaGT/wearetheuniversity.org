Chancellor<br>here at the University of itago um and<br>it is fantastic to see so many people<br>who have come in from the beautiful<br>sunshine outside um to share in the<br>celebration of Jamon halbert's inaugural<br>professorial lecture um I would like to<br>warmly welcome both academic and general<br>staff um who have come here oh my gosh<br>who have come here um this afternoon um<br>as well as members of the general public<br>and I would also like to extend a very<br>warm welcome to members of Jam's family<br>um his wife Cindy um who has for the<br>last 20 some years been his harshest<br>critic and his fiercest Ally um in both<br>his science and his life and his two<br>brilliant children Abby and Paxton it's<br>great to have you both here with us this<br>evening<br>um now they say that all great things<br>come in threes and this evening um we<br>get to celebrate the third inaugural<br>professorial lecture from the psychology<br>department uh for this year and like the<br>two inaugural professorial lectures that<br>came before James um both Professor<br>Elaine Ree and Professor Liz fron um<br>Jamon again has very very very um warmly<br>earned uh the honor of becoming a<br>professor now I think I I was going to<br>say possibly come the farthest for this<br>lecture but I see that Jonathan is here<br>and maybe he has come even farther but I<br>just came from Toronto this morning um<br>in order to be here so I took a 30-hour<br>plane trip in order to be here on time<br>for Jam's professorial and as I was<br>flying on the plane I thought what can I<br>say um about someone who I have known<br>for over two decades and what would I be<br>able to deliver in my jet lag<br>state but while I was thinking on the<br>plane one of the things I was reminded<br>of is that I have the great pleasure of<br>reading all of the professorial<br>promotion materials for all of the<br>professors in the university and I seem<br>to recall um that when Jam's promotion<br>package came forward that his letters<br>were particularly<br>laudatory so I thought that rather than<br>relying on my own words this evening I<br>would go back and look at some of those<br>letters of recommendation um and see<br>whether or not I had in fact created a<br>false memory um or whether those letters<br>were in fact as strong as I recalled so<br>I had a great time this afternoon Jamon<br>actually reviewing your promotion<br>materials and um my memory was not false<br>um in fact all of Jam's letters from<br>internationally recognized experts in<br>his field um were extraordinarily<br>complimentary of Jam's work and I<br>thought just by way of example I would<br>share with you um one little snippet um<br>from one of those letters um but it<br>certainly exemplified I the sentiment<br>from all of them this is what your<br>referee had to say Jamon I view Jam<br>Halbert stat as the complete academic<br>package A Gifted and productive<br>researcher a highly original thinker and<br>Innovative methodologist an outstanding<br>graduate mentor and supervisor and a<br>superb Citizen and contributor to the<br>department University and the discipline<br>so I think that statement aptly<br>summarizes why we are here tonight<br>celebrating Jam's promotion to Professor<br>because he truly is the whole academic<br>package I would now like to hang hand<br>over to the Prov Vice Chancellor of<br>Sciences Professor Keith Hunter who will<br>tell us just a little bit more about<br>Professor thank you Vice Chancellor and<br>um as with the vice Chancellor this is<br>one of the most pleasurable parts of my<br>job I think this year I've had the<br>pleasure of intr producing 10 professors<br>in the division of Sciences uh whove<br>been promoted um this year and that's a<br>great<br>privilege Jamon uh was born in New York<br>City um but he grew up from the age of<br>two in Wilmington<br>Delaware and he went to uh get a ba<br>honors degree at Swarthmore College in<br>Pennsylvania which he completed in<br>1989 and then he went to work for a<br>while at the uniform services University<br>of the Health Sciences in Maryland<br>where his job was to administer cocaine<br>to squirrel<br>monkeys so that's the Genesis of his<br>career in Psychology he then went to<br>Indiana University and obtained his uh<br>PhD in 1996 and came soon after that uh<br>atago um Jam's research interests are<br>fairly eclectic and they include a<br>variety of topics in decision making and<br>emotion facial attractiveness and social<br>Char<br>categorization and the vice Chancellor<br>mentioned his um methodological work uh<br>so recently he's well known for<br>partnering with animation research<br>limited uh and filming groups of<br>students forming groups uh in foresight<br>Bar Stadium by filming from the roof<br>which I think is sounds pretty<br>Innovative um Jamon has been awarded the<br>New Zealand Association of scientists<br>research medal and the University's Carl<br>Smith medal now regular attendees at<br>these lectures know that I asked the<br>candidates for a interesting anecdote<br>about their life and this is the first<br>time I've had one that you would call a<br>crime<br>mystery it's called The Case of the<br>stolen<br>beard so in Jam's psych 202 class he has<br>a habit of um calling for suggestion and<br>comments from students which they place<br>in a little box somewhere on the lect<br>turn and he reads those and then<br>attempts to answer or deal with these<br>comments uh at the next lecture and one<br>of the comments he received was uh from<br>a student who said um I love your<br>beard now as it turned out this was<br>beard trimming evening so Jamon took<br>some of the beard trimmings and put them<br>in a little glossy bag and announced at<br>the lecture that it was available for<br>the student who said that she enjoyed<br>his<br>when when he got to the end of the<br>lecture to give her the glossy bag of<br>beard someone had stolen<br>it and who knows the person who did that<br>might well be in this<br>room so all joking aside um my<br>congratulations Jamon on your thoroughly<br>deserved promotion to professor and I<br>lecture thank you thank you Keith for<br>that uh yes embarrassing yet uh<br>humanizing anecdote I can't imagine how<br>you come up with these anecdotes all the<br>time um so I've been to a few of these<br>myself and uh actually I noticed no one<br>has given any anecdotes about<br>you so so uh well I don't want to take<br>time now but you well do you remember<br>the time we were doing it was the um we<br>were doing the Vodka Shots right and<br>there was the uh yeah and there was the<br>circus clown you know<br>and and the doctor said you know I can't<br>imagine how you got a bite on that part<br>of your body it just was anyway I'm not<br>going to go into it but definitely you<br>got to ask him because he was totally<br>he's totally crazy um right I want to<br>seriously though I really want to thank<br>you um Keith and Vern and Richard and uh<br>Kate barard all the people from the<br>division of science others Kate barard<br>Hi they from the division of Sciences<br>who have uh believed in me all these<br>years um I just I don't think you<br>mentioned I just got my first Marsden<br>Grant uh which is great and I'm very<br>grateful to the Marsen foundation for<br>that uh however it uh came after many<br>many many uh Marsen Grant<br>applications uh and through all that<br>time some the university did not see<br>that as failure but as uh promise so all<br>that time they've been funding my<br>funding my research and my work and I<br>think maybe the best thing about getting<br>the Mars is really to sort of pay back<br>some of that Goodwill that I've been uh<br>borrowing all these years so thanks for<br>um thanks for your support of me all<br>this time um harleen I want to give a<br>special thanks to you thank you for<br>coming back uh early or or on time I<br>don't know making it back for my making<br>it back for my talk harleen I don't know<br>sure if you remember this but harling's<br>the first person that I met at the<br>University it wasn't actually at the<br>University I was on my way to a job to<br>the job talk 1996 do you remember this<br>we were in yeah we were in LAX if you<br>spent any time in LAX you know you know<br>after a couple hours you're ready to you<br>know gouge your eye out with a spoon uh<br>but uh harlene was there and somehow<br>knew who I was and said just the right<br>thing then and she's kind of been saying<br>just the right thing for the past uh 18<br>years or so so I really hope that you<br>will remain the vice chair chor for<br>forever thank thank<br>you um and the university is just uh one<br>part one player in My Success um so I'm<br>not under any illusions that I'm the<br>only one responsible for my my success<br>in fact probably the least person least<br>responsible for My Success um I want to<br>especially thank need to thank a few<br>people before I get started on the<br>shipping news um the most of all I want<br>to thank my family<br>uh my wife Cindy Hall um it was it was<br>1990 I was um injecting monkeys with uh<br>cocaine Cindy was Cindy was uh<br>irradiating rats at the National<br>Institute of<br>Health and uh so it was sort of romance<br>was<br>inevitable um anyway so we've been ever<br>since we've been supporting each other<br>and each other's careers and uh I think<br>but I think probably she's done more of<br>the supporting than uh than I have so I<br>just so for the record I do want to give<br>Cindy credit she's a brilliant clinical<br>psychologist that gets sort of almost no<br>recognition for the work that she does<br>she has this spooky accurate intuition<br>that really complements uh my own<br>compromised uh social skills and uh<br>she's a great mother and kind of a solo<br>mother sometimes to our two great kids<br>Abigail and Paxton so I love you and and<br>thanks all you guys for supporting me<br>would not have done it or wanted to do<br>any of this without<br>you um so Cindy and I uh there no doubt<br>about it we lived a Charmed Life in New<br>Zealand we uh been here I think I think<br>18 years 18 or 19 years and uh we have a<br>great house you know friends great<br>careers um a lot of this would not be<br>possible without the people in the<br>psychology department and I want to<br>mention the<br>you can see how happy we are in the<br>psychology<br>department um so I um yeah I<br>really yeah I really I wanted to sort of<br>thank everybody and I actually started<br>going through the photo and to say like<br>oh this person did this and this person<br>did this and then on the first run<br>through the talk you know I was all the<br>way at the end of the talk already and I<br>hadn't even spoken of anything so I'm<br>afraid I'm really sorry I'm just going<br>to have to say thanks to everybody I<br>will come around if I haven't already<br>I'll come around to you individually to<br>say all the things you've done tell you<br>all the things you've done for us and to<br>thank you for that uh there is just a<br>couple people I did want to mention I<br>Lou<br>yeah Lou hi I haven't seen I didn't see<br>you anyway thanks for thanks a lot for<br>coming I haven't seen Lou for for well<br>probably a year already so so really<br>glad you're were able to make<br>it and um the other person I just really<br>wanted to single out was uh Jeff White<br>Jeff's um Jeff met me at the airport he<br>was hod at the time when I was hired met<br>me at the airport he uh you know he's he<br>helped us find a house he's attended our<br>wedding he actually attended my mother's<br>wedding I'm pretty sure<br>also it wasn't was he not there<br>yeah yeah no well my mother was married<br>and well I'm not not sure what's funny<br>about that but um anyway so Jeff and<br>then since all these years Jeff's been<br>just a great friend and uh mentor and um<br>benefactor and as you see him here he's<br>sort of always in the background I think<br>always I secretly think he's always<br>responsible for My Success so thanks a<br>lot Jeff and uh you know don't retire<br>too fully<br>please um I wasn't always at the<br>University of otago I had a life before<br>that and an academic life before that I<br>just want to mention briefly a couple<br>people who were influential<br>uh Barry Schwarz uh was my adviser at<br>Swarthmore College and his book The<br>Battle for human nature and his work on<br>economics and decision-making inspired<br>my interest in philosophy and psychology<br>I was actually a philosophy major at<br>Swarthmore and still resonates a lot in<br>my work today uh Paula neidenthal was my<br>advisor graduate adviser at Indiana<br>University and she taught me everything<br>I needed to know to succeed in the world<br>of international social<br>psychology now um where's is Elaine here<br>I just saw her yes elain I got this idea<br>from you thank you uh I I wanted to<br>trace back my my uh my intellectual<br>roots and turned out to be a little more<br>complicated than I than I realized so um<br>I'm not going to go through the whole<br>thing but I found some I was really<br>amazed humbled really to see like the<br>connections I had um so you know I only<br>have have sort of six people back to the<br>great William James wihelm V who is the<br>uh<br>really the first<br>psychologist um Kurt Luen who is<br>considered the father of um social<br>psychology and this is the greatest part<br>I discovered another father in here um<br>my father turns out to be I did not know<br>this but he was um a student of Dan Katz<br>at the University of Michigan in 1961 I<br>asked him about this he said uh he had<br>his thesis was uh worker veillance in<br>industrial job situations so um he was<br>was said he was so dispirited after<br>doing this that he gave up on psychology<br>and he pursued a degree in law at<br>Columbia University where uh he<br>eventually met my mother V Vivian<br>Silverman at Columbia's uh sister School<br>Barnard college and uh ultimately<br>leading to my appearance before you<br>today so were it not for cats's poor<br>supervision of my father uh I would<br>not now um I've also have my own<br>students now I've been really privileged<br>to uh Mentor a number of great students<br>I'm proud to say that all of them are<br>working in academics uh I guess it's<br>fair to say in one form or another um<br>Kamari I'm not sure if Kamari is here<br>but um is Kamari here okay there hi so<br>Kamari is um one of my earlier students<br>um she's um right now senior lecture in<br>our own Department of psychological<br>medicine and she's been co-supervising<br>uh with with me she co-supervised ozra<br>with me is ozra here oh oh wow this this<br>great for you all to come so ozra I've<br>got to mention because she is the only<br>student I've ever had who is working on<br>her thesis actually while giving birth<br>to a so so it's it's really it's<br>literally there's like you know analysis<br>of variants on this page like list of<br>contractions on the side so it was and<br>unfortunate well I guess fortunately but<br>unfortunately for the thesis the baby<br>came a little early was born I don't<br>know couple three days ago four days ago<br>um so anyway but I'm confident that<br>she'll um finish up the thesis after<br>that oh thanks for coming so each of<br>these students uh they've been students<br>but they've also been ultimately um<br>collaborators really and they've shaped<br>my own thinking and uh research<br>trajectory and um Jonathan Jong who's<br>here uh as harleen mentioned came out<br>from he's at Oxford now probably best<br>example in this regard because he's<br>really turned shaped a lot of my<br>thinking and sort of um led me to a lot<br>of my research toward issues of um<br>religious cognition and death anxiety<br>and<br>rituals uh actually it's John and a<br>former postdoc Matias bloomy who is at<br>heidleberg<br>um we are co-pis on the Marsden project<br>which um looks at the relationship<br>between death anxiety and religious<br>belief and then finally uh I just want<br>mention the rest of my lab um is really<br>uh is a bit more students here than than<br>I've ever had in the past it's a really<br>great group we've been running really<br>hot in the in the lab we've had dozens<br>and dozens of research on all sorts of<br>things social psychology<br>related um so we've in addition to the<br>religion and ritual stuff which we do a<br>lot of um we do study emotion uh we<br>study risk perception social networks um<br>moral cognition<br>um TR perception of Truth and beauty<br>face perception stereotypes bias and um<br>I want to just thank everyone for uh<br>making my work so enjoyable and uh I'm<br>really looking forward to seeing where<br>you all uh take me<br>next so um unfortunately I'm not going<br>to talk about any of those things today<br>instead I'm going to just focus on um<br>one aspect of my work uh which I call<br>the shipping news uh no it's not any PR<br>pure prizewinning novel about new life<br>and love in New Finland it's the<br>shipping<br>news right this uh what's wrong are you<br>not<br>hip to ship means to support or endorse<br>a pairing of two individuals that is not<br>canon in the works in which they<br>appear it's tween for relationship is<br>that right<br>Abby so for example if you wanted to<br>take the old Captain Kirk and the new<br>Captain Kirk right you could create a<br>new kind of combination of Captain Kirks<br>that would be a ship of Captain<br>Kirks right so that is the hip way of<br>saying um relationship and I am<br>definitely<br>hip uh right so some ship some other<br>ships you might be familiar with um<br>brangelina right<br>nter yeah I think I<br>think<br>I<br>anyway I think<br>um actually I think that guy was in<br>Hairspray um right so these are they're<br>a little weird I mean some of them are a<br>little weird photographs and but the<br>reason that they're weird is actually<br>tells you something really profound or<br>at least interesting about face<br>perception and the interaction between<br>emotion and cognition that's what I'll<br>eventually get back to um in the time I<br>have but to take a step back um they're<br>they are weird but the fact that they're<br>weird is um is really uh is a exception<br>really to the rule the rule being that<br>when you take two faces and you blend<br>them<br>together right the um result you get is<br>a face that is um gener more attractive<br>than either of the faces the original<br>faces from which it was<br>created right and furthermore as you add<br>faces to the composite the face gets<br>increasingly more attractive until you<br>eventually ASM toote um in<br>attractiveness oops one more here right<br>so they gradually get more attractive<br>and you can see what's happening it's<br>nothing like miraculous it's just that<br>the faces are losing all of their<br>distinctive characteristics and you're<br>left with this sort of blander but yet<br>somehow more attractive individual<br>person someone who has a whose face is<br>more fac likee than the originals but<br>yet um but yet more attractive now um<br>you can do this so so there's a<br>relationship between the averaging of<br>two faces and and its attractiveness you<br>can do this in other ways as well you<br>can ask people to rate how faik a<br>person's face is and you get independent<br>people to judge how attractive the<br>individuals are so in this case this is<br>actually originally a a group of 50<br>individual women um so the most<br>attractive uh person is down there on<br>the left and the person judged least<br>attractive was on the right and um an<br>independent group of people judged these<br>these two also to be among the most the<br>most attractive one was among the most<br>uh had the most fa-like face most<br>typical average looking face and the<br>least attractive woman um was among<br>those who had the least typical faces<br>and the correlation for those are you<br>keeping score was about s between judged<br>averageness and judged attractiveness so<br>about half of the variance in facial<br>attractiveness of these women was<br>accounted for by how um typical the<br>person's face<br>was um you can also do this within an<br>individual I I've never these are brand<br>new not brand new they're new data I've<br>never shown them before actually John uh<br>collected these as a third-year student<br>I've never shown them anywhere before<br>but in honor of his visiting I was going<br>to show you that you can you can uh ask<br>people to find the um most attractive<br>Paul McCartney who turns out to be uh<br>1963 McCartney uh and the least<br>attractive McCartney which turns out to<br>be 1997<br>McCartney Right and again the the<br>correlation and the correlation here is<br>um only about 04 so it's not as strong<br>but yet there is a significant<br>relationship between how good example<br>McCartney is these McCartney photos are<br>of<br>McCartney and how um Attractive people<br>find U individual image of<br>McCartney um John lenon uh famous<br>infamously I guess said that the Beatles<br>were uh more famous than Jesus however<br>uh it's Jesus who has a stronger<br>relationship though between averageness<br>and attractiveness so it turns out that<br>uh if you ask people to rate photos of<br>Jesus on uh on terms of how attractive<br>he is um I feel I may have ventured into<br>dangerous<br>water so anyway the 60s kind of Barry<br>Gibb Jesus is the is the most judged to<br>be the most attractive and the sort of<br>10th Century Jesus is the least<br>attractive and the correlation between<br>Jesus's how typical of a image Jesus is<br>and how appealing people find the the<br>image is about 08 in Jesus photos know<br>you know I'm not the I'm not the first<br>person to play around with morphing and<br>averaging faces um that is usually<br>attributed to Francis Gul<br>Francis gton was uh Darwin's half well<br>I'm not really sure half cousin or<br>second cousin or something they shared<br>apparently they shared a grandfather<br>arasmus um now gton wasn't much in the<br>beard Department uh however he did have<br>like incredible sideburns I have to say<br>um so Dar uh sorry gton um was 22 when<br>his his father died and left him a<br>fortune and he gave up a career as a uh<br>in medicine to live a life of leisure<br>and uh at that time you it was a time<br>when you could pretty much know<br>everything there was to know and that's<br>what gton did and he also um also<br>extended knowledge in all sorts of<br>domains really um<br>remarkable um how many scientific<br>domains he contributed to he's credited<br>with the invention of the questionnaire<br>uh the nature nurture debate The<br>Sciences of fingerprinting and<br>meteorology uh standard deviation<br>electrocardiogram um dog whistle like<br>goes on and on all the stuff that he's<br>done among those things he invented a<br>way of combining images uh to create<br>composite photographs here's some of his<br>work right now what he was really<br>interested in um was to determine if<br>certain um certain um behavioral traits<br>were associated with certain um uh<br>physical characteristics this is the<br>science in quotes now of eugenics which<br>another one of one another one of um<br>galton's Creations um so uh I think the<br>idea is that uh if you can um if if a<br>particular Behavior say in this case<br>Larsen without violence um is associated<br>with a particular trait and if you get<br>people who have committed these offenses<br>and you average them all together what<br>should come out is that that that<br>particular trait um and then once you<br>can identify what that trait is you<br>might be able to select selectively<br>breed that trait out of the population<br>and thereby get rid of larsy without<br>violence um so as you uh can probably<br>imagine the end of the story he didn't<br>manage to find that particular trait uh<br>one thing he did notice though was sort<br>of counterintuitively as he combined<br>these faces together uh they became more<br>and more um attractive um this is what<br>uh gton says the special villainous<br>irregularities in the indiv ual have<br>disappeared and the common Humanity that<br>underlies them has prevailed um they<br>represent not the criminal but the man<br>who is liable to fall into crime right<br>so he sees this that that um as you<br>combine these people whatever their<br>their particular negative traits or<br>characteristics actually all fall away<br>and sort of the innate beautiful core<br>comes comes forward um so nowadays um<br>you know you can do this of course with<br>digital photogra digital imaging you<br>know in two dozen you know free apps on<br>the computer you can morph anyone you<br>want with anyone else and a lot of<br>people do this and there's a lot of<br>discussion you know some people uh you<br>know artists do artists do this<br>philosophers have something to say about<br>this futurists have something to say<br>about this um this is artist Mike<br>Mike guy who's so great that his you<br>have to say his name twice um anyway<br>what he did was uh take photographs of<br>people in different cities um supposedly<br>randomly chosen off the street he<br>averaged them together he calls and he<br>as you can see the attractiveness effect<br>emerging clearly here the resulting<br>images are attractive people um you um<br>yeah he calls us the face of<br>tomorrow so the seem like I mean seems<br>like the face of today because he took<br>the photos today but anyway uh it's the<br>face of tomorrow and um so you know so<br>artists have things to say about about<br>the attractiveness of but so do<br>psychologists and researchers and um<br>this has been a big um deal in<br>evolutionary psychology especially<br>because evolutionary psychologists<br>whenever um whenever attractiveness is<br>at stake evolutionary psychologists<br>weigh in they ask why what would be the<br>function of being attracted to someone<br>who is has a relatively average face and<br>some of the answers have been well um<br>averageness is a signal of some sort of<br>some sort of sign of reproductive<br>Fitness<br>heterozygosity variability and uh gen<br>and uh genetic variability um resistance<br>to<br>disease uh um Childhood Health there's<br>actually some weak data on Childhood<br>Health apparently that um your health<br>sorry your uh averageness of your face<br>as a child predicts weakly your um<br>Health as an<br>adult um<br>but uh I've always been sort of a<br>evolutionary psychological skeptic not<br>that I'm a evolutionary skeptic but um<br>but I've always been suspicious about<br>how easily easy it is to spin a<br>evolutionary psychological tale about<br>why something why a particular<br>phenomenon exists and in this particular<br>case I I have to say owls right and I<br>say owls because there are owls on the<br>um on the overheads but I also say owls<br>because um I have run the same study uh<br>that I've did with faces I showed you<br>before um with owls and a number of<br>other stimuli and what you find is the<br>exact same phenomenon<br>so the most attractive Owl and the least<br>attractive owl uh are turn out to be<br>also the owls that people judged to be<br>very typical of owls and very atypical<br>of owls and has nothing and it's not<br>related to owls or faces or anything you<br>do the same thing with human artifacts<br>um here's a paper from old paper from<br>psychological science where we compared<br>the uh most attract asked people to<br>judge the attractiveness of wrist<br>watches the most attractive wristwatch<br>and the least attractive wristwatch turn<br>out to be the wrist watches that people<br>believe are the best examples of wrist<br>watches uh and the and the worst<br>examples of wrist watches respectively<br>so it turns out that for horses and<br>handguns elephants um butterflies uh<br>literally almost every category that<br>we've studied uh has this relationship<br>um that we and we call this the beauty<br>and averess effect a ter term that I<br>coined with u my collaborator one of my<br>collaborators poot<br>VLAN um so this is a general a tendency<br>to prefer category members that are<br>better examples of their<br>group okay so and besides discovering<br>and naming this effect we've been really<br>interested in trying to explain it not<br>from an evolutionary uh perspective<br>because of course unless you have a very<br>you know warped uh mate preferences it's<br>you know it's not a very parsimonious<br>explanation to say that you're attracted<br>to you know average things because they<br>signal reproductive Fitness but um from<br>a from a cognitive perspective what's<br>the proximate mechanism um that links<br>averageness to attractiveness so we call<br>this a mediator so what is causally<br>something might be causally related to<br>both averageness and<br>attractiveness that uh that explains the<br>relationship between the two and one<br>particular mediator that we've been<br>really interested<br>in is uh what I call fluency so fluency<br>is um the ease with which a stimulus can<br>be perceived Andor<br>processed um so for example you know so<br>I hold this up I say what is this in the<br>time it takes you to perceive that a<br>it's a glass Empty Glass uh and to tell<br>me it's an empty glass that's that has<br>some amount of time associated with it<br>that amount of time can be measured and<br>that is uh a combination of several<br>processes but overall that's your<br>processing fluency for for a uh for a<br>glass um so the reason we focused on<br>fluency and the reason fluency is a good<br>um candidate to explain the beauty and<br>averageness effect is because um on the<br>one hand category prototypes things that<br>are good examples of their group are uh<br>fluent so these are um paintings by uh<br>denan artist Tony ter<br>shevitz um so you I don't know you may<br>like or dislike Tony tz's style but he<br>does have a style right and if you study<br>his paintings for a little while and<br>close your eyes you can kind of imagine<br>what that style you can kind of imagine<br>you know what the prototypical Tony<br>painting would be and if I showed you<br>new paintings you'd be able to uh tell<br>me how similar each of these new<br>paintings is to that prototype Tony<br>Terra shevitz painting So if you uh plot<br>those judgments the typicality of a<br>particular painting as a Tony tabers<br>shevitz painting and you plot that<br>against the time that it's required for<br>independent people to Independent people<br>to tell you that the painting is<br>actually painted by Tony Tera shevitz<br>you see this negative um relationship so<br>that negative relationship is a is the<br>um means that the uh more<br>typical uh a painting is the more the<br>faster people are to decide that it is<br>painted by that guy it's that's<br>classification<br>fluency so um<br>so if if uh typical um stimuli are more<br>fluent um that's one piece of the puzzle<br>and it also turns out that fluency is<br>closely associated with liking<br>so PE I've written in this in this<br>ironically hardto read font uh people<br>tend to dislike things when they are<br>hard to perceive or understand compared<br>to when they are relatively easy so this<br>is a fluency is a really interesting<br>variable actually no no one actually<br>really knows why this is the case that<br>that fluent uh things that are made<br>fluent or that are fluent um are judged<br>more positively but it's a it's true um<br>uh there are many studies with really<br>interesting interesting approaches<br>interesting phenomena um for example uh<br>my my colleague I mentioned P winlan he<br>uh showed that just simple manipulation<br>of fluency by changing the the uh<br>contrast increases liking people prefer<br>the high contrast Circle over the low<br>contrast Circle um I mentioned that um I<br>mentioned that already that uh people<br>don't like hard to read um uh hard to<br>read<br>handwriting um they also don't like hard<br>to understand handwriting uh so there's<br>a study by uh<br>Oppenheimer um that uh where they<br>Oppenheimer presented um participants<br>with um with uh sentences that that<br>appear that uh were supposedly for uh<br>applications for graduate school right<br>and either simple or comp difficult<br>complex disfluent sentences so a simple<br>sentence might be Psychology was a<br>really valuable class because I<br>discovered plenty of facts that<br>accounted for what I was like when I was<br>younger so it's it's not going to win<br>the pure prize but it's you know but<br>it's at least understandable fairly<br>simple especially in comparison to the<br>complex version which is psychology was<br>a genuinely beneficial Educational<br>Opportunity considering I unearth the<br>wealth of insight that hallucinated my<br>demeanor as a developmentally early<br>stage so um what what Oppenheimer found<br>is that um despite using all these big<br>words in complex language PE the um the<br>writers who used these these words were<br>actually judged to be stupider uh than<br>the people who used the simple language<br>and were judged as less suitable for uh<br>for graduate school in fact these<br>particular sentences I've got up here<br>actually were created by my student<br>Helen Owen who's here today and um what<br>Helen has shown actually is that not<br>only are these uh not that she's<br>replicated this effect but also found<br>that the simpler sentences are judged is<br>more likely to be true and uh if you<br>hold statistically constant the<br>perceived truth value of the sentences<br>the writers of those sentences are Jud<br>judged as more uh more likely more<br>honest um and what she's doing for her<br>PhD is trying to reverse this effect so<br>actually constraining people's uh<br>language use so forcing people to write<br>in a simpler way and asking whether that<br>will influence their perceived honesty<br>of them their own self-perception of<br>honesty and whether they will actually<br>behave in a more honest way um when<br>they're forced to use simpler language<br>so it's really interesting work and<br>actually if you want to hear her talk on<br>it um you should and in fact a lot of<br>students from psychology will be<br>speaking on Thursday if I just put a<br>plugin uh Thursday it's<br>psycholo uh at the uh University College<br>so um so just check our website and um<br>you can come breakfast I think it was a<br>free breakfast<br>involved um so my um my favorite study<br>on fluency actually is this one by song<br>and Schwarz I just have to mention this<br>because it's the song and Schwarz ask<br>people to judge the how much they think<br>they would like uh different amusement<br>park rides and the amusement park rides<br>were randomly associated with either<br>fluent names so names that were sort of<br>easy to perceive and and ounce or uh<br>disfluent names and people judge the<br>fluent fluently named rides like the<br>chunta as uh more probably more<br>enjoyable and less likely to make them<br>throw up than the same rides that when<br>they were assigned to a disfluent with a<br>toishi so um so coming back to our<br>original question a bit of a sideline<br>here but com back to the original<br>question um so we've so we have found<br>that um stimuli that are are um closer<br>to the central tendency of their<br>category that are more average uh tend<br>to be processed more easily things that<br>are processed more easily uh tend to be<br>um liked more and so we have a mechanism<br>potentially for the beauty and<br>averageness effect which would be that<br>when you get a blended face the Blended<br>face is easier on the eyes basically<br>it's easier to see it's more typical<br>more easily processed face that uh gives<br>you a some boost in positivity relative<br>to the original faces and it turns out<br>that this is sort of true uh but not<br>entirely true and the story is is<br>actually much more um complex and<br>complex in a really interesting way I<br>think because um a morphed face uh like<br>anything is an example of multiple<br>categories so um Arnold Schwarzenegger<br>right Arnold Schwarzenegger is a great<br>example of the category of action hero<br>or whatever actions actor I guess action<br>star I guess he's not actually an action<br>hero anyway um he's uh anyway so Arnold<br>chener is a good example of Action Hero<br>he's you know not so good of an example<br>of the category of um politician right<br>even though he is in that category he is<br>a member of the category of<br>politician um I guess since his<br>extramarital affair he is uh more a<br>better example of a<br>politician thank<br>you um anyway um so this would so you<br>would predict that you'd be e it would<br>be easier to uh to recognize to decide<br>that Arnold Schwarzenegger was an action<br>hero than he was you are to decide that<br>he is a politician and you you'd predict<br>that uh you'd be judge him more<br>positively when you think of him as a<br>politician sorry as an action hero than<br>as a politician so in terms of the um<br>morphed faces here although it is the<br>case that the Blended face is a good<br>example of the category of<br>faces uh is actually not a very good<br>example of either of the two faces that<br>went into the morph so he both the morph<br>faces both a good example and a poor<br>example at the same time and what we've<br>shown is that um by changing the<br>implicit category structure comparing<br>like sort of what group the face is seen<br>to be an example of you can reduce or<br>even reverse this um Beauty and<br>averageness effect now this is not just<br>some esoteric uh well it is an esoteric<br>phenomenon but it's not just an esoteric<br>phenomenon related to faces because<br>people there are real genuine natural<br>morphed people in the form of people who<br>have multiple um racial or other<br>identities and it turns out that<br>biracial and multi-racial individuals<br>are very attractive I know this sounds<br>like like almost borderline racist but<br>it's it's a certified true fact uh that<br>if you if you blend two faces uh two<br>faces from dist of distinctly different<br>racial groups in the laboratory the<br>resulting morph is more attractive than<br>either the individual faces but also<br>more attractive than um the same than a<br>morph of two same race individuals so<br>it's not clear again why this is a good<br>hypothesis based on our work is that a<br>blended face cross race fa race morph is<br>uh a particularly good example of the<br>category of faces the set of faces to<br>which you've been exposed in your<br>lifetime but importantly um according to<br>our reasoning here this should only be<br>true so it only be attractive as long as<br>the individuals are not seen as member<br>of their constituent racial groups so in<br>other words Hal Berry is a beautiful<br>woman perhaps not so beautiful of an<br>African-American woman and we've<br>actually shown this a paper coming out<br>uh next month um Journal of experimental<br>social psychology that the appeal of<br>racial Blends reverses when they're seen<br>as members of their constituent racial<br>groups you can do the same thing with um<br>gender Justin Bieber right you can like<br>love him or hate him love him or hate<br>him Abby okay verdict is hate him but um<br>whether you love him or hate him may<br>depend on whether you see him as a human<br>or<br>as literally as a human being or as a<br>man right and I have to say with the<br>facial hair lacking I'm not so keen on<br>the latter category<br>either um so um so uh we created in the<br>lab our own Justin bavers basically we<br>Blended um we created morphs uh of of<br>male and femal uh blends to 10 different<br>degrees and we asked people to rate the<br>attractiveness of these uh of these<br>morphs okay and uh half of the<br>participants before they rated the<br>attractiveness of the<br>morphs right they um they were asked to<br>categorize the individual so they had to<br>say just right before rating they had to<br>say is this a male or a female that's<br>all the and then they rated how<br>attractive the person was and the<br>control group also rated also um C oriz<br>the faces but they did so um they<br>categorized it on a on a gender<br>irrelevant<br>Dimension okay so in the control group<br>what you find is that um a more or less<br>linear preference for feminized faces<br>this is actually a common finding in the<br>face perception literature there's<br>there's a all things being equal people<br>have a preference for feminized over<br>masculinized features but when people<br>have to classify that you see this<br>effect but laid on top top of that is<br>this great um<br>nonlinearity right so um so people don't<br>like The Ambiguously gendered faces but<br>only when they have find when they have<br>to classify the faces in terms of gender<br>and the dislike for these people is<br>mediated uh by their fluency by how<br>difficult it is to categorize them this<br>is another study that Helen Owens Helen<br>Owen is uh working on with<br>me um the dis fluid<br>of multiply categorizable stimuli uh can<br>also occur naturally if the competing<br>categories are sufficiently Salient um<br>and that's why I believe that these are<br>so-called anamorphs right that's why<br>people don't find Animorphs especially<br>attractive right or interesting they're<br>they find them a little bit weird and<br>creepy right which weird and creepy<br>to<br>uh to the guy from Hairspray<br>right um so um the reason that I think<br>that we find this a little bit dis<br>disturbing is because we can see the<br>original people in the in the morph<br>right so it is it is hard to see the<br>face as something as a member of a<br>higher level group or as an example of<br>the faces that you've encountered<br>because you're you're sort of um pulled<br>by your recognition of the individuals<br>in the more if you can't get rid of that<br>that um that automatic<br>categorization and you don't have to<br>take my word for this because uh we have<br>a study actually that shows this where<br>um we showed people um blends of<br>well-known celebrities okay uh two kiwis<br>and um the New Zealand participants<br>found the um face on the top to be<br>especially weird and creepy and they<br>found the one on the bottom to be rather<br>attractive um the only difference<br>between they all they're both morphs of<br>famous celebrities uh but the top one is<br>a famous New Zealand celebrities right<br>blend of um of uh who's that Suzanne<br>Paul and Helen Clark it's like the peak<br>of my career this year was that they<br>actually interviewed Suzanne Paul about<br>this about these images and uh what' she<br>say she said it GES gives me the heebie<br>jibbies what she<br>said U I guess Helen Clark no no comment<br>from Helen Clark um so the so the um and<br>the image on the bottom is also a morph<br>of two famous celebrities but they're<br>famous in the Netherlands right uh it's<br>Shantel janszen and Bridget<br>Mand all right so the interesting thing<br>is that although the New Zealand<br>participants show this pattern we also<br>ran the study in the Netherlands right<br>and they show the this is the best data<br>ever it showed the<br>exactly reversed pattern right they they<br>think that the that the Jans in masand<br>morph is really weird looking and they<br>find the the um Helen Clark morph is is<br>pretty attractive in fact they rate that<br>they rate the middle one is more<br>attractive more appealing than either of<br>the two individual<br>faces<br>um I doing on time all right um I just<br>I'll tell you just leave you with just<br>one more um one more set of studies uh<br>this is the most recent area we've<br>gotten into in this sort of line of<br>research uh with two of my master<br>students uh Sam O Sullivan and David<br>Barton um it turns out that you can be a<br>better or worse example of<br>yourself right or at least of your own<br>name and that's because people's names<br>well names of things uh contrary to<br>popular belief I guess is uh are not<br>arbitrary so people have a preference<br>for certain names o to um represent<br>certain at least certain shapes<br>so um this is a studyy this phenomenon's<br>been known for a while but um this<br>particular example comes from Ram<br>Shandra and hubard um so they ask people<br>here are two shapes um which one is do<br>you think one of them is buba and one of<br>them is Kiki so which one do you think<br>is buba and which one is<br>Kiki uh I won't wait for the answer<br>because I know what you're going to say<br>because almost everyone says the same<br>thing that most people believe that the<br>rounded shape is BBA and the spiky shape<br>is more likely to be Kiki right so what<br>Sam Mo Sullivan discovered though is<br>that you can repair these names right<br>you can introduce people to a rounded<br>shape whose name happens to be Kiki<br>right and when you do that people<br>develop a dislike for that shape right<br>in actually unconscious it's an<br>unconscious dislike we actually use a<br>it's called an implicit attitude measure<br>and you can see that they associate<br>negative things with that shape they<br>don't like things that have the wrong<br>name um what David Barton uh extended<br>This research to show is that individual<br>people also have rounded and spiky<br>heads right and uh just as with the<br>shapes you can introduce someone to a a<br>person named Bubba or Mickey and if you<br>introduce someone to a round-headed<br>Mickey they develop a dislike for um the<br>round-headed<br>Mickey um so uh it's not really clear at<br>this point whether this is an actual<br>fluency effect so in other words um<br>maybe people find it um just a little<br>bit difficult to process a person's face<br>or remember a person's face or to learn<br>a person's face uh when they have<br>mismatching names or whether there's<br>something um it's more closely related<br>to um synesthesia says something even<br>more profound about our um neural<br>circuitry um but regardless of the cause<br>um we're well we I should say David<br>really has developed um a method for<br>quantifying this so you can for so for<br>any individual one of you we can measure<br>uh how rounded your face is versus spiky<br>your face is and we can also measure how<br>rounded or spiky your name is and<br>thereby create sort of a quotient a<br>rounded or matching quotient and with<br>that then we can go do archival research<br>we can ask things like um is a person<br>more likely to be um to be trusted or to<br>be elected or to be paroled if they have<br>a mismatching versus a matching name so<br>that's just some interesting work that<br>we're um getting into<br>now um I had to mention Sam was at a<br>Herculean effort in developing this uh<br>this Paradigm which took a um worked for<br>probably what three years on a on a<br>two-year Masters just developing these<br>developing this these um rounded and<br>spiky<br>shapes um<br>okay so<br>um well all right I know what you're<br>thinking you're<br>thinking uh are they going to have those<br>little potato canish things at the at<br>the reception and I cannot tell you what<br>you will taste at the reception but I<br>hope I've given you a<br>uh of my of my own just some of the many<br>projects that we do and some of the<br>stuff that we can accomplish with a<br>brilliant set of graduate student<br>students and uh great support from a<br>great University so that's all I have to<br>attention thank you so much<br>Jamon uh my name is David bulky I'm the<br>um current head of Department of uh<br>psychology<br>uh I think it's been very clear tonight<br>that um Jamon is running a just a<br>fantastic research program and just it's<br>clear just how Innovative and creative<br>it is great ideas and um as a result of<br>that I think you're that's clearly<br>paying off in terms of the number of<br>students that you have in your<br>lab now of course um this is what you're<br>seeing tonight as a result of a number<br>of years of research and that's result<br>in many many outcomes in the in the<br>literature for example Jamon has over 50<br>Journal articles and high ranking<br>journals um 14 book chapters um<br>including um three of those those<br>articles are in psychological science in<br>the last five years in psychological<br>Sciences the premier journal in this<br>area uh and just very recently uh Jamon<br>has just I'm not sure if he signed it<br>but he's certainly been offered a book<br>deal uh with bloomsberry press write a<br>book about uh some of this works I think<br>that's that's<br>great um if you if you kind of look back<br>over the last few years I think the<br>signs have always been there to indicate<br>that Jam's career his research career Is<br>On The Rise um back in 2007 Jamon won<br>the roath and Carl Smith medal and<br>that's a medal given in recognition of<br>outstanding research performance uh in<br>early career<br>staff he was made a fellow of the<br>experimental social psychology uh in<br>2009 and a fellow of the association for<br>psychological science in 2011 so<br>certainly all the signs have been there<br>time to be promoted to Professor you not<br>only have to excel in research but you<br>also have to be uh a very good teacher<br>and you have to work very hard in your<br>uh your support for the University and<br>your Administration um but certainly in<br>terms of uh teaching um jam and teaches<br>some very well-rated undergraduate and<br>uh graduate<br>courses he's uh he has six phds that<br>have completed 14 msc's seven current<br>phds and five current<br>msc's Jamon has been a four time<br>finalist for the ousa super uh<br>supervisor of the Year award and in 2007<br>he was actually winner of that award and<br>I think again that's recognition of the<br>outstanding effort uh in his<br>teaching Jamon has provided service to<br>the university and Community um<br>particularly in in the area of science<br>communication as he mentioned he's he's<br>done a number of very high-profile<br>interviews on uh different media Outlets<br>uh he's also been associate editor of<br>psychological science that's that<br>prestigious Journal uh since<br>2012 but of course above all that um the<br>thing that I really think of when I<br>think of Jamon is just he's been a great<br>member of the department he has an<br>intellectual strength that really stands<br>out and an ability to see through into<br>the core ideas that under underly themes<br>and to get to the underpinnings of them<br>and and I'm sure that's partly a result<br>of his training in philosophy and it's<br>actually a nice way to see that the way<br>that the humanities and the Sciences uh<br>can work together<br>there as you would have seen from uh<br>Jam's work and as Keith mentioned um<br>it's very creative um and Jamon is<br>actually a very creative guy he comes<br>from a creative family um Cindy is a<br>very talented photographer he has two<br>very talented children and that's<br>obviously rubbed off he's creative in<br>many ways he makes great bread he plays<br>the saxophone very well um<br>and he he just comes up with these<br>really great experimental ideas and as<br>Keith mentioned you know one of the most<br>recent ones is putting together the idea<br>of working in the<br>stadium with the fact and one of the<br>things that's special about the stadium<br>is it's a covered Stadium Stadium which<br>makes it very easy to put cameras uh up<br>on the roof and actually to to look down<br>and see the way that people are moving<br>and so he's taken that fact and put it<br>together with the fact that in Den Eden<br>we have uh animation research limited um<br>who specializes in tracking objects and<br>people and he's taken those two things<br>together and he's gone down to see ARL<br>and to talk to them and now he has this<br>project going whereby people groups of<br>people go into the stadium and they're<br>given particular task to do and there's<br>a camera overhead which is monitoring<br>them and they're able to be TR all every<br>individual is tracked individually and<br>so you can see that the way that groups<br>structure and coalescent and fall apart<br>again now it's interesting I I noticed<br>looking back through the the journal<br>articles that Jamon had written over the<br>last few years there's if you sort of<br>look at the titles um some of the early<br>ones were fairly straightforward and<br>mundane preps but in about the last five<br>years he's there's this again this<br>development of creativity has come up<br>with some great ideas or great paper<br>titles for example death and<br>deities when good Blends go<br>bad scaring the be Jesus out of people<br>oh sorry scaring the be Jesus into<br>people and one um that's so good that I<br>think you got almost WRA to it um easy<br>on the eyes are hard to<br>categorize oh yeah oh yeah<br>wave your hands in the air and tell me<br>that you<br>care some people you should just never<br>give a microphone<br>to um the other aspect over and above<br>the creativity is also persistence um I<br>mentioned the study um with the stadium<br>and working with ARL<br>um uh Ian Taylor um who runs ARL uh is<br>not an easy man to get in touch with<br>because any particular time he can be<br>just anywhere in the world Berlin London<br>New York and he travels a lot and and I<br>know that it was actually quite<br>difficult for Jam to kind of keep up<br>with that and to kind of keep on with<br>this to make sure this happened but he<br>did that and uh really it occurred over<br>a period of about a year but eventually<br>it it paid<br>off um also um as I think was mentioned<br>earlier I mean Jamon had just won this<br>great maren Grant but that required a<br>lot of persistence these grants are<br>actually very difficult to get it's only<br>a low U low percentage each year of of<br>applicants actually get these Awards uh<br>these grants and um but Jamon persisted<br>over a number of years and um it's great<br>to see that pay<br>off so Jamon um congratulations on your<br>promotion and congratulations for giving<br>a wonderful uh talk tonight and a talk I<br>think that's made it very clear as to<br>why you so richly deserve to be standing<br>in front of us tonight so I'd like you<br>to join me um in thanking him and also<br>on behalf of the University I'd like to<br>appreciation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
