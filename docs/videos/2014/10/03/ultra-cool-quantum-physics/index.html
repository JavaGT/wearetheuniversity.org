harleen<br>Hayne and I'm the vice Chancellor here<br>at the University of itago and it's my<br>great pleasure to warmly welcome you to<br>this inaugural professorial lecture as<br>with all of our lectures it's fantastic<br>to see um staff and students from the<br>University of itago but it's also<br>fascinating to see members of the<br>general public and I would like to<br>extend a very warm welcome to members of<br>the Blakey family particularly um the<br>the children Blakey which I assume are<br>in the<br>excellent great so we are so glad to<br>have you here um and we Jo join with you<br>in your enthusiasm about your father's<br>promotion um like all professors here at<br>the University of itago um Professor<br>Blakey has had to jump over some pretty<br>large hoops in order to get to this<br>point but I think you will all agree<br>after listening to his lecture this<br>evening he has more um than satisfied<br>the criterian for promotion to Professor<br>he has demonstrated very clearly his<br>outstanding ability in research um he<br>has a very long list of High Caliber<br>Publications the citations of his work<br>have climbed to over 1,000 and they grow<br>by more than 150 citations each year<br>he's also the recipient of three highly<br>coveted Marsen GR grants as a pi um<br>which is an amazing feat for anyone but<br>in addition to his research caliber um<br>Blair is also an outstanding teacher um<br>he has taught across the entire<br>curriculum from first year to fourth<br>year level papers um he supervises<br>post-graduate students and a large Cadre<br>of PhD students he's the recipient of an<br>ousa teaching award and the teaching<br>evaluations um by his students are<br>uniform extraordinarily<br>high but he's also excelled in service<br>and I think this is a really important<br>area that sometimes we don't highlight<br>at the beginning of these inaugural<br>professorial lectures um he's excelled<br>in traditional ways of highlevel service<br>um he's been on the Mars evaluation<br>panel um he served on the itago research<br>grants physical sciences panel he's been<br>the director of the Vulcan computational<br>cluster at itago and has served on the<br>itago Nessie Steering group but I think<br>the other thing that is really important<br>to highlight here is that um Professor<br>Blakey has also participated in the<br>communication of highlevel science to<br>members of the community he's developed<br>two NCA curriculum posters that have<br>been distributed to every High School in<br>New Zealand he ran the physics after<br>school program from 2004 to 2007 and<br>he's a very frequent contributor to the<br>ask a science Forum that appears in many<br>of the newspapers throughout New Zealand<br>so AC across all three areas at which we<br>evaluate individuals for promotion to<br>this rank I think that you will all<br>agree that he is clearly met and<br>exceeded even our very strenuous<br>University of Vago criteria I would now<br>like to call on the pro Vice Chancellor<br>of Sciences Professor Keith Hunter to<br>tell us just a little bit more about<br>Professor thank you thank you thank you<br>Vice Chancellor and um may I say again<br>that um this is one of the highlights of<br>my job uh introducing the new professors<br>from<br>science um BL was born and raised in<br>inago and in 1994 he came to the<br>University of Vago and he enrolled in a<br>first year program that simultaneously<br>fulfilled the conditions of engineering<br>intermediate Health Science intermediate<br>and a BSC majoring in either physics or<br>today on uh February the 27th 1995 at<br>9:00<br>a.m. he embarked on his quest to serve<br>Humanity by enrolling in the uh MB chb<br>medicine<br>program at 10:00 on the same morning he<br>ended his quest to serve<br>humanity and strolled over to the<br>science 3 building where Jerry<br>Carrington I imagine gratefully enrolled<br>him in a honors program uh in physics<br>Blair confesses that he actually<br>preferred chemistry and I'm not<br>surprised at that but he had an<br>inability to perform experiments which<br>um I can attest is a somewhat of an<br>imped to studying chemistry during his<br>Physics degree he um he was a<br>scholarship holder from the New Zealand<br>aluminium smelters company and for three<br>Summers he worked at the Ty Point<br>smelter now the smelter had a policy of<br>placing um University students in parts<br>of the organization where they could<br>best use their skills so as a physics<br>student uh he worked 12-hour shifts in<br>the rotting room and the rotting room as<br>we use a sledgehammer and a crowbar to<br>break slag off<br>the anodes or rods so that can be<br>reused 1998 he he had completed his<br>degree and he began a<br>PhD uh again at atago under the<br>supervision of Rob Bella with<br>considerable input from um Chrisman<br>Gardner who who at the time was a<br>self-employed physicist in Wellington<br>and who later came to the University of<br>atago he completed his PhD in 2001 with<br>the title of his ceases being Optical<br>manipulation of of abose Einstein<br>condensate after that he went on a<br>postdoctor fellowship at the National<br>Institute of Standards and technology or<br>nist uh in<br>Maryland and he arrived in the USA only<br>a few weeks before<br>9911 and he also lived uh in the<br>neighborhood that was tormented by the<br>Washington<br>sniper as well as that n also had a<br>number of suspected Anthrax letters<br>delivered uh while he was there so not<br>surprisingly Blair got out of Maryland<br>and took up a lectureship at ataro in<br>2004 we he has remained uh ever since so<br>Blair my congratulations on your<br>thoroughly deserved promotion to<br>professor and I invite you to deliver<br>okay good evening and thank you for the<br>very kind uh introduction it's my<br>pleasure tonight to tell you a little<br>bit about things that interest me the<br>title my talk is Ultra Cool quantum<br>physics<br>so what I want to do is take us down to<br>some of the coldest stuff in the<br>universe I'm going to start by exploring<br>the cold and in denan it's very easy to<br>explore the cold and I was hoping that<br>being May in denan would dish up a day<br>today that would impress upon you how<br>cold it can be it was actually a<br>fantastic day Al they just turning<br>recently so what I want to start out by<br>doing is just wandering through down<br>into the cold to see what lies<br>there now<br>temperature is a way of<br>characterizing uh how cold something is<br>temperatur is a very subtle Concept in<br>physics and actually very hard to Define<br>but everyone in the room understands<br>what temperatures incredibly well and<br>for instance I know many people put a<br>lot of effort at the moment into<br>insulating the<br>houses Gathering fuel for the cold<br>winter approaching Etc we all want to<br>exist at this comfortable state of 20° C<br>plus or minus and we all know how<br>terribly cold and horrendous it is to be<br>in these situations where it's a little<br>bit colder like I've SE here the scarfy<br>flat at approximately 0° C could not<br>think of anything worse than that so so<br>this perhaps their first impression is<br>cold is sort of boring and uncomfortable<br>I hope to change your mind about that<br>tonight if I ask you what is the coldest<br>stuff you can think of well if you were<br>to wonder around parts of the University<br>you might see people filling up these<br>containers with liquid nitrogen you may<br>also encounter this stuff if you go to<br>your doctor liquid nitrogen is really<br>really cold stuff it has a temperature<br>of negative<br>196° C that's the temperature at which<br>this uh boils that is really cold it was<br>first liquefied in<br>1883 um but actually I should make one<br>point here in physics we don't like<br>these negatives negative temperature<br>that's not very useful concept and it<br>really shows us the breakdown of the<br>Celsius scale so from this point on I'm<br>going to refer to things in the Kelvin<br>or absolute temperature scale and Kelvin<br>unit of Kelvin is the same size as C<br>except it starts from um absolute zero<br>where everything stops which is -<br>273° so on this new thermometer here<br>I've plotted what room temperature is<br>about 293 de Kelvin um and you can see<br>that we've decreased all the way down to<br>about 77 Kelvin where nitrogen or air<br>becomes a<br>liquid okay so that's pretty cold stuff<br>life actually already gets when we get<br>to this sort of temperature regime there<br>are things we can find in this regime<br>such as<br>superconductors this is the first of the<br>super phenomenon we will meet tonight<br>what is a superconductor it is a<br>material which has zero resistance to<br>electrical current most materials you<br>run electrical current through them they<br>get warm a superconductor has zero<br>resistance that means if you make a loop<br>of wire and you set up a current and it<br>is superc conducting that current will<br>continue without any battery<br>forever that is really a super phenomena<br>well superconductors were first<br>discovered in about 1911 in materials<br>such as mercury at extremely cold<br>temperatures of about 4 Kelvin as time<br>has progressed uh the temperature at<br>which these systems become<br>superconducting that's a phase<br>transition to the superconducting state<br>has gradually increased as as people<br>have found beater materials and in<br>particular on this graph down here um<br>showing the sort of history of these<br>superconductors around the 80s there's a<br>sudden jump up to materials at superc<br>conducting at liquid nitrogen<br>temperatures so these are the so-called<br>high temperature superconductors the<br>Cates so this is some fun you get down<br>on these cold temperatures wonderful<br>phenomena like super<br>conductivity we can go a bit colder<br>helium's a really wonderful element<br>helium becomes a liquid at<br>4 Kelvin and it's a really interesting<br>substance because it is so light that<br>helium does not become a solid it's the<br>only substance we know of that doesn't<br>become a solid as you decrease the<br>temperature to zero it becomes a liquid<br>but that is it so helium is a really<br>interesting uh material and I'll talk<br>about it a few times its boiling point<br>is 4.2 Kelvin that is really cold most<br>people will not encounter this stuff it<br>is very rare and expensive I've shown a<br>picture here gentlemen loading up some<br>helium liquid helium into these units<br>which are part of MRI machines it's used<br>to make the superconducting magnets<br>required to take MRI images so this is<br>really cold stuff 4 Kelvin look how much<br>colder is on my thermometer than liquid<br>nitrogen and that's really cold stuff so<br>we're going right down now to these<br>getting pretty close to zero here let's<br>go a little bit further we can ask<br>ourselves what's the coldest naturally<br>occurring temperature in the universe<br>actually it's only a little a little bit<br>lower than that at 2.7 Kelvin is the<br>average temperature of the universe far<br>away from things such as Stars this is<br>the temperature of the cosmic microwave<br>background that flows through our<br>universe this is a picture of the<br>fluctuations on that background of<br>radiation so this is what we expect to<br>be the lowest naturally occurring<br>temperatures in the universe it is<br>really cold 2.7 Kelvin this is<br>I can go half a Kelvin below that and<br>something interesting happens helium<br>became a liquid at 4 Kelvin I go down to<br>2.2 Kelvin helium under goes a phase<br>transition it becomes a so-called super<br>fluid super fluids are really exciting<br>fluids they do strange things they flow<br>with zero viscosity so like a<br>superconductor current flowing with zero<br>resistance and a super fluid we have the<br>flow of a fluid with zero viscosity that<br>leads to odd things films in helium will<br>climb up out of the container to lower<br>the potential energy that is really odd<br>the scientists first working with this<br>basically needed their heads Red after<br>seeing what this fluid did it has zero<br>viscosity that's no friction it can flow<br>through porous plugs that would normally<br>hold any viscous fluid fluid this is<br>really odd stuff it was discovered in<br>1937 and there's something else really<br>odd about this helium comes into two<br>Isotopes Isotopes basically are the same<br>atom but they differ in that there's one<br>extra or a different number of neutrons<br>in the nucleus now normally we don't<br>care so much about that different<br>numbers of neutrons in the nucleus would<br>affect nuclear reactions you might care<br>about it if you want to build some sort<br>of nasty nuclear weapon but usually at a<br>chemical level there is no difference<br>but here is the mystery helium 4 the<br>isotope of helium that weighs a little<br>bit more becomes the super fluid helium<br>3 does not<br>so normally almost no difference between<br>these but here the sudden<br>difference this occurs this beautiful<br>superfluid transition 2.17<br>Kelvin well if we go a bit colder<br>something will happen to helium<br>3 in fact at<br>1,000th of a Kelvin above absolute zero<br>helium 3 the other isotope finally<br>becomes a superfluid this is really cold<br>it was discovered 40 years later in 1972<br>a really odd phase of matter now I've<br>upgraded my thermometer I've got a<br>golden thermometer this is a logarithmic<br>thermometer I need that to see what's<br>happening I've got way down below a<br>Calin and to resolve what's happening I<br>need to use this now look at those<br>landmarks along the way room temperature<br>down to liquid nitrogen there was hardly<br>anything on this thermometer the biggest<br>jump to date has been from where helium<br>4 becomes a super fluid down to the<br>super cold temperature we helium 3<br>so we're left with some<br>questions what is the origin of these<br>super phenomena super conductivity<br>superfluidity why is there a colossal<br>difference between the behavior of<br>helium 3 and helium 4 these are two deep<br>and very interesting questions we can<br>hope to<br>address so where does the answer<br>reside the answer to this question comes<br>from one of the most successful theories<br>of modern physics the theory of quantum<br>mechanics now quantum mechanics is a<br>wonderful subject it's got a cult<br>following normally we we sort of teach<br>this over three or four years over many<br>papers we rely on our friends in the<br>maths Department to do a live teaching<br>that helps our students get appropriate<br>skills as well quantum mechanics takes a<br>long time to<br>learn all however in order for us to<br>understand what's going on you're going<br>to need to learn it so I'm going to give<br>you quantum mechanics I'm going to<br>compress four years is down to a couple<br>of<br>slides quantum mechanics rule number<br>one basically you could say this is<br>Heisenberg's uncertainty relationship<br>Heisenberg uncertainty relationship<br>States you cannot precisely know both<br>the position and momentum of a particle<br>so we are not allowed to say this<br>particle is here and it is doing this<br>that is illegal that is not consistent<br>with how nature actually is at the<br>microscopic level that's only something<br>that's a good approximation for large<br>object objects so we need a different<br>description that description comes in<br>terms of these things called wave<br>functions that how is how nature is at<br>this microscopic level and so here I<br>have for reference showing um a box in<br>this case a potential and I've drawn<br>some wave functions inside of it<br>interesting thing about this is these<br>wave functions describe the allowable<br>states of a particle in this box and<br>they appear at discrete or quantized<br>energy so this is how quantum mechanics<br>describes what you're allowed to do as a<br>particle really so this is quantum<br>mechanics rule<br>one quantum mechanics rule two we start<br>this in late third year into fourth year<br>so we're halfway through a degree<br>now identical<br>particles are indistinguishable what do<br>we mean by identical particle two<br>electrons two neutrons two protons two<br>hydrogen atoms of the same isotope two<br>identical particles are<br>indistinguishable what I mean by that is<br>they are fundamentally indistinguishable<br>it's not that we're not good enough<br>scientist to measure this difference<br>nature itself cannot tell the difference<br>if you swap them around this is a very<br>curious uh feature of the world we live<br>in furthermore fundamental particles<br>come in two uh flavors two types two<br>categories Fons and bosons of course<br>there's been a lot of attention to o in<br>recent years because of the Hig Bon so<br>let me tell you a little bit about what<br>these two families are for Fons the<br>elementary particles are probably things<br>you've heard of things such as electrons<br>neutrons protons these are the elements<br>we build up atoms out of the elementary<br>particles of bosons are perhaps a little<br>bit less familiar photons these are the<br>particles associated with light and the<br>other Elementary Force<br>particles what's the difference between<br>these two categories well they different<br>rules about how we can use these<br>particles for Fons the So-Cal P<br>Exclusion Principle applies that that<br>there can be at most one fermon per<br>level so you start to put lots of atoms<br>or lots of particles in a system the<br>case of Fons you only have to put one in<br>each of those<br>levels for the case of bons there is no<br>restriction you can have any number of<br>bons in each of those available levels<br>now I should say I've talked about the<br>elementary particles you can build up<br>larger particles atoms for instance out<br>of these and uh these so-call composite<br>particles are also categorized as bosons<br>or fion and the rule is basically the<br>following if you have an odd number of<br>Fons in you an odd number of neutrons<br>plus protons plus electrons in your atom<br>it is still a firon so for instance<br>helium 3 has an odd<br>number on the other hand if you have an<br>even number such as helium four with one<br>extra Pro uh one extra Neutron you are a<br>Boson<br>so let's ask ourselves if we go to<br>extremely low temperatures when you<br>remove all the energy from a system it's<br>going to try and settle down to be in<br>the lowest energy possible configuration<br>it can have for the case of<br>bons here are shown five bosons five<br>blue<br>bons the lowest energy configuration is<br>I put all five in the lowest State<br>that's very nice this is known as a Bose<br>Einstein<br>condensate it's a very simple State it's<br>predicted by and Einstein in<br>1925 on the other hand I've had Fons I'm<br>only allowed by the Exclusion Principle<br>one firon in each state and so my lowest<br>energy ground state is by stacking up<br>these particles and I've shown that on<br>the right there two very different<br>states only differing because one of<br>these so I've used the example of helium<br>3 and helium 4 they only differ by<br>something very small in nucleus but<br>leads to this very large difference in<br>so in some sense we now<br>have a resolution to the difference<br>between these systems so questions<br>relating to why they become super fluid<br>Etc so helium 4 becomes a Bose Einstein<br>condensate at 4.2 Kelvin that's why it<br>becomes a superfluid helium 3 is not<br>allowed to it's<br>fironic but something does happen 2,000<br>times colder those helium three atoms<br>sort of make a little molecule and those<br>molecules are bosonic then they can<br>condense so it's this peering operation<br>between the helium 3 to make them into<br>bons that allows them eventually to<br>become a superfluid this peering up uh<br>procedure is very similar to what<br>happens in a superconductor where<br>electrons peer up and then they condense<br>so actually this idea of condensation of<br>bons underlies the super<br>phenomena so this is why um this Bose<br>Einstein con is very important phenomena<br>at cold<br>temperatures well few confessions that's<br>a little bit overly simplified liquid<br>helium is a dense and strongly<br>interacting<br>system that means that there a few bad<br>things come out of this the interactions<br>deplete the condensate even if you could<br>take helium super fluid helium down to<br>zero temperature the condensate would be<br>less than 8% of the system interactions<br>basically destroy it they promote 92% of<br>the atoms out of the condensate<br>the theory is extremely difficult this<br>is a dense liquid the atoms in the<br>system are basically touching each other<br>it is very dense and difficult to model<br>system and the experiments are hard the<br>Holy Grail has been to obtain a dilute<br>gas condensate this is a system that is<br>so dilute the interactions do not<br>disguise the condensate we can have a<br>condensate of effectively 100% and see<br>Bose and Einstein's original uh<br>prediction however if I have a dilute<br>gas I lower its density it density is a<br>lot lower than a liquid and what happens<br>is the critical temperature at which we<br>get this Bose Einstein condensate is<br>lowered to incredibly low temperatures<br>in fact into the regime of the ultra<br>cold that is less than a millionth and I<br>mean less than a millionth of a degree<br>above absolute zero these are<br>extraordinarily cold<br>temperatures of course I wouldn't have<br>raised it had it not been possible and a<br>few very important developments in the<br>area of atomic M and Optical physics<br>have enabled us to get into these<br>regimes I'll emphasize I'm a theorist so<br>I think about this rather than doing it<br>but I'll take you on the Journey of what<br>competent people uh do in the labs okay<br>so one of the procedures for getting<br>down most of the way is to use this<br>procedure known as laser cooling one<br>takes your gas isolated in some sort of<br>vacuum chamber and there's a nice little<br>picture here of this dot showing a<br>little sample of gas you shine an<br>appropriate lasers from all directions<br>and they can actually reduce the<br>temperature of this gas from something<br>of order room temperature down<br>to of order tens or 100 millionths above<br>absolute zero in the Kelvin scale how is<br>this done well it's a long story and a<br>little bit long to tell here but<br>essentially photons in the lasers carry<br>momentum they can collide with the atoms<br>and they can remove its velocity and if<br>you Collide enough photons with the<br>atoms you can call it down to this<br>regime now this amazing technology was<br>developed in the late '70s ' 80s and<br>'90s result resulted in the Nobel Prize<br>in<br>1997 of course we had Bill Phillips here<br>giving a public lecture at the start of<br>last year about this amazing achievement<br>may also uh recognize Steve Chu who<br>until recently was the Secretary of<br>Energy in the United<br>States okay so that's really cold but<br>it's not cold enough you won't get a<br>condensate with laser cooling you need<br>to go a lot<br>colder one these to use a second<br>technique it's known as evaporative<br>cooling and evaporative cooling well<br>this is actually something everyone in<br>this room knows about when you get a hot<br>bowl of soup and taking a spoon what you<br>do is you blow upon the spoon removing<br>the hot atoms of steam and the soup in<br>the spoon gets colder now with a<br>5-year-old and a four-year-old at home I<br>spend a large fraction of my time<br>evaporative cooling so I've got very<br>good at this<br>um and so in experiments how it's done<br>is well there's some sort of trap<br>holding these atoms this could be<br>Optical this could be magnetic only the<br>hottest atoms run up the side of the<br>Trap and if you can lower the sides<br>somehow let those atoms Escape they will<br>take<br>away an above average amount of energy<br>hence reducing the temperature now<br>normally when evaporatively cool and you<br>blow upon a spoon of soup you probably<br>don't notice that the soup goes down<br>unless you blow so hard it spills over<br>the side but normally you wouldn't<br>actually notice the amount of<br>loss but in the evaporative cooling they<br>perform here they probably throw away<br>99.9% of the atoms that's an amazing way<br>to lower your temperature and so that's<br>how we get<br>from tens or hundreds of millions of<br>Kelvin down to the nanin regime okay so<br>this technique is very useful and this<br>led to the observation of Bose Einstein<br>condensation 70 years after Einstein<br>predicted it this was realized in the<br>lab two labs in the US realized this in<br>1995 the group at Boulder Colorado with<br>rubidium 87 a bosonic isotope and later<br>that year the group at MIT with sodium<br>23 another bosonic isotope um and so<br>these famous pictures uh show something<br>kind of interesting about this phase<br>transition and I I emphasize that these<br>pictures are taken by releasing the<br>atoms from the trap they in there expand<br>out and these pictures really show you<br>the velocity distribution of these<br>systems and they're taken by shining<br>some laser on the atoms and taking a<br>picture of the<br>Shadow I want to emphasize that you take<br>a picture of these atoms you destroy<br>them they are so cold you take a picture<br>they are gone gone in the sense of<br>heated up so moving from left to right<br>in both sets of pictures what we see is<br>the first picture on the left is the<br>velocity distribution before you have a<br>condensate this is an isotropic BAS<br>basically normal gas of atoms you call<br>it a little bit and this big peak<br>develops in the center this is the Bose<br>Einstein conate waving hello here I am<br>this is a macroscopic number of atoms<br>where I mean 10,000 a macroscopic number<br>of atoms all in a single Quantum State<br>this is a phenomenal state of matter and<br>then the rightmost graph is almost a<br>pure 100% all the atoms in a single<br>Quantum mode this is a Quantum fluid<br>this was an amazing achievement that<br>really revolutionized this area of<br>physics and resulted in 2001 Nobel Prize<br>to these four three gentlemen so now I<br>want to convince you okay this stuff's<br>really cold this is in the Nano Calin<br>regime this is a billion times colder<br>than anything else you'll find in the<br>universe that is really cold<br>okay but it's really interesting this<br>stuff can do some weird stuff and let me<br>show you a couple of experiments that<br>were very important for me well I think<br>are very important one was an experiment<br>done soon after the first realization of<br>BC and was to take two condensates<br>separated in space a little bit release<br>them from their traps let them expand<br>and overlap question is what happens to<br>the system and we have these images on<br>the right perhaps concentrate on the<br>experimental ones and they show that in<br>the region where they overlap there was<br>some interference Fring<br>well this should bother<br>you because here I had my two BCS<br>expanding and<br>overlapping so if I think about the<br>density in that region some densities<br>flowed in from one of these condensates<br>some densities Flo in from the other<br>they should just add up but actually<br>what this picture shows us is that<br>instead them just adding up to twice the<br>density we have regions where we added<br>atoms on top of atoms and they canceled<br>out<br>there's nothing<br>there we have other regions we added<br>atoms to atoms and there's twice as much<br>as you expect if this doesn't bother you<br>something is wrong with<br>you if you know quantum mechanics you<br>should be able to predict this but it<br>should still bother you this is a<br>quantum mechanical matter wave this is a<br>phase of<br>matter unlike anything we have intuition<br>for okay this is why it's worth going<br>down to these Ultra cold temperatures<br>here's another very important<br>experiment when I moved to NIS to do my<br>post I joined a very big group of<br>theorists and experimentalists concerned<br>with making Optical lses to do this uh a<br>group in Germany bet the experiments<br>there but um uh this was a very<br>important experiment that was followed<br>on by many other groups around the world<br>so let me tell you about this<br>experiment what one wants to do is make<br>an interesting container to hold your<br>atoms and I think this this shows you<br>the amount flexibility and how much fun<br>we can have in this field this<br>interesting container is to make a<br>lattice a periodic potential another way<br>to say that is I want to make something<br>like an egg carton for holding atoms we<br>can do that by interfering pairs of<br>light Fields laser fields to make<br>standing waves and the atoms see that<br>like a potential so it's very precisely<br>engineered egg carton potential to put<br>your atoms in the reason why the system<br>is kind of<br>interesting is<br>that when your lattice you're holding<br>them in is shallow your intensity of<br>your lasers is quite low what happens is<br>your condensate spreads out through the<br>whole<br>lattice this is kind of interesting<br>firstly the atoms don't have enough<br>energy to get over the barriers so the<br>reason they spread out through the<br>lattice is quantum mechanical tunneling<br>that's a nice and interesting feature<br>but nevertheless each atom is in a wave<br>function that spreads out over this<br>whole system if you suddenly release it<br>from the system and watch what you get<br>you get interference pattern again just<br>like we explained before but here's the<br>Curious Thing This is a dilute system<br>extremely dilute you might think<br>interactions aren't important actually<br>we can engineer them to be as important<br>as we want and as the depth of this lce<br>increases what happens is interactions<br>fight tunneling and the system underes a<br>phase transition to a new phase with<br>precise one atom per site this is no<br>longer a system with all the atoms in<br>the same state that become strongly<br>correlated so by this just controlling<br>the intensity of the lasers or the latus<br>depth you can engineer this transition<br>between two distinct phases of matter<br>and of course luckily if you lower the<br>lattice you'll get back your old<br>interference pattern this is a<br>reversible what's known as a Quantum<br>phase transition this experiment pulled<br>in a huge number of people to our field<br>who previously thought this was just a<br>cute little field part of the reasons is<br>this modern schlat state looks like what<br>you might call an atomic crystal which<br>you might Implement something known as a<br>Quantum simulator I'll mention this<br>later I should acknowledge chrisen<br>Gardner who's in the audience and was<br>responsible for the theoretical<br>prediction of this phase transition four<br>years prior to it being done in this lab<br>in<br>Germany so those are kind of two<br>experiments I hope can show you sort of<br>how exciting how much much control we<br>have in this field how much interesting<br>things you can do um I'd like to say a<br>little bit more about experiments even<br>though I'm not an experimentalist so<br>here's an experiment in theory I stole<br>this picture from a recent graduate from<br>atago from the experimental lab this is<br>a picture of the vacuum chamber where<br>these condensates are made at one end we<br>have uh all these lasers coming in to do<br>laser<br>cooling okay then after its laser cooled<br>the ATS are shot down to the other end<br>and there's a science cell where you do<br>evaporative cooling then you do your<br>science okay so this is a nice picture<br>of a vacuum chamber where this is all<br>performed remember everything's in<br>vacuum nothing can touch the atoms<br>inside this because they'll instantly<br>destroy it everything else is so hot<br>this stuff's so<br>cold here's what the experiment really<br>looks like here's a science cell down<br>this end surrounded by huge<br>coils okay lasers coming in high power<br>huge currents running through these<br>things water cooled on the right hand<br>side we see the laser systems you need<br>very precisely controlled lasers to do<br>your laser cooling to manipulate these<br>atoms to image them Etc this is one<br>complicated experiment whil to zoom out<br>and show you the whole Lab you'd see<br>more and more like this so I'll<br>emphasize you don't go down to the shop<br>and buy this experiment they don't sell<br>them in kits you require a number of<br>people to spend 3 or four years building<br>this these are really complicated<br>experiments and one of the great things<br>about being at a place likeo is we<br>actually have a very strong trai<br>tradition in this area and we have a<br>number of Firsts we're the first place<br>in the southern hemisphere to make a<br>Bose Einstein condensate that was done<br>in 1998 there's a massive achievement<br>really put us on the international radar<br>in that area more recently uh the groups<br>obtained a degenerate firmy gas of<br>potassium the first in the southern<br>hemisphere to do that so um of course if<br>anyone's<br>interested in finding out more about<br>this I encourage you to ask Neil's kard<br>who runs the lab to give you a tour<br>sometime it's really a fascinating<br>experience and it's great to think this<br>coldest stuff in the universe is made<br>away okay I'll tell you a little bit<br>about parameters before going on to a<br>little bit more about what I do these<br>systems are prepared in alide vacuum I<br>showed you that they're held in magnetic<br>and Optical traps you can't use any<br>material trap to hold these things<br>typical numbers of atoms and the<br>condensates could be of order tens of<br>thousands millions maybe 10 Millions for<br>a large condensate so that's really tiny<br>spec the density of these the number<br>density is something like 10 20 atom per<br>cubic meter now that probably doesn't<br>mean much to you that is 100,000 times<br>less dense than the air you are<br>breathing now this stuff is really<br>dilute okay this everything about the<br>system is at the extremes the typical<br>size is up to about 0.1 of a mill so you<br>could potentially see it um if it was<br>somehow illuminated in addition to being<br>really really<br>cold<br>so I you might call me a theoretical<br>physicist I like to think I'm also quite<br>significantly a computational physicist<br>and right from the early days of doing<br>research uh in this area I have always<br>been overwhelmed by the power computers<br>have to do things so remember my first<br>honors project giving a computer with a<br>Pentium Pro processor and it probably<br>few people here remember this and asking<br>my computer to diagonalize some Matrix<br>with a 100 by 100 in size something that<br>you never ever be able to do with hand<br>by hand and just seeing this computer<br>spit up<br>answers one after another all these<br>answers popping up just being amazed and<br>Blown Away by how amazing computers are<br>at doing maths so um a lot of workers in<br>this area making computers do something<br>useful in terms of the science we want<br>to understand however despite how<br>powerful computers are it's a little bit<br>depressing when you come to think about<br>quantum physics in our regime of ultra<br>cold gases the exact theory is known<br>it's not like in the high energy physics<br>where they still want to know what's<br>happening we actually know essentially<br>an exact Theory to describe these<br>systems we're dealing<br>with so that's good but the theory is<br>unsolvable<br>well not in principle it's solvable in<br>practice it isn't I'm going to try and<br>convince you that what I mean by that<br>let me<br>consider a very small condensate a<br>thousand atoms in about a thousand<br>levels okay to<br>describe the state to a full quantum<br>mechanical description of the system<br>would require 10 to the 600 bytes of<br>memory now doesn't sound like a large<br>number 600 doesn't sound like a large<br>number but trust me 10 to the 600 is<br>pretty large it's possibly one of the<br>largest numbers uh one would ever<br>encounter in fact you hopefully won't<br>encounter this number um for comparison<br>the entire world storage all memory all<br>DVDs all Blu-rays in 2011 was estimated<br>to be 3 * 10 20 not even close every<br>single atom in the universe added up is<br>expected to be 10 to the 80 so even if<br>used every atom in the universe as a bit<br>of memory you couldn't store this state<br>quantum mechanics is really hard Theory<br>we know what it is we just can't solve<br>it for the manyi particle<br>system okay in my lesson before I forgot<br>to mention something about superposition<br>so I should say something now where do<br>these numbers come from well when you<br>have interactions you kind of need to<br>mix up all these states a little bit and<br>what happens is for the case of two<br>particles and two levels a complete<br>description would be some number<br>times a state of two atoms in the ground<br>state nothing up there some number times<br>all these possible configurations and<br>there are only three configurations when<br>you've got two atoms two<br>states so if one goes up to five atoms<br>five states it turns out that you do all<br>sorts of Arrangements you get<br>126 10 atoms 10 states 92,000 20 atoms<br>20 States 98 billion this grows really<br>fast these hubit spaces grow massive so<br>for any problem we would actually<br>consider to be serious sufficiently<br>large it would just be absolutely<br>impossible to get a direct solution so<br>this is kind of bad but on the other<br>hand it's great for a theorist because<br>everything we do and even if you could<br>solve this what are you going to do with<br>your 10 to the 600 numbers when you've<br>got your<br>solution so as a theorist this is great<br>because we have to develop ax theories<br>that will work on the systems of<br>interest and the regime of Interest so<br>this is a great challenge to us and um<br>that's what I spend my time doing<br>developing a theory to solve the sorts<br>of problems we'll be interested in and<br>one has a range of theories one can use<br>I'm going to briefly outline one of the<br>theories I've worked on um this is a<br>very New Zealand Theory uh in a way I<br>can't really won't bother explaining but<br>just many of the collaborators involved<br>in developing this over the past 10<br>years have been either based in New<br>zealanders Or ex new zealanders okay so<br>this is where the title of my talk comes<br>from Ultra Cool matter waves if we want<br>to develop a theory for a system that's<br>Ultra cold but not actually zero<br>temperature actually zero temperature<br>turns out to be kind of easy we just<br>warm it up a little bit what happens<br>when you warm it up well you promote<br>some of the atoms out of the ground<br>state and in fact in this Ultra Cool<br>regime below the critical temperature<br>but not zero temperature you'll find<br>there's a reasonably large number of<br>levels in the system where the average<br>occupation is greater than one it turns<br>out for all of those levels we can stop<br>thinking about there being occupational<br>particles in those levels and replace<br>them by matter waves these things that<br>interfere and behave in a sort of<br>interesting way so this is great we take<br>a massive problem in hbit space or it's<br>completely unsolvable and for those<br>levels end up with a nonlinear wave<br>equation in 3D space very easy to say<br>but the sort of ideas underlying this<br>were developed in a huge number of<br>papers over 10 years involving both<br>myself and my collaborators this turns<br>out to be a very useful and flexible<br>Theory I can't go into it into much<br>detail here but of course welcome<br>afterwards uh any want to ask me some<br>more details but I'll show you what it<br>can do um here's a very nice picture<br>generated picture in the middle is uh<br>what we can simulate using these kind of<br>theories looking at the velocity<br>distributions at high temperatures just<br>below condensation and all the way down<br>to zero temperature and this Compares<br>very nicely with What's Done in<br>experiments so these are sorts of things<br>we can calculate the quantum manyi body<br>problem in a very tractable way um just<br>for reference below showing these what<br>the actual pictures look like of these<br>instantaneous matter wave fields we use<br>in our Solutions so what sort of<br>problems can we deal with again I'll<br>just give you a brief little touch upon<br>the sorts of physics we've looked at in<br>the system one particular important<br>thing is what you could call the Quasi<br>two-dimensional Bose<br>gas and this system is kind of<br>interesting for the following reason if<br>I take a three-dimensional Bose Ein<br>Stone condensate and start squeezing it<br>down as one can do by for instance<br>putting it in a one-dimensional optical<br>lattice just slice it up something<br>interesting kind of happens it turns out<br>there's a theorem of many body physics<br>what says that a condensate is not<br>allowed to exist in two Dimensions the<br>fluctuations will kill the condensate<br>well that's kind of depressing but super<br>fluidity remains there is no condensate<br>but there a superfluid so 2D is a really<br>interesting playground for many body<br>physics and this super fluid is kind of<br>unique because lying under the super<br>fluid is the role something known as<br>vortices what is a vorticy well it's<br>like a Whirlpool taken down to the<br>quantum level and at the quantum level<br>there is a fundamental unit of<br>circulation and these vortices can<br>either be positive or negative<br>circulating left or right and in the<br>super fluid these vortices tend to bind<br>up into peers and so this is a novel<br>known as a binski costus stellis bkt<br>superfluid phase this is something we<br>can look at with our Theory and unlike<br>any other available Theory we can look<br>and see what the vores are doing this<br>gives a really unique window of studying<br>this very interesting super fluid regime<br>as another kind of example I've shown<br>here of a non equilibrium sort of<br>Dynamics we can consider with our theory<br>is we can set up the super low<br>equivalent of a persistent current so in<br>our condensate we put a whirlpool in the<br>center show this here's a Quantum<br>Whirlpool through the center of this<br>this current should persist except that<br>it is in a non- rotating system with a<br>thermal cloud and over time this<br>persistent current will wander away from<br>the center of the condensate and<br>die and important questions remain about<br>how long that takes this is a<br>non-equilibrium challenging problem and<br>these are the sorts of things we can<br>study with this Theory and I'll<br>acknowledge Sam Rooney is a very<br>important person for doing work in this<br>area so these are the kind of things we<br>can look at play with post some results<br>and ask a uh experimental cousins to go<br>and have a look and verify this so this<br>is all very fun extremely cold temperat<br>is a very novel<br>fluid you may ask yourself why should we<br>study Ultra cold gases well I'll give<br>you the standard uh why I'm interested<br>in it these are very clean flexible<br>controllable and isolated systems<br>okay many systems where you can look at<br>quantum mechanics you get given what<br>nature gives you some solid lump of<br>material and you just have to analyze it<br>you've got no ability to change it but<br>here is a system which we know<br>essentially everything about and we can<br>study and manipulate it there's this<br>opportunity for direct comparison with<br>Theory you can do the experiment I can<br>do the theory hopefully we agree I but<br>often there's some challenges in there<br>so it's very easy to try and make<br>comparisons between Theory and<br>experiment and there's lots of uh<br>challenges between the two Fields And so<br>there's a sort of dream it up and they<br>will or might try it so we're always<br>trying to come up with novel ideas<br>saying experimentalist go out there and<br>try this so it's a really uh nice field<br>to work in for that reason as far as<br>technology goes one of the reasons are<br>some of the reasons you might be<br>interested in this field is it's leading<br>to improvements in technology such as<br>atomic clocks and so this graph at the<br>top shows the basically the accuracy<br>atomic clocks versus time there's quite<br>a significant jump jump in the middle of<br>the uh uh 1990s when laser cooled clocks<br>came into play the one expects as more<br>and more Technologies developed in this<br>area will get better and better atomic<br>clocks why do we care things such as the<br>global positioning system depend on us<br>having these very precise atomic clocks<br>other areas of precision measurement the<br>fact that you might be able to develop<br>something like an ineter instead of<br>being based on lasers and light this<br>ineter could be based on atoms and allow<br>very high Precision measurement of<br>things such as magnetic fields<br>gravitational fields and the<br>like but there some really exciting<br>reasons which I think we'll uncover more<br>during the<br>century idea of a Quantum simulator so<br>there's a picture here of Richard fan<br>very famous charismatic American<br>physicist and there's a quote of him now<br>Richard fman had this bold Brooklyn<br>accent which I can't hope to uh emulate<br>but he said nature isn't classical damn<br>it and if you want to make a simulation<br>of nature you'd better make it quantum<br>mechanical and by golly it's a wonderful<br>problem because it doesn't look so<br>easy what vman is saying is I st earlier<br>quantum mechanical problems are hard<br>these massive spaces which we can't ever<br>hope to directly solve on a classical or<br>computer you can buy at the<br>shop so Quantum systems are really hard<br>to<br>simulate but what he's suggesting is<br>that if we have had a controllable<br>Quantum system A system that obeys the<br>laws of quantum mechanics maybe we could<br>use that to simulate some system we<br>can't understand so we actually use<br>quantum mechanics to con conquer quantum<br>mechanics this is the idea fan came up<br>with and let me suggest to you there are<br>big opportunities for this and there's a<br>lot of work going on in this direction<br>so uh here is a hard system this hard<br>system this is a unit cell of itum<br>barium copper oxide a coup rate<br>superconductor now I showed this graph<br>earlier showing the critical temperature<br>superconductors versus time and in the '<br>80s we had this huge jump when the cou<br>rates came around the know as high<br>temperature superconductors high<br>temperature because it's only 150° C<br>okay<br>so problem is we don't understand how<br>they work the theory for these systems<br>is too difficult there's lots of<br>competing theories but basically the<br>jury's out we don't understand how these<br>work we cannot simulate them they're too<br>complicated<br>so that's a really hard system maybe we<br>can take one of these controllable<br>systems our atoms in a lattice do things<br>to these systems to understand this very<br>hard problem if we could work out what<br>ingredients of that system make at a<br>high temperature superconductor maybe we<br>can make an even higher temperature one<br>one that room operates at room<br>temperature these are huge uh huge goals<br>for the field in the long run there are<br>other such problems very difficult<br>quantum mechanical problems designed of<br>new drugs things such as understanding<br>photov vots better ways to produce and<br>understand these often these problems<br>reduce down to very hard quantum<br>mechanical problems so if we could have<br>to ourselves a controllable Quantum<br>system or maybe you want to call it a<br>quantum computer I think it's a very<br>exciting<br>future this field keeps expanding and<br>developing new things that keep people<br>excited and one of the things is there's<br>always new ingredients coming<br>along I could talk for hours and hours<br>but I won't about some of these I put<br>two in boxes because there systems I<br>work on the fact that new ingredients we<br>turned up through new atoms or species<br>people looking at long range<br>interactions in the system dipole dipole<br>interactions liberating the spin degrees<br>of freedom of these systems to study<br>some combination of magnetism and these<br>superfluid systems so that's exciting<br>new s of knobs to twiddle on these<br>systems the ability to make synthetic<br>magnetic fields these are neut atoms<br>we're dealing with but you can make them<br>think they're seeing a magnetic field<br>and think they're<br>charged okay you can confuse these atoms<br>you can associate atoms into molecules<br>and and make molecular gases so this is<br>chemistry done not driven by entropy but<br>driven by control from external Fields<br>so this is all on these are all being<br>done in the lab and allow this uh system<br>to have lots of<br>flexibility Okay so<br>that point I'm in the end part of what<br>I'm talk about but not finished saying<br>some things so I'm end game and I want<br>to make statement about teaching and a<br>few acknowledgements along the way one<br>thing I'd like to say is about 8 years<br>ago our department repealed don't ask<br>don't tell we provided these devices to<br>our students in first year and for me<br>this was really a revolution in<br>teaching prior to that I was in the<br>situation of like I am tonight<br>information flowing out not being able<br>to to tell from the faces if I was<br>boring people they didn't understand or<br>whatever and what this technology did<br>was allowed one in the lecture to keep<br>have this real time input from the<br>students what do they know what do we<br>need to spend more time on but actually<br>the Revolution was when the students got<br>to see that they weren't the only one<br>who thought that way the discussion that<br>opened up in class was really eye<br>opening to me and so um I'll<br>congratulate her department for going<br>down this path and it did was really<br>bold move and as I say it really<br>affected the way I've done teaching uh<br>ever since so I just wanted to mention<br>that because I spent a lot of time<br>teaching and this was something<br>important um I've made a list here and I<br>I really hope I haven't left left anyone<br>off of the most important people in<br>everything I do there's the members of<br>my group uh I've listed listed from MSC<br>level and above honest students you<br>stick around and you'll you'll make it<br>next time um I have had the fortune<br>working with a lot of really great<br>talent and uh both postdoctoral and<br>student level um I would say we're very<br>fortunate here in New Zealand we have a<br>good education system I never seem to<br>have a shortage of very talented<br>students coming<br>through um in fact I have colleagues<br>from very famous institutions overseas<br>who are very jealous of the quality of<br>the students I get coming through um so<br>so I would just like to acknowledge<br>these people but I think working my area<br>is very difficult you've got to be you<br>work on a project basically by yourself<br>you have to understand all the<br>literature in that area develop theories<br>develop codes and I mean write your own<br>numerical codes to solve problems this<br>is a very demanding area and I have<br>benefited greatly from these very<br>talented people many of whom I would<br>rate as being far more capable than<br>myself I'd like to thank my department I<br>put uh photos of my 32ds of surer I'd<br>like to thank of course jury Carrington<br>man of great wisdom who appointed me in<br>the first<br>place um Rob Bell and Pat Langhorn now<br>I'd like to say I think the physics<br>department is a very Progressive<br>Department right from when I arrived 10<br>years ago there were workload models in<br>place everything was very transparent in<br>our department the department worked<br>very hard to protect new staff members<br>from too much work early on so we could<br>get our research careers going I think<br>it's a very Progressive and supportive<br>Department of everyone in it and so I<br>would like to publicly acknowledge the<br>great leadership we have had and I hope<br>the university realizes what a great uh<br>uh unit they've had<br>there I've decided not to list members<br>of academic and general staff in their<br>Department you're all wonderful but I'm<br>just scared I'll forget someone there's<br>lots of great people very collegial<br>department and it's been a pleasure to<br>work in this department uh over<br>time I'd like to say something about<br>Quantum research in New Zealand I've put<br>some photos of important people in the<br>background you can see Rutherford<br>Rutherford is undoubtedly the greatest<br>scientist New Zealand ever produced okay<br>he got the Nobel Prize for chemistry but<br>things are a bit different back then but<br>I put him in the background for the<br>following reason rord went away to do<br>his work he did his work<br>overseas these four people in front of<br>you established quantum physics in New<br>Zealand they did the work in New Zealand<br>and they put us on the international<br>stage I think New Zealand has punched<br>above its weight in quantum physics for<br>a long time maybe it's not widely known<br>often these things are not widely known<br>outside of the circles um and so I would<br>like to uh uh pay respect to all these<br>people um in particular Rob B who has<br>worked tirelessly to build up quantum<br>physics at a tago we have eight<br>permanent faculty roughly in this area<br>and that is a really hard thing this is<br>a very competitive area internationally<br>it's hard to get good people and so Rob<br>has tiously worked to develop a<br>department and get us critical mass and<br>an international profile so thank you<br>very much for all that hard work Rob I<br>know at times you feel like pulling you<br>here out but you've made something<br>wonderful um I've also crossed my<br>fingers at the bottom uh in conjunction<br>with our colleagues in Oakland we have a<br>current Center of Excellence bidden<br>David Hutchinson has put a huge amount<br>of work putting together a fantastic<br>application Maybe will have good news in<br>the next couple of weeks David fingers<br>crossed thank you for all your hard<br>work<br>um university and funders I benefited<br>immensely from support from the Marsen<br>fund it enables one to follow this sort<br>of fundamental research that we get to<br>follow here and so I would like to thank<br>them my university is a wonderful place<br>to work it has supported me in many ways<br>uh postgraduate scholarships are just a<br>wonderful thing and a great that they're<br>so available here uh also through yog<br>funding Etc I would also like to<br>acknowledge something I think is very<br>unique about atago a vice Chancellor a<br>deputy Vice chancellors a pro Vice<br>chancellors are all highly successful<br>academics they lead us<br>by a do as I do not a do as I say<br>approach and I think that um the sense I<br>get around me is that we always respect<br>our leaders a lot because of that um I<br>think ataro has resisted all sorts of<br>corporate trends that have gone over<br>other institutions and held up high<br>academic values and so I thank our<br>leaders for protecting us and keeping<br>this a wonderful environment to work<br>in finally I have a life outside of work<br>um luckily these two<br>Lads I'm not sure I saw the other one<br>but any one of them one of them I can<br>see and he's survived the whole lecture<br>I think it's at times hard to be a<br>family of an<br>academic um One never really stops<br>working almost never do I go anywhere<br>without my laptop I'm traveling a lot my<br>hours are very<br>regular um and so life is often very<br>hard I travel a lot furthermore it's<br>hard even harder being uh part of a<br>physics family um we bring physicists<br>home and that's that's<br>always so sorry about that so um so in<br>particular I'd thank be she followed me<br>to United States it with my postl and<br>then came back here so um I've always<br>sort of been uh um developing my career<br>and be's taken a a support role when<br>needed and of course through all the<br>stressful things related with our<br>raising a family so thank you very much<br>be I appreciate your support I couldn't<br>have done it without you and I think at<br>that point I'll say thank you everyone<br>BL thank you very much I'm Pat Langhorn<br>you might have seen my photograph of<br>much younger<br>photograph um up on Blair's slides there<br>I'm currently the head of<br>Department uh in physics and it's my<br>privilege to be around all these very<br>smart<br>people<br>um I don't know some of you will have<br>been in Blair's office I know some of<br>you have but if you go into Blair's<br>office up on the wall there's a great<br>big TV screen and you might be tempted<br>to think lovely I'll just sit down in<br>one of these comfy armchairs and I'll<br>watch an episode of coordination Street<br>or down to ABI or<br>something but if you look at that what<br>you'll see is a whole lot of formula<br>very big long formula that Blair and his<br>students Converse in and so I think<br>we've been very privileged today to have<br>been taken Beyond these formula and had<br>that world that the formula tell you<br>about brought um very<br>vividly to our site so very vividly to<br>what we can see and of course we see<br>that it's a a very strange world this<br>very cold world where everything's going<br>very slowly you know you might be<br>tempted to say go on bler you're pulling<br>our legs it can't really be like<br>that<br>um but I think we've got to REM remember<br>that it is reality I mean it's as real<br>as pencils it's as real as a tax return<br>it's as real as anything else around us<br>in this room just<br>now so I'd like to thank Blair very much<br>for bringing this all to our<br>view I'd also like to just add to what<br>uh the vice Chancellor and pro Vice<br>Chancellor said about BL in the<br>introduction what they didn't see is<br>that he's actually a damn nice person as<br>well as all the other great things that<br>you can say about<br>him and so we are delighted that he's<br>now Professor Blair and we would like to<br>appreciation<br>and finally we'd like to invite you all<br>to join us for drinks and nibbles over<br>at the staff Club so if you follow the<br>trail of people it should take you uh<br>upstairs in the staff Club so thank you<br>Blair once again we are very delighted<br>with your um rise to this elevated<br>position and it is very welld deserved</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
