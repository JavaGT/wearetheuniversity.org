She has developed the original version of the footprint tracking tunnels that are now routinely used to monitor stoat and rat densities on protected lands. Throughout the decades Dr King has produced well documented research on stoats in New Zealand, leading to many successful publications.<br><br>Find out more about Dr King's at http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/about-us/people/cmking</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;
