Dr Collier's current research is centered on the ecology of large rivers, and has included initiating a national survey of large rivers to investigate macroinvertebrate and functional indicators for assessing river health. <br><br>Find out more about Dr Collier at http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/about-us/people/kcollier.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>over recent years my research has<br>focused on the ecology of large rivers<br>these are iconic water bodies that most<br>of us identify with but we don't know<br>much about what listed what lives in<br>there or what sort of processes affect<br>their life<br>and historically they've been very<br>difficult to sample but now we've got a<br>lot better technology that we can use to<br>explore those deep and fast flowing<br>environments<br>and this information is important<br>because<br>future management of the waikato river<br>for example which is our largest longest<br>river<br>is going to be underpinned by the<br>knowledge that we have of what lives in<br>there and what affects them<br>the initial work we've been doing we've<br>had a national survey of large rivers<br>which has shown that<br>the invertebrate communities in those<br>large rivers changes in relation to<br>human pressure which gives us a tool for<br>monitoring large river management and<br>restoration success<br>in relation to the waikato river it's<br>shown as that river edge communities are<br>very different to mid-river communities<br>so the types of vertebrates living in<br>those habitats are different and we need<br>to sample both sorts of habitats to get<br>a full picture of what is living in the<br>river<br>and we've also found the lower river is<br>very much alive we found<br>significant significantly more<br>invertebrate species in the lower river<br>compared to the upper river<br>one of the things we need with large<br>river monitoring is tools to assess the<br>health and ecological condition of<br>waterways and invertebrates tend to<br>respond to those<br>habitat changes and water quality<br>changes quite readily<br>so by learning more about what lives<br>where in the river<br>we can develop tools for developing<br>indicators and monitoring management and<br>restoration success we saw a need to<br>sort of draw the information that<br>already existed on the waikiki river<br>together so i was involved in editing a<br>book on the waikato river<br>which involved contributions from 48<br>authors from 16 organisations<br>and by pulling that together we've<br>hopefully sort of established<br>what the river is like today and we can<br>use that to measure future success of<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
