He comes from a family "loaded with scientists" but it was an enthusiastic teacher that directed him towards physics. And now, with similar enthusiasm, Dr Wilson is taking physics to the people.<br><br>Find out more about Dr Marcus Wilson at http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/about-us/people/mtwilson.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i've been a<br>physicist<br>a scientist for<br>several years now<br>and<br>as i've<br>got that bit older i've realized just<br>how important it is for the<br>general public that's everyone to really<br>appreciate<br>what science is what it's about<br>one of the<br>problems that that i see is that so many<br>people think science is about<br>men in white coats about boffins<br>in a locked away in a lab somewhere<br>modern society<br>and that's just not true but we we need<br>to<br>let the<br>let the public know just what it is that<br>we scientists actually do and that it is<br>important for their everyday lives<br>so<br>i've been<br>doing<br>several things several methods of trying<br>to engage the public in in science and<br>particularly for my case in physics<br>because i'm a physicist<br>so one of them is cafe scientific the<br>idea of cafe scientific is that we take<br>a practicing scientist<br>and put him or her<br>in a cafe a cafe being a<br>an environment that's friendly<br>to the general public not a lecture<br>theatre and we get a discussion going<br>about a particular area of science so<br>that is as much about the audience<br>participating as it is about the<br>scientists participating<br>and gives everyone the chance to really<br>communicate with a scientist<br>and appreciate that area of work<br>and<br>we've been running those in hamilton for<br>five or six years<br>and they've been very successful<br>another thing that i do is keep a<br>physics blog<br>and<br>that's really just drawing out everyday<br>events that happen but<br>where they involve a little bit of<br>physics just explaining<br>what that physics is<br>also i like<br>being in schools and really encouraging<br>school children to their best potential<br>in science and particularly physics so<br>one of the things i do is look at those<br>students who are<br>looking for scholarship physics<br>sitting in said qa scholarship it's a<br>hard exam they need some particular work<br>behind them<br>and they do need some some help<br>generally<br>and i'm quite prepared to give that<br>because children<br>are future scientists and we need to<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
