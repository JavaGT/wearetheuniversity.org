your<br>down uh this was just a collection of<br>students that came together to talk<br>about sustain ideological tax on<br>education in this country and uh things<br>sort of progress to the along the lines<br>there was a a little bit of um<br>intimidation from the security guards so<br>we decided we wanted a peaceful place to<br>talk through some of these ideas and uh<br>as the aggression from the status quo<br>grew we we uh barricaded the doors and<br>and continued the conversation you must<br>have been aware there was going to be a<br>confrontation though because we I mean<br>that was never an intention the idea was<br>to to have a conversation about the the<br>particular things that are going on<br>within the university and within<br>education in New Zealand and we have a<br>right to be here yeah and we have a<br>right to be here we this is our<br>University this is our University and<br>and you know a lot of us pay a lot of<br>money to be here it's supposedly an open<br>space for open ideas where we able to<br>share our creative ideas about what the<br>university should be the Democratic<br>process with within this this University<br>and other universities in this country<br>under sustained attack we take that up<br>you well this was this this was part of<br>a nationwide day of action so there were<br>a few things<br>um one there's there's an ongoing<br>struggle within this particular<br>University with the the teachers<br>education Union um Stuart McCutchen is<br>trying to remove some of the um more<br>democratic process that go into uh the<br>sort of job construction essentially<br>he's trying to um change the the<br>conditions that they already have um so<br>moving things out of contract and into<br>policy so that he has some sort of<br>dictatorial control um you know it's<br>it's it's part of a long process of<br>watering down the the quality of<br>Education in this country and and we<br>think it's about time that someone some<br>people stops to talk about that so this<br>was a place to come together and talk<br>about that yeah yeah I heard talk about<br>student rights are on the tech yeah how<br>committed are you to to occupying the<br>university well we we're going to see<br>and we we'll see if uh if the students<br>come back together I you know we already<br>know that news of what we've done here<br>tonight has circulated to other parts of<br>the country and other students around<br>the world are talking about it well this<br>is something that's happening all over<br>the world students are are coming<br>together and taking back Democratic<br>power that they have that's<br>much what do we want student rights when<br>do we want it what do we want student<br>right when do we want it you're under<br>attack stand up fight back student<br>rights are under attack stand up F back<br>student rights are under attack stand up<br>fight back stand up fight back stand up<br>up<br>you want to give a statement what<br>happened here tonight um well what<br>happened was um I've got your wallet<br>thank you um what happened was we um<br>we're trying to tell the VC we have a<br>conversation with the VC didn't take it<br>too well um the university is ours and<br>we are claiming it and um just thought<br>you should<br>know you want to give a statement uh<br>we're out here in front of the centr<br>city police station uh about an hour ago<br>we just left the University where we had<br>occupied the library basement demanding<br>um of course free education a universal<br>student allowance um greater student<br>union rights um and also um for the<br>government to completely scrap the<br>unionship the police arrested um as far<br>as aware uh one girl harer outside and<br>two other dudes outside um the library<br>based who are supporting us they also<br>then when we were all coming out at the<br>very end they picked off some random guy<br>and they arrested him and now they think<br>that's all right they have no reason to<br>we were democratically<br>protesting so we out<br>here demanding freedom for the rest of<br>the people who are R now holler one of<br>the<br>risk has already been released but still<br>the others have to be released and<br>that's why we're out here demanding<br>immedi get arrested for something you<br>know and I agree with get busted for<br>thought for you will be arrested for<br>your<br>thoughts we're prosecuted because we're<br>different you know because we weren't<br>bow to the status quo and because you<br>know we [ __ ] shouldn't have to we<br>live in a country with a democracy and<br>we can't even stay in a building past<br>9:00 p. because they tell us we can't we<br>pay our fees we go to these universities<br>to learn and if we want to learn we need<br>to stay there until we finished [ __ ]<br>learning not when they say so and not<br>when they lock the door on<br>us<br>okay now the police have warned us that<br>this loud Halo is too bloody loud<br>because we're trying to address our Us<br>in this corrupt system on how corrupt<br>this whole system is and how much we<br>have come here to show our support for<br>our brother who got locked up for<br>absolutely nothing for fighting for his<br>rights as students for fighting for us<br>rights as a human<br>being so the police have given us 10<br>minutes to shut this loud ha out because<br>these rich Fells in these hotels<br>are probably mining because us freedom<br>here let us all be<br>free the<br>police the police said that um they're<br>going to release him because he didn't<br>wrong on the on the conditions that we<br>walk away and they'll let them go walk<br>away when they let them go when they<br>the<br>nowy we just hang out here for another<br>hour then back to the university<br>he just explained that um if we leave<br>he'll he'll get released both of them um<br>if we stick around uh they won't release<br>them and and and and the police uh he<br>said that they'll be happy to stand here<br>because they're getting<br>paid um and they're taking our taxpayers<br>money to stand here um to to protect<br>system
