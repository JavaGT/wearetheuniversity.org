more<br>money even if they don't need it<br>99% 99% 99% 99<br>we<br>are are<br>9% we<br>M hey<br>hey the one person has got to go hey<br>hey be misled by your leaders yeah we've<br>got a common<br>interest down<br>yes have a shower so if anybody wants to<br>come to the toilet I'll show you the<br>trickle down<br>Theory I say hi hi how's it going so far<br>very well very well we've just had a<br>victory the 99% have just won in a game<br>of rugby against<br>1% interestingly afterwards uh police<br>officer was saying to me that he thought<br>it was a little bit rigged he was<br>surprised that 99% could winning the<br>game and I think that's exactly the<br>point of what we're doing here saying<br>yeah wouldn't it be a surprise if the<br>99% won % you are useless CS in our<br>machine are the<br>real we cre the and we are entitled to<br>we here to play games of rugby we're<br>here to have fun but also there's a<br>really important message behind the<br>movement and that is that in a society<br>like ours um increasingly and in<br>particular over the last 30 years a very<br>small group of people have uh taken<br>control over decision- making processes<br>uh through the mechanism of Finance uh<br>they've been able to effectively control<br>and make decisions about all of our<br>lives protesting against that that's<br>really what we're objecting to here<br>that's why we're here because of the<br>power of Finance because of the power of<br>Finance Capital legislation that's<br>retrospectively<br>rpec yes yes the economy is incredibly<br>wealthy<br>referee the money one issue there's not<br>one voice what is very clear is the<br>number of people are extremely angry uh<br>extremely upset about the injustices<br>they see around them um and uh for many<br>years for for 20 or 30 years we haven't<br>really had a voice in which we can<br>express that or if we have been able to<br>express it we've been told that um the<br>economic system is unchallengeable now<br>what the events of the last few years<br>have shown shown us very very clearly is<br>the economic system is arbitrary it's uh<br>injust and uh that there are ways in<br>which we can change it econom is<br>incredibly healthy because we're<br>incredibly wealthy cheers darling cheers<br>darling Cheers<br>Cheers we we can talk about I think it<br>was our actual line do you you<br>understand the problem with corrupted<br>officials is that they may stay<br>corrupted even after you pay<br>them yes that's a line up for 99 he want<br>crooked conviction um and strength for<br>believing and that we're willing to<br>fight for it um and then you know we<br>break down those barriers of fear that<br>people have that you know we can't come<br>out and we can't stand for things we<br>believe in you know on once those<br>barriers disappear you know once someone<br>starts it and shows that they can stand<br>up then other people will will rally<br>buses that's<br>awesome<br>I have control of<br>the who's got the money we' got the<br>money what kind of money I have hi hi<br>hey man how's it going great not too bad<br>and chatting with lots of people it's<br>really awesome we're all equals it's<br>great beautiful I really love how um<br>we're all passionate we're all actively<br>empowering others to create change in<br>this world and that's something we<br>really need at the moment um just know<br>that there's lots of people here that<br>care and we're intelligent beings and<br>that we're trying to do something in<br>your<br>boot oh well the media is not really<br>being too part on us I mean we own them<br>so but generally in the long run they<br>just support status quo which is<br>Rich no problems at all down here uh<br>police been keeping the peace and<br>hopefully tonight tomorrow night they'll<br>be doing the same again if there is some<br>conf between two people come to us we<br>can talk about it um they pretty much<br>covers today sweet um cuz yesterday we<br>had a lot of buying from the general<br>assembly that there were things to<br>change but overall people seem to be<br>happy with this process but we are<br>always open to more suggestion obviously<br>people put their hand up at a particular<br>moment to do things you know um you know<br>like I'm speaking here I'm not speaking<br>on behalf of the group I'm I'm<br>representing my view but uh yeah there's<br>there's no specific leaders<br>we're why do we have to do that now<br>what's the urgency the urgency is that<br>they need to be done by tonight tomorrow<br>morning they have to come down<br>that so at this point the general<br>assembly needs to come up with Solutions<br>on how to deal with this do this in<br>small groups and then have a<br>spokesperson from each group come up<br>with a solution that presents Bri<br>mate we could be handing out propaganda<br>about we can put more banners on them we<br>could have people manning them we could<br>solutions<br>for so we're going to check f consensus<br>The Proposal is to keep the fences up<br>but keep ensure that they are friendly<br>welcoming and and in that sense one of<br>the things that's interesting about this<br>movement is the way that uh people are<br>experimenting with new ways of making<br>decisions uh new consensus based<br>decision-making models um and that's<br>really interesting for people to learn<br>that learn how to make decisions<br>together in which we don't assume that<br>one person's wrong and the other<br>person's right um so the kind of<br>assumption is that by talking together<br>we can learn to come to um we can learn<br>to come to uh ideas that are better than<br>what either of the two parties to the uh<br>dispute uh think in the first place<br>that's interesting as<br>well oh guys this is the sweetest sweet<br>grass we love New<br>Zealand that's why we want to keep<br>$89<br>um all good with that<br>music um from the Occupy uh campus<br>Oakland Al um I'm the head chef of this<br>establishment and um yeah uh we got top<br>marks for our um kitchen Council came in<br>and yeah certified it A+ so yeah that's<br>great for me and my team I guess and<br>everyone else out there um yeah it looks<br>like um people started to actually see<br>the view of why we're here and um<br>collaborating and getting together as a<br>Unity as a unit I guess and uh yeah<br>awesome big up it's in such a good<br>environment too you know like this is<br>relax positive vibe it's nice it's good<br>to see what about the arena oil ship<br>what do you think about that man we're<br>from to sou and it's just hening man<br>like I was down when the when the ship<br>first you just couldn't believe how the<br>inaction Sor just just it's just mind<br>back like just there seem to be too many<br>like people to talk to too many papers<br>going this way and that way there's no<br>real action getting involved and
