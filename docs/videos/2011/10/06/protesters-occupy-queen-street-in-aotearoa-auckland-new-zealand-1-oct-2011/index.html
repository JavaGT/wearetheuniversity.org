occupy Queen Street in Aotearoa Auckland New Zealand 1 Oct 2011</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we are here to show the railroad on new<br>zealand<br>that there are many issues affecting us<br>in this little<br>this little country of ours and then we<br>want to show you the rural new zealand<br>the royal altar or new zealand cure<br>everybody there's a tribe of people in<br>this nation who are living in abject<br>poverty<br>we have half a million people on<br>benefits<br>are out of work we also have another<br>half a million people<br>workers who earn less than 15 an hour<br>and many of those people are working on<br>this street of wealth<br>in every starbucks in every mcdonald's<br>in every kfc in this city people who<br>want to work hard<br>but he can't pay high prices he can't<br>afford gst increases<br>that junkie lied about people who are<br>trying to feed their children<br>300 000 children in this country<br>living in poverty and this is a crime<br>this is a crime because the 150 richest<br>people<br>in this country last year between them<br>got an extra an extra<br>seven billion dollars if we took that<br>money off them<br>and one day we will we could<br>give every worker in new zealand a job<br>at 30 hours a week on 35<br>an hour that's what we have to start<br>demanding in our country<br>and finally as we walk up this street of<br>wealth<br>and the street of poverty and you look<br>at the banks<br>and you look at the fast food outlets<br>that exploit our people<br>think about one thing all over the<br>united states of america today<br>in every city from chicago to los<br>angeles to miami<br>small groups of people like us are<br>occupying<br>the cbd and occupying the financial<br>districts<br>we need to bring this war to john king<br>in the middle of this swampy world cup<br>we should occupy queen street<br>in solidarity with this people's<br>what are occ gonna do we do solemnly<br>declare<br>that the salivating and celebrating jaws<br>of the commonwealth<br>have been the causal link connecting<br>iron fisted crown clauses<br>to our lands waterways and resources<br>ripped and torn asunder we the native<br>down under<br>now confined to the spaces hammered<br>between the lines or worse<br>to save from the sun as living in<br>australia must inevitably<br>one day become okay<br>everybody well we've got the<br>we've got a lot of organizations out<br>here raising a lot of really important<br>issues today<br>and this is the best place to be in new<br>zealand today<br>so let's have a big cheer for everybody<br>well done people you all made a really<br>good decision today to come here<br>because you're representing the many<br>people in new zealand who are having<br>not just a hard go not just a hard time<br>but are suffering acutely in a land of<br>plenty<br>so yeah this is the real new zealand<br>represented here on this march<br>we're representing the people who are<br>living in poverty<br>in new zealand we've got 200 000<br>children plus<br>living in poverty and what is the<br>wealthiest country<br>certainly in this part of the world<br>we've got<br>many people living on benefits as has<br>been said before<br>and this country is in crisis it's in<br>crisis because for a past generation<br>we have allowed a tiny number of people<br>to gain extreme<br>wealth at the expense of the majority<br>and as joe said<br>last year just 150 people<br>in new zealand just 150 had an<br>increase in wealth of 7 billion<br>dollars and some of those people<br>actually think they deserve it<br>they actually think they earned it but<br>we've got these parasitic bludgers at<br>the top<br>and the majority of people struggling<br>well we are going to change that we are<br>going to change that<br>and one of the ways that i'm personally<br>involved in helping to change that is<br>looking at what's happening in<br>parliament<br>you know a generation ago<br>parliamentarians were paid<br>about the same wage as or the same<br>income<br>as a deputy principal of a<br>of a primary school now at the moment<br>a deputy principal of a primary school<br>now earns about seventy thousand<br>what does a back bench mpu 120 130<br>000 so mps have leveraged themselves<br>into the top two percent of income<br>earners in the country<br>and so they're not interested in putting<br>taxes on people<br>on high incomes even labor is talking<br>about putting taxes on people<br>who are earning over 150 000 so that all<br>the mps in his party<br>won't have to pay any extra tax and if<br>you look at mps also<br>you find 70 of mps own more than one<br>property<br>mps are not interested in capital gains<br>taxes that are going to take away their<br>wealth<br>so we've got mps pushing themselves up<br>into that tiny group at the top that are<br>incredibly wealthy<br>so what we've got to do i'm standing for<br>mana this year and i think mana is going<br>kill all you mana supporters out there<br>okay so it's really good to see you all<br>here<br>it's good to see you taking part in the<br>sequoia as i said this is the most<br>important thing that's happening in new<br>zealand today<br>forget about the bloody rugby matches<br>because what<br>we're talking about are policies that<br>don't<br>that don't look at people just for the<br>extent of a rugby match but look at the<br>whole lives of people<br>and the whole lives of people in new<br>zealand are being crushed and destroyed<br>by this extreme<br>separation between rich and poor because<br>of policies which are being followed by<br>this government<br>so good on you for being here give<br>and this have a few chance to really<br>rock the street okay<br>when people's rights are under attack<br>stand up<br>fight back when people's rights are<br>under attack<br>but women's rights are under attack<br>people's rights are under attack<br>thank you very much the issue i'm going<br>to raise is child poverty<br>in our country we have a beautiful land<br>full of food and resources<br>but about 20 of our children are living<br>in poverty<br>child poverty action has been<br>campaigning for years and so<br>many other organizations the wealth of<br>this country needs to be shared so our<br>children<br>can live with a decent standard of<br>living<br>housing health so they can access<br>the resources in schools so they have a<br>chance in life<br>right to then they're taking away our<br>strength this street<br>named queen street does not belong to<br>the queen<br>but it's really not the colonization<br>that has never<br>ended in this country it started out<br>with the colonization of european coming<br>over<br>now it's just economic colonization and<br>the colonization of maori people and<br>indigenous people everywhere<br>will not end as long as we live under<br>the system of capitalism<br>that put profit over people this is<br>not the queen street this is not john k<br>we work with people who are so<br>impoverished that they don't even know<br>that a lettuce grows in the garden they<br>think it comes out of the new world<br>supermarket or pack and<br>save so when we talk about our people<br>being in poverty we are in poverty<br>we are starving in terms of food we are<br>starving in terms of knowledge<br>everything that used to be ours has been<br>taken from us<br>i just want to mention the significance<br>of this location for this rugby world<br>cup<br>our council has paid private security<br>companies<br>that they have been put into their<br>paying<br>private security companies to clear them<br>off the streets<br>these people live here they have nowhere<br>else to go<br>so now they're being prosecuted by<br>having nothing on monday we have to<br>fight the business school<br>because we know<br>the university is the place that is<br>financializing the world<br>it's where poverty is born and it's<br>we believe that the student body needs<br>to be politicized<br>that the student movement needs to be<br>joined with the workers movement<br>with the indigenous movement and with<br>all social justice movements in this<br>country<br>i'm here today to burn the food bill<br>the proposed food bill when i was<br>growing up and that was way up in the<br>hook yanga<br>my mother we had a big garden we're out<br>there every day<br>i actually used to be quite pissed off<br>because i thought it was very hard work<br>and i didn't understand really what she<br>was doing<br>but when it came time to harvest we fed<br>all our queer our ko matua we fed our<br>hospital<br>we fed everybody that came to our house<br>and they all enjoyed<br>the produce that we that came out of our<br>garden<br>if this food bill goes through they<br>intend to stop that they tell you<br>they tell you that they're not going to<br>do that that<br>that won't stop us from sharing our kai<br>from sharing our seeds<br>but a natural fact it is a start to that<br>process<br>so we must be proactive and we must be<br>needs to rights strongly opposed to this<br>build<br>we all know where the real cameras need<br>to go<br>which is in our corporate board rooms<br>that's where the cameras need to go<br>retrospective legislation<br>is not a good look for any country<br>one minute what the police are doing is<br>illegal<br>the search and surveillance bill is not<br>good<br>for any new zealanders we're on our way<br>to a police state to fascism<br>that we do not want all new zealanders<br>need to stand strong against this bill<br>and don't give in to the scare mongering<br>that is telling you that we need this<br>bill<br>for 40 or 50 plus criminal cases<br>that are currently in the line there are<br>already criminal acts of law that can<br>help<br>that process as per normal<br>don't listen to the scaremongering which<br>says<br>your livelihood depends on having these<br>cameras<br>to be unreasonable looking at what<br>reasonably looking at what you are doing<br>let's<br>burn it see these tall banks that asb up<br>there<br>a tsb there that national down there<br>that chase manhattan down the bottom of<br>the road<br>in america they can have 10 reserves<br>they have to have 10 of what they loan<br>you that means if they make a loan to<br>you eight percent<br>they're really making eighty percent in<br>new zealand<br>they need a zero percent lending ratio<br>zero<br>they have to have nothing behind them to<br>load hundreds of billions of dollars out<br>if you owe more money than you have how<br>do you ever pay them back if i owe six<br>dollars on this five dollars<br>how the hell can i pay them back it's<br>not about people have a job<br>it's about mathematical and that's why<br>the whole world is in debt<br>that's why the whole world has more debt<br>than more<br>currency than more liquidity than<br>liquidity<br>how can you have the whole world out of<br>balance a shop over there has to balance<br>the perks of the balance<br>how can we have more debt than credit in<br>a whole<br>planet we could have 40 planets<br>working fully employed and we still<br>would not pay back the debt<br>we have to change the system we have to<br>have nations that issue their own money<br>supply<br>this is why america went to war against<br>the brits this is why they killed the<br>red coats<br>people need to learn this stuff they<br>can't tax us into prosperity<br>they can't keep stealing from us the<br>rich avoid the taxes the poor need to do<br>the same<br>we need to take the banks back we need<br>to own our own credit</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
