font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>infection is war and like War your body<br>takes it very seriously training<br>different cell populations for different<br>jobs and missions when you're infected<br>the first troop on the job is the<br>nutrifil also known as the granula site<br>and its mission is very simple chemical<br>warfare to take out as many of the bad<br>guys as you can unfortunately during<br>this process it can also cause a lot of<br>collateral damage harming the healthy<br>surrounding tissues and also destroying<br>itself much like a comicazi pilot now a<br>healthy body does produce neutrals at a<br>constant rate but not very many so when<br>an infection does come along and these<br>reserves rush into action they're very<br>quickly depleted and your body's left<br>scrambling to train Replacements it does<br>this through a process called emergency<br>Gran pis interestingly this process<br>doesn't just produce more neutrophils<br>but also better stronger ones that are<br>somehow more resilient so they're able<br>to last longer to give you a better<br>defense the aim of my research is to<br>decipher these codes and figure out what<br>messages are being sent from the side of<br>infection that tell the rest of your<br>body hey we need help send more nutrifil<br>and how these instructions somehow<br>improve nutrifil function like<br>everything else in your body these are<br>of course coded for in your DNA so I'm<br>looking for the specific genes involved<br>and how they are controlled and<br>regulated all right why do we<br>care<br>well we don't know very much about<br>emergency Gran pises but what we do know<br>is that sometimes these messages are<br>confused or intercepted and would you<br>want to give a comicazi pilot the wrong<br>directions take ratard arthritis for<br>example in in people with this disease<br>their nutrifil are rushing into action<br>but there's nothing for them to fight<br>They're just causing a lot of tissue<br>damage in other disorders there is no<br>call for backup so no Nutri fills are<br>produced and then the people can't<br>protect themselves from dangerous<br>infections so how do I plan to go out go<br>about finding about this finding this<br>information well first well sorry the<br>easiest way possible of course just by<br>looking back and watching it I know that<br>sounds a little farfetched how am I<br>going to watch DNA well this is where<br>the zebra fish comes in I use a zebra<br>fish in my research for a number of<br>reasons first when young it's completely<br>transparent and second It's relatively<br>simple to produce a transgenic an<br>this means that I can fluorescently<br>label different genes that I think might<br>be involved and watch in real time in a<br>living organism how their expression<br>changes in response to something like an<br>infection I can then combine this<br>information with drug screens to find<br>different chemicals that can be used to<br>modify these messages at different<br>points during their Transmission in this<br>way when something does go wrong we'll<br>have a better idea of where to look and<br>how we might actually fix it so in this<br>way the goal of my research is to<br>improve Communications with within your<br>body so that it only goes to war when it<br>needs to and can fight more effectively<br>when it does</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
