font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you all for coming tonight i'd<br>like to thank my supervisors for their<br>support throughout my thesis<br>and thanks also to my participants who<br>allowed me to film them and observe<br>their behaviour while they were training<br>a good start to the christmas holidays<br>is not seeing your dog stick their nose<br>in your mother-in-law's crutch<br>you will not get good christmas presents<br>dog training is really important and not<br>just to make it through family holidays<br>but to take best possible advantage of<br>this animal's unique abilities<br>dogs can find and missing loved ones we<br>use them to find landmines they can<br>sniff out cancers<br>dogs guide blind people work on farms<br>and help us save our kiwi<br>dogs can benefit people's health<br>they facilitate people meeting in<br>communities and thousands of them are<br>our pets<br>in all of these roles training is<br>required and the aim of my phd is to<br>help improve the efficacy of dog<br>training<br>i've been studying what people do when<br>they're training their dogs and in<br>particular i've examined their timing of<br>reinforcement<br>reinforcements the technical term for<br>what is often called rewarding a dog<br>when reinforcement is given after a dog<br>performs a behaviour it will increase<br>the likelihood of that behaviour<br>occurring again so for example if you<br>ask a dog to sit and when it does you<br>give them a pet it's more likely to sit<br>again next time<br>from studies on other animals we know<br>that delaying this reinforcement can<br>impair learning but this hasn't been<br>studied in dogs<br>what research has shown is that dogs are<br>remarkably responsive to human body<br>language for example a dog is more<br>likely to disobey a command if a person<br>is not watching them<br>because dogs are so receptive to our<br>behaviour it's likely they're also<br>sensitive to the timing of reinforcement<br>i filmed owners training their dogs at<br>local dog clubs i used computer software<br>to measure their timing of reinforcement<br>and found that it was extremely variable<br>some owners reinforce their dogs almost<br>immediately whereas others took over six<br>seconds and that's a long time if you're<br>a labrador<br>a lot can happen during these delays and<br>this may be problematic for learning new<br>tasks<br>a second finding was that 44 of owners<br>commands resulted in nothing the dogs<br>completely ignored their owners for<br>almost half the time and that's not very<br>efficient training<br>my next step is to set up some training<br>exercises in a laboratory setting where<br>i can control the owner's timing of<br>reinforcement<br>i'll put the dogs and their owners in<br>separate rooms and use audio visual and<br>remote controlled equipment to control<br>when the dogs receive the reinforcement<br>from their owners and some of this will<br>be delayed i'll then measure how well<br>the dogs respond to the different delays<br>dogs are amazing animals and we use them<br>for really important things and unless<br>you don't really like your mother-in-law<br>i hope you'll agree with me that 44<br>disobedience is not that good and we<br>need to do better<br>i hope that my phd will contribute to<br>better trained dogs whether they're<br>searching for landmines or just keeping<br>their nose to themselves at christmas<br>time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
