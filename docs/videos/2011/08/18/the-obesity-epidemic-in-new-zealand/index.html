growing obesity epidemic and how to avert it. <br><br>Commissioned by the University of Otago's Edgar National Centre for Diabetes and Obesity Research, this video highlights the devastating impact obesity can have on individual health and the unbearable strain an unchecked epidemic will put on New Zealand's health services.<br><br>The video explores how to change the current "obesogenic" environment -- which provides easy access to far too much energy-dense food and does not encourage physical activity -- to one which supports people to make healthier lifestyle choices.<br><br>Features comment by leading obesity researchers and interviews including a School Principal, MPs and the Managing Director of McDonald's New Zealand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

whose<br>responsibilities as New Zealand's<br>waistline it's a very interesting way of<br>asking a question people do know what to<br>eat and the main and they do know that<br>they should be physically active the<br>difficulty is making those behavior<br>changes we don't need to smoke we don't<br>need drugs<br>we don't need output but we need to eat<br>three times a day and that is what makes<br>this whole issue so extremely complex<br>the bay city is probably one of the most<br>I think obesity is a problem for two<br>reasons one it is extremely common in<br>New Zealand and most other countries<br>worldwide and secondly the consequences<br>of obesity are absolutely horrific<br>perhaps diabetes is the most important<br>of all but I think people forget that<br>even cancers are strongly associated<br>with obesity I think the most important<br>point to make is a negative one to start<br>off with and that is there's no way that<br>this can be due to genes genes can't<br>explain why obesity has become an<br>epidemic over a relatively short period<br>of time so it must be either to do with<br>lack of physical activity or<br>inappropriate eating it has been said<br>that we live in a toxic environment<br>which is not only because the air is<br>polluted or the water is bad we are<br>walking around where there are ads there<br>are signals there are smells<br>there are signs all the time telling us<br>to eat the treatment of obesity is<br>extremely difficult the drugs that we<br>have are totally ineffective<br>and in fact there is not a single really<br>useful drug available I was at the<br>hospital one day the doctor told me you<br>know you 140 kilos and every<br>classification I was wrong why<br>cholesterol was wrong my diabetes was<br>wrong everything that you get tested for<br>for the vitals of life what weren't<br>happy like my doctor the spared people<br>do know what to eat and the main and<br>they do know that they should be<br>physically active the difficulty is<br>making those behavior changes because of<br>how we live well I used to be a great<br>poem an and a sausage man roasts loved<br>them like I basically cut them out and<br>every time I saw saucers are just to be<br>a freak out because I thought no don't<br>get it don't get it when you decide that<br>you want to lose weight or you've put<br>behaviors in place to make that actually<br>heaven<br>you know you're talking about a major<br>life change for many people have got to<br>change your your whole life if you like<br>rather than just diet or change a few<br>foods or things like that I've been<br>swimming for about 30 years<br>that exercise wasn't enough felt or I've<br>got to do something more so I doubled my<br>swimming times that helped their work we<br>bit and then thought well I'm going to<br>really have to try something else<br>so I brought a bike and in 12 months I<br>did 12,000 kilometres that is a hard job<br>to get rid of weight taking me about six<br>years to lose my 30 kilos but it's been<br>a good six years when you look back<br>treating people who are appreciably<br>obese or even overweight is not an easy<br>task it requires a substantial<br>commitment on the part of people who<br>want to lose weight and the real hope of<br>dealing with the epidemic of obesity<br>we don't know that prevention works<br>there's been a lot of studies and<br>different countries show that prevention<br>can work they can work in schools that<br>can work in communities that can work<br>and workplaces environmental change is<br>an absolutely critical component in<br>I think it is up to a whole range of<br>actor groups who are responsible for<br>making policy via policy at a national<br>level or local level to create the<br>appropriate environment one example of<br>an actor group is of the group of people<br>who employ other people and if you<br>employ people you can play a very<br>important role in providing an<br>environment which is conducive to<br>appropriate choices some employers<br>provide gyms employers can provide<br>appropriate foods in their canteens so<br>there are a substantial number of things<br>that employers can do perhaps the most<br>important environmental change is<br>provided by governments who can provide<br>regulations or make laws to ensure<br>appropriate environments the government<br>legislates and all sorts of areas knew<br>they legislate on smoking they legislate<br>on seatbelt use they legislate on all<br>sorts of things you know we will<br>legislate for a number of things and<br>people are still going to break the law<br>we legislate for tobacco displays at the<br>age of purchase off of tobacco with big<br>road safety plans but people are still<br>going to speed and not use their<br>seatbelts<br>there doesn't seem to be anything that<br>we can do to encourage this government<br>we did manage with the Labour government<br>to persuade them to set up a nutrition<br>fund for schools to introduce healthy<br>school food guidelines and to it's been<br>quite a lot of money on education<br>programs targeted children to encourage<br>healthy eating the previous government<br>introduced a mechanism by which it<br>became inappropriate unacceptable to<br>provide an excessive amount of energy<br>dense foods to children at schools the<br>current government believes that telling<br>children what they should eat at school<br>is a nanny state philosophy and has<br>removed this regulation this isn't a<br>government that's too worried about<br>points of principle or poster campaigns<br>or engineer campaigns what we really<br>want is to invest in things that were<br>banning pies from touch shops at school<br>wasn't working the kids just took off<br>across the road and went to the local<br>dairy we do live in a free society where<br>people are free to make choices for<br>themselves even when those choices are<br>their choices now there is pretty much<br>worldwide acceptance amongst people that<br>are regarded as authorities in this<br>field that creating a healthy<br>environment at school which includes a<br>healthy eating environment is an<br>essential component I see it every day<br>when people Tommy there are no fat kids<br>in your school you know they're all<br>skinny if you'd been here six years ago<br>we were to look like most New Zealand<br>schools where there was a wide range of<br>sizes<br>schools make the decision as to whether<br>they should be dispensing machines from<br>which children can buy energy-dense fast<br>foods we don't have a school tuck shop<br>because the kitchen produces all the<br>food say there's no chance you'll be<br>able to stop in and get a pie or a V or<br>a packet of lollies and in fact there's<br>very little chance you'll get them from<br>our local dairies around here to because<br>the children have been active and going<br>into our dairies and asking them not to<br>sell those types of foods to our<br>community schools can decide whether to<br>have Gardens where children can learn<br>how to grow healthy fruit and vegetables<br>and learn how delicious they are when<br>they're eaten fresh throughout the<br>school we've got this cope up or this<br>philosophy where we will grow a healthy<br>Chi we will prepare it in the<br>traditional ways that we can and then we<br>will share it with each other<br>there are studies showing that if you<br>teach children early life to enjoy a<br>variety of foods they're more likely<br>later to make those healthy choices<br>because you can't enjoy your food you<br>never seen before you're like I'm always<br>encouraged by our five year olds who are<br>new to the school and how quickly they<br>pick up on that Co cover of growing<br>something watching it looking after it<br>watering it nurturing it feeding it and<br>then the delight on their faces and they<br>the reason that a lot of fast-food<br>companies will not make moves in this<br>area is that quite often it reduces the<br>taste because we all like that result in<br>our food and secondly and sometimes the<br>toughest thing to get your head around<br>is it also costs more I don't think that<br>there is any doubt that one needs to<br>think very seriously about what happens<br>in fast-food outlets because a large<br>proportion of the population are regular<br>consumers of their food we've changed<br>the oil that we cook in which is taking<br>about seven hundred and thirty thousand<br>kilos of saturated fat we've have the<br>sugar in our buns I would have to say<br>that from what I have heard about the<br>attempts be made by McDonald's that they<br>are making some real attempts to provide<br>alternative options<br>McDonald's launched our Weight Watchers<br>partnership in the start of 2010 and for<br>me I think that was groundbreaking stuff<br>that we partnered with an outside party<br>and created some meals that were<br>endorsed or evaluated on the same<br>criteria as every other food was crowded<br>in New Zealand what I think is<br>interesting about that whole area as<br>we're as where are those foods targeted<br>I don't think that those foods are<br>targeted to people who currently eat<br>vergis I think they're trying to<br>actually get a new market and so they're<br>trying to actually get them the the<br>girlfriend or the mother perhaps who<br>will go to McDonald's and have a salad<br>and if I announce at the table we'll<br>have the other food so while I applaud<br>them for introducing those menu options<br>in my mind they're not introducing them<br>to replace the other foods because that<br>doesn't make good business sense let's<br>face it they're actually just trying to<br>increase their total market I don't<br>think it's really plausible that fast<br>food will go away<br>I just don't think consumers behavior<br>and the way society is moving towards<br>that we will eliminate fast food so we<br>have to find a way to work together to<br>influence behavior within the category<br>temptation is one of the hardest things<br>in the world to get away from<br>trust me it is ah there's no doubt that<br>advertising work in our best level of<br>events for that is that they do it we've<br>made the decision to only advertise a<br>lot of choices part of a happy meal<br>which is the sea chicken snack wrap the<br>apple slices and the drink and what we<br>found is that now 50% of those meals the<br>child is taking up one of those options<br>there is evidence from Canada that if<br>children are not exposed to these<br>adverts<br>where they are encouraged to ask their<br>parents or to select for themselves in<br>appropriate energy dense foods that they<br>do not do so we do have the ability to<br>influence people we do have the ability<br>to influence children we actually found<br>that was quite a positive thing one of<br>the most important things that<br>government can do is to not only<br>discourage but to prevent food<br>advertisements which encourage children<br>to make inappropriate food choices to be<br>screened at times when children likely<br>to be watching television so is there a<br>place for healthy fast food in New<br>Zealand well it depends on what you<br>define as healthy I think there is room<br>for fast food that is healthier than<br>what it is today oh I think believe the<br>doctors in that when they tell you being<br>overweight ain't good like I know<br>there's a lot of people around that are<br>overweight they have no problems but the<br>majority have problems and if you've got<br>as many as I got you wished you never<br>had we still need to take a long hard<br>look at ourselves as a country look at<br>what we're doing to our children and<br>look at what we're doing to our families<br>and think about the holistic the bigger<br>picture and how we can support each<br>other<br>so the media health-related<br>organizations schools employers and the<br>food industry all have a role to play<br>along with government in changing the<br>obesogenic environment we have to fix<br>this problem because society will not be<br>able to cope with a<br>occurrences of leaving the situation as<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
