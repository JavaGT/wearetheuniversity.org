font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so the next one of our<br>presentations the theme or the thesis is<br>storms in the brain are they predictable<br>will you please welcome to the stage<br>Assan<br>neab good evening and first of all I I<br>would like to thank my family who are<br>thousands of miles away from here<br>because of their Endless Love thank you<br>my supervisory panel here here in Bato<br>University and my special Thanks goes to<br>aliser Steiner as my chief supervisor<br>because of his support and advice thank<br>you everybody for coming this evening<br>let me to introduce one of the most<br>complicated creatures in the world<br>ladies and Gentlemen please don't think<br>about the galaxies I'm talking about<br>human brain which is composed of<br>billions of that kind of cells<br>neuron let's do a very simple electrical<br>measurement on it have a look at the<br>voltage which is due to different ionic<br>concentrations among its membrane<br>and he is a characteristic of a living<br>neuron because our neuron is is alive so<br>he has the right to have some fun how by<br>opening and closing the ionic channels<br>on his membrane he can play beautiful<br>songs however he's not the only<br>residence of our<br>brain he's in Communications with<br>billions of other neurons which will<br>respond to him by singing and playing as<br>well and this will be the lovely life<br>Symphony but sometimes because of some<br>reasons this Orchestra will refuse to<br>perform properly instead of playing<br>trumpet they will blast in their<br>wua and the saddest story will happen a<br>storm in the<br>mine biolog is call it<br>seizure and suddenly the person will<br>fall<br>down among about 50 million people in<br>the world are suffering from this these<br>seizures and the very interesting<br>question is that are they<br>predictable lots of valuable research<br>has been done uh by biologists in this<br>field but unfortunately still many<br>unknowns so recently mathematicians<br>decided to help by biologists how based<br>on biological evidences they have<br>offered some mathematical equations the<br>very interesting thing about these<br>equations is that if you solve them and<br>plot the result you will find a mimic of<br>real biological records so we have a<br>kind of mathematical model capable of<br>reproducing real biological<br>records all right what am I doing in my<br>PhD research<br>generally I am playing with these<br>equations where in my Virtual Lab which<br>is my computer I'm doing lots of<br>equations solving these equations<br>finding the result comparing them with<br>biological records are they agree if not<br>it means that my model needs some<br>modifications so I will repeat this Loop<br>until somewhere I will get consist<br>results and this is where I have reached<br>a kind of intelligent mathematical model<br>which is capable of describing<br>underlying biological phenomena such as<br>that<br>seizure and maybe predicting these<br>good Lord that is fantastic I did a year<br>of uh philosophy of the brain at otago<br>University and came out more confused<br>than I was when I started so that is<br>fantastic</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
