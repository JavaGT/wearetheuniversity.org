a<br>bachelor of engineering majoring in<br>cyber security<br>I'm honored to be to be here today<br>presenting as a part of the faculty of<br>engineering of here tirangawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>today I'm going to tell you two stories<br>from a university life nothing too long<br>just two stories<br>my first story is about making a<br>decision I stepped into my final year of<br>high school knowing that I need to make<br>a decision for what I want to do for the<br>next five years of my life not wanting<br>to waste a dime on my student loan not<br>wanting to go back to my parents asking<br>for money and not wanting to do anything<br>that I didn't like<br>how did I know whether I liked something<br>without actually doing it so I scrapped<br>the light metric and went with the money<br>metric I knew that Engineers were a<br>well-paid job I'm not as prestigious<br>doctors as in my parents opinion but<br>still acceptable<br>well all my sisters were engineers both<br>civil and software so I chose between<br>the two with my career all paved out to<br>make sure that I made the best decision<br>I went to lecturers I went to Career<br>Fairs I even went to talk to lecturers<br>one of which was in Welsh the cyber<br>security lecturer of Victoria University<br>in Wellington<br>when I met up with Ian in the University<br>I thought<br>this University is an interesting place<br>well the first artwork that I see of a<br>blank canvas<br>interesting<br>was a lecturer walking into a bathroom<br>with no shoes<br>interesting<br>now with the lecture convincing me to do<br>cyber security in a dark room<br>interesting<br>I thought of this University as a place<br>where people could be themselves Express<br>themselves and be appreciated for it<br>I didn't know who I was or who I wanted<br>to be<br>but I knew that I could find myself here<br>looking back four years later<br>I'm sure for many of us not a lot of<br>factors were used to make a decision on<br>who we are or who we wanted to be<br>we need to experiment with different<br>things in the picture to make sure that<br>we make the best decision for ourselves<br>giving ourselves a playing field just<br>like the blank canvas<br>my second story<br>passion and rejection<br>talking here today I'm a different<br>person than how I was as a second year<br>as most students I believed that<br>University would prepare me for the<br>industry believing that if I'd done well<br>academically I would be able to get the<br>job that I wanted believing that<br>everything will soon fall into my lap<br>I strive to get good grades in high<br>school because I knew that if I'd come<br>home with an A plus or an Excellence<br>grade my parents would be proud and<br>happy of me and within within the<br>competition on my four sisters<br>stand out to be the best or the smartest<br>one<br>this belief of doing well academically<br>stood close to me in University too<br>with the addition of finding the jobs<br>from the top companies and with the top<br>salaries<br>so I worked very hard in University<br>I did the assignments the moment they<br>were out never using late days and<br>always doing more than what the<br>assignment asked me to do and I was able<br>to get good grades from this and in some<br>sense I built myself a confidence wall<br>where I was so confident to go and apply<br>for internships as a second year<br>university student<br>believing that if I'd done well<br>academically good prospects and work<br>would come to me<br>so I applied for jobs relating to my<br>degree like a security engineer intern<br>but I got rejected once<br>twice<br>Thrice<br>wine<br>because when people ask me what I did<br>outside of my time to show that I like<br>security<br>I said nothing<br>I said nothing because I thought that if<br>I'd done all the assignments in my<br>degree I would be able to get the job<br>that I wanted<br>I never considered why I studied not for<br>my parents not for the competition<br>within my sisters and not for the top<br>the rejection was hard to take in it was<br>hard because it made me think back to<br>all the efforts that I put into Academia<br>for my entire life<br>it made me think back to all the<br>stressful moments that I had when doing<br>my assignments<br>but the best thing that this rejection<br>did to me<br>was that it made me realize why I even<br>applied for the role<br>I applied because the role was<br>interesting I liked security because I<br>liked understanding how hecka's thought<br>process were to solve a problem<br>and that's when I realized<br>if you have a passion<br>practice it<br>from that day onwards I started<br>following security blogs doing security<br>tutorials and participating in<br>hackathons that grew security into a<br>passion that it is for me today<br>passion isn't something that just drops<br>onto your lap one day it is something<br>that you continuously nurture throughout<br>your life<br>and from that day onwards I would wake<br>up every day asking myself this one<br>question<br>if I only had one day to live today<br>would I continue to do the things that<br>I'm going to do<br>this is an extreme situation<br>but in this situation we no longer care<br>about Fame fear of failure or even how<br>others perceive us as Steve Jobs once<br>said<br>instead we only focus on what makes us<br>happy and what gives us a purpose to<br>live<br>getting good grades or doing projects in<br>the industry isn't about getting their a<br>plus grade or getting a job promotion<br>it's about how you can use those<br>learnings to achieve the problems that<br>you like whether it be for yourself and<br>or others Grays don't exactly Define how<br>much learnings you get from a course but<br>only to find a certain scope within it<br>and I know it's hard not getting the<br>result that you wanted especially<br>because we look back to all the efforts<br>that we have put in<br>but it is exactly when we look back to<br>all the efforts in which we realize we<br>put in all the efforts and lift no<br>regrets<br>instead of pondering why we didn't get<br>the result that we wanted instead we<br>should focus on being proud of ourselves<br>and how we can use those learnings to<br>achieve the next goal<br>there may be some of you sitting here in<br>the audience today not knowing what your<br>passion is so how do you find your<br>passion<br>my sister's opinion is about doing<br>something that you're good at because<br>doing well in something you will<br>ultimately feel and hear the positivity<br>from yourself and others to continue<br>now a common mishap that I see from this<br>is that people can easily give up on<br>something just because it's too hard<br>like in how First Years the assignments<br>get harder and longer to do as time<br>progresses<br>but the fact is<br>sometimes you need to LEAP past that<br>hardest point and that's when you begin<br>to connect the dots and use your own<br>interpretation to solve the problem the<br>problem is no longer defined by a<br>lecturer but instead defined by yourself<br>sometimes you may feel powerless when<br>you're trying to solve a problem for<br>example for myself I used to never say<br>that I'm doing this for the greater good<br>because I look back to all the amazing<br>seniors in the industry who have lived<br>up to that saying until one day one of<br>my managers Lucas saworski told me this<br>he said<br>we are investing in you<br>because you are our future<br>you and your generation will determine<br>how our future and how our company will<br>run in the next 5 10 20 30 years in time<br>so don't feel powerless and don't give<br>up on something just because it's too<br>hard because ultimately your hidden<br>passion will also be too hard to see<br>it is when you leap past that hardest<br>point in which your passion becomes<br>visible and that's we need to love your<br>passion and own your passion<br>so one key thing I want you to take away<br>today from is<br>find your passion own it and love it<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
