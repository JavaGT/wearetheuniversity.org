hunger ahanui pukaha<br>the Wellington faculty of Health<br>tawahanga Tatai hawara<br>and the Wellington faculty of science<br>tawahanga potayal<br>I'm Professor Wendy Lana I'm the Provost<br>and I'm delighted that you could join us<br>this afternoon to celebrate the<br>achievements of your family member<br>friend or colleague<br>as well as being proud Spectators you<br>are also formal witnesses

live<br>stream so particularly warm welcome to<br>you<br>I'd now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of taharangawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and gentlemen I present to you<br>in a manner in a row in a ewe namata<br>Waka utamotu kotuno kifakanui itinera no<br>my hirimai picky Mikey Tini Hui fakapumo<br>toyamai okotuwaka kitelio's Regal Waka<br>tenakoto tenakoto<br>tenakoto katoa<br>ladies and gentlemen this is a<br>celebration<br>but it's a celebration in a university<br>so expect some Latin<br>it's a celebration of our students and<br>their achievements and their hard work<br>and their insight and their study<br>it's a celebration of all of you who<br>have supported them uh on that journey<br>and in that study it's a celebration of<br>the academic community of this<br>University in our professional staff and<br>the people who have supported all of<br>them from within uh tehringa waka and<br>it's a recognition that universities<br>continue to play a powerful part in our<br>community and together we will shape the<br>future<br>it's a statement of pride<br>a statement of pride in you our<br>graduates and what you have achieved a<br>statement of pride in our community<br>students academics alumni and all the<br>others who connect with our University<br>a statement of commitment to Excellence<br>in academic study at a time when<br>Excellence is a notion which comes under<br>pressure<br>and a statement of recognition<br>that universities matter and if<br>universities aren't funded appropriately<br>students aren't supported appropriately<br>and our community is not able to<br>function appropriately society as a<br>whole suffers<br>our mission matters<br>now I know to many people the mission of<br>the university is a bit of a mystery uh<br>they think they're sort of crusty old<br>academics and funny little officers<br>doing research about things that are<br>Arcane and don't matter so if any of you<br>are in the audience can I just suggest<br>that you listen to the presentations<br>about the phds that are going to be<br>presented shortly because these are<br>people our students who are doing<br>Cutting Edge research supported by the<br>academic cohort behind me who are doing<br>cutting-edge thinking the reality is<br>very different if you look at the law<br>and I'm a lawyer so a lawyer graduate of<br>this place so good lawyer and um well<br>actually I'm not probably a good lawyer<br>but nonetheless well leave that as a<br>second but if you look at the law the<br>mission of the university is really<br>clear there are three things one we have<br>to create intellectual Independence in<br>our students so that means simply you've<br>got to be able to think and you've got<br>to be able to think for yourself<br>second we have to do International<br>Quality research we have to be a<br>repository of knowledge and of insight<br>and expertise<br>and thirdly we have to accept the role<br>to be the critic and conscience of<br>society<br>to do that we're given a statutory uh<br>Freedom if you like academic freedom to<br>challenge received wisdom<br>to articulate new ideas so these<br>received wisdom is the wisdom of the<br>people behind me the new ideas as the<br>wisdom of the people in front of me and<br>to ensure that knowledge we that we<br>remain a relevant repository of<br>knowledge in this country and secure its<br>future<br>so we're created specifically to address<br>Wicked problems<br>and of course there are heaps of wicked<br>problems at the moment we've got the<br>climate crisis we've got the housing<br>crisis we've got the economic crisis<br>we've got the reality that social<br>cohesion is dissipating as a consequence<br>of Technologies everyone's online no<br>one's in real and they don't people<br>aren't learning how to function uh in<br>the real world and these are problems<br>these are exactly the sort of wicked<br>problems that universities are set up to<br>address thousands of years of experience<br>thousands of years of knowledge that's<br>been built year after year after year<br>the lived experience of people all over<br>the globe reflected in the knowledge<br>repository behind me and then in front<br>of me each year students who are coming<br>in young enthusiastic and old and<br>enthusiastic people who've got new ideas<br>new thinking who challenge<br>who rub up against that sort of<br>tradition and there's the Alchemy that's<br>where the magic happens so I've said<br>that we've got problems with our health<br>system and pandemic I've said that we've<br>got problems with our climate I've said<br>that we've got problems with our housing<br>and what I want to say to you ladies and<br>gentlemen is in this room we have a hell<br>of a lot of the answers<br>if we simply could Liberate the<br>knowledge the passion the<br>experimentation capability of the<br>scientists The Architects the engineers<br>the thinkers and the creatives who are<br>sitting in front of me we would be a<br>long way further forward as a nation in<br>addressing these challenges<br>now I know there's a lot of negativity<br>out there I know people are feeling down<br>so I hope everybody that is watching<br>this and actually I'd love to think that<br>all of our politicians were watching<br>this because what they will see is<br>Excellence what they will see is<br>opportunity and what they will see is<br>the reality of our future and it can<br>give them confidence in the delivery of<br>that future so to you as our Future<br>Leaders to you as members of our future<br>Society can I say thank you for your<br>efforts and we're looking forward to<br>your contribution because damn knows we<br>need it<br>uh so ladies and gentlemen I'd want to<br>recognize you and I thought I might end<br>with a poem now that's high risk in an<br>engineer's scientist sort of thing but I<br>read a book by Bill manhar and Paul<br>Callahan once called our Angels okay and<br>if they could collaborate then but a<br>poetry doesn't hurt this is a deeply<br>creative audience scientists are<br>creative people<br>obviously designers are creative people<br>obviously Architects are creative people<br>everyone here is creative so I just want<br>to give you one quick part that's why an<br>American part called William Berry and<br>it goes like this something like this<br>I'll get it slightly wrong but<br>nonetheless planting trees in early<br>spring we make a place for birds to sing<br>in time to come how do we know<br>they sing there now there is no other<br>guarantee that singing will ever be<br>and I want to suggest to you that a<br>university is exactly like that tree<br>what we are doing is creating the<br>foundation for future generations to<br>prosper to sing to flourish and to<br>create communities<br>and that is important work it's<br>important work that all the people<br>behind me do it's important work that<br>you have benefited from and we are now<br>looking forward with deep excitement to<br>what you're

to educate<br>people to see security as an accelerator<br>instead of a roadblock<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome<br>Janelle to give The Graduate address<br>good afternoon everybody my name is<br>Janelle yelen Fung and I studied a<br>bachelor of engineering majoring in<br>cyber security<br>I'm honored to be here today presenting<br>as a part of the faculty of engineering<br>of here tirangawaka Victoria University<br>of Wellington<br>today I'm going to tell you two stories<br>from a university life nothing too long<br>just two stories<br>my first story is about making a<br>decision<br>I stepped into my final year of high<br>school knowing that I need to make a<br>decision for what I want to do for the<br>next five years of my life not wanting<br>to waste a dime on a student loan not<br>wanting to go back to my parents asking<br>for money and not wanting to do anything<br>that I didn't like<br>how did I know whether I liked something<br>without actually doing it so I scrapped<br>the light metric and went with the money<br>metric I knew that Engineers were a<br>well-paid job I'm not as prestigious<br>doctors as in my parents opinion but<br>still acceptable<br>well all my sisters were engineers both<br>civil and software so I chose between<br>the two with my career all paved out to<br>make sure that I made the best visitor I<br>went to lecturers I went to Career<br>Affairs I even went to talk to lecturers<br>one of which was in Welsh the cyber<br>security lecturer of Victoria University<br>of Wellington<br>when I meet up with Ian in the<br>University I thought<br>this University is an interesting place<br>well the first artwork that I see of a<br>blank canvas<br>interesting<br>was a lecturer walking into a bathroom<br>with no shoes<br>interesting<br>now with the lecture convincing me to do<br>cyber security in a dark room<br>interesting<br>I thought of this University as a place<br>where people could be themselves Express<br>themselves and be appreciated for it<br>I didn't know who I was or who I wanted<br>to be<br>but I knew that I could find myself here<br>looking back four years later<br>I'm sure for many of us not a lot of<br>factors were used to make a decision on<br>who we are or who we wanted to be<br>we need to experiment with different<br>things in the picture to make sure that<br>we make the best decision for ourselves<br>giving ourselves a playing field just<br>like the blank canvas<br>my second story<br>passion and rejection<br>talking here today I'm a different<br>person than how I was as a second year<br>as most students I believed that<br>University would prepare me for the<br>industry believing that if I'd done well<br>academically I would be able to get the<br>job that I wanted believing that<br>everything will soon fall into my lap<br>I strive to get good grades in high<br>school because I knew that if I'd come<br>home with an A-Plus or an Excellence<br>grade my parents would be proud and<br>happy of me<br>and within within the competition on my<br>four sisters I would stand out to be the<br>best or the smartest one<br>this belief of doing well academically<br>stood close to me in University too with<br>the addition of finding the jobs from<br>the top companies and with the top<br>salaries<br>so I worked very hard in University<br>I did the assignments the moment they<br>were out never using late days and<br>always doing more than what the<br>assignment asked me to do and I was able<br>to get good grades from this<br>and in some sense I built myself a<br>confidence wall where I was so confident<br>to go and apply for internships as a<br>second year university student<br>believing that if I'd done well<br>academically good prospects and work<br>would come to me<br>so I applied for jobs relating to my<br>degree like a security engineer intern<br>but I got rejected once<br>twice<br>Thrice<br>wine<br>because when people ask me what I did<br>outside of my time to show that I like<br>security<br>I said nothing<br>I said nothing because I thought that if<br>I'd done all the assignments in my<br>degree I would be able to get the job<br>that I wanted<br>I never considered why I studied not for<br>my parents not for the competition<br>within my sisters and not for the top<br>the rejection was hard to take in it was<br>hard because it made me think back to<br>all the efforts that I put into Academia<br>for my entire life<br>it made me think back to all the<br>stressful moments that I had when doing<br>my assignments<br>but the best thing that this rejection<br>did to me<br>was that it made me realize why I even<br>applied for the role<br>I applied because the role was<br>interesting I liked security because I<br>liked understanding how hecka's thought<br>process were to solve a problem<br>and that's when I realized<br>if you have a passion<br>practice it<br>from that day onwards I started<br>following security blogs doing security<br>tutorials and participating in<br>hackathons that grew security into a<br>passion that it is for me today<br>passion isn't something that just drops<br>onto your lap one day it is something<br>that you continuously nurture throughout<br>your life<br>and from that day onwards I would wake<br>up every day asking myself this one<br>question<br>if I only had one day to live today<br>would I continue to do the things that<br>I'm going to do<br>this is an extreme situation<br>but in this situation we no longer care<br>about Fame fear of failure or even how<br>others perceive us as Steve Jobs once<br>said<br>instead we only focus on what makes us<br>happy and what gives us a purpose to<br>live<br>getting good grades or doing projects in<br>the industry isn't about getting their a<br>plus grade or getting a job promotion<br>about how you can use those learnings to<br>achieve the problems that you like<br>whether it be for yourself and or others<br>grades don't exactly Define how much<br>learnings you get from a course but only<br>to find a certain scope within it<br>and I know it's hard not getting the<br>result that you wanted especially<br>because we look back to all the efforts<br>that we have put in<br>but it is exactly when we look back to<br>all the efforts in which we realize we<br>put in all the efforts and lift no<br>regrets<br>instead of pondering why we didn't get<br>the result that we wanted instead we<br>should focus on being proud of ourselves<br>and how we can use those learnings to<br>achieve the next goal<br>there may be some of you sitting here in<br>the audience today not knowing what your<br>passion is so how do you find your<br>passion<br>my sister's opinion is about doing<br>something that you're good at because<br>doing well in something you will<br>ultimately feel and hear the positivity<br>from yourself and others to continue<br>now a common mishap that I see from this<br>is that people can easily give up on<br>something just because it's too hard<br>like in how First Years the assignments<br>get harder and longer to do as time<br>progresses<br>but the fact is<br>sometimes you need to LEAP past that<br>hardest point and that's when you begin<br>to connect the dots and use your own<br>interpretation to solve the problem the<br>problem is no longer defined by a<br>lecturer but instead defined by yourself<br>sometimes you may feel powerless when<br>you're trying to solve a problem for<br>example for myself are you interested to<br>never say that I'm doing this for the<br>greater good because I look back to all<br>the amazing seniors in the industry who<br>have lived up to that saying until one<br>day one of my managers Lucas saworski<br>told me this he said<br>we are investing in you because you are<br>our future<br>you and your generation will determine<br>how our future and how our company will<br>run in the next 5 10 20 30 years in time<br>so don't feel powerless and don't give<br>up on something just because it's too<br>hard because ultimately your head and<br>passion will also be too hard to see<br>it is when you leap past that hardest<br>point in which your passion becomes<br>visible and that's we need to love your<br>passion and own your passion<br>so one key thing I want you to take away<br>today from is<br>find your passion own it and love it<br>thank you<br>thank you Janelle find your passion own<br>it love it that's been the message all<br>afternoon what we've seen as passionate<br>people wanting to make a difference<br>wanting to create that future so thank<br>you Janelle our graduates this afternoon<br>has been a celebration of your<br>achievements and as a formal<br>acknowledgment of your admittance
