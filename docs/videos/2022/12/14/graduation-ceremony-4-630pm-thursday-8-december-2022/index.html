Wellington faculty of humanities<br>I'm Professor Wendy Lana I'm the Provost<br>of the university and I'm delighted that<br>you could join us this evening to<br>celebrate the achievements of your<br>family member friend or colleague<br>as well as being proud Spectators you<br>are also formal witnesses to these<br>official proceedings<br>a very warm welcome also to whanau and<br>Friends throughout our Tiara and indeed<br>across the globe who are viewing these<br>proceedings via our live stream uh<br>welcome to you as well<br>I'd now like to introduce you to the<br>chancellor of taharangawaka Victoria<br>University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and gentlemen the chancellor John<br>Allen<br>ladies and gentlemen it's great to be<br>here it's a celebration but because it's<br>a university celebration it's a<br>celebration with Latin uh just that's a<br>small spoiler alert the other spoiler<br>alert as I've arrived with a heavy<br>looking book that's a book of poetry<br>that's just to say to you because I've<br>been doing this at each of the events I<br>intend to inject poetry uh into this<br>that's again a spoiler alert<br>uh it's a celebration of your<br>achievements it's a celebration of your<br>graduation it's a celebration of the<br>whanau and friends who have supported<br>you to this point in your life it's a<br>celebration of our academic community<br>and the professional staff and the<br>support staff who have enabled you to<br>achieve the success and of course it's a<br>celebration of The Wider community of<br>the university the alumni and all those<br>who understand this extraordinary place<br>but it's more than that it's a statement<br>about the importance of education and<br>tertiary education in our community at<br>this time<br>it's a statement about the importance of<br>academic excellence and achievement in<br>our society<br>it's a statement about the importance of<br>academic research and the academic<br>history that sits in our universities<br>and it's a statement about the<br>continuing relevance of Universities at<br>this time in our country<br>now of course there are heaps of people<br>that would contest to that last<br>proposition<br>they think universities are full of old<br>sort of crusty academics doing Arcane<br>research about stuff that doesn't really<br>matter in offices speckled around our<br>city<br>they are of course completely wrong<br>the purpose of the university is set out<br>in the law it's quite simple<br>we have to create intellectual<br>Independence in our graduates<br>intellectual Independence we have to<br>conduct internationally International<br>standard research and teaching to create<br>a repository of knowledge and expertise<br>for the benefit of the country and we<br>have to accept a role as critic and<br>conscience of our society<br>to help do that we've got a great little<br>clause which gives us academic freedom<br>an academic freedom is simply this<br>it entitles us to test received<br>knowledge<br>it entitles us to promote new ideas and<br>it entitles us to have ideas which are<br>controversial and may not be agreed with<br>by the whole of our community<br>and there I think is the Alchemy of a<br>university<br>that extraordinary Heritage thousands of<br>years of learning from across the globe<br>that's reflected in this academic staff<br>behind me and every year that runs<br>straight into a new cohort of young<br>people who think differently about<br>contemporary attitudes who are<br>challenging and sometimes uncomfortable<br>to those traditions and out of that is<br>the Alchemy that comes in a university<br>and that Alchemy has to address in my<br>mind two things<br>first how we create a nation of thinkers<br>and people who can think for themselves<br>and second how do we apply all of that<br>knowledge and energy<br>to solve the wicked problems that are<br>confronting our nation<br>now of course most people or many people<br>not people here of course but many<br>people would say to me well how do the<br>humanities fit into that<br>what's the price of the humanities in<br>that context and that's really simple in<br>my mind<br>the humanities after all celebrate lived<br>experience of people across the globe<br>for Generations<br>the humanities help us know who we are<br>and help us know others in an<br>increasingly complex world<br>the humanities create a lay the<br>foundations for creativity and<br>Innovation which is so desperately<br>needed in our world<br>and the humanities frankly<br>bring us joy no I know that's uh that<br>possibly sounded like a soft sort of<br>statement at the end of all of that but<br>I think it's an important statement the<br>humanities bring us joy now the poem I<br>wanted to read you at the stage uh is a<br>poem with the extraordinary title with<br>thanks to the field Sparrow whose voice<br>is so delicate and humble<br>it's written by a remarkable part Mary<br>Oliver she was a Pulitzer white a<br>Pulitzer prize-winning American poet I<br>know she'll be known to many of you but<br>the particularly the particular poem<br>that I've chosen goes like this<br>I do not live happily or comfortably<br>with the cleverness of our times<br>the talk is all about computers the news<br>is all about bombs and blood<br>this morning in the Fresh Field I Came<br>Upon a hidden nest it held four warm<br>speckled eggs I touched them then went<br>away softly having felt something more<br>wonderful than all the electricity of<br>New York City<br>then all the electricity of New York<br>City<br>and in my mind that's what the<br>humanities can do for us they can create<br>something more wonderful than all the<br>electricity of New York City simply by<br>understanding people understanding place<br>understanding history understanding<br>creativity giving us music and dance and<br>Poets all the things that really mean<br>something to our humanity and that is a<br>powerful<br>contribution that you are making<br>now<br>of course right at the moment lots and<br>lots of people are feeling despondent<br>they're feeling despondent because of<br>climate change they're feeling<br>despondent because of the war in Ukraine<br>they're feeling despondent because of<br>house prices going down or up or<br>whichever way they're going at the<br>moment they're feeling despondent about<br>um about inflation they're feeling<br>despondent about all manner of things<br>and the challenge to us collectively is<br>how to resolve that and I simply want to<br>suggest to you that in this room and the<br>wisdom of the academic Traditions that<br>sit behind me and in the energy and<br>confidence and intellect that sits in<br>front of me<br>we have the capacity to address the<br>challenges that confront us as a nation<br>and a world<br>and I want to say to you<br>that we're proud of you<br>that we have confidence in you and that<br>we are looking to you for that direction<br>and Leadership<br>it's quite a challenge I know<br>but it's a challenge that you don't make<br>alone or meet alone it's a challenge you<br>meet with all the learning that you've<br>taken from our University<br>it's a challenge you meet with all the<br>colleagues who are here with you it's a<br>challenge you meet with your families<br>and friends who've supported you to this<br>point it's a challenge you meet with the<br>academic community of tehringa Waka<br>because we are all here to create a<br>better future for this planet and for<br>all peoples of this planet and I'm going<br>to use another poem I haven't got the<br>book for this one but nonetheless I'll<br>get it broadly right possibly it's by a<br>man called Wendell Berry he's another<br>American part I don't know what I've got<br>about American poets tonight but<br>nonetheless Wendell Berry is an American<br>part and this poem talks about the<br>future<br>it goes something like this planting<br>trees in early spring we make a place<br>for birds to sing in times to come how<br>do you know<br>they sing there now<br>there is no other guarantee that singing<br>will ever be<br>and so it is in my view with<br>universities universities are places<br>that create opportunity for people to<br>sing<br>and there are lots of people who would<br>get rid of them there's lots of people<br>who say they're too expensive too<br>outmoded to an efficient too inflexible<br>two whatever<br>but the truth is they work and they've<br>worked for year after year generation<br>after generation<br>and so I hope that there are people<br>watching on live stream who've got some<br>political influence tonight<br>I hope there are people who are watching<br>on live stream because truthfully we<br>need an injection of money into this<br>place we need investment in universities<br>we need investment in our students we<br>need investment in our academics<br>and that's not simply because no no no<br>no no no<br>that wasn't to get Applause that's the<br>truth<br>and we need it because collectively we<br>can help them solve the problems of the<br>world and we can help them deliver a<br>harmonious non-divided Society<br>no<br>doumaitenata<br>congratulations to you all and to your<br>families friends and whana who are

by one of our newest graduates<br>who speaks on behalf of their peers<br>this honor is awarded to someone who<br>during their time at our university has<br>exemplified the qualities that we seek<br>this evening's address will be given by<br>Rebecca Schultz who has graduated with a<br>Bachelor of Arts in Classics and theater<br>with honors<br>during her studies Rebecca was a tutor<br>in

maintaining her interest in<br>other Arts such as literature language<br>and music ladies and Gentlemen please<br>welcome Rebecca to give The Graduate a<br>dress<br>foreign<br>it's an honor to speak on behalf of the<br>students graduating today<br>I am just one individual and I know I<br>probably can't fathom the depth and<br>breadth of experiences undergone by the<br>members of this cohort<br>however I will endeavor to speak from my<br>heart and hopefully it will touch on<br>something shared by yours<br>firstly I would like to thank the<br>parents family members friends partners<br>and all other supporters who are here to<br>share in this Triumph<br>we owe our success to you<br>graduating is not just a personal<br>achievement it is the culmination of a<br>whole community's effort as those of you<br>who came here to cheer and clap for your<br>person know well<br>secondly I want to thank all the<br>University staff especially the teaching<br>staff whose labor and expertise are the<br>reason we are here<br>thank you for your passion and<br>dedication and thank you for always<br>putting students first despite having<br>your fair share of tribulations over the<br>last few years<br>now some words for my fellow graduates<br>we made it<br>yes<br>we overcame innumerable obstacles<br>whether it was the chaos of the pandemic<br>or a moldy flat or the financial burden<br>of fees and living costs<br>now is the time to swell with the pride<br>of your teachers your family your<br>friends and all your loved ones now is<br>I want to reflect for a moment on the<br>word graduate<br>as a latinist I can tell you that this<br>term derives from the Latin word grados<br>which means a step<br>when we graduate we move up a step<br>in one sense this means that when you<br>walked up these stairs to receive your<br>diploma or degree you also took a step<br>up the metaphorical staircase of<br>academic qualification whether this is<br>the end of your academic Journey or only<br>the end of the beginning you've stepped<br>up to a new level of understanding<br>experience and perspective<br>perhaps you've also taken a step towards<br>your future career or your next big<br>Journey<br>however<br>stepping up can also mean taking up a<br>mantle<br>they say that knowledge is power<br>but they also say that with great power<br>comes great responsibility<br>what we do now with the knowledge we've<br>earned is entirely up to us<br>but in order to truly graduate to step<br>up<br>I at least intend to use these hard-won<br>tools to build a better future and to<br>use my power and my responsibility to<br>give back to the loving community that<br>put me here I hope you will join me in<br>doing the same<br>once again congratulations<br>or shall I say congratulations to all my<br>fellow graduates and a profound thank<br>you to everyone in this room and<br>watching at home for making this<br>thank you for Rebecca you're right<br>entirely you have
