short because this<br>day is not about me it's about you and<br>my message is very clear your people<br>need you and need you now<br>so hurry up celebrate tonight and get<br>home<br>yeah when I was studying here probably<br>what 16 17 years ago<br>I don't want you to declare that I<br>didn't quite finish<br>foreign<br>so and also you don't have to be a real<br>expert to do real uh things you just<br>have to be a champion of Terror with<br>whanau<br>um my thing is that I come from a small<br>place called<br>and<br>there were many opportunities when I was<br>growing up so you could either be a<br>teacher who could either be a nurse or<br>and there wasn't until I came to<br>Victoria University then I have found<br>out or that I learned that you could<br>push the realmari outside of just the<br>Mirai and outside of our little Roger<br>and for me growing up actually is still<br>uh if you weren't privy to the kapahaka<br>world then a lot of mataranga slope<br>through the cracks and so I feel like<br>one of the things in my dreams for today<br>is to oh now is to fool those gaps so<br>that the matauranga goes through to all<br>our URI<br>um and I'll just<br>you know I always talk to my my<br>tamarikis and say you know don't be<br>scared of anyone don't be scared of<br>anyone the only person or the only<br>people I'm scared of is my more furnace<br>who haven't been born yet<br>because they're the ones going to say<br>how come Nanny did nothing he'll come to<br>anything<br>out to mouth so when you're making<br>decisions there when you're<br>um coming up with awesome kaupapa make<br>sure you have them in mind<br>um<br>um so yeah congratulations it's whanau<br>um<br>a lot of our series are like of about<br>going home and returning home so make<br>sure you stay connected to your Mirai<br>and take these beautiful tohu back to<br>because actually<br>car back home there's no PhD for what<br>they do there's no PhD for what our<br>nannies do on our there's no PhD for<br>what our crews and queers do five<br>quarter or day in day out so take your<br>um don't sit on them don't wear shorts<br>I'll take them back because your people<br>are waiting for you<br>uh yes<br>so um<br>didn't really come out with any thought<br>he was from here but<br>um<br>I learned a hell of a lot<br>I learned to be<br>um<br>comfortable in my skin comfortable in my<br>modern<br>so my maoritanga drives me and even<br>though we now have an Emmy the first<br>sick and White City to be nominated<br>first one to win<br>but there are four top Awards in our<br>world the World of Dance<br>and earn a little whanau a little Hub<br>who have three of them so we have an<br>Oscar we have a Grammy and now Emmy and<br>and you know not too big just respectful<br>to the academy but that Emmy is sitting<br>in the boot of my car<br>at Auckland Airport<br>waiting to make its way back to Japan<br>opening because actually that those<br>awards are not the goal they're not<br>they're not the well not for me anyway<br>if I can make their little kid in a<br>local Korea smile or be inspired then<br>that's my goal those Emmys that's to<br>please<br>because next week I'm going home to<br>scrub the Mirai floors thank you<br>foreign<br>auditions open next week so<br>audition audition beautiful thing in to<br>acknowledge all the beautiful coral way<br>and kakahu that have come up on the<br>stage today<br>um<br>graced our stage today<br>um<br>guess<br>really relying on this phone we're not<br>um and when I wrap it up soon if you see<br>me I've got plenty of inspiration bombs<br>in me but you know come and see me<br>outside or wherever and then I'm happy<br>to share some horror but what I want you<br>to do is always think of our furnace<br>they haven't been born yet
