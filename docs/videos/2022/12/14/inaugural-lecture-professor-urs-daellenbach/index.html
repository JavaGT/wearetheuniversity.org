a<br>very warm welcome to you all<br>colleagues students and our broader<br>public Community to the inaugural<br>lecture of Professor or stellenbach from<br>the School of Management<br>for those who don't know me<br>um I think just about everyone here does<br>but I'll be the instructions for those<br>that don't know me I'm Professor Jane<br>Bryson I'm the dean of the Welling<br>School of Business and government here<br>at Waka Victoria University of<br>Wellington<br>now I have had the pleasure of working<br>directly with us since I first joined<br>the school in 1999 just one year after<br>Professor dalenbach himself joined<br>he joined us from the Hess gain School<br>of Business at the University of Calgary<br>in Canada<br>where he had spent five years as an<br>associate professor<br>we have benefited from his passion and<br>expertise ever since<br>one of our most experienced experts in<br>strategic management and Innovation<br>Professor dallenbach has served our<br>community in a wide variety of<br>leadership roles<br>ranging from multiple program director<br>roles to twice acting as associate Dean<br>research to head of School of Management<br>one of his most significant achievements<br>within the role of head of school has<br>been the increase in the number of our<br>Maori academic staff and an expansion in<br>Focus within the school to include<br>mataranga anti kangamari<br>but it could never be said that uh Earth<br>focuses more on his leadership roles<br>than his teaching<br>his teaching feedback alone illustrates<br>his ability as a lecturer and tutor but<br>add to that over 15 doctoral and 20<br>Masters students successfully supervised<br>and an Innovative approach to his<br>classes including incorporating real<br>world active business cases on New<br>Zealand firms<br>and the use of extended simulations<br>Professor dalenbach's commitment to his<br>students is undeniable<br>Beyond his roles here at the university<br>auth has been recognized for his record<br>of excellence and research outputs on<br>the international stage many times<br>he has served on the editorial Boards of<br>three highly ranked International<br>journals and being guest editor for<br>others<br>he is a fellow of the international<br>Society for professional Innovation<br>management where he also serves on the<br>international scientific panel<br>he's hosted several International<br>academic conferences and perhaps most<br>notably us has been recognized a total<br>of seven times for his excellence in<br>reviewing by the business policy and<br>strategy division of the Academy of<br>management the largest Global Management<br>academic conference<br>he's never one to shy from a challenge<br>despite working in an area of research<br>that typically does not secure much<br>external funding Professor dallenberg<br>has been part of teams that have secured<br>over 10 million dollars of external<br>funding during his time here<br>his current research interests focus on<br>the management of research organizations<br>value creation and value capture<br>productivity and how resources and<br>capabilities are developed and utilized<br>to sustain competitive and Cooperative<br>advantage<br>most recently it also has been<br>co-leading a national team researching<br>both the barriers and enablers that<br>science and engineering researchers face<br>when engaging with the industry<br>particularly Maori<br>as Government funders seek to expand and<br>leverage the pathway from research to<br>successful commercialization within New<br>Zealand this work as with much of ursa's<br>past work will have significant<br>implications on both policy and practice<br>it is this work into open Innovation<br>that is the subject of Professor<br>darlenbach's lecture this evening<br>the approach has been championed to<br>business practices the world over for<br>the last two decades yet its potential<br>is not often realized<br>tonight us explores what true open<br>Innovation would involve he will<br>identify a range of barriers to openness<br>and provide suggestions for how we can<br>overcome these through Reflections on<br>it's my great pleasure to introduce<br>Professor or stellenbach and invite him<br>to the podium<br>if Vanessa's here<br>thank you all for being here especially<br>since it's quite a select group that has<br>arrived um<br>thank you Jane for those kind words and<br>for being such a wonderful colleague<br>across research and administration<br>I'd also like to thank a few others<br>before I begin and in doing so you'll<br>probably notice a word from the title of<br>my address being repeated<br>uh first I'd like to express my deepest<br>appreciation to my wife Kate without his<br>openness to coming and staying in New<br>Zealand my research Journey would likely<br>have taken a very different path<br>unfortunately she is unable to be with<br>us here today because of Father's Health<br>deteriorated rapidly last week and she<br>had to quickly fly back to Canada<br>uh Michael Coulson was a geography sorry<br>a geography academic at the University<br>of Calgary for about 30 years and passed<br>away at the weekend<br>he greatly missed<br>by his wife Marie his four daughters<br>eight grandchildren<br>and his whanau and friends so I'd also<br>like to thank Seb my son for taking on<br>the mantle of being my family's support<br>here today<br>uh second I'd like to thank Celia<br>Davenport who decide despite me stealing<br>her office in the Murphy building when I<br>first arrived in Wellington while she<br>was away on RSL remained open enough<br>uh to work with me on a range of<br>collaborative research Ventures while I<br>was already interested in Innovation as<br>a research context her connections into<br>the science system here have allowed us<br>to study key aspects often from the<br>inside<br>uh third to Steve Cummings who's<br>currently in Europe another<br>internationally recognized strategy on<br>entrepreneurship colleague here at Waka<br>who exemplifies openness in the breadth<br>of his successful Co-op authorships<br>and finally to Colin Campbell hunt who I<br>wish could have been here he was an Ever<br>smiling mentor and critical friend whose<br>relocation to otago 20 years ago<br>unfortunately curtailed a lot of the<br>joint research that we had begun<br>but more on locational influences later<br>uh let me start with a whakatoki falfia<br>tickete mataranga this proverb suggests<br>that we should fill our basket of<br>knowledge with diverse types of<br>knowledge and that we should actively<br>look for the possibilities that that<br>gives for when you stop learning you<br>will stop growing my talk this evening<br>addresses such knowledge Gathering and<br>use highlighting that there are many<br>hidden barriers to overcome in following<br>so on to open innovation<br>a topic that I've ended up researching<br>over the last 25 years without<br>necessarily sitting out to do this<br>as a well-indoctrinated academic I'm<br>going to start by giving you a<br>definition<br>uh Henry chisborough who is typically<br>seen as introducing this concept in his<br>2003 book proposed the definition I have<br>here<br>the emphasis was on purposive influence<br>inflows and outflows of knowledge as we<br>move from basic research to its<br>application<br>not just to enhance internal Innovation<br>activities but also considering how<br>knowledge might be best used externally<br>chisperer's book examined the failure of<br>Xerox Corporation to commercialize key<br>inventions from its Palo Alto Research<br>Center<br>things such as graphical user interface<br>the Ethernet or object oriented<br>programming in which they've got a<br>leader in contrast to its success with<br>commercializing laser printing<br>technology something connected to its<br>Core Business whereas those other<br>inventions were only tangentially<br>related<br>his argument about opening thinking was<br>to contrast this to closed innovation<br>that is we're an organization controls<br>and relies on its own knowledge and<br>Innovation processes entirely<br>this characterization of closed<br>Innovation was to a great extent a straw<br>man that he proposed to showcase the<br>novelty and distinctiveness of what he<br>termed its open innovation<br>other academics jumped in to critique<br>that definition as being old wine and<br>new bottles<br>uh noting that existing studies had<br>already addressed the value of<br>integrating customers or suppliers into<br>Innovation activities or having into<br>so that definition did subsequently get<br>elaborated but it continued to<br>distinguish that<br>um a firm will perhaps seek to gain<br>these advantages uh through either<br>monetary means or not but at its core it<br>still centers on whether knowledge flows<br>are crossing some sort of organizational<br>boundary<br>foreign<br>as noted in that definition open<br>Innovation was that contrast to a<br>stylized depiction of closed Innovation<br>represented here in the internal<br>knowledge flows needed to get a product<br>or service to a market from basic<br>research activities through to<br>development<br>most firms though have not operated in<br>that way for probably a hundred years or<br>more<br>okay<br>firms pursuing Innovation typically<br>recognize that it is useful and that<br>there is useful knowledge and Technology<br>outside of their organization at<br>universities research institutes or<br>controlled by their competitors<br>what has become clearer in the last 30<br>years is that the bigger problem may be<br>not that you can identify where the<br>valuable knowledge is but how you<br>actually get it inside your organization<br>and to use it<br>okay<br>so I'll give you an example from some<br>previous research that I did with a<br>colleague in Calgary<br>um there's something called horizontal<br>drilling<br>the idea of horizontal drilling was<br>widely known in the industry there were<br>presentations that had been done across<br>the whole industry everyone had access<br>um horizontal drilling was an<br>alternative to drilling a vertical shaft<br>directly into a<br>reservoir below and it cost roughly<br>three or four times as much to do<br>despite having equal knowledge many<br>firms experience very different paths<br>and very different success with uh with<br>using it with some retreating from those<br>initial attempts and and not using it<br>for another five or ten years because of<br>that poor success<br>what we identified as crucial was that<br>there was a learning orientation taken<br>by the successful firms<br>uh and that they also brought a broader<br>mix of skills and knowledge bases uh in<br>okay the problem was not uh changing the<br>angle of the drill once you're a<br>kilometer down Underground<br>the problem was actually knowing what<br>that Reservoir looked like<br>if you could hit it accurately<br>you were able to get a lot of oil out if<br>you didn't if you missed and you hit<br>only the top of that that<br>thin well your production was much lower<br>okay everyone thought that the problem<br>would be turning that corner and hitting<br>it accurately but you first had to know<br>what you were aiming for<br>okay so that was really illustrating<br>that you needed this mix of knowledge<br>you had to bring a range of knowledge<br>bases together in order to make that<br>actually occur and to have that success<br>you needed Reservoir Engineers you need<br>a geologists in your team<br>many firms just didn't do that they<br>thought all they needed was the<br>specialist to do the drilling and that's<br>so overall over open Innovation ads that<br>you have a broader range of knowledge<br>flows that will affect your success<br>these could be outside in and whether<br>you can integrate that knowledge these<br>could be inside out do you have the<br>right connections to actually leverage<br>that knowledge externally to gain<br>something from it uh Xerox didn't they<br>just tended to leave other individuals<br>form new Ventures with that or are they<br>coupled flows with a successful depend<br>on continuing co-innovation of the<br>chisborough also highlighted that the<br>ultimate use of some knowledge may be in<br>new markets and that a single<br>organization should not necessarily seek<br>to commercialize all of its knowledge<br>itself<br>okay so there was some interesting new<br>so on the face of<br>events really that new it's quite<br>interesting to see how quickly its<br>popularity has grown and that that<br>hasn't really waned as some other<br>management fads have<br>okay the top graph there is an Ingram of<br>books that use the term and how rapidly<br>it spread since 2003.<br>in that year there were 200 web links<br>for open Innovation by 2013 there were<br>480 million<br>uh chisperer's 2003 book alone has over<br>26 000 citations wouldn't we all like to<br>have that<br>um and uh of his 100 000 plus citations<br>most relate to open innovation<br>as a search term its popularity persists<br>uh across the entire globe with<br>particular prevalence in South Korea and<br>Japan as well as in Europe and<br>Scandinavian countries open Innovation<br>now has its own journal<br>a society dedicated to the concept and a<br>regular conference as well as continuing<br>focus of forward special issues<br>so perhaps the question is why this<br>um I'll start with saying that<br>Innovation remains essential for our<br>changing World particularly if we are to<br>mitigate or adapt to today's Global<br>challenges<br>for business competitive forces<br>regularly erode their current advantages<br>and these forces can be harder to<br>predict and more difficult to counteract<br>or imitate when they're based on diverse<br>knowledge basis<br>okay<br>While most of us are familiar with<br>incremental Innovations in products and<br>services such as the upgrading of our<br>phones quite regularly or universities<br>recording lectures pre-pandemic and then<br>making them available<br>um other Innovations may be less<br>apparent<br>take for example the process innovation<br>of Airlines selling tickets themselves<br>that is basically wiped out the travel<br>agents industry<br>Beyond product or process Innovation to<br>other types also exist position<br>Innovation would be where something like<br>Merino wool is used for different<br>clothing layers facilitated by<br>technology being able to measure that<br>fineness okay most of us can't tell the<br>difference between a 150 or a 180 or a<br>200 level garment but will pay for that<br>difference<br>okay Manuka Honey becoming a medical<br>product is another example of position<br>innovation<br>finally Paradigm Innovation would be<br>where an organization shifts its mental<br>model entirely such as when Fujifilm<br>moved away from Film Production to use<br>its knowledge base for skin care and<br>makeup application at the nanoscale<br>so yeah Innovation is going to be<br>important<br>it's clear that we need to innovate but<br>why open innovation<br>well for me there are always benefits<br>from accessing external knowledge not<br>just to eliminate some of our Innovation<br>paths that might not be that useful<br>openness can also be crucial for<br>efficacy speed or responsiveness<br>all you have to do is look at the<br>pandemic with off Oxford AstraZeneca and<br>that collaboration bringing a vaccine to<br>Lego is another example okay it emerged<br>from close to bankruptcy to now having<br>kids ideas developed by customers<br>who come in and say can you do this for<br>me or it has Partnerships with Levi's<br>which I just found out today uh you know<br>where it's cool to have their Lego<br>buttons on on that we have Star Wars as<br>well you have them making movies again<br>they're not doing all that themselves<br>but<br>they're utilizing their knowledge base<br>to explore these other options<br>in New Zealand uh we have a relatively<br>strong base for innovating but we invest<br>less as a percentage of GDP across<br>government and business than other<br>countries<br>we don't necessarily develop products<br>that will scale well internationally or<br>meet International needs<br>we also face a real dilemma of pursuing<br>Global markets because starting from our<br>small Market that rush to growth may<br>require Investments or commitments that<br>rapidly lead firms to fail if it's not<br>successful<br>um and frequently our entrepreneurs<br>maintain very close control over their<br>product and development are not willing<br>to relinquish some of that that might be<br>Innovations also an open Innovation is<br>also really important for Grand<br>challenges or mission-led research<br>okay so if you'll see yourself in this<br>photo it wasn't because you were coming<br>something I picked well beforehand<br>um<br>it's particularly important for these<br>sorts of things like meeting you in<br>sustainable development goals or you<br>know a mission like getting to Mars and<br>exploring that<br>um you the scale the complexity of those<br>challenges the urgency with them<br>requires a more open approach<br>you're going to need a<br>multi-disciplinary or perhaps an into<br>disciplinary or transdisciplinary team<br>in order to achieve it you're going to<br>need collaboration between universities<br>Crown research institutes industry Maori<br>in New Zealand in order for it to be<br>truly radical or successful you want to<br>seek ambitious novel Solutions you're<br>not going to get that from our ordinary<br>approach to research<br>you want to connect the social world to<br>the laboratory to the experimental<br>domain<br>okay<br>so let me illustrate some of these<br>aspects a little bit more and I'm going<br>to deviate from the typical one-way<br>Communication in inaugurals by giving<br>you a situation and asking you to come<br>up with your top of Mind answer to this<br>don't worry I won't be making judgments<br>of this and Sally you're going to have<br>to not participate because you've seen<br>this before<br>okay consider this dilemma<br>you have something fragile at the top of<br>a cliff<br>and you need to get it to the bottom<br>without breaking it<br>okay real engineering problem here you<br>need to do it in a matter of days or<br>maybe hours what might you do what sort<br>of solutions come to mind<br>sorry<br>airlift it okay<br>trampoline at the bottom okay<br>carefully carrot but you might need to<br>build a path first or something<br>so all of us will tend to rely on our<br>own experience our own knowledge base in<br>coming up with these Solutions<br>might come up with<br>an example that Katie came with<br>um of someone who works in the freight<br>industry will probably think of maybe I<br>need to package it right so that it<br>doesn't break<br>okay slow it Forward cushion its impact<br>the trampoline okay<br>what about a zip line could have been<br>another solution<br>okay everyone typically reverts to their<br>core knowledge and solutions will tend<br>to be incremental variations of that<br>poor knowledge rather than something<br>radically new or different an<br>interdisciplinary team is likely to<br>so again yeah for me open Innovation<br>will be crucial for solving this sort of<br>challenge<br>let's look<br>look real example and for this I'm going<br>to draw on something from the science<br>for technological innovation National<br>Science challenge<br>um Swifty something that I've been part<br>of something that a few members of the<br>audience here are also part of<br>okay<br>consider the goal of developing a three<br>billion dollar blue economy in New<br>Zealand by 2035 although I think now<br>they've revised that to wanting to do it<br>by 2030. yeah we're going to need new<br>technologies we are going to need boys<br>we're going to need centers we're going<br>to need underwater drones perhaps<br>okay<br>that's going to need a range of<br>scientific disciplines<br>this stuff was going to need to be<br>robust every time I've attended a<br>meeting of these scientists they keep<br>mentioning that oceans eat technology<br>okay so again you're going to have to<br>involve a range of of disciplines in<br>order to get the right solutions to make<br>useful products here<br>aquaculture occurs offshore and it's<br>moving further out so the cost of<br>visiting or checking any of these Farms<br>is growing quite a lot it costs<br>thousands of dollars to take a boat out<br>to a Muscle Farm just to check whether<br>the warning and Signal lights are still<br>working<br>okay so to get to three billion dollars<br>we're also going to need more and better<br>data<br>but really you want it processed first<br>into information or knowledge before<br>it's sent back on tour because satellite<br>communication is really expensive<br>okay so again you're going to want to<br>add new disciplines in there you're<br>going to want to add artificial<br>intelligence or machine learning<br>if you don't think of that stuff at the<br>beginning of the project you get a much<br>smaller solution this that the product<br>will take a whole lot longer to get to<br>uh it's commercializable outcome if it<br>um<br>I got another example of why you might<br>want to have multiple stakeholders in<br>the room<br>okay<br>most most scientists have never visited<br>a muscle fund okay so if you can get the<br>scientists out there they'll learn more<br>about the the situation that they're in<br>okay if you look at that drone there<br>okay they might not think about the fact<br>that a cable is going to be quite<br>problematic around a whole string of a<br>set of muscles<br>so if they begin to learn that earlier<br>they might think about having a remote<br>control drone<br>for something like 50 that's an even<br>um<br>what about the senses part of it<br>um I was at an industry meeting early on<br>in the project where scientists were<br>brainstorming what sort of Senses they<br>um and one of the scientists indicated<br>that he could measure the size of the<br>Plankton or the algae that was in the<br>water to a very high degree of accuracy<br>it's later a muscle farmer stood up<br>and candidly said so that's cool but<br>what good is it to me<br>the muscles eat what they eat I can't<br>change that<br>the scientist was naturally a bit<br>deflated but a few minutes later stood<br>up and said what if I could tell you<br>where the bigger food was<br>that could be it filtered out and<br>immediately there was a response here I<br>can do something with that<br>okay because I can raise or lower the<br>muscle strength<br>so you can see how the science gets<br>changed when you have these interactions<br>occurring at different parts of the<br>project<br>there will be a much earlier development<br>of perhaps where<br>that the site the different sizes are<br>rather than okay the average size within<br>this uh this amount of water is this<br>sort of protein or lipid or whatever<br>so you're going to want those<br>interactions<br>um you're going to uh want that to speed<br>up the science moving it from being cool<br>to being cool and practical<br>but the benefits of from involving those<br>multiple discipline uh disciplines and<br>stakeholders may be quite clear<br>but why don't we then see more open<br>Innovation happening around the world<br>okay well it could start with just the<br>fact of trying to secure that sort of<br>cooperations trying to secure that sort<br>of access will cause concerns<br>um samford's isn't going to let everyone<br>out to their muscle Farms every day but<br>that might be what's necessary<br>you're likely going to have to have a<br>whole lot of previous interactions to<br>build up trust before the those industry<br>Partners will invest that sort of time<br>and resources<br>foreign<br>there are other barriers as well those<br>complex multi-disciplinary<br>multi-stakeholder teams are actually<br>very difficult and time consuming to<br>initiate and manage<br>the formation and management of those<br>teams often goes unfunded in our science<br>system<br>okay something I'm personally<br>experiencing at the moment I think I<br>spend more time on Contracting and<br>chasing invoices than I do sometimes on<br>University industry research<br>collaboration in New Zealand does not<br>have a great track record<br>it might be a little bit better for the<br>research institutes but even 10 years<br>ago someone like Industrial Research was<br>searching for ways to build a better<br>connection with the majority of New<br>Zealand businesses that hadn't actually<br>been coming to them for their services<br>which led to something called the what's<br>your problem New Zealand challenge where<br>they gave away a million dollars of r d<br>okay again something initiated out of<br>some collaboration out of Victoria<br>University that might not have occurred<br>otherwise<br>I I we could say that this is just a New<br>Zealand problem but it's actually<br>similar overseas although it does vary<br>places like Finland uh industry will<br>actively invest in supporting PhD<br>students<br>who will then go through their studies<br>looking at problems that have relevance<br>another part of this is that University<br>researchers worldwide like their<br>autonomy<br>most of us like to choose what we<br>research<br>isn't that what you want though<br>motivated researchers clever people<br>doing what they want<br>but at that extreme this could lead to<br>research for researchers sake<br>key aspects of such date of such<br>thinking are deeply ingrained in our<br>science system and science systems<br>around the world<br>uh the venova bush quote there that I<br>have<br>um argues that there is value in<br>separating basic research from practical<br>ends something that open Innovation<br>argues against<br>he says you can't predict with accuracy<br>what purpose the research might end up<br>influencing so the researchers are seen<br>to be best placed to determine the<br>crucial areas for their critical<br>endeavor<br>and research policy in those countries<br>becomes to ensure that there are<br>sufficient basic research funded<br>nationally by the government in order to<br>have the right stockpile of knowledge to<br>support Industries to compete<br>internationally<br>another issue in this whole system is<br>that the predominant Focus for<br>University researchers is Publications<br>the university culture its incentives<br>and processes limit the value of active<br>activities Beyond this<br>you just have to look at how publishing<br>enough research forms the key threshold<br>in our promotion decisions<br>few trade-offs against research are<br>possible a slow shift is sort of<br>occurring to look at citations maybe<br>reads maybe downloads<br>but could you offset Publications with<br>consulting or Contracting<br>I should argue that those would be good<br>things to occur in order to have this<br>cooperation happening between<br>universities and Industry yet it's not<br>something that's necessarily valued<br>a few academics do manage uh to pursue<br>this is a virtuous cycle<br>but for most adding these sort of<br>activities is yet another Demand on<br>could you imagine how someone would take<br>perhaps a sabbatical or a succumbent to<br>go and start a venture and how they<br>would actually then get back into the<br>university system<br>that would actually be really hard to do<br>as a result there's little researcher<br>efforts directed towards anything post<br>publication<br>some of us might write a conversation<br>piece but many of us won't<br>might not even be acceptable to do that<br>for some articles<br>so we might seek at times to inform our<br>students but what about connecting to<br>others maybe that's an area where we<br>have to do more work<br>for me this means that any attempt to<br>open up behaviors has to overcome the<br>inertia associated with traditional<br>tricks and school cards and universities<br>and those are very deeply embedded<br>and barrier is sort of that divide<br>between research and Industry we're seen<br>to speak very different languages<br>academics are regularly encouraged to<br>alter their communication<br>to teach uh to something that reflects<br>the real world of business<br>that we're not what we teach isn't<br>reflecting that real word it's the<br>argument<br>some argue that understanding the other<br>languages language is very important<br>otherwise we end up talking past each<br>other with the same word being<br>interpreted differently by the different<br>parties<br>or if we don't understand these sorts of<br>things we might forget to observe<br>important tikanga or protocols when our<br>such groups have very different time<br>frames goals and principles for<br>researchers a two-year research project<br>seems short<br>some of our publication decisions take<br>almost that long<br>for business three to six months is<br>basically what they might tolerate<br>yesterday would be really good<br>okay<br>researchers aim for validation and<br>replication<br>business wants something that's workable<br>or better than what they have<br>researchers want rigor impartiality<br>Detachment practical relevance things is<br>what businesses seek<br>okay I'm purely pointing out these<br>things as differences not that either<br>perspective is inherently better<br>as with research most businesses<br>struggle to break out of their framing<br>of issues<br>again quoting van of our Bush industry<br>is generally inhibited by preconceived<br>goals by its own clearly defined<br>standards by the constant pressure of<br>commercial necessity if you ask them<br>what your our research should consider<br>it typically involves something quite<br>incremental based on our current<br>situation<br>or if I quote one of our safety<br>researchers Industry pool and science<br>research Drive can align if you already<br>know exactly what you're going to do<br>but if that's uh going to be but that's<br>not going to be very stretchy at all<br>because if you know what you're doing<br>that's not actually research it's<br>development<br>okay meaningful collaboration needs a<br>foundation of trust and such differences<br>that I've pointed out here will affect<br>that<br>as does the current low level of<br>interactions between uh industry and<br>University in New Zealand<br>foreign<br>he's got something else to do<br>um a third barrier relates to IP<br>concerns<br>um<br>firms have a very strong desire to seek<br>competitive Advantage from any<br>Investments they make in r d even if<br>they are only providing time or access<br>to things rather than financial or<br>physical research resources our research<br>has highlighted the IP concerns will<br>frequently be raised early on and can<br>quickly become very contentious<br>uh you just have to look at some of the<br>quotes I've got up there<br>again you'll see how small shifts in<br>language will affect perspectives<br>okay industry wants it open to us<br>or them in particular<br>versus a researcher probably wants it<br>open to everyone open source may be<br>their ideal<br>the drive for publication that I noted<br>earlier will create another issue within<br>this<br>another point of conflict since timely<br>publication impacts when something<br>whether something will remain<br>proprietary or not<br>okay I'd also note that such uh<br>conflicts are we equally apparent<br>between industry members<br>I recently observed a two-day Forum<br>seeking to explore Innovation and<br>collaboration possibilities<br>and for one and a half days of the<br>two-day Forum progress was impeded due<br>to the prevailing industry view that<br>investing resource and r d meant that<br>each firm should exclusively own that IP<br>eventually following a technology<br>demonstration by a scientist and a<br>presentation by a managing director from<br>an engineering company completely<br>outside of the sector<br>uh it became apparent to the industry<br>members there that there actually would<br>be projects of common interest and<br>benefit to them<br>and particularly those that were<br>um where the value relative to the cost<br>was actually insufficient for any single<br>business to invest in them alone<br>okay so for me<br>University science may have a role to<br>play in actually facilitating some of<br>that coopetition between industry<br>members<br>um overcoming this sort of Ip barrier<br>overall will require having those<br>discussions very early on in the project<br>I don't think they often do occur early<br>on in the projects<br>um<br>and would involve specifically<br>specifically involving knowledge about<br>potential Pathways one of the things<br>that safety has done is to employ a<br>commercialization manager where they<br>come into every project and they say so<br>have you thought about where this might<br>go have you thought about who you might<br>talk to<br>and then also perhaps involving uh<br>specialists in terms of managing IP at<br>that point as well<br>otherwise you know IP is going to sort<br>of remain there in the background as a<br>contentious thing and properly derail<br>some of the cooperation that you might<br>want<br>so<br>um what else<br>might our research do to overcome some<br>of the barriers to open innovation<br>I'd say firstly we'll need to put some<br>incentives and probably even<br>requirements in place for open behaviors<br>okay however that sort of incentive or<br>requirement in itself is unlikely to be<br>sufficient to generate Quick Change<br>for me you just have to look at Vision<br>mataranga policy and how long it's taken<br>for that to gain a whole lot of traction<br>VM requirements and research grants have<br>been around for quite a few years now<br>often though these were simply a section<br>that you completed in the application a<br>section that wasn't necessarily as fully<br>planned out or elaborated on whence the<br>application was successful<br>okay when you undertake this sort of<br>basic research it's intentionally got<br>uncertainties involved in it it involves<br>taking risks it's very costly and<br>difficult to determine the reasons for a<br>project not meeting some of its<br>objectives including why they might have<br>had less engagement or collaboration<br>than they expected<br>there are also incentives for<br>researchers to delay reporting certain<br>things<br>especially when they're not occurring as<br>they propose because the funding might<br>be taken away from them<br>okay thus science grants generally<br>aren't that actively monitored and<br>there's good reasons for that<br>uh with the monitoring only occurring at<br>critical Milestones or at after its<br>completion<br>and when that occurs uh there is little<br>that can be done about something that<br>wasn't achieved<br>like your VM intentions if they weren't<br>successful<br>again one of the interesting things is<br>our research has highlighted that<br>um scientists researchers are actually<br>quite open to external engagements<br>okay<br>um but with the science being their<br>primary focus those parts of the project<br>uh tend to be given lower priority and<br>are then less fully developed<br>safety's approach has been to assign a<br>theme leader to all projects<br>um and that's been very favorably<br>received sometimes they just say oh it's<br>great to have someone interested in how<br>our research is going<br>but they are then also able to monitor<br>whether certain things are occurring<br>they can help Mentor them through those<br>steps and to see whether those outcomes<br>uh what has also become clear within<br>safety is that more open engagement will<br>require a different set of skills and<br>capabilities skills that many<br>researchers often haven't developed<br>even if they're quite senior<br>furthermore such capacity development is<br>typically not funded as part of the<br>research<br>I would note here that the University's<br>own mataranga Maori research fund would<br>be an example of trying to address this<br>sort of deficit where you can work get<br>funding to develop those sorts of<br>relationships<br>are the capacity development activities<br>might also be available but there is<br>often limited availability of those and<br>they might not fit well with the<br>research time frame<br>funding for something like science<br>leadership course unfortunately doesn't<br>align well with the typical budget lines<br>in the department or at the project<br>level<br>overall what I've tried to highlight for<br>you here though is that we shouldn't<br>jump to the conclusion that a lack of<br>openness or open Innovation is due to<br>poor intentions or lack of Interest by<br>researchers<br>uh we're then universities we have paid<br>little attention to our human or<br>relational capacities and as a result<br>this has likely impeded the extent to<br>okay so taking a more holistic<br>perspective on this<br>um it also requires us to examine what<br>open actually means and what that<br>entails<br>dictionary definition it's a lack of<br>secrecy concealment<br>frankness if I went to the strategy<br>lecture I'd be getting terms like<br>transparency or inclusivity uh being<br>mentioned but if I started on those I'd<br>probably have to start my inaugural<br>again so I'm not going to do that<br>uh instead I'm going to boil it down to<br>five more commonplace questions<br>it comes down to thinking about who<br>that's more than just a count of who's<br>there but what sort of parties you're<br>deciding to involve a medical researcher<br>collaborating with a clinician is a good<br>start but if they collaborate with the<br>same clinician all the time it's not<br>really that open<br>okay<br>win<br>what some of our researchers found out<br>that researchers prefer to collaborate<br>externally at only certain parts of the<br>of the project<br>sort of happy to do it at the beginning<br>because they can talk about all the<br>things they're going to do they're<br>probably happy to do it at the end again<br>but less happy to do it in the middle in<br>fact what we found is that they will<br>decrease and narrow their collaborations<br>during that phase<br>it's quite natural they want to do the<br>research they're busy doing the research<br>but again you might not get some of the<br>benefits I pointed out earlier if you<br>don't have that ongoing collaboration<br>and Industry probably isn't going to<br>feel very great about being asked to be<br>part of it initially and then not being<br>part of it again through the middle<br>so that wind might be a really important<br>part<br>what are you going to collaborate on and<br>this researchers are certain about their<br>findings as I said they may be less<br>inclined to be open<br>even though they'll share some things<br>with some people sometimes they won't<br>share it at others because they haven't<br>where another thing that we found that<br>was really important was<br>moving where the collaboration occurred<br>okay something simple like taking the<br>scientists out to a muscle fund or even<br>different members of a team going to<br>someone else's lab to see what they do<br>to see what sort of equipment they had<br>was really important to the<br>collaboration and the success of that<br>okay so you've got to have some openness<br>there and you want to try those things<br>out<br>to identify how best to interact with<br>external stakeholders<br>I do a range of different approaches<br>have been tried I would say that some of<br>them have worked better than others but<br>again as part of our research we're<br>still trying to figure out exactly which<br>of those will work<br>visual on-site face-to-face options seem<br>clearly richer and seem to generate more<br>commitment and reciprocal sharing from<br>those external collaborators<br>however such options again come at<br>significantly greater cost to the<br>project<br>so let me just move on in my last few<br>minutes here to some insights and<br>implications I think what we have to do<br>is recognize the costs associated with<br>being open it's not easy being a big<br>um I think we also have to make sure<br>that there are Criterion incentives for<br>that openness and then figure out how to<br>monitor those in an effective way within<br>universities<br>um we should try and seek meaningful<br>collaboration opportunities with our<br>stakeholders<br>um<br>um<br>the last two points here I think we<br>should really consider openness to be a<br>team phenomenon<br>okay versus an individual outcome one of<br>the things that we tend to do is to say<br>okay that's a useful thing for an<br>individual have to have and we make sure<br>that everyone should get that<br>okay but a research team actually<br>provides a range of different options<br>does everyone in the research team have<br>to have every capability to have to do<br>everything in the project maybe you<br>could actually facilitate and remove<br>some of the work that's involved by<br>having different people specialize on<br>that doesn't make them less a lesser<br>member of the team but it actually could<br>make the team function better and for<br>this external collaboration to work<br>better<br>uh lastly I'd say that too many of our<br>activities are currently not funded in<br>the system or not counted as a cost by<br>the system<br>all you have to do is look at the number<br>of research applications that are<br>unsuccessful that's over 90 percent of<br>Marsden grants the effort that goes in<br>on a yearly basis to putting those<br>applications in is huge why do we make<br>them so big<br>from a university perspective I'd say<br>why do we make our promotion<br>applications so big<br>okay without such changes as a whole<br>growing openness and Innovation is going<br>to remain a hope without a clear<br>supporting strategy or practices<br>so I'm going to leave you then with just<br>a few takeaways<br>um while many and would argue that human<br>bearing beings are inherently social<br>creatures most of us are social on our<br>own terms<br>each individual will respond based on<br>personal factors as well as contextual<br>ones<br>I'm actually a really good example I<br>have quite a few research collaborations<br>so you might see me as open my school<br>managers one is who's<br>represented here seem to think that I<br>love making speeches I don't but I will<br>win the context or the role requires it<br>my daughter not here uh complains about<br>how quiet I am but put me on a<br>volleyball court and I'm actually a<br>different person<br>okay<br>if you see me at an event you'll often<br>find me at the outer edge that may<br>probably be by choice I'm a bit happier<br>there okay so one's openness to external<br>collaboration is probably similar to<br>one's willingness to communicate in a<br>second language sometimes you will<br>sometimes you won't<br>one of the research projects that I was<br>hoping to complete on my leave<br>um was actually looking at this analogy<br>second language theory is quite<br>developed and has established models on<br>this<br>whether that behavior behavior is likely<br>to occur<br>in the right social setting where an<br>individual feels safe they may be<br>willing to try out their pepperha that<br>same person even an hour or a day later<br>may be unwilling to do this<br>if the attitudes or the climate have<br>seems to be different some circumstances<br>will mean that their needs to feel in<br>control will dominate any desire that<br>they may have for affiliation<br>okay if it's that complex just for<br>communicating a second language why<br>should we expect that our willingness<br>and openness to collaborate would be any<br>a second takeaway would be to seek and<br>to take those opportunities uh to build<br>our capabilities<br>it's something that I've done in the<br>last few years as a researcher so much<br>of our focus is on technical Excellence<br>but we need these other capabilities<br>a key question is to when to build those<br>capabilities<br>particularly relative to the<br>opportunities to use them if you build<br>them and then don't use them they<br>probably fall out of um you know fall<br>out of mind<br>another question will be who is best<br>place to assist those capabilities what<br>you need to develop<br>and safety we've tried during this doing<br>this during the process projects and<br>getting the person to self-assess what<br>they need and there's been quite varied<br>my last piece of advice here is<br>something that I've tried to follow more<br>actively in recent years the university<br>regular runs uh training on unconscious<br>bias I think that they're openly<br>available to everyone<br>um but I'm not sure<br>um<br>and<br>our desire to remain in control May well<br>be one of these biases<br>however an openness to research<br>opportunities has led me into some quite<br>different directions beyond the<br>collaborations that I've had with my<br>strategy and Innovation colleagues<br>these include a study on remote work<br>with Rebecca Downs<br>to understanding capability assessment<br>as part of a master's supervision with<br>Noel Donnelly<br>uh as well as something called the dark<br>Triad managerial characteristics with<br>Jared Tower at aut<br>I haven't regretted diversifying my<br>research to these at all and generally<br>they have ended up informing other<br>research or activities of mine in ways I<br>didn't anticipate which would have made<br>a remaining question for me uh following<br>all of this research is the extent to<br>which open Innovation once or open<br>activities once learned will step for<br>our University researchers<br>there are such strong norms and<br>institutional pressures that drive<br>decisions in ways that are not always<br>open not always relational or connected<br>how can we overcome these unless<br>openness is a core value for us as<br>individuals as well as for our<br>organizations and institutions I think<br>this will remain sporadic<br>so I think I'll conclude here I'm given<br>my focus on openness and open Innovation<br>it seems strange to me that I will not<br>take questions because that's what the<br>process is<br>uh but I'm happy to discuss this and<br>other aspects with you later uh this<br>evening or at any other time uh Kiara uh<br>uh something that I have learned in the<br>last few years is that finishing with a<br>yata could be appropriate but you really<br>don't want to hear me sing that's also<br>one of those instances where my openness<br>typically retreats instead uh here is an<br>imminent Professor from the University<br>of Exeter with a song composed uh for<br>we've been innovating now for quite a<br>long time it's the big thing that's<br>helped us to survive<br>find new ways to do things keep on<br>learning down the line it's what keeps<br>you and me and companies alive<br>we've learned how we can manage it how<br>to repeat the trick all about the<br>structures and the routines<br>but that world still keeps on changing<br>so we need to change with it innovate<br>our model look through a new lens<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>my name is Todd Bridgeman for those of<br>you don't know me I am acting head of<br>the School of Management uh for 12<br>months so in my learned colleague he has<br>the opportunity as he mentioned to take<br>his research and study leave and<br>progress<br>um these important ideas<br>and my role here is to provide a vote of<br>thanks I will keep it brief I know that<br>I stand between you and the refreshments<br>in the foyer but I did want to take a<br>few minutes just to recognize the<br>contribution that always has made to the<br>School of Management the faculty and<br>also the university and I Echo<br>everything that Jane said in her<br>introductory remarks you have certainly<br>demonstrated excellence in your research<br>the very well cited papers earlier on in<br>the career uh your career of the<br>resource based view of the firm and<br>Strategic Management folding I guess<br>nicely into this open Innovation I'd<br>left the Gap in my notes to try and make<br>sense of your your speech as you gave it<br>slightly risky strategy and in all girls<br>were Outsourcing very prepared but I I<br>looked at your slides and I didn't<br>really get a sense of it but now<br>listening to it I think I've got a<br>better understanding of what you've been<br>doing for the past 60 years that we have<br>been colleagues in the School of<br>Management and in some ways I was<br>sitting there thinking I'm probably the<br>worst person to be giving this vote of<br>thanks because I did my PhD on<br>commercialization and the relationships<br>that academics have outside the<br>university<br>but I was the arch critic of those so my<br>interest was in academic freedom and<br>academic autonomy and I what I think is<br>is the very privileged but valuable role<br>that universities plan society as<br>relatively independent of external<br>stakeholders and therefore not swayed by<br>their influence in the commercial<br>imperative<br>so you know on the one hand I think we<br>we stand in opposition there but as I<br>was I was listening thinking about it I<br>was thinking we share something in<br>common and while it is a very modern<br>take on the University as an institution<br>I also think it reflects what I've<br>always understood as the essence of the<br>university and what makes the university<br>this one but all universities I think<br>really precious institutions and that is<br>the diversity of perspectives or the<br>knowledge types or or whatever you want<br>to see it as whether that comes from<br>inside the walls of the Ivory Tower or<br>through engagement with people outside<br>is that the openness of us as academics<br>of our students of other staff of people<br>who we engage with to A diversity of<br>perspectives to be what I would call and<br>what I teach my students kind of<br>critically reflexive<br>that we are open to our own World Views<br>being challenged by others and learning<br>through engagement with others and<br>that's always been very special for me<br>for the University I think has really<br>exemplified in the work that you've done<br>so that's that's terrific<br>um you've demonstrated excellence in<br>teaching as Jane said particularly with<br>your work on uh simulations that bring<br>our students or give our students as<br>close as possible the experience of of<br>running businesses and making decisions<br>and seating the impact of those<br>decisions while still in the classroom<br>and I certainly think that you've<br>demonstrated excellence in leadership<br>and that is something that I just wanted<br>to say a bit about<br>as some of you will know I have an<br>interest in leadership I teach a course<br>on our emba called leading change I'm<br>really interested in what we in society<br>I guess understands good leadership to<br>be or strong leadership<br>I'm interested in how those<br>understandings of what constitutes good<br>leadership has changed over time<br>and I'm interested in how we teach<br>leadership to to our students here in<br>the business school<br>I think in my view a dominant<br>understanding of leadership for the past<br>30 years has been this idea of the<br>transformational leader<br>uh the person with Charisma with great<br>oratory skills with grand Visions for<br>transforming organizations that they're<br>part of real Risk Takers<br>and that can certainly have great<br>benefit for organizations but um coming<br>as I do from a critical management<br>perspective I've always been fascinated<br>by the dark side of that particular<br>conception of leadership<br>where we have often I think aspirational<br>individuals come into organizations<br>sometimes seeing their stay in the<br>organization as a stepping stone towards<br>their leadership portfolio and because I<br>I think the vision of the<br>transformational leader has been<br>dominant that encourages individuals to<br>come in with their grand Visions whether<br>they know much about the organization or<br>not seek to implement them but to very<br>quickly move on to the next organization<br>using that status of having transformed<br>the previous one to get them the next<br>job without really I think hanging<br>around to see if those Transformations<br>have benefited the organization or not<br>and I think your style of leadership has<br>been very different to that<br>you've been here<br>for 23 years<br>you understand is it more<br>25.<br>okay my math is bad<br>I'm not a quantitative researcher<br>yeah 23 or 25 you understand better than<br>most of us here I think<br>um<br>about this place about the history of<br>this place about what makes this place<br>special about ideas that we've tried in<br>the past<br>and a real I guess care for this place<br>and I think that's that's something to<br>be really acknowledged I've said it<br>before I'll see outside again you have<br>an encyclopedic knowledge of the<br>institution<br>if I ever needed to know what to do in<br>relation to the math of bureaucracy that<br>the organization is I always came to you<br>first and pretty much always got got the<br>answer<br>and I think that institutional knowledge<br>is really valuable<br>I would also say your your style of<br>leadership<br>is selfless<br>and I think that is evidence through a<br>number of activities some of which Jane<br>has mentioned the numerous reviewing<br>awards that you have received I think<br>absolutely evidence of<br>the willingness to put your time into<br>the scholarship of others and I know<br>having been a journal editor how hard it<br>is to get people to review papers and<br>Conference papers and and the people<br>that put genuine efforts into developing<br>the scholarship of others is often<br>unacknowledged or under acknowledged in<br>a really vital part of what we do I<br>think it's been evidenced your selfless<br>leadership in the management of the<br>science project what you said before<br>about you know spending a lot of your<br>time Contracting and<br>invoicing so you know that is the the<br>part of the administrative task I think<br>in in terms of bringing these different<br>people together and enable them to get<br>together and share perspectives and and<br>generate these open Innovation and<br>different ideas and I also have seen it<br>in your uh your role as head of school<br>which you will be coming back to at the<br>end of your RSL your interest in genuine<br>interest in other staff care for the<br>school care for the for the business<br>school and the university but also<br>willing I think to to uh<br>speak on behalf of the school and and<br>maybe stand and fight on behalf of the<br>school in certain situations has been<br>has been very much valued so it is in my<br>view<br>um not necessarily transformational<br>leadership or what we often regard as<br>strong leadership today but I would say<br>genuine academic leadership in both<br>research teaching and service that<br>really needs to be recognized and<br>encouraged and therefore I am delighted<br>that we've been here tonight to<br>celebrate your promotion to the rank of<br>Professor<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
