only a few years ago that I was<br>in the same situation as you the<br>graduating class<br>I attended Victoria's graduation<br>ceremony in 1976 and 1977 in the town<br>hall next door<br>I still have very warm memories of my<br>time here at Vic and for my favorite<br>professors whose lectures seminars and<br>one-on-one conversations<br>shaped my interest in becoming a<br>professor<br>in those days there was no PhD degree<br>here in business here at Vic and so they<br>encouraged me to go to the US to study<br>for my doctorate<br>and that proved to be a turning point in<br>my life<br>for you the graduates of 2022<br>this day also marks a turning point<br>most of you have now completed 16 or<br>more years of formal education you've<br>attended countless classes read<br>thousands of pages of text written<br>hundreds of papers projects and exams<br>and on top of all that you had to deal<br>with the disruptions and challenges of<br>covert<br>with classes online<br>and all the frustrations that brought I<br>can sympathize with you only too well<br>so congratulations to all of you on your<br>accomplishments and particularly on your<br>resilience<br>during these difficult few years and<br>your commitment to completing your<br>studies this is truly a day for you to<br>celebrate your years of hard work<br>and effort<br>but today also gives us the opportunity<br>to look back<br>and give thanks to those who helped us<br>get to where we are today<br>none of us graduate from University<br>without the help of others<br>our parents friends families sacrificed<br>encouraged and supported us along the<br>way<br>my parents passed away in the last few<br>years and I wish I had told them more<br>often how much I appreciated their help<br>I hope they knew how much it meant to me<br>so I would like you all I give you the<br>chance to stretch your legs and stand<br>and turn around<br>and I'd like you to share your thanks<br>and Ovation with your parents and your<br>families<br>today is also a time to remember the<br>remarkable teachers and professors who<br>helped you get to University and to<br>graduate today<br>for me two of my college professors were<br>particularly important they made history<br>and English both come alive for me and<br>inspired me to become more Curious to<br>read more to think more clearly and to<br>become a better writer<br>and here at Victoria I had some<br>outstanding professors who could<br>contributed to my growth in education<br>they were special teachers engaged in<br>the classroom devoted to their students<br>learning and they became my role models<br>one of my regrets is that I didn't reach<br>out to thank them until later in my life<br>at which point several had passed away<br>so I'm sure you can name and the<br>teachers and professors who've made a<br>difference in your life<br>and my advice is don't wait to thank<br>them<br>graduation is also a time to look<br>forward to the opportunities that await<br>you<br>many of you probably already have jobs<br>in hand and if not you have some ideas<br>on your next steps<br>it's easy to think about your future<br>careers in personal terms the supporter<br>will allow you to provide your families<br>the status power and yes money that you<br>may accumulate<br>that I believe is the chancellor just<br>mentioned earlier that much more is<br>expected of you than just personal<br>success<br>the world faces so many vexing<br>challenges<br>our ways of life are threatened by<br>climate change<br>Innovations in technology provide<br>opportunities to make our lives easier<br>but also threaten to increase the gap<br>between haves and have-nots to undermine<br>individual privacy<br>and to sow misinformation that<br>destabilizes<br>democracy in our institutions<br>these are challenges that you and your<br>generation face<br>as you take on these challenges<br>I believe that there are lessons you can<br>learn from the successes and failure of<br>my generation<br>My Generation has succeeded certainly in<br>leveraging remarkable new technologies<br>to create products and services that<br>have transformed our lives and created<br>enormous economic wealth<br>and they have gained engaged in Commerce<br>globally allowing people in many<br>emerging countries to prosper<br>however in country after country<br>we have failed to recognize the<br>importance of building the broad<br>consensus required to address Collective<br>problems like climate change inequality<br>misinformation and lack of privacy these<br>can't be by definition addressed by a<br>single person a single leader a single<br>company or even a single country<br>it falls on your generation to<br>collectively take up the call to address<br>these problems before they overwhelm us<br>this is a Herculean task<br>it will require you to use all the<br>learning you have accumulated all the<br>experience you will amass in the future<br>and a willingness to become leaders who<br>work for the betterment of your<br>community the country and the world<br>but I'm optimistic<br>I teach and meet young people like you<br>from all over the world<br>I've seen close up their passion for<br>making a difference and the energy and<br>Innovation they bring<br>so my hope for you is that you Embrace<br>these challenges and become the leaders<br>so congratulations to you all today<br>enjoy and celebrate the moment and best<br>wishes to you all as you become the<br>leaders that I hope you all become thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
