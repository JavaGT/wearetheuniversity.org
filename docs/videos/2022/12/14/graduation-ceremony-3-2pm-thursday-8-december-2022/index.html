the Wellington<br>School of Business and government<br>I'm Professor Wendy Lana I'm the Provost<br>of the university and I am delighted<br>that you could join us this afternoon to<br>celebrate the

and<br>Friends throughout aotearoa and from<br>across the globe who are viewing these<br>proceedings via our live stream a<br>particularly warm welcome to you<br>I'd now like to introduce to you our<br>Chancellor the chancellor of taharang<br>Walker Victoria University of Wellington<br>this is a role that dates back to the<br>Middle Ages when the first universities<br>were established<br>the chancellor is the chair of the<br>University Council which is the<br>governing body responsible for setting<br>the University's strategic Direction<br>ladies and gentlemen the chancellor John<br>Allen<br>Automotive<br>foreign<br>ladies and gentlemen<br>welcome to a celebration<br>this is a celebration of our graduates<br>it's a celebration of your whanau it's a<br>celebration of our academic community<br>and the professional staff and support<br>staff who support them it's a<br>celebration of your achievements your<br>work and the results that you have<br>delivered<br>and it's also a statement<br>it's a statement about the importance of<br>education and advanced education in<br>aotearoa and in our world<br>it's a statement about excellence in<br>academic achievement and its continuing<br>importance to our country<br>it's a statement about the strength of<br>our academic community and the wisdom<br>that they are able to impart to you with<br>the support of the professional and<br>other staff<br>and it's a statement about the<br>continuing relevance of University<br>education in this country<br>of course University doesn't always get<br>a good rep<br>some people think that there are dusty<br>sort of offices somewhere with old<br>academics studying Arcane things that<br>don't really matter<br>there are even people that think that<br>studying law or business at a university<br>is inappropriate because it has<br>apparently some sort of monetary award<br>associated with it<br>the reality is that given the challenges<br>faced by our country and our community<br>given the role that we are charged with<br>by our government and our community as a<br>university<br>we are delighted to be teaching you we<br>are delighted to be graduating you and<br>we are delighted to be celebrating with<br>your whanau and friends in this<br>remarkable achievement<br>now when I talked about the mission of<br>the University<br>which I did but I don't think I<br>mentioned it particularly strongly but<br>nonetheless when I talked about the<br>mission of the University I noticed that<br>the lawyers in the room went straight to<br>thinking about the training and<br>Education Act part four<br>because you'll all know the training and<br>Education Act part four you'll all know<br>that the purposes of the university in<br>three simple terms are to provide<br>Advanced education that delivers<br>intellectual Independence to undertake<br>International class research and<br>teaching and to become a repository of<br>knowledge and expertise<br>and to accept the role of critic and<br>conscience of our society<br>and to do that we're given a really<br>Nifty little tool called academic<br>freedom<br>and what academic freedom says is that<br>we have the ability to test received<br>wisdom to put forward new ideas and to<br>express views that are controversial or<br>not popular<br>and in that little phrase description of<br>academic freedom is the Alchemy in my<br>view of a university what you have is<br>received wisdom that's behind me that's<br>all the Brain Trust that sits behind me<br>their years of experience reflecting<br>thousands of years of learning across<br>multiple geographies<br>and then every year we have a new cohort<br>of students young people old people<br>people with different and new ideas<br>sometimes unpopular sometimes<br>controversial crashing up against<br>that huge knowledge Bank<br>helping them shift and change and that's<br>where the Alchemy of the university is<br>that's where we actually make a<br>difference as a university because<br>that's where the energy comes from<br>it's fair to say of course that the<br>purpose of that if I sort of summarize<br>it is to teach people to think for<br>themselves and to help solve the wicked<br>problems that are confronting our<br>country the wicked problems of I don't<br>know climate housing there's so many<br>crises on at the moment it's difficult<br>to list them all there are many many<br>Wicked problems that we collectively<br>need to solve the point I am making is<br>that a university is uniquely structured<br>to assist in their solution<br>of course when you talk about solving<br>Wicked problems not everybody would say<br>that lawyers and businesses are the<br>ideal way to do it because they don't<br>necessarily see those as being<br>purpose-driven occupations they see them<br>rather more in the in the sort of common<br>parlance as being associated with money<br>and I want to say to them now as a<br>person who has been a lawyer has led<br>businesses in the city<br>that they are wrong they misunderstand<br>fundamentally the law and they<br>misunderstand fundamentally the purpose<br>of business so what is the purpose of<br>law<br>well I've got so many constitutional<br>lawyers behind me who could tell me this<br>but let me give you a quick stab at<br>dicey so I would be saying to you that<br>the purpose of law or one of the key<br>purposes of law is to underpin and<br>uphold what has been come known as the<br>rule of law the rule of law that says<br>that no one is above the law that says<br>no one can be deprived of their Liberty<br>or property without action of the law in<br>front of Courts<br>and which says that everyone is entitled<br>to access to the law now I can feel the<br>memories behind me as people want me to<br>start sort of talking about what the<br>impact of uh I don't know things like uh<br>Declarations of inconsistency might be<br>or entrenchment uh which have been sort<br>of popular sort of topics in the uh<br>public narrative for the moment but the<br>simple point is that that theory says<br>nothing about money that theory says all<br>about service and commitment to a much<br>higher goal and of course in there as<br>well as the idea of the sovereignty of<br>parliament which is a challenging and<br>controversial idea uh in itself but the<br>law has higher ideals than those that<br>are ascribed by many in our community<br>and as a consequence is far more<br>important than what it would otherwise<br>be because if you don't have the rule of<br>law what you have is what we see around<br>the world in so many places<br>demagogues asserting their rights<br>demagogues who have the sort of midnight<br>knocking on the door you have The<br>Disappearance of people you have all<br>those sorts of non-constitutional<br>non-legal extra-legal processes which<br>are so damaging not only to individuals<br>but to society so I want to say to the<br>lawyers amongst you that you're right in<br>the middle of the sort of mission of<br>universities that were described as and<br>had been enshrined in this University<br>and the work you do is fundamentally<br>important now what about business<br>because everyone knows that business is<br>really just a p l and a balance sheet<br>and is all really about money<br>and I want to say to you that's<br>fundamentally wrong that businesses<br>mechanism to help people take risks to<br>help people take risks to innovate to<br>change to find the new to think the new<br>to deliver than you to improve lives in<br>their communities and within about a<br>hundred meters of this place right now I<br>could take you to a small startup<br>entrepreneurial businesses that are<br>doing just that I could take you to kogo<br>which is working I don't know I'm not<br>sure whether I'm allowed to name drop<br>individual companies but nonetheless I<br>can take you to kogo which is doing an<br>astonishing job working with banks all<br>around the world and their customers to<br>help them use their money in a more<br>sustainable way to apply their money to<br>things that have lower carbon footprint<br>it's an amazing business it's doing<br>great work I'll take you to valpara and<br>Mercer Street which is running an<br>international an internationally<br>acclaimed business using AI for breast<br>screening Technologies it's<br>extraordinary what they're doing and<br>they're doing it from Mercer Street and<br>they are genuinely saving lives and they<br>are genuinely changing the world so<br>people who say to me business isn't<br>Purpose Driven don't know business<br>people who say to me law is about money<br>don't know law and what I would say to<br>you is faced with the wicked problems we<br>have with all the challenges in our<br>world today<br>you are uniquely placed as lawyers as<br>business people as people who understand<br>government to be able to influence and<br>deliver change that's a huge<br>responsibility but it's an amazing<br>opportunity and so if I look at the the<br>extraordinary energy that we have in<br>this room the extraordinary capability<br>that we have in this room the sense of<br>community that we have in this room I<br>know that we have the capacity to be<br>able to address the challenges that are<br>in front of us now and seize the<br>opportunities of the future<br>and so it's in that spirit that I want<br>to say to you congratulations on your<br>achievement I want to say to your whanau<br>congratulations on your supporting and<br>delivering this achievement I want to<br>recognize the academic and other<br>community here for their contributions<br>to the achievement and I want to say<br>extremely well done<br>and I thought I'd stop with a small poem<br>because I know lawyers and accountants<br>and people like that are deeply poetic<br>and so I thought I'd I'd finish with a<br>small poem uh and I'm just it's just an<br>extract because I know it's not quite<br>true what I just said so I'd extract<br>from a poem by Glenn culhoon uh Glenn's<br>a doctor he went up and worked with<br>Napoli in the far north and he wrote a<br>wonderful book of poetry called The Art<br>of walking upright which is about the<br>art of standing upright here in aotearoa<br>in New Zealand he said this the art of<br>standing upright here is the art of<br>standing on two feet one is for holding<br>on the other is for letting go and I<br>want you to think about that because in<br>my mind it's terrific one you've got to<br>stand up you've got to stand for<br>something you've got to Advocate You've<br>Got to Believe In you've got to actually<br>work for you've got to hold on with one<br>foot to everything that you've learned<br>everything you value about everything<br>that you've got from your life to date<br>and then you've got to Spring Forward<br>you've got to move forward into that<br>future claim that future for yourselves<br>and help us all live a better life and<br>develop a more cohesive sustainable and<br>prosperous community in which everyone<br>can participate no don't attend our Koto<br>killed Amai tenatato

graduation<br>address<br>Chancellor<br>acting Vice Chancellor<br>graduates of 2022 staff<br>thank you for the opportunity to speak<br>to you today and for the honor you have<br>bestowed upon me<br>it seems only a few years ago that I was<br>in the same situation as you the<br>graduating class<br>I attended Victoria's graduation<br>ceremony in 1976 and 1977 in the town<br>hall next door<br>I still have very warm memories of my<br>time here at VEC and for my favorite<br>professors whose lectures seminars and<br>one-on-one conversations<br>shaped my interest in becoming a<br>professor<br>in those days there was no PhD degree<br>here in business here at Vic and so they<br>encouraged me to go to the US to study<br>for my doctorate<br>and that proved to be a turning point in<br>my life<br>for you the graduates of 2022<br>this day also marks a turning point<br>most of you have now completed 16 or<br>more years of formal education you've<br>attended countless classes read<br>thousands of pages of text written<br>hundreds of papers projects and exams<br>and on top of all that you had to deal<br>with the disruptions and challenges of<br>covert<br>with classes online<br>and all the frustrations that brought I<br>can sympathize with you only too well<br>so congratulations to all of you on your<br>accomplishments and particularly on your<br>resilience<br>during these difficult few years and<br>your commitment to completing your<br>studies this is truly a day for you to<br>celebrate your years of hard work<br>but today also gives us the opportunity<br>to look back<br>and give thanks to those who helped us<br>get to where we are today<br>none of us graduate from University<br>without the help of others<br>our parents friends families sacrificed<br>encouraged and supported us along the<br>way<br>my parents passed away in the last few<br>years and I wish I had told them more<br>often how much I appreciated their help<br>I hope they knew how much it meant to me<br>so I would like you all I give you the<br>chance to stretch your legs and stand<br>and turn around<br>and I'd like you to share your thanks<br>and Ovation with your parents and your<br>families<br>today's also a time to remember the<br>remarkable teachers and professors who<br>helped you get to University and<br>graduate today<br>for me two of my college professors were<br>particularly important they made history<br>in English both come alive for me and<br>inspired me to become more Curious to<br>read more to think more clearly and to<br>become a better writer<br>and here at Victoria I had some<br>outstanding professors who contributed<br>to my growth in education<br>they were special teachers engaged in<br>the classroom devoted to their students<br>learning and they became my role models<br>one of my regrets is that I didn't reach<br>out to thank them until later in my life<br>at which point several had passed away<br>so I'm sure you can name and the<br>teachers and professors who've made a<br>difference in your life<br>and my advice is don't wait to thank<br>them<br>graduation is also a time to look<br>forward to the opportunities that await<br>you<br>many of you probably already have jobs<br>in hand and if not you have some ideas<br>on your next steps<br>it's easy to think about your future<br>careers in personal terms the supporter<br>will allow you to provide your families<br>the status power and yes money that you<br>may accumulate<br>but I believe is the chancellor just<br>mentioned earlier that much more is<br>expected of you than just personal<br>success<br>the world faces so many vexing<br>challenges<br>our ways of life are threatened by<br>climate change<br>Innovations in technology provide<br>opportunities to make our lives easier<br>but also threaten to increase the gap<br>between haves and have-nots to undermine<br>individual privacy and to sow<br>misinformation that destabilizes<br>democracy in our institutions<br>these are challenges that you and your<br>generation face<br>as you take on these challenges<br>I believe that there are lessons you can<br>learn from the successes and failure of<br>my generation<br>My Generation has succeeded certainly in<br>leveraging remarkable new technologies<br>to create products and services that<br>have transformed our lives and created<br>enormous economic wealth<br>and they have gay engaged in Commerce<br>globally allowing people in many<br>emerging countries to prosper<br>however in country after country<br>we have failed to recognize the<br>importance of building the broad<br>consensus required to address Collective<br>problems like climate change inequality<br>misinformation and lack of privacy<br>these can't be by definition addressed<br>by a single person a single leader a<br>single company or even a single country<br>it falls on your generation to<br>collectively take up the call to address<br>these problems before they overwhelm us<br>this is a Herculean task<br>it will require you to use all the<br>learning you have accumulated all the<br>experience you will amass in the future<br>and a willingness to become leaders who<br>work for the betterment of your<br>community the country and the world<br>but I'm optimistic<br>I teach and meet young people like you<br>from all over the world<br>I've seen close up their passion for<br>making a difference and the energy and<br>Innovation they bring<br>so my hope for you is that you Embrace<br>these challenges and become the leaders<br>so congratulations to you all today<br>enjoy and celebrate the moment and best<br>wishes to you all as you become the<br>leaders that I hope you all become thank<br>you<br>foreign<br>thank you Paul a great reminder of the<br>important role of parents and teachers<br>and the the leadership challenges that<br>lie ahead thank you so much Paul<br>uh we will now return to honoring<br>graduates the pro-chancellor

graduates<br>this afternoon's address will be given<br>by Daniel Mays who has graduated with a<br>bachelor of Commerce majoring in<br>economics and information systems<br>while studying Daniel worked

February<br>this year to start a graduate position<br>as a consultant in accenture's product<br>management team where he is excited to<br>be applying his interest in the<br>intersection of Technology design and<br>people to craft digital experiences<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome<br>Daniel to give The Graduate a dress<br>Chancellor acting Vice Chancellor<br>academic staff guests family friends and<br>most importantly my fellow graduates<br>Tina Koto Tina Koto Tina kotokatoa<br>what has got my name on it that's good<br>I uh the only advice I got was that no<br>one's going to remember what you say but<br>they will remember if you take too long<br>it is an honor and a privilege to be<br>here tonight speaking on behalf of the<br>graduates in the ceremony even though I<br>can't possibly capture all of the<br>sentiments of everyone in this room I<br>hope to express at least some things you<br>can identify with here<br>I first just want to mention my relief<br>at actually being here at a graduation<br>ceremony two cancellations and a year<br>later I was really wondering if I was<br>going to be here doing this so thank you<br>to all the staff who worked tirelessly<br>to finally pull together another<br>graduation<br>I think congratulations as an order for<br>all of us for this hard one achievement<br>on varying schedules five and a half<br>years to do a three-year degree in my<br>case<br>but whatever path we took winding or<br>straightforward we can now stand here<br>proudly as graduates we did it<br>for me University was a bit of an escape<br>from life not really knowing what I<br>wanted to do or what options were in<br>front of me I went with like a lot of<br>people I would guess guess I'll go to<br>university<br>um which quickly turned into why on<br>Earth am I doing this the first time I<br>was up all night doing an assignment<br>only to realize another one was due in<br>the same week<br>but my time at University in Wellington<br>also provided some of the best<br>experiences of my life meeting lifelong<br>friends and having the opportunity to be<br>independent for the first time<br>some middle of the road experiences like<br>trekking up the various Wellington Hills<br>in various states of sobriety and being<br>too broke to actually do anything so I<br>would spend a lot of my time just<br>wandering around the city<br>and then finally some mildly traumatic<br>experiences like figuring out how to<br>survive Winters in my moldy Arrow Valley<br>flat and then the transition to studying<br>online in 2020 which for me like I'm<br>sure a lot of people was quite a<br>struggle with our habits and environment<br>thanks to those who supported us along<br>the way<br>mum dad and family for your constant<br>love and support plus the luxury of<br>going for nice dinners when you're in<br>town<br>um friends for putting up with me I know<br>it's a struggle a lot most of the time<br>and lecturers plus tutors for your<br>enthusiasm for teaching and always being<br>a great place for me to bounce ideas off<br>I uh especially once I couldn't find her<br>in the room but mum I made it I know you<br>were very worried for a few years there<br>but I did it love you<br>uh while thanking the friends and family<br>here with us today I also just want to<br>take a minute to acknowledge those who<br>can't be there<br>with this in mind on a personal note I<br>just want to dedicate this achievement<br>to a close friend of mine doc who passed<br>away last month<br>while we were fledding together he would<br>often come home after a night out see<br>that the light was still on in my room<br>because I was still studying and he'd<br>always pop in to say hi and check up on<br>me thanks for being a good sport when I<br>would get mad at you yelling at the TV<br>when you played Dark Souls and I never<br>thought I'd say this but I'll miss the<br>sound of a PlayStation controller<br>getting thrown down the stairs<br>couldn't have done it without you<br>uh to lighten the mood I want to make<br>the study link I don't know how I'll<br>ever repay you joke but I think if I<br>don't they won't let me back in the<br>country so I guess I'll have to figure<br>it out somehow<br>um to close this time for me was not<br>just about getting a degree and getting<br>a job though they were very very nice to<br>end up with it has also caused slash<br>forced I wrote down there<br>um me to grow and learn so much about<br>myself this experience has taught me how<br>capable I can be when I set my mind<br>towards something how completely<br>incapable I can be when good time<br>management would make my life so much<br>easier and it has completely changed my<br>world view and the way I think<br>University graduates we are so lucky to<br>have the connections we've made with<br>each other and the opportunity to take a<br>world-class education forward with us<br>from this evening<br>congratulations enjoy the celebrations<br>tonight whatever form they're taking for<br>you we deserve it I'm proud to be going<br>out into the world wherever I end up as<br>a graduate of
