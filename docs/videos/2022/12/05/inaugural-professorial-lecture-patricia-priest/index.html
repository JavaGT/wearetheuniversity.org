vice<br>Chancellor of the University of otago<br>and it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>you all here this evening to celebrate<br>Patricia priest's promotion to Professor<br>um<br>this is one of the great pleasures of my<br>role to be involved in in these events<br>which are great celebrations and as you<br>may be aware we've had quite a lot of<br>disruption with our inaugural Professor<br>or lectures over the past few years<br>because of covert and we've been<br>furiously catching up this year and<br>we've been doing rather well at um yeah<br>getting on top of the large number of of<br>inaugural professorial lectures and I<br>think there is probably two or three<br>false starts I think two false starts so<br>well done we've got here finally and and<br>wonderful to be here to celebrate the<br>event<br>my role is mainly one to welcome<br>everyone and it's wonderful to see so<br>many people here today<br>um we also online so welcome to everyone<br>who is watching live or watching later<br>on uh big big welcome I know there'll be<br>a quite a number and I do want to<br>welcome some special guests here today<br>click the uh Tricia's whanau and friends<br>um so I know we have uh Trisha's Mother<br>Audrey is with us today uh husband Hugh<br>and uh children Ella izzi and Arlo it's<br>a big big welcome to you I think your<br>sister Julian may be watching online so<br>it's a big welcome to you Julia and I<br>know there are a number of friends some<br>who have come from from out of town so I<br>do want to acknowledge Kerry Joni Hansen<br>and Susan who have traveled his name<br>there may be others but big welcome to<br>you all<br>um Trish um Joe's going to give a bit of<br>a a bit of a buy sketch a little bit of<br>a background to your career but before<br>that I'd just like to make a few<br>comments if I can and we've known each<br>other a long time so I'm actually not<br>going to say very much because I might<br>be stealing some Thunder for for your<br>talk so I'll make sure you go into<br>restrict what I'm going to say but I do<br>am going to just comment um as you no<br>doubt know Trish is an epidemiologist<br>and not so long ago<br>as in two or three years ago most people<br>didn't know what an epidemiologist<br>is or does let alone pronounce<br>epidemiology and that's a covert has<br>certainly changed that and ended up with<br>virtually every health professional<br>being called an epidemiologist and<br>including myself occasionally<br>I sense the tide may be turning a bit<br>because I saw some merchandise the other<br>day a mug emblazoned with make<br>epidemiologists boring again I don't<br>know and apparently this is a t-shirt as<br>well I'm not sure I didn't know that<br>epidemiologists were boring at one stage<br>but anyway they're obviously some who<br>weren't enjoying the Limelight so um and<br>of course with a lot of talk about<br>epidemiologists you might be under the<br>impression that there are lots of them<br>around and in fact there aren't lots of<br>them around and um and particularly<br>infectious diseases epidemiologists<br>they're actually quite rare they're very<br>few in in the country most of them are<br>actually vets by background<br>Trisha's The Real McCoy she is an<br>infectious<br>epidemiologist and<br>you may be aware of the roughly large<br>number of University staff have<br>contributed to the disproportionately to<br>the National covert response well not<br>all not all the the um efforts are<br>widely known and I just really want to<br>acknowledge the role that Tricia's had<br>amongst other things she was seconded to<br>the Ministry of Health as the chief<br>clinical advisory epidemiology in the<br>covid-19 health system response<br>directorate for a large portion of of<br>the pandemic and and that was a critical<br>role I think largely behind the scenes<br>but it was an important one so um<br>congratulations Trish my friend and<br>colleague<br>um really well deserved promotion and<br>I'm really looking forward to your<br>lecture and I'll hand over to Joe Baxter<br>norella ten nakoto ten nakoto<br>tenakotokatoa<br>um<br>I will kill to everyone and it is indeed<br>a privilege to have been asked to<br>introduce a peer and colleague a fellow<br>Public Health Physician<br>um Patricia Patricia praised for this<br>her inaugural professorial lecture and<br>it's fantastic take three that we've<br>we've actually made it today and I feel<br>really privileged as someone who has a<br>public health background to be able to<br>acknowledge and introduce Trish and I<br>suppose in thinking about how to<br>introduce trash I'm aware that Tricia's<br>talk is about epidemiology but<br>epidemiology sits within that context of<br>Public Health and public health is the<br>science and art of preventing disease<br>prolonging life promoting Health through<br>the organized efforts and informed<br>choices of society organizations<br>communities and individuals and I think<br>if we've learned anything from covert we<br>have seen all of those aspects of Public<br>Health come to play and I acknowledge<br>that Trisha's path to becoming a<br>professor truly embodies what it means<br>to be a public health practitioner in<br>her talk today<br>will give us a picture of that<br>embodiment of Public Health practice<br>within her academic Journey<br>so a bit about Trish Trisha is a<br>graduate from the University of otago<br>with her mbchb she has an mph from<br>Auckland and a d Phil from Oxford so<br>truly spread academic journey and<br>Trisha's journey in public health<br>medicine following training as a Public<br>Health Physician Trisha's doctorate<br>assessed the relationship between<br>antibiotic prescribing and resistance in<br>the community<br>subsequently she's worked on<br>collaborative multi-disciplinary<br>research teams on a range of areas<br>within Public Health epidemiology her<br>research increases understanding of the<br>transition transmission prevention and<br>control of infectious diseases in the<br>community this includes assessing Public<br>Health interventions from a really broad<br>range of areas and it wasn't until I did<br>this talk that I realized and some of<br>these things and some of them are a<br>little bit quirky hand sanitizer in<br>primary schools border screening for<br>influenza vitamin D supplementation for<br>respiratory infections chemo<br>prophylactus leprosy and household water<br>filters in the Pacific and I'm also<br>aware you were aware of we're part of a<br>research project that was nominated for<br>an ignoble prize I think at at some time<br>and other research aims to better<br>understand bacterial carriage and<br>transmission and identity and identify<br>modifiable risk factors for infection<br>also has a range of other roles she's<br>currently our acting provice Chancellor<br>she's been a head of a department she's<br>a previous training program director for<br>the New Zealand College of Public Health<br>Medicine and last year very much as<br>David has mentioned was contributing<br>epidemiology advice to the ministry of<br>Health's covid-19 response as the chief<br>clinical advisor epidemiology and the<br>covid-19 health system response<br>directorate<br>and I really do want to acknowledge<br>Trish and before welcoming her app to<br>present her lecturer would just like to<br>finish with the whakatoki that I think<br>is particularly relevant within the<br>those who lead give sight give sight<br>those who follow give life to those who<br>lead and I really do want to acknowledge<br>you Patricia and I want to invite you up<br>here to deliver your inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>well that's pretty much it you can go<br>home now<br>everything's been said<br>um right thank you Joe that was lovely<br>Tina Koto Cortina<br>or te rohine<br>mama<br>I want to thank uh sorry I want to start<br>by thanking the university for giving me<br>this opportunity to reflect on my life<br>and career I've had some lovely times<br>looking back through our photo albums to<br>find photos to scan and thinking back<br>about research projects that I've done<br>and the interesting challenges and<br>successes and the people I've worked<br>with so it's been a really nice thing to<br>do<br>Kauai who am I or who am I from<br>the old guy on this photo is George<br>priest born in Ernst in the shetlands in<br>1825. he came out to New Zealand and<br>walked from Wellington to Hawke's Bay<br>with several of his adult sons to<br>Farmland which I just want to take a<br>moment to acknowledge was I assume taken<br>from gati kahununu<br>the young boy in front is my grandfather<br>here scene with his wife Annie my<br>grandmother who came to New Zealand from<br>Ireland and married him just before he<br>went off to fight in World War One<br>they had four children<br>very Dura Presbyterians that they appear<br>to be<br>uh<br>and the one the boy at the front of that<br>photo is my father Hugh<br>he grew up and went to Canterbury<br>University to study law where he<br>disappointed his parents by becoming<br>interested in Psychology and went on to<br>get a PhD and be an academic<br>these are my maternal grandparents Frank<br>and Kathleen Usher<br>um photographed in Bournemouth and their<br>English as far back as I know about<br>they had two children<br>My Mother Audrey and we won't like this<br>photo I know but I think it's really<br>cute<br>and her brother David and they<br>immigrated to New Zealand when my mother<br>was 13.<br>she went to Marsden Collegiate and then<br>University and did a ba going on to be a<br>secretary and disappointing her parents<br>by falling in love with and marrying<br>someone who wasn't wealthy had no<br>interest in being wealthy and was<br>opposed to private schooling<br>oh<br>later on when I went to University my<br>mother went back and did a law degree<br>working as a clerk for the high court<br>judges in Christchurch and for the<br>Inland Revenue Department for a number<br>three years after my parents married I<br>came along and then my sister Julia<br>I showed an early tendency to want to<br>look after sick teddy bears and to tell<br>in my first year at University I spotted<br>this rather gorgeous young man Hugh<br>Forsyth and three years later yes we<br>were very young we got married<br>um eight years after that the first of<br>our lovely children Ella arrived<br>she wasn't completely sure about how she<br>felt about the arrival of Izzy five<br>years later here in the arms of our very<br>good friend Joni<br>but five years after that when aloe came<br>along they were both apparently<br>delighted<br>just to bring us up to<br>speed up to the current day my sister<br>Julia did a botany degree and an MBA at<br>otago and is now a primary school<br>teacher in Sydney<br>this is my mother recently in her happy<br>place with our pets on the couch at home<br>and this is the priest Forsyth gang now<br>Arlo has just finished a botany degree<br>and is going to train as a high school<br>teacher Izzy is a professional<br>firefighter and Ella is an engineer who<br>is currently working doing covert<br>so why an epidemiological lens<br>well I wanted to honor my father in this<br>talk because he was the first influence<br>on my career path<br>he was a psychologist whose research<br>area was perception and I have some<br>lenses of his and one day at lunch my<br>friend Claire and I did a bit of<br>brainstorming and came up with this<br>title for my talk because I wanted to<br>have something nice as a prop in the<br>inevitable photo<br>as it turns out I used this rather than<br>the lenses as a prop I'm not sure what<br>it is actually but I think it's<br>something to do with demonstrating light<br>splitting or something but I thought it<br>was cool<br>this is my favorite photo of my father<br>friend to cats reading or snoozing after<br>dinner in the lounge of the house I grew<br>up in<br>he worked in the department of<br>psychology at the University of<br>Canterbury for nearly 20 years<br>he was a well-loved teacher and<br>published as far as I can tell four<br>peer-reviewed papers in his whole career<br>um<br>when I was in the fourth year of my<br>medical degree he dropped dead walking<br>one of his colleagues at his funeral<br>giving the eulogy said he was an analyst<br>who could strip things to the a bear<br>Essentials rapidly and with great<br>exactness<br>Hugh priest had many admirable qualities<br>but above all he was a family man the<br>achievements of his wife and daughters<br>were always on the tip of his tongue he<br>spoke of them often and with enormous<br>affection and pride in Hugh's life they<br>came first and he did not care who knew<br>it<br>as any of you who have had parents die<br>especially when you're relatively young<br>will know I still agree for him and I<br>mourn the fact that as I've grown up and<br>ended up taking a similar path to his<br>I've not been able to benefit from his<br>critical analytical abilities and<br>discuss things of mutual interest and<br>nor have I had his love or support to<br>lean on I do know that he would be proud<br>of me now but also always and I like to<br>think that I may have inherited some of<br>his admirable qualities<br>through encouraging me to use my brain<br>and pushing me to enter a profession so<br>that I wouldn't need to be dependent for<br>my livelihood on some men he probably<br>had the most important influence on my<br>so epidemiology I did have plans to<br>do these really cool ways of bringing<br>lenses and epidemiology in my life<br>altogether and it just got to kind of<br>contorted and cute so I abandoned all<br>that<br>but um for the rest of this talk I'm<br>going to say a bit about how I ended up<br>being an epidemiologist tell you about<br>some of the research I've done and<br>reflect a bit<br>I want to make the point right now that<br>I do research in teams and I'm not<br>always the principal investigator<br>and also that I don't have a kind of<br>thread that runs through my research<br>where I wanted to investigate something<br>and I did one study and then built on<br>that and built on that I've done lots of<br>different things<br>and I've done so many interesting<br>different things when I think about it<br>and I can't talk about all of them so<br>I've chosen a few which I think were<br>important in my trajectory to where I am<br>now if you have worked with me and I<br>don't include the study that you were<br>part of I'm really sorry I would have<br>loved to but please don't be offended<br>um teaching is also part of being a<br>professor and I'm not really talking<br>about teaching I had plans to but<br>yesterday morning I started with a talk<br>that was two hours long and I had to cut<br>a whole lot of stuff out and still<br>probably a bit long but anyway<br>um<br>when I started down here teaching I did<br>exactly what this blogger is talking<br>about I thought epidemiology people<br>might think it's a bit dry start with<br>something funny you know lift the mood<br>and go from there so I did Google<br>epidemiology jokes and I've never used<br>this one in a talk but I've always<br>laughs<br>um<br>I'm not going to teach you anything much<br>about epidemiology but I did just want<br>to say a word about what it is and thank<br>you Joe for um giving a definition of<br>Public Health just was that was not set<br>up but that was perfect it gives us this<br>context<br>um<br>and I was going to say something about<br>how we're all epidemiologists now but<br>David's done that for me<br>the definition the standard definition<br>of epidemiology is that it's the study<br>of the distribution and determinants of<br>diseases or health States in populations<br>and prospects for their control<br>um and it underpins it's the<br>quantitative underpinning of Public<br>Health<br>and so we use this slide in our<br>introductory lectures on public health<br>and epidemiology or I certainly do and<br>it's a completely unrealistic of course<br>representation of how we go about trying<br>to address public health problems it's<br>never as linear and beautifully staged<br>as that there's often lots of things<br>going on at once but broadly<br>epidemiology is understood in two parts<br>one is descriptive which was Where We<br>Are<br>identifying or having decided what the<br>public health problem we're talking<br>about is identifying who has it where<br>and when people talk about person place<br>and time and you've seen a lot of that<br>in the pandemic a lot of discussion of<br>who's who's getting it<br>um<br>the other the other sort of part of<br>epidemiology is analytic analytical<br>epidemiology where you're asking this<br>question broadly why do some people get<br>diseases and others don't<br>and that requires some very careful<br>design of sometimes quite sophisticated<br>studies and careful and sophisticated<br>analyzes and I really beg you if you're<br>not an epidemiologist to not try that at<br>home<br>there's been a bit of that going on as<br>well which has been perhaps less useful<br>so how did I end up being a professor of<br>epidemiology<br>I started off as PP and now I'm PPP<br>um<br>it's it's not as straightforward as that<br>and in fact nobody's life is as<br>straightforward as that and one of the<br>things I've really enjoyed getting older<br>especially as my children started<br>thinking about what they wanted to do<br>with their lives is realizing that so<br>many people who you meet who are doing<br>interesting things have not had a<br>straight line from when they left school<br>to where they get now it's never like<br>that<br>so I'm going to just try and Skip<br>through some of the bits along the way<br>I went to school in Christchurch as a<br>cedarhead university educated parents<br>oops<br>no there we go had a good group of<br>friends at school and I'm delighted that<br>two of these women Susan and Kerry are<br>here today I don't think we really<br>thought we were going to be movie stars<br>um<br>Kerry and I were prefects and koduxes at<br>Christchurch girls high school<br>and as I was getting<br>through my schooling and thinking about<br>what I wanted to do<br>um I was thinking about these things and<br>I don't think I articulated them very<br>well at the time to myself or anybody<br>else but I was strongly driven to want<br>to do good in the world and help people<br>and I really enjoyed solving problems<br>maths and physics were my strongest and<br>favorite subjects and that was that was<br>those were the things I think that I<br>needed out of a career<br>um<br>I thought I should just say that as I<br>was going through the photos I I just<br>came across photos of all these<br>interesting means of Transport that<br>we've had over the years so I've just<br>popped a few of them in the in the<br>slides so that you can entertain<br>yourself when what I'm saying isn't<br>interesting<br>um so<br>I you know I thought well medicine's<br>doing good in the world and help people<br>helping people<br>um I have to say it with absolutely no<br>disrespect to people in medicine who<br>solve challenging intellectual and<br>theoretical problems that was not part<br>of my thinking in terms of medicine I<br>was thinking it will be about doing good<br>in the world and helping people and that<br>um in the last my last year of school<br>I went on a trip to one of my friend's<br>family's Farm in ashburton and I was<br>taken by the really clever ways that<br>farmers solve problems technical<br>practical<br>and get things done around the place and<br>I just thought it was so cool some of<br>the really Nifty ways that they came up<br>with solving problems and I thought that<br>would be really cool to be involved in<br>doing that and I read around and<br>discovered there's this thing called<br>agricultural engineering and I thought<br>well that's going to sorry that's going<br>to um<br>work for my interests in physics and<br>maths and it will be doing good in the<br>world and helping people so I thought<br>maybe that's what I should do and I went<br>out to visit the course advisor at what<br>was then Lincoln College because it was<br>a course run between engineering and<br>Lincoln and he was slightly perplexed to<br>see me and essentially said well you<br>know the thing is that girls don't<br>really do this<br>um I was a bit of a bitable person at<br>that age I think I went back to the<br>careers advisor at school and said well<br>agricultural engineering isn't going to<br>work out<br>um what else do you suggest and she said<br>bright girls do medicine<br>and I said huh right<br>and I went and had a chat with my GP<br>about what it's like being a doctor and<br>trying to think about whether I would<br>want to be a doctor<br>and he said<br>it's really hard to get in you know<br>and so I acknowledge that's probably not<br>the ideal motivation but the other<br>motivations were still there in the<br>background<br>at that time you could get what was<br>called preferential entry to medical<br>school where you were guaranteed a place<br>you just had to do first year and do<br>whatever you like<br>I really regret that I wasted that<br>opportunity to do some really<br>interesting things like history and<br>philosophy and political science that I<br>could have done and I know I would have<br>really enjoyed but one thing I did do<br>was a psychology course<br>my father wouldn't allow me to do the<br>course which would enable me to go on<br>and do a major in Psychology because he<br>was the head of department at the time<br>and said if I wanted to study psychology<br>I'd have to go to a different University<br>and so I did the non-continuing course<br>which is where I spied that young man I<br>mentioned earlier on so that was worth<br>it<br>so in 1981 I came down to Dunedin for to<br>be a second year medical student and at<br>the time otago was facing a drop in<br>enrollments partly due to changes in the<br>government's support for students so the<br>marketing team put together a video<br>intended to encourage people to come to<br>otago and I'm just gonna oh no that's<br>okay not going to work<br>I thoroughly recommend looking up<br>learning is a way of life on YouTube<br>Hawken has digitized it it's fantastic<br>I'm there for about half a second but<br>also it shows Simon Hall where I went to<br>in my second year and this is me in my<br>preferred exam preparation position in<br>my little room in Summit Hall in second<br>year<br>and I'm showing it to you partly because<br>it's nostalgic for me and I like seeing<br>it and partly because<br>um<br>it was it was an important time for me<br>and my journey towards epidemiology<br>because<br>David skigg had just come back sorry I<br>ripped you a photo off the web somewhere<br>had just returned from Oxford and to be<br>the professor of preventive and social<br>medicine<br>and he taught us about epidemiology in<br>second year and I was just so taken with<br>it he talked about how you could figure<br>out what caused Disease by<br>observing and thinking and doing clever<br>studies without ever cutting anyone up<br>and looking at them under a microscope<br>and I just thought it was amazing and I<br>believe that David's enthusiasm and<br>communication skills were important in<br>the fact that<br>it doesn't show up very well does it<br>that um eight of our class went on to do<br>Public Health Medicine<br>so we have Lindley cook Peter Crampton<br>Jackie Fawcett Bernie Mullen<br>Leanne Parkin die North and that's me in<br>the corner and also ashiro kawachi who's<br>not in the photo so that was five<br>percent of our class going on to Public<br>Health Medicine and I looked it up the<br>other day that compares with less than<br>one percent of all New Zealand doctors<br>who are Public Health Medicine<br>Specialists so that is a little bit of<br>analytical epidemiology comparing a<br>group exposed to David Lilly teaching<br>and with everybody doesn't hold up as an<br>epidemiological study if you think about<br>it more than a second but<br>um the sky<br>David Murdock didn't do Public Health<br>Medicine but does have a masters in<br>epidemiology from the London School of<br>hygiene I'm not sure if we can credit<br>that to David or not David damskig<br>anyway<br>um<br>a few cars now uh<br>I went on to where am I I went on to do<br>my um so what we call clinical school<br>years in Christchurch and did my first<br>house surgeon year in Wellington nothing<br>epidemiological happened there so I'm<br>not going to um go on about that<br>and that was Christchurch that's<br>Wellington<br>um and then as so many of our peers were<br>able to do<br>Hugh and I went and did some overseas<br>experience<br>we cycled in Greece and Ireland and in<br>England<br>we bought a Combi van it's very<br>stereotypical and drove across Europe to<br>Turkey and around a bit of turkey and<br>for some of the way accompanied by my<br>mum<br>um and in between times I worked at a<br>number of a e departments in London as a<br>Locum and also at Westminster Hospital<br>which is um<br>not a hospital anymore<br>um<br>but I did a number of locums in<br>radiotherapy and oncology which actually<br>I really enjoyed but to train in that<br>would have taken a lot more years in a<br>hospital item like working in hospitals<br>so that was not going to happen<br>but also while I was at Westminster I<br>met a Public Health Medicine registrar<br>who talked to me about what public<br>health is the breadth of it and the way<br>that it tries to improve people's lives<br>by changing things at higher levels than<br>at the individual patient and I just<br>thought that was great I'd also been<br>very struck by when doing a e locums by<br>the extent to which failures of the<br>system like poor access to Primary Care<br>had such a big impact on people's health<br>and their lives and so I<br>um we came back to uh<br>New Zealand for me to train in public<br>health medicine I would thought that I<br>was going to go and um<br>run the Health Service better that was<br>my original intention<br>um about eight months before we left we<br>and then we came back and Ella was able<br>to spend some time with her grandmothers<br>excuse mum was living in Auckland<br>and I set off on this Public Health<br>Medicine training the first part of<br>which<br>is a masters in public health with a<br>um Robert beaglehold taught me<br>epidemiology and he was at a point in<br>his life and career where he was doing a<br>lot of kind of thinking about not just<br>what epidemiology is and how you can<br>best use it but what is public health<br>where does it fit in<br>um what are we doing is it good and I'd<br>love to those conversations and<br>realized I guess that epidemiology was<br>really what I wanted to do and that it<br>would combine doing good in the world<br>and helping people and solving<br>interesting problems<br>um<br>Robert beagle hole I I really love the<br>methods I wanted to be a methodologist<br>but Robert bigelhold said no one will<br>take you seriously as an epidemiologist<br>unless you are first a world expert in a<br>particular<br>area of Health<br>from an epidemiological point of view so<br>you've got to find a disease you want to<br>study so I went<br>because I'm inclined to do it seems<br>anyway my masters were supervised by Rod<br>Jackson who's had a bit of a profile<br>over covert<br>uh and I was the coordinator of a large<br>descriptive study of cardiovascular risk<br>factors in the Auckland population so<br>looking at who had for example high<br>blood pressure uh over what period and<br>where<br>when we came back to New Zealand from<br>the UK Hugh and I had a bit of a deal<br>that if he didn't find good work such as<br>it had in London by the time I finished<br>my training we'd go back to the UK and<br>that indeed is what happened I looked<br>around for a way of us getting back<br>there without it costing the fortune<br>that we didn't happen to have on hand<br>and found a scholarship that I could<br>apply for and I was<br>I got this Oxford nuffield medical<br>Fellowship<br>we had is he we couldn't go to Oxford<br>shortly after she was born because they<br>wouldn't let me go and study part-time<br>while she was very small we had to wait<br>for a year before we were allowed to go<br>but off we went we went without a PhD<br>topic I didn't have a PhD topic I looked<br>around for one it turns out that in<br>Oxford people are very busy and unless<br>there's something about you that's<br>special it's very hard to get people's<br>attention<br>being a<br>qualified medical specialist fully<br>funded was not special enough and it<br>took me a long time to find a PhD topic<br>and eventually someone pointed out to me<br>that there was a New Zealander in our<br>College who was a doctor and I chatted<br>to him and he said oh I know an<br>epidemiologist<br>and sent me off to see Roy Anderson who<br>was not an epidemiologist in the way<br>that I had ever heard of it he's a<br>mathematical modeler of infectious<br>diseases but he was doing a big project<br>on antibiotic resistance and he had some<br>mathematicians and physicists who were<br>working on a big database of general<br>practice records but none of them were<br>quite sure which of the drugs were<br>antibiotics in that big database and I<br>came along and said oh I'm a doctor<br>so I ended up<br>being supervised by Roy and my advice to<br>people thinking about a PhD is to find a<br>supervisor who cares about you and your<br>project and is not too busy to actually<br>see you and help you along with it it<br>wasn't a it wasn't a terribly<br>satisfactory supervision experience and<br>then I'd so I've decided I had to find<br>something I could do without help and<br>decided to do a study using routinely<br>eclipse data which then I discovered<br>that it's really hard in England to get<br>people to respond to your letters asking<br>about their data if there's not<br>something special about you and they<br>don't already know you but as it happens<br>Roy left<br>um Oxford while I was there and I got a<br>new supervisor David meant who was<br>co-trained in public health and primary<br>care and who<br>got on the phone to some of his mates<br>and said how about giving this woman<br>some of your data and suddenly I had all<br>the data I needed<br>um David really got me through and I'm<br>so grateful for that he was very good at<br>saying stop this chapter is good enough<br>and that was very important<br>um so this is the project that I did I'm<br>not going to talk at length about any of<br>my research just very quick and high<br>level<br>um sorry I'm probably going to be too<br>long<br>um<br>but I was interested in whether<br>um<br>antibiotic taking of the people in your<br>community was important for your risk of<br>getting antibiotic resist resistant<br>infections because there's a lot of<br>focus on individuals taking antibiotics<br>and then then getting resistant<br>infections but actually if you think<br>about it it's the people who are<br>coughing on you or whatever infecting<br>you it's probably their antibiotic<br>taking that's important so that's what I<br>was interested in I did a I got you<br>wouldn't believe how much data and how<br>long it took me to clean it and make it<br>analyzable it seems like I can't believe<br>how long it took but it did take a long<br>time and<br>I've got a number of analyzes that look<br>a bit like this which is looking on the<br>x-axis at this one's General practices<br>and the amount of prescribing of a<br>particular antibiotic and this is the<br>resistance of particular bugs that came<br>from those practices and you can see<br>there's actually very little there's no<br>relationship really<br>and this is when you make group them<br>into bigger bigger geographical groups<br>which I hoped might better represent the<br>community people live and work in<br>there's you know the slightly less<br>scatter but there's a lot less data so<br>really<br>my conclusion was that in in the UK at<br>that time the focus on trying to get GPS<br>to stop prescribing as many antibiotics<br>was not going to deliver us reductions<br>in antibiotic resistance that people<br>I was born relatively soon before we<br>came back to<br>uh New Zealand<br>um so I was going to say after doing<br>this study I felt like I could call<br>myself an epidemiologist<br>we came back home after this initially<br>to Auckland where it was made clear that<br>no one there really thought there was<br>any particular point in infectious<br>disease epidemiology and I didn't do<br>much research there although I did work<br>on the cervical cancer audit which was<br>looking at the screening program and how<br>well it was doing where I met Sue<br>Kringle who I believe is either online<br>or is going to watch this later and<br>who's now down here and that was great<br>then at the end of 2005 I came down to<br>otago where I am forever grateful for<br>the very collegial welcome I received<br>and I really felt when I was here that<br>if I was doing working well doing my<br>best that I would be valued and it<br>wasn't necessary to be bringing in<br>multi-million dollar grants every week<br>before anyone would think that you were<br>okay and that was a relief and really<br>good<br>shortly after I got here I was invited<br>to a meeting organized by Michael Baker<br>um<br>sorry<br>um it's all right<br>um uh where he was bringing together a<br>bunch of people doing infectious disease<br>research at otago most of them not<br>epidemiologists<br>and he was getting together<br>um as he's so good at several groups of<br>people to propose projects for a big<br>funding stream from CDC in the UK in the<br>US<br>uh and Lance Jennings and I put together<br>the<br>um application for this study trying to<br>see whether screening people for<br>symptoms as they came into the country<br>would keep a pandemic influenza out so<br>there was a lot of concern about a new<br>pandemic and this was around 2007.<br>um Aleister Duncan there was our um our<br>very well organized and enthusiastic<br>study coordinator who also did his<br>Masters<br>we had a big team and one of the team on<br>the days when flights were coming into<br>and then out of Christchurch from<br>Australia would head down to the airport<br>at about four o'clock in the morning and<br>hand over a pack of these questionnaires<br>which were designed to be the same size<br>as an arrivals card to the air crew who<br>would then hand them out on the flight<br>back to New Zealand and as people<br>arrived into Christchurch they would see<br>these notices and have our lovely<br>research assistants asking them to give<br>their questionnaires back<br>and as they gave them back the research<br>assistants checked whether they had<br>ticked any of the boxes for symptoms and<br>whether they had a particularly Mark a<br>particular marked card and if you had<br>the mark there was a random selection of<br>cards to Mark if you had a market card<br>or you had symptoms you are invited to<br>come and have a have some measurements<br>taken in this little corner of the<br>arrivals Hall<br>had the temperature taken had a swab for<br>a period we were doing thermal scanning<br>and we got questionnaires back from<br>about nearly 16 000 Travelers which was<br>68 of the people arriving through at<br>that time<br>17 reported at least one symptom<br>although<br>um the uh the the prevalence of<br>so-called influenza like illness was<br>which was much tighter was lower than<br>that<br>we got about 3 800 respiratory specimens<br>um and estimated that the prevalence of<br>influenza among those arriving Travelers<br>our conclusion was that and this is kind<br>of interesting in the light of well I<br>think it's interesting in the life of<br>recent events<br>um we concluded that screening for<br>symptoms to keep influenza out of New<br>Zealand was not going to be worthwhile<br>you would you would end up having to<br>take swabs and ask to quarantine a very<br>large number of people<br>and yet most of the people who actually<br>had influenza up their noses were not<br>would not have been picked up so we<br>decided it wasn't going to be a useful<br>strategy<br>obviously this was influenza and this<br>influenza in particular<br>I went on to do the study that Joe<br>mentioned about hand sanitizer in<br>primary schools where we found that we<br>randomized 68 primary schools and got<br>them to get the kids to use hand<br>sanitizer on the way out to lunch and<br>play it did not reduce<br>winter illness absences which was what<br>we'd been hoping it would do but I was<br>sitting in my office one day when the<br>phone rang and it was someone who I had<br>seen only occasionally since medical<br>school who said<br>we're going to do a trial of vitamin D<br>in respiratory illness do you want to be<br>part of it<br>and I see it's quite as David mentioned<br>it's quite isolated being an infectious<br>disease epidemiologist in New Zealand<br>there aren't that many of us and<br>um yeah I thought this is great<br>um and I said yes and we did this study<br>on vitamin D supplementation and<br>respiratory infections<br>with all due respect to everyone<br>involved this wasn't the most<br>methodologically interesting study I've<br>been involved in it was an individually<br>randomized controlled trial it was a lot<br>of work to make it happen<br>um it was in the context of a big<br>vitamin D research industry taking off<br>um finding or claiming that vitamin D<br>would cure or prevent almost anything so<br>it was really useful to be able to find<br>that in otherwise healthy adults<br>vitamins up D supplementation did not<br>reduce<br>winter respiratory infections but what<br>the study really did was to link me up<br>with a multi-disciplinary team who<br>worked on infectious diseases<br>and that was that has enabled me to<br>continue to be an infectious disease<br>epidemiologist so this is the team from<br>that study<br>but I went on to work with members of<br>the team on Legionnaires disease where<br>we found that keeping compost away from<br>your face is really important and that<br>there's a lot more Legionnaires disease<br>out there than we previously thought<br>with Steve Chambers on<br>leprosy in the Pacific<br>including a really interesting modeling<br>study done by Charlotte gilkerson a<br>really great Master student<br>and as I say it it having that<br>connection with a group of people to<br>work with made it possible for me to<br>continue to do what I wanted to do and<br>it led on to this group one Health RTA<br>row which includes environment animal<br>and human health people<br>um Nigel French is a Veterinary<br>epidemiologist and um I've really<br>uh<br>just a brief note about being the chief<br>clinical advisor epidemiology at the<br>Ministry of Health this is not part of<br>my academic career but it was made<br>possible by being an infectious disease<br>epidemiologist and it was so interesting<br>and so useful and I really do think that<br>people who are academics and Public<br>Health<br>should spend time working in the places<br>where their research is being used to<br>wait policy or research in the area is<br>being used to make policy to see how<br>it's done to meet the people who do it<br>and to try to help<br>my role was a lot of it was working with<br>modelers<br>trying to explain what the models meant<br>to the decision makers in the ministry<br>and elsewhere trying to help the<br>modelers understand what the questions<br>the ministry wanted to ask really were<br>um reviewing and commenting on the<br>reports a bit of managing expectations<br>as this kind of magical thinking that's<br>grown up around modeling that modeling<br>can answer all of our questions and that<br>whatever modeling says is the answer to<br>our questions and the modelers know that<br>neither of those things are true but it<br>requires a bit of um a bit of uh yes<br>management of expectations among some of<br>the people wanting to use them<br>um what one of the reasons for just<br>mentioning this is that I was part of a<br>modeling Steering group which was a<br>multi-agency group including treasury<br>States New Zealand Department of prime<br>minister and cabinet health and the<br>modelers themselves<br>uh and we had we met very frequently by<br>zoom and actually this was one one of<br>the most intellectually stimulating<br>experiences I've had for a really long<br>time was a group of people all<br>enthusiastic<br>um interested nutting things out having<br>robust discussions about what was going<br>on what needed to go on and it was<br>really fabulous I I'm really glad that I<br>did that<br>the final study that I'm going to talk<br>about is um<br>is one that's also already been<br>mentioned which<br>is the study of socks over shoes to<br>prevent you from sliding on the ice<br>so you may or may not know that many um<br>possibly most health researchers have a<br>secret ambition to get into the British<br>medical journal Christmas edition where<br>the British medical journal publishes<br>methodologically sound studies on<br>slightly unusual topics that they're<br>they don't usually publish on and<br>they're often slightly humorous and so<br>one day in the Tea Room in preventing<br>social medicine after there'd been some<br>suggestion by the council that people<br>should put socks on over their shoes to<br>stop them slipping<br>um a group of us thought we could do a<br>study of that and try and get into the<br>Christmas bmj and so we did a study<br>which we randomized people at the top of<br>an icy slope to have socks on over their<br>shoes or not and we collected<br>information at the bottom about how<br>slippery they had found it and we<br>watched to see if they fell over<br>and we found that indeed putting socks<br>on over your shoes does prevent you<br>slipping down I see paths<br>um<br>and we were too late for the Christmas<br>BMG bmj they have a really early closing<br>date<br>but we published it in the New Zealand<br>medical journal and rather than the joy<br>of a Christmas bmj we were we received<br>the ignoble prize for physics<br>in 2010 so the ignobel prizes are prizes<br>for research that makes you laugh and<br>then makes you think<br>and better than the Christmas bmj we got<br>a photo of Leanne in a photo of my feet<br>with socks on over my shoes in the bmj<br>that year<br>so that was cool oh here's a picture of<br>Sheila who was the other key um the fire<br>statistician who was the other key<br>member of the team<br>um so I just want to come back to this<br>business of how I ended up as a<br>professor of epidemiology<br>and just to show you that that wiggly<br>line I um showed you was me trying to<br>trace the um travel that I've done as<br>part of becoming a professor of<br>epidemiology and this is just uh<br>um this is a uh illustration<br>of<br>how incredibly I was might say lucky but<br>I'm going to say privileged I've been to<br>have this journey towards being a<br>professor of epidemiology and I'm going<br>to show you I don't think this is going<br>to work I've tried so many ways to do<br>this I can't tell you um clever<br>epidemiological bios statistical ways to<br>show this but I'm going to show the<br>switches which is a graphic of the<br>relationship between a whole lot of<br>different<br>um<br>uh things and and then these are used<br>when you're trying to work out about<br>causing causation of disease and there's<br>lots of components and you're trying to<br>go well this is important but it's also<br>related to that which is related to this<br>and that's related to the outcome and<br>this is related to the outcome and you<br>draw this up and then there are ways of<br>figuring out from there how the analysis<br>should be done to take into account<br>things that might affect the<br>relationship between the exposure and<br>the outcome but without putting too many<br>of them in your statistical model so I<br>tried to do this for things that I<br>thought affected me<br>in my journey to becoming a professor<br>and<br>when you read stories about people who<br>are successful you often hear about you<br>might hear about them being very clever<br>you might hear about them having<br>supportive mentors achieving a lot<br>having an excellent education working<br>hard and all those things you know<br>pertain<br>um<br>you may hear about their parents and<br>obviously you know I had tertiary<br>educated parents you don't necessarily<br>hear about some of the other things and<br>so I've put up the top there tried to<br>encapsulate underprivileged all of the<br>things that I have had because I am a<br>middle class pakija New Zealander<br>growing up in Christchurch<br>you know I got to go to Great Schools<br>because that's who I was there are ways<br>in which my um education and<br>achievements uh because that's who I was<br>you know the just you know my initial<br>period in Oxford was really hard but<br>what solved it it was a link that I had<br>with somebody that I wouldn't have had<br>if I wasn't me<br>um and so I just want to acknowledge<br>that I'm I'm happy I'm happy with my<br>achievements I'm I'm happy with<br>um with where I've got to<br>um I'm proud of myself but I'm also very<br>aware that it's not just me and that the<br>kind of society that I would like to<br>live in does not<br>privilege people because of who they are<br>when they're born<br>it's public health kind of anyway<br>um<br>just almost really almost finished I've<br>added to my list of things I want to do<br>do good in the world and help people<br>solve challenging problems and work with<br>people I like working with and that's<br>been increasingly um a focus for me and<br>I absolutely recommend it as a way of<br>choosing the things that you do<br>so I've learned that individual mentors<br>and supporters open doors and that's<br>great but it also perpetuates<br>um<br>the networks that we have of people who<br>look after each other and that's a<br>problem if you want to have a truly<br>equal Society<br>um I've learned that an environment that<br>facilitates successful team building is<br>one that I want to be in and that in<br>public health Epi research relationships<br>broad relationships are absolutely<br>crucial<br>I went to University at a time where I<br>didn't pay fees and I got allowances<br>from the government and I'm incredibly<br>grateful for that<br>um I am grateful that I was funded by<br>the public health medicine training<br>program to train in public health<br>medicine and that the nuffield<br>foundation funded my default at Oxford<br>but a couple of<br>um sort of standard slides for<br>acknowledgments for those two studies<br>that I mentioned<br>and I want to finish<br>with these pictures of people I haven't<br>mentioned but have been important in my<br>academic Journey they're roughly ordered<br>by when I first met them sort of they<br>are co-researchers they're supporters<br>and mentors and their friends<br>I have a whole lot of other people<br>who've been important in my life and I<br>could have gone on believe me to tell<br>you the really interesting stories about<br>all those people but I've tried to<br>restrict myself here to the ones who've<br>been important particularly to my<br>academic Journey<br>so in summary I've not been driven by<br>following a passion to do a particular<br>thing<br>I've probably been influenced<br>been too influenced by advice from<br>people early on in the in the journey<br>I'm happy where I got to but<br>agricultural engineering would have been<br>kind of cool as well<br>um I'm not particularly focused I've<br>done work on lots of different things<br>and that's cool I've actually done a lot<br>of studies which have had null findings<br>in other words found no effect of the<br>exposure or the intervention on the<br>outcome and that's good it's good to<br>know when things don't work especially<br>in the context of people pushing them<br>um<br>I've made choices based on things that<br>looked interesting and as I said<br>increasingly on who I want to work with<br>I'm not going to get a national research<br>medal or teaching award but I've had an<br>interesting career and I've really<br>enjoyed it and I look forward to<br>continuing to enjoy it for<br>um<br>and as yet undetermined amount of time<br>yeah<br>well Akira Koto um for somebody who<br>promised to deliver a very long leak so<br>that was actually remarkably to time<br>Frisch so um uh thank you<br>um my name is Neil gimmel I'm the acting<br>Deputy Pro Vice Chancellor Health<br>Sciences it's quite the mouthful and<br>it's actually a very humbling<br>um job I have which is to thank Trish<br>for her insightful lecture and I want to<br>touch on a number of points that she has<br>raised this evening<br>first<br>I just want to say that third time's the<br>charm I believe I felt I had to get a<br>cliche in there somewhere<br>and I'm so glad that you've had it now<br>because I get to make this um this vote<br>of thanks<br>um so that was a very well delivered<br>insightful lecture with a very good<br>sense of humor Plus for me as a car<br>Aficionado I now recognize that you're a<br>Citroen lover and seemed to have<br>collected many many of them over the<br>years I've been thinking you probably<br>wish you still had them because they're<br>now worth a fortune<br>um you still got one oh well that's good<br>to know can I borrow it<br>um anyway uh the cars cars aside<br>um I just wanted to reflect<br>that as a public health expert and<br>epidemiologist you've delivered a lot of<br>good to the world<br>and I want to also acknowledge that<br>sometimes that good comes in the shape<br>of knowing what doesn't work because<br>that's incredibly important as we go<br>forward and try to find interventions<br>that do<br>and avoid us wasting time on<br>interventions that don't you know things<br>like trying to inject bleach that sort<br>of thing not to be recommended<br>uh<br>I as a geneticist was intrigued by some<br>of the things that you drew parallels<br>with because I've worked on some of<br>these things too it turns out antibiotic<br>resistance which is important<br>influenza which of course<br>a decade ago or so we thought was<br>probably going to be the next pandemic<br>it could well be the pandemic after this<br>one sorry to be the Doom and Gloom<br>Merchant and I remember working on swine<br>flu and bird flu at the time which I'm<br>sure that's what you were doing and I<br>think I'm fairly sure probably quite a<br>few of us were participants in your<br>study at some juncture around about<br>2007-2008 I seem to recall that also<br>seemed to recall being terrified of<br>going through Hong Kong where they would<br>stick a thing in your ear and I thought<br>oh God I'm going to get stuck here or<br>something like that at some point but<br>fortunately it never happened but thank<br>you very much for that really important<br>Public Health work which has helped keep<br>us better and safer<br>um I don't know if you're involved with<br>the flu tracking project but that's<br>religiously undertaken in my family<br>every Monday morning and that's a really<br>important piece of work too so those<br>sorts of data I think are interesting I<br>do recall as I first arrived at otago<br>the socks and slips study that you were<br>involved with I can a vouch that does<br>work and occasionally I probably should<br>have used it more frequently than I have<br>indeed at times I've about six weeks ago<br>I had a really bad slip if I've been<br>wearing socks over my shoes I think that<br>may not have happened hindsight's 2020.<br>you said at the beginning of your<br>lecture and towards the end that you<br>wanted to do good in world and help<br>people and you have<br>very much so what you didn't really<br>cover very much is how you have helped<br>others uh through their academic<br>Journeys as a teacher mentor and leader<br>and that's something that I think we<br>want to acknowledge here at the<br>University of otago you also mentioned<br>that your father had enormous affection<br>and pride for you and your family and<br>I'm sorry that he is not with us this<br>evening and I acknowledge the hurt that<br>that will that you'll feel<br>but we have enormous affection and pride<br>for you Trish at the University of otago<br>and as your extended academic whanau we<br>just want to wish you all the very best<br>for this important moment in your life<br>and we're very grateful to be able to<br>share it with you<br>I'll draw to a close now and ask you to<br>join with me and thanking Trish for an<br>inspiring lecture<br>I do have<br>yes I do have a small gift to partake to<br>all right<br>almost done<br>so the last job I have this evening is<br>to invite you all to join with us to<br>celebrate further with Trish uh over<br>drinks and snacks at the staff Club<br>I look forward to seeing you there thank<br>you<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
