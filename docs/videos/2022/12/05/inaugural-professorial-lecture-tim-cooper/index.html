trabalka who's going to<br>foreign<br>it's a real privilege tonight to<br>introduce my colleague Professor Tim<br>Cooper for his inaugural professorial<br>lecture<br>Tim completed his PhD from the<br>University of Canterbury in 1998.<br>he worked as a clerk of the social<br>services Select Committee in the New<br>Zealand Parliament for two years<br>and was then pastor of a church in Upper<br>Hutt<br>he joined the Department of Theology and<br>religious studies here at otago in 2005.<br>Tim is a historian of the 17th century<br>English religious and intellectual<br>history<br>he

has a particular focus on the<br>Puritans and two Puritans in particular<br>Richard Baxter and John Owen<br>Tim has written three books in this area<br>all with excellent publishers<br>he's pioneered an approach to Puritan<br>intellectual history that emphasizes<br>real world factors that shape ideas<br>factors such as personality experience<br>and geography he sees these Puritans as<br>real human beings influenced by a range<br>of factors rather than a set of walking<br>ideas<br>he has written one book on the way in<br>which the English Civil War prompted<br>Baxter to reinvent his doctrine of<br>salvation<br>and another on the strained relationship<br>between Baxter and Owen two most<br>significant Leaders with an English<br>non-conformity<br>his third publication is actually in<br>five volumes<br>it's a new scholarly edition of The<br>Autobiography of Richard Baxter Tim was<br>one of four co-editors of this massive<br>work it was published by Oxford<br>University press and as 3 000

the book is under contract to<br>Oxford University press<br>let me quite some words about Tim's work<br>written by Professor Crawford gribben of<br>Queen's University Belfast<br>he writes Tim Cooper's book John Owen<br>Richard Baxter and the formation of<br>non-conformity made a significant<br>Advance on the existing literature by<br>documenting particular aspects of Owen's<br>life over a dozen or more years<br>Cooper's outstanding discussion was<br>sensitive to psychological as well as<br>cultural and Theological factors and<br>open up opened up an important new<br>approach to Owen's life<br>for as Mark Burton properly noted in his<br>review Cooper's work was unquestionably<br>the most important study of Owen to have<br>appeared ever in print<br>great praise Professor gribbon goes on<br>to say that his current work on John<br>Owen and I quote follows Cooper in<br>developing social and biographical<br>contexts in an account of historical<br>theology<br>Tim's also written numerous articles in<br>book chapters these range in focus from<br>articles on Richard Baxter to the 16th<br>century English separatists use of<br>biblical authority to the emergence of<br>congregationalism and to the decline of<br>Calvinism amongst 17th century English<br>Puritans<br>notably he's had three articles<br>published in the Journal of<br>ecclesiastical history the premier<br>church history Journal published by<br>Cambridge University press<br>his research has also had a significant<br>popular impact with two abridgements of<br>Baxter's work right here in front

Koto itaimai Tata<br>now my guitarne Coho mataranga<br>okay<br>oh<br>kahori tinatato katoa<br>good evening greetings and welcome to<br>you all I acknowledge the Mana and<br>presence of everyone in this room<br>gathered here for a very special<br>occasion thank you<br>greetings also to the Mana fenua of this<br>beautiful place<br>my name is Tim and<br>I was<br>23 when I first encountered Richard<br>Baxter<br>and as you can tell from that photo<br>it was the end of 1993 and I had<br>finished my honors degree at the<br>University of Canterbury and I loved<br>history I loved history and I just<br>wanted to carry on<br>so I wanted to do a PhD and and I was<br>interested in what is called the<br>Protestant Reformation so I went along<br>to see the lecturer who might supervise<br>a PhD in the Protestant Reformation and<br>this was Glenn Burgess who is now at the<br>University of Hull in the UK<br>and clean head on his shelf nine<br>microfilm reels of the unpublished<br>letters and papers of Richard Baxter<br>and I recall him just pointing over to<br>his shelf and saying well what about<br>Richard Baxter<br>well what about Richard Baxter so let me<br>tell you a little bit about him he was<br>born in 1615 and he died in 1691 so he<br>lived across the span of the 17th<br>century and in English hitch history<br>that was a tumultuous and decisive<br>century<br>he was born and brought up and lived in<br>what are called the Midlands which uh<br>towards the border with Wales<br>and he became a very important religious<br>leader and even at times a key player in<br>negotiations at the highest level<br>he was the author in his life of around<br>140 books<br>just ponder that for a moment 140 books<br>some of them very very long<br>uh he became famous on a national level<br>for his pastoral Ministry a new model of<br>pastoral Ministry pioneered at his<br>Parish of kidderminster in<br>Worcestershire<br>and he had an enormous and productive<br>output<br>he left behind among those books a very<br>long autobiography that is an important<br>source for 17th century English History<br>he also left behind numerous unpublished<br>manuscripts and over 1200 letters either<br>to or from him and that was very<br>important for a PhD because I needed to<br>have access to a large body of material<br>from the distance of New Zealand<br>so Glenn pointed to those microfilm<br>reels and said what about Richard Baxter<br>so I went off and read his entry in what<br>is called the dictionary of national<br>biography and I thought well why not<br>I had I had no idea I had no idea what I<br>was doing I had no idea what I was<br>taking on perhaps if I'd paid attention<br>to nine microfilm reels of unpublished<br>papers I might have worked out what was<br>ahead of me<br>uh but naivety is I have to say an<br>underrated commodity we we do things<br>that we would never do if we really knew<br>um but there are you know there are two<br>things that I really really appreciate<br>about Richard Baxter and and the first<br>of them you've already got a sense of he<br>never shuts up<br>if if there is something to say he will<br>say it and what what what I so admire<br>and appreciate uh perhaps in person less<br>so but from a distance and as a<br>historian<br>he he's he gives himself away<br>he he constantly injects his personality<br>his life into his writings and he gives<br>you everything you need to work with uh<br>to understand he's he's a very personal<br>writer and I find that very appealing<br>so Richard Baxter was a fantastic choice<br>for which I can take absolutely zero<br>credit because I I really did not have<br>any clue<br>but off I wait<br>so I was working in the history of ideas<br>and in studying 17th century English<br>History that means working with<br>Christian ideas with Christian Theology<br>and I became quite interested in what is<br>known as soteriology the doctrine of<br>salvation and perhaps you can tell that<br>at this point we could easily drown in<br>some complex Waters so let's just try<br>and sail across the surface the key<br>question of soteriology is how as a<br>human person put in right relationship<br>with God when their sin and sinfulness<br>is an affront to a holy God<br>how does the human being find Salvation<br>and there are various<br>answers to that question and there was<br>one particular answer that Richard<br>Baxter deeply disliked in fact it's not<br>going uh too far to say that he was<br>obsessed<br>with<br>into nominism<br>so antinomianism comes it's it's a it's<br>an insult it's a label it comes from the<br>idea of being against the law<br>nomos is Greek for law<br>and that's a little bit of a red herring<br>the key point about the antinomians<br>comes to the it's the question of in the<br>process of Salvation how much do we do<br>and how much does God do and for the<br>antinomians God does everything and we<br>are simply passive in the process of<br>Salvation it is God who elects us and<br>chooses us to Salvation and brings about<br>our salvation and we are merely passive<br>in the process of salvation<br>well you might be able to pick up the<br>obvious objection to that Doctrine and<br>that is if it doesn't matter what we do<br>then we can live as we like<br>and Richard Baxter<br>did not like this Doctrine I noticed<br>this and so the key question animating<br>my PhD was this why was Baxter obsessed<br>with antinomianism<br>why I mean there are reasons to object<br>to the doctrine but he was obsessed he<br>didn't stop going on about it<br>so I try to understand why that was<br>and there's a long answer to that<br>question there's a whole book on it if<br>you want to read it<br>um<br>but let me give you the two main<br>dimensions<br>fear and personality<br>so first of all let's start off with<br>Baxter had an obsessive personality<br>he was like a dog with a bone he he was<br>a very disputatious dog with a bone<br>which which is ironic it really is<br>because his deepest<br>sincerest wish<br>was to bring about peace and unity in a<br>divided England<br>this is what he said<br>I am resolved to speak for peace while I<br>have a tongue to speak<br>and to write for peace while I have a<br>hand to write and to live to the<br>church's peace while I have an hour to<br>live and I'm able to do anything that<br>may promote it and he he meant that<br>he he did he deeply deeply desired peace<br>the problem was<br>that he lacked any sort of political<br>facility<br>and and he had a a personality that kept<br>on getting in the way of that aim<br>so to quote him in his own words I<br>confess I am strongly provoked to blab<br>out anything that I do confidently think<br>and he did<br>uh it is it is astonishing to see the<br>many people who admired Baxter and for<br>many people who really did not<br>uh that he attracted a huge number of<br>critics in his own lifetime<br>and he<br>in trying to end controversy<br>he managed to sustain it and provoke it<br>constantly throughout his life always<br>involved in controversy which helps to<br>account for an awful lot of those 140<br>books<br>I came across a series of correspondence<br>with a man called Edward Nicholson a<br>younger guy younger Minister and and in<br>the end the guy was so frustrated he<br>said private debates with you are<br>endless<br>I pray God this controversy be not here<br>I I just I this is the second thing that<br>I love about Baxter I love to watch him<br>from a distance to see his deep heart<br>for peace and unity and then to see him<br>tripping over his own personality again<br>and again and again and again it's just<br>it's so deeply deeply human<br>so the the first answer is to why Baxter<br>obsessed over antinomianism is that well<br>it's just his personality right he<br>doesn't give up that's one reason<br>but it's also a matter of fear<br>and here I need to tell you just briefly<br>about the English Civil War<br>there was an English Civil War from yeah<br>it's about all you need to know but just<br>1642-1646 the forces of parliament<br>against the forces of the Crown King<br>Charles the first<br>now the the really interesting thing is<br>that Baxter was intimately tied up and<br>very proximate throughout the whole<br>course of that war in fact the first<br>little we anecdote I'm going to give you<br>still astonishes me all these years on<br>the<br>oh I missed I missed woolly lemon I<br>can't I can't miss that I I love this<br>quote from him Willie was a great Baxter<br>scholar and an examiner of my PhD the<br>Pathos and Baxter's career is the gap<br>between Magnum and his name and divisive<br>means uh you know that that that sums it<br>up nicely that's his personality okay so<br>I was going to tell you about<br>um the first physical Skirmish of the<br>war before any battle was fought was an<br>ambush<br>a parliamentary forces were crossing<br>powick bridge and on the other side they<br>were pounced upon by royalists and they<br>went fleeing<br>now an ambush is by definition unplanned<br>right and and a surprise but lo and<br>behold there was one person on hand to<br>watch and it was Richard Baxter I I<br>still I mean the chances are<br>astronomical really uh of of anyone<br>watching that and and of all the people<br>in Britain alive at the time it's my guy<br>it's Richard so he he sees this first<br>Skirmish he sees this and then exactly a<br>month later it's Sunday morning and he's<br>preaching in a village called Ulster and<br>and everyone in the church can hear the<br>Canon fire of the first battle of the<br>war at Edge Hill right they can hear the<br>cannon fire and of course Baxter just<br>keeps on preaching but the next day he<br>goes to visit the site of the battle and<br>there across the field are a thousand<br>dead bodies<br>and just you know think for a moment<br>about the impact of that site in a<br>country that has not seen physical<br>violence on that scale for a long long<br>time<br>well Baxter uh was also on hand a couple<br>of years later at the Battle of nasby he<br>went to visit some friends and he was<br>appalled to find that they had been<br>corrupted by bad Doctrine<br>they had been corrupted by antinomianism<br>he was so<br>um so appalled at what they were doing<br>not necessarily by their ideas because<br>as I'm about to illustrate for you at<br>this at this time he sort of shared<br>their ideas but he could see what they<br>were doing with those ideas and that<br>worried him so he joined the army as a<br>Chaplain to try and counteract this bad<br>Doctrine<br>and he spent the next couple of years in<br>the Army uh following it around as a<br>Chaplain at the last major battles and<br>sieges in the mopping up campaign at the<br>beginning of uh 1647 in the middle of<br>the winter his nose started to bleed<br>and the medical wisdom of the day is<br>that you have too much blood so he<br>opened four veins<br>and the loss of blood very nearly killed<br>him certainly ended his army career in<br>the moment in the course of his<br>recuperation he had what you might call<br>a conversion moment<br>and uh he he totally changed<br>his soteriology<br>now<br>um I was trying to Grapple with this and<br>there was<br>there was one moment one of those<br>one of those rare and glorious moments<br>of scholarly inspiration that struck me<br>as I was working through Baxter's<br>correspondence this is I'm going to show<br>you I'm going to read you a quote from<br>it's the conclusion of a long letter to<br>another Minister John Warren written by<br>Baxter in 1657 51 forgive me<br>um let me read it to you oh that's Edge<br>Hill that gives you the idea well<br>actually I don't know if that's idgel<br>that's a battle in the Civil War<br>here it is I'm going to read this<br>um and then I'll try and explain it<br>to conclude<br>other ages have but heard of antinomian<br>doctrines but not seen what practical<br>birth they have travaled with as we have<br>done<br>that hath brought forth before our eyes<br>those antinomian practices that do fully<br>convince us that the actors do not take<br>sincere obedience to be any condition of<br>their Absolution or salvation right we<br>don't have to do anything we enter no<br>means seed<br>nor the receiving of Christ as Christ<br>that is as their King and Lord right<br>because if there's no law there's no<br>King to be justifying faith nor to be a<br>novice legislator a new legislator nor<br>his gospel or Covenant to be a law<br>either to guide or judge them the groans<br>tears and Blood Of The Godly the scorns<br>of the ungodly the sorrow of our friends<br>the derision of our enemies The<br>Stumbling of the weak the hardening of<br>the wicked the backsliding of some and<br>the desperate blasphemies and profanus<br>of others the sad desolations of Christ<br>churches and woeful Scandal that has<br>fallen on the Christian profession are<br>and reading that quote it kind of fell<br>into place I I understood what was going<br>on in his mind that the English Civil<br>War was the product for him of<br>antinomian Doctrine<br>now there's a certain plausibility to<br>that but of course it's completely wrong<br>um but for back that doesn't matter that<br>it was completely wrong for Baxter it<br>made sense<br>because if you're living through a<br>trauma<br>and I'm convinced that the Civil War was<br>a trauma for Baxter and left him<br>traumatized if you're living through a<br>trauma you need to find some way of<br>regaining control and one way of<br>regaining control is to find someone to<br>blame<br>someone who is the other<br>the other not us the other someone who<br>is the opposite of Who We Are<br>and Baxter's other<br>was the antinomians<br>and I say that because in that moment of<br>conversion when everything fell into a<br>place and he created a whole new system<br>of soteriology it is the mirror image of<br>antinomianism as he understood it so to<br>illustrate that he said in his first<br>published book I remained long in the<br>borders of antinomianism which I very<br>narrowly escaped so he started off with<br>antinomian ideas but then in that moment<br>of conversion reversed them so as he<br>said in another book because the<br>antinomians deny it<br>let us prove it so this the system of<br>soteriology that he developed was the<br>The Mirror Image the inverse of<br>so why was Baxter obsessed with<br>antinomianism well it was a matter of<br>his personality<br>and I think it was a matter of fear<br>which explains that through the 1650s as<br>his world settled down into something<br>more orderly and secure his obsession<br>faded with it<br>well<br>that was my PhD<br>at the end of that<br>um I I was rung up by the University of<br>Auckland and asked to teach a paper at<br>short notice on 18th and 19th century<br>European history<br>I didn't tell them that I didn't know<br>anything about 18th and 19th century<br>Europe industry but a week exactly a<br>week later I was given my first lecture<br>it was a great experience at the end of<br>that semester though all academic<br>options ran out so as Paul said I went<br>off and worked in Parliament I was the<br>clerk of the social services select<br>committee which was a really really good<br>job loved it and then<br>um discerned a call into pastoral<br>Ministry to help lead the reinvention of<br>a church to bring it from the 19th<br>century into the 21st century we called<br>it life switch we just began again we<br>built it from the ground up<br>and after four years of that in May of<br>2004 I heard about a job that was going<br>at the University of otago teaching<br>church history<br>and I applied and they gave it to me<br>um which you know was miraculous I mean<br>it it helped that my my PhD had been<br>published in the meantime<br>but still six years I'd been out of<br>Academia for six years<br>uh my dream of an academic career I<br>thought was a dead thing<br>while it was resurrected<br>thank you Paul<br>um<br>so I arrived in the beginning of 2005<br>and after a while after getting on top<br>of my teaching as you do I started to<br>think about my research and I thought<br>what shall I do<br>so um I asked John Morrow for his advice<br>now John Morrow was professor of British<br>history at the University of Cambridge<br>he was the supervisor of my supervisor<br>and I wrote to him and and I said what<br>what do you think what should I what<br>should I research and he suggested John<br>Owen<br>and you know I made the same mistakes<br>all over again uh you know John who<br>um and well I mean at least John Owen<br>so I started to I started to work<br>through with Owen and quite early on in<br>that project I I had another moment a<br>second in my life of of of inspiration<br>scholarly inspiration because I was<br>reading through a sermon that he<br>preached to Parliament in in the 29th of<br>April 1646 it's two days after Charles<br>the first has surrendered to the Scots<br>so the war the first phase of the war is<br>pretty well over and I want to read you<br>what he says just part of this this in<br>this sermon I was really struck by this<br>when I read it<br>um<br>oh yeah I forgot about that oh yeah no<br>this this is worth stopping for yeah I<br>was going to tell you um that both you<br>know prolific writers this is a broad<br>sheet from 1681 a dialogue between the<br>pope and the devil about Owen and Baxter<br>and the Pope says to the devil shall we<br>allow these scribbling fellows to write<br>forever<br>they feed the press as Bex defeats his<br>wolf and it like their desires as large<br>and as hell and like the horse leech it<br>sucks and is never satisfied they have a<br>kind of ambitious itch to scribble so<br>you know the the the the the two most<br>prolific authors of 17th century<br>religious history and I'm trying to deal<br>with both<br>um but it was great it's great anyway<br>sorry uh here we go back to Owen this is<br>the sermon he said he now in this sermon<br>he's he's he's warning Parliament about<br>two sorts of people the first sort of<br>the people who got England into the<br>trouble in the first place secondly<br>people who are Disturbed in their Optics<br>or have gotten false glasses<br>representing all things under them in<br>dubious colors in other words they're<br>not seeing clearly they need to change<br>their lenses<br>which way so ever they look they can see<br>nothing but errors errors of all sizes<br>sorts six and sixes errors and heresies<br>from the beginning to the end<br>as if men should come into a field and<br>seeing some red weeds and cockle among<br>the corn should instantly affirm this no<br>corn here right people who only see the<br>weeds and not the corn<br>and what struck me as I read that is<br>that he was describing with remarkable<br>Precision a man he had never met Richard<br>Baxter who at that time was an army<br>chaplain deep among the weeds seeing<br>only the weeds and worried about the<br>weeds so I I began to think what would<br>happen if you put these two men together<br>now they had a great deal uh in common<br>an enormous amount in common<br>both the same age you can see their life<br>dates they were born within months of<br>each other both Puritans and I realize I<br>haven't explained that but I'm not going<br>to<br>um<br>both on this on the side of parliament<br>in the Civil War<br>both involved in highly decorated are<br>dedicated pastoral Ministry both<br>prolific writers both annoying the pope<br>and the devil<br>and the central question I set out to<br>answer is<br>why did they not like each other<br>and why did that matter I mean they had<br>so much in common<br>why that but they didn't like each other<br>that they really didn't like each other<br>so why is that why did they not like<br>each other well there's there's so many<br>layers to the of the answer to that<br>question and again you know you're<br>welcome to buy the book<br>um<br>but let me let me just sort of summarize<br>a few of the main and most accessible<br>ones just briefly um if if we if we put<br>them together we can compare them so<br>Baxter was an only child<br>whereas Owen was one of at least six<br>children<br>um Baxter remarkably and unusually for a<br>minister in England at the time never<br>went to University it was self-taught<br>Owen was a doctor of divinity and became<br>um Baxter never stopped talking about<br>himself<br>but<br>Owen really really gave himself away<br>and I and I mean that so here are the 23<br>published volumes of Owen's work sitting<br>on my shelf<br>and in all of those volumes he makes<br>absolutely<br>no mention of his family except for one<br>passing reference to his father<br>he just gives us nothing<br>and that comes from a genuine humility<br>he believes that the world is just not<br>interested in him<br>he's appalled by Baxter who thinks that<br>the world is very interested in him and<br>and he'll just tell the world a lot<br>um about him<br>uh but can you see how that would be<br>great<br>that that was that was just not going to<br>help<br>so partly if you know how do you get<br>Owen how do you how do you recapture<br>Owen<br>well you put him next to Baxter and and<br>you see Owen in a new light when you put<br>them side by side<br>uh Baxter had a traumatic experience of<br>a Civil War and was thrust into<br>itineracy so he didn't stand kind of<br>Minster he could he was chased out of<br>town by a violent mob that with Cub<br>clubs threatened to kill me he said<br>Owen was the opposite he was in Essex<br>and and the war went all over the<br>country but it didn't touch Essex so he<br>carried on with stability and continuity<br>and safety Owen we are told by one of<br>his biographers was indeed a little<br>impatient of um of contradiction didn't<br>like to be contradicted indeed he was<br>impatient of contradiction now just<br>think about that for a moment right<br>I am strongly provoked to blare about<br>anything that I do confidently think to<br>be true and weighty<br>right so Owen was Easily Aggravated and<br>that was that was it was a fascinating<br>thing to excavate<br>to try and understand what's going on<br>and what I hope you're seeing is<br>something that Paul alluded to that<br>people are not walking sets of ideas<br>they don't come to their ideas in a<br>pristine environment very much shaped by<br>geography by personality by life events<br>very much shaped and what this shows<br>even that list there is that before Owen<br>and Baxter even met<br>this was never going to go well<br>but what really did the damage<br>to their relationship<br>throughout the 1650s the the most<br>important person in England was someone<br>actually you may have heard of Oliver<br>Cromwell<br>now um Baxter didn't like Oliver<br>Cromwell<br>um but he liked his son<br>Richard Cromwell so Cromwell died in<br>September 1658 and his son Richard<br>became Lord protector of England and and<br>here at last was Baxter for reasons I<br>won't go into it the height of his<br>confidence at the height of his powers<br>really in kidderminster and as an author<br>and under the kind of Godly ruler that<br>he had been looking for in Richard<br>Cromwell and then in April 1659 the Army<br>engineered what was effectively a coup<br>d'etat<br>and within a month the protectorate had<br>come to an end and Richard Cromwell had<br>resigned<br>well Baxter knew who to blame it was the<br>Army but at some point at some point<br>later I don't know when he he was<br>talking to his friend a London minister<br>called Thomas Minton<br>and Menton had an interesting detail<br>Manton said that one day during that<br>decisive month of April 1659 he was<br>heading to a meeting at Wallingford<br>house<br>now Wallingford house is where the Army<br>generals held had their headquarters<br>right so Menton says he walked up the<br>stairs and he came to the doorway of the<br>room where the meeting was happening and<br>he's just opened the door slightly ajah<br>and he heard a voice saying he must come<br>down<br>and he will come down<br>well Menton was taken aback by that so<br>he closed the door and he went back down<br>the stairs and he left but he thought he<br>knew whose that voice was it was the<br>chaplain to those Army generals and just<br>take a guess just have a wild stab in<br>let's let's imagine<br>let's imagine that Richard Baxter is is<br>driving a train<br>and then it's moving at impressive speed<br>in the right direction all is going<br>sublimely well and then he feels a<br>wobble in the engine and and it starts<br>to totter from side to side and then it<br>goes over derails lands on its side<br>slides through the Dust for hundreds of<br>meters and he's thrown around in the<br>cabin and but able to extract himself<br>and he climbs out and he shakes himself<br>off and he starts to walk back up the<br>tracks and he makes it to the point<br>where he can see that someone has been<br>meddling with the tracks<br>and while he's standing there just<br>pondering this Thomas Minton comes up<br>and Thomas says uh hello Richard how are<br>you and Richard says well I'm not about<br>flesh I was driving along in my train<br>and it came off the rails and I'm gonna<br>have to live for the rest of my life<br>among the wreckage<br>and Thomas Manson says oh sorry to hear<br>that and Richard says and look look<br>someone has been meddling with the<br>tracks and Thomas Madden says well uh<br>Richard<br>um I couldn't sleep last night so I went<br>for a walk and it was dark but the moon<br>was out and I could see someone meddling<br>with the railway tracks and and as he<br>looked up I could have sworn that it was<br>well of course it was John Owen I mean<br>for Baxter<br>that had<br>implacable plausibility<br>right the grass is green the sky is blue<br>and of course it was John Owen<br>who derailed my train<br>who who made everything go wrong because<br>it really did go wrong after April 1659<br>the end of the protectorate the the<br>ushering and of Chaos<br>resolved only by the restoration of the<br>monarchy and Charles II and the<br>restoration of the Bishops of the Church<br>of England who wasted no time take their<br>revenge and they set the terms for<br>membership in the Church of England so<br>high that no conscientious Puritan could<br>ever agree to them and so around 2 000<br>Puritan ministers were booted out of<br>their livings in the Church of England<br>Richard Baxter among them and he was<br>never even allowed to go back to<br>kidderminster to say goodbye and<br>everything that he had built up in his<br>Parish all of that model of pastoral<br>Ministry totally undone<br>and he could trace all of that disaster<br>back to 1659 and back to John Owen this<br>so Baxter said in 1684 the national<br>concerns made so deep a wound in my<br>heart as never will be fully healed in<br>and that is exactly right<br>this is this is the openness<br>and sheer humanness that I appreciate in<br>Dexter<br>that he never got over<br>that disappointment<br>nor I think did he ever ever manage to<br>forgive Owen for his actions in bringing<br>well I've talked quite a bit about my<br>PhD for reasons that will become<br>apparent and I've wanted to bring in my<br>book on Owen and Baxter just to<br>illustrate the kind of intellectual<br>history that interests me but let me say<br>something just very very quickly about<br>the autobiography<br>so um as Paul said it's very long<br>um<br>also very expensive you could have your<br>own copy for a thousand dollars<br>you could<br>and it contains uh nearly 6 000<br>footnotes<br>so just to illustrate what we're doing<br>in a scholarly Edition like that this is<br>the the first page of Baxter's<br>autobiography you see you have his text<br>up here and Below you have our footnotes<br>which are over here right<br>so what what what what a work like this<br>is doing is building research<br>infrastructure it helps other Scholars<br>to come along and do their research<br>and the thing that I appreciate about<br>this project is that it will endure well<br>beyond anything else I've done<br>if Western Civilization survives this<br>long it's not impossible that in 200<br>years Scholars might still be using<br>footnotes that I've written<br>all right I appreciate that<br>which helps to explain partly why I'm<br>still carrying on with an edited edition<br>of Baxter's letters for 1659 to 60.<br>those decisive and disappointing years<br>uh which will be published if I can<br>so<br>how did that happen<br>a professor of church history<br>whose work is published by Oxford<br>University press<br>well this is the Happy scene isn't it<br>this is me on the lap of my grandfather<br>he's reading a book to me when I'm four<br>that's my father<br>he was 64 when I was born<br>and in 1970 that was old<br>the retirement age was 60.<br>this is my family<br>my father Douglas my mother Bridget my<br>older brother Mike and my sister and<br>four years old<br>and I like this photo<br>um but you know it reminds me that that<br>there really was happiness in my<br>childhood there absolutely was<br>but there were<br>problems in the family and those<br>problems became only more apparent when<br>my father died when I was eight years<br>old<br>and my mother<br>um who had experienced childhood trauma<br>of her own was just not well equipped to<br>bring up three children on her own<br>and she became increasingly alcoholic<br>and depressed<br>and my brother and sister left home<br>relatively early and so my teenage years<br>were spent living at home with<br>a mother who was<br>depressed and alcoholic<br>I have a great respect for her because<br>she<br>she recovered from those conditions I I<br>honor her but let me tell you they would<br>they were difficult years<br>and looking back I think there were<br>three things that changed my life<br>the first is that I came to Faith as a<br>teenager and I think it was important<br>for me to understand that in the death<br>and resurrection of Jesus God does not<br>leave us alone in our suffering but<br>joins us in it<br>the second thing is my wife Kate<br>thank you Kate for all your love and<br>support over all these years<br>and the third thing that made all the<br>difference<br>is history<br>I fell in love with history as a<br>teenager<br>admittedly my beginning wasn't as flesh<br>as it might have been this is from my<br>still it kind of been all bad in in my<br>seventh form year 13 I won the seventh<br>form history prize so doing something<br>right<br>let me show you my academic transcript<br>it's you know it's well it's good I mean<br>it's okay uh range of marks from a down<br>to B and apologies to the criticists for<br>the loan B minus<br>uh you know it's okay but it's not<br>dazzling<br>the first time I got an A plus for a<br>written assignment was in my honors year<br>and I I can still recall going to see<br>the lecturer to receive my assignment<br>and his feedback and he said to me well<br>I couldn't decide if this was an A or an<br>A plus so I tossed a coin<br>foreign<br>but I tell you at the time I went away<br>exhilarated<br>I I I literally thought to myself I can<br>do this<br>that was really important<br>but you look in my my marks in my honors<br>yeah Three A's in a B plus I think I've<br>reached the point in my life where the B<br>plus doesn't hurt anymore<br>so I wanted to carry on and do a PhD and<br>I'd focused on New Zealand history so I<br>went to the lecturer who might supervise<br>a PhD in New Zealand history and I I can<br>remember her explaining to me that some<br>students<br>um well they flourish in in a PhD<br>um and some don't<br>and it was pretty Apparent from that<br>conversation that she thought I needed<br>so she declined to supervise me<br>so that's when I thought okay<br>well I looked at the Protestant<br>Reformation and seventh woman like that<br>so I went along and I went to see Glenn<br>Burgess<br>and Greenberg just took me on<br>with my three A's and a B plus<br>I now had a supervisor<br>what I needed was a scholarship<br>but I took the risk<br>thank you Kate for backing me in this I<br>took the risk I had a year of student<br>allowance left I began a PhD and when I<br>applied again the next year I got one<br>but you recall me saying that I had no<br>idea what I was doing<br>I can remember being in the third year<br>of my thesis and and thinking I'm not<br>and then I came across that quote<br>and I I just can't explain it but<br>I came alive<br>and in the rest of that year I wrote<br>five out of six chapters in my PhD<br>and I wrote a PhD that was really<br>very good<br>I'm going to quote from John Morrow<br>because I sent the PHD to John mile he<br>was editing a series with Cambridge<br>University press I want I asked him if<br>he'd publisher he he was genuinely<br>gutted if I may use that word to say he<br>couldn't because he only had a quota of<br>so many and he needed to choose books<br>for commercial reasons but this is what<br>he said in his report on my thesis we<br>were all and I was in particular just<br>plain stunned by the intellectual<br>quality of this dissertation<br>it has a maturity that is quite out of<br>the ordinary there is a Clarity in<br>everything about it that quite takes the<br>breath away<br>there is a deep strategic sense about it<br>it builds powerfully and inexorably from<br>its careful and deceptively slow<br>Reflections on the changing<br>historiographical fortunes of Richard<br>Baxter and on the way antinomianism has<br>been understood and willfully<br>misunderstood at the time uh and in<br>recent times<br>there is a transparent intelligence that<br>rises to the theological and historical<br>challenges<br>there is an exceptional ability to stand<br>back and keep everything in proportion<br>the Elegance of mind is matched by the<br>Elegance of writing this is a stunning<br>achievement<br>I began with no idea<br>three years eight months and eleven days<br>later I produced a thesis of that<br>quality<br>despite the misgivings of that first<br>potential supervisor<br>I blossomed<br>I gained I developed I honed a<br>formidable intelligence<br>and my life has never been the same<br>since<br>the first is that at the University of<br>otago we attract the brightest students<br>in the country<br>and they come into our papers and they<br>do exceedingly well<br>and they get A's<br>and they finish it looks like with ease<br>sure they work hard<br>and when they walk across the stage at<br>graduation we celebrate them and applaud<br>them and we should absolutely do that<br>all of that is to be so appreciated in a<br>night<br>but we have other students who come to<br>the University of otago<br>and they have come out of childhood<br>trauma that is a drag on their life<br>and they may not have had<br>the kind of privileged secondary school<br>education<br>that others have had<br>and they have to work very hard and they<br>struggle and they may fail a paper but<br>they keep going and they finish their<br>qualification<br>and when we recognize those students we<br>Paul mentioned my work in leading those<br>diplomas for near Miss domestic and<br>international students one of the<br>reasons I was so committed to Leading<br>that project is that I was once a<br>near-miss student<br>I nearly missed out on a PhD<br>and we might bear my story in mind next<br>time we're evaluating a student whose<br>grades maybe aren't that flash but who<br>the second thing that I want to say is<br>that<br>as a university<br>we're in a tough spot<br>this is a difficult season<br>we Face a number of huge challenges that<br>and I think this is a good moment to<br>remind ourselves why we're here<br>I know that a university exists to<br>create an advanced knowledge<br>but above and beyond that for me<br>we enrich lives<br>whether we are academic staff teaching<br>in the classroom or professional staff<br>serving and support together<br>we enrich lives<br>my life has been enriched by the study<br>ways that are impossible to measure ways<br>that are intangible<br>but they are real and they shape the<br>as I put to work what I gained from<br>studying history at the highest level<br>we enrich lives<br>and the final thought about how I got<br>here is just to Simply say that I could<br>never ever have got here on my own<br>at no IPL is there ever a solitary<br>genius<br>who manage their success in Splendid<br>isolation<br>my progress has relied on the support<br>and generosity of so many others<br>as I reflect on that photo with my<br>father it you know it means something<br>that we were reading a book together<br>so grateful for the support of my family<br>my mother my brother my sister<br>for the support of my family my boys<br>I'll always be grateful to Glenn Burgess<br>for taking me on<br>as a PhD student<br>and taking that risk<br>I've had research collaborators who have<br>become the most wonderful friends and<br>colleagues<br>I've had the most lovely and wonderful<br>colleagues here at otago in the theology<br>program not least my first hits of<br>as well as a culture in that program of<br>research success that has modeled what<br>it is to be an academic it all made a<br>difference I have been trusted with a<br>number of<br>leadership roles<br>I'm grateful to Tony Valentine Jess<br>Palmer harleen Hayne Pat Craig and Helen<br>Nicholson along with my theology<br>colleagues who have released me into<br>those roles even at a cost to their own<br>I've got a lot to be grateful for we we<br>have a lot to be grateful for<br>we have the freedom to indulge our love<br>of learning every day and to pass that<br>on to our students<br>and be paid for it<br>it is a great privilege and I am<br>sincerely grateful I'm grateful to<br>Richard Baxter<br>he never gave me permission to poke<br>around in his life<br>though someone who wrote 140 books uh<br>1200 letters and you know long order<br>biography perhaps can't complain<br>but to quote John notice modern the<br>burden of church history is among other<br>things the call to converse more<br>humanely with the dead and I hope that<br>I've done that today<br>finally I'm grateful to you my friends<br>and colleagues from across the<br>university and the City<br>who have stayed behind on a Monday<br>evening just to hear me explain why<br>Richard Baxter met us to me<br>I am sincerely grateful<br>birthday coming<br>through<br>foreign<br>I am the pro Vice Chancellor of the<br>humanities division which is the<br>division in which Tim works and spends<br>most of his uh daily life here at the<br>University and it's my great pleasure to<br>offer the vote of thanks to Tim for this<br>evening's lecture<br>I'm a common lawyer by background which<br>means that I spend my time when it's not<br>dealing with Administration I spend my<br>time tracing back case law and trying to<br>understand why the law has become what<br>it is and effectively that makes me a<br>poor man's historian and so it's lovely<br>tonight to sit and listen to a trained<br>historian who was excelling at his art<br>and to remind me of the wonders of that<br>discipline here at the University so Tim<br>Bravo<br>when I had a quick I get to pre-read the<br>lecture so I get to read it and then<br>hear it and it was wonderful to read but<br>it was so good to hear it live so thank<br>you but when I went digging to have a<br>look at Richard Baxter<br>um I read this one of his quotes<br>study hard<br>for the well is deep<br>papers<br>but I think if Richard were here today<br>he might have to rethink that quote at<br>least in relation to you<br>I want to draw out a couple of things<br>from your lecture the first one is and<br>and it segues nicely from the quote that<br>you read from John loudus modern about<br>being humane<br>I thanked him that you demonstrate<br>humaneness in your life here at the<br>University<br>to a huge extent and this lecture was a<br>part of that but there are lots of ways<br>in which you demonstrate your<br>humanneness and your humility I think<br>it's clearly evident in your scholarship<br>research is so often incremental and the<br>discoveries and the revelations that we<br>wonderful academics come across actually<br>often happen by accident or are<br>unplanned or were not the ones we<br>thought we were going to find and I<br>think Tim you beautifully demonstrated<br>that there were two or three moments in<br>your research that shed light on things<br>and gave you a new way of looking at<br>things and so I thank you thank you for<br>pointing that out for us again and<br>reminding us that that is what research<br>is about and that does require humility<br>to recognize that that we are sometimes<br>in the lapse of those we research<br>waiting and hoping and wondering what's<br>going to come and that certainly<br>happened for you I think secondly in<br>relation to your scholarship and again<br>you've shown that tonight<br>you just allow your subjects to be<br>you let Richard Baxter speak and you<br>give him the space to be warts and all<br>turns out not entirely a nice guy all of<br>the time likes the sound of his own<br>voice<br>but you are honest with him about that<br>rather than trying to cover it up and I<br>thank you for that I think that that<br>gives us a chance to learn things that<br>we might not have<br>been able to learn had we been busy<br>trying to ascribe our own theories first<br>so your humility and the way that you<br>approach your scholarship is something<br>that we all admire and I want to thank<br>you for that<br>and you're teaching so Paul Paul talked<br>wee bit about some of Tim's teaching<br>achievements I want to just pull out a<br>quote from some of the information that<br>went through when he won his national<br>award um his one of his students is he<br>had a real understanding for the<br>obstacles we were facing as students and<br>I thought it was worth hiding that given<br>the story you heard about Tim himself<br>and his own journey through Academia and<br>University<br>you care about your students you have a<br>humility about your role as teacher and<br>what it might mean to your students and<br>you let them learn around you and with<br>you and I think about the work you've<br>done as leading teaching within our<br>division and while you're associate Dean<br>academic you um you initiated the<br>teaching and learning Symposium you<br>created the teaching and learning<br>circles where for those of you who are<br>not members of the division they're a<br>chance for those of us who want to<br>continue with our thinking about<br>teaching and learning to get in with a<br>bunch of colleagues and share stories<br>with each other and I think someone who<br>creates that<br>is obviously someone who is showing<br>humility because it's that recognition<br>that we need to listen and learn from<br>each other to become better at what we<br>do so I think your humility and your<br>teaching shines through<br>I think Tim that your leadership is<br>deeply pastoral<br>and I wanted to say that tonight I think<br>it's important to declare that you seek<br>to understand the people that you lead<br>you listen to them and you empathize<br>with them and you're always looking<br>ahead to what you might be able to do to<br>help them become better at their roles<br>and I think that's an incredibly humble<br>way to lead because you allow the person<br>to be what and all and to walk alongside<br>them<br>so I wanted to say thank you for that<br>and particularly<br>as a university leader it's not always<br>easy to do that so so Bravo Tim for that<br>and then secondly alongside that<br>humility I wanted to honor you for your<br>belief in the good of the university and<br>your research and your talk tonight<br>is so strongly Echoes In and affirms<br>that view that what we do here as a<br>university in whatever discipline we<br>find ourselves in is a public and human<br>good<br>that we are about exploring and learning<br>and listening and hopefully in the<br>course of that becoming better at being<br>humans together<br>members of your church family are here<br>to acknowledge tonight there's quite a<br>few of them and they are very definitely<br>also the beneficiaries of your gift for<br>teaching<br>they get to listen to Tim give sermons<br>regularly at dcbc<br>and I know that there was a point not in<br>the um two distant past where you were<br>grappling again with the question about<br>what you would do next and whether you<br>would accept a return to the vocation of<br>being a church pastor or whether you<br>would commit even more strongly to your<br>role as an academic<br>and I want to say that thankfully it<br>wasn't a loss to your church Community<br>because you continue to be involved but<br>I wanted to say to you personally thank<br>you for honoring your vocation to be a<br>University academic and there are many<br>of us here who share that vocation and<br>we know that it's not always an easy one<br>to live out it's difficult and it's<br>tough but you stood here giving the<br>Clarion call as to why being an academic<br>is such a valuable and important place<br>or role in our society so thank you<br>thank you for choosing that we<br>acknowledge that you chose that when you<br>could have done other things so Bravo so<br>I'm glad Tim that as much as Richard<br>Baxter matters to you that the<br>university nurses more<br>and that indeed more than that people<br>matter to you so thank you for all that<br>and I have<br>a little gift that is a real nation of<br>tonight</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
