During the time I have been working in this field, it has undergone a bona fide scientific revolution. <br><br>Revolutions aren't that common in science -in my talk, I'll reflect on what it's been like to be in the middle of one. I'll first talk about how the AI revolution has impacted my own research area of cognitive science. My main interest is in the human faculty of language: how does the brain implement our amazing ability to speak about what we see, and think, and do? I've explored these questions for many years as a university academic.<br><br>More recently I've also explored them with the Auckland company Soul Machines, which I have collaborated with since it was founded in 2016. Many advances in AI now come from commercial companies, and Soul Machines is no exception: I'll give a taste of some of the work I'm doing at Soul Machines, and discuss how its frankly dazzling AI technologies may offer interesting new insights into models of cognition.<br><br>While AI technologies can help advance science, their proliferation in society can also be a scary prospect. Are AI systems going to take our jobs? Are they making decisions that would be better left to people? AI systems are at the heart of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter: what effect are these systems having on the thought processes of their billions of users? <br><br>I think AI researchers have a responsibility to worry about these questions, and to lead a public debate about the proper uses of the models they build. In the second part of my talk I'll discuss some work I've done in this area, at Otago's very own Ministry of Magic, the Centre for AI and Public Policy.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

otago my name is richard<br>blakey i'm the deputy vice chancellor<br>for research and enterprise and i'm<br>going to be your mc for tonight my main<br>job is to get out of the way and let the<br>main event happen but there is a little<br>bit of housekeeping<br>firstly i'd like to acknowledge that our<br>vice chancellor and our chancellor send<br>their apologies uh they are on<br>university duties in central otago this<br>evening so can't be present in person<br>perhaps they are joining our online<br>audience i'm not sure<br>um<br>i'd like to also<br>i'd like to acknowledge though those of<br>you that have come to attend in person<br>and those that are joining us online<br>in a live stream or maybe viewing this<br>wonderful occasion<br>virtually at another other time welcome<br>welcome and thrice welcome you all<br>these are occasions for the university<br>but also for our our communities our pub<br>public here in dunedin and otago and the<br>rest of the new zealand<br>and so welcome to this event celebrating<br>the promotion to professor of ali not<br>ali has some special visitors here in<br>the audience malay<br>mia and helen and i pass on my<br>acknowledgements and thanks from the<br>university for<br>your role supporting<br>whanau and ali in<br>the days and the weeks and the years<br>that have led up to this uh wonderful<br>occasion<br>i believe there are actually people that<br>may be live online in the uk<br>in france and even the north island so<br>welcome to you all<br>um<br>this is a this is a great uh thing to<br>celebrate promotion to the position of<br>professor here at the university of<br>otago and it's a it's a distinction that<br>is not awarded lightly it does require a<br>demonstration of significant achievement<br>in the areas of<br>teaching in research and in service at<br>the level that we call sustained<br>outstanding leadership and competence<br>and it is that<br>outstanding leadership over a sustained<br>period that is critical and ali as you<br>will see tonight from<br>the introduction that will be given by<br>the pro vice chancellor<br>and his talk<br>it will be clear how that has been<br>expressed in the work that he has done<br>in artificial intelligence and other<br>related areas<br>but but for me um this is an area where<br>the demonstration is very clear across<br>all of those across all of those areas<br>in teaching<br>ali has demonstrated<br>development of curriculum in an area<br>that is rapidly changing the need to be<br>research informed in our curricula is<br>vital and that research has informed<br>this<br>curriculum in this area<br>in research and engagement with industry<br>that is outstanding of many students i<br>think uh<br>a a uh understated fact went in that one<br>of ali students now<br>leads a billion dollar company or a<br>company that's uh<br>attracted more than a billion dollars of<br>investment his current workers<br>split between academia and industry with<br>soul machines as we'll see through the<br>talk<br>but it's also service beyond the<br>discipline and um<br>work<br>from the university that we are most<br>grateful for uh includes work with<br>colleagues in uh humanities law and<br>social sciences in the center for<br>artificial intelligence and public<br>policy looking not only at the<br>at the ways that this work can benefit<br>us commercially but also the risk that<br>might be associated with artificial<br>intelligence and new technologies and<br>working with colleagues in law and<br>philosophy to<br>to really be at the leading edge of that<br>we are deeply deeply appreciative so ali<br>on behalf of the university<br>congratulations on this significant<br>achievement<br>and it's now my pleasure to invite the<br>pro-vice chancellor from the division of<br>sciences professor richard barker to<br>give you a more detailed introduction<br>for the lecture that we're about to hear<br>professor blakey tena<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight professor alistair<br>knott better known as ali to give his<br>inaugural professorial professorial<br>lecture at the university of otago as<br>just indicated by professor blakey ali<br>is one of our newer professors at the<br>university of otago having received a<br>well-deserved promotion to the position<br>in february of this year<br>ali was born in the uk england<br>more precisely but i will let him tell<br>his own story but one bit of extra<br>information i can share is that although<br>born in england he did most of his<br>schooling in brussels where he attended<br>a european school with classes held in<br>several different languages he credits<br>his interest in linguistics to having<br>been reared in this environment<br>although he has been living in new<br>zealand for more than 25 years he still<br>thinks of himself as european in fact<br>very passionate pro-eu<br>now i presume that ali is aware that<br>britain recently left the eu<br>and we can read into this that perhaps<br>ali is disappointed at that turn of<br>events<br>my suggestion then is that ali take this<br>up with boris johnson<br>it turns out they're old mates ali and<br>boris went to the same european school<br>where boris was a couple of years ahead<br>of ali<br>ali and his briefing notes for me<br>speculated on why it was that boris<br>evidently learnt nothing while he was at<br>school of any real value<br>and then there was some further<br>speculation on what would have happened<br>had their roles been reversed<br>i guess that would mean that we would be<br>about to hear the ipl from one professor<br>johnson and we could all look forward to<br>the next hour filled with chaotic<br>musings<br>back to the factual<br>ali received his ba honours from the<br>university oxford before heading to<br>edinburgh where he earned his msc and<br>then phd at the same time he was<br>employed as a research associate in the<br>human communication research center<br>ali joined our department of computer<br>science in 1998 he was employed as a<br>lecturer and thus has successfully has<br>worked his way up through the academic<br>promotion process culminating in this<br>his inaugural professorial lecture<br>as professor blakey has already<br>indicated<br>appointment to professor at the<br>university of otago is far from easy and<br>requires all-round ability<br>it is not enough to excel in one area of<br>academic endeavor you must excel in all<br>in research professor knott has more<br>than 110 peer-reviewed publications<br>which speak to the breadth<br>as well as the depths of his research<br>area<br>his work has been recognised through<br>significant grant success and we can<br>point to recognition from te aparangi<br>royal society of new zealand who awarded<br>him a prestigious marsden grant in 2013<br>as well as a grant from the new zealand<br>law foundation in 2016.<br>professor knott's research has had<br>impact outside of the usual norms of<br>academia he has six patents to his name<br>associated with his work at seoul<br>machines an auckland-based technology<br>startup that is going just from success<br>to success as we we just heard<br>his teaching is also excellent both at<br>the undergraduate level and at the<br>post-graduate level he has supervised 22<br>phd students to completion two of whom<br>have been recognised on the division of<br>science's exceptional thesis list<br>professor knott's promotion also<br>recognises his service to the university<br>and<br>professional communities this includes<br>significant roles in his home department<br>particularly with a focus on support for<br>maori and pacific students he was also<br>co-founder for our center for artificial<br>intelligence and public policy or as he<br>calls it our very own ministry for magic<br>nationally he was a founding member of<br>new zealand's artificial intelligence<br>forum and internationally he has served<br>on the editorial boards for three<br>significant journals including cambridge<br>elements and semantics as well as<br>serving as program chair or committee<br>member for a large number of<br>of course we are not the only ones to<br>recognise that ali has talent<br>alas<br>ali and malay<br>are off to victoria university to take<br>up new positions we are going to miss<br>you both terribly but i wish you all the<br>best in new jobs in your new jobs and as<br>much as it pains me to say this<br>i know you will give victoria your best<br>as you have both done for us here at<br>otago i would just like to say a<br>personal and very public thank you to<br>you both for all that you have done<br>one practical matter that ali asked me<br>to mention<br>is that having sold their home in<br>dunedin they now have two cats looking<br>for<br>new and kind owners<br>so on that note of feline opportunity i<br>shall finish and ask that you please<br>join me in welcoming tonight's speaker<br>professor alistain knott<br>very nice to see you all i must say<br>uh<br>very very nice to see you all here just<br>delighted and i'm<br>very happy to be doing this it's really<br>quite a pleasure so uh<br>yeah i'm uh<br>i'm gonna tell you something about uh<br>about me i guess it's like an extended<br>me um<br>so as with all me i guess it starts with<br>uh with me being little and i have to<br>say that i wasn't always uh an extremely<br>powerful magician<br>um<br>there were times uh when i was young<br>when i was just a simple village lad<br>really um in in the small settlement of<br>swindon<br>and there's me um<br>in all innocence but gradually<br>as as you grow and uh and<br>start to understand some things about<br>the world and start to question the<br>world and think about the world that<br>you're in and the place that you play in<br>it and the role that you have in it uh<br>encompass and and and take on the world<br>of the intellect<br>and that certainly uh happened for me<br>around adolescence<br>and uh<br>there's me at the age when uh<br>i suddenly started taking an interest in<br>in the world and uh<br>and my place in it and what it was to be<br>a person i suppose and have thoughts<br>like that and i was very lucky as<br>richard said i went to a school in in<br>belgium and in this european school um<br>one of the subjects on the curriculum<br>was philosophy<br>and uh i was<br>my great my first collaborator my friend<br>phil<br>which we had<br>lots and lots of interesting escapades<br>and<br>yeah did all sorts of interesting things<br>together<br>anyway at school i had some very good<br>teachers and<br>one of them was a philosophy teacher we<br>had to learn philosophy in our school<br>and not all the students appreciate it<br>but i just lapped it up i thought it was<br>wonderful stuff it's just i guess a way<br>of thinking which i just really<br>appreciated i think that that was the<br>place where i first<br>got launched on this journey of academia<br>that i find myself on<br>so that was one huge influence<br>another big influence was my mom<br>actually and there she is in the picture<br>on the right my mum was also a teacher<br>at this school um and she taught me for<br>some of my time there she was an english<br>teacher<br>for one of her jobs and<br>she was very interested in everything to<br>do with language and i think again that<br>sort of like started to sort of<br>inculcate this interest in language<br>which is what i've been doing my whole<br>career i guess and there she is talking<br>to a garden gnome just to demonstrate<br>her linguistic<br>interests<br>um<br>yeah so those were two very strong<br>influences<br>and and actually my mum was really<br>interested in poetry and in particular<br>well actually in all sorts of things but<br>the thing that kind of lodged in my mind<br>was the poetry of shakespeare and in<br>particular his sonnets and i'm going to<br>just stick up a couple of sonnets where<br>i can just remember sort of looking at<br>and<br>mulling over when i was you know a high<br>school kid and thinking how amazing<br>these are<br>but i had this sort of interesting<br>thought about them which is very<br>linguistic which is to think well these<br>are the sonnets that shakespeare wrote<br>but he could have written others right<br>he could have written other sonnets<br>there's this kind of whole space of of<br>possible shakespeare sonnets and this is<br>a super kind of<br>it's like a linguistic way of thinking<br>about the world it's like there's this<br>sentence in this sentence but there's<br>other possible sentences there's an<br>infinite number of possible sentences an<br>infinite number of possible sonnets that<br>he could have written<br>and i found myself trying to work out<br>what the structures were and how you<br>could create other ones and actually i<br>was quite sort of<br>i was quite mechanical about this<br>because i had<br>like a very simple village computer from<br>the early 1980s and so i sat down and<br>tried to program something which would<br>make shakespeare like sonnet and that<br>part i have to say even though mum<br>sort of<br>taught me how to see things in a way my<br>father certainly taught me how to build<br>things and i was definitely inclined not<br>just to sort of think about this space<br>but to get in there and try and kind of<br>tinker and produce<br>something like a shakespeare sonnet<br>so i went away and did this and here my<br>mom actually found these in some deep<br>archive somewhere and there they are as<br>fresh as the day that they were written<br>oh then vouch save me but this gentle<br>lip oh then save me but this precious<br>fear and you can sort of understand how<br>it's done it's like you know template<br>filling or whatever but i was<br>extremely interested by this<br>and um i won't dwell on these other than<br>to say that there's quite a lot of<br>breasts in my uh sonnets and you know<br>you can sort of imagine a young boy<br>actually there's breast and<br>shakespeare's sonnets too so i don't<br>want to say that i'm the only one<br>he was a young man as well<br>um writing to men and women who knows<br>who i'm writing to it's a pretty weird<br>creature that i'm writing here so uh<br>yeah<br>here's another one here's another one<br>here's another one there's breasts all<br>over<br>but i got<br>interested in this kind of stuff i was<br>interested in how<br>um and how the human mind could produce<br>language and what the human mind was<br>doing when it was producing language<br>so imagine my surprise when i received<br>an invitation to attend the oxford<br>school of magic<br>and there it is um that's the college<br>that i went to and that's the library<br>that's the upstairs library it's very<br>nice<br>not<br>you can't really call an information<br>services building but uh yeah it was a<br>lovely library and you could nip into<br>those little alcohols and uh and<br>and uh study there and i studied heaps<br>and i had some very uh inspiring<br>teachers there as well and i just want<br>to pick out a couple of people one of<br>them<br>is john driver um the guy on the left<br>who um<br>goodness me he he was a postgrad at the<br>time but he ended up being one of the<br>most eminent psychologists in the uk<br>and i had the experience of having<br>um my essays kind of commented on by him<br>every week um it was just extraordinary<br>it was like the things he wrote<br>how perceptive and clever he was<br>um and on the writers anita afromedes<br>and she taught me philosophy<br>and it's just the same it was like a<br>really rigorous kind of uh feedback<br>process and i really try to bring<br>something of that the flavor of the<br>supervision that i got from them to the<br>interactions that i have with my<br>students<br>yeah so there was one other person<br>who i talked to called jocelyn payne who<br>was far less academically prestigious<br>and he taught me prologue and taught me<br>how to use computers and i did a course<br>on that and again i was still thinking<br>about poems but now because i was an<br>oxford student i was going to make<br>really really powerful poems much more<br>powerful than the ones i produced at<br>school<br>and so i i found a copy of the oxford<br>english dictionary that was online<br>online in<br>the mid 80s that was like on a floppy<br>disk oh my god<br>so uh i was very pleased with that and<br>then i wrote myself<br>an actual grammar in prologue indefinite<br>clause grammar i said i'm going to link<br>this powerful grammar up to this huge<br>english dictionary and now look what<br>poems i will produce so i put those two<br>things together and actually the the<br>results of that have been mostly lost to<br>history except for one line which i can<br>remember<br>which is<br>needle or narcotic tuber i think it was<br>doing something combining definitions of<br>dictionary words it's like<br>i was somewhat disappointed but it just<br>shows you that becoming more powerful<br>doesn't necessarily mean producing<br>better stuff<br>um that's actually of the of the badness<br>of uh<br>yeah of the very worst<br>poetry in the universe probably<br>um anyway<br>i uh<br>continued doing that stuff and i thought<br>i was so interested in this kind of<br>grammar hacking grammar engineering<br>stuff that i decided to pursue it in the<br>edinburgh school of magic<br>and there is a piece of the edinburgh<br>school i think it's part of the museum<br>and um and there um i had again two<br>amazing supervisors robert dale and<br>chris melish<br>and um<br>yeah i was really interested now i'll<br>take the picture away what i was<br>interested in was<br>in particular like for my postgrad uh my<br>thesis i was interested in<br>not the structure of sentences which is<br>why i was being mostly thinking about<br>with those poems but the structure of<br>extended text what is it that makes a<br>text of several sentences hang together<br>like if you took a newspaper article and<br>you rearranged the sentences it wouldn't<br>make sense anymore so what is it that<br>makes a sentence a an extended text<br>cohere<br>it's not grammar it's something else<br>and<br>the interesting answer<br>there again had this kind of mechanical<br>kind of<br>implication if you knew the answer to<br>that question then you should be able to<br>produce coherent texts<br>for all sorts of applications for<br>instance in dialogue or in generating<br>descriptions online and in fact some of<br>the first work uh some of the first<br>online uh generated text on the on the<br>internet on the web uh was produced in<br>projects that we did back then<br>um<br>but my main thought was a theoretical<br>one i was interested in the idea that a<br>coherent text should somehow connect to<br>coherent thought it's not a super new<br>idea in fact you know you can trace the<br>idea way back uh i've got a picture here<br>of thomas hobbs who i really like<br>and i'll have a little quote for you<br>from thomas hobbs which it's just a<br>beautiful piece of language really but<br>it summarized the way i was thinking<br>about language above the level of a<br>sentence by consequence or train of<br>thoughts i understand that succession of<br>one thought to another which is called<br>to distinguish it from discourse in<br>words mental discourse when a man thinks<br>on anything whatsoever his next thought<br>after is not altogether so casual as it<br>seems to be<br>not every thought to every thought<br>succeeds indifferently and i really like<br>that expression and i think words are<br>like that so i was very interested in<br>what is it that takes you from one<br>thought to another thought what's a<br>coherent train of thought and how does<br>and then at the end of my thesis i went<br>back to sentences and i thought to<br>myself well if a coherent text reports a<br>coherent train of thought then the<br>individual sentences probably also<br>report meaningful units of thought and i<br>got thinking about the correspondences<br>between syntactic representations of<br>sentences and kind of cognitive<br>processes<br>um<br>so in oxford i learned about uh those<br>processes and cognitive processes and in<br>edinburgh i learned about how sentences<br>were structured and so i found myself<br>with this question does the syntax of of<br>a sentence have anything to do<br>with cognitive processing or what does a<br>syntax tell us if anything about<br>cognitive processing it does the syntax<br>of a sentence kind of offer an<br>interesting new empirical window onto<br>what's going on in the head<br>you know of the sort that's normally<br>studied in psychology<br>so just to kind of hook back one thing<br>that's nice to do in these things is an<br>academic uh whakapapa and there's this<br>very interesting uh kind of uh sort of<br>ancestry behind my two supervisors so uh<br>robert day on the left you can trace him<br>back to richard montague who's one of<br>the early um formal semanticists so he<br>sort of was exploring this idea that the<br>mean that the uh the meaning of a<br>sentence is a kind of<br>a mathematical function or logical<br>function of the meaning of the component<br>bits of the sentence plus the syntactic<br>structure of the sentence<br>and the guy on the right is wittgenstein<br>and uh and chris melish my other<br>supervisor kind of up is back to<br>him in a way<br>and um yeah so richard montague had this<br>very formal kind of compositional<br>semantics model of of sentences and<br>wittgenstein at least the later<br>victorious stein i might be stretching<br>this a little bit but he was definitely<br>keen on the idea the language wasn't<br>just in the head language was a public<br>phenomenon and needed to be studied as a<br>public activity rather than just thought<br>of privately and therefore language had<br>to connect to the external world and so<br>those were ideas i think which kind of i<br>was picking up on when i was in<br>edinburgh<br>that wasn't the only thing that was<br>going on in edinburgh there was other<br>magic going on that's where i met my<br>lovely wife mele and it really was a<br>very very happy time for me back then<br>and she was over visiting from new<br>zealand and uh yeah so and we met all<br>sorts of other interesting people i've<br>just put a couple of them up here so<br>shout out to oran and shout out to lars<br>who both ended up in our wedding in<br>tonga um<br>so that was a a very nice time that we<br>that we spent when we were in edinburgh<br>then<br>okay um<br>melee dragged me to new zealand well at<br>least you brought us you didn't say drag<br>invigod me to new zealand i thought i'd<br>come to otago<br>for a few years and um and i've ended up<br>being here for like almost 25 years so<br>the otago school of magic just look at<br>it it's by far the best school of magic<br>if you just look at it that is<br>absolutely the place to be for magic<br>and i was in a great place uh with all<br>sorts of extremely mysterious and<br>magical people um i'm just putting some<br>of them up here and i'm sort of<br>selecting them by by the order of which<br>they look most magical um<br>so uh just look at these mysterious<br>creatures<br>of<br>so uh i'm not going to name them but i<br>chose photos that emphasize their kind<br>of their magical<br>properties and powers<br>um<br>so yeah<br>there they all are um and it's been a<br>wonderful time with all of those people<br>and so what have i been doing here since<br>i arrived i'll take a few slides to<br>introduce that<br>um firstly<br>i had two uh beautiful daughters mia and<br>helen we've already had them mentioned<br>yes me and helen it's been fantastic fun<br>watching you grow up and you were very<br>nice when your children you're also<br>still really really cool<br>and one of the things i also wanted to<br>say was that um coming to new zealand<br>has meant being in the pacific and<br>connecting with a pacific family i've<br>got a picture there of of my cousin<br>leaky and of melee's granny meliani and<br>i just want to acknowledge that side of<br>the family too um<br>so um<br>down to the academic work i'll go<br>quickly through this um<br>i can't do any talk without using the<br>word sensory motor so there it is<br>so the question i found myself with at<br>the end of my time in edinburgh was does<br>the syntactic structure of a sentence<br>tell us about cognitive processing<br>and uh i spent<br>like maybe 12 13 14 years thinking about<br>one<br>action which was a person grabbing a cup<br>and that's a strange thing for a<br>linguist to do<br>but that's what i did it's a concrete<br>sentence it's the sort of thing that you<br>can<br>actually do and experience just by<br>looking at the world you don't have to<br>do anything with memory<br>you just have to watch the world and<br>engage with the world<br>so you can think of it from two<br>perspectives if you're a linguist you<br>can study the syntactic structure of<br>sentences that report that in all the<br>different languages of the world because<br>of course you know this can come out in<br>lots of different ways<br>if you're a neuroscientist or or a<br>psychologist you can study the brain<br>process involved in actually grabbing a<br>cup<br>or in watching someone grab a cup<br>and my real question was<br>what if those two things got to do with<br>each other and to a large extent the<br>people studying this stuff on the left<br>here the linguists went to separate<br>conferences and published in separate<br>journals from these neuroscientists who<br>studied sensory motor processing and<br>i was very interested in just bringing<br>these two fields of research that i<br>happened to know about i happened to<br>know about both of them i was very<br>interested in the overlaps between them<br>and my thought was that they really do<br>have deep connections between them<br>you know and potentially this is an<br>interesting new discovery about the<br>relationship between language and and<br>the processes that allow us to<br>experience the world<br>so i had this really detailed idea<br>which is this that the syntax of a<br>sentence that reports a concrete event<br>no matter what it is if it's the sort of<br>thing you can see or do<br>then that syntactic structure is<br>basically like a kind of trace or a<br>description of the sensory and the motor<br>processes that are involved and actually<br>experiencing that event and i'm not<br>going to spell that out in too much<br>detail because um that's not the purpose<br>of here but i just wanted to sort of<br>break it down a tiny bit so<br>when you grab a cup it feels like a big<br>continuous thing and when you watch me<br>grab a cup that also just feels like<br>something that just happens overnight<br>but really if you study the um the the<br>processes that are happening in the<br>brain you can kind of identify a<br>discrete sequence of processes or at<br>least that's what i was claiming and<br>there's several other suggestions along<br>those lines you can identify that this<br>happens then this and so for instance if<br>i'm watching someone grab a cup i can<br>say first of all i tend to them then i<br>attend to the cup then i monitor the<br>hand onto the cup or if i'm doing the<br>action myself i have to somehow attend<br>to myself as well as an agent as the<br>agent of the sentence i have to decide<br>that i'm going to act rather than watch<br>and then i have to attend the cut before<br>i reach for anything and so there's an<br>order there<br>and on the syntax side there's also a<br>kind of and basically the building<br>blocks over here are all the same sorts<br>of things<br>which in in cognitive science they call<br>direct operations which are operations<br>that are referring to the current focus<br>of attention or something like that<br>on the syntax side there's also this<br>interesting idea that any sentence is<br>broken up into basic building blocks and<br>the basic building block that i picked<br>up on in my uh account was called the<br>x-bar schema and so you can each one of<br>these squares is basically<br>like a lego piece that you plug together<br>in order to get the syntactic structure<br>of a sentence and my suggestion<br>was that<br>those<br>building blocks here correspond to the<br>direct operations inside here<br>and<br>from that idea<br>there is this deep connection between<br>sensory motor processes and uh syntactic<br>processes<br>there's this interesting insight that<br>you might sort of suggest about<br>how language evolved basically where did<br>language come from what was the<br>pre-adaptive platform of language and<br>the suggestion i made based on this kind<br>of close connection between language and<br>the sensory motor system was that maybe<br>language emerged as an adaptation of the<br>sensory motor system<br>so i developed that idea um<br>again kind of like mechanically um in an<br>actual implemented program with a<br>colleague luba binoskova<br>and her phd student martin takach who<br>became a very close collaborator of mine<br>and still is and we built a neural<br>network model of language learning that<br>drew on those ideas and and the model<br>basically to to kind of uh say it very<br>simply simulated what a baby has to do<br>um when she is learning her her native<br>language and she has to learn somehow<br>she has to experience events in the<br>world and those events have to be mapped<br>onto the utterances that she hears that<br>language speakers in her language<br>community<br>use to describe those events<br>and i won't go into any detail about<br>that but our network could learn lots of<br>languages with lots of different um<br>sentence structures and lots of<br>different orderings and lots of<br>interesting kind of syntactic phenomena<br>which i won't go into any any detail<br>here<br>so that was one thing i did in otago<br>another thing i did<br>which i described a little more quickly<br>um was modeling human machine dialogue<br>and again that that interest of mine<br>came from my interest in my phd at<br>edinburgh in in models of text coherence<br>so some forms of extended text are<br>monologues but other ones are dialogues<br>involving one or two or three more<br>people<br>and i built a dialogue system um in<br>partnership with te tumu which is the<br>school of maori studies and pacific<br>studies here at an indigenous studies<br>here at otago and also a little bit with<br>the higher education development center<br>here at otago and our project was um<br>done with my great collaborator peter<br>flugta but also some people uh at te<br>tumu um john moorefield at the bottom<br>there and uh craig hall and tory weather<br>all at the top and from hedc uh jenny<br>mcdonald who subsequently became my phd<br>student<br>and it was fantastic fun<br>to have the computer scientists uh um<br>like me and peter learn maori and to<br>teach the uh<br>the maori people something about<br>computer programming and so we could<br>work together it's extremely productive<br>um<br>program<br>program of research<br>and we built this really interesting<br>dialogue based tutoring system which was<br>deployed it was designed and deployed in<br>an introductory maori course that runs<br>here at otago called mari110 and it's<br>going to give you an example<br>of the english dialogue system<br>for speed basically<br>it's just something that allows you to<br>engage in a conversation with the system<br>and the idea was<br>that these conversations are a natural<br>way of<br>of helping a person who's learning a<br>language become fluent and in mari<br>there's this thing that often arises<br>where uh people who are married feel uh<br>shy to speak their own language or<br>on my as the word that's often used and<br>one of the thoughts we had for this<br>system was that if you can interact with<br>a bunch of computer characters to start<br>with that might help you overcome some<br>of your fakamar and help you use the<br>language with other people<br>so that was a very interesting project<br>but i'll move on while all this was<br>happening from the year 1998 to now<br>basically ai has been through this crazy<br>revolution and that's kind of like<br>another dimension of what's happening<br>here<br>um it's changed beyond recognition since<br>i came to otago even in that short time<br>um and that's why i have this word magic<br>in the title really these days ai<br>systems almost are so good that you<br>think what this is just like you know<br>it's indistinguishable from magic you<br>know lots of technology like that but ai<br>in particular because it simulates human<br>abilities<br>um<br>so anyway my students<br>they didn't initiate any of this<br>revolution but they were certainly<br>watching closely and i just wanted to<br>shout out to some of my students corin<br>he was one of the very earliest people<br>looking at the use of neural networks<br>inside statistical parsers<br>mike little he was one of the first<br>people to use the vector-based word<br>representations<br>that are now commonplace in all language<br>models um he was looking at joshua benji<br>of the pioneers work very soon after he<br>did that<br>hayden walls was uh using um<br>convolutional nets for latford um for<br>visual object classification very soon<br>after<br>well way before they became<br>fashionable i should say<br>and then a bunch of other students who<br>did work not um in language but on the<br>sensory motor side so motor cognition or<br>models of vision<br>and i want to call them all out as well<br>so the the final thing i'll talk about<br>um in terms of what i've been doing here<br>is this work that has already been<br>mentioned<br>with the the company's soul machines<br>so um<br>that company was started by this guy<br>mark sagar um and he was originally<br>someone who<br>worked in computer animation he built<br>models of faces that were incredibly<br>realistic and could pull extremely<br>realistic expressions and could um talk<br>very fluently<br>and um<br>he worked in hollywood special effects<br>basically and they still use a lot of<br>his<br>technologies in that field but he got<br>interested in moving beyond just face<br>animation to thinking about the brain<br>or the cognitive system that animates<br>the face and more broadly than that that<br>animates the whole body so he was very<br>interested in this idea that the brain<br>is um<br>embodied it sits inside a body that has<br>to interact with the world that's got a<br>face that can observe the world and and<br>the senses that can observe the world<br>and um<br>yeah he started building this<br>interesting model he came back to<br>university in otago in auckland um and<br>started working in his lab on building a<br>model of a baby<br>and then trying to teach the baby about<br>the world the physical world that the<br>baby finds herself in and also building<br>models of human dialogue systems using<br>grown-up faces like the one you see in<br>the bottom right there<br>so that was kind of too much of a<br>coincidence to be true it's like mark<br>when i first was interacting with him<br>and found out about he was saying i've<br>got this digital baby that needs a model<br>of the sensory motor system and also of<br>language learning and babies and also i<br>need a model of dialogue and i was like<br>well i can do all of that um<br>so uh so i joined seoul machines so<br>seoul machines was one of those projects<br>that started in the lab and was just too<br>good not to be taken up commercially and<br>so it was like venture capitalists were<br>all over this thing and um<br>so it was founded in 2016 and thank you<br>very much to the richards and to<br>michael albert who was hod at the time<br>you were all very enlightened about this<br>and said okay you take this commercial<br>contact and let's let's see what happens<br>with that and um and i came on board as<br>soon as it was founded and so did my<br>colleague martin takachu help me build<br>the neural network model<br>and right now<br>i mean the company is absolutely part of<br>the ai revolution it's uh it's just<br>the blue touch paper has been lit and<br>off it's gone it's like made you know<br>you know getting on 200 million dollars<br>in um new zealand dollars in in venture<br>capital funding it's got over 200 staff<br>it's got offices all over the world even<br>though these days people mostly work<br>from home um<br>so what am i doing up there i'm helping<br>to design the cognitive model that<br>animates these digital agents and that's<br>an incredibly interesting job<br>and i feel very lucky that i'm working<br>with a really interesting group of<br>people<br>so<br>some of these people are people who are<br>working on the cognitive modeling team<br>and ai team and<br>there's a mixture of<br>of old-fashioned ai people and then a<br>bunch of really keen new and extremely<br>talented um<br>people who work in the new ai the neural<br>network based ai<br>and then on top of that there's also a<br>group of people from the developmental<br>psychology group in auckland university<br>uh led by annette henderson<br>and if you're working on a digital baby<br>you need to know how real babies are and<br>so we have this incredibly interesting<br>academic kind of research interaction<br>with that group and i've put melee on<br>the end there mellie's not in seoul<br>machines officially but i spent a lot of<br>my time<br>bouncing my ideas about baby development<br>off her because that's her area of<br>research as well and so i very much feel<br>that she's part of this<br>so i've got a tiny demo it's a very<br>short demo uh it was made by one of our<br>own targo graduates uh josephine joseph<br>jefferson who is a neuroscience graduate<br>here but also did computer science and<br>this is an advertisement so this is a<br>model which has been built by many<br>people but she is the person who's<br>interacting with this baby and what<br>she's going to do is to move an object<br>on the screen and the baby's going to<br>watch it and that's event observation<br>and then<br>she's going to learn a word that<br>describes the object and then she's<br>going to do an action herself which is<br>event execution so just watch<br>hey baby<br>professor<br>okay<br>yeah that's right<br>nice work baby<br>put them on the duck yeah so that that's<br>baby that's just a tiny demonstration<br>baby eggs can do lots and lots of things<br>but i just want to give a very minimal<br>sort of round trip of the kind of things<br>okay so i'm also helping um<br>seoul machines develop its ethics policy<br>and<br>ai ethics is a huge area of course and<br>i'll talk a bit more about that in a<br>moment but for one of the reasons i<br>wanted to join this company was i'm very<br>interested in in ai ethics as many of<br>you<br>know and i felt that it was important to<br>be in industry thinking about ai ethics<br>rather than just sitting in academia<br>thinking about it because industry is<br>where<br>all the actual<br>developments happen and where stuff gets<br>deployed and so you want decisions about<br>ai ethics to be made in companies rather<br>than just be thought about in<br>universities<br>so i just mentioned a few things um<br>the the models that we build the systems<br>that we build um allow people to talk to<br>digital agents on the screen<br>and uh the digital agents are looking<br>with a camera at the person and<br>registering their expressions and the<br>emotional contours of their so there's a<br>lot of very private data there and it<br>seems super important uh to make sure<br>that soul machines doesn't become like a<br>company whose product has its data like<br>facebook is or like google is to some<br>extent these days as well<br>so um<br>when we were building the ai ethics<br>policy we built in various requirements<br>that data had to be kept genuinely<br>private and couldn't be uh<br>sold<br>which go beyond like the regulations of<br>the gdpr for instance<br>and predate the gb gdpr we also have<br>policies about who we're going to engage<br>with as clients we don't want to take on<br>anyone um<br>we have some<br>some policies there so for instance you<br>know tobacco or uh arms manufacturer we<br>don't want to go anywhere near that<br>stuff and you know there's lots of money<br>in some of those applications but we<br>don't want to go there<br>we also have some really interesting um<br>policies relating to<br>diversity of our digital agents and so<br>one of the really interesting things<br>about mark's face model or the face<br>model that's been developed in the<br>company now is it's extremely<br>parameterizable and so you can model<br>again what i would describe as a space<br>of possible faces just like a space of<br>possible texts i was talking about<br>before<br>and<br>this means that we have to kind of think<br>carefully about all sorts of issues to<br>do with diversity both in in terms of<br>ethnicity and also in terms of gender<br>and i've had some really useful feedback<br>and and comments uh from people here in<br>particular gareth<br>has been very helpful but we're trying<br>to think about these issues and do the<br>right thing um when we deploy these um<br>agents um commercially<br>so um<br>that brings me on this topic of ethics<br>to this kind of<br>the title of the talk defense against<br>the dark eyes<br>like ai is getting more and more<br>powerful and it's increasingly important<br>for us to think about how it should<br>properly be used and what constraints<br>should be put on it<br>um<br>and i spent a long time talking about<br>that with a bunch of people in the<br>computer science tea room and i have to<br>shout out my colleagues here these are<br>colleagues who are<br>particularly<br>fond of and i really really appreciate<br>these little chats that we've had<br>however<br>at a certain point after i vented my<br>concerns for quite a while about this<br>topic<br>my great friend and collaborator brennan<br>told me i can't remember the exact words<br>but along the lines of stop whinging<br>about it and do something about it<br>and uh and<br>that was a good little prompt that uh<br>that made me actually start some<br>projects in this area so that<br>was how the otago defense league was<br>born<br>and uh so this is this interpl<br>interdisciplinary group of uh<br>of<br>uh defense against the dark arts people<br>um we've got colin gavin from law uh<br>who's here and and uh<br>and uh james maclaurin who can't be here<br>that our thoughts are going out to james<br>but he can't be here today um but he's<br>from philosophy and he contributed a<br>sort of practical ethics component to<br>this which is super important<br>and so we've done all sorts of things we<br>started off by founding a discussion<br>group and<br>this discussion group was intended to be<br>extremely broad and go right across<br>departments in the university and we had<br>people not just from from philosophy and<br>from law<br>but from economics and management and<br>marketing and and psychology and<br>tourism and and many many other places<br>um information science of course<br>although that's uh<br>wildly different from computer science<br>of course you know that<br>um<br>so i i felt when we ran this group there<br>i really felt for the first time that i<br>was in a university rather than just a<br>department because we had discussions<br>with people from all over the university<br>and the nature of ai impacts and ai<br>ethics is that it's incredibly<br>interdisciplinary and there's no way<br>around you need discussion involving<br>many many people from many different<br>areas of expertise and we really felt<br>that we<br>had this interesting group of people<br>here<br>at otago<br>so that led into a very interesting<br>project that uh that colin applied for<br>from the new zealand law foundation um<br>and that ran for three years and we did<br>some very interesting work relating to<br>ai and the law<br>in new zealand so i had a new zealand<br>focus and we were extremely lucky to<br>have two fantastic researchers uh john's<br>really and joy liddercote<br>who are probably online<br>so yeah so big ups to them<br>and i won't talk too much about what we<br>did um<br>but we you know the whole of ai ethics<br>for me is all about sort of worries you<br>need to articulate certain worries and<br>make sure things are all right so one of<br>the questions that we thought about was<br>how should governments use ai systems or<br>machine learning systems um<br>predictive models that kind of stuff and<br>we were focusing on new zealand so we<br>think about new zealand government<br>departments<br>and we came up with all sorts of<br>recommendations but one common idea was<br>that there should be cop they're sort of<br>like common standards for for use of<br>predictive models you know which<br>encompasses old-fashioned statistical<br>models and more sort of flashy modern um<br>and neural network models too deep<br>learning models<br>and we wanted to make sure that there<br>was auditing in areas related to bias<br>and transparency and also this more<br>less commonly studied one of human<br>control<br>is the person who's using this model<br>really aware of what's going on or are<br>they just on autopilot so we wanted to<br>make sure that was part of the um<br>the question that was discussed in<br>audits<br>then another topic we thought about is<br>another of these worries that people<br>have about ai what's ai going to do to<br>our jobs is it going to take all our<br>jobs what's going to happen to work<br>human work how's that's going to change<br>and so on that one we were thinking<br>about ai systems that were used all over<br>the uh<br>the work cycle so partly to do with<br>recruitment ai systems take the the job<br>of<br>taking all the cvs and skimming through<br>them and producing a long list for you<br>they even do some early kind of<br>interviewing so uh that's one thing it's<br>like is that okay<br>do we want ai systems to be involved in<br>helping us choose is there issues with<br>bias that might arise there how can you<br>audit that how can you check<br>um then another thing is that a lot of<br>jobs these days you might actually say<br>that the employees are managed by ai<br>systems or at least by algorithms like<br>in the gig economy like uber for<br>instance uber drivers get sent somewhere<br>not by a human manager they they're<br>allocated tasks and jobs by a computer<br>and then the computer obvious is also<br>involved in evaluating how well they're<br>performing so is that stressful to be<br>evaluated by<br>a machine rather than a person is that<br>kind of degrading to the dignity of<br>workers in any way<br>so that was another question<br>and we're also interested more broadly<br>in the impacts of ai on consumers and on<br>society so that was another topic<br>and i'll conclude um oh so yeah and as<br>part of that uh law project um we found<br>we founded this center for ai and public<br>policy here at otago and it really has<br>been quite a focus not just within otago<br>but more broadly in new zealand<br>and i hope that will continue<br>and we also had an impact on the<br>government in a few ways and the most<br>kind of like sort of concrete one was<br>this algorithm charter uh that was<br>produced in in 2020 um<br>where the report that we wrote was kind<br>of a founding document behind this and<br>it's one of the first<br>um sort of<br>charters for how to use um predictive<br>models uh that's intended to apply to<br>all government departments right across<br>government so it's quite an<br>innovative thing<br>and we also produced a book um which was<br>uh the uh the main running on this was<br>done by john for really our postdoc uh<br>but we were all involved and it's an<br>interesting kind of way of of offering<br>advice to citizens about ai and the<br>thought and and the issues that arise<br>that people need to think about because<br>we want the discussion about these uh<br>questions about impacts of ai not just<br>to happen within this industry or in<br>universities but in the community more<br>broadly so we intended to produce<br>something and we've done quite a lot of<br>this outreach type stuff<br>finally i'll talk about one other<br>project that's taking a lot of my time<br>at the moment which is to do with social<br>media and the governance of social media<br>i'm this is a project that's quite<br>international so it's not just new<br>zealand anymore and social media<br>companies are like big targets big<br>multinational targets and so you need<br>big uh um sort of consortia of people<br>who are thinking about how to um to<br>regulate<br>those companies and again it has to be<br>widely interdisciplinary so down here<br>we've got lawyers uh people who<br>specialize in ai and law um uh down the<br>bottom here these are some of common<br>students and one of them i<br>supervised as well and then we've got a<br>bunch of ai people including some quite<br>heavy hitters we've got stuart russell<br>here um yeah we've got ricardo baeza<br>yates over here so um this is quite a uh<br>a high level um<br>project in some ways and it's got quite<br>a lot of attention internationally and<br>i've just finished just by concluding by<br>just describing some of the things that<br>are coming up in this project so<br>the project is um all about the ai<br>systems that social media companies use<br>to choose what you see in your feed like<br>when you open facebook you get this feed<br>of items it's personalized to you right<br>um and what what's happened is that some<br>ai system in facebook has learned the<br>kind of things that you like and that<br>keep you on the platform and it gives<br>you more of that stuff basically so this<br>is an ai system that's in wide wide use<br>you know it's<br>all over the place and it's having huge<br>impacts but we don't really know what<br>those impacts are so talk about dark<br>arts<br>um this is really the dark<br>and um<br>what we're interested in doing here is<br>trying to bring some light into this<br>area and try to find ways that companies<br>can<br>can show the effects of these systems on<br>users there's lots of people who try to<br>study these effects<br>from<br>from the outside but we're interested in<br>having companies themselves using their<br>most powerful method their more powerful<br>methods work out in particular whether<br>there's any tenancy which is something<br>that people often think about and you<br>often see in the in the media is there<br>any tendency for these algorithms to<br>push people in the direction of harmful<br>content for instance towards extremism<br>or towards polarization<br>and companies haven't as yet<br>really engaged with that question but<br>they could so our project's all about<br>trying to<br>interact with companies<br>pre-legislatively you know before<br>there's any rules about this to try and<br>design sensible rules about how they can<br>be transparent about that question<br>um<br>anyway i think that's it for me uh<br>enough from the defense league um i just<br>want to say thank you to otago and this<br>is my final thought i i<br>remember when i first arrived here<br>having done all these interesting uh<br>like undergrad post-grad<br>post-doc stuff it was all very nice but<br>coming to otago i felt this enormous<br>freedom i really felt a sense of freedom<br>it's like<br>you have the freedom of academia you can<br>decide what you want to study what<br>questions you find are interesting and i<br>really appreciate the freedom that i've<br>been given here at otago not only to do<br>ai but also the freedom to be a little<br>critical about the discipline and<br>and think about how it should be limited<br>or constrained<br>so anyway that's that's uh that's the<br>end of my lecture thank you very much<br>uh thank you ellie um so<br>it's up to me to do the outro which i<br>was told is the most difficult thing but<br>um i have<br>in my mind a sort of model of an ideal<br>academic and i just wanted to take a<br>little bit of time to measure ally<br>against<br>that model<br>so number one<br>is of my ideal academic is that they<br>have this single-minded devotion<br>to<br>one or two<br>basic questions i guess and ellie<br>mentioned it in the talk he said he<br>spent 14 years<br>thinking about a man grabs a cup<br>so i think that's a pretty<br>deep<br>single-minded devotion so he's spent<br>basically his whole career thinking<br>about two things<br>one is how the brain works<br>and how can we simulate that and more<br>recently is what do we do when we figure<br>that stuff out and how do we control<br>the machines that we create<br>um and<br>um<br>so i think on this score the<br>single-minded devotion and he's really<br>focused on this the whole time<br>i give him a sustained outstanding<br>and what comes after that is really an<br>ability to talk about your research<br>which ellie can do at length<br>in excruciating detail<br>day after day after day<br>at morning tea um and so i can give him<br>a sustained outstanding leadership and<br>contribution on that score as well<br>um<br>criteria for my ideal academic is<br>absent-mindedness<br>um<br>we walked over i walked over with ellie<br>um earlier we were in the there's a<br>green room<br>back here i never knew<br>and we're standing in the green room and<br>the lecture theater technician came up<br>and said oh<br>ellie can i grab your device and i'll<br>connect it up and make sure<br>it's all working and ali<br>did i leave it in your office brendan<br>when i came and got you i don't<br>remember oh<br>actually i don't think i brought it at<br>all<br>so<br>we now got 10 minutes to go<br>he doesn't have his computer<br>so he runs<br>back to his office<br>picks it up and runs back<br>um sweating<br>and then dons his robes<br>so on absent-mindedness<br>i also give ellie<br>a sustained outstanding<br>um<br>leadership<br>and competence<br>and the last one is<br>a questionable dress sense<br>and i'm just going to leave that<br>so and now of course the title professor<br>is reserved<br>for you know people who meet these<br>criteria with the highest standards and<br>i'm pleased that<br>very pleased that ali's title is
