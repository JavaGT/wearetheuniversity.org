like<br>to now um give a warm welcome to dr john<br>williams who is the director of the<br>bachelor of entrepreneurship<br>and his research includes consumer<br>behavior tourism business ethics social<br>marketing and also how business and<br>societies work together so i'll hand it<br>over to dr john williams<br>thank you<br>uh<br>call john williams<br>as you've just learned um a quick<br>so i know i don't look very brown<br>but<br>i do uh i do hail from um uh from<br>uh kaffir which is um just south of<br>raglan uh for those of you who don't<br>know kathia so that's where my ancestry<br>lies<br>anyhow<br>so<br>i'm here to tell you about the bachelor<br>of entrepreneurship which is the first<br>new bachelor's degree that's been<br>offered by otago for over a hundred<br>years<br>so we're quite we're quite excited about<br>that<br>so what i want to do is i i don't plan<br>to take very long i<br>basically want to run over what makes<br>the degree different and why it's suited<br>to people<br>who want to be entrepreneurs<br>when we were launching the degree<br>uh we carefully considered um<br>uh<br>if<br>the um a university education was not<br>appealing to some people uh who wanted<br>to be entrepreneurs who could benefit<br>from it um but they because they were<br>entrepreneurial uh they were considering<br>uh perhaps going to polytech or maybe<br>not<br>undertaking any tertiary education<br>whatsoever and going straight into<br>business so we did<br>consider that that aspect of it and so<br>the design goals of the degree were to<br>make it uh as useful and practical and<br>flexible<br>as possible<br>so what i mean by flexible uh is that if<br>you want to go into a bachelor's degree<br>and you have to<br>every other bachelor's degree except<br>this one<br>you have to major in something<br>so for example if you want to do a<br>bachelor of science and you want to<br>major in physics<br>uh<br>there are 13 prescribed papers<br>so that<br>i mean that's a good thing if you want<br>to learn a deep knowledge of a<br>particular subject area<br>other people their life goals<br>they might not want to be particularly<br>specialist in something they might want<br>a broader knowledge<br>so that's particularly true of<br>entrepreneurs so no one actually just<br>wants to be an entrepreneur per se they<br>want to be entrepreneurial about<br>something so they might have an idea<br>for for sustainability<br>they might have an idea for<br>farm technology agricultural technology<br>for example<br>so in order to actually launch their<br>business they have to learn a little bit<br>about well how do you launch a business<br>and how do you go from a start-up to an<br>actual stable ongoing business<br>but also<br>if you want to<br>innovate<br>or just create a new business<br>and food tech for example you probably<br>want to learn a bit about food science<br>and perhaps some microbiology and<br>chemistry as well<br>so we've tried to create the degree the<br>structure of the degree<br>so that not only can you learn about<br>entrepreneurship as a subject but you<br>can also learn about<br>those knowledge areas and skill areas<br>that you want to be entrepreneurial in<br>so what that means is that there are<br>only six prescribed papers<br>as opposed to 13 in physics so that<br>leaves<br>leaves space free in the degree<br>for students to learn about<br>food technology or agriculture or<br>information and communication technology<br>or data science<br>which is going to be our next talk<br>so it leaves space in the degree to<br>learn<br>about all those things<br>so how it works is that um every year uh<br>there are<br>two compulsory entrepreneurship papers<br>uh there's one per semester so in the<br>first semester it's more or less a<br>traditional<br>lecture and tutorial assignment<br>type of university paper<br>in the second semester it's what we call<br>field work<br>and that's where you put the theory that<br>you learned in semester one into<br>practice<br>so every year theory and semester one<br>field work and semester two<br>so there's a theory paper and semester<br>one and year one two and three<br>there's a field work paper and semester<br>two in year one two and three<br>uh in the field work and<br>first year we get the<br>students to do the audacious program<br>which is basically<br>taking students<br>to develop a business idea and go<br>through to actually launching that<br>business if they in fact choose to do<br>that<br>uh in year two and semester two we get<br>students to take part in our in the<br>ignite consultants<br>which is a student-led business<br>consultant um consortium<br>that um only takes not-for-profit<br>businesses<br>um so their mission uh they have a<br>social mission uh to help<br>not-for-profits uh succeed uh in there<br>to achieve their goals<br>um so<br>so you go from in year one develop your<br>own business and year two<br>help someone else's business and but<br>we're using business in the loosest<br>sense here so within the bachelor of<br>entrepreneurship and also in the otago<br>business school<br>we recognize that not all businesses are<br>profit maximizers<br>some are of course<br>some business owners have different<br>goals other than profit maximization<br>including social goals they might want<br>to run an organization to achieve some<br>socially desirable outcome<br>so we want we want to help with that<br>so uh<br>we call it the backer of<br>entrepreneurship there is also um<br>some of you may be familiar with the<br>term entrepreneurship<br>so that's innovating within an existing<br>organization<br>and we know<br>our business school has a<br>an advisory board who are made up of the<br>top level business leaders around new<br>zealand who are most of whom are<br>graduates of otago<br>and what they're telling us is that<br>big businesses know uh and medium-sized<br>businesses know that business as usual<br>uh isn't cutting it uh in um in many<br>situations and entrepreneurial thinking<br>is actually needed so even when within<br>large organizations say fonterra for<br>example uh they really value uh<br>entrepreneurial thinking uh we we just<br>call that entrepreneurship<br>uh and then there's also a strong focus<br>of the degree is social entrepreneurship<br>uh as i've already discussed<br>so that's 100 level you work on your own<br>business 200 level you help someone<br>else's not-for-profit business<br>and then at 300 level we get students to<br>embed in one of the local um<br>accelerators or incubators so there what<br>you're doing is you're helping lots of<br>other uh<br>business entrepreneurs<br>um<br>so there's that development<br>and the basically the more business<br>problems that you're exposed to as a<br>student and trying to help someone as a<br>as a consultant uh the deeper<br>understanding you get of the realities<br>of entrepreneurship<br>so that's the basic plan uh so there's<br>um three uh<br>six compulsory papers three theory three<br>field work and and then at 300 level uh<br>students have to do two additional<br>papers uh from a list of eight papers<br>um so ranging from um<br>understanding ecological issues to new<br>product development so there's there's<br>an option there for a wide range of<br>taste<br>and interests<br>um so i mentioned<br>at the start if you do a ba or a b com<br>or a bsc<br>you have to major in something and the<br>biantra you don't have to major in<br>anything<br>so that's<br>the reason why we made that choice is to<br>make the degree maximally flexible<br>you can take a major if you want to but<br>it's optional<br>the biantra although it's housed in the<br>otago business school we think of it as<br>not being a commerce degree but<br>basically being a university-wide degree<br>so you can actually take a major you can<br>enroll in the bachelor of<br>entrepreneurship<br>and major in biochemistry if you wanted<br>to or food science or geography or<br>geology<br>whatever you want to<br>innovate in and be entrepreneurial in<br>that domain that subject domain area we<br>want to leave space not only for<br>students to learn but actually to gain<br>some sort of recognized qualification<br>so you can say in their academic<br>transcript they can say that they<br>majored in food science<br>another<br>design goal and<br>fundamental principle when we're<br>described<br>constructing the degree was honoring the<br>treaty<br>so<br>uh our we in the business school we have<br>uh associate dean uh academy sorry<br>academic deans uh<br>uh<br>uh that cover uh<br>maori and pacific and the academic<br>beings of maori and pacific<br>were<br>were heavily involved with creating the<br>degree<br>and remain<br>as academic oversight so<br>because it's a new degree we're<br>we're examining very closely how it's<br>going and if it's succeeding in its<br>goals<br>another one of the goals um<br>which is a little unusual<br>is we really want to develop students as<br>individuals<br>and develop their personal qualities<br>vis-a-vis entrepreneurship<br>so<br>one of the<br>people who are the academic leads in<br>developing the degree is professor<br>nathan berg he's the dunedin city<br>council chair and entrepreneurship<br>so he's developed a psychometric<br>tool called ecat<br>to measure<br>individuals entrepreneurial capital<br>and that's been ecat has been used by<br>various organizations and ministries in<br>new zealand<br>uh so what we've got what we plan to do<br>is when students enroll in their first<br>year we give them that ecat<br>questionnaire<br>and then we re-test them as they go on<br>uh to see uh that's one way we can see<br>if we're achieving our<br>aims<br>of developing the students as<br>individuals rather than testing their<br>knowledge what the knowledge and skills<br>they've picked up<br>and<br>i see there's a question in the chat<br>i'll<br>get to that<br>so<br>so we've got uh<br>the<br>maori pacific and other indigenous<br>perspectives that kind of baked into the<br>degree into the topics we teach in the<br>way that we teach them<br>um<br>and<br>and also the the practical focus of the<br>degree<br>um so<br>field work and putting theory into<br>practice<br>um<br>uh and so those those two<br>um<br>perspectives on teaching and learning i<br>suppose they give rise to another<br>phenomenon or another aspect of the<br>degree there's no exams we don't have<br>any exams so we're not so much about<br>getting students to regurgitate<br>information although<br>university exams don't only do that and<br>we try to assess understanding obviously<br>but to<br>developing skills and developing<br>entrepreneurial capital so a key aspect<br>of entrepreneurial capital is pitching<br>for example<br>so the ability to<br>confidently interact to ask for money<br>and and to back up your claims<br>so uh yeah so this is<br>we<br>we have similar tasks over the course of<br>a paper and also the course of the<br>degree<br>so<br>if you think about coaching<br>and developing a student as a sport in<br>the sport for example you can't give<br>someone coaching tips and then<br>see how they run down the track or throw<br>a shop or something and that's it it's<br>continual practice<br>so that continual practice and coaching<br>is really built into<br>how we've structured the assessment of<br>the degree so the topics we teach how we<br>assess them and how we teach those<br>i think that i've got a list of things<br>i'm a very forgetful person so i've got<br>a list of things that i wanted to cover<br>um<br>that's pretty much all of them i think<br>so<br>i can get on to answering the question<br>so this question in the chat would it be<br>helpful for students who are seeking a<br>with the degree would be helpful for<br>anything<br>where students want to develop a<br>business including their own personal<br>brand<br>we don't actually so in the marketing<br>department where i work we do have a<br>sport marketing paper uh and uh personal<br>branding so this<br>sports person as a brand uh is an<br>so<br>we aim to yeah yeah so we aim to be as i<br>say as as open and possible so pretty<br>much anything that you can study at<br>university<br>you can include in your bachelor of<br>entrepreneurship degree<br>um and uh and any major that you get at<br>otago university you can can actually<br>include that<br>um okay that's that's pretty much all i<br>want to say um i've got a lecture at<br>noon<br>so i can hang around for another five or<br>ten minutes um so either in question or<br>do you have some examples of current<br>student projects um no we don't actually<br>um well i i i'm the administr of<br>administrator of the entire degree<br>i don't actually teach<br>a significant portion of any of the<br>papers i did because i<br>work in the marketing department i gave<br>two lectures on marketing for entre 101<br>so the first year paper is still ongoing<br>uh if you're actually interested i can<br>obtain that list from our course leader<br>so as an example of our commitment to<br>tetheriti<br>we actually specifically hired a maori<br>academic<br>to teach<br>the first year papers uh his name's<br>morgan godfrey uh and he's um<br>an amazing person uh we're very very<br>lucky to have him uh so that's uh so<br>i'll um get a hold of morgan and see if<br>i can uh share that that list for you<br>with you<br>thank you john um i just wanted to ask a<br>couple of questions so<br>obviously um with course planning we had<br>lots of students interested in<br>entrepreneurship<br>and because it's it's first it's in its<br>first year are you able to give us some<br>idea of how many students<br>you've got in the program this year<br>yep um just over 100<br>which exceeded their wildest dreams<br>we were planning for about 40.<br>about about half of those bachelor of<br>entrepreneurship students excuse me at<br>the moment<br>just recovering from the flu<br>uh yeah half are are enrolled in the<br>bachelor of entrepreneurship<br>and the other half are enrolled in other<br>bachelor's degrees and they just think<br>entrepreneur 101 looks like a good paper<br>to include in their degree<br>and actually as we're coming um this is<br>the second last week of the semester<br>i've had a trickle of enquiries from<br>students who want to change from a bsc<br>to a biantra so they've enrolled in<br>ultra 101<br>or they've got a friend who's taken the<br>paper yeah and they yeah so that that's<br>um<br>administratively very tricky<br>uh but our um our whole ethos is<br>flexibility and not putting artificial<br>barriers uh in the way<br>awesome and i must say that's um being<br>feedback you know from students and<br>parents they love the flexibility of the<br>degree<br>so um so that's really good to hear<br>because we weren't too sure i remember<br>you telling us only 40 spaces but we<br>knew you'd get a few more numbers than<br>that um<br>yeah also just another one just in<br>regards to your um you know how you<br>talked about the theory and practical<br>papers<br>are there existing relationships with<br>organizations in dunedin community with<br>businesses that um absolutely<br>we try and make sure we can deliver what<br>we promise so we uh we do have<br>memorandums of understanding uh with uh<br>some of the local uh not all but most of<br>the local innovators<br>uh uh and sorry innovators uh incubators<br>and accelerators uh here in dunedin<br>under the startup dunedin umbrella<br>yeah so<br>they've<br>they've agreed to take uh take our<br>students<br>uh it looks like we're going to end up<br>with more than they agreed to take but<br>they've agreed that in principle<br>uh they can work with that um well one<br>thing i forgot to mention actually is<br>that um<br>at each of the years so we've got year<br>one audacious year two ignite<br>year three embedding in an incubator<br>if at any stage a student<br>can make a case uh to me<br>that<br>they don't need that<br>and they've got another<br>context or situation where they can put<br>into practice what they've learned in<br>the first semester we're certainly<br>willing to accommodate that<br>so that's particularly relevant<br>for the<br>secondary school students have compute<br>completed the yes program<br>so that is very similar to audacious<br>and actually<br>of<br>of the hundred students that are 100-ish<br>103 i think students that are enrolled<br>about six are have actually launched<br>their own business and they are actually<br>running their own business which they<br>developed from the yes program so<br>audacious is kind of pointless for them<br>so we're going to try and work out<br>something where they can um<br>meaningfully<br>show that they've<br>learnt the principles and semester one<br>and can apply them in their own business<br>awesome thank you and just one last<br>question here are you looking to cap<br>numbers in the first year if it<br>continues to grow um we might have to um<br>staffing is an issue uh to be brutally<br>honest<br>um<br>and it may be um that we may have to<br>uh but we're going to avoid that for as<br>long as humanly possible uh basically if<br>our numbers grow we can make a business<br>case to hire new staff so it's a sort of<br>um yes that's uh<br>no that's awesome it's a good thing it's<br>a good problem to have if we're getting<br>more numbers so yeah yes that's what<br>you're saying i mean good um students<br>interested in studying that so no i i if<br>there's no more questions i'll leave it<br>there um because you've got to run to<br>your lecture so thank you for your time<br>it was very interesting and um yeah<br>you're welcome curacao you're welcome<br>awesome<br>okay so now moving along we've got about<br>another 20 minutes left so i just wanted<br>to introduce our next speaker associate<br>professor tony savadimo i hope i've said<br>that right tony<br>just a little bit of background<br>uh tony lectures and also coordinates<br>the computer 101 paper<br>which is the introductory paper in<br>information science and his background<br>is working as a software engineer and<br>also a lecturer so welcome tony thank<br>you i'll pass it over to you<br>right yeah thank you teddies um<br>so um hello from me um i'm tony<br>and i am an associate professor as teres<br>said<br>the department of information science<br>and um<br>um i'm originally from from india and i<br>moved to dunedin 20 years ago to do my<br>phd and i thought i'll be here for three<br>years and the three years have now grown<br>to 20 years<br>um i really love being in dunedin and<br>and also um doing research um and<br>publishing um<br>so today i'm going to talk about the new<br>miner that's being offered at the<br>business school which is the<br>business analytics minor but before we<br>talk about the minor<br>i briefly wanted to say a few things<br>about<br>my research because<br>i'm passionate about my research and it<br>directly links to<br>the kind of<br>activities we do in the data science<br>domain<br>so i conduct research in a couple of<br>domains one is multi-agent systems which<br>is a branch of distributed artificial<br>intelligence<br>and the other branch is software<br>engineering and you might wonder what<br>does these branches have to do with data<br>science<br>hang on a minute i will tell you um<br>so what is agent an agent is in um it's<br>a piece of software that can actually<br>reside in<br>um embedded systems like robotic systems<br>and virtual worlds and i'm more<br>interested in social aspect of<br>these systems how can we actually make<br>these robotic systems collide<br>collaborate virtual avatars collaborate<br>with each other and so on and in<br>software engineering i'm interested in<br>social aspects of software engineering<br>such as<br>decision making systems and um<br>and also investigating whether software<br>developers really have a life<br>because some some of you might know<br>software developers can work for a long<br>period of time um you know are they<br>really um disconnecting themselves from<br>work and having a really meaningful life<br>or not so we look at for example their<br>twitter feed um to find out whether they<br>actually talk about work or are they<br>really you know socializing with other<br>people so what i'm going to do today is<br>i'm going to<br>link my research areas to the data<br>science<br>umbrella which is the larger umbrella of<br>what i'm going to talk about so a couple<br>of examples from um my own research on<br>analytics then i'm going to post your<br>question because i've been asked to<br>um<br>you know<br>make make it as interactive as possible<br>so i'll i'll post you a very brief<br>question it will be easy one i promise<br>and then i'm going to talk about the<br>business analytics minor and you can ask<br>me um questions<br>so when you look at this particular<br>picture we could see a couple of robots<br>and<br>i'm actually passionate about creating<br>software for these robots where the goal<br>is to make them socially capable so when<br>you look at this picture you could<br>actually see there are quite a few<br>social norms in action<br>so you can see one robot gazes at the<br>other other robot<br>and in human systems when we actually<br>talk to somebody we don't constantly<br>stare at each other we<br>we look at somebody for a certain amount<br>of time and then we<br>turn our gaze somewhere else<br>so there is a gaze norm here right<br>how does this robot know<br>how how long<br>it should actually look at the other<br>person in the eye and it also is<br>actually shaking the hand right so the<br>handshake is just a cultural norm in the<br>western societies but if you're like me<br>from from india you would say namaste or<br>vanakkam<br>or you know if you're from china you<br>know you bow so the norms change and you<br>may also observe that it's an<br>interpersonal distance between these two<br>robots so the main thing i want to bring<br>up here is<br>the robots have to learn from humans and<br>in my research we are interested in<br>learning social norms socially<br>acceptable behavior and this comes from<br>learning from humans<br>so these robots are highly<br>perceptive they can actually look at the<br>environment when you're speaking to each<br>other we only focus on the other person<br>but these robots can actually look at<br>the whole room and learn from a whole<br>heap of people in the room um so not<br>just from one<br>one other robot so here i'm interested<br>in learning from humans so it's learning<br>from data there's a lot of data that<br>comes into the robot and i'm interested<br>in learning social behavior and this<br>becomes very important in the context of<br>human robot teams so nowadays there are<br>lots of for example firefighting is a<br>common example where robots and humans<br>work together and these robots shouldn't<br>ask how to behave to a human all the<br>time they should learn it automatically<br>so it comes from huge amounts of data<br>the second example from my own research<br>is<br>checking for process compliance<br>so process compliance is<br>about checking whether certain processes<br>the organizations say that they follows<br>actually being<br>conformed to so this is a process on the<br>left this is an advertised process that<br>is shown to be<br>useful this is the advertised process<br>in in the python language development<br>when people want to develop the python<br>language it's it's developed um in a<br>distributed manner and when somebody<br>wants to create a new functionality they<br>create a document<br>the document goes through this process<br>initially the feature is it's it's<br>advertised as a draft and then it gets<br>accepted by several people and then<br>finally gets implemented so this is the<br>process that they say that they follow<br>but when we look at the real data<br>it's quite complex so what you can see<br>on the right is the actual process you<br>can see it is much more complicated so<br>this again<br>is an example where we can look at the<br>data that is present and then you can<br>check whether the advertised process is<br>in fact the actual process so what we<br>found was the actual process is much<br>more complicated so this again comes<br>from a data driven perspective so if we<br>look at the real data the real data<br>tells us things are slightly different<br>so another<br>example is driverless cars when you<br>think of cars<br>these these cars do only three things<br>you know<br>the cars can accelerate the cars can<br>break and they can turn so to do these<br>three things they use<br>a huge amount of data from video cameras<br>the gps the lidar system<br>and they track each of the other cars in<br>the other lanes uniquely to make<br>these three simple decisions turning<br>braking and accelerating<br>so now we have a question so what's<br>common<br>to these three examples that i've<br>presented so if you can actually use<br>your<br>the chat system to post answers so i'll<br>give you 15 seconds it's not it's not a<br>tricky question<br>so<br>what do these three<br>okay<br>people learning from humans<br>data input is needed<br>yes those are all good answers<br>yes they have to learn from<br>process or information human requirement<br>but so those are all um<br>very good answers<br>so my answer is<br>all these three examples<br>require huge amounts of data<br>and it involves certain form of<br>analytics so there is an underlying<br>analytics program or some<br>analytics method um or technique that's<br>actually used to infer insights from<br>data so that forms the nice segue to<br>what i want to present which is<br>the new miner<br>which which is going to be introduced in<br>2023 which is on<br>business analytics so business analytics<br>focuses on a specific aspect of<br>analytics so analytics is a broad<br>subject<br>and data analytics is a common broad<br>umbrella<br>but in business analytics we are<br>interested in inferring insights from<br>business data so the examples the three<br>examples that i gave were all examples<br>of business analytics<br>so the motivation for this miner comes<br>from businesses um gaining a lot of data<br>so the last 10 to 15 years<br>organizations are collecting huge<br>amounts of information from their<br>customers suppliers products<br>processes and so on and you would have<br>heard about this term called big data<br>which means huge amounts of data in<br>petabytes and zettabytes and this was<br>popularized by um this article in the<br>economist<br>which talked about the data deluge the<br>flooding of data and um not all data<br>would be useful we need to do some<br>meaningful processing to get the golden<br>nuggets so um so this in this particular<br>picture um<br>the the plant is growing uh because of<br>this golden nugget or the key insights<br>that can be from the data so all of this<br>data needs to be<br>and there is a lot of demand for<br>analytics both globally and in the new<br>zealand context so one thing i want to<br>highlight is this third code which comes<br>from infometrics infometrics or all the<br>time in the in the in the news<br>and they have noted that um it is<br>important for commerce graduates in<br>particular to have extensive analytic<br>skills um so it's not just sufficient<br>for them to have um<br>just data literacy<br>they want graduates<br>that have extensive analytic skills and<br>this particular minor<br>aims to bridge bridge that gap<br>and you may wonder<br>what does analytics involve um sorry for<br>turning this into analytics 101 but i<br>thought it'd be good to<br>hear a few things about what analytics<br>is all about it's about this particular<br>pipeline that i have shown in this graph<br>typically huge amounts of data is<br>available<br>the first step involves the importing of<br>the data bringing up the data into a<br>particular platform this could be excel<br>it could be in the modern context it<br>could be the r programming language or a<br>python programming language so we import<br>the data and the data is often unclean<br>it's noisy data so we need to tidy tidy<br>the data then we do some transformation<br>this is the slicing and dicing of data<br>transformation of data and then we look<br>at visualizing the data<br>into the graphs the various form of<br>graphs bar charts um trend lines and so<br>on and at the heart of analytics lies<br>this model building so model building is<br>a key component of analytics where we<br>create predictive models for example<br>whether a loan will be approved or not<br>or whether can we detect diabetes in the<br>early stages so those all involve<br>creating some mathematical or<br>statistical models and often this is an<br>iterative process and once we build a<br>good model then that model results can<br>be communicated to various stakeholders<br>and very briefly there are these three<br>types of analytics<br>which we cover as a part of this minor<br>descriptive predictive and prescriptive<br>so descriptive is all about looking at<br>historical data<br>and identifying various trends for<br>example<br>the trend here shows<br>the sales was weak in march you know so<br>these are<br>based on past<br>data<br>like those things and the notices about<br>like<br>the predictive analytics is all about<br>forward looking can we actually predict<br>something yes you need to go and see<br>so down the hallway and turn around<br>everybody sorry that's me sorry sorry<br>okay<br>no that's okay and the third type is the<br>prescriptive analytics and um so this<br>diagram nicely summarizes<br>uh the continuum of analytics so the the<br>easiest thing to do is the descriptive<br>analytics so i'm sure all of us here<br>would have created bar charts and line<br>charts right so that's the that's<br>actually looking at past data and<br>creating visualizations but<br>the difficulty level increases as we<br>move to predictive analytics and<br>prescriptive analytics<br>so predictive analytics is all about<br>what will you know what will happen in<br>in the future and prescriptive is all<br>about<br>looking at a slightly distant past sorry<br>future and then creating pathways to<br>achieve a particular goal okay<br>so the descriptive analytics might tell<br>us okay the sales is low and then<br>diagnostic diagnostic analytics can tell<br>us the reason for why the sales is low<br>for example covered is a very good<br>reason right we can actually<br>again create a chart that shows<br>covered versus no core with scenario you<br>know covered as a reason for um<br>the lower sales and predicted analytics<br>is all about can we actually now predict<br>whatever sales will look like in a<br>year's time or in six months time<br>with and without go with scenarios and<br>prescriptive analytics is actually<br>looking into the future saying if you<br>want to achieve 50 increase in sales<br>what are the different pathways and what<br>is the best pathway to achieve<br>a particular goal<br>so i won't go into a lot of detail<br>because um<br>it can be laborious<br>so one one good example of predictive<br>analytics is loan processing and i think<br>most of us would have been in a<br>situation where we have applied for a<br>loan home loan personal loan<br>but an interesting fact is that<br>most loans are not processed by humans<br>it's processed by an analytics program<br>it's often a machine learning program<br>and that program is an algorithm that<br>takes a huge amount of information about<br>individuals the age gender education<br>income and so on and then it builds a<br>prediction model based on<br>past data about customers so it creates<br>a mathematical model and then we apply<br>for a loan<br>that program takes in our data and then<br>makes a prediction so<br>um whether to approve the loan or not<br>and this prediction is given to a human<br>who rely who relays that information so<br>it's actually a scary proposition that<br>nowadays most decisions in many<br>organizations are<br>um created by this analytics<br>program but um there is a lot of<br>research that goes in the creation of<br>these analytics programs so that they're<br>not biased for example there's a lot of<br>work that shows um you know there is<br>bias<br>across races for example there are<br>algorithms that can be racist for<br>example<br>so there's a huge amount of<br>research that goes um<br>in the predictive analytics<br>field<br>and moving beyond predictive analytics<br>is the prescriptive analytics where we<br>can actually prescribe a solution so i<br>won't go over all these examples i'll<br>just take one example which is customer<br>churn prevention so organizations do not<br>want their customers to leave they want<br>customers to be with them so the first<br>step to prevent<br>these churn is to identify customers who<br>are at risk uh in leaving an<br>organization you know they may not be<br>using a product or they might go to a<br>competitor so there are these<br>analytics programs that can actually<br>identify key people who might be at risk<br>of leaving<br>leaving a particular<br>product or a service<br>for example they might not be using a<br>product or they may be using at a lower<br>frequency or<br>they may be posting negative feedback<br>through reviews right online reviews so<br>these analytics programs can look at all<br>of that and predict somebody's going to<br>leave and then they can prescribe what<br>strategies might best suit that<br>particular individual you know what<br>incentives to offer um you know what<br>perks to offer so that they can prevent<br>that customer from leaving so i wouldn't<br>go into any of the other examples i find<br>the other examples fascinating as well<br>but um i'll spare that this time around<br>um so business analytics minor will<br>cover all these different areas of<br>analytics so the key thing i want you to<br>take away is there is huge amounts of<br>data and there are lots of<br>analytics techniques um and the most<br>complex one would be the prescriptive<br>analytics and that's becoming a hot area<br>um<br>in the modern business context<br>so quickly touching upon the structure<br>of the minor what we wanted to focus on<br>is<br>there are five papers<br>as a part of the minor<br>the ones in green are the compulsory<br>ones at the bottom<br>so in these three papers<br>the students will learn about the<br>different types of analytics techniques<br>so the techniques are taught in these<br>three papers<br>once they've covered these three papers<br>then they can actually go and specialize<br>in a particular commerce domain it could<br>be in accounting<br>or it could be in finance or it could be<br>in economics and so on so what this<br>program allows is it allows<br>the students to learn the techniques and<br>then allows them to apply in a<br>particular domain of their major so<br>accounting students can take the<br>accounting pathway finance students can<br>take the finance pathway economic<br>students can take the economics pathway<br>and so on so we've not covered all the<br>different pathways so that's work in<br>progress we are hoping in the future<br>there will be specialized papers um in<br>other areas of commerce as well<br>so the target audience for this minor is<br>become mages<br>but of course other<br>students from outside commerce can also<br>take this minor<br>so what are the highlights of this miner<br>this miner goes to the entire data<br>science workflow so once they have<br>learned about the workflow they can<br>apply this workflow for any domain so<br>that's actually the neat aspect of<br>the data science pathway so once you've<br>learned the part the workflow you can<br>pretty much apply to any discipline<br>but having said that there are certain<br>techniques that are applied in<br>specialized<br>commerce fields for example<br>in time series modeling is is often used<br>in finance and accounting right mostly<br>in finance so you will in in the courses<br>that you take<br>in<br>the financial<br>analytics side of things you'll<br>specialize in those set of models<br>so this<br>miner enables both specialization and<br>diversification what i mean by that is<br>if you're an accounting major then this<br>miner allows you to specialize in<br>accounting analytics<br>um so that's a specialization<br>what i mean by diversification is if<br>you're a marketing major you can still<br>diversify yourself in financial<br>analytics by<br>taking appropriate papers in financial<br>analytics side of things but i would<br>think<br>the most common pathway would be the<br>specialization side of things where you<br>specialize um<br>in the context of your major<br>so the main career opportunity for um<br>students who are taking this minor is<br>the data analyst pathway or the business<br>intelligence pathway where students can<br>become you know accounting analyst or<br>financial analyst or marketing analyst<br>so these are typically students who have<br>a major um in a particular field like<br>accounting and they specialize in<br>analyzing data in the accounting context<br>but there are also more specialized<br>roles like customer relationship<br>management analyst social media analyst<br>so what uh what is the suitability<br>of students you know what kind of<br>students<br>would be interested um i would think<br>anyone who is interested in data<br>like finding patterns and if they're<br>interested in finding patents and data<br>this would be a good minor for them and<br>they should also be not afraid of<br>computing so<br>they<br>they don't have to be<br>the studio type nerds in computing but<br>as long as they're not afraid this is<br>actually a good pathway for them to<br>pursue<br>and we don't expect any special<br>preparation at school at all<br>this is mainly because we give them all<br>the foundational material<br>as a part of<br>the package that we offer<br>but if they have some stats background<br>or computing background that would be a<br>recommended preparation but it's not<br>absolutely um required okay<br>so finally i would like to leave you<br>with this code<br>from jeffrey moore<br>i think this nicely summarizes what<br>analytics is all about so it says<br>without big data analytics companies are<br>blind and deaf wandering<br>out onto the web like a deer on a<br>freeway so<br>i would think this will become a<br>necessity for most commerce students and<br>i'm hoping that<br>you uh as<br>the school liaison<br>people and the careers advices would<br>advise them to actually take up this<br>minor and i would i would think this<br>will really strengthen their career<br>opportunities okay so with that i would<br>be happy to<br>take any questions<br>sorry that was a very<br>quick whirlwind tour of what i wanted to<br>cover<br>hopefully the<br>analytics 101 was not too boring i hope<br>you got something out of it i just<br>wanted to relay that<br>there is depth in altx um there is a<br>there is a continuum right so you start<br>shallow and then you go really deep<br>that's where the predictive and<br>prescriptive analytics uh comes into<br>play okay so thank you<br>thanks tony i found it really<br>interesting it's karen from schools<br>liaison here what i found most<br>fascinating was how it can apply to so<br>many different areas<br>um are you expecting people students<br>that are doing like science degrees to<br>to do the business analytics minor<br>so that's a very good question i i<br>actually do not know what is going to<br>happen but my hope is that you know it's<br>it's a subset of analytics as you may<br>know there is a data science program<br>which is a major in sciences<br>so this would be a nice supplement to<br>commerce students so it's mainly<br>targeted commerce students but the three<br>basic papers<br>that form the core of the business<br>analytics minor you know anyone can<br>benefit from it<br>as long as<br>the science majors are interested in<br>learning some part of<br>business then it will be suitable for<br>them um but if they don't have any<br>interest in<br>business subjects at all then i don't<br>think it's going to be attractive<br>because as you can as you may see in one<br>of the slides there are two papers that<br>they must take from<br>the business core in the sense that you<br>know they had to specialize in their<br>particular business domain um it could<br>be accounting it could be marketing so<br>as long as they're interested in a<br>business domain then it's going to be<br>beneficial<br>for them but i'm hoping that there'll be<br>science students who actually take up<br>thanks<br>we've got some lovely comments um in the<br>chat there tony i have to say jeepers<br>when i first saw that i was going to be<br>learning about business analytics i<br>thought fire output<br>because it's got my two favorite things<br>uh<br>computers and maths but actually you<br>made it make sense i really loved your<br>style by giving the the actual personal<br>examples and i'm a great fan of charts i<br>loved those particularly those two<br>charts that showed the process so<br>i really feel quite confident now that<br>if i meet any young people who you know<br>in my background conversation with him i<br>go oh actually maybe this would be a<br>good thing for you to look at to explore<br>that i can confidently talk about it so<br>thank you for that i just found that so<br>interesting i was like oh you know<br>particularly the you know the real life<br>examples i thought that was great so<br>thank you for your clarifications<br>i also an absent and absenteer because i<br>think that um<br>john's gone off to um his lecture but i<br>also found that so interesting and that<br>i've met those students right from the<br>start we all have i know in in schools<br>and schools liaison who as soon as you<br>started talking about the flexibility<br>the opportunity to build in<br>subject-based knowledge and many of them<br>already had their own businesses or<br>business ideas whereas john mentioned<br>their desire for social change and how<br>do i do that either alongside my real<br>life or within an existing organization<br>so i would like to thank him as well for<br>his really good explanation of what's<br>available for our students in that space<br>so we're going to move now i think to a<br>break</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
