technology degree<br>yep and i'm missy molloy and i'm a<br>senior lecturer in the film program and<br>i'm also the program director um so we<br>often work closely together as our<br>interests are quite aligned yes<br>thank you so much for joining us this<br>afternoon our format today is i will<br>speak for about 20 minutes<br>and then i'll hand over to missy and<br>missy will present for about 20 minutes<br>and then we'll have another 20 minutes<br>to have a discussion with you all and<br>hopefully you'll have some questions and<br>thoughts and you can just type them into<br>the chat function<br>on zoom and we will field the<br>discussion from there<br>great<br>so today's discussion is titled racial<br>dimensions of screen aesthetics<br>and to set us up i'd like to offer some<br>working definitions of some of the terms<br>i'm going to be using in this talk<br>scholars like angela davis and ibram x<br>kendi urge us to make a distinction<br>between the idea of not a racist and<br>anti-racist<br>not a racist has historically been<br>understood as a personal stance that has<br>been used as a form of denial<br>particularly when justifying<br>racism through policy science religion<br>etc<br>anti-racist is an active ongoing pursuit<br>which goes beyond personal beliefs<br>and focuses on systemic structural and<br>legislative policies and practices that<br>enable racism anti-racist is not a<br>i can't really define aesthetics because<br>it's an entire branch of philosophy that<br>addresses beauty the sublime meaning so<br>basically everything but for our<br>purposes it's about how we define<br>constructs of beauty which emerge in the<br>15th century europe<br>um<br>in the 15th century european context and<br>more specifically beauty lighting which<br>allows us to consider the technologies<br>materials shading<br>and rendering related to realistic<br>representations of the human face<br>critical aesthetics means we don't have<br>to first have a discussion about plato<br>kant and nietzsche we can instead<br>question and critique standards<br>of beauty that have been established in<br>the context of renaissance portraiture<br>for our purposes i will focus on<br>self-portraiture and we'll see why this<br>matters<br>when i say anti-racist critical<br>aesthetics i mean first to recognize the<br>historic patterns and practices of<br>racism<br>in regards to the realistic<br>representation of the human face<br>which we consider the creation of beauty<br>and second to interrupt these patterns<br>so why are we talking about all this<br>bold stuff shouldn't we be talking about<br>from a light and material and shading<br>perspective technical artists will<br>recognize the relationship between these<br>two images<br>one of the reasons why i find the<br>comparison of renaissance painting to<br>visual effects to be so compelling<br>is that like the discourse of vfx<br>painting at this time was a tension<br>between craftsmanship and artistry<br>there were arguments on either side and<br>what was at stake was the role of and<br>the significance of painters themselves<br>were portrait painters visionary<br>creatives or were they just there to<br>execute<br>the vision of wealthy patrons<br>i'm also interested in the word effects<br>what it means and when it came into<br>common usage<br>during the antiquities the term effects<br>was used by aristotle to describe the<br>practice or technique or art<br>which involved bodily labor<br>aristotle believed that this bodily<br>labor was used to create effects and<br>should be preserved for slaves and<br>craftspeople<br>so this sets up a discourse of<br>disciplines for a very long time which<br>is that privileged men had thoughts and<br>the art historian pamela smith writes<br>that it's only when effects were<br>combined with science in the 16th<br>century that effects or rather art came<br>to be understood as the production of<br>knowledge<br>around this time when science transforms<br>effects into art another important thing<br>happens<br>the most significant treatise of the<br>renaissance was published<br>in the middle of the 16th century a<br>painter named giorgio vasari writes a<br>book about the artists of the<br>renaissance<br>this book establishes the legend of<br>painters like michelangelo<br>and we can understand vasari as the<br>original hype man without this book the<br>reputation and rock star status of<br>renaissance painters would not have been<br>lives isn't exactly a scholarly work<br>vasari mostly wrote about his friends<br>and people he admired where he lacked<br>facts he made things up<br>nevertheless lives has become an<br>important historic document<br>the point i want to make here is that<br>the renaissance wasn't just a time of<br>great experimentation and discovery for<br>art science and technology<br>it was also a time when the role of the<br>artist as a public figure and<br>storyteller was established<br>since the antiquities the labor of art<br>had been the domain of slaves and<br>craftspeople but we now understood it to<br>be the profession of a group of elite<br>people and by we i don't just mean we<br>artists and people who are invested in<br>art but significantly also the general<br>public<br>i'm gonna focus now on a subset of these<br>elite artists specifically the artists<br>who painted their own image because it's<br>through their work that we can<br>understand and imagine the embodied<br>experience of being an artist and the<br>production of art<br>in the context of the renaissance<br>self-portrait i want to ask some<br>questions what is the role of the artist<br>and who gets to be an artist<br>many of you may be familiar with this<br>painting as recently as late 2020 the<br>new york times ran an interactive essay<br>about its significance<br>this is albrecht durr painting himself<br>in the 16th century and it is we are to<br>understand the myth on which every<br>selfie stands<br>an image so detailed it appeared as<br>divine creation<br>der was known then and now as an<br>entrepreneur of new media<br>it is some people believe the greatest<br>self-portrait ever painted<br>and it's arrogant and fetishistic in its<br>detail<br>the skin the hair the cloth the fur<br>everything is mathematically perspective<br>mathematically accurate including the<br>perspective the veins of the hand the<br>reflection that we see in these in his<br>eyes and this is the language of visual<br>effects as well we see durer here as a<br>man who is worthy of being depicted<br>and this is just one of many moments in<br>which race class and gender are encoded<br>into the subject matter of the artist's<br>story<br>we know for example that women did paint<br>their own portraits at this time but<br>that history isn't well circulated<br>these are all the self-portraits of<br>renaissance women painters that have so<br>far been uncovered for example sofinispa<br>sofinispa an angisola and artemisia<br>gentileski's biographies have had to be<br>in the category of renaissance<br>self-portraiture i have uncovered only<br>two people of color<br>and here the ancestry is uncertain those<br>scholars have made cases for the african<br>ancestry of both of these artists on the<br>left we have francesco torbito ilmoro<br>suggesting he was a moor of indian or<br>ethiopian descent and on the right we<br>have sculptor andrea briosco riccio<br>riccio being italian for hedgehog and<br>likely a reference to his curly hair the<br>historian kim hall has noted that in<br>renaissance england for example black<br>was not so much the opposite of white<br>but rather the opposite of beautiful and<br>fair<br>hall says that it's a peculiarity of the<br>english language that beauty and<br>blondness are the same word<br>this was not necessarily the case for<br>other european languages and because<br>race was not understood as a labeling<br>device at this time the appearance of<br>skin color<br>was the primary vehicle for otherness<br>it's no surprise therefore that the<br>identity of black painters during this<br>period is uncertain<br>so if we go back to that long list of<br>painters vasari catalog now the great<br>painters<br>we do see three women we see again<br>sofinispa angisola plautia nelly and<br>proper zia de rossi<br>francesco torbito the more also made the<br>cut but everyone else here is a european<br>man<br>a lot happens in the next 300 years<br>but the ideas around the great painter<br>and the value applied to their work<br>doesn't change that much<br>if we fast forward to the late 20th<br>century and look at the digital human<br>i want to ask some questions that we've<br>already asked<br>what is the role of the digital human<br>what we see in the first few waves of<br>digital human<br>or rather the first wave is a kind of<br>portraiture that emerges from the<br>tradition of der<br>technologists and actors who are<br>interested in using technology to tell<br>their stories people like marlon brando<br>on the top left andy circus mike seymour<br>doug robles<br>are all turned into digital humans and<br>if you haven't seen doug robles talk<br>doug robles is on the bottom left-hand<br>corner it's really fascinating he does a<br>tech talk uh ted talk where he wears a<br>motion capture facial motion capture<br>suit while he's on stage and he talks<br>about the technology of the digital<br>human while performing the digital human<br>and it's a really fascinating kind of<br>insight into this process about the<br>embodiment of the digital human at this<br>moment<br>when when it was made<br>vincent who's on the top left there<br>was made by a korean team<br>five men at a studio called giant step<br>but all of the skin shaders and<br>technology to create vincent was<br>actually modeled on the characters and<br>skin shading of meet mike who sits<br>directly below him so it's easy to see<br>here how the research and technology on<br>creating the likeness of white men<br>in the last few years uh we start we see<br>what is the second what i call the<br>second wave of digital humans um and the<br>kind of person who can be a digital<br>human has started to shift we see more<br>diverse faces<br>but these digital humans do not speak<br>for themselves these digital humans<br>perform but their technology and purpose<br>is explained to us by the white men who<br>made them<br>uh we see in the way for example micah<br>who's at the top left and she's like<br>like a<br>an influencer<br>uh was made by uh isaac brutzil of brood<br>studio um there's siren who's on the<br>bottom left on the bottom right senua<br>and even will smith's digital human<br>uh digital double are showcased at tech<br>conferences the but the visual effects<br>supervisors we are to understand<br>who made them talk about them as a kind<br>of blank canvas telling us what digital<br>humans can do<br>and what their purpose is<br>the likeness of siren for example is<br>based on a real chinese actor a woman<br>named binji zhang but binji herself<br>never speaks or performs siren she is<br>only presented to us through the<br>interpretation of the men who make her<br>technology<br>and now we have epic's metahuman<br>platform<br>as our sort of<br>not final but third and current wave of<br>digital humans and there's an<br>opportunity here<br>both scholars ted kim and jim malazita<br>have talked in detail<br>about how subsurface<br>modeling specularity and metalness which<br>are technologies that are incorporated<br>into skin shading intervene with the<br>accurate modeling of black skin on the<br>001 metahuman model as she is known on<br>the left hand side the black woman<br>more specifically how motion um<br>and so i worry about our inability to<br>talk about the performance of race<br>that's happening so these two characters<br>um the original two meta-humans that<br>were published<br>um were released as part of epic's um<br>early access on the metahuman platform<br>and they became the characters that the<br>first uh that you know tech artists<br>around the world started experimenting<br>with to understand how easy to use and<br>accessible this technology was<br>so<br>during that process and and since i<br>worry about our inability to talk about<br>the performance of race that is<br>happening here with these characters<br>more specifically how motion capture<br>technology facilitates and enables the<br>performance of race and digital<br>blackface<br>we're at the other end of the spectrum<br>now where these digital humans are<br>presented not as embodied<br>actors uh and people who take ownership<br>of their technology and can talk about<br>their presence<br>but as blank as empty vessels<br>but there is another way to think about<br>portraits<br>and this is a portrait that many of you<br>may be familiar with night in the fare<br>from 1912. it's a portrait of inate papa<br>tahi<br>and ina sat for cf goldie the painter<br>many times and was a descendant of maori<br>chiefs who signed the treaty of waitangi<br>portraits can be complicated here in new<br>zealand we have a series of paintings by<br>cf goldie who was known as a colonial<br>painter<br>and these arise out of the same<br>tradition of european painting as we saw<br>with the durer self-portrait so cf<br>goldie would have trained in the salons<br>of europe and understood these<br>techniques<br>but we can understand them differently<br>they function in a context of<br>co-production<br>goldie had a number of important maori<br>historical figures who sat for his<br>portraits and these images were designed<br>and crafted through mutual agreement<br>and if you if you look at the um the<br>research and writings of roger blackley<br>the new zealand art historian he's<br>written extensively about this process<br>in new zealand we understand these<br>portraits not as an art object but as<br>tonga which means treasured possession<br>but also artifacts and war booty<br>and the place of these portraits is<br>uneasy right it's it's it's all of these<br>things but it approaches a more<br>equitable way of producing and<br>spectating looking at<br>the nuance brought about by<br>co-production between author and subject<br>combined with the emotional<br>combined with the embodied perspective<br>respective of the artist practicing<br>self-portraiture is i believe a way to<br>bring us closer to what we can all agree<br>we want more of which is better stories<br>in my lighting and rendering class here<br>at victoria university<br>at the school of design we've been<br>experimenting with these ideas<br>and in the first year that i ran this<br>course in order to teach lighting<br>we used generic digital humans that we<br>purchased on the marketplace<br>and the results were fine they were<br>acceptable students learned how to light<br>they understood the technology and the<br>craft<br>um but what i found is that the the<br>outcomes<br>didn't sing they weren't special they<br>weren't interesting they didn't tell<br>stories<br>they were just kind of like exercises in<br>understanding technology and so what we<br>started doing is having the students go<br>through this process and create and<br>craft and build their own digital humans<br>of themselves and what i found is in<br>doing that there is a level of care and<br>storytelling that emerges when artists<br>learn the principles of lighting through<br>self-portraiture<br>the designer dr dory tunstall has a name<br>for this she calls it respectful design<br>respectful design is about designing<br>ourselves into our environment so that<br>we can design and problem solve from the<br>inside out rather than approaching a<br>design problem from the outside<br>and imagining solutions for a<br>speculative user group or a speculative<br>perspective<br>and so here again is more examples of<br>the work that's produced by my students<br>thank you so much i am now going to turn<br>over to missy molloy who's going to<br>carry on this discussion<br>ready<br>so i'm shifting gears radically i hope<br>that's not too awkward<br>um<br>a chapter that i wrote a couple years<br>ago actually about top of the lake china<br>girl which is the second season of jane<br>campion's um<br>successful television program the only<br>one she's made so far<br>um<br>i this chapter came out last month<br>i'm presenting research<br>from the chapter but i'm also kind of<br>taking a point that i raised in the<br>conclusion of the chapter or that came<br>up<br>as a sub claim throughout the chapter<br>and i'm taking that and kind of delving<br>more deeply into it<br>because as you can tell from the title<br>of the chapter which was fetal imagery<br>and alternative maternities in jane<br>campion's top of the lake i was focusing<br>on images not only of<br>fetuses in the series but also of<br>infants and babies who feature kind of<br>prominently in the series and my thesis<br>statement for the chapter is<br>on the slide here the chapter reads<br>china girl as the culmination of jane<br>campion's career-long attention to the<br>convolutions of the mother-daughter bond<br>and top of the lake as a whole as<br>confirmation of campion's status as the<br>contemporary screen author most<br>committed to the peculiar complexities<br>of motherhood which top of the lake<br>closely scrutinizes through portraits of<br>alternative maternities including early<br>teen pregnancy adoption and surrogacy<br>and the cover of the book is there on<br>so i wanted to present some of the<br>material from the chapter that has to do<br>with my reading of the feminist<br>aesthetics and in my view the feminist<br>aesthetics are rooted in the series<br>treatment of maternity as a fairly<br>complex subjective<br>state of mind and also a diverse<br>portraits of maternity that the series<br>provides<br>but i also wanted to ask this question<br>which i kind of circled back to in the<br>conclusion of the chapter do women of<br>color have a place in jane campion<br>celebrated screen feminism and i'm using<br>top of the lake to answer that question<br>or at least provide some preliminary<br>hypotheses<br>so i will cover some of the points in<br>the chapter but i'll also<br>cover aesthetic and narrative functions<br>of the main one of the<br>major<br>characters in top of the lake china girl<br>is the first victim in the series so<br>she's called china girl by the<br>um by the police and the coroner when<br>they're when they first discover the<br>body because they can't id her and it<br>turns out that she's<br>um<br>she's a sex worker and surrogate and<br>she's originally from thailand and it<br>takes them until the fifth episode<br>of the series before we get like her<br>actual name so<br>initially what she's referred to as<br>china girl and later she's referred to<br>as cinnamon and then at the very end we<br>get her given name which is padma so<br>i'll talk a little bit about<br>how she functions in the series and i'll<br>also talk about how the other asian sex<br>workers who are surrogates as well how<br>they function in the series and that's<br>in order to come to some preliminary<br>conclusions about women of color in the<br>feminist aesthetics of china girl i just<br>wanted to give a little bit of<br>background about the series protagonist<br>and the reason is<br>because this presentation makes a lot<br>more sense to people who have seen at<br>least one of the seasons but especially<br>the second season of top of the lake but<br>the main character is<br>um<br>played by elizabeth moss so a lot of<br>people are familiar with her so just put<br>her face up on the screen but she's the<br>series protagonist<br>and she's a police detective and in the<br>first season she travels<br>home to the south island of new zealand<br>to an area around glenorchy and<br>queenstown<br>because her mother is terminally ill<br>with cancer and she ends up involved in<br>a case that's uh about uh that deals<br>with rape and rape related pregnancy and<br>in the second season she's only recently<br>returned to sydney and here she's<br>working on a case<br>um that deals with the reproductive<br>black market<br>and like a lot of crime drama in um kind<br>of peak prestige television era her<br>cases each season align um uncannily<br>with her personal life and traumas so<br>the crime that she deals with is usually<br>highly relevant to a trauma or a<br>psychological struggle struggle that<br>she's facing and in addition to that<br>kind of<br>thematic alignment<br>between the crime and<br>her personal life we also usually<br>discover<br>that she's even more personally<br>connected like literal connection so in<br>the first series um the first kind of<br>villain character he turns out to be<br>her father that she didn't know that and<br>in the second season she becomes<br>acquainted with um the daughter she gave<br>birth to in her teens who she put up for<br>adoption she becomes acquainted with her<br>and her daughter is<br>intricately woven into this surrogacy<br>reproductive black market scheme<br>so you can see that the the personal and<br>the professional are really tightly<br>linked in the series<br>so in the<br>chapter i read the feminist aesthetic as<br>hinging on maternal ambivalence so i see<br>a lot of productive potential in the<br>series and china girl specifically in<br>the way it kind of represents maternal<br>suffering as cyclical and reproductive<br>and it shows its intensity is amplified<br>by women's subordinate status and<br>patriarchal societies<br>in an article that was published around<br>the time of china girl's release jane<br>campion made this statement uh when she<br>was discussing china girl<br>she said this whole area of female<br>experience and she's referring to<br>maternal desire ambivalence trauma and<br>loss is so unknown but it's like the<br>equivalent of going to war except no one<br>makes movies about it and so this is the<br>area that i was especially interested in<br>how the series delved into<br>these experiences of maternity um so in<br>second season it's dealing a lot with<br>women who are having severe difficulties<br>getting pregnant and that they go<br>through<br>ivf nine times and they spend a lot of<br>money they put their house they mortgage<br>their houses so it's about this<br>desperation to be pregnant that drives<br>the reproductive um industry and that<br>therefore gives rise to this black<br>market and i found that the<br>the serious treatment of<br>the intensity of the desire to be a<br>mother and also the tense experiences<br>that mothers have i felt that this was<br>um<br>unique and feminist<br>so i put a little line from the chapter<br>china girl's casting of maternity in a<br>criminal light aligns with campion's<br>view of women's experiences as mothers<br>lovers and daughters as dangerously<br>intense and spectacularly transgressive<br>so to me the aesthetics of mothers and<br>of babies and fetuses registers this<br>kind of transgression and dangerous<br>intensity and earlier in champion's<br>career i think that the focus was more<br>on um<br>women characters<br>struggling in patriarchal<br>societies for personal and artistic and<br>creative kind of autonomy and<br>recognition so this shifts to a focus on<br>so some of the images that i kind of<br>highlight have to do with these<br>really striking sequences in which<br>the subjective experiences of the<br>mothers including robin are rendered in<br>with surreal imagery that gets at the<br>strangeness of their experiences of<br>motherhood so china girl throughout so<br>these in these sequences are sprinkled<br>throughout the episodes but it's<br>consistently reiterating maternal desire<br>as dangerously intense to the extent<br>that mothers are singularly vulnerable<br>this image might be a little more<br>difficult for you to see because it's<br>oh wait let me explain this one quickly<br>so in this one robin is this is her in<br>the middle of the night suffering from a<br>um a kind of episode where she's having<br>difficulty determining reality from her<br>own kind of imagination and she's<br>imagining kind of outlines of herself at<br>earlier ages with different aged<br>infant figures<br>and she's kind of like<br>nurturing them at different stages of<br>development<br>and this is a kind of dream sequence and<br>it ends in her<br>screaming in terror and kind of<br>so robin's not the only character who<br>has these kind of experiences in the<br>series one of the mothers who<br>is um part of the surrogacy scheme so<br>she's paid<br>an a surrogate which is illegal there's<br>no commercial surrogacy allowed in<br>australia she's paid a surrogate to kind<br>of carry her child<br>she loses touch with the surrogate and<br>then she becomes<br>extremely anxious to the extent that<br>she's uh put into a mental institution<br>so it<br>it kind of animates in a surreal<br>sequence her<br>experience<br>and in this image she's wandering around<br>looking for her baby and in terror and<br>saying that she she can't find it<br>and the infant is kind of this very<br>strange<br>creature<br>that's definitely not designed to look<br>cuddly or kind of<br>cute in any sort of familiar<br>conventional<br>infant imagery sense so it's a gaunt and<br>a horrifying infant to kind of um<br>complement her experience in that moment<br>so my conclusion was that these striking<br>images that they're compelling they're<br>disturbing they're otherworldly they<br>emphatically express the ambivalence<br>many mothers experience<br>so a lot of times their faces will<br>the actresses faces will register<br>very<br>conflicting emotions so usually it's<br>something like rapture combined with<br>dread and here is where i see um<br>feminist potential in the rendition of<br>maternity that's not quite comfortable<br>or or idealized in any sense<br>and in this particular episode um<br>she's kind of getting dressed for work<br>and she's holding two tiny perfectly<br>so<br>in the course of kind of<br>delving into the representation of<br>mothers<br>in this this second series which is<br>focused on uh the reproductive black<br>market i came to the conclusions that i<br>pasted in on the right which was there<br>was a strange disconnect between the<br>attention paid<br>to the<br>wealthy um white mothers who were<br>implicated in the surrogacy scheme and<br>the women<br>who provided the<br>their bodies to make the surrogacies uh<br>work to make it run<br>and i thought that this was particular<br>or initially striking in the and the<br>lack of emphasis on china girl herself<br>the fact that we don't get very much uh<br>information about her and that her<br>characterization is quite thin<br>and then i as i continued on in that<br>track i decided to analyze the overall<br>kind of depiction of the other sex<br>workers who live in the same brothel<br>where cinnamon had lived before her<br>death and then who are also serving as<br>surrogates so to me it was um<br>striking how there was that<br>um<br>inequality between the kind of<br>attention to the characterizations so to<br>me this signaled some kind of weakness<br>because<br>the series is trying to<br>represent the fact that these crimes are<br>linked that the desperate desire for<br>maternity on the part of<br>clients of the surrogacy scheme that it<br>links them really intimately<br>with the<br>the women providing the service the<br>surrogates and yet<br>most of the<br>depth of the series attention is on the<br>wealthier white women so i wanted to<br>give you a better sense of how the other<br>characters do feature<br>you've seen a little bit of how robin<br>and felicity are depicted with their<br>subjective kind of experiences i put an<br>image of robin on the left and that's<br>another illustration of kind of a close<br>attention to her face<br>in an experience of maternal<br>intensity she's enraptured by the sight<br>of her daughter who she gave up for<br>adoption who she hasn't seen in 16 or 17<br>years<br>she's also kind of has a bit of pain in<br>her face so that complexity is coming<br>through in the expressions there<br>so at the time of the release jane<br>campion was asked multiple times to<br>comment on the asian themes<br>this is from a variety article and it<br>says regardless of whether you enjoy top<br>of the lake china girl the provocative<br>title in the series racial makeup<br>certainly raises eyebrows while all the<br>leads of the show are white the china<br>girl herself the victim of the crime at<br>the center of the story is a thai<br>immigrant that was also true the first<br>season which focused on tui a 12 year<br>old asian pre-teen who walks into a lake<br>after discovering she's pregnant and<br>i'll just note that um<br>tui is actually a<br>in the first season too he's a new<br>zealander she has a thai immigrant<br>mother and a scottish immigrant father<br>so she's an asian new zealander<br>so a lot of the reviews and some of the<br>scholarly writing on the series has<br>drawn attention to this parallel<br>and i think it's interesting that if you<br>compare the two if you've seen the first<br>season atop the lake tui is actually a<br>major character and she's a top uh she's<br>listed as one of the key cast members<br>she's in the title sequence<br>um and she's her character arc is kind<br>of dynamic she features pretty regularly<br>in the episodes in comparison china<br>girls is strikingly<br>thin and we don't ever get that kind of<br>sense that she's a major character she<br>seems more like an incidental despite<br>the fact that she's in the title<br>and i was struck by the fact that it<br>when jane campbell was speaking about<br>this she says she thinks it is<br>purposeful<br>and it the titles implies that she's<br>going to explain the asian themes and<br>yet it's kind of inconclusive the the<br>articles um<br>coverage of that kind of explanation and<br>you can see it in the hesitation over<br>language<br>to me it's interesting how both<br>women are used as the inciting incidents<br>for the plot so they're made they play a<br>major role in the in moving the plot<br>forward and they also uh are key to this<br>early aesthetic establishment of<br>uh quite beautiful and compelling water<br>imagery uh with their kind of<br>superficial aspects of their um<br>physicality so in the first season we<br>have a lot of images of tui when she's<br>going into the lake<br>and in the second season we get the<br>images of china girl cinnamon padma who<br>is already dead in these sequences and<br>she's in a screened suitcase and her<br>hair her black hair is coming out of the<br>suitcase<br>so<br>this image that i have up here<br>it doesn't come to light until around<br>episode four or five<br>and this is a photograph that robin and<br>her partner miranda discover<br>at the home of one of cinema cinnamon's<br>clients<br>a client who had frequently hired her<br>for um<br>what is it called oh for girlfriend<br>experiences so he was a client who was<br>like more invested in her personally<br>than most of her clients and he even<br>considered them<br>them like in love<br>so<br>we see this image of her<br>late in the series<br>and then after this point we begin to<br>see her in imagined episodes from the<br>perspective of brett that client<br>and he's imagining having sexual<br>encounters with her so in those<br>sequences where sh that's the main place<br>that she's actually features in the<br>series she's blatantly objectified she's<br>blatantly objectified to register the<br>point of view of brett<br>we don't get any kind of imaginary<br>sequences from her perspective which is<br>interesting because that contrasts um<br>like the imaginary sequences i showed<br>you from robin<br>and<br>felicity and other characters have those<br>throughout but none of the asian sex<br>workers have those<br>so when i started to consider the way<br>the other sex worker surrogates are<br>featured<br>i noted that there was a tendency to<br>have<br>many of<br>asian sex worker characters that aren't<br>really um<br>too well differentiated in the same shot<br>and they kind of move as a pack<br>they kind of lounge around parentally<br>perennially scantily clad<br>the series is emphasizing that the<br>different social economic classes are<br>parasitic that they feed on each other<br>but like i said before<br>that<br>the effective and kind of psychological<br>emphasis is on um the clients the older<br>white women who are paying for that<br>service rather than on the younger<br>asian sex workers who are supplying<br>that so i give you another example of<br>that kind of tendency to depict them as<br>a pack so i'm saying that they are sort<br>of figuring as a single collective<br>there's not much individuation there's a<br>slight bit which i might have the chance<br>to touch on<br>um this strongly contrasts the<br>multi-dimensional<br>multi-dimensional characterizations of<br>the affluent white women<br>um<br>and that includes robin's partner in the<br>case who's miranda and that's she's<br>played by game of thrones actress<br>gwendolyn christie so all the top casts<br>in this series um are the white affluent<br>characters<br>a chapter that came out pretty quickly<br>after the series um premiered is called<br>white vulnerability in the politics of<br>reproduction in top of the lake china<br>girl<br>they kind of presented this critique<br>which i um<br>i kind of agree with they they said this<br>about the series it's an intense<br>emotional drama about white women's<br>experiences of sexual violence<br>reproduction of motherhood the affective<br>economy of the series attaches great<br>value to white femininity as precious<br>emotionally fragile and at risk of abuse<br>against the flat backdrop of passive and<br>emotionally indifferent<br>asian sex workers<br>and that's a pretty strong indictment of<br>the series i think there is it's maybe a<br>little more complicated than that though<br>i do on the whole agree with what<br>they're saying there<br>so i'm going to give you a little before<br>i wrap up and draw a couple of<br>conclusions i wanted to give you a<br>little bit of a direct taste of the way<br>this fung this this works in the editing<br>and the kind of imagery<br>of the series so in the second episode<br>um robin and miranda are<br>first they visit with a sex worker<br>collective and they speak with this<br>woman linda who represents uh the sex<br>worker collective because they're trying<br>to get help iding china girl at that<br>point they have difficulty doing that<br>um while linda explains typical um<br>student visa false passport scenarios<br>she provocatively states we all look the<br>same to you<br>after she says that<br>miranda leans forward and says do we all<br>look the same to you<br>in reply linda laughs dismissively<br>that<br>ends that scene and then we cut to lend<br>a kind of a montage sequence in which<br>linda leads robin and miranda around<br>kind of<br>um<br>on a tour of different brothels where<br>they ask questions to see whether they<br>can figure out which brothel cinnamon<br>came from and who she exactly was<br>so it does make sense narratively for us<br>to be in the perspective<br>of robin as the protagonist and as the<br>detective on the case kind of pursuing<br>this line of inquiry and yet these<br>visits to the brothels um the way<br>they're<br>rendered with image and sound it<br>intensifies the her status as like an<br>outsider coming into an exotic and<br>foreign terrain and i i isolated in<br>particular this shot<br>wherein we are kind of placed in the<br>peeping<br>tom perspective of robin<br>who's kind of like an uninvited and a<br>stranger kind of coming into this space<br>and then when she looks<br>when she looks at them we get the look<br>back<br>and it's um<br>again like a collective looking back at<br>her because at least three of them meet<br>her gays three of the women on the bed<br>she doesn't speak with them it just cuts<br>so to me this<br>it intensifies this kind of enigmatic<br>quality of the<br>of the asian sex workers stories and it<br>suggests that they're kind of that their<br>subjectivities unlike the white women<br>characters in the series are<br>impenetrable because when they meet<br>the white women characters like felicity<br>that are the other end of the<br>reproductive black market<br>we get a lot of information about their<br>um subjective experience and we get<br>those imaginary encounters from their<br>point of views and we don't get those um<br>i did want to highlight that there is a<br>character who gets some um<br>has a speaking role and gets a bit more<br>differentiation as the series progresses<br>and her name is caramel and she's in the<br>middle there played by merlin tong but<br>she<br>her characterization is mainly uh<br>pretty one-dimensional like for instance<br>when they go there's a scene where they<br>all go swimming together because the<br>mary who's robin's daughter<br>is concerned that they have that the sex<br>workers don't get any opportunity to go<br>out of the brothel enough so she she and<br>robin take them um<br>with her alongside her father and in<br>that scene caramel is like flirting with<br>the father and that but it's kind of<br>like a it has a mercenary quality to it<br>as a sort of a stereotype<br>so<br>some of these conclusions that i drew<br>when i started to analyze the way the<br>that cinnamon and also the sex workers<br>function<br>seem to resonate in an interesting way<br>with the title of the series in<br>combination with that promotional image<br>you see there on the right so in that<br>variety article that talks about the<br>asian themes in china girl<br>they said that the dual meaning implies<br>fetishized foreignness as well as<br>fragility and they talk about this<br>poster which shows robin naked from the<br>waist up with cracks running through her<br>torso as if she is made of porcelain and<br>to me it's really interesting to see<br>the combination between the dual meaning<br>of the title which highlights the kind<br>of um<br>incapacity of the white australian<br>characters to kind of<br>even identify<br>accurately padma<br>um<br>it<br>tailors that or like tattoos that onto<br>the white protagonist character to kind<br>of bring to the surface that idea of<br>women as uniquely fragile in patriarchal<br>societies which is one of the points<br>that i think jane campion tends to make<br>consistently with her work<br>so that kind of attention to women's<br>vulnerability their china-like<br>aspect of them it's transposed onto<br>robin<br>even though the other meaning of it is<br>alluding to<br>the main victim of the case so to me<br>this kind of uh underscores that<br>lack of equity in the attention to the<br>different types of maternal suffering<br>that the series actually addresses<br>through the criminal emphasis on illegal<br>surrogacy<br>um and i think this is a strong contrast<br>with the top of the lake season one<br>which i think a lot more people have<br>actually seen in which there's a whole<br>community of women of different ages and<br>in different races to some extent<br>and they're kind of<br>um<br>reject<br>subverting patriarchal ideas of what how<br>women should or can function and this<br>series doesn't really have that kind of<br>alternative and productive uh potential<br>in the same way instead it kind of<br>magnifies<br>the experiences of the white women<br>characters to the detriment of the women<br>who kind of<br>carry that burden for them thank you so<br>much for joining us it would be great to<br>continue this discussion but maybe<br>we will see some of you all around town<br>it's wellington after all we can talk</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
