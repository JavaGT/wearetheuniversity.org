But the launch nearly didn’t happen – funding was cut at the 11th hour before the school opened, and it took a determined founding Professor of Law to ensure the fight to open New Zealand’s fifth law school was seen through to the end. In 2021 we celebrated 30 years of biculturalism, professionalism and teaching law in context.  <br><br>Hear from Emeritus Professor, the Honourable Margaret Wilson DCNZM, as she looks back to the founding of Te Piringa and the determination needed to get the doors open. Emeritus Professor Wilson was the first Professor of Law and the Founding Dean of Law at the University of Waikato, and she will discuss the vision and devotion of many people that established the Law school in 1990, ahead of the first intake of students in 1991.  <br><br>Join us for a walk through those testing times with Emeritus Professor Wilson who is highly regarded for her political life, her directorships and her guidance on vital issues in New Zealand. Why do the lessons from 30 years ago still have relevance? Why do long-term objectives still matter? And what do we need to be teaching students today to ensure we produce the next generation of great law graduates?</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

defeating a faculty of law<br>and just to<br>just to start i wanted to reiterate<br>accorded or from te riki nui dem<br>at the opening of the facility that was<br>led by kaimatua john honui and tui adams<br>was that when they did the karakia and<br>let the spirituality and let the law<br>become one<br>and let them be bound together in the<br>and it's absolutely fantastic to be here<br>and although<br>we couldn't celebrate the 30th year on<br>the 30th year because you know the<br>plummy covert keep getting in the road<br>but it's absolutely fantastic that<br>after 30 years we are able to come back<br>together<br>and to share stories from the beginning<br>through the middle and now with the<br>leadership of not only depicting a<br>faculty of law but with the division<br>in its entirety and with the university<br>of waikato and we<br>celebrate now and it's<br>absolutely fantastic to see the<br>working together it's absolutely<br>fantastic to have the leadership of tifa<br>kahiapo<br>amongst us<br>let us come together in celebration of<br>the 30 years of te bidinga faculty of<br>right<br>it's my job done funny so<br>i'm going to pass now to the first of<br>our speakers into<br>takurangatira uh patrick is going to<br>come up and give us some uh some quarter<br>or before inviting the next sort of set<br>with<br>thank you for what a wonderful warm<br>welcome i hope i can i can match that in<br>some way um i'm uh patrick lehmann i'm<br>the pro vice chancellor for the division<br>of arts uh law psychology and social<br>sciences<br>uh great privilege to to come and speak<br>to you today very briefly<br>to give an introduction to this<br>marvelous celebration of 30 years<br>of a distinctive and internationally<br>ranked<br>faculty of law<br>it's also obviously a huge honor and a<br>pleasure to welcome professor margaret<br>wilson<br>uh<br>known obviously as a distinguished<br>lawyer academic politician and perhaps<br>perhaps approaching the status of new<br>zealand national treasure uh i'm not<br>quite sure on the rules here but uh i i<br>reckon she she is<br>but of course many of us know her as<br>well as a colleague and a great friend<br>of this university as well as someone<br>whose name will always be connected with<br>tapering<br>we're celebrating<br>30 years a little late but um you know<br>we can all lie about our age<br>occasionally<br>of uh what i think is a unique<br>faculty<br>a faculty that has always had a<br>reputation<br>and a tradition<br>of distinctiveness at groundbreaking<br>research and excellence in education<br>an emphasis on<br>progressive and a progressive approach<br>to law<br>founded on<br>the three principles by culturalism<br>legal professionalism<br>and the study of law in context<br>and those 30<br>maybe 31 years have given us<br>what will be<br>when they graduate<br>30 cohorts<br>of young people and old people as well<br>who will be<br>the future generation of lawyers<br>both here in hamilton and across the<br>country and around the world that is an<br>impressive legacy for any institution<br>and<br>given the priority that the faculty has<br>placed on such important<br>education such important characteristics<br>a huge benefit to all of society<br>now those<br>founding themes<br>run through<br>all that the faculty<br>does<br>both in its internationally ranked<br>research did i get that in there again<br>and in its education<br>um but of course<br>the faculty has grown taper ringer is<br>now<br>a significant size<br>with an international<br>faculty of of researchers and of<br>students<br>and<br>focused not just on<br>those<br>founding principles<br>but on the future<br>and the future challenges that that um<br>all of the world<br>and new zealand will face<br>environmental and future law<br>international law<br>the internet<br>marian indigenous governance<br>and<br>crisis in energy<br>and food<br>in fact the the reaches of law at<br>waikato and of the faculty uh now extend<br>beyond the beautiful building at the top<br>of the hill<br>and the future<br>is engaging in those interdisciplinary<br>connections in informing the research of<br>others and at the same time being<br>informed by the research of others it's<br>a future that is incredibly positive and<br>i know that the<br>faculty the division and the university<br>i uh feel i'm repeating what's being<br>said before but i do want to acknowledge<br>uh the mayor<br>members of the law fraternity and<br>perhaps sorority as well<br>alumni and distinguished alumni and<br>finally<br>all of you<br>for joining us today<br>it's now a great pleasure to welcome<br>professor alpena roy<br>the dean of taper ringer<br>to continue before we welcome margaret<br>thank you very much for that very warm<br>mihi<br>rahui papa and professor patrick lehmann<br>for the welcome tonight for those of you<br>who don't know me my name is professor<br>alpena roy dean of taparinga faculty of<br>law and i'd like to extend a very very<br>very warm welcome to everyone here in<br>the room tonight and those watching<br>online<br>thank you all very much for uh for<br>attending our belated thanks to covert<br>30th anniversary celebratory lecture by<br>our founding dean emeritus professor<br>margaret wilson as she reflects on<br>tapringa's 30-year journey<br>taparinga faculty of law is very proud<br>to be celebrating our 30th anniversary<br>as rahuipapa mentioned we actually<br>turned 31 this year<br>well into our middle age<br>teperinga was founded in 1991 and is now<br>one of arturo new zealand's leading law<br>schools the faculty is patrick<br>lehmann professor patrick lehmann<br>mentioned the faculty was established<br>upon three core principles<br>professionalism biculturalism and the<br>study of law in context<br>and these founding principles continue<br>to be deeply embedded in our teaching in<br>our research and in essence what we're<br>about as a faculty<br>since our very beginnings we've always<br>looked to push the boundaries of<br>biculturalism professionalism and the<br>illegal<br>legal contextualism<br>and to draw upon a fairly recent example<br>in in march this year the new zealand<br>council of legal education our<br>regulating body<br>passed a resolution that tau maori<br>concepts particularly tikanga maori<br>would need to be taught in core llb<br>subjects and while this was seen to be a<br>fairly bold move in some parts of the<br>country this is something we've been<br>doing in teperenga for 30 or so odd<br>years<br>similarly you would have seen flies in<br>the room tonight<br>about<br>about teparina's app for the<br>new zealand law style guide this is the<br>first such legal referencing app in the<br>country and again demonstrates our<br>innovation<br>and our drive to set new standards and<br>to think differently<br>now to turn to our speaker for this<br>evening our founding dean emeritus<br>professor margaret wilson it's a<br>tremendous honor for me to introduce<br>margaret although she really doesn't<br>need an introduction<br>as is well known around the motu<br>margaret has

commissioner<br>margaret taught at auckland law school<br>until 1990<br>and then she joined us to serve as our<br>she's had a number of high-profile roles<br>including president of the labour party<br>and chief advisor and head of the prime<br>minister's office from 1999 until 2005<br>margaret was a minister of the crown<br>with a number of ministerial<br>appointments including attorney

attorney<br>general and the first woman speaker of<br>the house of representatives<br>margaret i'm standing here tonight along<br>with all of tephringa's former law deans<br>because of you<br>thank you for your vision for your<br>inspiration and for your sheer<br>determination for establishing a truly<br>unique law school here in arturoa<br>dear guests if you could please or join<br>me in welcoming our national treasure<br>emeritus professor margaret wilson our<br>oh dear<br>after that introduction what do you say<br>except welcome tenecotto tenecotto<br>denicoto cartour it's very generous of<br>you all and to ask me to talk this<br>evening<br>but i do want to sincerely welcome and<br>thank all of you who've come out this<br>evening<br>i know covert is still with us<br>but we will in fact get through it<br>and this event shows how we are starting<br>to do that<br>but i also thank you for the invitation<br>to participate in the 30th anniversary<br>of taparina<br>i think we can all agree it has been a<br>difficult two years with covet testing<br>the resilience<br>of the best of us<br>and i was thinking that to some extent<br>when i<br>was talking with people before this<br>lovely event<br>and thinking with our eminent chancellor<br>and how he and i were at law school<br>together<br>so many years ago i did reveal to him<br>that i will be 75 on friday<br>he assured me that was not actually too<br>old<br>and that his wonderful wife will will be<br>reaching that age as well<br>but talking with arnold if i may call<br>you that arnold as a friend and as a<br>supporter for too many years<br>it<br>it brought back to me how important the<br>law is<br>and the law as a profession is and how<br>over many years we support each other<br>and i suppose that to some extent is<br>some of the things i want to say this<br>evening about the importance of a law<br>school that nurtures that sort of<br>culture<br>so 30 years is a significant achievement<br>and it's worthy of recognition<br>given the traumatic events that<br>surrounded the establishment of the law<br>school<br>and i shared this evening a little of<br>those events<br>with<br>the wonderful pacifica students who came<br>to honour me with this wonderful tribute<br>and the wonderful tapa that i have put<br>on the stage here<br>and i shared with them that at that time<br>takarina or waikato law school as it was<br>known then in fact had a higher number<br>of pacifica students than auckland<br>in fact as an institution we welcomed<br>the pacific<br>and they contributed so much to those<br>early years in the culture that i think<br>has distinguished<br>purina over those 30 years and today<br>so i thank you<br>suryana<br>and the wonderful future lawyers from<br>the pacific who will make a fundamental<br>difference i know<br>in their own within their own culture<br>but within ours as well<br>so taper ringer was established in<br>troubled towns and i'm sorry to<br>disappoint you but<br>i did go through the last of my boxes as<br>numerous as they were on waikato law<br>school as it was at the time and<br>realized much of it could never be<br>that like the establishment of any<br>institution there are some things on<br>tour stay on tour<br>and certainly as i threw out emails from<br>disgruntled colleagues<br>the institution that was the waikato<br>administration and others from the<br>community i realized that 30 years on we<br>just didn't need to know<br>someone however i hope at some stage<br>when they<br>write another history either of the<br>institution or of taper ringer that in<br>fact they will be able to incorporate at<br>least in a footnote probably sanitized<br>some of the observations not only of my<br>performance but generally of how we were<br>ruining new zealand society<br>but so i thought about that and thought<br>no<br>i don't need to go over that i have<br>already recorded much of what happened<br>then in other forms happy to do so again<br>but in this speech tonight i didn't want<br>to go over it so i did what i feel most<br>relaxed and which was a little distance<br>a little analysis<br>and<br>certainly to be fair tapering was<br>established in troubled times that<br>marked the fundamental shift in tertiary<br>education institutions not only for us<br>but others as well<br>and also i think in the purpose of<br>tertiary education<br>under the policy makers at the time had<br>a neoliberal model<br>and it was not surprising that what<br>happened to the university was part of<br>that model<br>which was seen as education as<br>particularly tertiary education<br>has been primarily for the benefit of<br>the individual who now paid student fees<br>and the<br>the notion of the community and society<br>in general i think was probably<br>secondary<br>the fact that universities bless them<br>had in the past fulfilled both<br>objectives<br>seem to have been lost on those policy<br>makers who were driven perhaps by the<br>assumption that we could be more<br>efficient if we followed the market<br>approach<br>it's significant then that taper ringer<br>was established with a specific<br>principle focused<br>that has grounded and sustained it<br>during some difficult times<br>and i think in particular the birth if<br>you like is never forgotten and the<br>circumstances of the birth and this<br>focus in fact is what has been enduring<br>it was founded as the dean has said<br>on the three po<br>or pillars<br>of teaching law and context<br>developing a bicultural approach to<br>legal education and preparing students<br>for the professional practice of law<br>there were i must say very high<br>expectations at the time that the law<br>school<br>would in fact produce a different type<br>of legal education and as the dean says<br>it's taken them 30 years to catch up to<br>us<br>but we in fact have to be patient and it<br>is true<br>that some people seem to discover<br>the treaty and the teaching of law in<br>the context of the treaty as something<br>new thirty years ago we pioneered that<br>the founding document of tamata halriki<br>expressed those<br>expectations in this way and i think<br>it's worth repeating them<br>tomorrow wreaking conveys in a literal<br>sense the harassment hybris that meets<br>where earth meets the sky<br>in a practical sense a meeting place of<br>people their ideas and ideals<br>in a spiritual and metaphysical sense<br>aspiring towards justice and social<br>equity<br>it alludes to a philosophy that reflects<br>concerns that humans have for each other<br>it aspires to an environment of<br>participation of challenge debate and<br>justice in the world as it was as it is<br>and as we want it to be<br>the concept of tamata hauriki finds<br>concrete expression in our proposal to<br>create a law school<br>at the university of waikato<br>kamatohagi the first comma tour of the<br>school<br>also expressed<br>this view at the opening<br>firstly<br>to provide maori students with an<br>opportunity to graduate in law secondly<br>to ensure that curriculum reflects<br>how the law can take account<br>of the rights of maori to their land and<br>culture<br>thirdly to undertake research to ensure<br>legal recognition of maori law lore<br>and law<br>culture and rights<br>remains true today<br>at the same opening event the then<br>governor general the late dame catherine<br>tazzard described the role of lawyers in<br>these terms<br>members of the legal profession assist<br>individuals to pursue their rights and<br>honour their obligations under the law<br>the balanced bare-minded and often<br>conservative advice provided by lawyers<br>is a necessary part of our<br>constitutional framework<br>it's often the task of lawyers to tell<br>people what they don't wish to adhere i<br>can attest to that this requires a<br>tough-mindedness<br>that is most often first developed<br>within their legal education<br>law schools do have a responsibility to<br>educate their students<br>with an understanding of the role they<br>play within the community and their<br>responsibilities to that community<br>the philosophy of waikato law school and<br>the university of waikato will prepare<br>their students to meet the challenges<br>facing our community<br>so 30 years ago then the expectations<br>were high that waikato law school would<br>make a difference to legal education and<br>the role of lawyers in our communities<br>and societies<br>this paper is not going to review<br>whether those expectations have been<br>fulfilled<br>the take far too long in this context to<br>do that<br>for me however the best review<br>for any educational institution is the<br>students it produces<br>some of whom are here tonight<br>and they in fact are testimony to the<br>success<br>of the program<br>a look at the alumni tells us that<br>and i think would indicate the value and<br>contribution the slow school has made to<br>the legal community<br>it's important however not to forget<br>that the influence of tapering<br>has had on legal education in new<br>zealand generally we've just heard one<br>example even though it takes 30 years<br>but shortly after lecture started i<br>organised<br>a host and hosted a conference on legal<br>education to which all other law<br>faculties were invited<br>it was an opportunity to explain our<br>curriculum<br>and i noted after the event that other<br>law faculties incorporated some of our<br>initiatives<br>into their degree programs legal<br>philosophy dispute resolution to name<br>but a few and of course the importance<br>of taytoriti<br>i'm not sure if such a conference on<br>legal education has been held recently<br>and i fear the competitive environment<br>amongst universities may make such<br>events difficult it was difficult at<br>that time we were seen as competitors<br>i note however that recently<br>tape arena has continued its reputation<br>for innovation<br>with the development of the law style<br>guide act this is a real and major<br>achievement it may not seem so for those<br>of us who actually research and study<br>law it's a major breakthrough let me<br>tell you within our world this is very<br>significant<br>i thought this evening however i'd say a<br>few words about the challenges facing<br>legal educators in a society that has<br>become increasingly divided more<br>specifically i want to discuss why<br>the role of law is important to a<br>society that supports democratic<br>principles and values<br>i'll also argue that taper ringer is<br>well placed to prepare our students for<br>the challenges that such individuals in<br>the community face and will continue to<br>face and therefore will be able to<br>fulfill the expectation of the early<br>founders<br>i'm pleased to say that a recent seminar<br>organised by juliet and alberta on the<br>faculty that had a presentation with<br>timothy lindsay on the role of<br>independence<br>in the rule of law and the legal<br>profession was in my view in the<br>tapering a tradition of preparing our<br>students for the role in the community<br>although the term rule of law is<br>frequently used it's not always clear<br>what it means in practice<br>fundamentally the use of the rule of law<br>is seen as a means actually to resolve<br>conflict and avert violence through an<br>accepted set of principles and values<br>all of the<br>notion has was founded and the peacemal<br>revolution of<br>conflict can be traced back to the<br>writings of greek philosophers for those<br>of us who were educated in the english<br>common law tradition the concept is<br>associated with dicey the english jurist<br>who argued no person is punishable or<br>lawfully can be made to suffer<br>except through breach of law established<br>in the ordinary manner<br>that is through normal legislative<br>processes<br>and that no person is above the law and<br>that every person is subject to the<br>ordinary law of the land<br>i thought of this principle during the<br>recent controversy where the former<br>members of parliament should be subject<br>to a pr trespass order after they<br>breached those orders during the<br>protests outside parliament and was very<br>pleased i was not the speaker i would<br>have made one of those rules-based<br>decisions that would have been<br>extraordinarily unpopular<br>however dicey i must say also emphasized<br>there is an importance and respect not<br>only for the law but for judicial<br>decision-making as part of that notion<br>dicey when developing his views on the<br>rule of law with an english society at<br>the time<br>was<br>faced with the established institutions<br>of power being challenged by those<br>outside the power structures working<br>people were forming political parties<br>trade unions and demanding a say in the<br>laws that govern them women were also<br>demanding the right to be part of<br>decision-making political plus<br>the increasing conflict in society<br>therefore provided an environment to<br>seek an acceptable regulatory framework<br>to manage conflict<br>an appeal to the legal framework had<br>appealed to a society that lacked a<br>written constitution embedding such<br>principles<br>and values<br>but the concept<br>of law rule of law relied on a set of<br>process rules it didn't make assumption<br>but they were based on the process the<br>way in which you actually apply the law<br>but they were grounded on the notion of<br>the equality of people<br>that is all people being treated the<br>same according to the law<br>the elements of the rule of law then are<br>associated with democratic practice and<br>institutions that enact the laws that<br>apply to us equally<br>unless proper democratic<br>practice is applied when electing our<br>representatives to govern in parliament<br>or i would say local government the laws<br>made in parliament or in your local<br>chamber<br>then they will lack legitimacy unless<br>those rules are followed<br>this is why our electoral rules are so<br>important<br>especially in new zealand that lacks a<br>written constitution it's why the rules<br>of parliament<br>that define the process of making laws<br>are important<br>these rules known to few are currently<br>being reviewed by the standing orders<br>committee and are open for public<br>submission<br>the fact these rules are made by elected<br>representative<br>makes the election of those<br>representatives even more important if<br>you want a practical example of how the<br>notion of the rule of law can be slowly<br>undermined you need only look at what is<br>happening in the united states<br>republican controlled state assemblies<br>are steadily changing who can vote where<br>people can vote and how they can vote<br>this of course will have an impact on<br>future elections<br>challenging these new laws has become<br>constrained however through the<br>politicisation of their judiciary<br>a recent release of the draft<br>supreme court decision on the right to<br>abortion<br>has raised the whole question whether a<br>judge's political ideology is more<br>important than their legal knowledge or<br>judgment<br>the end result of the politicization of<br>law making process will be the<br>legitimacy legitimacy of the laws made<br>through institutions where<br>representatives do not reflect the<br>communities to be governed by the rule<br>of law<br>what we may be watching is a development<br>of the notion of rule by law<br>not rule of law<br>rule by law<br>is common in countries governed by<br>authoritarian regimes<br>basically this means if laws are made by<br>institutions that are not legitimately<br>democratically elected<br>then the laws passed by that institution<br>will not be legitimate<br>in this context it's interesting to note<br>that the recent challenge in new zealand<br>to the legitimacy of the laws enacted to<br>regulate<br>covet 19 pandemic<br>most of those challenges have used the<br>traditional route<br>of filing actions in the courts and<br>there were several<br>arguments have been centered on the<br>authority of the government to enact<br>laws that in one form another have<br>affected the rights of citizens<br>these arguments have usually invoked the<br>new zealand bill of rights act or relied<br>on the rule relating to judicial review<br>to ensure the government or government<br>agency followed the correct process for<br>enactment<br>the basic issue is a balancing of<br>individual and community legal rights as<br>interpreted by the courts i don't intend<br>here you'll be relieved to know to give<br>an examination of those cases as i'm<br>sure there'll be much academic legal<br>analysis<br>they were however a test of the<br>legitimate authority of the government<br>to make the rules<br>of the whole society and the system<br>seems to have worked<br>for some<br>however there was however another<br>challenge to the government's legitimacy<br>to enact these laws the protest outside<br>parliament highlighted the direct<br>challenge to the government<br>although the original focus of the<br>protest appeared to be the removal of<br>measures to prevent the spread of the<br>virus<br>it morphed into a general protest<br>against the government exec itself on<br>the grounds it lacked legitimacy to make<br>laws<br>what has emerged from these group is the<br>notion of the sovereign citizen<br>to take action to pursue their interests<br>that are to be enforced by their<br>sheriffs<br>this movement has adopted the use of the<br>terms such as sovereign common law and<br>sheriffs that appear to appeal to some<br>notion of historical english rights<br>it's interesting that the leaders of<br>these rights resort to the notion<br>of the law for legitimacy<br>what they fail to do however is explain<br>who confers this legitimacy<br>on the chosen few<br>to make laws for others in other words<br>their challenge is essentially to<br>democratic process<br>as much as it is to the government<br>representatives of the day<br>should be worried about such views<br>i would argue that new zealand has<br>always been a highly contested political<br>and ideological environment<br>so any response i would only say<br>should also take account that it's<br>important that we also maintain a<br>democratic commitment to free speech<br>and if we attempted to change that then<br>we should be careful of what happens<br>when you<br>tend to suppress the views of others<br>manage regulate but never suppress<br>however as legal educators we have a<br>responsibility to teach our students the<br>rules that will enable them to respond<br>to such challenges knowledge and<br>understanding of legal rules is<br>essential to enable us to professionally<br>represent our clients<br>this knowledge was one of the three<br>foundation po<br>of<br>approach to legal education without that<br>fundamental knowledge of the legal<br>system we can't professionally represent<br>our clients or explain why obeying the<br>law is important not only to the<br>well-being of the client but also to the<br>community<br>a reading of the law however does not<br>always provide a clear answer some of us<br>have noticed to the infinite variety of<br>human behaviors this is why we have<br>rules for interpreting the law and<br>appointed individuals the judges<br>who hear arguments and make decision on<br>the meaning of the law in a specific set<br>of circumstances<br>maintenance of the integrity of this<br>process is essential for the rule of law<br>to govern the behaviour of all parties<br>all participants must believe the system<br>is fair<br>even if their argument does not prevail<br>the notion that everyone is treated<br>equally under the same rules contributes<br>to the fairness of the system<br>it is not the only element<br>but it is important as is the<br>recognition that laws must be<br>interpreted<br>and applied in their context<br>increasingly it's recognized that while<br>we must be treated equally<br>when before the law<br>we do not always come to the law as<br>equals social economic and cultural<br>factors<br>contribute to how and why we seek the<br>judgment of the law<br>increasingly new zealand society has<br>recognized one side does not fit all<br>and we must accommodate the diversity<br>within our society within our own legal<br>system while preserving the fundamental<br>elements of the rule of law that tonight<br>that unite us as a community<br>the development of human rights law is<br>an obvious example of how we have tried<br>to accommodate difference and inequality<br>within our legal system another more<br>recent development is the incorporation<br>of tai tariti within the legal system<br>taiparinga was founded on this principle<br>30 years ago and through its graduates<br>and research has contributed to this<br>slow but inevitable development<br>the challenge at the moment to this<br>development comes from those who fear<br>we are developing competing systems of<br>governance and of law<br>that will be divisive<br>an answer to this concern is an<br>understanding of the concepts underlying<br>the rule of law as being inclusive but<br>not always at the moment definitive<br>as the values that underlie maori<br>culture are becoming better understood<br>it's time to explore the notion of the<br>rule of law<br>within the concept of a maori value<br>system i'm no expert on maori values or<br>culture but we must look for common<br>values rather than differences when<br>developing our legal system<br>the current debate on tatariti in a<br>post-colonial context provides an<br>excellent opportunity<br>to build a more inclusive notion of the<br>rule of law and i would argue that those<br>who have benefited from a tapering<br>legal education are well suited to<br>contribute to that development enough<br>from me i want to thank you for the<br>opportunity to be part of the 30th<br>anniversary and to affirm the founding<br>principles has been still<br>valid today<br>taper ringer and the university should<br>be proud of its staff and graduates<br>who are providing leadership in our<br>society<br>that develops<br>a legal system that is inclusive of all<br>thank you<br>oh<br>i've just been told there are questions<br>but forgot that i used to be a teacher<br>thank you vice chancellor one always<br>needs advice from someone wiser<br>right<br>questions anyone have any comments or<br>questions<br>i hope it wasn't a bit heavy i thought<br>it might be<br>but you can't take the intellectual out<br>of the girl really it<br>i'm sure not everyone agrees but i<br>thought it was important to to try and<br>put a context<br>around<br>what is happening in toporinga and it<br>was challenging at the beginning because<br>it was so new to be honest<br>it's not so new now but the principles<br>remain the same there is just a<br>different context<br>and i think that's what i was trying to<br>say that<br>waikato university enabled those values<br>and<br>tata riki in fact would never have<br>happened without the leadership at the<br>university of waikato at the time<br>and having laid down a principal basis<br>and it's interesting i don't think<br>there's any other law school in new<br>zealand<br>that has such a guiding principled basis<br>for what they do normally<br>law schools emerge often as i was saying<br>to someone before from mathematics<br>departments god help us anyway i'm sure<br>that was important but it's<br>other disciplines<br>we emerged and developed but here we did<br>it all<br>according to the law and an inclusive<br>law<br>good<br>thank you yes marie<br>marion<br>is<br>an easy question thank you very much<br>i i suspect it will still be challenging<br>if it remains in other words<br>for me the new challenge is technology<br>to to be honest i think it's also<br>the issues relating to our constitution<br>as a people and finding a way through we<br>have in the past and i'm sure we can but<br>we have to keep on<br>evolving and developing<br>who is involved in that decision making<br>and i think taparin make a really good<br>contribution there i think on technology<br>also for what it's worth um<br>because<br>i i wouldn't like to predict where we're<br>going i merely hope that mr musk doesn't<br>quite succeed with twitter but then i<br>think maybe he will destroy twitter so<br>who knows<br>so you you're going to have all those<br>issues about free speech as i mentioned<br>about<br>exactly who has access<br>and<br>the divisions in society will probably<br>come as much from technology in my view<br>as they will from anything else<br>so<br>and that will be a resource question to<br>some extent actually as well so very<br>important that we in fact have people<br>who understand that<br>so the lawyers that hopefully come from<br>us will be raising these questions<br>we'll be defending<br>people in court<br>saying what about us this is a new set<br>of circumstances this is a new way to<br>look<br>at how we're going to consider the facts<br>how we're going to interpret the law<br>pushing the boundaries i hope is what<br>we'll be doing and i don't see why we<br>shouldn't you can only fail to find that<br>you're actually successful 30 years<br>later<br>you know i mean that's the point really<br>um<br>probably not actually but i think um<br>the way in which that division is<br>expressed is<br>widely spread in a way<br>i think we fool ourselves if we don't<br>understand our own history<br>and the divisions that they have been<br>within our society<br>and i guess i say this partly as an<br>employment lawyer some of the struggles<br>that that working people have had in<br>this country<br>most people wouldn't believe today<br>the first strikes in new zealand were by<br>maori workers<br>you know i mean as you you see the the<br>evolution and development and we're not<br>good in our own history<br>that would be my view i see now in<br>schools we are going to get a version of<br>it so one only hopes it's an inclusive<br>version but i i support<br>the thoughts behind that<br>but i think the way in which it's<br>expressed is different and that's about<br>the technology<br>um i think<br>that worry me more and therefore how you<br>manage to put a contestable view out<br>there<br>that that's going to be what's who<br>controls in fact social media becomes<br>really important<br>and it's privately controlled not<br>publicly controlled<br>i think it has to be challenging of the<br>students to think outside the norm<br>just because the presidents tell you one<br>thing doesn't mean you can't<br>think about that you can be respectful<br>of it and where it comes from but does<br>it really fit this case<br>and therefore is there another way now<br>the law only develops and maintains<br>legitimacy because it does evolve and<br>develop and we do that through two ways<br>we do it by producing judges who get<br>good legal education<br>and for which we do at tapering we<br>produce judges too<br>but we also do it through sending people<br>and i hate to say this off to parliament<br>to be able to legislate the laws<br>that in fact will be interpreted<br>so we in other words we contribute to<br>the public life as well as the private<br>citizens life of all the<br>myriad of problems we have in our lives<br>that we need a lawyer for<br>so i think that's<br>that's to me is important just push the<br>envelope constantly knowing what your<br>client really is<br>being able to relate to your client and<br>work often behind what's really<br>worrying the client and then looking at<br>the context within which that is<br>and most of the breakthroughs come i<br>think from lawyers in fact pushing the<br>boundaries now you won't always be<br>thanked<br>and dame catherine was right when she<br>said that you'll not always think but<br>that's your job is to say what people<br>don't want to hear as long as it's<br>obviously<br>and then recently graduated here in 2020<br>was it by design or a necessity around<br>having one restrictive entry<br>through the law school and how do you<br>um<br>it's a very interesting question that<br>that should be explored in a better<br>context of more knowledge but my gut<br>feeling is<br>i first experienced this when i was at<br>unrestricted entry when i went through<br>which is why most of us became lawyers<br>actually<br>some of those who we employed wondered<br>how<br>um<br>and then they restricted they restricted<br>entry from about the mid seventies and<br>suddenly the number of women exploded in<br>law because they had better grades<br>and that's how you got the imbalance as<br>some people saw it<br>in legal education between male and<br>females at least at auckland<br>um<br>over time i'm not sure that has evened<br>out or not but i found that quite<br>interesting here our experience was<br>um the vice chancellor may recall but<br>there's always caps on money so how many<br>in fact you you can have in terms of<br>students<br>the decision was made to have a<br>a different open entry i suppose and how<br>we dip it there was no maori quota<br>this was only the law school that did<br>not have a mario pacific or any other<br>sort of quota that i thought was<br>extraordinarily important<br>i had no problem at all that we would in<br>fact attract students if not the first<br>year<br>but through at least the first cycle<br>sufficient to equate with the number<br>within maori within our region it seemed<br>to me that you've got to take time<br>you've got to build it you've got to do<br>it properly so that distinguished us at<br>the time<br>and i think also what was different<br>is it wasn't only on grades there were<br>in fact places for people<br>mainly young men who had left school at<br>15 to pursue other more exciting<br>activities<br>but came back to realize they needed a<br>qualification and maybe they'd try law<br>and after a bumpy first year or so they<br>did extraordinarily well<br>just did extraordinary well they needed<br>support and help<br>now that was<br>a very interview and we were um<br>criticized for that there were questions<br>in parliament about about who god got in<br>and who didn't<br>um but it it seemed to me there were<br>people who had missed out<br>on a legal education<br>um through sometimes quite arbitrary<br>criteria<br>now in those days maybe the financial<br>constraints were perhaps not as great<br>and we had some flexibility i don't know<br>but certainly open entry seems to me if<br>you can maintain it is extremely<br>important but also looking at more than<br>grades<br>i don't know what others feel and i took<br>comfort in this fact where often<br>practitioners told me at the time<br>those with a grades did not make the<br>best lawyers<br>those with c grades didn't really either<br>but maybe in the criminal bar i was once<br>told<br>but those who came in the middle were<br>just perfect<br>for<br>my name is neil quigley i'm the vice<br>chancellor of the university it's my<br>great pleasure to<br>be here this evening<br>first to help celebrate the 30 years of<br>it's a great part of this university<br>and<br>for all of the reasons really that that<br>margaret has so<br>ably enunciated in her talk this evening<br>including<br>the very helpful question on open entry<br>because<br>i've of course worked at<br>universities where there were degrees<br>that didn't have open entry of course<br>they tend to be used to bring a lot of<br>students into a degree for which there<br>is excess demand and then channel many<br>of those students into a degree that<br>they didn't really want to take uh in<br>the first place<br>and so it's a really important part of<br>this university's tradition that we<br>don't do that uh here<br>and i think it's a great thing for the<br>culture of the university and of course<br>enormously to the advantage of our<br>students<br>because through that system<br>the best students always do emerge<br>and you don't need the sort of filter at<br>first year that many universities have<br>to to achieve that<br>so<br>i'm delighted to to be here<br>to help you celebrate i'm also<br>delighted to have the opportunity<br>to speak at the end of margaret's<br>lecture since i came here to waikato<br>margaret has been<br>the most<br>incredibly supportive colleague<br>source of<br>advice and encouragement<br>as i've worked my way through my share<br>of interesting and challenging issues<br>and margaret your support for me is so<br>much appreciated uh thank you<br>so um<br>i won't<br>i won't delay you<br>uh any further i i have um<br>not taken rahui's advice and put a<br>restriction on the bar tab for the for<br>the closing uh so<br>so uh that that's open uh margaret uh<br>apparently i bought you some flowers<br>and uh that's kind of you all right yeah<br>i thought so too yes yes very good<br>let me fit those<br>okay there we go<br>uh<br>it's okay you can grab my arm and come<br>okay it's<br>ladies and gentlemen what an honor and a<br>pleasure to listen to margaret wilson<br>30 years worth of memories and didn't<br>again ladies and gentlemen uh as uh<br>professor quigley uh he said he hasn't<br>put restrictions on the bar tab so it's<br>before we invite everyone back to have<br>some refreshments uh in some kind here<br>you know what an absolutely fantastic<br>way to celebrate 30 years of debating a<br>faculty of law and just to reiterate the<br>words de nakutu thank you all for your<br>participation this evening both in<br>person and online<br>and<br>may the next 30 years be just as strong<br>without the speed bumps that margaret<br>foreign<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
