thank you for joining this New Zealand Sign Language webinar<br>my name is Micky Vale and I work in the deaf studies research unit here at Victoria University of Wellington and I'm <br>responsible for looking after our online resources  <br>I'll be the host for today's webinar and that focuses on those resources that will help you learn and use NZSL<br>we'll be using the Q&amp;A function so if you'd like to submit a question based on what you hear today just type it in and then <br>I'll aim to answer as many questions as possible  <br>at the end of this session and the session will <br>also be recorded so it will be available later<br>now if you saw my colleague Sara's webinar on <br>Monday then you'll already have taken a first step towards learning NZSL<br>and if everyone took the time to learn just a few simple phrases that would make a big difference to deaf people's daily lives<br>and if you then wanted to take it further an excellent choice would be to attend a NZSL class with a qualified deaf teacher<br>and I will show you where to find out about local classes later<br>but if a regular class is not an option for you and you do want to make a start then we've got this great alternative called learn NZSL<br>Learn NZSL is a complete beginner's <br>course it's freely available<br>it has nine topics that will help you use NZSL <br>in everyday life each topic has four sections <br>there are words which teaches you <br>some vocabulary to do with the topic<br>in the phrases section you will learn to combine <br>these words following the grammar of NZSL<br>then in a conversation you will be shown <br>the context to use those phrases in<br>and finally the wrap-up session sums <br>it all up and tests your understanding  <br>there are hundreds of videos on the site <br>and it also has quizzes fun activities  <br>and includes cultural hints and appropriate <br>communication behaviours as well  <br>and the learn NZSL practice community <br>on Facebook will link you in with other learners<br>so there are self-organised zoom meetups and other practice sessions as well<br>and you can ask questions from people who are learning alongside you<br>now on to a resource that many of <br>you may already be familiar with the NZSL online dictionary<br>this is available online on this website here<br>and also as a mobile app both for apple operating system and for android<br>but do be aware that the mobile app has more limited offline capacity so it won't show the videos offline<br>one useful feature for learners is that there is a sign of the day  <br>and you can click on that to show other signs as well<br>so that's a a great way to keep up daily practice<br>you can search both by Te reo Maori or English translations of the sign<br>but the dictionary is bi-directional which means <br>that you can also search for signs that you have seen<br>where you don't know what the meaning might be<br>so you can choose the handshape of a sign<br>and its location<br>and then you will be shown the search results of <br>any signs that match that handshape and location<br>you can also search by topic and there <br>are a lot of topics to browse through  <br>you can find those in the advanced search <br>or at the top of the page and the topics<br>there are also some usage categories so if you're looking for very rare signs or  <br>very new signs or informal signs you can find those there as well<br>if you click on learn more in any of the search results you will be taken to a full page of information for that sign<br>here you can play the videos you can play them in slow motion<br>or at normal speed<br>or you can play them full screen<br>there is also an example sentence <br>showing the sign in context  <br>and underneath that you will <br>find as well as a translation  <br>there are also some blue hyperlinks so if you see <br>any other signs in the example sentence that you  <br>want to look up just click on those and you'll <br>be taken to the information page about that sign<br>you will also find some grammatical information <br>for example that this sign can be produced with  <br>one or two hands and that it can be inflected <br>in particular ways if you wonder what these  <br>terms mean then just click on the link <br>and it will take you to the help page<br>there are often multiple search results and that's <br>because there are often a variety of signs in use  <br>for the same concept<br>the usage information in some science will tell you why there are certain variants<br>but if you're not given any other information then you can assume that the sign that shows up first in the search results is often the most frequently used<br>so unless you are in a class or you know deaf people personally in which case follow their lead follow what they use  <br>otherwise you can usually assume that <br>the first sign is the most frequent<br>the usage information if there is any <br>about a sign will be shown on the sign page  <br>you can play the videos directly from the search results  <br>but you can also play them like I showed before on the page itself<br>now the next exciting thing we can do is download <br>these drawings or create our own vocabulary sheets<br>you can add multiple signs either directly from <br>the search results or from the information page  <br>and then when we view the vocab sheet we can reorder the signs<br>we can change the translations<br>and you can also give it a title<br>you can choose different layouts<br>there's also a notes page in case <br>you wanted to make your own notes<br>and you can then download the vocab <br>sheets as a PDF or print them out directly<br>so I hope you can see how useful the <br>dictionary can be as a learning aid  <br>just remember that learning a language involves <br>more than just learning the words or in this  <br>case the science you need to make sure you <br>also pick up something about the grammar  <br>and you'll find some grammatical information <br>in the tabs that I'll show you shortly  <br>and if you join my colleague Rachel McKee's <br>webinar on Friday you will have the chance  <br>to get another taster of some of the most <br>interesting grammatical aspects of NZSL<br>the dictionary shows information <br>about finger-spelling<br>also about numbers<br>because there are complex number systems<br>and about something called classifiers<br>in the bottom tab you can be taken <br>to the download pages for the app  <br>and there's also information <br>about into the self facts<br>some learning activities and some other links<br>now there may be some concepts that you're trying to talk about in NZSL<br>but when you look in the dictionary you can't find the <br>sign for them<br>it's only relatively recently that NZSL has started to be used in a larger variety of contexts<br>before that time just like Te reo Maori it has a history of being <br>actively banned in schools<br>and so although it's now recognised as an official language of New Zealand it is also still revitalising and growing  <br>the online dictionary does try to keep up with <br>newly developing science in fact we've just added  <br>150 additional signs last month and that includes <br>signs such as COVID 19 and mask and other signs  <br>that have become unfortunately all too common  <br>but before a sign is added to the dictionary we do check whether it's in widespread use<br>and we ask the deaf community members to validate them<br>but in the meantime there's quite a lot of information <br>in the dictionary that we need to added<br>and so it may take a while for those signs to appear in the dictionary<br>so what do you do in the meantime?<br>well this is where NZSL share comes in<br>NZSL share is an online community space where new signs can be shared and discussed the signs that you see here for example<br>these recently added signs  <br>are contributed by the deaf community <br>themselves so by people who use NZSL every day  <br>you can see that more than 500 signs have already <br>been added in the past two years and all the signs  <br>can be viewed and then reordered so <br>that you see the most recent ones first <br>as well as the topics that you <br>saw in the online dictionary  <br>there are also some new topics to browse here  <br>and that ranges from digital technology where <br>we will probably expect quite a few new signs<br>to the name signs for famous <br>people to space and astronomy<br>and also the deaf education provider Ko Taku Reo <br>has also added some glossaries for curriculum  <br>terms and more are to come this year<br>you will also find signs for things that are at the forefront of people's minds such as current events and news like the cannabis debate or COVID 19.  <br>when you search for a sign you'll also see if there is already a sign for the concept in the dictionary with the same meaning<br>if there are both dictionary signs and community signs then use the dictionary sign in preference because those have gone through our validation process<br>again there's more information if you actually click on a particular sign<br>so just like in the dictionary you can see the video itself but you can also go to  <br>more information about the sign here you can see that there are ticks for how many people  <br>agree and disagree with that particular sign that option is available to approved users<br>so a fluent NZSL users who can comment on each other's signs<br>the person uploading the sign can also add extra information<br>so for example this person has provided a background of whether she goes to sign and an example sentence<br>and then you'll be able to read the comments <br>that other people have made about these signs<br>as learners of NZSL you can also set up an account<br>and that allows you to save the <br>signs you see in private folders  <br>or even upload your own private <br>videos that you can share with others <br>so you can set up lots of folders you can <br>collaborate with other people in those folders  <br>and this handy icon here will allow you to add <br>signs to those folders for easy reference later<br>you can find out more about <br>the website in your own time  <br>on the about link and make sure to check the <br>rules for usage and our privacy policy as well  <br>we also have a Facebook group called NZSL share <br>requests and that is where you can ask about  <br>signs that you haven't found in the dictionary <br>yet and if there are signs in use in the deaf  <br>community then hopefully one of our approved <br>members will upload that sign to NZSL share <br>we've got some more improvements <br>coming to the site this year <br>so keep checking in to the website regularly<br>now if you wanted to take your NZSL journey further<br>then Victoria University of Wellington has a range of NZSL papers at first second and third year level<br>and you can find out about those at this link<br>if you wanted to take a community education class or find a tutor for face-to-face or online classes then the teach sign website<br>has those details of qualified tutors along with <br>homework activities and other useful resources  <br>happy NZSL week and happy learning<br>thank you.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
