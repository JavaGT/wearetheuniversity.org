I'm ready to start teaching you so flex your hands and get ready<br>you'll see that I've got a laptop here and I'm going to click on this just to show you some simple phrases and words<br>I'm going to model signs for you and you can copy and have a go<br>so please do copy me as you watch along and sign with me nobody's watching you<br>so feel free to do your thing and go have a practice<br>before I start I'll just teach you <br>one key sign which is this again  <br>it looks like a number two but it's <br>signed this way and if you see me sign again<br>that means I want you to try it <br>again okay that's a key sign for teaching<br>now in case you're wondering which hand to use<br>I will advise you that if you write with your right hand if you're right-hander<br>then that will be your dominant hand so you sign like again you would do it on a left hand<br>if you're a left-hander then your dominant hand would be your left hand<br>so you need to know which is your dominant hand and then use that to follow me<br>so we've done again moving on<br>good morning<br>that's simple<br>hearing people as well as deaf people use this gesture for a good<br>and morning represents the idea of a sunrise<br>and you can see the circle of the sun rising above the horizon<br>so let's do that phrase good morning<br>okay<br>good morning<br>tomorrow morning you can tell your <br>partner or somebody that you like good morning<br>give it a go<br>next phrase<br>hi how are you<br>all one signed<br>notice that this one sign<br>translates as how are you<br>as I said before<br>sign language isn't the same structure as English often will have combined <br>meanings in one sign<br>so we translate how are you but it's really one sign<br>okay I hope your hands are getting warmed up next one<br>okay for yourself point yourself I 'm good<br>I'm good<br>it's easy<br>the next one<br>tired I'm tired<br>tired<br>okay I'll show you the role <br>play the dialogue<br>hi how are you<br>I'm good or hi how are you<br>I'm tired<br>okay and next<br>already you've learned this first <br>person pronoun<br>you can use that again to point yourself and name<br>the name with this hand-shape<br>in English we use the word is in a sentence like this but not in NZSL it works differently<br>so my name<br>and then you would finger-spell your name<br>there are lots of posters and resources online where you can learn the alphabet<br>I'm not going to take the time to teach the alphabet today because it's 26 letters it will take a little while<br>but let's try that again<br>my name<br>and then spell your name<br>my name<br>again<br>my name<br>as I said before sign language grammar works a little bit differently<br>so in English you have a sentence like what's your name but in NZSL the order is different  <br>literally it would be name <br>you what or you name what<br>again<br>now I'll do a little role play for your <br>dialogue<br>hi what's your name<br>my name is<br>okay simple<br>perhaps you might run into a deaf person in a shop or a deaf person someone you can ask them<br>are you deaf<br>using this two-fingered handshape again I'll do it straight on here<br>are you deaf<br>just two signs<br>you deaf<br>and the deaf person would be surprised if they saw you say that they might start signing to you<br>but it's always a good question to <br>ask a person if you think they are deaf<br>are you deaf<br>and if a deaf person starts signing to you after you've asked them that you can say this<br>I'm learning sign<br>the sign for learn shows something <br>coming into your brain<br>or you're picking up something and putting it into your brain<br>I'm learning sign<br>one more time<br>if you're having communication difficulties where the person you think is deaf you can say this<br>a deaf person might not and be <br>pleased or they might have some  <br>paper with them or you can get <br>some paper we'll sign that again<br>just point you and write on paper <br>you write with your eyebrows raised  <br>which makes it a question and that's a really useful phrase<br>deaf people will often ask in a shock they'll do that they'll say can you write<br>and a person working the shop might be puzzled but<br>the meaning of write looks <br>fairly obvious doesn't it<br>and the last phrase which everyone needs to know<br>is thank you<br>from this angle thank you<br>thank you<br>make sure you don't sign up from your <br>lips because people might misinterpret and get the wrong message that you're blowing in a kiss  <br>or from under your chin which could be a rude gesture in some cultures<br>so touching your chin<br>so I showed you 10 phrases today and if you forget them that's okay this video is recorded<br>and when the webinars are finished you will be sent a link so you can always watch them again and try again  <br>with me<br>one of my other colleagues here Micky will be giving a webinar on Wednesday<br>and she's going to be showing you some really useful resources that are online for learning in NZSL independently<br>so now I'd like to before we close just briefly talk about how NZSL users are managing in the time of masks<br>which has been a new experience for us during the pandemic<br>so there's two different challenges for us<br>one is when a deaf person meets a hearing person in a shop or a public situation<br>and they are wearing masks<br>of course we can't lipread not all deaf people are adept at lipreading<br>but even if they aren't still it's very difficult to communicate when a person has a mask on<br>and then there's in the deaf community when deaf people are communicating with one another in sign language<br>of course they can see the signing<br>but the language doesn't work as smoothly and fluently so we will <br>tend to take our masks off<br>if we're in a private space<br>we know in public we have to leave them <br>on but so there are two different issues for us<br>as you can see the face is really critical <br>for sign language it shows emotion  <br>it shows effect and emphasis<br>and if you sign without the face involved it's very dry<br>also the face in sign language is important for grammar and sign language as Rachel we'll talk about on Friday<br>sometimes also there is one sign which has more than one meaning<br>so for example this sign which means cake but in a different context it also <br>means a hospital<br>so the manual the hands part is the same but we require the mouth to differentiate those<br>so i'll put my mask on to show you what it's like<br>cake, hospital or something<br>you have no idea which one i'm actually saying<br>so deaf people are pretty <br>good at figuring out context  <br>but it's still a lot more effort <br>if we have to read through a mask  <br>so the ways that you can help in that situation if you're in a mask situation<br>is to learn a little bit of sign that's helpful<br>also to use pointing perhaps if you're talking about something that's around you in shock or in a situation<br>just point to something and that guides the deaf person to look at it and know what you're referring to<br>I know that in hearing culture pointing can sometimes be frowned upon or considered rude<br>but for deaf people it will be much appreciated<br>also using pen and paper writing is extremely useful<br>or you can do it on your phone or whatever you've got at your disposal<br>using gestures is also a great thing to do I know people might feel a bit embarrassed about using gestures<br>but think about simple gestures like money this for money<br>this can mean could link to how much or you need to pay me or just simple gestures<br>try and be creative that adds some meaning for deaf people<br>I know that in Anglo cultures sometimes using the hands is is not as comfortable for a lot of people<br>whereas in other countries gesture is used a lot more readily<br>but it's extremely helpful for whether or not you're wearing a mask<br>so I  hope that you know as we go back to normal times and masking becomes less  <br>present that will become less of an issue for us but now I think it's time to wrap up<br>I hope you've learned something today maybe a few signs<br>phrases<br>what it's like the deaf people in the pandemic<br>and I just want to thank my interpreter <br>for interpreting<br>and I hope that you will go on to learn a few more signs and maybe you'll have a chance in your life to use them<br>it's fantastic if people know a little bit of this official language<br>thank you and happy NZSL week to you.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
