Why not? well my answer to that is how and why could any language be universally developed and used and passed on<br>language communities of course arise in places with particular histories among local networks of people<br>and localness is especially true for languages that are used only in a face-to-face form that haven't historically been in print or  in broadcast media<br>so we're just taking a quick look at the signs for two concepts man and woman across four national sign languages<br>confirms quite clearly that the universality of science is really a myth<br>you can see that in Japanese, American, Pakistani, New Zealand sign languages the sign for man takes completely different forms<br>and the sign for women takes completely different forms<br>so just the simple difference in vocabulary blows <br>the myth that it's a worldwide universal language<br>another very common idea about sign languages is <br>that they're based on the words and the grammar of a spoken language<br>almost like a corresponding code for a language<br>well if we take a quick look at the vocabulary in sign languages this shows us that this is not the case<br>sign languages have independent ways of creating meaning<br>so for example in English for some reason the verb run can be used to express a range of meetings as you can see in these four phrases<br>run around, run a meeting, run away, run out<br>but in NZSL on the other hand there's a wider set of vocabulary to express each of these different meanings<br>using a different sign and a single sign for each of those types of meanings<br>the physical run to run a meeting to run away or to run out of something are completely<br>different concepts so they don't correspond to <br>the vocabulary of English in a one-to-one mapping  <br>sign languages have their own semantics or their <br>own ways of expressing meaning and often this is  <br>based on visual metaphors so since sign language <br>has developed in communities of deaf people  <br>precisely because they don't hear <br>a spoken language it's logical that  <br>sign languages are not going to arise <br>from or be based on a spoken language<br>signs are made with the hands and using sign <br>language involves the body and the face<br>and so it's quite often assumed that they're more or <br>less like gesture or mime or visual imagery<br>which is fairly transparent or obvious in meaning <br>and there is some truth to this<br>because sign languages of course do incorporate gestures from a surrounding culture and they do use elements of  <br>mime and imagery especially to describe actions or <br>spatial information but what makes sign languages  <br>languages is that they're used regularly by <br>a community of people who share conventional  <br>rules for combining parts of that language <br>to create specific meanings in the same  <br>way that you would combine words and <br>grammatical structures in English to  <br>make yourself understood to other speakers <br>so we don't improvise languages we go along  <br>in signed or spoken language you have to learn and <br>know the symbols or the words and you have to know  <br>the structures and how it fits together to use it <br>and understand it now we're going to take a look  <br>at how sign language grammar uses the features of <br>the face and space in particular linguistic ways<br>as I've said sign languages exploit the <br>possibilities of a visual medium to create grammar  <br>in ways that make visual sense so one example of <br>this is that the face signals the syntax or the  <br>intent of a sentence a statement and a question <br>are often differentiated not by the order of the  <br>signs or words but actually by what's happening on <br>the face so as you can see in these illustrations  <br>a closed or a question that expects a yes or <br>no answer is shown by raised brows while open  <br>questions or those that are seeking information <br>are signalled by a brow frown or lowered eyebrows  <br>notice that the top sentence without the raised <br>brows would be a statement meaning I've finished  <br>work it only becomes a question when the brows <br>are raised so that's a syntactic use of the face  <br>to express the intent of a question you might also <br>notice if you look at the literal signs here which  <br>are work finish and name what that they seem to <br>be lacking a second person pronoun well that's  <br>because when a signer addresses a question <br>directly to someone that they're looking at  <br>the you meaning is assumed in that <br>direct eye gaze so there's no need  <br>to sign you are you finished work or what is <br>your name it's it's implicit in the eye gaze  <br>so this kind of facial grammar is quite <br>systematic and actually the question  <br>grammar using the eyebrows in some ways sort <br>of echoes natural facial gestures and also the  <br>type of vocal intonation that we use rising <br>or falling for different kinds of questions<br>the face is also used to add or build <br>up another layer of meaning with verbs  <br>so in English we use adverbs to express the way <br>or the manner in which an action is done such  <br>as to type carelessly to listen intently to walk <br>drunkenly but in NZSL the hands can carry the verb  <br>while the face carries an adverb so these three <br>pictures show different manners of writing  <br>the verb on the hands is to write and these <br>particular facial features are very commonly  <br>used with other verbs as well to express these <br>typical types of manner to do something in a  <br>relaxed fashion or to do something in a sloppy <br>inattentive fashion or to do something intensely<br>another kind of visual grammar that's found <br>in all sign languages actually is the use of  <br>specific facial expressions to describe things <br>more precisely especially degree or intensity  <br>and manner as we just said so here in this first <br>picture we see a signer describing very fine mist  <br>rising from the grass in the morning and the <br>quality of fineness or very fine as expressed  <br>by his mouth shape his pucket up mouth and his <br>narrowed eyes and that same expression can be  <br>applied to describing any very thin or fine object <br>in the second picture he's expressing a scorching  <br>hot sunny day or the sun shining very intensely <br>and the intensity of heat from the sun is shown  <br>by the combination of his mouth and his eyes <br>and that same sort of combination can be used  <br>with other adjectives to describe extremely far <br>or extremely big or extremely angry for example<br>also interesting in these pictures is that a <br>rather unique capacity of sign language grammar  <br>is that a signer can be describing an event <br>or an action or an object while also showing  <br>the perspective of a person observing it or <br>the object experiencing it so he's showing on  <br>his face something about the perspective of the <br>observer or the experiencer and of course that's  <br>possible because he can coordinate two ways of <br>articulating meaning on the face and on the hands<br>space is a very important grammatical resource <br>in New Zealand sign language<br>movement is a really efficient and economical way to <br>show the relationships between  <br>actors and actions so these pictures <br>show how a transitive verb such as give  <br>which involves a giver and a receiver can <br>use direction to show who's giving to whom  <br>using different points in the signing space to <br>represent first second and third-person pronouns  <br>so from the body outwards as I give to <br>you from the body out to one side as I give to a third person<br>or across the body is third-person gives to another third person<br>so this is an example of how signed sentences do <br>not correspond to spoken sentences because here  <br>we can see that one sign neatly contains three <br>elements of meaning by using space and movement<br>because signs exist in three-dimensional space and <br>science can move they naturally take advantage of  <br>this the ability to map signing space and <br>so the direction of movement is especially  <br>useful for representing actions that involve <br>someone else such as give or ask or explain or look at<br>and there are two parts of this firstly a signer will index or sort of set up points in their signing space by looking towards a certain direction<br>or by pointing to a reference in the signing space maybe to the left or the right or the centre<br>and then verbs or actions can be directed between those<br>so in the sentence that i'm going to show you in this short video the signer is saying<br>my children were sick and I took them to the doctor and explained to the doctor what was wrong with them<br>so I've put some little icons here to represent the perspective of the signer is the mother the first person<br>I the mother,  the children and the doctor and you can see where they're located literally in the signing space<br>and she will use three verbs she'll use take, go to and explain and you'll see how she directs them to the different entities in the space<br>the children were sick I took them went <br>to the doctor and explained to the doctor  <br>what was wrong with them<br>so you can see very clearly <br>how the signer has a mental  <br>map in her head of where the children are <br>and where the doctor are and then she makes  <br>these inflicting verbs agree with those directions <br>of the different parties and the person watching  <br>also of course has to build that mental map in <br>their head of the reference in this sentence<br>one interesting thing about our brains is that our <br>eyes can perceive and send a more complex package  <br>of visual information to the brain compared <br>to the amount of sound signals that we can  <br>hear and process in a simultaneous way so if you <br>compare say 20 seconds of looking at a picture  <br>and what you can retain compared to 20 seconds <br>of listening to music of what you can retain  <br>usually you'll have a lot more visual <br>detail because the brain can absorb that  <br>in a simultaneous rather than a linear fashion <br>and so because sign language is produced on the  <br>body and in space signers can take advantage of <br>this to express more than one bit of information at the same moment<br>which is why when we describe sign language syntax it's often not about word order as such but about the simultaneous combining of different elements<br>so in this slide we see examples from a travel narrative where the signer uses her two hands to express related pieces of information about one proposition or event<br>in the left-hand picture she's saying I flew up from Jamaica to Cuba<br>on her left hand she is flying with a plane on a south to north axis while she uses her right hand to point to to anchor the destination of Cuba  <br>so those two things can be expressed at the same <br>time while on her face you can see that she's  <br>also adding an adverb to express that the flight <br>was long and slow as in I flew all the way up to  <br>in the right hand picture she's holding a document <br>with her left hand to represent a visa but on her  <br>right hand she's signing nothing indicating that <br>she didn't have the document and again her face  <br>is actually expressing her perspective on that <br>situation so it's very simultaneous packaging of  <br>information using the two hands and the face <br>to express a lot of reference at the same time<br>the last thing I'd like to talk about is how sign <br>languages have the potential to represent abstract  <br>concepts in a visually metaphorical way so one <br>example of this is it's signs with time-related  <br>meaning use space and movement to talk about <br>time metaphorically as if it were an object  <br>that could be placed on a physical timeline <br>from left to right or from back to front  <br>also there's a lot of visual metaphor in verbs <br>so in in English where we might alter the meaning  <br>of a verb to make it negative or opposite we <br>could add a prefix such as um or miss such as  <br>understand misunderstand in sign language <br>we can use movement in a metaphorical way  <br>so at the top we have the same understand which <br>in itself is a metaphor it's the idea of something  <br>popping up in the head and in the sign next to it <br>went past my eyes this is a metaphor for an idea  <br>or information flying past the eyes so meaning <br>to not understand to misunderstand or to miss out  <br>on something because of course for a deaf person <br>understanding comes through the eyes so going past  <br>is metaphorically not taking in the information <br>on the lower half is the same communicate which  <br>is a metaphor for two-way exchange between <br>people and then for miscommunicate one of the  <br>hands drops out or falls down so the action of the <br>falling or the dropping metaphorically expresses  <br>to miscommunicate or communication to break <br>down so there are many ways that the vocabulary  <br>and the grammar of sign language can be visually <br>motivated and metaphorical in this way so that's  <br>all we have time for today in terms of grammar but <br>I hope it's been an interesting small glimpse into  <br>some of the ways that New Zealand sign language <br>grammar work thank you very much for coming.</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
