participants coming into<br>the zoom uh so we're just going to wait<br>a few minutes until we see a bit of a<br>plateau of attendees joining no my heart<br>am i and thank you for for uh for<br>joining us so we'll just wait a couple<br>spotlight series webinar uh it's a<br>pleasure to have you join us today um<br>we are<br>talking about mata ranga maori uh in the<br>talk titled mataranga maori here to stay<br>was spencer's suggestion actually<br>and<br>i'm really keen to uh to sort of talk<br>about mato rangamari from this this<br>particular angle<br>let me introduce myself and spencer more<br>i'm an associate professor at the<br>kawamawi the school of maori studies<br>here at te hiringawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>and i'm the host for today's session<br>um<br>joining me is uh associate professor<br>spencer lilly uh who's at the school of<br>information management uh and he comes<br>to academia from a long<br>career in uh and working in libraries<br>and information management and was a<br>former president or as a former<br>president of the library and uh<br>information association of museum of new<br>zealand<br>we first met uh when you were working at<br>messi university and<br>so it's a real pleasure to to share the<br>uh to share that the tu food today and<br>on this awesome kaupapa<br>uh so we'll be talking about matauranga<br>today from our different disciplines and<br>experiences with matarana<br>we'll talk we'll each go<br>do a presentation and we'll speak for<br>about 15 minutes each or so we may have<br>questions for each other<br>that naturally flow from each other's<br>presentations because i haven't seen<br>your talk yet and i'm looking forward to<br>it<br>there will be an opportunity for folks<br>on the webinar to ask questions at the<br>end<br>today we're using the q a function so if<br>you have a question<br>please type that into the the q a<br>section<br>in the q a box and if you like somebody<br>else's question and you want us to to<br>engage with that you can upvote it<br>and we'll aim to answer as many<br>questions as possible at the end of the<br>session<br>and we'll keep an eye on the time and<br>make sure we relieve time for that<br>um<br>so<br>without further ado i'll um i'll kick<br>off our session today with uh with my<br>presentation<br>and<br>so<br>here to stay was a pro tv program in<br>2007. maybe that's where you got the<br>idea from<br>on recent immigrants in aotearoa new<br>zealand and their<br>uh i guess experiences of um settling in<br>in aotearoa<br>i guess another uh alternative for this<br>talk could have been mataranga maori<br>nowhere else to go<br>um because of course there's uh there is<br>uh<br>nowhere for matador no other home for<br>water maori except<br>new zealand uh with a pacific strong<br>pacific basis um in the history of the<br>development of<br>matorana it is very much unique and of<br>this place<br>when i was googling here to stay cat<br>also came up with an idiom of something<br>new like blogging something that has<br>stopped being unusual it's kind of<br>become normalized and if i think about<br>mato maori<br>while at once upon a time was a maori a<br>normal and normalized<br>system of of knowledge um production and<br>a way of knowing uh that's not the case<br>today it has sort of been uh pushed out<br>to the margins but we want to<br>invite<br>um thought on on how we can secure mata<br>make it<br>make the<br>uh our current um social political<br>situation such that um<br>that this is a place where matarama can<br>thrive<br>so uh this one here<br>uh sorry for the wordy uh slide here but<br>uh this is a bit of a go-to slide for me<br>when i talk about mataranga to different<br>audiences<br>and<br>the dictionary definition talks about it<br>as being maori knowledge<br>but it doesn't stop there it's wisdom<br>understanding skill<br>uh education has more common use for<br>matauranga<br>one of the more historic uses for<br>mataranga was a sage and a scholar an<br>intellectual so a person could be a<br>mataranga<br>tahiri morkul mead the founding<br>professor of the kawamawi maori studies<br>talks about matarangosa philosophy and<br>more recently people talk about methods<br>and coca-cola maori as sort of lining up<br>and intertwining with mato<br>so<br>we are<br>feeling our way around the development<br>of matauranga as well as acknowledging<br>the history of it<br>in that history is one you know of<br>several hundred years of um of<br>occupation of the<br>polynesian<br>settlers and<br>their adaptation and um innovations in<br>relation to this place and<br>and coming to know it and to know<br>know the world and to be in this<br>particular world<br>and i<br>yeah so it's it's also uh while there<br>are some general uh generalizable<br>aspects of mataranga um<br>it's also an ewe and hapu a specific<br>knowledge system uh very much based in<br>local places and generated and from<br>and speaking to local places<br>values based relational<br>very important<br>that connections to matoranga<br>are<br>of both habu and ewi and people are<br>maintained and it has its own mana and<br>modi<br>i like this uh quote of thai hiding in<br>mokumed<br>mata ranga maori is not like an archive<br>of information or not just a data source<br>and as someone with a background of<br>science i am interested in mataranga and<br>it's what it has to to share with us<br>about our histories um<br>as a source of information but it's not<br>just that med says a tool for thinking<br>organizing information and systematizing<br>it considering the ethics of knowledge<br>the appropriateness of it all and<br>informing us about our world and our<br>place in it<br>so as a tonga subject to kaitlyakitanga<br>responsibility so as kaitiaki we have a<br>responsibility to make sure that<br>this<br>diagram here<br>is from a<br>a journal article that i co-wrote with a<br>couple of students who were in my maori<br>science class um<br>10 or 11 years ago now and<br>we were doing a bit of an exercise<br>around the information the data<br>information<br>knowledge wisdom pyramid<br>and seeing whether<br>that<br>frame<br>uh<br>was<br>was something that that could tell us<br>something more about<br>mata rang maori could tell us something<br>interesting about the construction of<br>knowledges on the western side of things<br>and this was<br>a bit of a think piece that anaru toya<br>did in relation to a particular fakatoki<br>that he'd chosen out of and this was<br>published in<br>the hiding mogul mead and neil grove um<br>so there's a couple of characters in in<br>this whakapoki uh paraffinua and<br>rakahore<br>parofenua being the atua personification<br>of water<br>and<br>the atua personification<br>one of those manifestations anyway<br>um<br>and um with with every uh i guess piece<br>of maori wisdom there's there's wisdom<br>there's there's knowledge information<br>and a layer and unpack that some more<br>there's there's data<br>much mature is very multi-layered and<br>there's some great as a physicist<br>there's some great hydrodynamics and<br>geology and hydrogeology going on in<br>this whakapoke as well without a rock<br>base water will not flow<br>so at face value this wakapokey appears<br>to be about the characteristics of atua<br>but reveals information and data about<br>so some years later<br>and that was sort of an interesting<br>connection that i found just a few<br>months ago that we'd been talking about<br>wakataki and mataranga of groundwater<br>well before this project<br>got set up by a gns science led by dr<br>catherine moore and funded by the<br>ministry for business of innovation and<br>employment through the endeavour fund<br>uh<br>the<br>the pathways and flows of the water<br>literally the descents<br>sort of gravity embedded in that word as<br>well<br>and in this project we've got sort of a<br>three-pronged<br>approach to<br>better understanding groundwater systems<br>aquifers and<br>recharge as well as<br>discharge of waters<br>from groundwater systems into streams<br>and springs<br>and so we've got new measurements being<br>made and different systems such as<br>isotopic aging data by<br>dr uvei morgenstern<br>we have numerical models that are<br>spatial as well as temporal models of<br>what's happening in the underground that<br>are pinned by<br>what data we have<br>that enable a constraining and honing of<br>of<br>the accuracy of those numerical models<br>and mato ranga is a key part of this<br>picture deepening the the data time<br>scale of our observations<br>as well as being a kind of a nesting<br>place for the work that we're doing on<br>this project<br>and<br>the the lions here of the work is being<br>led by dr amber arunui whose<br>so um in her mahi as an attica new<br>person she's<br>looking at mataranga oral histories<br>recorded and<br>and more recent oral histories related<br>to fresh water both above and<br>underground focusing on<br>um<br>a place near where she was brought up<br>pakipaki uh the padi tour stream at<br>bridge park which<br>which has gone dry in recent seasons<br>so uh<br>we've got some master students as well<br>three new masters students have joined<br>us this year doing uh individual<br>and some of the questions that are<br>arising from this project are<br>and these questions are relevant for<br>a number of other projects that that i<br>happen to be doing at the moment<br>how do we maintain the integrity of mata<br>ranga maori as a whole knowledge system<br>when we bring it into conversation into<br>interaction and collaboration with with<br>the sciences<br>um how do we achieve epistemic equity<br>how do we<br>uh<br>in practical terms when we're you know<br>sitting in front of our computers and<br>and we're bringing um<br>uh mataranga and all of the sort of<br>iterations of matauranga away from its<br>original source<br>into into a lab<br>how do we<br>is it possible to achieve a kind of<br>equitable<br>knowledge positions oops<br>i'll go backwards um<br>uh and how does matauranga maori remain<br>connected to its holders to its original<br>owners to hapu to maori tangata<br>and not just sort of be kind of<br>separated out or the the so-called data<br>part of it separated out as a data<br>source for<br>uh for incorporation or folding in or<br>mining um uh by western science so these<br>are tricky questions that we are<br>confronting on just about a daily basis<br>with all the different um<br>aspects of the the project<br>but uh one of the key<br>things that the the leader of this<br>project um kev moore talks about is is<br>that we want to with this project in a<br>sense use science as<br>hands for<br>uh supporting community concerns so she<br>talks about giving a numerical voice to<br>community concerns<br>and particularly in this case a round<br>way around its scarcity<br>and around its uh its quality or<br>i was asked recently by um a crowd<br>called monga bay what are my hopes for<br>the trajectory of mataranga<br>in aotearoa into the future<br>yeah i think it does need more support<br>to flourish we're just sort of<br>kind of holding on to what we have<br>um<br>and uh<br>yep so more support is needed and it<br>needs to be supported on its own terms<br>um<br>yeah uh<br>if what looks best for mataranga is not<br>business as usual<br>uh which i doubt that business as usual<br>is fit for the future for matarana then<br>we need to be open to some pretty pretty<br>radical changes around how we're<br>currently<br>dealing with matauranga and how we might<br>and not to<br>instrumentalize mataranga is something<br>that could help save our environment but<br>but there are<br>you know practical ways that mato<br>rangapan and science can support each<br>other to<br>do better by our environments and better<br>understanding<br>historic<br>historic states of environments<br>through to<br>couching our current<br>ways of knowing and ways of<br>looking at our<br>environments in<br>in mataranga and there's some really<br>amazing moves which we might get a<br>chance to talk about later i think of<br>the new environment<br>framework so um<br>yeah there's some there's some cool<br>stuff on the horizon so toitsu te<br>mataranga i'll finish on this um this<br>point i do have a<br>um<br>a good academic a list of references on<br>another slide but i won't i won't i'll<br>speed you there um<br>this is what we strive and aim for and<br>um<br>yeah and there are loads of challenges<br>in that but uh but now the different<br>work that we're doing i think we're<br>finding um practical ways that we can<br>uh<br>maintain those connections uh with<br>matauranga through practical<br>interaction with and use of it and um<br>yeah and i look forward to q a um<br>but um<br>at this stage i guess i'll pass over to<br>you spence and i don't know if you've<br>got any questions or<br>um should we just flow straight into<br>your court at all<br>um i i think um<br>we'll just flow straight in and then<br>possibly we can have<br>a good chance to get into questions at<br>um<br>um<br>in her opening comments<br>before academia<br>i was in<br>library and information positions for<br>for a number of years so i think<br>i counted it was probably something like<br>25 years<br>of um professional library experience<br>before becoming an academic<br>um<br>and<br>over that time<br>i<br>was involved in a number of different<br>positions um and<br>with my last position<br>being the maori services manager for the<br>messi university library system<br>so um over the time that i was in the<br>profession i sort of<br>was<br>very conscious of the range of different<br>resources that we had<br>in our library systems in archives<br>that contained mataranga maori or<br>focused on<br>maori in<br>lecture<br>a few weeks ago<br>we started out um<br>i'd sort of instructed<br>a couple of days previously by<br>the auction of this particular goldie<br>painting<br>that<br>the whanau<br>of this kalamata<br>were upset that they had not had<br>sufficient time to raise the funds to be<br>able to purchase this item themselves<br>and<br>they were concerned that this tonga<br>would be lost to their family forever<br>and<br>i guess i could sort of relate to that<br>because<br>the fact that it was going into a<br>private collection meant that<br>they may not be able to engage with that<br>it is a timer<br>but it's also a form of<br>martial maori<br>although it was painted by goldie who<br>was not maori himself<br>the representation of this komata<br>was<br>in its own way a story that could be<br>linked to many different events um<br>of this coma to his life and um his<br>predecessors and his ancestors<br>as well as those that have descended<br>from him<br>um he was well known as uh<br>one of um a group of chiefs that went to<br>england in the early 1860s and met with<br>queen victoria but there are many other<br>um stories and um<br>important information<br>and knowledge<br>that<br>is associated with him and um his<br>whanau hapu and evie<br>and i guess this is one of the things<br>that we see within um the collections<br>that we have in our institutions<br>basis<br>that<br>what you see is what you get to most<br>people they don't really understand<br>what has gone in to<br>the<br>development of these resources um<br>the personal the um<br>the civic the collective<br>and um the<br>the narratives that belong to these<br>particular tonga that represent martial<br>and maori in different ways<br>so um i thought that you know given<br>the whanau's<br>personal<br>um<br>relationship with this particular tala<br>is associated with it that i have a talk<br>about some items that i<br>have found<br>are represented in our institutions<br>that have a personal uh<br>relationship i have a personal<br>relationship with um and they represent<br>um not only tango but um aspects of<br>maori from our perspectives and it's<br>just representative of the types of um<br>this uh<br>sorry that i think the photo might be a<br>little bit blue<br>is<br>the anchor stone for<br>tokumaru<br>waka<br>and which is<br>in<br>the pokeyariki<br>museum in library<br>in new plymouth<br>it was<br>which is on the um<br>for those that know<br>the taranaki region is northern part of<br>taranaki heading towards um the waikato<br>um thai<br>um basin<br>so this is the anchor from tokumaru and<br>as you heard from my piping um<br>is my waka<br>so<br>this<br>anchor stone rested<br>um<br>until the 19<br>early<br>20th century<br>it was removed<br>put into safekeeping<br>and then<br>was<br>later donated to the taranaki museum for<br>safekeeping<br>in an article in the journal of the<br>stevenson percy smith<br>uh<br>wrote this particular article<br>about<br>um<br>the anchor stone and was based on<br>information that one of the surveyors<br>had provided to him<br>about the stone before it had gone<br>missing at this point they didn't know<br>where it was<br>so they they thought that they better<br>record the information that they had<br>about it<br>on the observation of um<br>skinner<br>so<br>as you can see it was<br>it's quite a big stone um<br>and uh<br>they believed that it weighed 336 pounds<br>i haven't conducted that into um<br>sort of<br>kilograms but i believe<br>quite a sizable um bigger than the prop<br>forward in any way for the audience<br>uh so this sketch is what they<br>had of it at that point they didn't have<br>the photo that um<br>was in the previous slide but um they<br>obviously put it up against this tree so<br>that you could sort of compare it to a<br>now 1927 it magically reappeared<br>and it was at this point that um it was<br>transferred<br>um to the taranaki museum<br>uh<br>what's also interesting from this photo<br>is um<br>the people that were present<br>the um<br>person in the front row um<br>clutching their ads<br>is<br>grasping<br>is supposed to be the ads<br>that helped<br>to me the personal connection comes<br>with<br>people that are in the back row<br>the first gentleman on the left is my<br>great grandfather<br>a woman standing next to him is my great<br>grandmother<br>the little girl<br>being held<br>it's my aunt<br>who was the oldest daughter of my<br>grandmother who is the woman that's<br>holding her<br>now um my<br>family<br>again and my people<br>behind you would have heard that i'm um<br>have affiliations to puki jungle<br>and ngati tafiti<br>both<br>which<br>strong hapu of the tiatiawa kiwi<br>the<br>and<br>his wife nixon is<br>muadi tahori the young girl is gertrude<br>broughton<br>but she chose to be known as josie<br>all her life she didn't want to be a<br>good troop<br>and<br>um also um known as lucy broughton<br>now um tomorrow for teddy um<br>it's a name that is also associated<br>cookie granny order<br>pochijangi yoda<br>is<br>a<br>past site that is up um the waikato road<br>it is<br>um<br>more<br>well known as a um<br>battlefield during the um musket walls<br>so sorry during the land wars<br>but for our heart it was a particularly<br>um important stronghold<br>during<br>um the musket wars in in the years<br>before that<br>um in 1821<br>um<br>pakistan from<br>being slaughtered by other<br>hatu of tiatiawa<br>and then ten years later<br>waikato tainui came down and besieged<br>kokirangi order par on the other side<br>trying to<br>to which all the tiati alba hapu had<br>um sort of come back to um<br>to<br>to protect themselves against the<br>invading waikato um tribes so um<br>it's an important<br>part<br>for that reason<br>um<br>that<br>when the siege was over<br>about twelve hundredths of of um<br>the teat<br>people that were in the park<br>jumped off the cliffs into that river<br>rather than be captured by waikato and a<br>lot of them then migrated down<br>to um<br>the kapiti area<br>and<br>some further on down into<br>the south island<br>the stories that are associated with<br>their power<br>are very important from the perspective<br>of the whole talanaki<br>history um<br>between the collective ewe<br>in that particular<br>region<br>plus the relationships with other eewi<br>and hapu<br>both in waikato tainui but also with<br>ngati toa nati<br>rokawa and then with<br>the other<br>tiati our were<br>groups that were at the tip of the south<br>island<br>and the other groups that are there was<br>in like rangitani<br>et cetera so<br>what i'm trying to sort of really get<br>across is that people see a picture<br>but<br>behind every picture that there is<br>knowledge that that is created with it<br>now<br>the connection that i have with this<br>particular place is that morelli fotati<br>was one of the paramount chiefs<br>of that particular place<br>and was<br>slaughtered<br>during that second siege in<br>1831-32 but there were descendants from<br>him and my great-grandfather that was in<br>that previous photo um would have been<br>the grandson of that particular<br>chief so it's it's showing those<br>the other um connection that i have is<br>um with a volcanic rock which is quite<br>prominent down the new from a port<br>region<br>known as paratutu now this rock was um<br>sort of the oldest<br>form of volcanic um<br>sort of activity um in that taranaki uh<br>region basis<br>but<br>to most people it's it's just a rock to<br>climb<br>um but to ngati tafiti that i'm also<br>affiliated to it was a<br>it was a place that<br>helped<br>provide<br>resources<br>it was a place of refuge<br>it was also a place where<br>you got a view so um that you could<br>understand who was approaching and who<br>wasn't<br>um off the um<br>off the coast of tarot tutu<br>you<br>also have what um james called the<br>sugarloaf islands which again had that<br>relation were part of that volcanic<br>formation but<br>were also places um<br>where seals and other marine life um<br>appeared and so<br>there's there's that whole history<br>around there about how ngati tafiti have<br>um occupied that particular place<br>for hundreds of years<br>and it's gone on<br>now pakiariki<br>um you'll<br>you will heard me mentioned<br>earlier that um<br>the library and information<br>and museum in new plymouth<br>is<br>named after papiya aleghi which was the<br>hill that<br>existed in that particular place until<br>deconstructed in the 19th century by the<br>in this particular photo which was taken<br>from marslin hill which was<br>another prominent<br>outlook in place in new plymouth you can<br>see that plukayaki<br>is that hill<br>in the<br>distance from<br>um there<br>now pokhariki of course means hill of<br>chiefs and that was um pretty much the<br>paramount par site in newcomers at that<br>time and it had been formed by um<br>ngati tafiti which wasn't named after<br>or wrong way the the prophet but<br>actually by his great great grandfather<br>um so<br>people<br>need to understand that the<br>relationships between different<br>generations of tafidio or ronald i think<br>he was third<br>um that the prophet was you know um<br>very much you know the said enlighten<br>of the fitties that um<br>unknown so<br>really the place that we<br>know<br>um and that al hapu have a very very<br>strong relationship to now is<br>appropriately<br>a library and a museum<br>which also holds a lot of our mataranga<br>and our tongue<br>and when you look at those tango you can<br>see<br>not only<br>what they were used for but the thought<br>and the um<br>the uh sort of<br>crafts<br>craftsmanship um if i can use<br>that particular term um and um also you<br>know sort of<br>the intellect and being able to<br>develop<br>these items that<br>help people<br>to adapt<br>to an environment and use it to the<br>um<br>most<br>um<br>sorry that's<br>um<br>one thing i i would say you know our our<br>institutions are filled with martial<br>language materials um and if<br>they are there<br>but not always<br>being used or understood to their full<br>potential<br>um<br>we have seen huge changes in technology<br>over the last 30 years particularly and<br>that has really made a lot more of this<br>material accessible<br>but<br>in saying that<br>when<br>searching for this<br>these<br>items<br>they're not always that discoverable and<br>in some ways that<br>means that people are not having the<br>opportunity to engage with items that<br>they may wish to access<br>but it's also<br>meaning that<br>the<br>material and and the history and the<br>narratives behind it aren't being<br>realized either<br>so<br>what we need to see with that<br>digitisation and um the cataloging and<br>making accessible through<br>resources like the internet<br>is a better form of intellectual access<br>and<br>this in a way is where libraries<br>are leading<br>through the<br>the maori subject headings which<br>as you can see<br>are hosted on the national libraries<br>website<br>some of the headings that are currently<br>being used these are these are the new<br>and changed terms and this comes back to<br>mata ranga maori here to stay because<br>what it's showing is that mataranga<br>maori is not a static<br>knowledge system<br>it is another system that is<br>developing all the time so you will see<br>here that new terms have been applied<br>that are<br>relative to the current sort of pandemic<br>issues that we've been working through<br>and<br>um as you can see they<br>they are sort of being given<br>um<br>terms that will also have meaning um<br>ongoing and um are sort of not<br>relying on the scientific or the um<br>english terms that have been used<br>so<br>i think i'll leave it there because i've<br>probably talked<br>much longer than i should do and perhaps<br>that was really fascinating and um what<br>is um<br>i'm going to have a a a that that looks<br>really amazing um<br>i'm not seeing any questions in the q a<br>at this stage um<br>so<br>maybe i can kick us off with a bit of a<br>question for us both to um<br>to mull over<br>in fact it's a question that uh<br>that you suggested um<br>we should dive into together was<br>what will matauranga maori look like in<br>the future<br>given how its transmission and access to<br>it has changed already so much in our<br>lifetime and maybe i'll invite you to<br>i<br>think that was lauren hardy's um<br>it it really you know<br>it it is very hard to predict the future<br>yeah<br>um i think<br>the way that<br>technology is evolving<br>maori<br>are becoming in using that technology<br>uh<br>it's it is very hard to understand<br>how<br>that will um<br>manifest itself in<br>in the next 50 years or so looking at<br>what has happened over my own lifetime<br>um you know<br>it's hard to pick what<br>is the most fantastic thing that's<br>happened over that lifetime um because<br>there's so much to choose from and so<br>it's very hard to know<br>you know for instance there's a lot of<br>work being done around artificial<br>intelligence at the moment and what is<br>and<br>you know it it opens up so many<br>possibilities um<br>particularly around how<br>information<br>and knowledge is stored<br>and disseminated but also sort of<br>providing<br>greater opportunities<br>for<br>knowledge to be<br>formatted in a way that it becomes<br>valuable and accessible to the people<br>that<br>perhaps have the greatest right to it<br>and that they can restrict<br>how it's um shared with others and it's<br>going back to some of those earlier<br>principles about you know sort of um<br>the protection of knowledge<br>um so yeah<br>and there's a lot going on in that space<br>and the protection of knowledge and i<br>think of the manararonga<br>crowd who are exploring maori data<br>sovereignty principles<br>and i'm just wondering spencer if<br>there's any um<br>the<br>the fair slash care data principles for<br>um<br>the care principles being about<br>indigenous data protection particularly<br>in<br>as<br>data is increasingly becoming more<br>available to us through the digital<br>realm<br>um is that uh something that um in your<br>field you're seeing<br>practical solutions being wrapped around<br>and making sure that you know provenance<br>is known and um and that some materials<br>are<br>could be considered sort of limited in<br>terms of their accesses<br>i think there's a greater awareness of<br>it<br>i think there's still a lot to be done<br>in terms of trying to sort of develop<br>systems that<br>enable<br>both access<br>and restriction<br>and<br>i guess that you know is<br>something that needs to be worked on<br>there's obviously<br>a movement<br>um<br>particularly in academia but also in the<br>wider<br>information professions<br>towards open access<br>and um<br>we have to understand some of the<br>ethical issues around<br>who makes the decision<br>as to what should be open to everyone<br>and what shouldn't be and i think joseph<br>um<br>obviously some people that become very<br>very enthusiastic about<br>open access<br>have to think that their<br>people from with<br>that have different value systems<br>may not sort of buy into their um<br>openness<br>in quite the same way and i think<br>there's still a lot of conversations to<br>be held around that um<br>yeah um<br>we've got some questions coming through<br>the q a so<br>uh let's return to some of those um<br>so is this the first one that's come<br>as a geophysicist can you talk more<br>about the incorporation of mata ranga<br>maori into your work<br>so my my training in physics a little<br>bit of geophysics um<br>uh is goes back you know sort of 20<br>years now so over the last 18 years or<br>so i've um i've been in<br>the school of maori studies<br>so<br>i guess one of the things that that<br>motivates a lot of my work um so not to<br>speak about anything in particular uh<br>because<br>i tend to be the sort of the<br>proposal writer and um<br>and paperwork person and the students<br>get to do all the fun stuff um and<br>there's a there's a tension there for me<br>so i asked amber for instance if it was<br>okay to share her photo and just a word<br>about her work<br>as i showed you before and she said that<br>was fine so but i do feel<br>that that work<br>in a sense it's coming from their hands<br>so it's their right to share it so um so<br>there are<br>uh i guess tensions around the ownership<br>of the work and the research that i do<br>in this space<br>just in that that particular<br>frame of<br>you know student and supervisor<br>um so<br>yeah but uh but one of the motivations<br>for for my work is is um seeking a kind<br>of a reconciliation between what i can<br>see is is two um<br>uh amazing uh knowledge systems uh and<br>and i think there's some really amazing<br>physics within mato ranga maori that<br>is sort of something something that i'd<br>like to do more of<br>but<br>amber and kath are really the people who<br>are working uh at the the sort of coal<br>face if we want to use that term these<br>things are talking geophysics<br>and finding ways to um<br>to to set<br>three<br>three systems of knowing a kind of an<br>empirical measurement system a modeling<br>system which is is forecasting and<br>hindcasting um and amatoranga maori<br>system and exploring how they can work<br>together and can support each other for<br>better more precise<br>understandings of what's happening<br>in our groundwater systems historically<br>and into the future<br>and we're working on a similar kind of<br>in a similar way um in the moana project<br>which is uh looking at oceanography um<br>and maori as oceanographers and<br>doing work in<br>forecasting marine heat waves<br>so um<br>that's sort of just an overview really<br>of the work as opposed to drilling down<br>into any specifics<br>um<br>we've got a question there that looks<br>like it's for spence<br>um so<br>question from nicholas short<br>one of your views about the impact of<br>tanga being taken from the fenway<br>eg being put into museums<br>um on the mountain running up or the<br>place fun i'm inhabited in the town<br>um<br>i think yet there's a number of<br>questions<br>there around<br>who has the right to take that material<br>and put it into museums a lot of<br>the items that end up in that situation<br>have been discovered<br>and have been donated to museums by<br>in individuals<br>typically that would not be seen as the<br>traditional owners of those items<br>um<br>i think possibly that it's good that<br>they have put them forward to them um<br>to the institutions<br>rather than hold on to them or destroy<br>them<br>but i think the question that really<br>comes into it then is<br>what is the responsibility of the<br>institution<br>to that material and who<br>are they accountable to for<br>for these items um<br>and sort of<br>the relationships between them<br>these<br>items belong to traditionally and who<br>should have the say over how they have<br>cared for in the future<br>whether they should be repatriated where<br>they whether they should be digitized<br>yeah so these are a lot of questions<br>around there and it really comes back to<br>those<br>distinguish between<br>um<br>the donors<br>and the owners<br>um and you know sort of and they're not<br>the same group of people um<br>always<br>so i think you know there are um a lot<br>of questions and<br>it's possible that you know this is um<br>in the<br>there have been a number of um tapu and<br>repositories or<br>sort of<br>cultural<br>knowledge senses that may<br>see that as being where these items<br>should end up<br>going back to<br>and i think you know those discussions<br>need to be<br>held um<br>you know people say that you can do<br>digital repatriation but<br>why should it be the<br>the rightful owners that get the digital<br>version<br>and not the original version<br>um<br>museums and libraries etc can<br>take a digital copy for their purposes<br>but basically but you know they could<br>send<br>um the original life and back<br>to<br>the owners<br>yeah it's<br>i think you you're<br>you're answering tracy maniaporto's<br>question there too i think with that um<br>whakautsu<br>spencer should tang and mata rona maori<br>be held within<br>cultural heritage institutions um and i<br>guess just<br>thinking about our people who are<br>working within cultural heritage<br>institutions they've<br>in a sense<br>strike me as being<br>kind of a surrogate kaitiaki they may<br>not be connected anywhere wise to the<br>directly to the taonga but they're there<br>and i just want to acknowledge the mahi<br>that they do<br>especially in the repatriation side of<br>things and amber ardanui who i've<br>mentioned before has been deeply<br>involved in<br>repatriation of human remains<br>um<br>which one should we go to next um let's<br>see there's a few<br>a question from gene fleming about<br>how pakiha can incorporate martin runger<br>more into the research<br>should this<br>be only through maori<br>i<br>believe that maori has to be strongly<br>involved<br>in that research um<br>not only as the<br>people being researched but as part of<br>team that is<br>undertaking that research and sort of<br>in a sense you know<br>working in partnership with those<br>that are not maori in the research team<br>to<br>be ensuring that the research that they<br>are doing<br>is within<br>the spirits of the kaupapa maori<br>research and ensure that<br>it's been done for the right reasons and<br>um the benefits are going to accrue<br>through to those that are being<br>researched<br>so i think it's really an alliance thing<br>if pakiha<br>or um<br>are going to be involved<br>yeah yeah you mentioned the term<br>alliance and<br>there's a huge role for pakeha allies<br>and decolonizing spaces so they are more<br>fit more welcoming for mata maori for<br>maori people in general<br>and there may be places where um<br>that allyship can<br>can reach into<br>questions of of<br>maori knowledge and maori histories<br>but yeah maori have to be the ones<br>making the calls the decisions and<br>guiding that mahi and<br>and also need to be resourced to do that<br>um<br>so<br>this is a this is a may for all of us to<br>work together on um but um<br>things will fit into place better if<br>if it's uh if it's maori leading these<br>corridors<br>um so sally's got a question up there<br>which maybe we'll be able to combine<br>with um<br>because it sort of flows on for the from<br>the geophysics question with something<br>further down<br>but will black asks how do you see<br>aligning data sovereignty to tertility<br>to combat genomic discrimination and<br>preserve data as a tonga<br>so genomic discrimination i i guess i<br>understand that<br>by the potential of i guess genomics to<br>um<br>to to be captured and to be used in ways<br>that are not ethical that are not<br>set and designed by communities for good<br>goods or communities but um have<br>capitalist goals in mind and profit<br>making is the kind of core uh thing<br>um<br>so<br>they that i think these are absolutely<br>part of the same conversation which is<br>about tenuring<br>is about<br>ultimate sovereignty over<br>um over our bodies over ourselves over<br>our mataranga our data data about us<br>it's been collected on us and that's the<br>the<br>yep so i see those things all lining up<br>and<br>being kind of answered by those core<br>principles of mana motuhake and<br>antinorangatiratanga<br>so what we need is is ways<br>systems practices institutions that can<br>support<br>maori sovereignty over over all of those<br>things including kind of body and<br>genetic sovereignty<br>um<br>how can we learn about mataranga maori<br>in a way that is less homogenized and<br>captures more we have specific thought<br>an entry point might be a kind of a<br>decolonizing one so you kind of clear<br>the space<br>for<br>a right engagement with um with mato<br>maori<br>will follow through connections with<br>people through supporting relationships<br>with um with with people um and<br>does their relationships with them<br>so<br>um so there'll be cases where you might<br>kind of go down one avenue or another<br>depending on<br>on<br>what what your particular<br>mahi is<br>yeah this is sort of we we've become a<br>little bit wary of the kind of ringa<br>komatua<br>and bring the komata into the school<br>kind of um mode because our komata and<br>kuya are just so drawn upon for so much<br>these days and um<br>and that's a that's a very precious and<br>scarce resource so we do need to be<br>quite careful about how we use those<br>scarce and precious resources um but but<br>there's definitely i think avenues for<br>both of those those things when we when<br>we're<br>when we're teaching it and the<br>curriculum is inviting us to look at our<br>histories or<br>not just inviting but um that's part of<br>curriculum now<br>and so that can be part of the sort of<br>decolonization conversation is<br>understanding uh colonial histories in<br>order to<br>to to move into a space that is um uh<br>able to uh uh more fully realize the<br>connectivity aspirations for for our<br>society<br>um i'm conscious of time with at 29 so<br>um<br>we've got a few questions left<br>uh<br>one for you spence on tokumaru yeah um<br>is the story about that particular um<br>waka and and stone sort of come back to<br>a narrative about mania who was the<br>um coyote of that particular walker and<br>the fact that they came down<br>the west coast of the north island they<br>tried to put ashore further up the west<br>coast and um we're sort of rebuffed by<br>um<br>called thai nui who were already there<br>so they came a bit further down and<br>came um<br>so there is a narrative that is there<br>but i'm conscious that that narrative<br>has really been shared<br>by people like percy smith and<br>others um<br>from around that time that perhaps some<br>of that knowledge has been embellished a<br>little bit<br>so there's probably a lot more work that<br>and there could be other knowledge that<br>i'm not aware of myself at the moment<br>that<br>is there available for people and it's<br>only really sort of getting into that<br>situation where you can talk to people<br>about these things that may have this<br>other forms of knowledge to go with this<br>that you can you can start making sense<br>of it so um<br>cool rebecca's um question there is the<br>most upvoted so maybe we can spend just<br>half a minute on that one the role of<br>archivists librarians curators is the<br>better and better of two better and<br>better mataram the way we currently work<br>any ideas on that one<br>i think it's really<br>understanding the environment that<br>you're working in and<br>the the value of the<br>resources that you are working with and<br>understanding the value of those to the<br>people that they traditionally<br>own uh uh owned by but also even you<br>know through<br>the use of photos like i've showed today<br>that you understand that there's more to<br>the photo um<br>what i'm finding myself in terms of<br>accessing these things is that there's<br>not a lot of information about<br>how they are related to particular<br>or evie whanau that they don't have you<br>know sort of um access points there so i<br>think<br>looking at what we're doing with<br>tokutoku and so looking at how we can<br>expand on those to sort of make that<br>matter<br>sort of more<br>evident than it currently is but it's<br>all about of<br>raising your consciousness about these<br>issues and<br>learning more and developing those<br>relationships i think is<br>is critical<br>killed it uh i think<br>the other thing too is te reo maori it's<br>just there's so much just embedded in uh<br>maori language materials and and the<br>real itself<br>um<br>so<br>uh folks who have joined us on the uh<br>the webinar yamaha<br>thank you for joining us thank you for<br>your questions and apologies we couldn't<br>answer all of them and the time that we<br>had really appreciate everyone being<br>so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
