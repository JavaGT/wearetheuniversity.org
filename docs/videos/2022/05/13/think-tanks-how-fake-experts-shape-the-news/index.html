Doing so is going to <br>involve touching-upon a number of deeply-important  <br>topics including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine <br>and the ongoing conservative moral panic  <br>about “Critical Race Theory”. But, I want to start <br>with a story that’s altogether much… stupider.<br>It was a little over a month ago now and I’d <br>just finished a long day of video editing  <br>when I wandered into my living room, <br>slumped down on the sofa and, more out  <br>of habit than any real enthusiasm, booted-up <br>the Twitter app on my phone. And, on doing so,  <br>I was met by a tweet sharing this incredible <br>headline: ‘The Moon should be privatised to  <br>help wipe out poverty on Earth, economists say’. <br>Just one more time in case you didn’t catch that:  <br>“The Moon should be privatised to help <br>wipe out poverty on Earth, economists say”.<br>The tweet was from the official account of The <br>Independent, a British newspaper which occupies a  <br>similar(ish) position in the editorial <br>spectrum of UK media as The Guardian,  <br>with the fun quirk of being partly owned by a <br>Russian oligarch and allegedly part-owned by the  <br>government of Saudi Arabia. The tweet linked <br>to an article which detailed the publication  <br>of a new research paper written by an economist <br>called Rebecca Lowe. The paper argues that,  <br>with commercial ventures such as SpaceX, Virgin <br>Galactic and Blue Origin gaining momentum  <br>(along with plenty of other, less <br>high-profile projects), the time  <br>has come to establish a system through which <br>individuals (and, by extension, corporations)  <br>can take ownership of portions of the Moon, and <br>use those patches of “Moon land” to turn a profit.<br>We’ll return to the report itself in a moment <br>but, back on Twitter, The Independent’s tweet  <br>promoting the article had gone what I’d describe <br>as very mildly viral. It wasn’t exactly Will  <br>Smith slapping Chris Rock or the Crazy Frog <br>or anything but, in the small neighbourhood  <br>of Twitter that my digital self calls home, <br>this was absolutely the post of the day.<br>The response was, to put it mildly,  <br>not positive. I scrolled for a long, long time <br>while writing this and the only responses to  <br>the tweet I could find that weren’t completely <br>savaging the idea of “privatising the Moon” were  <br>from the report’s author and someone who works <br>for the organisation that published the document,  <br>both of whom did their best to hide their <br>disappointment at having their proposal  <br>for renting the moon out to billionaires <br>roundly rejected in the marketplace of ideas.<br>In an interesting example of the weird <br>relationship between social media and  <br>the traditional news media in the present day, <br>this mild viral backlash meant that the report  <br>actually became a far bigger news story than it <br>had been previously. Prior to Twitter tearing  <br>into it, the only coverage the research paper <br>had received outside of that short write-up in  <br>The Independent had been from The Daily Star, a <br>tabloid which tends to publish articles of a much  <br>lower-brow variety. In the week following, <br>however, every newspaper in the country (and some  <br>from further afield) seemingly wanted to weigh-in <br>on the debate surrounding moon ownership. Articles  <br>were published in The National, The Guardian, Time <br>Out, the Tribune, the New Scientist, The Mary Sue.  <br>Even Ben Shapiro’s outlet The Daily Wire <br>tried to catch some clicks from the affair.<br>Like the responses to the tweet from The <br>Independent that had first caught my attention,  <br>the various follow-up articles almost exclusively <br>took a negative view of private Moon ownership.  <br>The overwhelming feeling was that humanity’s <br>baby steps into outer space provide us with the  <br>opportunity to rethink how we organise our economy <br>and that it’s a waste of that opportunity to let  <br>the same economic system which has destroyed <br>this planet add the Moon to its body count.<br>Okay, so why am I telling you this <br>story and what does any of this  <br>have to do with anything? Well, it would be <br>very easy to interpret what I’m calling the  <br>“privatising the Moon” affair as a sign of <br>a media ecosystem in the rudest of health;  <br>to frame this as an example of a journalist <br>engaging with cutting-edge research in order to  <br>facilitate healthy debate of a bold new economic <br>proposal. But, I want to suggest quite the  <br>opposite. Indeed, I would argue that the fact that <br>this debate about “privatising the Moon” was even  <br>had in the first place highlights a consistent <br>and habitual failure of contemporary journalism.<br>See, peppered throughout the tweets and newspaper <br>articles responding to the research paper which  <br>sparked this whole conversation was the occasional <br>bit of eye-rolling by more dedicated politics  <br>nerds at the organisation which had commissioned <br>the report. For, while that initial tweet from The  <br>Independent had credited the idea of privatising <br>the moon simply to “economists”, reading further  <br>revealed the paper not to have been published in <br>a peer-reviewed academic journal but, instead,  <br>simply as a pamphlet by an organisation <br>called the Adam Smith Institute.<br>Such a name might conjure-up images of <br>an elite academic institution staffed by  <br>respected professors; and that’s certainly <br>the goal. In truth, however, the Adam Smith  <br>Institute is little more than a propaganda outfit. <br>Deeply secretive about where its money comes from,  <br>the organisation’s sole reason for existing <br>is to churn-out dubious “papers” and  <br>“studies” which give academic-sounding support <br>to political policies which benefit large  <br>corporations and the super-rich. Following <br>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, for example,  <br>the Adam Smith Institute came out in opposition <br>to seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs,  <br>comparing the implementation of such sanctions <br>by NATO-aligned countries to European Jews  <br>being forced to sell their property as they <br>fled the holocaust. Really classy stuff…<br>The Adam Smith Institute is not alone in this line <br>of work. It’s one of many so-called “think tanks”  <br>which, over the past 50 years, have become <br>an inescapable feature of formal politics.  <br>You’ve probably heard of some of these <br>organisations: the Heritage Foundation,  <br>the Henry Jackson Society, the Institute of <br>Economic Affairs. Bridging the gap between  <br>lobbying groups, PR firms and universities, <br>think tanks exist across the political spectrum,  <br>but they’ve become a particularly <br>favoured tactic of the political right  <br>(who are both willing to be far more unscrupulous <br>in dressing-up pure propaganda as “research”  <br>and have far more money to spend in promoting <br>their ideas). Wealthy libertarians such as  <br>Charles Koch and Betsy DeVos pump money into <br>these faux-academic institutions as a means  <br>to launder political policies and ideas which <br>serve to reduce their tax bill and strip-away  <br>any regulation which might impact the <br>ability of their businesses to turn a profit.<br>As we’ll see throughout the rest of this <br>video, the impact that these organisations  <br>have on our politics is immense. There are <br>plenty of political policies in place today  <br>that would be unthinkable without these <br>fake research institutes having helped  <br>to falsely portray them as being grounded in <br>objective evidence. Some of the most familiar  <br>arguments in favour of conservative economic <br>and social policies, assumed by many people to  <br>merely be common sense, are also the result <br>of these organisations’ propaganda efforts.<br>It won’t surprise long-time viewers of my <br>channel, however, to learn that, in order  <br>to truly understand how think tanks operate in <br>the present day, I think we need to briefly look  <br>at where they came from. Because, it’s only <br>through doing so that one can begin to comprehend  <br>the deeply weird (yet highly influential) position <br>these fake experts occupy in our political system.<br>But, before we talk about that, I want to <br>suggest that, if you’re liking this video,  <br>you’ll also probably like a video I made last <br>year about how who owns the media affects  <br>what stories get reported on and how. And, if you <br>want the best experience for watching that video,  <br>then you’ll want to do so on Nebula. Nebula is the <br>Streamy Award-nominated streaming service created  <br>by a bunch of educational YouTubers and owned <br>by those creators themselves (including me!).<br>It allows you to watch my videos with zero <br>ads anywhere on the site, along with those  <br>of plenty of other creators you already know and <br>love. Once you’ve watched my video on media bias,  <br>for example, you’ll probably want to check-out <br>Second Thought’s videos on the topic and then  <br>you’ll likely want to watch Super Bunnyhop’s video <br>about Media Literacy and Game News which gives a  <br>really interesting, behind-the-scenes insight <br>into how news outlets decide what to report on.<br>If you’re interested in signing-up for Nebula,  <br>then you’ll want to know that the best way of <br>doing so is through a partnership that we’ve  <br>put together with another streaming <br>service called Curiosity Stream.  <br>This allows you to get access to both <br>platforms for less than $15 for an entire year.<br>Where Nebula is the home of all your favourite <br>indie-creators, Curiosity Stream is chock-full of  <br>big-budget documentaries and non-fiction films. <br>If you’re actually interested in the future of  <br>Moon settlement, for example, I really enjoyed <br>Return to the Moon, which provides a great insight  <br>into what it’ll take to build moon colonies and <br>how close to a reality that dream currently is.<br>Curiosity Stream and Nebula make for great <br>companions to one another and so we’ve partnered  <br>to put together a bundle deal in which signing up <br>to both services is actually cheaper than signing  <br>up to either service on its own. If you head to <br>curiositystream.com/tomnicholas, you can get 26%  <br>off the normal price of an annual Curiosity Stream <br>subscription, with Nebula thrown-in for free.<br>And, by using that link to let them know <br>that I sent you, you’ll also be helping  <br>to support my channel and enabling me to <br>continue to make videos like this one.<br>Which we will return to right now.<br>So, the story of the modern-day <br>think tank begins in America,  <br>in 1916, with this brilliantly bearded fellow:  <br>Robert S. Brookings. Brookings was very much <br>the Bill Gates or Michael Bloomberg of his day.  <br>He’d made his fortune manufacturing, transporting <br>and selling wooden furniture. And, he must’ve had  <br>a pretty good eye for dining room tables because, <br>by the age of 47, he’d become so unbelievably  <br>wealthy that he was able to pack-in his day job <br>entirely andfocus on the larger questions in life.  <br>Which… I mean… it’s not like a businessman getting <br>into politics has even been a bad idea, is it?<br>See, if you were a wealthy industrialist <br>in turn-of-the-century America,  <br>then you were all about the two “P”s: <br>philanthropy and progressivism. By philanthropy,  <br>I of course mean sharing a portion of your wealth <br>with honourable causes. This was the era of  <br>Carnegie and Rockefeller, both of whom loved to <br>dish out cash in return for the modest gesture  <br>of having their names chiselled in massive letters <br>on the side of a library or lecture theatre. By  <br>progressivism, I mean a new political philosophy <br>that was taking the American elite by storm.<br>Now, while related, it’s important to say that <br>the progressivism that gained traction at the  <br>beginning of the 20th century wasn’t quite <br>the same as what’s sometimes referred to as  <br>“progressivism” in American political <br>commentary today. These titans of industry  <br>weren’t about to call for a Bernie Sanders style <br>“political revolution”. Instead, for rich folks,  <br>turn-of-the-century progressivism was all <br>about taking a more “evidence-based” approach  <br>to politics. In an era of continuous <br>labour disputes, strikes and lock-outs,  <br>figures such as Robert S. Brookings felt <br>that politics had grown too ideological,  <br>and that society would benefit, instead, from a <br>more reasoned approach which found solutions to  <br>society’s ills in the then-blossoming field <br>of economics and other social sciences.<br>It was to this end that, in 1916, Brookings <br>founded the Institute for Government Research. His  <br>goal was for this organisation to hire a ragtag <br>bunch of economists and other social scientists  <br>to conduct studies and undertake research <br>which could then be shared with politicians  <br>(and those who vote for them) to help them make <br>more informed, rational decisions. Again, allergic  <br>to what he thought of as “ideological” thinking, <br>the Institute was to be, in Brookings’ own words,  <br>‘free from any political or pecuniary interests’ <br>and would simply ‘lay before the country in a  <br>coherent form the fundamental economic facts’ as <br>objectively as possible. And, if anyone’s worried  <br>that Brookings was being a little modest in his <br>founding of the Institute for Government Research,  <br>fear not, he renamed it the Brookings <br>Institution a few years later.<br>Of course, it’s important to acknowledge that this <br>notion of being able to “transcend ideology” and  <br>enact a perfectly “logical” politics is… a load <br>of rubbish. As Abigail Thorne of Philosophy Tube  <br>highlights in her video on Jordan Peterson, what <br>one considers to be “ideological” and what one  <br>views as just “logical” is itself informed by <br>one’s ideological view of the world; this is,  <br>in turn, often shaped by one’s material <br>interests. It speaks volumes, for instance,  <br>that the Brookings Institution was a committed <br>opponent of the New Deal, arguing instead that  <br>FDR should have responded to the Great Depression <br>with the implementation of austerity measures.<br>Nevertheless, there was clearly some degree of <br>intellectual freedom at the Brookings Institution.  <br>In 1933, for example, one Brookings researcher <br>wrote a paper which called for the nationalisation  <br>of the American coal industry, which is unlikely <br>to have been the natural political position  <br>of the Institution’s capitalist benefactor. <br>Brookings’ reputation for high-quality,  <br>independent research led to a small <br>coterie of similar organisations  <br>popping-up over the following decades. <br>The National Bureau for Economic Research  <br>and the Carnegie Endowment for <br>International Peace, for example,  <br>both similarly hired researchers to produce <br>reports on economic trends and defence policy.<br>In all honesty, these early think tanks were <br>pretty boring. They largely consisted of a  <br>bunch of policy nerds sitting in offices, <br>writing books and compiling studies that  <br>very few people actually read. Yet, <br>soon, all of that was to change.<br>See, as the 20th century wore on, the <br>brief trend among the super-rich for  <br>having a social conscience began to wane. <br>The economic elite in both America and Europe  <br>increasingly began to embrace <br>a politics of libertarianism  <br>or what’s now often called neoliberalism. These <br>political philosophies viewed state intervention  <br>in the economy—whether that be progressive <br>taxation, the provision of unemployment  <br>benefits or the requirement of workplaces to <br>comply with health and safety regulations—as  <br>denying rich people their fundamental human right <br>to get even richer. What they needed, however,  <br>was a way of making this clearly self-interested <br>worldview palatable to the general public.<br>A key figure in this campaign was a British <br>businessman called Antony Fisher. Fisher first  <br>became interested in neoliberal economics when he <br>read an abridged version of Friedrich Hayek’s The  <br>Road to Serfdom; which is essentially the sacred <br>text of people who like to shake their fists at  <br>“big government”. Fisher sought-out Hayek at a <br>public lecture at the London School of Economics  <br>and explained that the book had inspired <br>him to embark upon a career as a politician.  <br>Hayek, however, convinced Fisher that he <br>could have far more influence over politics  <br>by using his time (and wealth) to found a <br>“research institute” devoted to producing  <br>“evidence” to support the <br>implementation of right-wing policies.<br>There were a handful of pre-existing organisations <br>which Fisher was able to draw inspiration from  <br>when he founded the Institute of Economic <br>Affairs in 1955. Since the mid-1940s,  <br>concerned groups of businessmen in the <br>United States had begun to fund so-called  <br>“research organisations” which, on the surface, <br>seemed similar enough to the bureaucratic offering  <br>of the Brookings Institution. With names such <br>as the American Enterprise Institute and the  <br>Foundation for Economic Education, they certainly <br>sounded mundane enough. Yet, these organisations  <br>were driven by a far clearer political agenda. <br>Their role was no longer to undertake research  <br>which could inform recommendations for <br>political policy but to pick a conservative,  <br>libertarian or otherwise right-wing policy their <br>funders would want to see implemented and then  <br>work backwards to piece together some research <br>which showed that policy to be beneficial.<br>Fisher’s creation, the Institute of Economic <br>Affairs, was an overwhelming success.  <br>Over the course of 20 years, it waged a <br>quiet yet dedicated campaign to popularise  <br>free-market economic ideas <br>among British politicians  <br>and those who voted for them. These efforts <br>would pay-off in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher  <br>was elected as Prime Minister and began to <br>implement many of the IEA’s favoured policies.  <br>Fisher was not content with influencing British <br>politics, however. Spurred on by the victories  <br>of the IEA, he soon set about internationalising <br>this model of propaganda with an academic facade,  <br>founding the Manhattan Institute in America, the <br>Fraser Institute in Canada and the Centre for  <br>Independent Studies in Australia. In fact, all in <br>all, Fisher has been credited with contributing to  <br>the founding of 150 of these institutes across the <br>globe, all with the goal of providing advocates of  <br>unregulated capitalism with academic-sounding <br>evidence to support their arguments.<br>The most influential of what were slowly becoming <br>known as “think tanks” in the United States,  <br>however, was not one of Fisher’s. The <br>Heritage Foundation was founded in 1973  <br>with a donation of $250,000 from Joseph Coors, <br>then president of the Coors Brewing Company  <br>(a position we can only assume he obtained <br>through merit). If Antony Fisher established  <br>the model for the modern-day think tank, <br>then the Heritage Foundation perfected it.  <br>The Foundation did away with book-length <br>studies and original research almost entirely;  <br>instead focussing on the publication and <br>circulation of “policy briefs”. These consisted of  <br>super-short pamphlets containing “evidence” <br>to prove why a certain bill being considered  <br>by the US Congress was good or bad which would <br>be distributed to politicians and journalists  <br>to try and shape the political and <br>media conversation around that bill.<br>Much like the Institute of Economic Affairs <br>in the UK, the Heritage Foundation (and other  <br>right-wing think tanks like it) played <br>a key role in popularising libertarian  <br>and neoliberal ideas among the American public. <br>In doing so, they helped lay the groundwork for  <br>the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. As more <br>and more businesses and rich folks began to  <br>donate greater amounts of money to support their <br>work, the Heritage Foundation also began to put  <br>pressure on politicians themselves. When Reagan <br>first took office in 1981, Heritage presented his  <br>administration with a 3,000-page, 20-volume report <br>called Mandate for Leadership, which detailed all  <br>the policies they thought he should implement. <br>And… it worked. By the end of Reagan’s first term,  <br>he had enacted around half of the reforms <br>the Heritage Foundation had pushed for.<br>While the first think tanks were founded with <br>the intention of having at least a modicum of  <br>intellectual independence, then, during the <br>second half of the 20th century, they became  <br>increasingly partisan. Later organisations <br>such as the Institute of Economic Affairs  <br>and the Heritage Foundation were able to draw on <br>the relatively good reputation of firms such as  <br>the Brookings Institution to dress-up their <br>propaganda as legitimate, serious research.<br>One measure of the extent to which these <br>organisations have managed to infiltrate  <br>our politics is the sheer number of think tanks <br>that exist in the present day. Researcher Lynn  <br>Hellebust recalls that, in 1945, there were <br>just 62 think tanks in America. By the 1990s,  <br>she counted more than 1,200. Globally, a report <br>published by researchers at the University of  <br>Pennsylvania in 2021 estimated that there were <br>now 11,175 think tanks working to influence  <br>policy across the world. While this figure <br>includes some organisations which lean towards  <br>more legitimate research activity, right-wing <br>think tanks remain the most well-funded  <br>and thus the most influential. Many of these <br>exist under the umbrella of the Atlas Network, an  <br>international organisation funded by the personal <br>foundations of various right-wing billionaires  <br>including Charles Koch, which provides grants <br>and training to more than 500 think tanks  <br>which push for the adoption of libertarian <br>and neoliberal policies across the globe.<br>While we’ve already touched upon a few ways in <br>which think tanks manage to achieve this end,  <br>however, I want to continue by focussing more <br>explicitly on some of the tactics which these  <br>fake research institutes use to influence <br>which political policies get passed and which  <br>get ridiculed as “extreme” or “unworkable”. In <br>doing so, we’re going to take a look at a few  <br>concrete examples of think tanks shaping how <br>certain topics get talked about in the media  <br>as well as thinking about how all of this <br>might give us a slightly different perspective  <br>on that debate surrounding the <br>so-called privatisation of the Moon.<br>As we saw towards the end of the previous section, <br>one way in which think tanks work to influence  <br>what political policies get passed is through <br>directly engaging with politicians. This might  <br>include a whole range of activities from simply <br>sending them a briefing document which encourages  <br>them to support or oppose a certain bill, right up <br>to writing entire drafts of proposed legislation.<br>This has been something that has been <br>repeatedly evident during the process  <br>of the UK leaving the European Union. When, in <br>2018, it appeared that parliamentary deadlock  <br>might lead to the passing of a compromissory <br>deal in which the UK would continue to have some  <br>regulatory alignment with the EU on trade, the <br>Institute of Economic Affairs worked with more  <br>hardcore Brexiteers in Parliament to launch <br>their own proposed deal document called Plan  <br>A+ (2018). The writing of the IEA’s proposed deal <br>was supported by a grant from the Atlas Network  <br>and was, unsurprisingly, a libertarian’s <br>dream with provisions that would have  <br>essentially abolished the National Health <br>Service in favour of privatised healthcare.<br>In fact, the publication of this document ended <br>up causing some problems for the Institute.  <br>See, most think tanks in the UK and the US (and <br>likely elsewhere) are non-profits or charities.  <br>Legally, this means they have to retain some level <br>of plausible deniability about their political  <br>allegiances; they’re not propaganda outlets, <br>they’re just educators who just happen to always  <br>end up educating people that privatisation <br>and low taxes for billionaires are good.  <br>The Heritage Foundation in America, for <br>example, includes a disclaimer at the  <br>bottom of all their policy reports which states <br>that ‘nothing written here is to be construed as  <br>necessarily reflecting the views of The Heritage <br>Foundation or as an attempt to aid or hinder  <br>the passage of any bill before Congress’. <br>Which is particularly funny when it’s printed  <br>on the bottom of reports called things <br>like Is Social Security Worth Its Cost?.<br>So obvious were the Institute of Economic Affairs’ <br>attempts to influence the Brexit process, however,  <br>that it ended up being issued with a formal <br>warning by the UK Charity Commission; a warning  <br>the Commission then withdrew when it was pointed <br>out that, if it was going to criticise the IEA  <br>for undertaking political activities then <br>it would probably have to also criticise  <br>every other think tank and… I guess that was <br>a can of worms it was just easier not to open.<br>All of this, however, is a far cry from the <br>debate about Moon privatisation that I discussed  <br>at the beginning of this video. For, while the <br>publication of the paper that started that debate  <br>probably didn’t go nearly as well as <br>the Adam Smith Institute had hoped,  <br>it’s unlikely that they ever thought it was <br>going to lead to the immediate adoption by the  <br>UK Government of policies which would allow Elon <br>Musk to become custodian of the Moon. Instead,  <br>the release of that paper was part of the other <br>side to the work of think tanks: influencing the  <br>ways in which we talk about politics through <br>the sustained manipulation of the media.<br>One way in which think tanks achieve this is by <br>intervening in already-ongoing political debates  <br>through arranging media appearances <br>for their so-called researchers.  <br>Whenever a proposed political policy is being <br>discussed on the news, think tanks will work  <br>hard to ensure that a member of their staff is <br>present to put across the views of their employer.<br>Take this recent clip from the BBC News <br>Channel in which the topic being discussed  <br>was the UK Government’s plans to forcibly <br>migrate asylum seekers to Rwanda. This is  <br>an initiative that has been widely condemned <br>as inhumane and cruel by human rights groups.  <br>Nevertheless, in their reporting on the topic, the <br>BBC chose to bring on a guy called Sam Armstrong,  <br>who works for a think tank called the Henry <br>Jackson Society. To the average viewer,  <br>the Henry Jackson Society likely sounds <br>like a legitimate research institution.  <br>By extension, most people will assume Armstrong to <br>be a qualified expert on the topic of immigration.<br>In reality, the Henry Jackson Society is <br>an organisation which essentially exists to  <br>promote Islamophobia in British society. Its most <br>famous alumnus is Douglas Murray, whose book The  <br>Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity and <br>Islam (2017) was described by The Guardian as ‘an  <br>attenuated version of the great replacement <br>theory for the Telegraph-reading classes’.  <br>Like the Adam Smith Institute, the Henry Jackson <br>Society is deeply secretive about who funds it,  <br>yet researchers at the University of <br>Bath have identified as one of its  <br>largest donors Stanley Kalms, a former <br>businessman and Conservative Party activist  <br>who later switched his allegiance to Nigel <br>Farage’s far-right UK Independence Party. In 2020,  <br>it was also revealed that the Henry <br>Jackson Society had received £80,000  <br>from the Home Office itself (that’s the body <br>which is in charge of UK immigration policy).<br>Far from an independent expert, then, Armstrong <br>(himself a former Conservative Party activist)  <br>is little more than a propagandist. Given <br>that the organisation that pays his salary  <br>has received funding from the very same <br>government body that is responsible for  <br>conceiving of the policy he was invited onto <br>the BBC to discuss, it’s little surprise that  <br>he chose to argue that the forced migration of <br>vulnerable people is a great thing, actually.<br>Figures from think tanks are constantly <br>called-upon to contribute quotes to articles  <br>or appear on the news, with little time or space <br>given to the matter of who funds their operations.  <br>This is partly the result of naivety on the part <br>of journalists, but it’s largely down to how  <br>sophisticated think tanks are at playing the media <br>game. See, if you’re a television producer trying  <br>to book guests, identifying actual experts and <br>persuading them to come on your show is difficult  <br>and time consuming; most university professors, <br>for example, don’t have full-time publicists.  <br>Contrast this with the Adam Smith Institute, which <br>has a mobile number on the bottom of its website  <br>which it encourages journalists and <br>producers to contact 24 hours-a-day.  <br>If you need a guest quickly, it’s clear <br>who you’re going to get in touch with.<br>In their efforts to manipulate our political <br>discourse, however, most think tanks are far  <br>more ambitious than simply wanting to respond to <br>whatever the topic of the day is. As we saw in the  <br>case of the Heritage Foundation in the previous <br>section, most of these fake research institutes  <br>are willing to undertake far longer-term work <br>to change public attitudes about certain issues.<br>One good example of this relates to the welfare <br>state, government benefits and social security  <br>payments. If you’ve ever got into an argument with <br>someone about whether the government should give  <br>money to people who are low-paid, unemployed <br>or unable to work, then they might’ve raised  <br>the concept of “welfare dependency” which, as <br>the UK-based Centre for Policy Studies puts it,  <br>‘is an economically destructive phenomenon which <br>[...] reduces the incentive to work and earn more  <br>whilst keeping people trapped in a cycle of <br>low aspirations, low productivity and low pay’.  <br>The argument is essentially that, if you’re too <br>generous with state benefits, people will become  <br>over-reliant on that money to the point where <br>it kills off their drive to ever find work.<br>The idea of “welfare dependency” is so <br>widespread in debates surrounding social security  <br>that one would assume that it stems from some <br>highly-revered study. But, that’s not the case.  <br>In fact, the idea that one can become <br>“dependent” on state welfare was first  <br>blasted into the mainstream <br>by this guy: Charles Murray.<br>Now, if you’ve heard of Charles Murray, it’s <br>probably for his co-authorship of the 1994 book  <br>The Bell Curve, which famously suggests that <br>differential outcomes between black and white  <br>Americans are not the result of structural <br>racism but, instead, of genetically-determined  <br>differences in intelligence between those two <br>groups. What you might not know is that Murray is  <br>a think tank guy through-and-through. He currently <br>works for the American Enterprise Institute,  <br>but spent much of his career at the <br>billionaire-funded Manhattan Institute.<br>It was the Manhattan Institute that <br>funded the writing of Murray’s first book,  <br>Losing Ground (1984), which argued that the <br>advent of welfare programmes for the poor  <br>had ‘made it profitable for the <br>poor to behave in the short term  <br>in ways that were destructive in the long <br>term’. Murray concluded that the only way  <br>to combat what he saw as a growing dependency <br>among poor people on “hand-outs” from the state  <br>was to scrap ‘the entire federal welfare and <br>income-support structure for working-aged persons,  <br>including [Aid to Families with Dependent <br>Children], Medicaid, Food Stamps, Unemployment  <br>Insurance, Workers’ Compensation, subsidised <br>housing, disability insurance and the rest’.<br>Despite Losing Ground being panned by academic <br>sociologists and economists who criticised it as a  <br>shoddy, politically-motivated piece <br>of research, the media-savvy Manhattan  <br>Institute was able to use the book as the <br>basis for starting a debate in the media  <br>about the efficacy of social security programmes. <br>Armed with this concept of “welfare dependency”,  <br>it was suddenly possible for <br>those arguing for the complete  <br>abolition of government support for society’s most <br>vulnerable to portray themselves as benevolent  <br>saviours who simply wanted to defend the <br>poor from being coddled by the state.<br>In fact, the end result of the reframing of the <br>welfare state which Murray began is not to be  <br>found, as one might assume, in the cuts to social <br>security programmes enacted by Ronald Reagan.  <br>Reagan was quite happy to demonise the poor <br>with tropes such as that of the “welfare queen”.  <br>Where we really see the impact of Losing <br>Ground is in the reforms of Bill Clinton  <br>10 years later. For, so normalised had <br>this view of the welfare state as a  <br>hindrance rather than a help to <br>those who received it become,  <br>that Clinton was able to declare that he was <br>going to ‘end welfare as we know it’ with pride,  <br>and position his cutting of financial support to <br>poor, unemployed mothers as a compassionate act.<br>The real power of think tanks, then, and the <br>reason that the super-rich and large corporations  <br>divert significant sums of money to <br>funding them, is their ability to,  <br>through sustained effort over whole decades, <br>change the terms of political debate.  <br>Through pumping-out questionable <br>research, think tanks are able to make the  <br>self-interested policy demands of the elite <br>appear to be grounded in evidence. And they  <br>are able to use their skill at manipulating the <br>media to push those ideas on the general public.  <br>Through this process, actions which at one <br>point might have been seen as shocking—such  <br>as a society refusing to provide assistance to its <br>poorest members—come to be seen as common sense.<br>All of which brings us back <br>to the Adam Smith Institute  <br>and their proposal to give <br>billionaires dominion over the Moon.<br>I think there’s a bunch of potential <br>explanations for what the Adam Smith  <br>Institute’s intentions were in trying to <br>promote this idea that we urgently need to  <br>establish a system of private property rights <br>on the Moon. Judging by how much of the paper  <br>is spent not actually discussing the moon at <br>all but, instead, introducing the reader to  <br>John Locke’s moral justification for the <br>establishment of private property rights,  <br>it’s possibly just a bait-and-switch <br>in which the Institute is using the  <br>“sexy” topic of commercial space activity as <br>an excuse to talk about how great the private  <br>ownership of natural resources is. Or, maybe this <br>is the beginning of a prolonged campaign to try  <br>and get the voting public on-side with the idea <br>of Jeff Bezos building a golf course on the moon.<br>Unsurprisingly given who published it, <br>if you go away and read the paper itself,  <br>you’ll most likely be massively underwhelmed. <br>It’s more of an extended think-piece than a  <br>rigorous examination of space law and the author, <br>Rebecca Lowe, is forced to admit within it that  <br>her proposals are completely unworkable in <br>the absence of an internationally-recognised  <br>model for setting and enforcing laws in <br>outer space. It certainly seems unlikely  <br>that this research would be deemed diligent <br>enough to withstand a peer review process.<br>As I mentioned earlier, it’s safe to say that the <br>launch of this paper probably didn’t go quite the  <br>way the Adam Smith Institute had hoped. In fact, <br>with all the hatred the idea attracted, we could  <br>say it went about as well as a SpaceX rocket <br>launch. And yet, despite the mediocrity of the  <br>research paper itself and the organisation which <br>was publishing it having an established history  <br>of releasing shoddy work that solely serves the <br>interests of its corporate funders, it still made  <br>headlines. At a time when energy bills, rents <br>and inflation were on the rise, it led to many  <br>hours of human thought and labour being wasted <br>on a conversation about something as remote to  <br>most of our lives as Moon law. Which goes to show <br>that, even when things don’t go exactly to plan,  <br>think tanks retain an ability to set the terms of <br>our political debate; to use their considerable  <br>resources to shape the news, forcing everyone <br>else into a position where they can only respond.<br>In fact, while I was researching this video, <br>I gradually realised that another news event  <br>of the past 18 months is entirely the work <br>of right-wing think tanks. The present moral  <br>panic amongst American conservatives surrounding <br>“Critical Race Theory” can entirely be laid at  <br>the feet of a network of such organisations in the <br>United States who have not only worked to promote  <br>this confected outrage but, in their nurturing <br>of the man who has been its biggest proponent,  <br>Christopher F. Rufo, were essential to giving <br>it a degree of credibility in the first place.<br>I was going to include a discussion of <br>“Critical Race Theory” in this video,  <br>but the resulting script ended-up sounding <br>a bit like two videos had had a car crash.  <br>So, if you’d like to see a sequel to this video, <br>then let me know. Otherwise, next time you’re  <br>reading the newspaper or watching the news, take a <br>closer look at who’s being quoted or interviewed,  <br>because, whilst expertise can be something to be <br>celebrated, not all “experts” are created equal.<br>Thank you so much for watching this video, <br>I hope it’s been worthy of your time!  <br>If you have any friends (either online or off) <br>who you think also might be interested in it,  <br>then I’d be super grateful if you’d consider <br>sharing it with them.
