font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hello everyone and welcome to the 2022<br>gibbons lecture series my name is jr and<br>i'm the deputy dean and the faculty of<br>science and it's my absolute privilege<br>to be here welcoming you and everyone<br>who's tuning in<br>in a virtual sense to the gibbons<br>lecture series from 2022<br>this lecture series of course is in<br>honor of peter gibbons and i'd like to<br>extend a very warm welcome to members of<br>the gibbons family and their friends who<br>are joining us tonight<br>peter was a member of the university of<br>auckland's department of computer<br>science from its earliest days in 1980<br>until his retirement in 2004 and that<br>just brackets the time when i started<br>doing computer science at the university<br>of auckland i only did it at 100 level<br>but i have the suspicion that peter<br>taught me<br>he was the first external hire into the<br>fledgling department and he was a<br>central figure in the department's<br>development and i think uh one of the<br>things about peter when i was reading up<br>on his um his virtues really was the<br>fact that he was very quick to pick up<br>on the collaborative potential of the<br>internet and i think that he would have<br>been really delighted to<br>be here tonight for this year's theme<br>which is above and beyond cloud<br>computing<br>and cloud computing of course offers an<br>alternative to companies maintaining<br>their own infrastructure provides<br>elasticity<br>of resources along with promises around<br>carbon dioxide<br>emission reduction i'm really interested<br>in hearing more about that<br>and this year we have in this series we<br>have two talks and two panel sessions<br>and they're going to run every wednesday<br>for four weeks so i welcome you along to<br>the first one and i hope you join us for<br>the subsequent ones<br>and i have to note that the series<br>wouldn't be possible without the<br>sponsorship of people like the it<br>professionals of new zealand the school<br>of computer science the auckland ict<br>graduate school the strong ai lab and<br>the gibbons lecture fund so thank you<br>very much if you've popped<br>some dosh into the pot to enable this<br>it's really appreciated<br>and tonight we welcome associate<br>professor david is from the university<br>of otago who will describe the key<br>technical advances that enabled the<br>spectacular rise of cloud computing and<br>how cloud technology looks set to evolve<br>and i'm super interested in that because<br>i'm a geologist and i work in geological<br>time and i was just having a chat to<br>david and marveling at the punctuated<br>equilibrium<br>that i would describe<br>as uh this incredible development of<br>cloud<br>computing david completed his phd in<br>post-doctoral research in the department<br>of computer science and technology at<br>the university of cambridge and<br>apparently it was just down the corridor<br>but listening very carefully to the<br>folks that were really coming on board<br>with the whole notion of cloud computing<br>and i know that david's got a lot of<br>really excellent stories to tell and i'm<br>really looking forward to his talk<br>tonight so<br>this area to be streamed properly so the<br>audience participation you're welcome to<br>direct me back into the center if i<br>appear to have drifted to one side<br>so<br>first of all i should say tenacious<br>i am honored to be here to open this<br>series having watched the series in the<br>past it's an absolute delight to be able<br>to try to contribute to it myself<br>cloud computing it's been quite a ride<br>everything as a service is what the<br>cloud tries to offer and is thus the<br>title of the talk that i'm giving<br>tonight<br>it opens up this uh lecture series which<br>is talking above and beyond cloud<br>computing<br>so without further ado let's get into<br>some of the material<br>my plan okay what's my cloudy background<br>and what's the plan for what i want to<br>do tonight<br>it goes as follows first of all i would<br>really like to explain some of the key<br>technical advances that built the cloud<br>i'd like you to take away an<br>understanding of some of the really cool<br>technology that sits there enabling<br>cloud i'm also very happy to talk more<br>about it afterwards<br>i'm keen that i can highlight some of<br>the challenges that are beginning to<br>face cloud computing because of course<br>now the cloud is becoming so dominant<br>you end up opening up interesting<br>challenges that come with that paradigm<br>shift in how we do computing<br>i'm also keen to suggest some of the<br>directions in which we're going to get<br>some future cloud trajectories but i<br>would of course also draw your attention<br>to the other lectures in this series and<br>particularly there's a lecture that's<br>going to talk entirely about new zealand<br>and the cloud and the way that's going<br>to work that's one of the panel<br>discussions that's coming up in a few<br>weeks time<br>the suitability for the plan why am i<br>here<br>for a start i've had a research interest<br>in cloud particularly because i came<br>from a security background and found<br>that there were interesting topics to<br>examine within cloud security but<br>secondly as has been mentioned i was<br>kind of just down the corridor from<br>where some of the really key cloud<br>technologies actually ended up starting<br>in terms of my involvement with the rise<br>and flourishing of cloud computing i was<br>looking the other way so i didn't really<br>ride that particular ascendancy into<br>greatness of computing paradigm but i<br>did end up having the honor of being<br>able to talk to a number of the people<br>that were key in that development and i<br>got to hear about at least some of the<br>interesting problems that they were<br>facing in terms of what they needed to<br>do to make these technologies work<br>that's the wrong button sorry how do you<br>start this you press that<br>there we go<br>that's the correct button<br>2001 cast your mind back to that time<br>i've characterized this as being a time<br>when well e-commerce was a term that<br>people used as opposed to all commerce<br>just being e-commerce<br>but it was a time where you had<br>organizations embracing information<br>technology and by doing so the client<br>server model where you had client<br>computers connecting to these server<br>computers that were in machine rooms<br>were causing machine rooms to steadily<br>fill up<br>even in the residential college<br>environment i was in at the time you got<br>this situation where you might want to<br>do something like acquire a customer<br>relationship management software package<br>but the people that gave you that<br>particular infrastructure the server<br>that sat in your machine room that was<br>the customer relationship management<br>system<br>they didn't really want it sharing its<br>database with the other server that you<br>had there was also a database server<br>that was doing the database so the door<br>access control system<br>they wanted to make sure that they could<br>keep these things isolated and<br>manageable you know if they had to come<br>in and fix stuff they didn't want all<br>this noise and pollution of other<br>concerns mixed into their computing<br>environment so what that ended up<br>meaning was that as you wanted to<br>isolate different software products you<br>ended up buying more hardware<br>but this was a particular problem<br>because the hardware often ended up<br>highly under utilized<br>so we had situations where you look at<br>what was happening on the computers we<br>had in the machine room a lot of the<br>computers would just be sitting at like<br>10 of their use so their peak capacity<br>of what they could do in terms of number<br>crunching they were nowhere near the<br>customer relationship management system<br>had been specified to handle whatever<br>spikes in load on customer relationship<br>management systems look like maybe<br>alumni drives or something like that<br>most of the time you weren't running an<br>alumni drive even if the development<br>office probably wanted to and it meant<br>that server was sitting there close to<br>idle now what's the problem with that<br>the problem with that is that<br>when those computers of the day were<br>sitting close to idle if they weren't<br>doing any useful data crunching they're<br>still using a lot of electricity and<br>i've kind of approximated the<br>numbers-ish these are not completely<br>precise because of course you'd have to<br>say what type of server was i talking<br>about i've tried to rewind the clock<br>back to the day and give you a bit of a<br>sketch of what machines might have been<br>like at that time power wise the base<br>load of your typical server machines was<br>about 200 watts that means if it was on<br>and doing nothing it was going to be<br>drawing about 200 watts of of power<br>if you ramped up the cpu to be 100 so it<br>was busy as it could possibly be which<br>typically you don't do anyway because it<br>typically means things start getting a<br>little bit unstable and a bit risky in<br>terms of the software kind of actually<br>working properly<br>even if you did that you might only be<br>adding an extra 100 watts worth of load<br>so you can see that if you start<br>multiplying the number of computers that<br>you have in your machine room this is<br>really not good you're wasting a lot of<br>resources<br>but moreover you're just wasting a lot<br>of equipment anyway because all of those<br>servers could do more work they're just<br>not really being given a useful kind of<br>job to do so that was the situation that<br>we were kind of facing<br>we then moved forward to<br>where i happened to be at the time i had<br>the the privilege of being doing my phd<br>at the university of cambridge<br>the very time that i arrived i ended up<br>at a dinner<br>where they were welcoming new people<br>into the phd program i was feeling<br>rather nervous about i ended up being<br>sat next to a fellow by the name of ian<br>pratt who<br>talks more than i do that was a<br>refreshing change to begin with but the<br>other thing which is wonderful about ian<br>was he was clearly brilliant but he was<br>extremely inclusive so he talked the<br>whole night to me about everything that<br>he'd been doing in that research base<br>and the thing which i took away was i<br>felt that it was actually achievable i<br>mean i couldn't do it without a huge<br>amount of work but you know you could<br>join ian and with him you could actually<br>get these remarkable things done he was<br>so inclusive it was a really really<br>positive experience<br>i have no idea<br>i'm not sure if i'm doing that i'm just<br>gonna maybe i'm walking too close to<br>that side so i'm gonna go back into the<br>middle and hope that it stays still<br>to quote from one of the papers that was<br>published from ian's group because ian<br>was heading the systems research group<br>at the university of cambridge computer<br>laboratory as it was called at the time<br>they'd been working on this theme of<br>resource control inside operating<br>systems and one of the things which they<br>were doing was building pretty solid<br>prototypes so they weren't kind of<br>making vaporware that kind of begins to<br>bit rot the instant that you take the<br>funding away or the student leaves they<br>were trying to build these quite solid<br>systems to prove their ideas what that<br>meant was all their phd students were<br>running over by about like one and a<br>half times because they spent so much<br>time writing code so it's not<br>necessarily all good for everyone but it<br>did mean they had some very solid things<br>to base their work on<br>the vision really was interesting when<br>you look now at what the cloud is from<br>their hot ass which is at one of the<br>conferences 1999<br>paper if you don't mind me reading that<br>quote they say we propose a system that<br>can execute codes supplied by an<br>untrusted user yet can charge this user<br>for all the resources that they consume<br>by the computation<br>so this was the xeno server vision as it<br>was seen by uh by ian this idea that you<br>could<br>safely run untrusted code but you could<br>account for that code's use uh but you<br>needed some way to actually make this<br>work because essentially you're running<br>uh<br>anything like the operating system that<br>you're running from these these users<br>could be any particular piece of<br>software so you need something which can<br>kind of allow you to do that safely the<br>typical way you do this and this is the<br>sort of first key cloud technology is<br>this notion of virtualization you want<br>to virtualize the untrusted operating<br>system<br>to make it become something which you<br>can manage for this kind of resource<br>accounting and<br>isolation in terms of security<br>so this is the first key technology what<br>you want to do is take the physical<br>and the figure on the right hand side<br>begins by showing two physical servers<br>that might have sat in the machine room<br>they're sitting on i don't know why the<br>hardware is purple i'm slightly<br>colorblind so i kind of just like<br>use that as my kind of get out card for<br>all color choices the hardware's purple<br>you've got two computers sitting next to<br>each other with their stacks where the<br>hardware is sitting underneath the<br>operating system could be linux could be<br>windows on those two different computers<br>and then you've got stuff running over<br>the top these are server applications a<br>web server something like that running<br>over the top what you want to do is take<br>that physical infrastructure with those<br>two different physical computers and you<br>want to virtualize them that's where you<br>take the two different uh concerns the<br>two operating systems which could have<br>as i said been 1b linux one being<br>windows and you want to run them over<br>the same hardware you're consolidating<br>those different operating systems from<br>those different physical servers to run<br>over one physical server<br>so the idea is that you can then run<br>this untrusted code that is being<br>presented to the xeno servers and you<br>can run it in these virtual machines<br>that are highlighted by the grey boxes<br>there i do understand the color gray<br>how do you make this work for security<br>purposes you need to slip in this layer<br>of protection and that layer of<br>protection is called a hypervisor it's<br>not the only thing it's called but i'll<br>call it a hypervisor and i'm happy to<br>talk about other definitions later<br>you slip that above the hardware and<br>underneath the virtual machines and it<br>can switch the resources of the physical<br>computer so that you can then have all<br>these different virtual machines run<br>over the top<br>but one of the interesting things to me<br>here is that virtualization itself is<br>not a new idea it's actually been around<br>for a long time ibm was doing this in<br>the 1960s as a general rule that i tell<br>my students if you want to look for the<br>next big thing that's going to happen in<br>computing go back 30 years and look at<br>what ibm was doing and then give it a<br>new name and that's possibly a way of<br>discovering the next big thing in<br>computing<br>the environment changes slightly to mean<br>that you've got a new accessibility of<br>possibilities because our parts of the<br>environment is different<br>but so you've had since the 1960s ibm<br>being able to do this work you had<br>vmware as a company that was doing<br>innovative work on pc hardware even in<br>sort of 1999<br>but the problem was these workloads<br>weren't quite right first of all the<br>vmware workload wasn't really quite<br>trying to do the security isolation it<br>was more allowing you to be able to kind<br>of do tech support freeze and<br>freeze and restore the state of virtual<br>machines if you needed to like test the<br>software product on windows 95 and<br>windows 98 and windows millennium<br>edition whatever that was windows xp you<br>all these different systems you might<br>want to test your software on rather<br>than having to have physical computers<br>of all those different types you could<br>use vmware to more conveniently run<br>virtual machines on one platform but<br>we'll see on the next slide<br>why that wasn't quite good enough for<br>what we needed for zeno servers the<br>price tags though that was a problem for<br>research because the price tags were<br>quite large these technologies didn't<br>come cheaply<br>so what did the research group in<br>cambridge decide to do they decided they<br>were going to build their own<br>and it turns out that they were in a<br>very lucky position that had a whole<br>series of phds that contributed useful<br>components that actually sat together so<br>they were complementary in a really true<br>sense so the sum was really a massive<br>amount greater than the sum of its<br>individual parts the paper that i'm<br>showing here on the right-hand side was<br>the seminal work that came from their<br>stuff zen and the art of virtualization<br>and what's key here is that the paper<br>title doesn't suggest that they invented<br>virtualization but more that they<br>fine-tuned it how will we'll have a look<br>so cambridge's system was called zen and<br>really i think was one of the key things<br>that kicked off the development of cloud<br>computing<br>the point i'll talk about is the<br>performance comparison so i've drawn out<br>one particular figure from the paper<br>from 2003 now what this shows with these<br>collections of bars is a whole series of<br>different experiments the thing on the<br>left hand side is not very interesting<br>because it's always at 1.0 it's<br>normalized it's linux just running<br>unmodified so that's a physical computer<br>with no virtualization doing whatever<br>the workload is the right hand side the<br>right most bars in each of those sets<br>the light gray color is user mode linux<br>which was expected to be slow even<br>though it's a handy thing to have around<br>the third column across and apologies<br>for the non-linear order here but<br>hopefully we're all okay with that the<br>not totally light gray but slightly less<br>light gray bars that are third from the<br>left or second from the right in each<br>one of those that is vmware and the<br>other one which i haven't explained the<br>second from the left is zen<br>what you see is the performance<br>comparison here showed that vmware<br>workstation which was an expensive<br>closed source commercial piece of<br>software<br>you have in the point that i've<br>highlighted by this arrow an impact on<br>that particular test that i've i've<br>highlighted with those arrows what that<br>graph is showing is that vmware is sort<br>of running that workload in the order of<br>10 times slower than running on a<br>physical computer so if you take that<br>workload and you run it on vmware then<br>rather than getting full physical<br>computer speed you get a tenth of that<br>speed<br>in the same test zen is coming in at 95<br>percent of the speed so you're taking a<br>5 performance hit by having<br>virtualization now this wasn't something<br>which they were really expecting to<br>discover the cambridge team were just<br>putting their ideas together and trying<br>to build a thing which is an open source<br>system but this is the point was that<br>xen ended up being free libra in the<br>sense that it didn't have restrictions<br>on its code was gpl's but otherwise it<br>was shared in the same way as the linux<br>code base it was open source and it was<br>much much faster you see the worst<br>performance that zen ever gets is still<br>above 90 speed here so this is really<br>kind of crucial<br>somewhere else in the world at that time<br>we have amazon beavering away they were<br>running a very successful bookstore and<br>selling other goods uh in the e-commerce<br>world as it was<br>and then realized that actually their<br>expertise in being able to kind of sell<br>books and run these online stores wasn't<br>something that had to be particular to<br>amazon why shouldn't they try to resell<br>their ability to do e-commerce websites<br>to other organizations like target in<br>the u.s and in fact that was indeed one<br>of their clients so the idea was that<br>you could<br>essentially take the amazoness out of<br>the amazon ecommerce platform and use it<br>for other e-commerce platforms<br>so in this case that's what started<br>leading to this this system amazon web<br>services now nowadays if you say aws or<br>amazon web services people think of that<br>being a cloud provider but of course the<br>word cloud is not in that term because<br>indeed it came along before the cloud it<br>first appeared as a sort of blog post<br>which was amazon describing how they<br>were kind of trying to turn what they<br>were doing into this sort of system of<br>decoupled web services rather than<br>having everything tightly coupled the<br>amazon-ness into the e-commerceness so<br>they kind of pulled those things apart<br>and they launched these services around<br>2006 to the greater internet or the rest<br>of the internet i'm not sure if it's<br>greater or not um from amazon's<br>perspective the simple storage service<br>s3 came out in march 2006 and then<br>quickly followed we had the elastic<br>compute cloud ec2 in august 2006 very<br>very soon after now the key point is<br>that ec2 the elastic compute cloud is<br>the first of these examples at scale<br>where you could have pay as you go<br>computing as a service so we're<br>beginning to get to the as a service<br>theme of this talk you didn't need to<br>have physical computers anymore you<br>could simply hire the ability to do<br>computing on amazon's infrastructure but<br>the thing which was really cool about<br>this was that it used this used zen the<br>cambridge technology to actually make<br>this work so it the original launch used<br>zen as the mechanism in ec2 to host<br>linux virtual machines<br>now one set of people thought this was<br>kind of cool but also rather surprising<br>were the cambridge people who had<br>absolutely no idea that amazon were<br>going to use zen to actually launch the<br>cloud but you've got to say that<br>released it openly and the price was<br>right looked amazon liked the price and<br>amazon had a team of good engineers so<br>they ran with it and indeed that's where<br>the cloud came from but it wasn't all<br>problematic for the cambridge mob and<br>checking back in on the resource<br>efficiency i wanted to reality check<br>another part of what was developing in<br>this picture<br>then had another really useful impact<br>not everybody was ready to move to the<br>cloud straight away it's still the case<br>that not everyone is going to move<br>everything to the cloud even today<br>but zen had another major impact which<br>was the efficiency of local<br>virtualization so virtualization you'd<br>use in your own machine room even if you<br>had no intention of shifting your<br>workloads to the cloud<br>they formed a company zen server<br>incorporated that developed as a service<br>organization around the open source zen<br>system and essentially positioned itself<br>as a vmware competitor they weren't<br>trying to be commercially competitive<br>specifically but they had this thing<br>that was kind of good so they might as<br>well use it of course vmware didn't have<br>to worry about zen secrets because there<br>weren't because it was open source<br>anyway so vmware were welcome to look at<br>what zen had done and incorporate those<br>technologies themselves that's fine<br>that's what open source is all about and<br>that's indeed what happened so the<br>useful point was we got the viability of<br>cheap high efficiency virtualization<br>being proven that you didn't have to<br>worry about that overhead you could take<br>all of those multiple computers you were<br>running in your machine room and crunch<br>them down to a smaller number of servers<br>now in this case i've depicted and it's<br>not drawn to scale it's on the svg<br>clipart anyway i've drawn a whole bunch<br>of servers that have gone to a smaller<br>number of servers and the point here is<br>that you don't consolidate everything<br>down to one server because that server<br>might literally catch on fire in which<br>case is kind of inconvenient if you lose<br>everything that server was doing for a<br>period of time so normally you'll have<br>at least two servers so that one can<br>literally catch on fire and the other<br>one can take over while you put out the<br>fire and replace the burnt computer and<br>get another one back in there to take<br>its job again but the consolidation<br>ratios were the point it was not<br>uncommon to see aggregation factors of<br>12 to 1 so 12 physical computers could<br>be run on one physical computer a<br>massive power saving which we've held<br>forward since that time so that's a kind<br>of example of a very useful carry-on<br>that happened that wasn't in the cloud<br>but was based on that cloud technology<br>so let's zoom through what then happened<br>with an as a service i've painted the<br>point that we've got to having computing<br>as a service we'll kind of run up the<br>stack of software to sort of see where<br>the as the services get us and then talk<br>about the other points that i want to<br>cover tonight<br>what i've shown on the right is a figure<br>that will stay on for the next couple of<br>slides so you can consult it if you uh<br>so choose over time i'm trying to<br>indicate a couple of different points<br>here<br>i'm not sure if the colors are exactly<br>the same they're slightly similar to the<br>previous one<br>the previous diagram that i showed here<br>what i'm showing you is the way that<br>you've got different layers of software<br>in a software stack that you might run<br>and here i'm kind of showing how you can<br>slice off different amounts of concern<br>different abstraction levels that you<br>might choose to use<br>as a client of cloud computing so one of<br>the key points about the on-demand<br>purchase of access to virtual machines<br>which is something which i kind of<br>understand at least in theory is the<br>whole commerce thing so i've kind of<br>summarized most of what i know about<br>commerce and that second bullet point<br>not entirely true i'm sure all academics<br>will need mba soon within the current<br>university system trends but the point<br>that i'm saying here that's important is<br>with it we have now capital expenditure<br>where you used to have to buy machines<br>and buy space for machine rooms buy air<br>conditioners and you didn't even know<br>exactly how many you needed because you<br>weren't sure how many clients you had<br>all that stuff stops being capital<br>expenditure and starts being operating<br>expenditure and it doesn't even<br>necessarily matter if it's slightly more<br>expensive as operating expenditure than<br>it was is capex because the advantages<br>it scales really nicely so if you say<br>every one of my clients i'm going to<br>budget this amount of operating<br>expenditure for my cloud costs then if<br>you get 200 more clients you just pay<br>200 times more cloud cost and that's<br>totally fine you don't need to think<br>whoa my machine room's full i need to<br>find another building you know which is<br>a problem that you have if you're<br>dealing with physical servers so it's<br>really kind of transformative for<br>organizations that need to work with<br>these sorts of costs but the other point<br>is elasticity not only do you need to<br>you can change that scale you can change<br>the scale really quickly so if someone<br>kind of comes along and says oh there's<br>a load spike now we have hundreds of<br>users arriving right now you can<br>suddenly provision a lot more servers<br>and essentially be a much bigger<br>organization briefly<br>for the cloud providers you also get<br>economies of scale they can build really<br>really efficient data centers in terms<br>of the cooling and the energy and all<br>the type of parts that they need to<br>handle on their side as well but if<br>you're a client you still have to manage<br>the operating system and software<br>updates for that which happen all the<br>time because operating systems terribly<br>insecure and all the software over the<br>top what if you just wanted a really big<br>database and like sure it might need 10<br>machines or 100 machines you don't care<br>you just want to pay for that big<br>database that's where we get platform as<br>a service so you change the level of<br>abstraction to be higher up the software<br>stack now instead of managing servers<br>you're managing services i'd never say<br>the words like that except for that<br>illustrative purpose but so the point is<br>you stop having to think about the<br>computer servers and start being able to<br>say i just want a big database acquire<br>time your database might be running on<br>two virtual machines a busy time it's<br>running on 100 but you don't have to<br>care because the clients can ignore the<br>virtual machines you just pay in terms<br>of database accesses not in terms of<br>having to compute virtual machine hours<br>that you need to rent or something like<br>that<br>however you still need to manage the<br>software what if you just want to have<br>email in a web browser and you don't<br>want to have to think about any of those<br>other concerns like how big your<br>database is that's where we zoom up to<br>software as a service which is the sort<br>of topmost level of the big three as a<br>service uh monikers that are applied<br>that's where your local computer now<br>just becomes this kind of window onto<br>the cloud so it's showing you cloud<br>software typical examples would be<br>productivity suites google workspaces<br>they keep changing the name i think it's<br>currently called google workspace office<br>365 which is missing some of the year i<br>don't quite get that either and icloud<br>which no one uses so that's kind of a<br>collection of all of your big<br>productivity why use that which of<br>course has caused all the technical<br>problems this evening which is why i'm<br>waving my phone around anyway so that's<br>an example of the three big kind of<br>providers giving you these these<br>productivity software<br>you just see that as a window from your<br>computer okay that's the authoritative<br>data is now off in the cloud but it's<br>much more than a fancy website<br>like rather than just being some kind of<br>thing that you can access through the<br>web it really is the point that it feels<br>like fully featured software like sure<br>you might use a web browser but it<br>doesn't feel any less effective than<br>running a fully functional piece of<br>software on your own local computer<br>that's partly because browsers have got<br>ridiculously powerful and include a huge<br>amount of technology within them and it<br>also doesn't mean that you can't do a<br>really bad job of this but that's a<br>separate point<br>the other thing which i find<br>characterizes software as a service is<br>often you get another player in the<br>picture so you often will get the tenant<br>of the software as a service might be<br>the organization that you work for as an<br>employee and then they configure the<br>service that you actually use so at the<br>university of otago we've gone mostly<br>microsoft we have<br>office 365 so like the email system<br>there we have the mail admins of the<br>university they work with microsoft to<br>figure out how to customize what we then<br>see as staff members at the university<br>of otago of our email when it delivers<br>it etc<br>so that's the kind of software as a<br>service<br>cell the interesting point now is that<br>increasingly we're getting the ability<br>to integrate and customize software even<br>though none of it's running on your<br>computer so that's been something where<br>we've seen great developments is the<br>ability to link together these different<br>services in the cloud so all of this is<br>happening remote from where you actually<br>are<br>and that gives us this situation we get<br>to everything as a service i'm not quite<br>done i've still got a bit more to talk<br>about but that is nonetheless the title<br>of the talk so we kind of reached the<br>pinnacle in terms of the upward journey<br>towards getting to everything as a<br>service<br>they then gave an acronym to it which<br>doesn't quite work in terms of the<br>spelling at all it's a bit odd but<br>that's fine we'll run with it xaas or<br>sometimes star ais is talking about this<br>umbrella term of everything being in the<br>cloud and so what you end up now is a<br>whole series of offerings like<br>securities or service networks as a<br>service storage service desktops<br>databases whatever<br>as a service technically most of these i<br>would say are actually just a specific<br>type of one of the three layers i've<br>already talked about before that they're<br>just sort of differentiated for a<br>particular client offering but what this<br>now means is that as a um a business<br>owner well i've ever been one i've<br>always been in the academic system but<br>let's assume that i understood how to be<br>a business owner i could run a small<br>business from a cafe<br>all the key business things that i need<br>can be accessed from a web browser<br>sitting in the cafe let's assume the<br>wi-fi stays up business goes broke due<br>to wi-fi failing in cafe it's a cafe<br>with good wi-fi<br>the point here is you've got customer<br>relationship management systems issue<br>management accounting payments gateways<br>your document management a way to<br>communicate and a coffee all of that in<br>front of you in the convenience of this<br>kind of cafe environment no data centers<br>no fixed costs to run large big chunks<br>of iron to make your system work and<br>everything scales up and down as you<br>need it to depending on what you're<br>currently doing<br>nice challenges<br>now admittedly this is like a couple of<br>snippets that i've taken i have a little<br>file where i keep when software fails<br>because i find failing software really<br>interesting when software fails like<br>kind of little sort of clips of it and i<br>thought for tonight it worked because i<br>could give you a clip of all of the<br>major cloud providers losing my data at<br>some time now admittedly i have a knack<br>for breaking software whenever i touch<br>it i'm not trying to but i just seem to<br>be able to automatically but here's<br>google losing data microsoft losing data<br>icloud losing data someone's just doing<br>web wrong and the dialog box on the top<br>is actually not relevant to the cloud<br>but i just thought it's such an awesome<br>example of programming ending up<br>accidentally putting an internal message<br>to the user shh bad news coming it's<br>like indeed cyber security it's a<br>challenge now security problems have<br>been growing both with and orthogonal to<br>the cloud<br>early cloud adoption was often blocked<br>just outright by security concerns so<br>your organization would say<br>absolutely no way are we going to be<br>shifting that database into the cloud<br>you've got to be kidding like it's got<br>to stay on premises like that's<br>absolutely not going to the cloud a few<br>years later you now get to the situation<br>where the organizations are like there's<br>absolutely no way that we're going to<br>try to safely store that data on site<br>it's absolutely going to the cloud<br>that's not necessarily the case for<br>everything but it has been a trend the<br>main constant here is that cyber<br>security is a problem but the cloud<br>plays a role in what sorts of ways we<br>can both protect against it and other<br>things we still need to fix<br>originally data safety was being equated<br>with locality if you had the data close<br>to you it was safe but the problem with<br>that is that the different sorts of<br>threats and attacks evolved we have much<br>much more ransomware and malware that<br>attacks on-site systems so that was kind<br>of a situation where now actually the<br>cloud providers have economies of scale<br>in terms of security<br>why how well for a start they have<br>global visibility if people are going to<br>start attacking things they see that<br>coming from anywhere because they've got<br>their own network infrastructure that<br>connects the globe<br>one of the downsides is that it does<br>mean that all the defenses that you<br>actually have are very likely to be<br>homogeneous because you're all using the<br>same cloud thing so when a cloud<br>fundamental security problem happens<br>there is much scrambling because<br>suddenly the cloud provider has to fix<br>everything at once that has happened<br>with examples for the intel cpu bugs<br>like the things that cause spectra and<br>meltdown those meant that there would<br>have been a lot of amazon engineers and<br>all the other big cloud providers losing<br>quite a lot of sleep because they had to<br>patch every single one of their servers<br>and again the number of servers that<br>they run are just crazy numbers so we<br>don't know for sure because it's a<br>commercial secret but we're definitely<br>in the millions and if you think of what<br>it means to have millions of servers<br>that's just crazy but nonetheless uh it<br>is an interesting situation if you're a<br>security person there<br>another challenge is that there are just<br>so many different stakeholders involved<br>so the cloud technology in some senses<br>may sometimes actually even be the easy<br>part compared to the coordination that<br>has to occur between all these different<br>participants and this has become more<br>clear as you run this kind of business<br>for longer and you start seeing more of<br>the wrinkles that are going to happen<br>when commerce depends on this as<br>infrastructure but so the the list i've<br>shown here is not complete but it's even<br>just a start you've got cloud providers<br>you've got cloud customers you've got<br>the end users like most of us you've got<br>regulators legislators you've got law<br>enforcement playing a part as well you<br>need to coordinate all those<br>interactions<br>the cloud data processing is by its<br>nature like dynamic really fast<br>outsourcing so sort of the analogy is<br>like if you're trying to build a house<br>and you discover that the service<br>contract for putting in a brick wall<br>involved every brick being dynamically<br>priced from any builder anywhere on the<br>planet you can see how that would get<br>rather complicated to actually figure<br>out what's going on it's easy to explain<br>what you're doing with the dynamic<br>market but it might be hard to actually<br>build the brick wall in a way where you<br>know who's responsible for what<br>so how do you protect against data<br>despite all of its international<br>transfer and how do you even track<br>what's going on in terms of how the data<br>is changing hands so a call out to the<br>european union as is not uncommon from<br>people who have left the uk to come to<br>new zealand and now watch the uk leaving<br>the eu we have to kind of mention all<br>the good things the eu continues to do<br>general data protection regulation that<br>is one for us as citizens gdpr has done<br>a huge amount in terms of protecting<br>the privacy the protection of your<br>personal data of course new zealand is<br>not in the eu but the advantage of the<br>eu being so big is that if they do<br>something like that then we'll also<br>receive the notifications we all<br>received in 2018 saying we're going to<br>change our terms and conditions because<br>of the gdpr blah blah blah the world<br>isn't worth segregating or segregating<br>between the eu and everywhere else so we<br>got the benefits of the kind of uh<br>personal data privacy that's come from<br>that sort of eu initiative and new<br>zealand has strengthened that so<br>absolutely the new zealand government<br>has played its part well there too but<br>another challenge national data<br>sovereignty<br>so data processing is often outsourced<br>overseas now if that starts including<br>your citizens personal information or<br>healthcare records or things like that<br>how do you start protecting what's<br>actually nationally significant and<br>that's the data sovereignty question<br>maori data sovereignty is a particular<br>aspect of that that raises some<br>interesting questions that many of which<br>will probably be discussed in the panel<br>it's in this lecture series on the 25th<br>of may which because i wrote a long time<br>ago that's actually otherwise known as<br>next week<br>now<br>so next week<br>but for now i think that we've got the<br>case that data sovereignty often assumes<br>this idea that local equals safe and i<br>think that we're going to have to<br>probably evolve from that over time just<br>to feed some discussion to next week<br>before it's even happened no nation can<br>avoid technology supply chain attacks<br>and that's been one of the recent things<br>we've started to see happening and<br>everyone is intermeshed in terms of<br>supply chain dynamics right now<br>china's recently again said they want to<br>clear out western equipment from you<br>know government offices and have<br>chinese-made equipment it's just not<br>that easy that's been tried multiple<br>times china can't do it the west can't<br>clear the chinese stuff out necessarily<br>it's everything is intertwined no<br>country is self-sufficient in terms of<br>computing or data either if you close<br>down the walls and don't allow anyone in<br>for maintaining your data infrastructure<br>you're going to discover you've got some<br>real problems when things start breaking<br>because we simply don't have engineers<br>that can do all the things you need to<br>do to fix all of that equipment so in<br>future i think we're going to likely<br>need specific multinational technical<br>protections that are agreed to sort of<br>treaties between different countries<br>sounds sort of like the eu i'm going on<br>about that again not quite but say for<br>us in new zealand you know we might pick<br>australia maybe i don't know maybe that<br>depends on what happens this weekend<br>um<br>another challenge you're getting here is<br>on the other side the provider side<br>concentrated commercial control<br>originally the internet and the web were<br>highly resilient organizationally they<br>could handle failures of infrastructure<br>and keep working<br>but commercial pressures have driven<br>economies of scale what you now have is<br>the core cloud is a very small number of<br>very large providers<br>okay and that doesn't matter whether or<br>not you include all the chinese<br>providers or not you're still talking<br>about a very very small number of very<br>very big organizations now we're seeing<br>some potential regulation on the social<br>media horizon some governments are<br>unhappy at the degree of social media<br>company scale some other governments are<br>quite happy with it it depends which<br>governments you're talking about this<br>also relates to cloud law<br>it's difficult to have legal protections<br>work when these cloud providers are<br>international and of themselves<br>nation-scale organizations they are that<br>large but again the eu is helping us out<br>recently we've had two areas of great<br>progress the digital services act which<br>is focusing more on<br>misinformation in social media campaigns<br>and controlling that kind of the<br>information on social media platforms<br>but also the digital markets act there's<br>the term given to these very large<br>providers of being the gatekeepers and<br>so the digital markets act is trying to<br>tackle those gatekeepers for eu<br>companies meaning that if you want to do<br>something innovative in the cloud space<br>you don't have to first magically become<br>the scale of amazon before you can even<br>start kind of working in that space so<br>again that's going to be interesting to<br>see how that develops there are<br>different then they're not like they're<br>not actually regulations yet they're<br>still in formation but it'll be<br>interesting to see where they go<br>so on to the future now again there's a<br>panel discussion as i mentioned about<br>the new zealand and what's going to<br>happen in terms of the cloud future so i<br>won't be taking their thunder but what<br>i'm going to try to illustrate here is<br>the trajectory i think cloud's going to<br>take<br>computing on our data i mean very<br>broadly like sort of the most of the<br>computing happening on most of our data<br>i'm not trying to talk about every<br>specific instance it's shifted where<br>it's happened over time so in the start<br>you have this big iron up in the top<br>left your mainframes your gigantic<br>business computers that could crunch<br>numbers but you had to bring all the<br>records to that centralized location we<br>then had this proliferation heading down<br>the right hand side to the decentralized<br>part of the axis here where you have<br>personal computers and for a while you<br>carry the data around on floppy disks or<br>cds or zip disks and other exotic forms<br>of media that probably don't work<br>anymore if you can find a drive to even<br>try them out i love that stuff but<br>anyway that's another topic so the pcs<br>kind of started having all the data<br>being carried around by people using<br>sneakernet to kind of copy the data from<br>location to location now over time we've<br>kind of now shifted back to something<br>which is much more like cloud computing<br>uh it's centralized we have most of the<br>data now working there even when we have<br>decentralized computing like people with<br>smartphones which is pretty much<br>everyone<br>a lot of the things we do are still<br>cloud-backed okay so the cloud is an<br>important part sure the smartphone can<br>do a lot by itself but the general data<br>crunching is likely to involve cloud<br>interactions so i would say the past<br>might predict the future you could say<br>that i'm extrapolating from two data<br>points anyway i think we've already<br>started seeing some of the trends that<br>kind of indicate that this is actually<br>what's happening for a start we're<br>beginning to see<br>things like um decentralization with ai<br>and machine learning happening in mobile<br>phones that's a very sensible insane<br>technological development to support<br>privacy because it means you can do<br>useful things but on the device we've<br>also seen web 3 and decentralized<br>finance which is i'm sure it's got goals<br>as well<br>uh and that's also decentralized and<br>we'll see where that stabilizes in<br>future<br>shifting out from the cloud<br>getting closer to the users is going to<br>become important and again there's<br>another talk in the series this year<br>talking about how we shouldn't assume<br>that everyone has access to fiber optic<br>you know broadband uh actually access to<br>the internet is not global by any means<br>but in places where you are able to get<br>5g for your super fast connectivity to<br>your smartphones it's not particularly<br>useful if all you get is really high<br>fidelity spinners telling you that<br>you're waiting for a cloud server so<br>what you want to start doing is creating<br>a local loop of computation and you can<br>do that by dropping computing down at<br>the cell phone tower<br>this extends the cloud but it still<br>depends very heavily on the cloud this<br>is very much already happening right now<br>there's a lot of data working in this<br>way with content delivery networks which<br>are very common way to push data out<br>towards users the internet of things and<br>i've just sort of taken a c a creative<br>commons license picture of a raspberry<br>pi enhanced toaster in the theme of<br>uh this sort of iot toaster the internet<br>of things i've characterized here and<br>apologies for any interactive things<br>researchers are sort of adding software<br>storage and networking to all<br>electronics that's sort of the internet<br>of things broadly speaking today i would<br>say it's still the case that internet of<br>things devices are fleets that are<br>managed through the cloud because that's<br>the easiest way to make this work it was<br>discovered rapidly that configuring all<br>the devices independently is actually<br>really quite painful so it's useful if<br>they can call back to the cloud and have<br>their configuration managed that way<br>that also means that if your toaster<br>breaks that you don't lose the data of<br>your perfectly you know toasted bagel<br>settings you get a new toaster and the<br>cloud will download your bagel settings<br>so you can continue in your toasted<br>toroidal nirvana<br>in future though what we need to do in<br>terms of making this actually much more<br>functional is make it secure and private<br>and interoperable of which those are<br>huge failings at the moment resilient<br>and power efficient because just because<br>we can move things away from needing<br>really really big chunky data centers<br>like the ones that i've shown here on<br>the left<br>that doesn't mean that we should be just<br>using energy because we can we should be<br>thinking about why we're using the<br>energy i've sort of sketched this as<br>just an abstract example it's a little<br>bit down the smart cities line which is<br>kind of more of an engine of things<br>thing but i'm borrowing it here i like<br>the idea of thinking that we'll get to a<br>point of something more like ambient<br>computing where we have nomadic code and<br>data the devices become irrelevant<br>except for the input of the output that<br>they perform relative to where they are<br>in the environment<br>what we will need for that to work is<br>have ways of making collaborative<br>provision<br>do so safely and with reliable computing<br>and data right now though we simply<br>cannot commit to this given the current<br>state of security and regulation in the<br>technology stacks we're dealing with<br>which is not ready we can't sensibly do<br>this yet i want to leave you on a<br>different as a service that i think<br>personally is possibly one of the<br>paradigm shifts that could be huge or i<br>could just be wrong but that's okay<br>we'll find out later function as a<br>service which is also known as<br>serverless i try to use the term<br>function as a service because it does<br>use servers which means it's serverless<br>it's a slightly strange misleading term<br>function as a service the idea is that<br>you take the actual computations you<br>want to perform and you push them into<br>the cloud a little bit like the line of<br>my ambient vision here they could float<br>to where they need to go to do the work<br>they need to do<br>most software is imperative at the<br>moment you instruct the computer step by<br>step so the python listing up here i'm<br>supposed to supposed to talk for 40<br>minutes we get 10 minutes of questions<br>that's the total time for the talk it'll<br>print the total now if it turns out to<br>be wrong when i start writing overtime<br>in about 10 seconds you need to change<br>that number and then you need to rerun<br>that program so it goes and takes the<br>variables and recomputes the total and<br>figures out how long i actually ended up<br>talking for<br>now that's a bit inconvenient compared<br>to the other type of programming that i<br>think works really nicely which is data<br>flow programming and most people have<br>experienced this because many people<br>have used spreadsheets spreadsheets are<br>a form of doing data flow programming<br>and there the data recomputes the<br>outputs when the inputs change and we're<br>starting to see forms of that that can<br>actually operate at internet scale and<br>can distribute in a very flexible way<br>function as a service is kind of heading<br>in that direction and that's great for<br>at least two reasons you can might<br>migrate the functions towards where the<br>data is so when the data changes you're<br>close to those functions and you can<br>recompute effectively or even recompute<br>redundantly if you need to but you can<br>also migrate the functions to where<br>you've got energy because it turns out<br>that shipping energy around is actually<br>really expensive shipping computing and<br>data around is comparatively cheap so<br>it's good to have a model where you can<br>actually follow renewable energy sources<br>or spikes of energy the thing which i<br>really like about this as a function as<br>a service<br>is starting to appear both in the cloud<br>and already at the edge as well which to<br>me seems like a kind of sign that we<br>might be going down a paradigm shift<br>so some take away points i think that<br>the cloud is going to it's provided new<br>abstractions that are definitely here to<br>stay the data in computing locality is<br>very likely to change in future<br>jurisdiction and regulation and cloud<br>law and all of that is going to need a<br>big boost for us to figure out where we<br>need to stand and where we need to go<br>we've really got to fix security um they<br>call that to you giovanni not<br>specifically it's not entirely your<br>problem but i mean you know security is<br>important for research we have to look<br>at security and privacy and the things<br>connected with that and with that come<br>to an agreement of what we mean by<br>sovereignty and how we choose to be<br>comfortable with that i think we're<br>going to shift to decentralized<br>hopefully we won't go techno-libertarian<br>let's see where that ends up<br>finally i think we need to look at<br>reducing power consumption a lot of<br>noise has been made about efficiency<br>which is great it's excellent to have<br>efficient data centers and efficient<br>computers but we also need to think<br>about purpose there are clearly some<br>places in the world right now where<br>people are doing a vast amount of number<br>crunching on data that is not worth the<br>energy that's spent on that number<br>crunching so i think collectively we<br>need to come to some agreement as to<br>what is a reasonable purpose on which to<br>do computing and put that into the<br>equation of considering power<br>consumption<br>okay so we've now got 10 minutes for<br>questions as you all know so what<br>questions<br>if you don't ask questions i'll just<br>because you've suddenly got these legal<br>considerations and things that might<br>mean the locality of where you work<br>becomes<br>a problem<br>is that going to lead to move away from<br>the centralized cloud<br>i'd say sort of probably yes and now and<br>it depends and examples that spring to<br>mind you look at a place like i mean<br>dropbox have already done this in the<br>sense that they ended up<br>drawing different parts of their data<br>into different countries data centers<br>because of this very fact<br>for them it's like once you get to that<br>scale you can simplify your operations<br>by just going if we you bit and the not<br>eu bit and a lot of the really big<br>companies have a division like that<br>apparently google has a division between<br>data that can be requested to be deleted<br>and everything else because they realize<br>if they didn't make that partition they<br>would just get themselves tangled in a<br>gigantic mess because if you're their<br>scale it's actually really hard to<br>delete things because they have so many<br>backups of everything and type drives<br>and all the rest of it so it's actually<br>really hard and from a legal perspective<br>if someone says do you still have that<br>record if your answer is<br>i don't know then that's not going to<br>really hold up in a court of law<br>absolutely i think this is going to be a<br>very interesting type of pressure i<br>think what's likely to happen is it will<br>create a commercial driver for brokers<br>that simplify this and so you'll end up<br>with you still need to be pretty big but<br>in a way it's kind of like the mega edge<br>you might get someone who becomes a kind<br>of local broker and i think that's a<br>perfect role to investigate in new<br>zealand where we've got this interesting<br>mix of<br>what is not likely to come to new<br>zealand by the way of high-scale<br>computing of course we are getting data<br>centers from the big providers but<br>amazon have already indicated they're<br>not putting a complete availability<br>region here it's a kind of smaller<br>availability region it's like okay well<br>what's not coming we'll find out when<br>they actually finish it so yeah i think<br>absolutely that will create an<br>interesting<br>transition and i think<br>there's different players that have<br>different pressures in that space but it<br>will definitely be a rocky road for some<br>and they may end up settling with<br>something like this broker solution or<br>having to get to a scale where they<br>actually just change what they do<br>i mean the dropbox ones and everything<br>from one for me because that's an<br>example where dropbox were essentially<br>an amazon driven thing for a long time<br>and then eventually they got to the<br>scale where they crunched the numbers<br>and went actually now the cloud's not<br>good value for us anymore it is actually<br>worth us going out and doing the opex<br>and<br>actually buying capex and actually<br>that's my commerce knowledge coming<br>through again the capex is actually<br>worth buying data centers in the<br>different places because we're so big<br>that's actually going to be cheaper for<br>us and then also it means your legal<br>teams can be spotted around the<br>different places that's an excellent<br>question<br>the interactions between malware and<br>data breaches<br>yeah that's a very good question uh<br>i i think that in terms of the<br>interactions there i kind of tried to<br>not give a clear answer on the security<br>slide saying that at one hand there were<br>these like things that local does better<br>and on the other hand there are things<br>that the cloud does better<br>when it comes to things like malware the<br>visibility that these organizations have<br>is really very good but as i said the<br>problem is that if you have something<br>like heterogeneity<br>a problem can occur that's going to<br>suddenly take out a very large number of<br>services and so you'd assume that<br>the large<br>threats which are probably nation-scale<br>players or particularly big criminal<br>organizations or whatever probably have<br>their fingers poised over buttons that<br>they know could take out chunks of<br>infrastructure we've seen failures that<br>have been quite large-scale that have<br>happened in content delivery networks so<br>i mentioned those briefly that's where<br>you get a kind of caching layer that's<br>pushed out from the cloud for data<br>objects in many cases organizations<br>designs aren't resilient to the cdn<br>failing they should potentially be<br>because it should just go back to origin<br>servers and still continue to work but<br>often it doesn't and so we've seen a<br>number of times recently where glitches<br>on<br>cdns have actually taken out much more<br>infrastructure than should have been<br>taken out the difficulty is how you kind<br>of test this because most organizations<br>don't want your cloud provider to say<br>every third sunday of the month we're<br>just going to like randomly fail and<br>let's see what your software does it is<br>what yahoo do they've decided that if<br>they want to stand obviously not to<br>their customers<br>but yahoo internally they wanted to know<br>that their resilience measures actually<br>work so they actually do a test run i<br>don't know who gets to pull the switch<br>but someone gets to essentially yank the<br>power supply out from one of their data<br>centers and they just check that<br>everything continues to work because<br>everything's supposed to continue to<br>work but i mean as you probably often<br>hear people discover the blank backup<br>tapes that don't have any data on them<br>and that's only discovered after the<br>failure occurs so definitely some<br>absolutely but the commercial<br>responsibility stuff then leaves my<br>technically minded understanding because<br>i mean if you look at so with the cloud<br>uh paper that that i run down as an<br>undergrad paper third year paper looking<br>at the cloud law that we we examined if<br>you look at the terms of service of is<br>that my time up<br>totally up um the if you look at the<br>terms of service of most cloud providers<br>and they might have all changed i<br>haven't checked like last week but i<br>think probably haven't most cloud<br>providers legal agreements say<br>effectively we don't give you any<br>guarantees so like literally if they<br>you uploaded your data and the next day<br>they said oh we deleted it all you<br>wouldn't have to sue them because you<br>actually signed up to a service contract<br>that said that's fine<br>and it's not even it's not even best<br>effort<br>they say<br>well we<br>our best efforts in our best effort we<br>say<br>99<br>yeah and we're in a weird position there<br>like again software engineering as we<br>know a little software licensing i'm not<br>going to blame software engineers uh<br>software licensing is odd like compared<br>to what you'd expect in terms of handing<br>over a completed civil engineering<br>project like a bridge people will keep<br>some responsibility for its<br>functionality you write software to<br>control an autonomous car it's not so<br>clear i mean it's not clear that you end<br>up being directly responsible for that<br>it's just not clear and that's a<br>situation which is likely to need to<br>change and i mean as you know from the<br>way we write software at the moment it's<br>it's not an easy thing to shift at the<br>moment that will be very interesting<br>my question is<br>how much do you think that incentive<br>is shaping the direction of iot<br>versus<br>um<br>we want our system to be secure<br>that's a great question so the to say<br>that the most big cloud providers are<br>connected to advertising companies like<br>is this a coincidence um does that mean<br>that we're going to have a similar<br>pressure on internet of things with<br>respect to being interested in people's<br>data<br>right now we have the problem we've got<br>no way to express the management of<br>concerns about our data so some people<br>might be willing to sell some of their<br>data if they knew how that worked but<br>that's not the agreement you go into<br>with facebook i mean it's just like it's<br>open open show you know so this is a<br>sort of difficult situation there i<br>think that will evolve<br>it's i'm not sure i think that there's a<br>sort of i see it almost as being two<br>levels like the retail iot devices i<br>suspect that you'll have your loyalty<br>programs and stuff that will be very<br>strong you know it means that your<br>fridge understands when your washing is<br>done and figures out something useful<br>about that and makes you a bagel or<br>whatever i don't think that's going to<br>be going to me i don't find myself so<br>advertising connected there but that's<br>one level i don't think that's the only<br>place that we're going to go<br>because again one of the standout<br>players in this space the ones that<br>probably aren't so much advertising<br>involved ibm and microsoft are making<br>very big pushes into we do it securely<br>and that's been like that's a big sell<br>for whether actually google are doing a<br>security sell as well but they're also<br>trying to kind of no they're not not<br>being evil anymore are they they stop<br>that anyway whatever um the google world<br>is doing its own thing but the microsoft<br>offerings one of the things which has<br>been interesting there is this idea of<br>trusted computing and so<br>intel for example developed their secure<br>guard extension cpu extensions that's<br>where you run encrypted software on the<br>cpu unfortunately you have to trust that<br>intel got the implementation right and<br>they've demonstrated a lot of mistakes<br>recently which might make you worried<br>but that kind of thing is appearing in<br>some areas of the cloud where the idea<br>is that the cloud provider is trying to<br>make it abundantly clear that they have<br>no idea what you're doing<br>so they're actually trying to outsource<br>the ability to do computing with no<br>knowledge about the data because they<br>never see it decrypted um so homomorphic<br>encryption and things like that that can<br>actually do useful computation on<br>encrypted data those technologies exist<br>uh and they're starting to be really<br>adopted as a sell for the security<br>concerned companies but for me i see<br>that as being two ends of the spectrum<br>probably that way two ends of a spectrum<br>um i think that i'm not sure there'll be<br>an affinity on both sides i think you'll<br>end up with a lot of consumer data<br>gathering and<br>data mining in that space that's one of<br>my concerns for energy by the way is<br>like the amount to which everything you<br>do will be kind of you know fed into<br>machine learning systems to optimize<br>different retail patterns everywhere and<br>again i just think we need to say look<br>what is the net value to society of<br>doing that and what's the cost and then<br>that other infrastructure stuff where i<br>do think we'll get more of the trusted<br>computing actually being a solid base<br>that will be encrypted and protected<br>again it will be you know viable it'll<br>be liable to attacks but it will be<br>trying to have providers that really<br>don't know anything about what you're<br>um<br>so when we talk about sovereignty and<br>ownership<br>so i think again i'd split my answer<br>between infrastructure that will just<br>stay kind of broadly connected to<br>geography and where undersea cables go<br>and sort of infrastructure concerns like<br>that<br>to concerns of that kind of uh affinity<br>to<br>commercial organizations that would be a<br>really interesting one to to play out i<br>don't think i could pick where that's<br>going to go by any means i am aware that<br>there is a tendency and this is mostly<br>just going to be a big disclaimer<br>there's a tendency for<br>researchers perhaps of my age and my<br>generation to assume that other<br>generations may think the same way that<br>i do about you know privacy for example<br>and they may be completely wrong<br>well i know that generations think<br>differently about privacy so from that<br>perspective i would self-check what i<br>believe would be what we should be<br>trying to achieve in that space but what<br>i do think we miss at the moment is<br>sensible<br>user queryable accountability and so<br>this connects to<br>you're involved with veracity project<br>that theme is important here this idea<br>that you want to find out what<br>is actually happening you might not care<br>you might be actively enjoying that but<br>right now most services provide you a<br>way of taking out your data that's great<br>that's just like you kind of open a hose<br>and this thing just plops a whole bunch<br>of garbage in front of your feet it's<br>like okay you've got the data we had on<br>you but of course you can't do anything<br>with it because like you're not running<br>their cloud service so you can't really<br>make a huge amount of sense of it and<br>you might make sense of bits of it but<br>not very much<br>that's not a very sophisticated way of<br>interacting with that kind of siloed<br>existence so irrespective of where<br>people choose to go in terms of their<br>affinities i think we still need better<br>technology to mean that you can query<br>and check what the auditing and the<br>trust relationships actually are and<br>that you play a part in that that you<br>choose to approve them and again my hope<br>is that we get to a brokerage model in<br>that space where you might say i want<br>a particular type of filtering of my<br>social media feeds<br>i'm not going to give that<br>privilege to<br>facebook but i'm going to have another<br>organization that has a big enough scale<br>of data processing to me that i'm going<br>to have my affinity be with that<br>organization it understands my values or<br>whatever and it forms this kind of<br>network that can<br>move that sort of job away from just<br>being in one behind closed doors and one<br>set of data centers to something where<br>good question i don't really know i<br>think we'll have to have to see the<br>development<br>yeah so this is a question relating to<br>where the energy comes from and<br>this sort of<br>there's a huge amount of energy that<br>goes into cloud computing like i mean<br>data centers take vast amounts of energy<br>most of the big players they have what's<br>termed hyperscale data centers which<br>just means that you know like the<br>picture i showed previously they're<br>insanely large and they're always cited<br>next to renewable energy sources you<br>know blah blah blah that's great but the<br>problem there is that you don't well<br>there's two things that are problems<br>with that one is that you're not aware<br>of all the other places that are using<br>energy so like the networking uses an<br>amount of energy to get the data around<br>and the client devices the things you<br>use to actually access the cloud take<br>energy as well<br>but there's another question which is if<br>you have that renewable energy there<br>powering that data center i mean that's<br>better than running it on coal but is<br>there an opportunity cost is it also<br>next to something which is still running<br>on coal because they can't run on<br>renewables because all renewables are<br>going into the data center and that's<br>where we really need to kind of think a<br>bit more than just the individual pieces<br>of that puzzle and right now i think we<br>don't see that because there isn't<br>really pricing that deals with<br>renewability in the energy networks to<br>the extent that we'd expect to see<br>happen and so i think that's going to be<br>an evolution where you'll get more of a<br>colored metric and people understand<br>where energy plugs into the power<br>network but the point there i think is<br>that the pricing doesn't take that into<br>account quite yet and that's what we're<br>going to see more of<br>data centers can shed a lot of load<br>so it's very likely that they can<br>minimize their consumption if they've<br>got a price signal to actually do that<br>but right now i'm not aware of that<br>happening for these sorts of really<br>large scale energy consumption areas<br>that's a whole different area of<br>interest there's a lot of development<br>happening with price signaling to manage<br>network demand and cloud computing<br>because you can shift energy around the<br>computation will actually probably play<br>quite a significant part in that<br>but at the same time pumped hydro for us<br>might be really good too<br>okay so i think we'll leave it there so<br>thank you very much once again<br>we might turn off some mics first i've<br>got lots of mics<br>all good<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
