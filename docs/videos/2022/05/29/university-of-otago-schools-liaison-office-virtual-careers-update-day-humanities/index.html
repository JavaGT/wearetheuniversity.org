otago<br>and i'm very conscious of the fact that<br>you know there are six universities in<br>which you can study study law and so<br>what is it that's special about otago<br>law has been studied at otago university<br>for 149 years it's 150th anniversary of<br>the faculty next year so that's that's<br>pretty special about our long tradition<br>and<br>we've just done a sort of what we might<br>call a marketing refresh i guess i'm<br>probably not using good technical<br>marketing language and we've come up<br>with whatever that is tagline or<br>something that study at otago's<br>unrivaled legal community and that's<br>what we're really about is about<br>community<br>and excellent study so<br>i want to share a screen with you and<br>hopefully this will work<br>and i also want to start by talking<br>about a story which<br>as we know law is about stories so with<br>a bit of luck<br>you think i was<br>experienced at this because i've been<br>doing it all year with um<br>teaching online so what you see there is<br>a group of people in their law<br>graduation gear<br>and in december 2020 we're all gathered<br>for the pre-graduation brunch<br>and you may recall that the graduation<br>that otago was cancelled that year<br>because of a bomb thresh at the town<br>hall<br>and the kind of it felt like a huge<br>buckets of cold water had been poured<br>over all these happy excited people who<br>were all dressed up and there was their<br>phono to celebrate getting their degrees<br>within an hour a group of law students<br>had organized a alternative<br>hey in terms of the presentation are you<br>able to put it on the full view because<br>it's on the present of you so it means<br>it's quite small<br>would you like to advise pradesh he's<br>our i.t expert yes slide control oh dear<br>this is this is way too hard for me this<br>is not what i do for my students sorry<br>people shall if you if you end your show<br>yeah<br>yeah if you hit in show at the top there<br>enjoy yeah<br>and if you're at the bottom of you just<br>click the right at the bottom there next<br>to comments you see the oh the full<br>screen thing the next to not that one<br>there's the one the two next to the one<br>there's the nuts not the one the four<br>little dots not the four one not the<br>book but the other one the last one<br>the last one<br>that one that you have oh better<br>oh that's weird<br>if we click use slideshow on the top<br>there use lunch<br>swap displays that should change it swap<br>to slides<br>there we go that's much better yep much<br>better awesome perfect thanks shelly<br>that's right my students have never<br>complained anyway so within an hour this<br>bunch of students had reached out to<br>each other<br>and we all met at murama hall and did a<br>virtual presentation of degrees we sang<br>guardian<br>we had an address<br>a pretend graduation address by one of<br>our professors<br>and the president of our students<br>organization that hovered up the food<br>that was left over at the graduation<br>brunch<br>and we were able to share a lot of kai<br>with our with our graduates and their<br>whanau<br>that's what otago law is about it's<br>about a a community<br>and it's about people with skills to get<br>themselves organized and to organize<br>each other and to connect with each<br>other and do some really<br>really cool things so<br>that's what your six and seven<br>performers would end up being able to do<br>if they came to law and otago so that's<br>a particular story that i think sums up<br>all the things that we're aiming for our<br>graduates so<br>backing up the bus a little bit and<br>talking a little bit about law what is<br>law as a subject<br>i mean we've all encountered law i guess<br>in our in our lives we've all<br>encountered many miscounted lawyers<br>studying law is about essentially<br>problem solving and it's problem-solving<br>in a particular kind of way<br>and so what we<br>teach students on their way to becoming<br>lawyers is about how to break a problem<br>into into issues what are the bits that<br>make up that issue<br>and then assessing what is the nature of<br>those issues some of the issues are not<br>legal issues but some of them are<br>and then working out how we might solve<br>that particular problem with law so<br>somebody who's got a dispute with their<br>neighbour<br>some of it might not be resolvable by<br>law but some of it might be so the job<br>of a lawyer is to work out what can<br>within your particular story be solved<br>by law<br>and then thinking about the different<br>consequences<br>of each solution some solutions might be<br>to go to mediation some solution might<br>be just to go<br>i just need to move on some might be to<br>go to litigation<br>some might be to get somebody else in to<br>facilitate some conversations<br>so it's considering consequences<br>some solutions are better in some<br>circumstances some solutions better than<br>others<br>so studying law is about advocating<br>solutions working out what the answer<br>might be what is the best outcome for<br>your client<br>and if we take that up to sort of<br>thinking about law as it binds all of us<br>together what is the best solution<br>perhaps for the country as well as we're<br>thinking about what law should we have<br>how should law be<br>so studying law is really about people<br>all law is about people i i teach<br>company law and i had some students say<br>to me i don't want to do company law<br>because it's not about people<br>and the simple answer is actually<br>everything<br>about law comes back to being about<br>people so what do people need what do<br>they want and how can we help within a<br>particular framework of decision<br>decision-making and and resolving<br>conflict in a way that doesn't resort to<br>years of one-on-one violence<br>so who's law for<br>well there's no one typical path for a<br>student into a law degree<br>i often when i talk to students say many<br>of you who argue with your parents your<br>parents will say you should be a lawyer<br>because you're good at arguing<br>and there's a big element of proof in<br>that<br>and what<br>law is about is arguing but in a<br>constructive and particular a particular<br>way so i wouldn't say any particular<br>kind of subject that students need to be<br>doing in high school<br>and we'll look at double degrees in a<br>minute to see just how broad this sort<br>of relationship between law and other<br>subjects is<br>it really suits the curious those who<br>are<br>who question<br>why is it like that why is it not like<br>this<br>how could it be better it re law really<br>is well designed for those who are<br>curious<br>there's a definite advantage<br>for students if they have strong<br>communication skills<br>law requires a lot of reading and i<br>can't pretend otherwise<br>in a typical lecture which could require<br>you know reading a couple of thousand<br>words of material cases statutes<br>government reports etc<br>and most of our assessment is written in<br>nature<br>the parts that aren't written uh are<br>oral advocacy and so people who have got<br>good written skills and good oral skills<br>do particularly well but if you haven't<br>got particularly strong oral skills your<br>students find that those develop through<br>through doing and practice and hearing<br>each other speak<br>but particularly that communication<br>skills really important<br>an ability to time manage and plan is<br>necessary it's<br>it's not an easy degree and i'm sure i<br>can probably see amber about to start<br>nodding um it requires a lot of<br>organization and self-organization<br>but you know<br>it's the issues nodding it's definitely<br>um doable and learning those time<br>management skills is is partly what what<br>we're about teaching<br>and<br>people who do really well have high<br>emotional intelligence this is as i said<br>in fact you go really a people business<br>law so the study of law is itself a<br>basically get great jobs<br>and i just went to mb<br>figures that calc that show you all the<br>stuff<br>and three years after graduation 63<br>are in employment<br>26<br>overseas 9 and further study and that<br>median salary is 67 000 i suspect that<br>is creeping up because i certainly know<br>that there's a bit of a shortage<br>of lawyers at the moment and there's a<br>little bit of competition out there and<br>a bit of recruitment on on money um<br>around half work in what we would call<br>practice so in either transactional law<br>you know helping people buy and sell<br>businesses and houses in family law<br>employment law<br>criminal law<br>and the other half will be engaged in<br>things like working for the government<br>working for ewe<br>working in business working as business<br>advisors and<br>what i have on this next screen is just<br>a selection of some of our recent<br>graduates<br>now the last time i showed a screen like<br>this afterwards somebody said to me<br>oh why wasn't my sister why wasn't my<br>niece on there<br>and she laughed so if your<br>daughter son niece next door neighbor<br>best friend i'm not there i apologize<br>we all have we have lots and lots of<br>great graduates but this i just chose<br>this random group and these would all be<br>people who've graduated within the last<br>or<br>five years maximum<br>just to show you what they are doing so<br>there are people working in in<br>law firms<br>one that you see is working in<br>queenstown<br>somebody else working in in monaco<br>somebody working in amsterdam and<br>somebody working in new york there are<br>people working for government<br>departments<br>and for other agencies like the commerce<br>commission<br>people working in commerce<br>hewlett hewlett-packard and people<br>working in consultancy it's a couple at<br>ey but in the iwa tahi consultancy where<br>george mohee is<br>maya is a tax consultant former student<br>of mine<br>so you'll see that it um law takes you<br>to lots and lots of places<br>not not only<br>um transactional law<br>that we would call it or the practice of<br>law<br>um in the kind of direct client contact<br>kind of way but in other ways in which<br>law<br>informs society and in which law and<br>legal skills<br>help people to do to do great and<br>interesting work<br>right so<br>so that's sort of about who whose law is<br>good for<br>who would appear it would appeal to<br>and where they might like to end up and<br>so thinking a little bit about laura at<br>otago<br>so the first year<br>is open entry<br>it's paper called laws 101<br>anybody<br>who wishes to can do it it's a four-year<br>paper<br>there's two<br>major exams at the end of the year<br>and it's broken into sort of four i<br>don't want to use the word modules<br>because that sounds as though they're<br>quite sequential because it's all a bit<br>more interwoven than that but there are<br>four<br>strong components<br>we talk about what law in the community<br>what lawyers are<br>what do they do<br>and start to introduce some of the sort<br>of basic ethical and professional ideas<br>about what being a lawyer is about being<br>honest and<br>how one deals with<br>people and respect and all those kind of<br>basic important ideas<br>and then another important strand is<br>what we describe as origins of<br>government<br>how did our law and government come to<br>be the way it is<br>and we often think in the law about<br>two strands of law in our terrorist new<br>zealand<br>one we commonly refer to as cox law the<br>law that came from<br>england to here and cupe's law the law<br>that was here existing at the time and<br>at the moment we're on a sort of an<br>exciting journey of thinking about how<br>those true strands of law<br>interact and work and so studying law in<br>the next five years<br>is really an interesting time to be<br>engaged in niche because it's partly<br>this realization of what doesn't mean<br>the legal system of arterial new zealand<br>and recognizing those two strands there<br>was a lot of work going on<br>in our teaching programs particularly<br>around that<br>the third bit is statutory<br>interpretation those statutes that some<br>of you are probably vaguely familiar<br>with you know the education action<br>i dare to say the crimes act um a whole<br>lot of statutes that parliament enacts<br>and words are inherently<br>ambiguous<br>and i often use with students and i<br>think it's helpful with any audience<br>this example for those of you who've<br>been to london you'll remember<br>those if you haven't you've probably<br>seen it in movies and books signs at the<br>top that say dogs must be carried on the<br>escalator<br>and when you first read that you thought<br>that's obvious<br>if i've got a dog<br>i need to pick it up and carry it<br>but if you think about it again it's<br>actually ambiguous<br>doesn't mean that<br>dogs must are you to go down the<br>escalator you ought to have a dog with<br>you<br>so what seems<br>pretty obvious to start with when you<br>start to pick at the language and think<br>more deeply about it<br>it's actually<br>always has some ambiguities around it<br>and so statutory interpretation is the<br>technique<br>within the law for dealing with that in<br>a principle and organized way about<br>reading language and understanding what<br>parliament really really meant<br>and then the other strand of law is<br>developed by the courts and what are<br>called cases for obvious particular<br>litigation between<br>parties<br>and the law evolves out of those<br>decisions that the courses that the<br>courts make so we spend quite a little<br>bit of time learning about how to<br>understand that<br>so laws 101<br>a big and interesting paper there are<br>lectures every week and there are<br>tutorials every week where people<br>practice the skills that we<br>are teaching taught by an exciting team<br>of six of my colleagues<br>laws 101 can be credited towards<br>virtually any other course of study at<br>otago so if you decide as a student on<br>law is not really for me<br>um<br>that's not a wasted not a wasted paper<br>we're particularly recommending at the<br>moment that students consider doing<br>maori 102 muddy society or some paper<br>from from tatumu to sort of buttress<br>that side of their knowledge it's<br>it it's not a requirement<br>but it's a um<br>a suggestion that that would be pretty<br>good thing to think about<br>ultimately you have to do six papers<br>from some other degree<br>most students would do five the minimum<br>you can do is four and many students do<br>so so that's a matter of sort of<br>crafting with course advisors a<br>particular program for<br>a particular student<br>beyond first year<br>so anybody can do laws 101<br>entry to second year is competitive<br>so there are about i i say here roughly<br>550 to 600 doing first year<br>and then we<br>take into a second year program between<br>250 and 260 and you know these are not<br>precise numbers we're not funded in the<br>way that medical studies are so that<br>the number so you know if we end up with<br>257<br>people<br>ending on a mark and then<br>the cup mark is is<br>um not quite so rigid so we have a bit<br>of<br>i don't want to say regular room but the<br>numbers vary a bit<br>so<br>we go from you know say 600 580 whatever<br>down to somewhere between 250 and 216.<br>normally required to get about a b plus<br>in laws 101<br>and the requirement is it must be a b<br>minus average in the best four of the<br>papers<br>now 93 percent roughly of our students<br>probably the most common is the ba<br>followed closely by the b com there's a<br>lot and then there are a large number of<br>bsc students<br>bachelor of music bachelor of performing<br>arts in fact one of the principal<br>organizers of that adventure children<br>back at the beginning the bachelor of<br>performing arts and i noticed at<br>graduation on<br>on saturday there are a number of people<br>with bachelor of applied science as well<br>with law<br>and that means that you can sort of take<br>your law degree beyond law out into<br>those things that interest you so you<br>might be interested in finance we might<br>be interested in chemistry or anatomy or<br>music or<br>theater studies<br>and so you can do that together either<br>that can be sort of something you do for<br>interest<br>or just to you know<br>take that great learning experience that<br>university provides and it may lead to<br>the kind of<br>law that you want to<br>go to so i mean i end up teaching a lot<br>of llb bcom students because taxation<br>and the other things i teach are<br>primarily focused<br>focused they're not exclusively but i<br>would teach a lot of you know<br>bcom students who are also interested in<br>business<br>so<br>that<br>double degree is is the dominant there<br>are about seven percent of people decide<br>they'll do four years and do and do an<br>llb and be getting on with it and<br>they do really well as well<br>so what do otago law students do well<br>one of the things we have is a bunch of<br>really<br>active student organizations and i think<br>everybody around the university would<br>say which are the most active student<br>organizations and they'd probably almost<br>say or exclusively say the law students<br>association<br>most of our students come from outside<br>dunedin so that means that they are<br>participants in that otago residential<br>experience<br>and the student organizations support<br>them along with all the other university<br>of otago structures and processes in<br>that in that journey<br>and<br>so there's one large organization called<br>souls which has been going for<br>80 or something years<br>um and it is an umbrella organization to<br>which all law students<br>can join and very many of them do they<br>do that range of sort of normal stuff<br>you would expect to see student groups<br>doing social events wellness programs<br>mentoring programs<br>um and they run those student<br>competitions where people practice legal<br>skills they're also heavily involved in<br>volunteering<br>there's a community law center in otago<br>that many of our students work at it's<br>the nakahumari law center where a number<br>of students also do voluntary work and<br>they're also involved in relay for life<br>and such like<br>to ruprify pataki is celebrating its<br>30th anniversary next year<br>and it has similar academic and social<br>occasions and events and connections for<br>maori students about 16 percent of our<br>students are<br>maori and i went to maori pre-grad on<br>friday which was<br>before<br>before grade on saturday<br>and<br>almost without exception the<br>number of students maori students who<br>are graduating there said i came from<br>the far north or i came from the east<br>coast and to rupa pataki<br>was my whanau that was the place where i<br>was<br>found my connections and my friends<br>and so terupify pachakism is<br>particularly<br>vital and important organization as are<br>the others so we have another four<br>a similar kind of function<br>by uh by pilsa pacific island law<br>students association<br>again this important<br>connection for students particularly<br>students who are far away from home and<br>from their communities<br>two more recent student organizations<br>the loss asian law students founded in<br>2019<br>pilsa the pride pulsar pila i should say<br>that's a mistake there pillow pride in<br>laura chargo<br>which is for students in the rainbow<br>community and they're doing an awful lot<br>of interesting work and engaging with<br>lawyers in the rainbow community about<br>about career development and such like<br>and then there's a more sort of a<br>broader group who<br>are involved in what they call<br>law for change we have a new group just<br>sort of embryonic starting called delos<br>or pilo and dilo which is for disabled<br>students and law and it's just getting<br>going in the last couple of months<br>do some other sorts of things for for<br>their community as they identify that<br>community<br>so what are otago law's points of<br>difference and i think as i said to you<br>at the beginning<br>um you can do law at six universities<br>throughout new zealand what is different<br>and special about us and it is a sense<br>of community<br>we have a smaller student cohort than<br>many of the others<br>and we work hard to connect that group<br>on on saturday one of the graduation<br>addresses was given by sir ian taylor<br>and he said he told his team that he did<br>not want to hear the word covert<br>and challenge in the same sentence so<br>i'm going to take that on board as well<br>covent has enabled us to think<br>differently and be innovative in how we<br>connect students we haven't been able to<br>do the many of the things that we used<br>to do<br>and particularly organized by souls and<br>pilser and pilo and oh elsa there's been<br>lots of virtual events and small events<br>rather than the big connections but we<br>still are able to do the same things<br>somewhat differently<br>and then academically the thing that is<br>completely different about laura otago<br>from any of the other five<br>our second year law program is taught<br>via immersion<br>there are four papers that you have to<br>do and you have to do them in that year<br>so you do criminal law public law<br>property law and contract law<br>now those four spread the sort of<br>general panoply of what law does i mean<br>law is about<br>it's private law but people making<br>contracts with each other<br>about owning property and selling<br>property and sharing property and such<br>like<br>a criminal law which obviously<br>affects many many people and whether<br>you're<br>you know whichever side of the ledger<br>you're on<br>and public law about how government<br>works how our constitution works so<br>that's<br>really it's not all of law but it's a<br>very broad spectrum of what law is about<br>and so will you do those four papers<br>only those four papers nothing else<br>and the whole program is designed as<br>immersion into legal thinking and method<br>and methodology while engaging in<br>subject knowledge across a pretty broad<br>range<br>so that second year program is where you<br>learn to think like a lawyer<br>it's unique to otago<br>and this is not saying that you don't<br>end up thinking like a lawyer when you<br>come out with an auckland degree but you<br>do it in a different way at otago and we<br>have<br>we revisited this about three years ago<br>and are totally committed to this<br>immersion way it helps us create this<br>community<br>and be it helps us get students with<br>their skills<br>early on<br>beyond that there's a choice of subjects<br>that you can study we have a very broad<br>range i mean you can do taxation with me<br>with new paper next year called law and<br>language<br>international law environmental law<br>commercial law<br>family property<br>um<br>bill of rights and some of those people<br>that you will see familiar from the<br>media like andrew giddis teaches about<br>the kind of things that you'll hear i'm<br>talking about on national radio just<br>since<br>talks about the things that you'll hear<br>her talking about on national radio<br>so we have a whole broad range beyond<br>that sort of core that we that we<br>immerse them in to begin with<br>we have a very strong and respected<br>degree recognition that's been going for<br>150 years we have<br>students all around the world as you saw<br>in that little snippet i gave you<br>the dean of law at oxford is an otago<br>graduate one of the leading<br>juris prudential legal thinkers he's<br>based in new york in the world is um<br>there's no charge graduate so otago<br>graduates<br>take their otago law degree and do great<br>things in this country but great things<br>around the world and it leverages into<br>and off i suppose<br>what is their special otago thing is<br>this residential learning community and<br>i have a suspicion that that might be my<br>last and it is so i can<br>stop the share and i have no idea how<br>time went<br>um i haven't heard the bell yet so i<br>kind of gone too far over time well you<br>didn't you did great shelly we've got<br>one question in the chat and um thanks<br>so much i also saw some of my friends in<br>the in the slides you've heard george<br>moorhead being one of them um so we have<br>one question here about the slideshow<br>percentages related to graduate outcomes<br>uh half of those employed practicing law<br>or a half as or is that percentage half<br>of all graduates going into the<br>workforce i think i'm interpreting that<br>right so half of<br>half of law graduates are in<br>the practice of law in its broader sense<br>i mean this is a pretty rough statistic<br>but half are in the practice of law they<br>might work for<br>a and b<br>solicitors<br>the other half are working for the<br>commerce commission the ministry of<br>justice<br>um telecom<br>anz bank<br>blahblah<br>an ewe authority whatever so i hope that<br>sort of explains it<br>doesn't mean that those who are working<br>at<br>a bank or working at the commerce<br>commission aren't doing law<br>but they're not doing<br>what we would traditionally call the<br>practice of law the law the lawyer you<br>go to see if you want to buy a house or<br>the lawyer you want to go to see if<br>you're separated from your your partner<br>or something and there's so many skills<br>as someone not biased that just had a<br>really great experience um that came<br>through so many skills you learn<br>practicing that law degree that are<br>transferable to so many industries as<br>well yeah which we can see by what<br>you're doing<br>yes<br>oppose the child for us<br>oh well<br>i'll put you up next year on my on my<br>little oh i would like that<br>that's my goal<br>thank you so much shelley um are there<br>any other questions we have maybe one or<br>two minutes very quickly if there

bye<br>all right so up next we have associate<br>professor marcel dawson who is the head<br>of program for sociology gender studies<br>and criminology so she is here to<br>present to us um and something that in<br>my research i saw that she's done a lot<br>of research in<br>social transformation or the particular<br>interests and alternatives to capitalism<br>so really excited for your corridor here<br>today myself<br>oh great thank you so much amber<br>timokoto katoa um it's lovely to see<br>some familiar faces project project i<br>think we've seen each other over the<br>years so lovely to see you there um<br>thanks so much for this opportunity to<br>speak to all of you about the value of<br>our degrees for<br>the future employment of our young<br>people<br>so as you will have heard amber say my<br>department covers three areas so that's<br>sociology<br>gender studies and criminology<br>now before i talk about each of these<br>wings of our department i thought i'd<br>begin with some of the key questions<br>that we get from students and also<br>sometimes from<br>from their parents<br>and one of the most obvious things and i<br>think probably relevant to<br>this discussion today is what kind of<br>work will i end up doing with a degree<br>in sociology gender studies and and<br>criminology<br>and i often say to students it's not one<br>of those sort of direct pathways when<br>you come to otago and you study<br>dentistry you've probably got a pretty<br>fixed idea in your mind of what you want<br>to do as a career and it's not really<br>the case with um with our degrees in<br>sociology gender studies and criminology<br>but as shirley spoke about just before<br>it really is about transferable skills<br>um so for us i think those three areas<br>work quite well on their own but they're<br>even better<br>when you combine them so sociology<br>gender studies and criminology and they<br>work really well in employment that is<br>focused on social justice social<br>equality and the overall betterment of<br>society<br>so i often say to students if you want<br>to make aotearoa a better place to live<br>in and if you want to make the world a<br>better place to be in then definitely<br>take sociology gender studies and<br>criminology<br>one of the other questions that often<br>comes up from our prospective students<br>or our school leavers<br>um is what kind of subjects can we take<br>in your department<br>um<br>now i'm not really going to have time in<br>this presentation to go into each of the<br>papers that we teach but that<br>information is available on you know in<br>the curriculum guides and on the website<br>so there's a lot of papers that we teach<br>from first year all the way through to<br>postgraduate but many of our students<br>choose to major either in sociology or<br>in gender studies and it's even possible<br>to do double major in those two subjects<br>we also have students who simultaneously<br>pursue a minor in criminology<br>and then when we tell students that they<br>sort of worry that they're going to get<br>locked in so they don't want to you know<br>only work in our department so often the<br>follow-up question will be can i do<br>other things on campus and a major<br>advantage of pursuing an otago arts<br>degree<br>is that you can choose from a wide range<br>of courses within and beyond the<br>humanities division<br>so we offer a lot of flexibility in<br>terms of how students put their degrees<br>together<br>so even if they take majors and minors<br>with us<br>they're not locked into a rigid<br>curriculum in our department only so<br>many of our students take<br>psychology politics anthropology<br>languages and even sport related<br>subjects<br>because if you think about it looking at<br>society through the lens of sport can<br>tell us quite a lot about equality and<br>justice<br>so some of our interests some of our<br>students sorry have an interest in<br>transgender athletes<br>they look at inequities in women's sport<br>and as uh shelley was saying earlier<br>um uh that the law students often take<br>our criminology paper<br>so so many of you see amber nodding<br>again so it might be you know that in in<br>your law degree you take um<br>crim sorry associate 103 so that's a<br>first-year introductory paper and it<br>pairs really well with a law degree so<br>if you're taking a degree in sociology<br>gender studies and criminology it really<br>does open up a world of opportunities<br>across campus<br>we've also got<br>students who do<br>health sciences<br>and many of them have to do a paper<br>outside of the<br>outside of health sciences and a lot of<br>the end up taking<br>uh papers in sociology and gender<br>studies and it gives them that sort of<br>balance so they're not only working in<br>health and medicine but they get to<br>understand people<br>because a disease doesn't just come into<br>a doctor's room on its own it comes in<br>on a person and that person is embedded<br>in a community and so to be able to<br>understand the community i think is<br>really important for for our health<br>science students<br>so now i want to move on and talk about<br>each of the three broad disciplines and<br>where<br>those areas can take young people in<br>terms of employment<br>i'll begin with criminology so we offer<br>that only at this stage is that adam is<br>a minor at otago<br>as a subject it gives us insights<br>insights into<br>the social factors that shape criminal<br>behavior<br>so instead of focusing on the individual<br>who has committed a crime and examining<br>their unique psychological features we<br>would rather focus on the complex social<br>circumstances that shape people's lives<br>so we might look for instance at<br>educational opportunities or family<br>circumstances or<br>where people live where they can afford<br>to live and we ask questions about their<br>life chances so what kinds of choices do<br>people have what kinds of opportunities<br>have they had in life and then we try to<br>arrive at<br>reasonable explanations for why people<br>might engage in certain kinds of<br>criminal activity<br>and the logic around this is<br>is that<br>if we are better able to understand the<br>root of the problem<br>we're better prepared than to work out a<br>solution rather than trying to fix the<br>person<br>um because often<br>the the person who is engaging in<br>criminal behaviors and is an outcome or<br>manifestation of much deeper lying<br>social problems so as criminologists we<br>really encourage students to look at the<br>fabric of society and ask those bigger<br>structural questions<br>um<br>in terms of employment with the<br>criminology degree many of our students<br>pursue careers with the police<br>in fact one of our former students<br>applied for a job with the police<br>and submitted an essay that he did for a<br>course that i was teaching on social<br>movements and protest<br>and the essay focused on the policing of<br>protest<br>and in fact it wasn't all that<br>flattering about the police he spoke<br>about police brutality and uh he thought<br>well he's just going to go for it he's<br>going to submit that as part of his<br>application<br>and he ended up working as an<br>intelligence analyst with the police<br>other criminology graduates have gone on<br>to take up jobs in corrections<br>so they've got involved in<br>rehabilitation or prison education<br>programs<br>we've also got students who've paired<br>the criminology degree with<br>papers in social and community work and<br>they might be drawn to careers in<br>organizations like community care trust<br>or auranga tamariki<br>or doing work that is related to victim<br>support<br>so as i said in the beginning<br>criminology as a minor pairs quite well<br>with a major in sociology<br>and also gender studies i'll deal with<br>sociology first um<br>you know as student leaders might have<br>done social studies at school and so if<br>they're interested in social studies<br>they probably would have an interest in<br>sociology<br>um but what we do at university is quite<br>different from what uh the school<br>curriculum entails because we go further<br>than looking at cultural diversity and<br>rights and responsibilities as citizens<br>we ask some very key questions about<br>power and equality<br>who has power how do they come to have<br>that power<br>can the power be challenged or disrupted<br>in any way<br>um<br>we also get into<br>some topics that students find quite<br>awkward for example race it's one of<br>those things none of our students ever<br>wants to talk about um because they're<br>terrified if they say anything it's<br>going to offend somebody<br>and um i'll never forget that just in<br>fact i'll read it out because it was<br>such a great comment from one of our<br>graduates who said<br>sociology helped me to understand race<br>so that it wasn't so weird to talk about<br>it i was always worried that by raising<br>the issue of race people would think i<br>was racist so i stayed silent<br>but now i know that as a society if we<br>want an anti-racist future<br>then we need to know how to talk about<br>race<br>and i think that's such a great thing<br>because uh i can sort of see students<br>shying away from it and know like you<br>know they sort of do the darting of the<br>eyes nobody wants to do a direct eye<br>contact um<br>but actually what you what we develop<br>with sociology is a language that<br>enables you to talk<br>confidently<br>about authority issues like race<br>of course we don't only look at race we<br>ask questions about how different<br>aspects of our identities cross cut<br>one another<br>such that different people<br>might experience the exact same<br>phenomenon or incident in society in<br>entirely different ways<br>for instance if we look at the covert<br>lockdowns<br>some people loved lockdown<br>some people absolutely hated it<br>and you kind of go but it's the same<br>thing the same thing for you know the<br>team of five million and so we ask<br>really pressing questions about you know<br>a person's life circumstances some of us<br>were able to transfer seamlessly into<br>work from our homes our homes are set up<br>in a way that enables working from home<br>so that has to do with social class it<br>has to do with employment others have<br>casual work so they weren't able to work<br>and therefore lost money they lost<br>connections with people so we ask those<br>kinds of questions<br>ultimately sociology<br>is interested in making the familiar<br>strange so if we sort of look at our<br>very ordinary everyday behavior<br>we sort of step outside ourselves and<br>ask questions about<br>why is it like that how did we get to<br>this situation and we piece together the<br>evidence until we can offer an accurate<br>explanation for what is going on around<br>us<br>in terms of jobs with a sociology degree<br>um<br>i mean i'll start with the skills first<br>our students gain cultural competence<br>they are trained to think critically<br>systematically and analytically and to<br>communicate clearly and effectively<br>and importantly with empathy<br>many of our sociology graduates end up<br>working for government agencies<br>ministries in particular recently we had<br>a former sociology graduate who worked<br>as a policy analyst<br>for the child and youth policy team at<br>the ministry of social development she's<br>currently working as a policy analyst<br>for the department of internal affairs<br>so again this idea of the transferable<br>skills is quite important she started<br>off in one place um and once she had a<br>foot in the door was able to move across<br>to different ministries but still doing<br>that work uh around policy analyzing<br>policy<br>and writing up research reports<br>um our graduate skills are also also<br>highly sought after in non-governmental<br>organizations so we've got quite a few<br>students working for the red cross<br>doing work with refugees different kinds<br>of work sometimes it's around<br>housing and accommodation other times<br>it's around<br>putting refugees in touch with other<br>support agencies uh finding employment<br>et cetera<br>our graduates have also worked in<br>research consultancies so there's litmus<br>up in wellington<br>that does social and economic research<br>also independent research solutions in<br>christchurch which is run by the<br>sociologist jared gilbert who some of<br>you might know as the person who talks<br>about gangs um they're currently doing a<br>research project into<br>the radicalization amongst alt-right<br>communities in new zealand so these are<br>just some of these sort of exciting<br>opportunities that a degree in sociology<br>opens up<br>and then i'll turn to our gender studies<br>program otago is one of the only gender<br>studies programs in new zealand so this<br>is really quite a draw card for us many<br>other universities have slowly gotten<br>rid of the women's studies and gender<br>studies it's not that they don't teach<br>it but at otago we've got a particular<br>named focus on gender studies it is a<br>very interdisciplinary qualification<br>that's why a lot of our students like it<br>we regularly have students who have an<br>interest in literature or politics human<br>geography philosophy education history<br>enrolling for a major or a minor in<br>gender studies<br>now this might be too soon for some of<br>our school leavers but we've got a phd<br>student<br>who's currently looking at tomboyism and<br>how it is represented in literature<br>other students have combined their<br>interests in<br>criminology and gender to can study<br>sorry to consider<br>the plight of uh transgender people in<br>prison so with those skills we can<br>consider really topical<br>uh<br>critical issues for for our terror with<br>uh the combination of those subjects<br>in terms of jobs with the gender studies<br>degree<br>we have had students um working for<br>youthline so one of our recent graduates<br>was a funding and communications<br>coordinator for youthline<br>we've had other students who have in<br>fact created jobs<br>for themselves around their skills so we<br>had a student i can't remember exactly<br>what organization she was working for<br>but she did her gender studies at otago<br>and<br>basically devised a role for herself in<br>that same company as an equity officer<br>so just by being there she could see<br>that um you know the the organization<br>was terribly imbalanced in terms of<br>gender equity and she relied on her<br>skills to to make the job for herself<br>um so what you'll find<br>you know when when students are asking<br>about career advice is very rarely will<br>an employer be looking<br>for somebody with a sociology or gender<br>studies qualification the focus<br>will generally be on the skills rather<br>than the name of the qualification<br>so<br>um<br>you know once our students are leaving<br>university and they're looking for jobs<br>they might come across an advert for an<br>end from an ngo<br>looking for a project leader<br>but then they'll specify that they're<br>looking for somebody who is able to<br>conduct a systematic literature review<br>or undertake empirical research analyze<br>data<br>write and communicate clearly and<br>effectively and these are precisely the<br>skills that young people will acquire if<br>they do a degree<br>with us<br>so really it's that idea of taking those<br>skills and working them into a job<br>rather than looking out for jobs that<br>are advertising or looking for a degree<br>in sociology because you will students<br>will very rarely find that and i think<br>that's what gives rise to the<br>misconception that there aren't any<br>degrees i'm sorry there aren't any jobs<br>for our graduates most of our graduates<br>find employment<br>but they didn't find it by answering a<br>call for a job that was looking for a<br>sociologist or somebody with gender<br>studies<br>one thing that i will say that we do<br>exceptionally well at otago is that we<br>make ourselves available to students<br>there's many universities where you can<br>study all of these<br>subjects but over the years we've had<br>students transferring from universities<br>in the north island<br>uh and something that often comes up is<br>that they like how accessible the<br>lecturers are in our department so um i<br>would say to the school leavers that if<br>if they're interested in questions<br>around identity human relationships<br>power and social justice and if they<br>want to be directly supported by the<br>teaching staff in their learning journey<br>then they should definitely come and<br>study<br>sociology gender studies and criminology<br>in our department here at the university<br>that was a beautiful way to wrap that up<br>marcel and<br>before coming to the liaison team i was<br>working in the colleges and they were<br>always really grateful for being able to<br>go and drop it and see the sociology<br>teaching stuff in particular so it's<br>great<br>we do have maybe one or two minutes if<br>there's any burning questions<br>there's nothing in the chat at the<br>moment but if anyone wants to get their<br>fingers flying um you could pop<br>something in there so that we could<br>either answer it ourselves or pass it<br>over<br>we should just move to a great thing<br>i'll just jump in here cheryl thank you<br>to everyone uh therese lamb here i just<br>wanted to say and extend a warm thank<br>you to<br>myself for your lovely talk um it was<br>really good to hear you talk about those<br>options criminology sociology gender<br>studies i'm sure we can all agree in the<br>school's liaison team we get lots of<br>students<br>who are interested in these topics<br>sometimes the parents do question<br>because they don't know too much about<br>them<br>and i'm thinking gender studies in<br>particular but in saying that i love how<br>you focused on the fact that it's the<br>skills that they gained from these<br>courses and these programs um and what<br>they and where they can actually go<br>there's a whole range of opportunities<br>um<br>not just you know<br>just thinking broadly so ngos police and<br>and focusing on that thing that you said<br>about<br>um wanting to make this world a better<br>place focusing on social justice i think<br>really good points um that we will all<br>take away from your talk so thank you<br>for your time and i'll just touch on i<br>believe we um<br>sorry shelley griffith has probably left<br>us but also just want to thank her for<br>her time talking about law<br>that was a nice combination talking<br>about criminology and law together there<br>and focusing on our law school being<br>that close-knit community<br>um and her line of community and<br>excellence<br>study as well as thinking about those<br>students who have a curious mind so um<br>yeah so i'll leave it<br>there and thank you for your time and i<br>believe we're moving into<br>a break or a kahoot can i just<br>it's a break a break okay so everyone<br>feel free to go have a break and we'll<br>around 11 15.<br>11 o'clock on the dot and we have a<br>surprise and some fun and then we'll<br>jump into our commerce speakers at 11</p></main><footer
