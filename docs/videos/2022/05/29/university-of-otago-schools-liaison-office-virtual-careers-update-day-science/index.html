little<br>bit i'm my the room i'm at is right next<br>to my deck and the sun's actually<br>shining so that's really awesome<br>it's my pleasure to move into the<br>science part of today's program<br>and i'd like to introduce associate<br>professor michael jack are you there<br>michael<br>yeah i'm here awesome so michael started<br>off in physics<br>and uh his and then became interested in<br>climate change sustainable energy<br>renewables and those sorts of matters so<br>that's moved his career in a different<br>direction and he's going to speak to us<br>about his work and the opportunities<br>available for students at otago welcome<br>along michael<br>okay thanks a lot kyoto koto everyone um<br>nice to um<br>see those of you um that i've spoken to<br>before um<br>and um<br>hello to those who i haven't<br>talked to before so i hope um<br>um<br>i'm not gonna be repeating too much of<br>um what i've um i've told you before<br>because i know i have talked to some of<br>you<br>um<br>so um<br>maybe the best thing to do is to make<br>this quite an interactive um<br>session where you you ask me questions<br>etc um along the way um<br>and we do do things that way um can you<br>see my screen okay<br>okay so oh<br>can you just see the presentation or can<br>you see my whole screen because i'm not<br>sure i did that right<br>we can just see your presentation it<br>looks good<br>okay great<br>um yeah so my name's michael jack i'm<br>the director of the energy program<br>here at otago<br>um i've been here since about 2015.<br>um so i wanted to um<br>tell you a little bit about our about<br>our program um<br>what what what we teach as part of our<br>program um<br>a little<br>discussion about some of the research we<br>do um the the people who are<br>interested in energy research at otago<br>what we do<br>and then i kind of wanted to go through<br>some of the profiles of some of our<br>students because i think that will give<br>you a really good idea of<br>um<br>of who they are and what they end up<br>doing um and and then um you know a good<br>idea of of how to um<br>to see what students are suitable for<br>this this program<br>does that sound like a good um plan<br>sounds perfect<br>okay great<br>so<br>um so we've got a a pretty unique<br>program i i i'm<br>i say that with um a little bit of<br>hesitation because a number of um<br>we've been going for a long time and a<br>number of organizations have started to<br>develop programs into this in in this<br>area and so it's starting i'm less and<br>less able to say we have a unique<br>program<br>but what we try to do in our program is<br>we cover the science behind<br>renewable energy technologies and energy<br>efficiency<br>so we we cover this the technical and<br>scientific aspects of those<br>those areas and and also how they fit in<br>with<br>climate change and reducing carbon<br>emissions<br>and um<br>the the point of of what we do is it's<br>very energy focused um so as opposed to<br>say an engineering degree that<br>may look at mechanical engineering or a<br>chemical process engineer engineering<br>degree that is that is um is looks at<br>the chemical side of things<br>our degree<br>kind of covers all the parts of those<br>degrees that focus on energy so<br>um um that's that's just the focus of<br>what we do<br>um we have a long history and an<br>excellent reputation in the sector and<br>i'll show you some examples of um<br>students that are kind of out in the<br>sector um<br>doing great things<br>we've we've developed this reputation<br>over the years for producing graduates<br>that are really<br>quite<br>um so one of the reasons why our um our<br>degree is becoming more and more popular<br>is because we<br>we developed the skills and the<br>knowledge<br>for students to reduce<br>energy related greenhouse gas emissions<br>so there's greenhouse gas emissions<br>associated with um<br>methane and agriculture that's not<br>something we address but we address all<br>those um uh greenhouse gases that are<br>energy related so<br>that's why our students<br>are in such demand and i'll talk more<br>and and and i guess there's there's this<br>um<br>stronger and stronger drive from<br>students with an interest in<br>environment in the environment and<br>climate change<br>and you know we saw that with a number<br>of the student protests that<br>that happened<br>pre-covered<br>um so we often get these students<br>coming to our program<br>because of their interest in<br>environmental issues<br>one of our requirements is because we've<br>got quite a technical program we require<br>students to be good at mathematics and<br>physics so<br>when i say good i guess i don't mean<br>amazing<br>they can be competent and do our program<br>that's that's kind of what um what we<br>require so it's it our program requires<br>a bunch of other skills but we do<br>require that sort of basis in<br>mathematics<br>um they often come in as i said they<br>have this interest in the environment um<br>and climate change um and or renewable<br>energy some of them are coming in and<br>they've already focused on renewable<br>energy and that's what they're they're<br>interested in so the combination of<br>those two things um good at mathematics<br>and physics or competent in mathematics<br>and physics and interested in the<br>environment<br>is are really good fits for our<br>our program<br>um one of the other things i just want<br>to emphasize is that often our students<br>the the<br>the profile of our students are they're<br>interested in applications um rather<br>than the pure science um aspect of<br>things so<br>we i'd compare this with physics majors<br>who often are interested in um in the<br>pure science aspect of physics so our<br>students are very similar to engineering<br>majors in that sense they're interested<br>um<br>we<br>have a very flexible first year and this<br>i think this is very important because<br>students<br>all the students i see they they come in<br>and they often<br>don't know what they want to do with<br>their lives<br>and they're often choosing subjects<br>because um<br>of um<br>that they learnt the subject in high<br>school and liked it there it's often<br>very different at university and there's<br>a whole range of<br>areas that aren't part of the high<br>school curriculum that they really don't<br>know about<br>and so um this this idea of flexible<br>first year is really important so the<br>core first year papers for our course um<br>are<br>two<br>first year math courses and two physics<br>um<br>first year physics courses you don't<br>have to do<br>both of those physics<br>courses to<br>to enter our program you only have to do<br>doing those<br>those subjects provides this excellent<br>foundation for a whole bunch of<br>kind of engineering related subjects um<br>so for example<br>engineering first year at canterbury so<br>we have a lot of students<br>who are doing an engineering first year<br>here at otago and then they go on to<br>engineering school at canterbury and<br>they take those those<br>courses<br>three of the above papers are<br>recommended<br>as part of surveying<br>um physics of course they can go on to<br>physics if they<br>decide that's what sort of interest and<br>do a physics major or they can have a<br>look at the energy focused degrees okay<br>and we have two of those and one is a<br>bachelor of applied science and energy<br>management which is a three plus one<br>degree where you can do<br>three years of<br>undergraduate and then<br>of your bachelor applied science and<br>then<br>another year of honours<br>and a bsc in energy science and<br>technology<br>um we're quite so so that so the<br>difference between these two is is<br>reasonably minor there are there are<br>core papers that are<br>a key to both of those<br>and<br>we let<br>students if they want to<br>swap between the two depending on on how<br>how they want<br>how it fits with with where they're<br>heading with their careers um we often<br>get students who are coming in really<br>focused on<br>a career in energy management and<br>they'll go into the bachelor of applied<br>science<br>um<br>but most students are um are kind of not<br>really sure what they want to do and the<br>energy science and technology is a is a<br>kind of a flexible um<br>way in which they can they can start<br>getting a taste of energy<br>and then if they find they really like<br>it they can swap into the energy<br>management<br>um so the sort of things we cover in our<br>in our degree<br>um<br>we look at renewable energy resources um<br>so of course new zealand is blessed with<br>this huge range of of energy renewable<br>energy resources um<br>that the standard ones like like solar<br>pv<br>um<br>wind hydro<br>geothermal<br>but there's also a whole bunch of<br>resources that haven't been exploited<br>yet and such as<br>wave and and tidal which new zealand has<br>a lot of um and so there are new<br>technologies being developed in those<br>areas and we we help the students<br>learn to estimate the um<br>the energy content of all those<br>resources<br>the kind of core of what we do in our in<br>our course is is focused on<br>thermodynamics which is is really the<br>science of converting energy from one<br>form to another okay and as part of that<br>you learn about conversion technologies<br>and the efficiencies associated with<br>with those<br>technologies<br>we also think about things like end use<br>and energy efficiency so how to be more<br>efficient with the energy you use<br>um<br>energy systems you know how it all fits<br>together<br>and this go this can um<br>be at a small scale a micro scale up to<br>how does how does a whole country's<br>energy system fit together<br>uh we also cover environmental physics<br>so um the science behind climate change<br>and greenhouse gases and that's really<br>important for the students to understand<br>um that aspect of things<br>and because we have this quite technical<br>degree quite mathematical degree we um<br>a really important<br>thing that students learn is is problem<br>solving skills<br>and and as part of that<br>so i i<br>i thought um at this point i would i<br>would talk a little bit about some of<br>the research programs that we have um<br>um underway in the physics department<br>just to to to to show you that a lot<br>about teaching is is really underpinned<br>by um by active<br>so i'll talk first about<br>my colleagues work rather than my own so<br>my colleague is doing a lot of work on<br>energy efficiency<br>energy energy efficient technology<br>development so he's focused on things<br>like heat pumps dehumidifiers and heat<br>the science of<br>how nanoscale structures on on on<br>surfaces can interact with water so it's<br>really neat<br>stuff that<br>has a lot of<br>relation to biological<br>processes because<br>biology for example leafs the surface of<br>a leaf<br>is is designed in order to condense<br>water in a lot of cases or to have water<br>run off in a certain way and this<br>exactly the same type of kind of nano<br>micro structure is is useful for things<br>like dehumidifiers and heat exchangers<br>where you're trying to get water to<br>condense on a surface or not condense on<br>a surface and depending on on what your<br>application is so he's he's<br>trying to understand the real science of<br>how um how that works and how those<br>nanoscale structures um<br>interact um and applying those all the<br>way through to um<br>designing better dehumidifiers and heat<br>pumps and heat exchangers<br>my own work is<br>is much more focused on renewable energy<br>integration okay so i think very much<br>about<br>what's the future of um<br>of um<br>uh so so it's bigger picture stuff i<br>think about um what is the the future<br>energy system of new zealand going to<br>look like<br>how do we go about integrating more<br>renewable energy into our system<br>um into our energy system and so i think<br>a lot about um and one of the<br>difficulties with renewables is their<br>variability that they're they're varying<br>in time so the wind is blowing is not<br>blowing all the time the sun is not<br>shining all the time and that<br>variability makes<br>integrating those renewables into an<br>energy system difficult<br>and<br>a lot of what i think about is how could<br>you<br>um make our energy system more flexible<br>um<br>and um and and be able to deal with that<br>demand uh that that that that variable<br>supply sorry and so we have a supply of<br>energy and we have a demand for energy<br>and both of them are varying in time<br>and but there are ways in which we can<br>shift out the demand when we actually<br>want to use energy there are some things<br>that we do that that we don't need to do<br>when we do them we we just do it out of<br>um<br>basically not thinking or um or not<br>worrying about when we do them but if we<br>have things set on timers if we put<br>smart control on devices then we can<br>shift some of that demand into the<br>periods where there's a lot of renewable<br>supply so that's a lot of what i think<br>about i think about how<br>very high percentages of renewables and<br>we need to be much more smarter about<br>how we control our um our electricity um<br>uh grid especially<br>and so this is just a sort of a picture<br>to sort of illustrate what i'm talking<br>about so in the past we've we've always<br>thought of<br>um<br>electricity as flowing one way so coming<br>from a power station going through our<br>transmission lines and being consumed um<br>by commercial buildings uh commercial<br>businesses or residential consumers<br>right<br>however as the world is changing with a<br>lot more distributed energy generation<br>and um a lot more ways in which we can<br>use energy we need to rethink how our<br>electricity grid is is structured<br>and in the future it's much<br>more likely that but electricity grid is<br>this enabling thing which may allows us<br>to connect<br>these distributed energy resources like<br>solar pv wind etc<br>between<br>between neighbours between um<br>parts of the country rather than the<br>sort of centralized<br>structure we also need to think about<br>the future of electricity demand where<br>we've got electric vehicles um coming<br>which are<br>are going to put much more um alex<br>demands on the electricity grid we've<br>got<br>um energy efficient technologies we've<br>got things like smart appliances that<br>the the use can be shifted in time and<br>so we need to think about how those um<br>those um<br>those new things interact in this in<br>this future electricity grid so so these<br>are some of the things i think about<br>um and<br>the the key element is is really this<br>kind of idea of greater flexibility um<br>being able to deal with um<br>with that variability of renewables and<br>that variability of demand and using<br>things like batteries or or smart<br>control to shift um to shift demand to<br>when<br>we have we have plentiful renewable<br>supply so those are some of the things i<br>think about<br>okay so i kind of want to go back to our<br>students a little bit more um and and<br>kind of talk to you about<br>i guess where they end up and and<br>what industry think about um about these<br>these students<br>um<br>and basically i want to emphasize that<br>um there are there are really excellent<br>career prospects for our our students<br>the graduates are are really in high<br>demand um<br>so they they come out of their degree<br>whether it's a bsc a b um a bachelor a<br>bsc honours or a<br>bachelor of applied science honours<br>they<br>end up getting these really<br>interesting um<br>high-paying jobs very quickly<br>so they're thought of as<br>engineers with a with an<br>with an energy focus<br>so that's kind of<br>where they where they end up<br>getting their jobs<br>one of the really important things about<br>these students is that as i said they<br>have the skills and knowledge to reduce<br>greenhouse gas emissions so um the real<br>interest from coming from businesses um<br>government etc is around greenhouse gas<br>emissions<br>rather than energy per se but because<br>our students know how to<br>understand this connection between<br>energy and greenhouse gases they they<br>have those skills to reduce those<br>greenhouse gas emissions so a lot of<br>these companies<br>government organizations etc have put in<br>place these strategies where they want<br>to<br>reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by<br>80 percent or whatever get get um<br>to net zero um by 2030 but they don't<br>have the skills or the knowledge to<br>actually figure out how they're going to<br>do that or um on the ground and and<br>that's um those are the skills that our<br>students have you know what should we do<br>first um<br>you know how do we go about reducing<br>these greenhouse gas emissions um and<br>they can they can really make that that<br>difference<br>um and on top of that a lot of the what<br>they can do can save companies money<br>okay so if you're saving energy you can<br>often save money<br>um and so that's that's a really um<br>important part of why they're in in high<br>demand<br>um i also i kind of wanted to say<br>something about clean energy careers um<br>as a sort of a meaningful and fruit<br>future-proof um<br>uh career as well because<br>um you know i think this is one of the<br>reasons why um<br>you know it's a great a great thing for<br>young people to to be getting into<br>um and<br>um i think you know worldwide there's<br>there's been a number of publications<br>that have come out talking about this<br>um and here's just one of them<br>from the us you know they're talking<br>about the momentum of the world's clean<br>energy transition you know impossible to<br>ignore um<br>every country in the world has to go<br>through this transition to decarbonize<br>and um<br>we need people with the skills to be<br>able to to do that um<br>so i guess the the the<br>some of the key things about this is<br>that you know they require greater<br>scientific knowledge than your normal um<br>profession there's a lack of young<br>people entering these these jobs so<br>there's there's a lot of history of<br>um<br>of i guess people working in the energy<br>sector that um are<br>kind of getting on an age and and where<br>there's a need for the young talent to<br>come through<br>um and you know this there's um these<br>occupations um are high high paying and<br>um<br>often um<br>as i've found it um there's this very um<br>uh even distribution between male and<br>female um graduates that are that are<br>coming out and so as opposed to the the<br>um the past where a lot of these jobs<br>were um kind of very male dominated um<br>things have definitely changed once you<br>once you put a sustainability or a<br>carbon uh stamp on things um there are<br>many more um<br>female students who are entering these<br>jobs which you would<br>injure in these areas where you would<br>traditionally<br>consider them to be male dominated<br>and i'll show you some examples of that<br>um yeah so so now i i just<br>kind of want to go into<br>you know what do our graduates do who<br>are they um just so that you can get<br>this idea um<br>um and and so this is this is malia she<br>graduated with a bachelor of applied<br>science honours in 2018.<br>she got a graduate position at kiwi rail<br>and then<br>got appointed to a permanent role as<br>their energy and sustainability advisor<br>obviously<br>um a pacific background she<br>um she had this real um<br>passion for um doing something about<br>climate change and and<br>and so that was that was really her<br>driver but it's it's really interesting<br>these these um these<br>graduates who come out and how much<br>impact they can have on greenhouse gas<br>emissions so i just got some numbers<br>here that i wrote down<br>so in one in one initiative they had<br>um<br>that malia<br>progressed at kiwi rail<br>um they were able to reduce um<br>um 270<br>000 tons of co2 emissions<br>by um changing um the way their um their<br>trucks um<br>uh were managed so the way their truck<br>stops so they cut 1.1 million truck<br>and and just immediately reduce that<br>many tons of co2 but so so the point is<br>they're having this real impact out<br>there<br>i've got another graduate student here<br>that i wrote down<br>maddie mark who works at contact she's a<br>renewable energy project analysis now so<br>for her one project where they put in<br>the geothermal power plant that's 450<br>kilotons of co2 per year<br>just just like that<br>sophie's son she's an energy graduate at<br>silver fern farms um<br>and um the meat industry uses a lot of<br>coal they use about 226 kilo tons of co2<br>per year and silver fern farms goal is<br>to halve that by 2050 2025 sorry and and<br>sophie sun is right in the middle of<br>that so you know these these students<br>are just having a huge impact<br>um<br>sorry to interrupt you but um i'm just<br>kind of conscious of time yeah next<br>speaker is as british go okay so i i<br>find you absolutely fascinating you know<br>that i've heard you speak many times and<br>i think these graduate profiles are<br>awesome but also so um i'm sure karen<br>will have some wonderful plan where if<br>teachers and career advisors would like<br>to see some actual real live students<br>and what they're doing she can pass that<br>information on to them okay perfect<br>because<br>i'm sorry michael i was just going to<br>say sure i can do that and we've just<br>got one quick question<br>so you were saying it's good if your<br>students are coming from high school<br>competent and physics and maths does<br>that mean taking it to year 13.<br>um so so what they need to what they<br>need to be able to do is they need to be<br>able to pass<br>first-year university mathematics so<br>that<br>taking maths with calculus to year 13<br>really helps with that but<br>um um<br>a lot of students don't have year 13<br>maths and they still do fine at<br>university first year so university<br>first year is essentially<br>i would i would argue a repeat of year<br>13 in a way and so they can come in um<br>with with the level 2 but they just<br>will probably have to work a bit harder<br>awesome thank you and thank you so much<br>for your presentation and clap from<br>everyone um i especially loved hearing<br>about your smart<br>electricity grad oh my god that's just<br>the way we need to go in the future so<br>thank you very much i'm gonna hand over<br>to cheryl who's going to introduce our<br>next speaker okay sure cheryl um yeah<br>happy happy for you to share these um<br>these slides if you would like as well<br>so that's awesome thank you i love a<br>good picture i love a good diagram so a<br>bit of a sucker for it so in this job<br>i've become amazed at how much<br>i've come to understand some things that<br>are completely outside my realm of<br>experience just from a really good<br>explanation so thank you very much<br>so it's it's my pleasure now to<br>introduce um dr gaia and anna lingam now<br>i hope that's<br>you can correct me on your name<br>pronunciation um so guy did her um<br>masters at otago and then went on to do<br>a phd in the us having um won a<br>fulbright scholarship so some sort of<br>power as well that i think she maybe can<br>tell us a little bit more about she's<br>going to speak her topic today is on<br>aquaculture and fisheries so i would<br>like to introduce gaia and i'm very<br>interested to hear what she has to say<br>which we hope you're out there<br>yes i'm here thanks cheryl awesome hi<br>photographer i saw of you online you're<br>in this little wet suit you know on a<br>and then i read power so it's kind of<br>like yeah you know it sort of seemed<br>like yeah it was quite funny so yeah<br>it's it's not always very glamorous let<br>me show you<br>marine marine sciences is glamorous<br>sometimes it can be but quite often<br>you're miserable and cold and wet but<br>but i'll sell it in other ways let me<br>see<br>it's lovely to see you anyway thank you<br>for coming along and participating today<br>i'll give you the floor<br>no worries so i um i'll just introduce<br>myself first i guess so you did a good<br>job with my name there my name is guyana<br>lingam i'm a lecturer in the department<br>of marine science<br>and i work primarily in the aquaculture<br>and fisheries space so i work a lot<br>in fisheries restoration working with<br>species that people like to eat so<br>things like power<br>and colder or crayfish<br>and<br>i work a lot with communities as well so<br>a lot of the work that i do is uh<br>focused up in the east otago tayapuri so<br>just north north of dunedin and so we<br>have a relationship with the tangata<br>funeral there where we help support them<br>in the management of their fisheries by<br>providing some of the science that helps<br>them um the management of their um<br>decisions um and so i'm going to share<br>my screen now<br>and provide you i guess with a bit of a<br>a snapshot of what we do here<br>and if you have any questions by all<br>means please<br>stop me um and ask them so let me see if<br>um so can you see the presentation there<br>yeah it looks good thank you have fun<br>cool<br>um and so um agriculture and fisheries<br>um is based um within the department of<br>marine science um and here is a picture<br>here of myself and three of our students<br>conducting a power survey um in the east<br>ota east otago tapari<br>so<br>the question what is marine science well<br>many people think of<br>whales when they think about marine<br>science they'll think about the big<br>charismatic megafauna in and studying<br>those um if you ask some students they<br>might think to be a marine science means<br>that you are a dolphin trainer and work<br>in places like seaboard but um let me<br>assure you there is there is a lot more<br>to marine science than that so as well<br>as our big charismatic megafauna<br>we we look at a whole range of other<br>animals um flora and fauna and we look<br>at fish we look at invertebrates many of<br>which<br>make up our valuable fisheries and we<br>look at seaweeds they're our big<br>ecosystem engineers that help maintain a<br>healthy ecosystem<br>but aside from i guess the biology which<br>is sort of the natural assumption there<br>is a whole<br>range of other facets that come into<br>play as well so we're involved with<br>things like policy and law<br>history and culture more and more there<br>is an emphasis on<br>including indigenous knowledge or<br>mataranga maori in the work that we do<br>there is marine geology and so things<br>like sediments cause rocks and chemistry<br>all come into play within marine science<br>as well as oceanography<br>so things like<br>understanding waves tides currents and<br>fronts<br>these all these all come into play and<br>and it's very much<br>an interdisciplinary<br>program<br>it draws from a whole range of different<br>places and you can see sort of the range<br>of work um that takes place within the<br>department in those photos at the bottom<br>there we've got people diving and<br>measuring<br>power we've got people mapping the<br>benthic<br>environment and we've got people doing<br>laboratory work and looking at<br>um aquaculture and fisheries i suppose<br>is a subset of marine science um it is<br>particularly relevant um here in atiora<br>and new zealand has one of the largest<br>exclusive economic zones in the world<br>and<br>within the zone we do a lot of fishing<br>activity and fisheries commercial<br>fisheries are one of new zealand's<br>biggest export earners<br>and as such it is an important industry<br>and it's one that requires<br>people who understand the marine<br>environment<br>as well as commercial industry there are<br>significant<br>customary and recreational<br>values within the fisheries sector<br>and science plays an integral role in<br>management<br>policy development and technology that<br>is used<br>throughout<br>part of i guess the<br>appeal for many of our students<br>is the fact that our marine environment<br>is under<br>significant pressure there are<br>challenges that we will need to address<br>um as<br>a country<br>internationally<br>within the marine space that will<br>require<br>students and professionals who<br>understand the marine environment so<br>climate change in particular is one<br>that is going to affect the marine<br>environment in a number of ways i mean<br>for instance we're already experiencing<br>a significant<br>marine heat wave um this summer<br>down in southern new zealand and that's<br>having a huge impact on the marine<br>environment you might have seen reports<br>of<br>mass sponge bleaching in fiordland and<br>that's just you know one of the<br>indicators of a marine system that's not<br>quite<br>in balance and so<br>understanding fisheries is is going to<br>be um<br>a<br>a huge challenge for us um into the<br>future<br>and then aquaculture um is is a huge<br>growth industry so in new zealand um the<br>government is<br>looking to invest significantly in<br>aquaculture and they released the new<br>zealand government aquaculture strategy<br>in 2019 which sort of outlines<br>the pathway to<br>more agriculture development in new<br>zealand<br>we're looking i guess to push<br>current sort of exports up towards three<br>billion dollars<br>and growing growing um the<br>um this industry in a whole bunch of<br>different ways so not just focusing on i<br>guess traditional aquaculture um<br>things like salmon but leading into<br>other um other alternatives as well and<br>and species that we haven't grown before<br>so i should probably also say for some<br>of you who may not be familiar with what<br>aquaculture is it's essentially<br>marine farming um so taking species out<br>and growing them in the marine<br>environment or even on land so you can<br>have both<br>marine based aquaculture as well as<br>and so the aquaculture and fisheries<br>program<br>in<br>otago is i guess one<br>of the unique programs out there<br>in new zealand there<br>there are some aquaculture courses that<br>you can do at<br>polytechs but in terms of the university<br>there's nothing else that's sort of<br>really offered in this space um although<br>there are broader marine science<br>programs available elsewhere and we<br>really utilize<br>some of the facilities and resources at<br>the university so we have the portobello<br>marine lab which is based<br>out at portobello so it's off campus<br>about 40 minutes from the main campus in<br>dunedin and this is a space where we can<br>do a lot of our lab-based<br>work and you can see in these images<br>here students who are engaged in a fair<br>bit of research here we've got<br>down in the bottom left we've got one of<br>our researchers and student longley are<br>looking at outgrowing<br>kelp<br>for kelp restoration<br>we've got adam brooke here who is a<br>research assistant who is looking at<br>reseeding power so using power in a<br>aquaculture system to then restore<br>the environment as well and so the<br>portobello marine lab has<br>some great facilities available for<br>researchers and students<br>and we also have um the ability to do a<br>number of field based studies um so<br>diving is a huge component of what we do<br>and what a lot of students<br>like to train towards to be trained<br>towards to be able to do as well um so<br>there is um<br>i guess training opportunities for<br>diving and using that as a tool in<br>research<br>um the department also has four main um<br>vessels that are available for research<br>and teaching as well so the largest is<br>um the polaris two um which i think is a<br>21 meter vessel that can<br>that can go offshore and be unsupported<br>so you can live aboard<br>and do research and students even at an<br>undergraduate level get the opportunity<br>to go on board the polaris<br>and experience<br>scientific research off a vessel like<br>that<br>um<br>and then we also have some smaller<br>coastal vessels sort of six meter length<br>vessels that let us do<br>inshore work as well which the students<br>will get an opportunity to experience as<br>well even at an undergraduate level<br>and then most recently<br>because it's very recent i don't have<br>any images of it um we have just created<br>an aquaculture array um off the<br>portobello marine lab so this i guess is<br>a small scale aquaculture<br>setup that that students and researchers<br>will use to try and test different um<br>different forms of aquaculture grow out<br>so there's a student currently doing her<br>phd who's looking at multi-trophic<br>aquaculture so she's growing kelps she's<br>going to be putting some mussels out<br>there and she's going to look at the<br>interactions of all these species<br>together so<br>this array is going to be a<br>wonderful resource for us into the<br>future to explore some of the questions<br>so in terms of studying aquaculture and<br>fisheries at otago<br>there the<br>degree is a bachelor of applied science<br>in aquaculture and fisheries and it sort<br>of involves a range of different things<br>um<br>i'm sorry we're close to the hospital<br>here so if i get drowned out by the<br>helicopters coming in to land i<br>apologize but<br>yeah there's one just coming in right<br>now it's quite noisy um<br>and so the applied science degree it<br>involves<br>elements of biology ecology and human<br>impacts and husbandry we have people who<br>teach into the classes involved in food<br>science um involved in zoology um so the<br>so the contributors are quite broad and<br>it's quite a broad interdisciplinary um<br>degree<br>um in terms of what we<br>um in terms of<br>what students<br>should perhaps look into studying um<br>from from high school you'd sort of want<br>to focus on biology chemistry and a bit<br>and it's also important to note that for<br>this degree students must have a minor<br>or a second major in another subject so<br>things like business studies or food<br>science are quite often encouraged<br>because it really helps with the<br>aquaculture focus for example<br>i've also just put in there just as a<br>point of comparison and the bachelor of<br>science in marine science which i guess<br>is a broader degree and involves<br>all those other things that aren't<br>necessarily tied to aquaculture and<br>fisheries<br>this requires<br>biology chemistry with a bit of maths<br>again statistics or calculus and perhaps<br>physics particularly if you're<br>interested<br>in oceanography<br>and this is a new degree that's just<br>started in 2022 but builds on the<br>previous<br>bachelor's degree that was available<br>now there are minor and honours options<br>also available for aquaculture and<br>fisheries um and uh yeah you can look<br>so in terms of what you would do in a<br>sort of first year program um you can<br>see on the left hand side the types of<br>papers that a student would be required<br>to take<br>so things like animal biology marine<br>biology which is your 100 level sort of<br>basic introduction to life in the sea<br>basic statistics<br>and then the choice of three other<br>papers from a range of subjects so<br>things like botany molecular biology<br>chemistry and so on<br>um<br>and the the core classes um all come<br>with uh lectures workshop seminars and<br>field components and which is a great<br>way for students to get out and about<br>and actually sort of see how things<br>specific<br>aquaculture and fisheries papers um<br>they're sort of listed here so the three<br>main<br>classes that are taught in this degree<br>program the second year paper is called<br>principles of aquaculture so it's the<br>the<br>the introduction to aquaculture and for<br>students they get to go visit um<br>aquaculture facilities down in rocky oro<br>so they spend time at the salmon farm<br>sanford salmon farm<br>as well as learn from<br>from people in the industry<br>sort of capstone course as it were is<br>aquify 301 which is field methods<br>for assessment of fisheries and<br>aquatic habitat so this is a class<br>that's actually that actually takes<br>place<br>um<br>before the first semester so<br>around<br>the around waitangi day actually it it<br>it's a field-based course students get<br>the opportunity to<br>go up to the maraya pukataraki and they<br>work on projects relating to community<br>interests so they work with the<br>community to come up with a study that<br>interests them and then they work on<br>that study for the the time that they're<br>up at karatane and then they present<br>those results back to the community so<br>it's very much a<br>from the beginning to the end kind of um<br>process that they learn and it gives<br>them real world skills about how to to<br>do science in a community which is which<br>is awesome<br>um<br>and then the third<br>prerequisite or the third required paper<br>and so<br>here are some images from aquify 301<br>which is a class that if students get<br>the opportunity to take many of them<br>absolutely love<br>because they're out there doing the work<br>and they're out there meeting people in<br>the community who do the work and they<br>get to engage with people and learn from<br>them as well so the the work is done um<br>mostly around the east otago ta'apuri<br>and like i say they're based at<br>bukotaraki marae we stay<br>on the marae so<br>we you know sleep in the faranui we eat<br>in the farakai and we sort of learn<br>about the history of of the place as<br>well so it's a really valuable<br>class for a number of these students<br>um and here is an image here um for<br>following the present the class<br>presentations to the community and of<br>the students um outside the faranui so<br>a really valuable<br>class<br>and a key part i guess of the<br>aquaculture and fisheries work that we<br>do at the university is sharing<br>the research with the community so this<br>i guess is just a snapshot of some of<br>the community reports that we have<br>provided in the past<br>research that's come from students a lot<br>of postgraduate students contribute to<br>this work as well as the researchers as<br>well so it's a key part of<br>i also want to introduce to you um<br>a new center for research excellence<br>called coastal people southern skies<br>that's<br>hosted at the university of otago but<br>also has researchers at other<br>institutions so there are um researchers<br>based at victoria university in the<br>university of auckland it's it's meant<br>to be a<br>national sort of program that draws<br>together researchers and students and<br>community members from around new<br>zealand<br>and it's based on two<br>two main hulls so it has a marine hull<br>and it has a well-being hull so it takes<br>it takes into consideration both of<br>these two things and looks at how<br>climate change is going to affect the<br>marine environment as well as<br>communities as well<br>and built into this<br>um uh<br>moorings which are based around training<br>and monitoring<br>um and then we have these platforms that<br>are called connecting understanding and<br>restoration so involves things like<br>restoring key kaimoana species in in<br>communities<br>um<br>and so the reason why i'm<br>mentioning this is not only because it<br>demonstrates opportunities for research<br>but a building capacity<br>is a huge part of this program as well<br>it's funded by the tertiary education<br>commission so training students training<br>the next generation is a really<br>important part of this program and so<br>there are opportunities for students<br>interested in working in this area<br>there are a number of scholarships that<br>are available for<br>postgraduate study<br>and<br>so it is something that students who<br>want to work in the space can sort of<br>look towards to engage with<br>in terms of careers<br>with aquaculture and fisheries there are<br>a number of places that students can go<br>they can obviously work within the<br>aquaculture industry<br>but they can also end up in places like<br>government departments regional councils<br>uh within universities they can continue<br>their uh i guess learning career and<br>take on postgraduate study and then<br>become researchers at universities they<br>can work at crown institutes so places<br>like cortharon<br>um eb organizations like terunango<br>naitahu<br>and non-governmental organizations um so<br>students who have completed this<br>degree program have ended up in a range<br>of different places and so i'm just<br>going to quickly go through just a few<br>examples<br>um we have josh weibo here who now works<br>for<br>high country salmon<br>um he is the farm and asset manager at<br>high country salmon which is based um<br>just south of twisal<br>and he was just recently<br>nominated as a finalist in<br>in the new zealand seafood sustainably<br>sustainability awards for for the work<br>that he does at high country seven um he<br>was is viewed as an emerging leader in<br>this field um and<br>he um is involved with the raising of<br>and the second example here is<br>namrata chand who was<br>one of the earliest aquafee graduates i<br>met her in 2013 when she was just<br>starting her undergraduate degree and<br>she was<br>digging up some cockles on the beach out<br>at caritani and that's where i first met<br>her and after she graduated with her<br>degree she returned to fiji<br>for five years where she's originally<br>from<br>and she was working as a resilience<br>officer for a united nations habitat<br>project mapping the impacts of climate<br>change<br>on settlements<br>and she also worked for the university<br>of the south pacific and she's actually<br>now back at otago<br>completing a phd in marine science and<br>she's looking at<br>red seaweeds<br>mostly around otago harbour<br>but she credits the aquify 301 paper the<br>the program at<br>is being one of the sort of inspiring<br>moments in her life and one of the<br>the things that really<br>um<br>i guess encouraged her to keep pursuing<br>this this career and this focus for her<br>life so um<br>she's um she's an inspirational young<br>woman and was just recently nominated as<br>one of the 20 under-20s for the<br>so i'm sorry to interrupt you gaia but<br>it's we're just on a bit of a tight time<br>frame today<br>and there is one question in the chat i<br>wondered if you could<br>um<br>answer that it's about diving um<br>students are are students encouraged to<br>get a diving certificate so they can<br>participate fully in the program<br>at the undergraduate level there's no<br>requirement for diving<br>that becomes i guess an optional extra<br>for students who then go on<br>to pursue postgraduate study<br>but i suppose at an undergraduate level<br>if a student was really interested in it<br>there are ways in which we could support<br>their development but it's definitely<br>not a requirement<br>and just before we wrap up is there<br>anything<br>in particular that you would like to<br>finish with before we move to a break<br>um do i just pop off your brilliant bits<br>um i guess the the key thing i would i<br>would like to say is that there is a<br>need for<br>more students and more professionals in<br>this space<br>particularly around<br>how we address some of the challenges<br>that the marine environment are going to<br>face<br>so we need people who understand this<br>this area<br>and who want to work in this area too<br>and i<br>um<br>just on an aside i started my academic<br>career as a law student i wanted to be a<br>lawyer and i didn't know that you could<br>make science a career i just<br>somewhere in that high school journey i<br>i missed that point<br>but i found my way to marine science<br>because<br>of<br>its interdisciplinary nature and the<br>fact that you could work in science but<br>also in policy um and and actually make<br>a difference so<br>that's something i guess i would<br>stress and uh that's i guess i'll where<br>i'll leave it<br>gaia that's awesome thank you and you<br>don't need to worry that you won't have<br>students coming through because i'm<br>based in the auckland office and i was<br>traveling down to coromandel last week<br>and talking to lots of students there<br>about marine science and aquaculture and<br>fisheries and i always find it such a<br>positive<br>thing to talk about because these are<br>the students that want to make changes<br>in the world around climate change and<br>this is a way that they can do it so<br>thank you so much for that presentation<br>wonderful little happy party for you<br>all right so what we're going to do now</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
