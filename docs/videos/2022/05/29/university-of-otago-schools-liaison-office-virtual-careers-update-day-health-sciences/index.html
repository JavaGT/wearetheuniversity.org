so i<br>empathize with those down south with the<br>lovely cold weather this morning it was<br>minus three this morning we went to the<br>gym yeah i'm frozen but it's nice and<br>warm now um it is my pleasure to<br>introduce our session our first session<br>today<br>the sessions today are going to have<br>speakers and the speakers are going to<br>have 20 minutes to have to have a chat<br>about their conversation<br>at the 5-minute mark to go karen is<br>going to ring a bell karen let's ring<br>just forgot him<br>pretty sorry i'm just sending the link<br>to another careers advisor who couldn't<br>find it here's the bell everyone<br>how's that not too loud it's beautiful<br>it's beautiful<br>so far our speakers at the five minute<br>mark that means it's time to start<br>wrapping up your your your session um<br>what we'll do is we will take questions<br>at the end of of the session so we have<br>three speakers first up and we'll take<br>the questions at the end if we if we run<br>out of time for questions if you put<br>them in the chat like karen has said<br>we'll collect them and we'll send out<br>the answers later on um once we get the<br>answers from the speakers<br>everyone's happy we're going to get into<br>it it is my my pleasure to welcome our<br>first speaker professor arlene mcdowell<br>i did a bit of research and i found her<br>her own web page which is cool um i says<br>professor ali mcdowell has an<br>undergraduate in botany and then she's<br>done some pretty cool things looking at<br>drug delivery<br>in um in possum and mice and salmon<br>but today she's not here to talk about<br>any of that kind of stuff there well i<br>don't think so<br>she's here to speak about our newest<br>program one of our news programs called<br>the bachelor of pharmaceutical science<br>um let's give a warm welcome to<br>professor allen mcdowell<br>okay cool take it away<br>great thank you um are you able to see<br>yeah fantastic okay so cure to everybody<br>it really is my pleasure to be here<br>today so i'm the director of a brand new<br>program that we've launched at the<br>university of otago um and i'm very<br>excited to be able to tell you guys um<br>about it today<br>so<br>it's a new degree for the university but<br>also in new zealand so i think that's an<br>important point for you guys is that<br>it's the only offering<br>of this type of degree in new zealand so<br>it's a bachelor of pharmaceutical<br>science and<br>basically it's about trying to sort of<br>bring it down to its essence and it's<br>about the discovery design development<br>assessment and production<br>of medicines but also other bioactive so<br>think about the pharmaceutical industry<br>is the obvious choice where you could<br>think this would lead students however<br>it could also be used in things like the<br>food industry<br>fertilizers and even the explosive<br>industry uses the sort of principles<br>that students would be taught in this<br>degree<br>and it's launched this year so it's all<br>brand new and shiny<br>so i think the global pandemic has<br>really highlighted the importance that<br>we have a workforce that is able to very<br>quickly upskill<br>and produce new medicines um so being<br>able to produce the covert vaccine is<br>quite of an amazing thing that's<br>happened over the recent years and that<br>has used a liposome formulation so it's<br>a type of medicine that's referred to as<br>a nano-medicine<br>and that is something that is<br>incorporated within our degree program<br>so how do you put together a vaccine and<br>so what types of things will students<br>study so people that have got an<br>interest in chemistry this degree would<br>be suited to them so they'll be learning<br>lots about chemical structures um how<br>those components are transferred into<br>powdered formulations because that's<br>typically what industry would work with<br>and then how do we put that into our<br>medicine or a dosage form that people<br>will use sorry my slides are<br>automatically advancing for some reason<br>um so the type of the degree structure<br>that we've got<br>is looking at it's a three years<br>bachelor's degree and so they will start<br>off doing approximately health science<br>first year it's not all of the papers at<br>the moment it's six of the papers um<br>that of health science first year so<br>some chemistry and biology and sales and<br>things like that<br>and then our degree offers four papers<br>at 200 level<br>and then six papers at the 300 level<br>and there's information about that in<br>the details on the web page i'll give<br>you we're also in the process of<br>developing an honours year so after they<br>would complete their bachelor's degree<br>they could stay and do a research year<br>that would be an honours<br>degree and then of course we encourage<br>students to progress into research<br>degrees and do something like a phd or a<br>master's so that they can continue on<br>so another type of thing that we will be<br>studying or the students will be<br>studying is about dosage forms so how do<br>you put medicines um into patients um so<br>the range of different dosage forms<br>asthma inhalers tablets are very common<br>injections those types of things<br>and also understanding what happens once<br>that medicine is in the body um so the<br>blood levels and the and the effects<br>that those drugs have on patients as<br>well<br>the other important aspect of our degree<br>um is that we will be incorporating<br>principles of rawanga in our degree so<br>acknowledging the very important<br>knowledge that we have um in that the<br>maori traditional medicines um in new<br>zealand but also acknowledging that<br>around the world traditional medicines<br>are used um by a large number of people<br>so spending time looking at extracting<br>you know the active compounds from plant<br>materials and what effect do they have<br>on cells and again that's a bit of a<br>how will you study um we've got an<br>amazing group of really dedicated<br>academic staff that are subject experts<br>so we come from quite a varied group so<br>pharmaceutical science<br>is a multi-disciplinary sort of area um<br>so we have microbiologists chemists um<br>as the interduction i trained as a<br>botanist um and we've got biochemists um<br>and pharmacists um that are part of our<br>team so fantastic group of people that<br>are very active in research so it really<br>is research informed teaching that the<br>students will receive<br>um we're going to have a lot of small<br>group activities so this is where<br>students can really get down one-on-one<br>with academics and the teaching staff<br>and really understand the principles<br>that they're going through so they get a<br>very thorough knowledge<br>of the material<br>and very importantly it's a hands-on<br>degree so we're really encouraging<br>students um to when in the lab lots of<br>individual activities lots of stuff so<br>they're going to be very um skilled in<br>having these um pretty lab skills and<br>practical skills that we know that the<br>industry wants so lots of stuff and<br>experiments in the labs that students<br>so the outcome the graduate outcomes for<br>this program um so we would um expect<br>that our graduates will be demonstrating<br>specialist knowledge so they're going to<br>uniquely know about things like<br>chemistry and formulation science and<br>pharmacokinetics and medicines economics<br>and those sorts of things with practical<br>skills as i've mentioned so we expect<br>that they can work efficiently and<br>appropriately in a lab<br>and also be able to apply that knowledge<br>that they've learnt in order to be able<br>to solve the contemporary challenges so<br>the next pandemic that comes along um we<br>will be able to have some home-grown<br>graduates um that can be contributing to<br>the development of those sorts of<br>medicines<br>of international relevance as well so we<br>would like that it not only helps new<br>zealand but of course we can have a<br>global impact on where these graduates<br>so where can they go and once students<br>graduate from our degree pharmaceutical<br>industry as i mentioned is the the<br>natural choice it's the obvious<br>progression from this type of degree and<br>that's both within new zealand um and<br>internationally so we've spoken with<br>international leaders um in the field<br>around the world um to under when we're<br>putting together this degree and<br>developing it so we know what they want<br>and so we've been able to meet those<br>needs of what international industry is<br>after<br>things like analytical chemists so<br>border control workers so working out<br>what drugs have been imported into the<br>country and that's a potential place<br>where people could work<br>as i mentioned in the introduction think<br>wider than just pharma so cosmetics<br>industry food industries paint is just a<br>formulation it's effectively a cosmetic<br>for your wall<br>agrochemicals are making fertilizers<br>that we rely on in new zealand and as<br>i've mentioned explosive industries so<br>putting in the mining industry making<br>bombs that blow up mines<br>spin out companies is also a really cool<br>opportunity so if students are<br>entrepreneurial and interested in<br>pushing the boundary and maybe combining<br>things with a little bit of<br>commerce and economics then that's sort<br>of a really nice way that students can<br>know some science knowledge but then<br>expand it into some cool spin out<br>companies<br>government organizations are always<br>after types of graduates that know<br>things about medicines and knowing the<br>regulations um and how you test quality<br>of products and things like that<br>patent attorneys again a nice<br>combination of a law and science um sort<br>of put together in this sort of<br>pharmaceutical<br>space um and many others so as you'll<br>appreciate this is a new degree and so<br>we're very interested to follow where<br>our students go<br>but this is looking at examples of other<br>degrees at monash university in<br>australia has a similar program so we've<br>looked to see where their graduates go<br>and that's where we would expect<br>i also just wanted to highlight that in<br>building this degree we've established<br>some international collaboration so i<br>mentioned that we've got that<br>international hookup so um china is<br>someplace that we've got some<br>relationships built with chinese<br>universities um india and taiwan is also<br>places um where we are going to and the<br>european market um is also represented<br>in research collaborations that we have<br>within the school so it's not just a new<br>zealand degree we've got some real<br>international representation occurring<br>too<br>so i just thought i'd head off some<br>questions these are typical questions<br>that people get how is it farm side<br>different from other existing programs<br>um so the school of pharmacy offers this<br>new degree but we also have a bachelor<br>of pharmacy that's been running for a<br>very long time but this is at the um<br>bachelor of pharmacy is a professional<br>degree so that's for students that would<br>like to work in a pharmacy in a hospital<br>or in the community so these the<br>students from beef and psy are not<br>considered to be professional students<br>um in terms of being able to practice<br>being a pharmacist<br>is it different from a bachelor of<br>science majoring in pharmacology um yes<br>it is the pharmacology major is much<br>more focused than what we would do we<br>have a very broad degree that takes<br>students really from<br>the inception of the chemistry of<br>individual compounds and why they active<br>all the way through to formulation<br>understanding how they work and then<br>marketing and regulation and quality<br>control so our degree covers in pharma<br>pharmacologists incorporated within that<br>um but our degree is a whole lot broader<br>and is it different from by mid-sci with<br>drugs and human health that degree has<br>more of a biomedical focus um again<br>those aspects are incorporated in our<br>degree but our degree is broader than<br>that<br>and i've probably already touched on<br>that last point um that the bee farms<br>die is what's required by industry um if<br>people want to go through and work in<br>that degree um our consultation has<br>shown that that's where<br>um they<br>people in industry like to ask the beef<br>so if you would like to learn more i'm<br>happy to answer questions through the<br>various channels that we we can but on<br>the school of pharmacy website we've got<br>a tile um where we students can find out<br>or you guys can find out more<br>information there's also an email<br>address that actually comes to me<br>ultimately so an administrator and<br>filters that through to me so it's<br>probably me that will be answering<br>questions that come through there but<br>happy to do that<br>and i just thought i'd leave you with a<br>little bit of the marketing so this has<br>been an important part i've had to up<br>skill in marketing and knowing about<br>what we need to do so medication<br>innovation is one of the taglines that<br>we've we've um<br>settled on so understanding how we make<br>innovative medicines and also the fact<br>that as i mentioned we're a unique new<br>lab-based degree that occurs<br>in new zealand<br>so i've made it nice and quick for you<br>guys so there's five minutes for<br>questions i guess but i'll hand that<br>over to the chair and i will stop<br>sharing<br>awesome thank you arlene um we've got<br>some time so um forget what i said<br>before about bringing your questions in<br>the chat um does anybody have any<br>questions that alien can answer straight<br>don't be shy to turn off your mute and<br>ask away<br>reduce am i allowed to ask a question<br>no<br>i should know the answer i'm school's<br>liaison<br>i mean i'm just wondering so because we<br>meet students in high school and they're<br>often not really sure exactly where they<br>want to go like what would you what<br>advice would you give them about which<br>pathway to take to keep as many options<br>open<br>sure so this we're our degree you're<br>able to mix and match with other<br>subjects um so you don't have to purely<br>do the bachelor of pharmaceutical<br>science if you don't want to lock in<br>quite so closely yet and you can<br>supplement our degree with other papers<br>so if you are interested in chemistry do<br>some chemistry papers do some of our<br>papers and then that keeps your options<br>open<br>about where you ultimately end up so our<br>degree is able to blend with other<br>botany is also a really nice match<br>because a lot of the stuff you know a<br>lot of drugs and actives come from<br>plants<br>food science would be another good match<br>um so the students are able to keep that<br>diversity for the first couple of years<br>anyway um until they sort of establish<br>which area sort of excites them the most<br>and where they want to go<br>awesome thank you we've just had a few<br>questions so one is what are the entry<br>requirements and i'm assuming it will be<br>ue but the second thing is um are there<br>any restrictions on the number of<br>students in the degree yep cool thank<br>you um so entry requirements they'll<br>need to come through from health science<br>first year effectively so if they pass<br>their papers at first year level that's<br>all we're after we're not after a<br>particular grade requirement they just<br>need to pass those health science first<br>year papers<br>and other restriction of numbers no not<br>yet we've been welcoming students with<br>open arms and we're just starting off<br>this year so we have a small cohort<br>and we imagine that we'll build over<br>time and so we haven't had to kept that<br>right thanks and one other question so<br>students that have studied the bachelor<br>of biomed in their first year as opposed<br>to how say first year so they didn't do<br>health say first year they started in<br>the bachelor of biomed are they able to<br>swap into the second year of your degree<br>i will say yes with a qualifier that<br>they'll just need to make sure the<br>prerequisites are hit so so we have six<br>papers that are required in the first<br>year so if they've done and passed those<br>papers um then yes we would accept them<br>into that<br>those are great questions anyone else<br>but here's another question um from<br>myora can<br>can the existing scholarship scholarship<br>apply to entrance into this degree i<br>think the answer is yes to that i think<br>here's a question that i was is actually<br>on my mind arlene um a student asked me<br>about cosmetic design a few days ago and<br>also about becoming a perfumer is this<br>something that we can<br>get into with this program here yeah<br>well sure i mean the principles that you<br>know formulation science is mixing<br>things right mixing chemicals together<br>and having a particular outcome so yeah<br>gosh that's cool i've never heard of<br>doing that sort of um<br>that opportunity but yes the skills they<br>would learn through us would be would be<br>relevant to that program yeah cool<br>thank you brett<br>these are fantastic questions um<br>we've got lots of time here<br>we're really learning too about what<br>sort of students would be interested in<br>that degree right we've got an idea um<br>but we're fascinated to hear the types<br>of students and their pathways where<br>they think they're going to go<br>um sort of through this degree that<br>would be useful to them<br>i have a question for you all in just<br>leading of that there<br>university of canterbury has a<br>formulation design in their in their um<br>product product innovation program<br>how would that equate to the<br>pharmaceutical science could they learn<br>the same skill set and um it'll be<br>similar again i think we probably go<br>from more basics through so the pipeline<br>is probably longer through our degree um<br>so you know we are really we've got<br>chemists that are really fantastic at<br>identifying targets for new drugs and<br>that sort of stuff so students will<br>learn about that detailed aspects of<br>chemistry and then at the end we've got<br>a paper that is you know looking at um<br>you know what you need to know to be in<br>pharma um and sort of what are the<br>market regulations and the costs sort of<br>you know<br>implications of medicines and those<br>sorts of things so it really goes from<br>the beginning to the end<br>grant um<br>we've got two questions i want sponsors<br>cheryl um do you want to speak about<br>your connection to to maori medicine and<br>how that's going to integrate into the<br>program yeah so at the moment um thank<br>you for that question at the moment we<br>we do have some<br>maori representation within the bachelor<br>of pharmacy and so we have some<br>traditional medicine um<br>consultants that come and teach to our<br>bachelor of pharmacy students so we've<br>got a connection with those that they're<br>willing to contribute into one of our<br>third year papers and that we're going<br>to be focusing on maori medicine but<br>also international medicines as well um<br>and so and we also have quite a strong<br>focus we've got an associate dean maori<br>um leanne takadu um so he's with our<br>group and she's a very enthusiastic um<br>supporter of of making sure that you<br>know the maori medicines are utilized<br>appropriately and so leanne is having<br>feedback into our program as well<br>brilliant pauline there's there's a<br>question that that just from um<br>from k who just wants to see the slide<br>about the degree structure just to see<br>how it actually looks just as a bit of<br>her<br>okay<br>so kay is asking how do they manage to<br>fit in other sciences in into the<br>program oh sure yes i actually took that<br>one out um sorry i didn't i had<br>something more detailed and then i took<br>it out so we are required we offer four<br>papers um in second year and so students<br>can take another two papers um as part<br>of the program so they could pick up two<br>chemistry papers chemistry botany food<br>science other sorts of um and then in<br>the third year they're only required to<br>do four of the six that we offer um so<br>again there's options for them to do<br>another couple of papers as well as our<br>papers<br>just to remind everybody as well you<br>know when young people come to the<br>university they will be helped along the<br>way so even if they're not too sure what<br>they're doing in their first year at<br>each stage they will be able to they'll<br>help to grow their degree and build<br>their degree<br>the other thing i wanted to point out<br>too is that students can supplement if<br>they're doing a bachelor of science<br>degree they can dip in and do one or two<br>or three of our papers so they can still<br>perhaps get that taste of the<br>formulation or parts of our degree that<br>they're interested in to sort of<br>supplement their knowledge you know if<br>they do even doing an arts degree or<br>anything they can still pick up so we're<br>in 18 point papers um so we're very<br>consistent so students can sort of mix<br>and match um through the university<br>programs<br>yeah karen how much how much time do we<br>have karen yeah<br>we don't have too much time but just<br>some of these quick questions so um<br>entry is the similar papers to health<br>side first year but house like fish is<br>seven papers yeah<br>you you and it's the physics one that<br>okay okay all right which is the one<br>that you don't need from house safety so<br>it's a public health finally<br>okay cool another quick fire question do<br>your graduates go on to douglas medicine<br>that is an option that's an option yeah<br>cool and if a student has to pick<br>physics or bio what would you recommend<br>we need both um for this degree at the<br>moment um yeah so they would need to do<br>both um awesome thank you thank you very<br>much arlene i'll hand it back to you<br>produce<br>awesome um thank you very much alex<br>any more questions just put them in the<br>chat and like i said we will collate<br>them and we'll send them to alien and we<br>can we'll reply them back to everybody<br>uh marlene thank you so much for that i<br>mean it's really awesome to see this new<br>program they're the only one in new<br>zealand but there was something about<br>this program is that it incorporates<br>both maori maori medicine and western<br>medicine but also it's good<br>international focus and i'm sure our<br>young people out there um would be keen<br>to to get involved in this program here<br>especially because the world is changing<br>quite dramatically in that space there<br>um thank you very much arlene let's give<br>her a shout out for everybody<br>cool<br>well yeah there we go fantastic um thank<br>you ali are you hanging around are you<br>going to log off<br>no i was going to hang around and have a<br>listen to some others i'm probably<br>awesome cool fantastic<br>brilliant thank you very much ali next<br>up we have um some of my favorite people<br>um from genetics are they in the room<br>yes we're here<br>yeah awesome cool so so next up we have<br>associate professor tina summerfield and<br>dr julia makai the reason why i say this<br>one of my favorite favorite people is<br>you can read all the bio about that but<br>when i met um these two lovely people it<br>was um they said to me hey we're gonna<br>we're gonna commit a murder and then<br>we're gonna find out um who came with<br>the crime and then i ended up being the<br>person that was murdered um which was<br>quite quite quite sad but it was a very<br>it was a very very practical way of<br>showing how gen how geneticists do some<br>part of their work and our team has been<br>very lucky to go into the lab and<br>extract dna and do some pretty cool<br>things with them<br>um so i'm going to hand it over to them<br>to talk about the program that we run at<br>the university of otago<br>thanks tim and who's speaking first i<br>guess you guys will<br>sort it out<br>um kia ora everyone so i'm dr julie<br>mckay<br>i'm associate professor tina somerville<br>kyola<br>you're all good<br>yeah perfect okay and i should have said<br>i'm the senior teaching fellow for<br>and i'm the deputy director of the<br>genetics teaching program so why<br>genetics so i think oh i'm on the wrong<br>journey<br>i think actually i think it's a really<br>exciting time to study genetics i think<br>um we finally got the the technological<br>advances in the last five or ten years<br>the computational power and um<br>some molecular tools that really enable<br>us to sort of answer ask the questions<br>that people have been wanting to um to<br>look at for a long time so it's a really<br>groundbreaking subject and<br>impacts lots and lots of different areas<br>of of your life so which hopefully will<br>convince you it's practical hands-on<br>students are in the lab<br>doing lab work writing lab reports and<br>we like to challenge the students in<br>terms of their practical skills and in<br>terms of critical thinking<br>as i said it impacts on every area of<br>our of our society of our lives<br>and we like to say that it's taught by<br>top genetics researchers and<br>practitioners that from across australia<br>so we would say that we've got some<br>really enthusiastic genetics researchers<br>that we're able to to draw into the<br>teaching program<br>and it's wide-ranging so if you're<br>interested in biology<br>i think that genetics encompasses lots<br>and lots of different areas of biology<br>so from the medical side across to sort<br>of things in the environmental side as<br>well and we've put together<br>content in our program that covers all<br>of those areas<br>so it says the comprehensive course<br>um so why<br>out of togo really said this i think so<br>genetics is important um<br>in all modern biology so<br>things i'm going to show you some<br>examples right and including includes<br>medicine as well<br>okay so um<br>we can use genetic techniques to look at<br>dna and we can use this to solve crimes<br>or look at paternity testing and in the<br>um the image here you can see this is a<br>car park in leicester and um under this<br>car park in leicester there was a<br>skeleton found and and by analyzing the<br>dna they found that it was the skeleton<br>of king richard iii and so they compared<br>the dna in the skeletons to some known<br>living relatives so one of those was<br>benedict cumberbatch the actor and they<br>were able to prove that this was in fact<br>the skeleton of king richard and they<br>were able to give and give him a proper<br>king's burial<br>so we can use lots of different genetic<br>modification techniques and i mean it's<br>it's amazing what we can do now with<br>genetics to so to solve lots of<br>different problems so here's just an<br>example and of some fluorescent genes<br>and we can look at gene expression you<br>in living tissue using fluorescent genes<br>so these are just some examples of some<br>bacteria and this is a jellyfish and the<br>green fluorescent protein so that's my<br>favorite gene comes from this jelly fish<br>and it glows under uv light so we can<br>attach that gene and to other genes and<br>look at where the genes are being<br>expressed in living tissue and if you go<br>to america you can actually go into a<br>pet shop and you can buy a fluorescent<br>fish a fluorescent zebrafish but in new<br>zealand and out here we can't do this so<br>we've got really strict regulation um<br>around genetic modification and what we<br>so there's also a range of applications<br>in plant research and agriculture so if<br>we think outside of so i guess there's<br>two branches there's one where you think<br>you might genetically modify or engineer<br>an organism to to improve it but there's<br>also a lot of value in knowing uh the<br>diversity of organisms and their genetic<br>background and being able to select the<br>best organism so in new zealand that's<br>currently where we're at we're using the<br>more traditional genetics approaches but<br>we still have this massive potential<br>around genetic engineering and genome<br>editing so things like<br>improving cow fertility<br>things like improving um<br>crops selecting for increased resistance<br>so just being able to identify<br>individuals that are more resistant the<br>genetic basis for that and selecting for<br>them also things like detecting psa so<br>you'll remember that there's a kiwi<br>fruit infection with psa using genetic<br>and also um<br>linked to agriculture as well things<br>like mitigating the effects of climate<br>change so we know there's going to be<br>changes in whether the patterns is this<br>growing human population there's going<br>to be a lot of challenges in the future<br>so genetics is definitely something that<br>can be drawn on to support that and<br>again in the two two ways going back to<br>looking at natural populations this<br>example here where you're going back to<br>looking at wild wheat varieties that<br>maybe are more resistant to to changes<br>things like drought and and extreme<br>weather patterns that we're going to be<br>seeing<br>and also you've got the potential to<br>genetically engineer organisms as well<br>here we've got another example it's<br>looking at um thinking about using<br>genetic engineering for<br>making more less methane producing cows<br>and steep is another area of research<br>and also um<br>it's not just agriculture the<br>agricultural industry that's affected by<br>climate change you've got native plants<br>that they can be affected too and it's<br>looking at how<br>we can use genetic tools to sort of<br>so geneticists is obviously a really<br>important part of medicine<br>and<br>so there's again there's different<br>aspects of genetics that can play a role<br>in medicine so um<br>obviously there's diagnostics and<br>there's also using genetic technology so<br>we can use um dna cloning and that was<br>the technology that is used to make the<br>pfizer vaccine so the very first step in<br>making the visor vaccine is we've got to<br>be able to get that um<br>that gene the despite protein and and be<br>able to make the messenger rna so that's<br>obviously using genetic techniques and<br>um<br>there's other<br>drugs and um therapies that are produced<br>so like human the insulin that's that's<br>produced for treatment for diabetics is<br>made using dna cloning technology<br>also more and more in the future<br>and<br>medicine is going to be targeted<br>specifically around your genomes so<br>it's getting cheaper and cheaper to<br>sequence the person's genome and i mean<br>really we're still in the stone age of<br>actually understanding all this<br>information but um hope you know in the<br>future um hopefully that medicines will<br>be actually targeted to your specific<br>genome and um yeah to provide treatment<br>and obviously uh covet's been in the<br>news constantly and from a genetics<br>point of view it's actually amazing that<br>people are just freely talking about pcr<br>and um variants and things like that so<br>from genetics point of view we're quite<br>excited about that<br>um so it's yeah it's it's amazing that<br>um obviously you looking at genomes and<br>so you guys actually understand this now<br>that we can use it to look at genome<br>differences and be able to track the<br>phrase mutations that are happening um<br>and there's also applications that are<br>specific to ltr so things for example<br>working with marrow communities looking<br>at things like metabolic disease things<br>that are more prevalent in the maori<br>community<br>and also thinking about thomas species<br>um<br>and<br>understanding them more but in<br>particular looking at conservation<br>efforts for example here we've got the<br>kakapo so there's been the<br>sequencing of the kakapo genome and<br>that's really across the whole a lot of<br>individuals really informing um the best<br>conservation practices and the best<br>breeding selection practices for that<br>that species<br>um so why come to otago and to study<br>genetics um<br>so it's really um<br>i think one of the things about the<br>genetics is it's the genetics teaching<br>program so we're not a department we're<br>a program and that means that we can<br>draw on researchers from across the<br>university and so we have people from<br>health sciences and sciences teaching<br>into our degree so we've got people from<br>nine different departments who are all<br>active genetics researchers teaching<br>into our degree and that means we really<br>cover a breadth of genetic interests so<br>we've got that medical health science<br>component from people who like anatomy<br>by chemistry microbiology immunology<br>pathology pharmacology and toxicology<br>uh women and children's health and for<br>example in third year we have one paper<br>that is all medical genetics but we also<br>cover more broad areas of biology<br>and getting out into the things um other<br>organisms so they're really looking at<br>the breadth of bio and biological<br>diversity and and powerful tools to look<br>at that and we have people from botany<br>that includes myself and zoology and<br>also maths and stats looking at<br>what is this me as well<br>oh no it's me<br>tell<br>okay so how do we actually teach<br>genetics so um at university there's a<br>range of different methods we use so<br>obviously there's lectures uh there's<br>what we call wet labs so where the<br>students are actually getting in and<br>doing experiments um with things and<br>obviously now because um we need our<br>students to be able to handle um<br>data sets and sequences so there's<br>computer labs there's also a really big<br>part of genetics is debates and ethics<br>there's lots of group work presentations<br>by third year our students are doing<br>things like many research project<br>projects they<br>have a visit to our local cri and ad<br>research and also<br>obviously you to be a genetic student<br>you've got to analyze your own dna<br>sequence so um our students in third<br>year get to sequence their own<br>mitochondrial dna and analyze that and<br>they also get to and do karyotypes on<br>so it's a really exciting time to be<br>learning genetics as i said because it's<br>so powerful and so this great power of<br>genetics means that we've actually got<br>some really challenging questions to<br>think about so we've got things like uh<br>people talking about things like<br>de-extinction so should we be bringing<br>back uh<br>the mower for example you know should<br>that happen and also we've got things<br>happening internationally for example in<br>in china you've got uh genome edited<br>babies and so along with this real<br>excitement comes a lot of um<br>considerations and a lot of um<br>i guess challenges around sort of the<br>ethical cultural and and regulatory<br>perspectives on that and that's<br>something that we talk about a lot along<br>um the degree as well so i think it's a<br>really exciting and challenging time and<br>even just considering new zealand's<br>stance on genetic engineering and now we<br>have these new technologies that are<br>that are uh<br>very<br>allow for very precise editing of the<br>genome in a way that you might see<br>happen in nature anyway so there's<br>really some challenges at the very local<br>level as well to think about<br>okay so what do you need if you're a<br>student at school i i'd say if you're a<br>student at school and you're enjoying<br>biology and chemistry then genetics is<br>really something that you might consider<br>so if you're taking<br>third year biology chemistry and maths<br>and we're thinking also the maths more<br>the statistical side they would be<br>really useful things to have if you if<br>you were intending to study genetics but<br>um they are recommended but they're not<br>essential<br>and so when you come at<br>first year to study genetics we actually<br>only have two papers that we ask you to<br>take so it's cells 191 and chemistry uh<br>191 and so cells really covers um our<br>genetics teaching at first year it's<br>really the sort of the basics of<br>genetics but it also covers a range of<br>other of other cellular biology as well<br>plus you get to pick from a range of<br>papers uh including<br>biology of animals<br>plants how they change the world<br>biochemistry ecology<br>human health and so maths and stats as<br>well we recommend you do take some<br>biochemistry and some statistics<br>but there's lots of space in there i<br>guess the thing about the gene program<br>is there's lots of space to try things<br>out so if you like biology and chemistry<br>but you're not really sure where to<br>commit then you could you could think<br>about starting with genetics and then<br>trying to sample a few of these other<br>papers and and sort of narrow down<br>either i think it's quite a challenge<br>you know to<br>pick what you want to do when you<br>haven't you don't haven't got any<br>experience of it so you can come and<br>start knowing that you just take those<br>two papers and then you can sort of<br>okay and then um what can we do with a<br>genetics degree so for career options<br>again and and because it's it's so broad<br>and because we actually fit in with lots<br>of different other majors and different<br>paper choices as well even within even<br>the third year so it kind of depends on<br>what sort of path the student has taken<br>throughout their genetics uh to tackle<br>what they might end up doing so that um<br>athena says they might be really maths<br>and statsy um and so if they're like<br>we're crying out for um<br>students that can um handle statistics<br>and genetics there's lots of jobs in<br>that like in quantitative genetics and<br>things like that and then also if<br>they're really into computers there's a<br>whole field of bioinformatics and again<br>they're crying out for jobs in that or<br>they might be and that's not the thing<br>at all and there's um there's other job<br>options where you might you might be<br>doing more um traditional research in a<br>lab um<br>so there's options to<br>work in health medicine and<br>biotechnology so working in trend<br>research institutes universities biotech<br>companies there's actually an amazing<br>number of biotech companies in new<br>zealand um diagnostics cytogenetics<br>embryologists genomics so a huge field<br>evolution conservation if they've gone<br>more down<br>the zoology or the botany kind of path<br>um in genetics agriculture horticulture<br>gov and working for government<br>departments like doc or mpi<br>there's also um law engine is a really<br>good fit as well and a scientific ethics<br>from law or patient law specialist um<br>genetic counselling<br>journalism social media politics and<br>teaching as well and stein sales and<br>marketing and here's just a few of our<br>recent graduates and so um some of those<br>have gone on and to do um are doing<br>postgraduates now and then uh fernan<br>who's one of um<br>in the photo she is um doing going on to<br>work at ag research in an animal<br>genetics um<br>field<br>okay so that's yeah that's it<br>any questions<br>all right awesome team um we've got some<br>time for some questions so we'll stop<br>the screen sharing and then we can ask<br>questions<br>remove the spotlight<br>fantastic any questions anymore<br>that's the question<br>yeah you're gonna address that one i'll<br>do all of them yeah so um kay ask the<br>question would a student need need a<br>postgrad qualification to study genetics<br>to gain a position after graduating or<br>do undergrads get get positions which<br>follows on your last slide yes<br>i<br>i should go for it<br>i think that if you know you want to<br>work in a research environment then you<br>probably need that fourth year<br>um because it gives you i mean the thing<br>up fourth here is that half of your time<br>is spent in a research lab so you have a<br>real you know you come out with a lot<br>more experience than you do at 300 level<br>so you say you would<br>not necessarily not be able to get it<br>but you'd very likely be competing for<br>positions with people who did have that<br>extra<br>qualification<br>it would depend yeah and i suppose it<br>depends at what level because<br>yeah if they're going in like our<br>graduates our<br>straight bsc graduates do get positions<br>as well but it would be a lower level<br>and some of them might end up going on<br>further after that as well so it cannot<br>yes was it depends yeah who they end up<br>working for<br>awesome<br>anybody else any other questions i've<br>got a question for you um why would we<br>come to our targeted genetics<br>i think because we cover<br>uh a whole range of genetics i had a<br>quick look at the i don't know if i'm<br>allowed to say this<br>another university<br>and it seemed to me that their genetics<br>was<br>mostly it was in the biomedical sciences<br>and it was really had the strong<br>biomedical focus now we do have a<br>biomedical focus um but we also cover<br>that the whole range of genetics right<br>so we don't just focus on biomedical and<br>i think then one of the nice things<br>about<br>the second year is that there's only<br>three papers that we uh<br>that are genetic papers and so you've<br>got that flexibility that if you like<br>the medical side you can take some more<br>medical focus papers if you like the uh<br>zoology or botanical side you can fit in<br>some of those papers as well and also<br>you can you can take a so that expand<br>out to sort of a non-science paper or<br>you know really try some different<br>things in there so i'd say that breadth<br>i'd say this<br>i mean of course i'm completely biased<br>right i feel like we have we have um<br>the teaching program but we also have<br>genetic sataco which is uh the sort of<br>the research arm and i think there's a<br>lot of energy around genetics down here<br>there's a lot of um really enthusiastic<br>researchers who love to to teach into<br>the program as well so<br>thank you a lot<br>a lot of you in this forum here so it's<br>all good<br>accepting<br>any other questions from<br>anybody else out there<br>or from schools there's on that that you<br>might have got with students as well<br>now<br>well again no questions but again if you<br>think i'll start with that question<br>no um again if you think of any<br>questions pop them in the chat and we<br>will collect them and send them to the<br>dream team in genetics um the other cool<br>thing about genetics is they have<br>amazing t-shirts and i don't know if you<br>can see jillian's teacher there but it's<br>pretty amazing<br>so boom that's a great creation to<br>genetics um the other the other thing is<br>um<br>do you want to put talk briefly about<br>the hands-on programmers of the judo<br>genetics do you have a program there<br>with hands-on<br>yeah that's right so we do both hands-on<br>and we do the um<br>science academy the oh what what's up<br>so we yeah we offer programs there so<br>actually both students get to clone the<br>jeans so they get to come down and and<br>do gene cloning and um yeah we normally<br>kill off our genetics technician as well<br>so they can solve a crime and um yeah<br>lots and look at fruitfly genetics so<br>yeah quite uh again a broad um<br>project for those for those guys um yeah<br>and they really enjoy it so we're both<br>involved in that um yeah and really<br>enjoy it yeah it's good fun<br>yeah and that's a little plug that for<br>hands on otago which we'll talk about<br>later on as well it's a great program<br>too for young people to get involved in<br>but there's no more questions um let's<br>um raise our hands and say thank you to<br>um<br>america<br>the dream team um so wait a minute<br>there's a question why there's a<br>question awesome thank thanks ally hold<br>on hold on applause if a school leaver<br>doesn't have a science background would<br>they struggle<br>i<br>think no because i think the for example<br>it might it might be a challenge right<br>if you have no science at all um i'd say<br>that the first year the first year<br>courses do tend to be quite a lot of<br>content but there's a really great<br>support crew around first year so if the<br>student was say<br>you know a very committed student was<br>really keen to get involved in it they<br>they could catch up um with support from<br>you know the teaching fellows around<br>that there's really the first year um<br>papers are really very well supported<br>and so that they would have you know<br>access to one-on-one tutorials and and<br>a whole lot of<br>online support as well so i think it's<br>awesome<br>thanks tina sorry i'm just producing<br>loves to talk about genetics but um we<br>need to um focus on the bio ethics minor<br>i'm going for the bell<br>for the bell<br>thanks a lot our genetics team produced<br>you want to um welcome neil yeah awesome<br>thank you thank you team um let's give<br>them a hard round of applause now before<br>we though okay<br>um all we've noticed our last two<br>speakers is um they both had a common<br>thread which was talking about um<br>covered with the covered pandemic the<br>vaccine and production and the genomes<br>and i guess in in the world we live in<br>today that raises a whole nother another<br>realm of um interest which is bioethics<br>and our next speaker associate professor<br>dr neil pickering<br>is going to speak about the bioethics<br>mind that we have at the university of<br>otago welcome to our session dr<br>pickering<br>kiara koto i don't have a presentation<br>so i'm afraid you're going to have to uh<br>put up with looking at me<br>um<br>hi so my name's neil and i uh come from<br>the uh bioethics center at the<br>university of otago te po kapu matatiki<br>curry order<br>and i'm very pleased to have the<br>opportunity to speak to you briefly<br>today actually about a subject you may<br>never have heard of<br>i don't have too much time so i'm going<br>to have to be<br>fairly quick about it<br>now um i wonder how many of your<br>students<br>who are thinking of studying would like<br>along with having a great student<br>experience and perhaps getting a good<br>job at the end of it all<br>would like to make the world a better<br>place<br>but this raises a question<br>what sort of world<br>is a better one<br>than the one we have currently<br>the bioethics is the study<br>of right and wrong<br>and good and bad<br>in relation to living things<br>and its methods<br>are those of critical reflection on<br>argument<br>now many students who go to university<br>will be<br>aiming to study living things in fact<br>our speakers so far today<br>have been describing options to study<br>uh pharmacuticals and genetics for<br>example and later on i think someone<br>will even be talking to you about<br>aquaculture<br>so students<br>for instance in these courses you've<br>already heard what they will learn in<br>them but just<br>they might learn about how the body<br>metabolizes drugs or<br>they may learn about some genes<br>contribution to disease<br>now bioethics asks should questions<br>this drug<br>may have this hope hopeful effect on<br>humans<br>should we try it out on animals first<br>this drug<br>could make humans smarter<br>is that the kind of drug we should be<br>developing<br>this gene<br>causes an incurable fatal disease<br>we might be able to eradicate it from<br>families by germline gene therapy<br>but is germline gene therapy a good<br>thing<br>this gene is supposedly connected to<br>altruism<br>should we seek to implant it in everyone<br>these questions<br>and many hundreds more like them are<br>likely to arise for any thoughtful young<br>person<br>and to occur more as they develop<br>alongside all the other questions they<br>have<br>and alongside their other studies<br>now these questions made it back may be<br>debated in classrooms<br>uh<br>in student studies in cafeterias and in<br>bars typically they are<br>but bioethics is not the mere venting of<br>opinions<br>it aims at light<br>not heat<br>it's the systematic study of reasons<br>which can be used to decide what makes a<br>better world and not only for humans but<br>for animals and plants too<br>it aims to provide students<br>with reflectively developed ways of<br>thinking<br>through questions about what may be<br>wrong with the present<br>and how the future should look<br>so a bioethics minor<br>lies alongside other studies indeed<br>though i focused on the sciences largely<br>a bioethics finder is for anyone at<br>otago<br>it can be taken alongside any major<br>and i might add only otago<br>offers this minor<br>those who teach it<br>largely but not only from the bioethics<br>center are highly research active<br>international experts in their<br>specialist<br>fields a student<br>who takes the core<br>papers of the minor will have considered<br>bioethics in relation to the life<br>sciences<br>in relation to human health<br>in relation to animals<br>and in relation to the environment<br>they will have had the opportunity to<br>consider approaches which arise<br>internationally<br>nationally<br>and indigenously<br>they will be able to articulate<br>what a better world<br>may look like<br>awesome thank you dr pickering any<br>questions<br>i have a question for you how many<br>students do you think or have you got<br>interested in the program at the moment<br>is that a very common uh well<br>the program only started this year<br>and this is the first time actually<br>we've attempted to uh to market it<br>uh<br>currently we have eight students<br>doing it<br>we have many many more students doing<br>individual papers<br>and<br>you'll notice from what the other<br>presenters have been<br>saying that there are always<br>opportunities for students to pick up<br>additional papers apart from the core<br>ones and hours<br>are offered in second and third year<br>to those students but what the bioethics<br>minor does is enable them to take a<br>number of these and come out with a a<br>parallel qualification<br>and suppose nail that i i love by<br>athletics as the miner does that then<br>allow me to apply for any postgrad study<br>in the bioethics program later on yeah<br>we yeah we have a very active<br>postgraduate<br>um<br>program<br>uh we have two streams bioethics pure<br>bioethics on the one hand<br>and bioethics and health law<br>on the other hand we do postgraduate<br>diplomas masters<br>and phds<br>fantastic brilliant it's great to see<br>that they can grow into the program if<br>any questions about the bioethics<br>program<br>now if there's none i've got one<br>produced now i'm just wondering what<br>else is offered at other universities<br>now like who else is doing the spanish<br>stuff<br>um<br>we know we've got good connections with<br>teachers in the other universities but<br>there's no other systematic program<br>we also actually teach into the<br>individual<br>but<br>this is an opportunity<br>for students to bring together all these<br>different areas of interest they might<br>have and<br>systematically<br>consider the whole sort of ethical<br>impact of what's going on in science<br>and also in other<br>in other<br>parts of society as well<br>and that there's a leading question<br>there for you neil is um if i was a year<br>13 student<br>at school what kind of young person<br>would be attracted to this program<br>because you know we have we have<br>philosophy which is questioning things<br>apparently and we have by ethics what<br>kind of young person would be attracted<br>to this program or to try this program<br>um<br>we do have good we do have crossovers<br>with uh philosophy because critical<br>thinking is one of our basic<br>fundamental<br>things<br>so i think it's a a young person<br>who is you know interested in making a<br>mark on the world<br>and perhaps intends to do it<br>uh<br>through<br>um say studying one of the sciences and<br>moving on to create or to help to create<br>drugs or<br>look at new genetic things or work in<br>animal science<br>but<br>who<br>has a conscience<br>and<br>is a critic<br>and actually my experience of<br>school uh students and both my children<br>who are at secondary school at the<br>moment<br>is that that's<br>pretty much all of them potentially<br>of course it's not for everyone but<br>i think they all have the potential to<br>want to ask these questions<br>and find a really good way<br>of answering them<br>that's that's beautiful we have a we<br>have a nice question here from from<br>sally who's asking some fantastic<br>questions thank you sally um this<br>question is a next level for you<br>does economic gain impact on bioethics<br>does economic gain yes impact upon<br>well you might there are different ways<br>you could take this question so uh sally<br>you have to tell me if i'm taking the<br>wrong way so one question one way of<br>taking it might be does it matter<br>if<br>uh<br>if something we propose to do from an<br>ethical point of view does it matter<br>that something we propose to do has an<br>economic gain brings uh say more income<br>into the country or more income to to an<br>industry<br>or so on and so forth and the answer is<br>yes<br>uh to the extent that economic gain<br>represents a benefit<br>benefit is a good<br>and<br>so<br>it gets a thumbs up from that point of<br>view but<br>is the economic gain<br>at the price<br>of something else which we value<br>is it at the price for instance of<br>and then<br>you're really getting into it because<br>you may have<br>one of these<br>clashes where say one human good<br>the benefits say of<br>employment<br>and<br>a richer society is set against another<br>human good<br>maybe the good indeed of other humans or<br>of other living species<br>so the question<br>you know<br>uh<br>goes straight to the heart of the kind<br>of thing<br>we do and you know this is not a voting<br>matter<br>i mean people do vote on these things so<br>that's politic that's political the<br>question is<br>what can you what reasons could you give<br>me<br>to support this<br>maybe economically<br>advantageous<br>uh arrangement<br>and what reasons could you give me<br>against it and which of those reasons<br>are more significant<br>i think that's a<br>great i think that's a great question<br>for us to ponder um and have a think<br>about and thank you very much neil i'm<br>so i just want to take this opportunity<br>to thank all three of our speakers um<br>there was some really great points i<br>learned from everything neil i really<br>love how the way you really summed up<br>bioethics is that's the should questions<br>should we be doing these things yes we<br>can but should we um i love that that<br>mindset around that<br>with our genetics dream
