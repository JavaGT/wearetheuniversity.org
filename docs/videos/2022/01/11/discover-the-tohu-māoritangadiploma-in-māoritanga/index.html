Ko e te tumu <br>ahurei ō Te Herenga Waka.<br>Kia ora my name is Rawinia Higgins and <br>I'm the Deputy Vice-Chancellor Māori here  <br>at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria <br>University of Wellington.<br>The single biggest thing that I took away from <br>the Tohu Māoritanga was being part of a whānau  <br>who were also on the same journey as I was. And <br>we all ended up on different pathways but it  <br>was the beginning of that journey that I think <br>is the thing that kept us together as a whānau  <br>and allowed us to become the <br>people we have become today.<br>Kia ora, ko Ariana Thomson-Lawrence tōku ingoa.  <br>I can't really quite put it into words but <br>it will always be a positive part of my life  <br>and I have nothing but good things to think <br>about my entire time in that entire year.<br>Ko Chris Fox taku ingoa, nō <br>kirikiriroa ahau. I chose to do the  <br>Tohu Māoritanga programme to learn <br>about te ao Māori, the concepts involved, and  <br>one of my passions was within the waka ama space <br>and so I was very interested in learning some  <br>basic te reo as well but more than that the <br>concepts around tikanga, whenua and moana.<br>So the course gave us an opportunity to learn te <br>reo Māori and tikanga Māori and more specifically  <br>apply some of that knowledge in real time at the <br>marae. Through the work that we got to do and the  <br>practical side of Māori culture it gave us that <br>ability to see how our culture was as equally  <br>valued in the university and how it contributed <br>to our qualification for the Tohu Māoritanga.<br>You are taught the skills needed to excel <br>at university but also the tohu connects  <br>you to people that make that life or that <br>experience of university a lot easier.<br>The passion and knowledge that the kaiako have up  <br>at Victoria University in <br>that department is amazing.<br>I love the Tohu Māoritanga. I've been a <br>strong advocate throughout my academic  <br>career because it gave me an opportunity <br>to experience university inside a cohort of  <br>other learners who were in diverse but <br>almost similar backgrounds to myself  <br>and so we were able to support <br>each other we became a whānau  <br>and they've been some of my strongest friends <br>that I've had and friends for life really.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
