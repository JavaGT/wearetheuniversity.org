Businesses have often been the culprits behind this damage, but increasingly today’s business leaders are speaking up and taking steps to improve the sustainability of their company’s products and services.<br>In her Professorial Lecture on 11 October, ‘Will business ever be truly sustainable?’, Professor Eva Collins from the University of Waikato’s Management School will discuss how businesses have engaged with sustainability -- sometimes effectively, and sometimes with negative results.<br>The Professorial Lecture Series introduces the University’s newest professors to the community and gives them a chance to demonstrate how their work is having a real impact on the world around us.<br>Professor Collins is an internationally recognised expert on management and sustainability issues. Her research addresses some of the tensions that exist between traditional business models based on continual economic growth, and sustainability concepts focused on the renewal of scarce natural resources.<br>“It’s still quite controversial to this day for business to play a role in sustainability and biodiversity initiatives, which is pretty crazy when you think about it,” she says.<br>“But in this new era of hyper-transparency, it’s becoming much harder for businesses to hide their environmental and social misdeeds from the public. For example, ignoring your company’s carbon emissions is no longer an option for New Zealand exporters who want to access international markets.”<br>In her talk, Professor Collins will highlight a number of key sustainability trends she expects to see in the business world over the next decade.<br>These include much greater collaboration between industries to share their unique expertise and find practical solutions, increasing government regulation around product stewardship and recycling of waste, and a stronger focus on business sustainability from a holistic or systems perspective.<br>“There is certainly a place for government regulation, but it’s rarely aspirational. So that’s where we need those entrepreneurs and companies who are willing to lean in and find game changers for sustainability by looking at different business models,” she says.<br>"I'm an optimist. Successful businesses change with the needs of the time, and they can do that now - they can help us avoid a climate catastrophe by becoming a more sustainable society. But to be part of that new Renaissance, New Zealand businesses will need to look beyond quarterly earnings statements and the short-term costs of changing their operations."</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

thanks to all<br>the friends family colleagues<br>don't want to cry right at the first<br>slide that doesn't look good but it's<br>awesome to have you and I want to pay a<br>particular acknowledgment to my<br>mother-in-law Marie<br>to my son Finn I am going to cry and to<br>my husband Kevin they've been a huge<br>part of my journey and I've talked to<br>some of you actually just in the foyer<br>and I I think it's worth explaining for<br>just a minute that a professorial<br>lecture is so different from any other<br>kind of academic lecture that we give<br>first off and half of you wouldn't be at<br>one of my academic lectures but it's<br>personal right and I've been given some<br>advice about how to do this lecture<br>from my son 17 year old Finn<br>he said Mom<br>answer the question on your title page<br>and whatever you do don't say it's<br>complicated don't say it depends answer<br>the question people want to know what<br>the answer is<br>so this is for my son Finn<br>the answer<br>is<br>it's a little early to give you the<br>answer but I promise that I'll answer<br>your question<br>so what I would like to talk about<br>tonight is a little bit about my<br>research motivation and to do that I'll<br>talk about my background<br>I'll talk about how I got to wakato<br>management School<br>I'm going to I want to not assume that<br>everybody knows what I'm talking about<br>when I say sustainability so I'm going<br>to give a definition<br>I picked three it was hard I picked<br>three research projects that I've been<br>part of and I'm going to tell you about<br>those<br>and I want to talk about where I see<br>sustainability in with New Zealand<br>businesses going in the future<br>I'm going to wrap it all up by talking<br>about the lessons I've learned and<br>through this through putting this<br>together I realize I've been in this<br>field for 30 years<br>started as a teenager and<br>so<br>where my my research motivation is<br>absolutely starts from where I come from<br>my area is environmental sustainability<br>and it comes from a love of the outdoors<br>I was raised at the beach right on the<br>beach you heard and also camping and<br>fishing was a big part of my life and<br>nature became an important part of who I<br>am and and even what I need<br>so the pictures up there I'm from a big<br>family I am the youngest of five kids<br>the some of all of my siblings are in<br>that photo that's in Redondo Beach I'm<br>blessed with lots of nephews and nieces<br>there's some of them in that photo<br>there's a picture of my mom and I in a<br>kayak in Glacier Bay Alaska which is<br>where she wanted to go when she turned<br>65. you can see where I get some of this<br>from the picture above if you haven't<br>had a chance to meet my mother-in-law is<br>my mother-in-law Marie and Finn and I<br>picked that picture Marie because you<br>kind of look the same height as Finn and<br>I thought you would like that and it<br>also shows your sense of fun the other<br>kayak picture is of my husband and I<br>kayaking Queen Charlotte sound and the<br>picture below is we have a little over<br>40 acres out why narrow Landing so where<br>the wine Arrow river flows into the<br>Raglan Harbor and it's one of the places<br>we try to live our environmental values<br>so we have we're on solar and wind we've<br>planted a hundred fruit trees and I know<br>there's members of forest and bird here<br>tonight they have come out and helped us<br>plant literally thousands of native<br>trees at our batch and on the social<br>side of sustainability we host a music<br>party you can see in the corner of the<br>picture the stage that some of the<br>musicians and our neighbors helped us to<br>build and at the end of summer musicians<br>come<br>and give their their talent freely and<br>people gather and picnic and Camp it's a<br>very cool event and I know that's<br>actually some of those musicians are<br>here in the room tonight as well as some<br>before coming to New Zealand before I<br>immigrated I worked for did government<br>Affairs for 10 years for a company<br>called United Technologies Corporation<br>it's actually it's UTC UTC doesn't exist<br>anymore it's merged and become another<br>big company but when I worked there it<br>was a big company uh 30 billion dollars<br>a year in Revenue people don't know UTC<br>so much but they know the divisions<br>Carrier air conditioning and heating<br>Otis elevators Sikorsky helicopters<br>Pratt and Whitney jet engines<br>International fuel cells big big company<br>and the story of UTC is a story of<br>pretty significant culture change<br>related to environmental sustainability<br>right before I started to work there UTC<br>was fined a big fine<br>it's big enough that it captured the<br>attention of the board of directors and<br>UTC did something really smart they were<br>headquartered in the state of<br>Connecticut<br>and they hired the top regulator in<br>Connecticut to come be their senior vice<br>president of environmental health and<br>safety and Report directly to the to the<br>CEO so she and my boss in the Washington<br>office helped bring this big Corporation<br>from an environmental laggard to an<br>environmental leader<br>just one story from that time<br>we had a list of chemicals we were<br>trying to get out of our production<br>processes and we went to our plant<br>managers and we said here's a list of<br>chemicals we'd like to get them out and<br>the plant manager said couldn't possibly<br>we absolutely need to use those<br>chemicals<br>so UTC did something that was Innovative<br>for the time this was early 1990s I got<br>to be part of it we went to Malaysia did<br>a pilot with our suppliers so we went to<br>our suppliers we showed those suppliers<br>that same list of chemicals<br>now the suppliers are hugely motivated<br>to want to do business with us because<br>we're such a big corporate and they came<br>up with all kinds of innovative ways<br>that we could get those chemicals out of<br>our processes<br>so my time at UTC taught me two<br>important things that have stayed with<br>me one when businesses like UTC with<br>their scale and resources and scope when<br>they decide to adopt sustainability<br>practices it has a huge impact and so I<br>I just got hooked on this notion of<br>business being part of the solution from<br>that time<br>the other thing I learned is some of the<br>best sustainability Solutions come from<br>outside of the firm and in the story I<br>told you about the suppliers<br>the other thing I was doing while I was<br>working for UTC as I was getting a PhD<br>uh in public policy with an<br>environmental Focus<br>I was drawn to the public policy<br>qualification because it was<br>multi-disciplinary so I took Sciences I<br>took environmental law but it was<br>economics based so I come from the<br>environmental community and I felt like<br>economics was used in arguments about<br>the environment to not do things and I<br>wanted to go learn that language so that<br>I could use it for arguments to do<br>things<br>I did my PhD on stakeholder Theory<br>applied to voluntary environmental<br>programs<br>stakeholder theory is creating value for<br>not just shareholders but for all<br>stakeholders<br>and that sounds really<br>obvious now in 2022 but it used to be<br>edgy I used to be edgy and you all have<br>come over to where I've been and now I'm<br>mainstream nevertheless so and I my PhD<br>supervisor is pictured up there<br>Professor Mark sterek he wrote a seminal<br>piece of work in the mid-1990s on who's<br>going to speak for nature during these<br>stakeholder negotiations<br>in my professional life and in my<br>academic life I felt like I was living<br>in two very separate worlds<br>business<br>and environment<br>what did I do<br>did it in my personal life I met and<br>married my partner Kevin Collins so I<br>was a corporate lobbyist and Kevin was<br>an environmental lobbyist one of the<br>biggest environmental groups in the in<br>the states and this true story we met at<br>Congressional hearings on toxic waste<br>sites and if that's not romantic I don't<br>know what is<br>so<br>I I felt like I could have impact at UTC<br>but the story of UTC is a story of a<br>company that<br>didn't want to know until they had this<br>forced Epiphany by the fine and then<br>they adopted practices and there are<br>other stories about companies who along<br>the way Midway<br>get an epiphany of one sort or another<br>and start to adopt practices<br>with my newly minted PhD I was<br>interested to know could we get<br>those business people not Midway but at<br>the beginning could we have business<br>graduates who graduated with that<br>sustainability skill set<br>so it we immigrated to New Zealand and<br>in 2002 I started at wakato management<br>School<br>I have to Define sustainability so for<br>those of you who who know this I'm I<br>just need to do it because<br>sustainability is one of those things<br>that's it's a contested topic right it<br>means a lot of different things to a lot<br>of different people<br>and and the words that get used<br>esgs environmental social government<br>governance U.N sdgs United Nations<br>sustainable development goals they're<br>17.<br>lots of different phrases so what I mean<br>in this talk when I'm talking about<br>business and sustainability is<br>accounting for social cultural<br>environmental and economic impacts of an<br>organization<br>positive and negative both now and in<br>future Generations so future Generations<br>is a really important part of<br>sustainability my own work has most<br>often focused as I said at the beginning<br>about my family on environmental<br>sustainability<br>so I said I was going to talk about<br>three projects this is the first one in<br>2003 wakato management school made<br>sustainability its distinctive Focus way<br>back in 2003 but we realized that we<br>didn't know a lot about what was<br>happening with business and<br>sustainability and my discipline is<br>strategy and in strategy you don't set<br>that forward Direction unless you have a<br>very good understanding of where you are<br>currently so that led to this first<br>piece of work<br>it was a national survey<br>and followed up by qualitative<br>interviews so big National snapshot<br>going followed with in depth and the<br>international literature says that<br>businesses adopt oh I should say too<br>that we didn't use the word<br>sustainability because as I just said no<br>one knew what that word was so in the<br>survey we talked about environmental<br>practices and social practices I think<br>environmental practices are relatively<br>straightforward but just to be clear<br>social practices what we meant by that<br>was how a company treated its workers<br>its employees how a business treated its<br>Community either the local community or<br>the global community<br>so<br>the international literature says that<br>businesses take up these sustainability<br>practices because of consumer pressure<br>or because of the threat of Regulation<br>and that is not what we found when we<br>did the survey so what was driving New<br>Zealand businesses<br>much more about consumer to con business<br>to business pressure not the consumers<br>business to business pressure and also<br>values values of managers values of the<br>founders of the business that played a<br>really big part<br>I want to talk for just a second about<br>the 2010 survey which was after the<br>global financial crisis the GFC and the<br>reason why this one is interesting is<br>because there's two stories that get<br>told pretty much equally about<br>sustainability on the one hand you hear<br>sustainability is a nice to have and as<br>soon as a business hits tough Economic<br>Times like you would in a GFC they're<br>going to ditch the practices<br>but you also hear quite a bit about the<br>business case for sustainability so if a<br>business is becoming more energy<br>efficient and saving money they'll<br>Double Down they'll increase their<br>practices because they're going to save<br>money during a recession<br>so<br>we were the first globally the first<br>research team that had Countrywide Data<br>before the GFC and after the GFC<br>and you know which one was it right I<br>couldn't wait to to see<br>turns out it's both and that there was a<br>sustainability divide so let me let me<br>explain that<br>for businesses that had one or two<br>sustainability practices they dropped<br>them they dropped them during the GFC<br>for businesses particularly members of<br>the sustainable business Network who was<br>our partner in the research<br>and they were these businesses were all<br>in they had multiple practices they<br>increased them so again that that real<br>first time we had seen that in the<br>survey real sustainability divide and<br>when I go back to the question<br>are you paying attention Finn when I go<br>back to the question about<br>um uh will businesses ever truly be<br>sustainable the lesson I took from this<br>body of research is that for businesses<br>to get the True Value out of<br>second research project and this is<br>about<br>case cases so in strategy we use case<br>studies to teach strategy Frameworks and<br>Concepts and when we looked around for<br>business and sustainability cases there<br>were cases at North American you know<br>big corporates nothing that it looked<br>like New Zealand so with my strategy<br>colleagues we collaborated on a series<br>of case studies and this work focuses in<br>particular on ecopreneurs<br>also called<br>sustainability entrepreneurs and what<br>this means is<br>the person starts a business to solve a<br>social and or environmental problem so<br>business isn't the problem business is<br>being used as the solution<br>and the story I'm going to tell you<br>about tonight is Chris Morrison the guy<br>in the middle he has inspired me for<br>years he's what I would call A Serial<br>ecopreneur he started he founded a<br>company called Phoenix Organics drinks<br>and he sold that company and he went on<br>to use that money to start all kinds of<br>other sustainability focused companies<br>and the company that I'm going to talk<br>about today is all good bananas so it<br>turns out that New Zealand is one of the<br>most banana eating countries<br>in the world per capita in the world and<br>that might be the fun fact that you take<br>home with you tonight it's okay that's<br>okay<br>and but we don't commercially grow our<br>own bananas right and so<br>um five new zealanders including Chris<br>Morrison they form all good bananas and<br>they import the company's first fair<br>trade certified bananas so fair trade is<br>a third party certification they go and<br>check that yes these bananas are grown<br>grown with good environmental practices<br>and good social practices because<br>the environmental and labor practices of<br>bananas in general are pretty Grim<br>they're pretty bad and when you know<br>about that you can understand why they<br>wanted to import bananas that that were<br>grown sustainably<br>but their business model was a little<br>bit crazy they were they or were banking<br>on the fact that consumers would pay a<br>dollar more a kilo<br>now that might not sound so<br>revolutionary but bananas are a low-cost<br>commodity product<br>what I mean by that is that most of you<br>I suspect have no idea what brand of<br>banana you buy you buy it because it's<br>yellow or brown or whatever and maybe<br>you also buy it on price and grocery<br>stores know that we're a banana eaten<br>country and we love our bananas so they<br>they use them as a loss leader they put<br>them right at the beginning and they<br>mark them down below cost to get you in<br>the door so in that context charging a<br>dollar more a kilo is pretty tricky and<br>I forgot this part<br>five kiwis<br>up against massive multinational<br>corporations you know they don't stand a<br>chance<br>they used social media to tell their<br>sustainability story it was cheap and<br>you could get a little bit more into the<br>sustainability story and they were very<br>clever with their marketing<br>and they took 10 of the New Zealand<br>banana market and that is huge but it<br>captured the attention of the<br>competitors and Dole you might know Dole<br>multinational corporation they said do<br>you know what<br>our bananas are sustainable too and we<br>just forgot to tell you<br>and we're not going to go through a<br>third party certification who would want<br>to do that but we are going to take the<br>the time to put a green sticker on our<br>bananas and just to make it really clear<br>to the consumers a green tick that says<br>ethical choice<br>because consumers make that banana<br>decision in a nanosecond right they<br>might have heard of all good bananas but<br>then here's Dole right next and it's a<br>green sticker<br>so it started to impact all good sales<br>make a long story short what happened<br>was the NGO Oxfam released a report that<br>talked about the really poor<br>environmental practices and labor<br>practices of Dole bananas there was a<br>Commerce Commission complaint and then<br>Dole<br>voluntarily withdrew their stickers<br>and what if I go back to the question<br>that I asked at the beginning of the<br>presentation about when will businesses<br>ever will businesses ever truly be<br>sustainable what I learned from this<br>body of research is that sustainability<br>last research project that I want to<br>tell you about and it's the one that I'm<br>involved in right now and Neil talked<br>about it in his introduction<br>which was gifted To Us by Professor Tom<br>Roa and it's about a circular economy<br>for the well-being of New Zealand it's<br>five years and it's 11 million dollars<br>and it's led by Professor Kim Pickering<br>she's a materials engineer<br>so if we think of the current state it's<br>often described as linear<br>take make waste we take the resource we<br>need to make what we need and in<br>surprisingly short amount of time it<br>gets thrown away<br>The Ellen MacArthur Foundation who have<br>been thought leaders in this space talk<br>about taking that straight line and make<br>it into a circle by<br>designing out waste and pollution<br>keeping products and materials in use so<br>not thrown away and restoring natural<br>systems and our research project<br>research team is interested in how that<br>can lead to sustainable well-being<br>so there's three parts to a Mio meal I'm<br>going to briefly tell you about the<br>first two parts and talk most about the<br>third part which I'm involved in so the<br>first part is professors Tom Roa Sandy<br>Morrison Les Oxley and they're looking<br>so circular economy there's other places<br>in the world who are trying to implement<br>circular economy that is not new<br>what's new here what what we're trying<br>to do is what does this look like from a<br>New Zealand context the starting point<br>is mataranga Maori it's not the add-in<br>it's where we start what does that look<br>like and then the objective is not zero<br>waste it's sustainable well-being and<br>that's what the first group of the<br>project is working on<br>the second group is led by the principal<br>investigator Kim Pickering and um<br>I don't see her here if she was here and<br>she was listening she might have a smile<br>on her face and say how is Eva going to<br>explain biod Drive polymers and fibers<br>but I'm not I'm not going to go down<br>that rabbit hole<br>instead I'm going to give you a couple<br>cool examples about what this team is<br>doing<br>so one thing they're looking at is the<br>um underneath of sheep where it gets<br>really dirty is a waste product and it<br>turns out that that fiber is a really<br>good material for jib and we've read in<br>the newspaper how short of jib we are so<br>they're taking a waste product and<br>turning it into a value add<br>this is a news article from last year<br>that's picture of Kim in her lab and<br>this was a newspaper article about<br>muscle muscle shells being used as<br>I'm in the third stream I've put the<br>scope of work up on the slide and it's<br>co-led with Professor Barry Barton and<br>myself and the part that I'm involved in<br>is Neil mentioned in his<br>introduction go circular 2025. go<br>circular 2025 the partners include so<br>it's led by SBN Emil Mio is a partner<br>New Zealand trade and Enterprise<br>Ministry for environment waste<br>minimization Auckland Council<br>has lots of different pieces but I'm<br>going to mostly talk about the directory<br>so what we heard from businesses is that<br>they they were interested in circularity<br>but they didn't know where to go for<br>businesses who could be who could Supply<br>circular Solutions so just this year we<br>launched New Zealand's first business to<br>business platform on circular economy<br>there's it's early days but it's pretty<br>cool over 300 circular Solutions super<br>good engagement with the website<br>and um<br>I've been part of the team at the coal<br>face that has looked at each application<br>for the directory to see if it meets<br>circular criteria and one of my big<br>learnings from this piece of work is how<br>often businesses make claims without<br>evidence so that's probably when where<br>we had to go back the most but a cool<br>story from this work is a packaging<br>company<br>put in an application and got rejected<br>didn't meet the criteria they went away<br>and then they came back and they came<br>back and they said we did a critical<br>review of our offerings and we got rid<br>of single-use plastic we got rid of<br>non-recyclable plastic and they got<br>listed so<br>when I look think about the question at<br>the beginning of my presentation<br>what I learned from this piece of work<br>is that that business to business I<br>wouldn't call it pressure I would call<br>it more cooperation collaboration is<br>where some transformational activity can<br>happen<br>I picked three<br>that I want to highlight of where I<br>think sustainability and business is<br>going in New Zealand<br>the first gives me a lot of Hope because<br>whenever money is involved things happen<br>quickly and on an example of sustainable<br>investment just last week I got an email<br>from my kiwisaver and they said we're<br>moving your funds to more sustainable<br>funds<br>an example of insurance so I think of<br>the people in Florida I think if they're<br>trying if they're wanting to rebuild<br>their homes wanting to rebuild their<br>businesses after the hurricane that if<br>they're not able to get insurance that's<br>going to impact where they rebuild<br>probably faster than the managed Retreat<br>that we're doing here in this country<br>the second one is about technology and I<br>almost didn't put this on because I do<br>think that we try to Tech our way out of<br>problems with without dealing with the<br>fundamental issues<br>but technology is fundamentally going to<br>change what happens here my recent<br>Master's student Catherine Mitchell just<br>finished her thesis<br>co-supervised by Professor Albert Buffet<br>the director of our own artificial<br>Institute artificial intelligence<br>Institute Catherine looked at<br>how New Zealand businesses were using AI<br>in their environmental strategies<br>sustainability strategies and what she<br>found was that there's some cool things<br>happening but it's not quite reached<br>critical mass but it's coming it's close<br>it's coming<br>the last one I want to talk about is the<br>youth that's a picture of Finn when he<br>was shorter at one of the high school<br>marches climate change marches<br>our young people do not think that<br>climate change is an existential threat<br>because they're living with the impact<br>of climate change right now and they're<br>demanding change and that's important<br>for us because as a university these are<br>our students and as employers these are<br>your employees who are going to come and<br>ask what that organization is doing<br>related to climate change<br>the wrap up so after 30 years in this<br>business what have I learned<br>right from my PhD<br>I<br>realized that multidisciplinary is the<br>way to go on these things right it's how<br>we're operating in a meal meal but it's<br>why I'm so proud of the University of<br>wakato's new Bachelor of climate change<br>it is absolutely the way we should be<br>doing this and I'm super excited about<br>um stakeholder engagement Consulting<br>with stakeholders is morphing into<br>collaboration with stakeholders and I<br>put a screenshot of a report that a<br>commissioned report I did last year for<br>the sustainable Business Council<br>they brought together members of the<br>heavy transport sector including end<br>users these folks had never talked to<br>each other<br>before together in a room to collaborate<br>to come up with low carbon Solutions so<br>SBC did a report on those low carbon<br>Solutions and my report was documenting<br>that collaboration and again that<br>business to business interaction is<br>where big change is starting to happen<br>back to the sustainability survey so<br>what I learned is that it has to be<br>embedded I would like to see<br>sustainability managers made redundant<br>we don't have profitability managers<br>it's just part of what is considered<br>necessary and fundamental to business<br>from the banana case<br>absolutely again I'm focused on the<br>non-incremental because<br>um we CA we don't have time to celebrate<br>the incremental we've got to go quicker<br>and how we're going to go quicker is<br>again I talked about this a couple of<br>times during the talk that evidence is<br>required I put up a recent example<br>though because it just killed me<br>Coca-Cola just recently did this big ad<br>campaign our new bottles our new plastic<br>bottles are made of 25<br>Marine bound plastic Marine bound<br>plastic it's a thing<br>what they don't say is that they are the<br>world's largest producer of plastic so<br>they had no credibility for that<br>campaign<br>the last one that I put in isn't<br>directly related to the research that<br>I've talked about tonight but it's an<br>additional observation that I wanted to<br>share<br>and that is<br>what a business did yesterday what it's<br>doing today may not be okay tomorrow and<br>I put rod car picture of Rod Car the<br>climate change commissioner up there he<br>just recently said New Zealand's<br>emissions trading scheme<br>is giving companies the license to plant<br>to pollute<br>and what that means is that what what<br>he's referring to is the growing<br>skepticism about offsets because offsets<br>don't deal with the fundamental<br>change that we need so fly all you want<br>just plant a tree and that's still okay<br>today probably it's going to be okay<br>tomorrow<br>but I suspect pretty soon two years<br>three years maybe sooner it won't be<br>okay<br>so I want to end with my last story and<br>this is a recent story<br>I'm practicing this talk in front of my<br>partner Kevin and I get to this part and<br>just in case you've missed it this is<br>the high drama part of the talk I've<br>been building to it the whole talk<br>referring back this is the time<br>and I say to Kevin<br>let me get<br>I say<br>this is for my son Finn<br>the answer<br>is yes<br>yes and it will take business engaging<br>in sustainability most businesses in a<br>way that they haven't so far<br>and Kevin so good Strong finish yes and<br>it's positive it's good I Circle back to<br>fins all good and Kevin says<br>he said if you say if you say that<br>immediately the question that I have is<br>why why now you have to answer why now<br>we haven't got there up until this point<br>so why in the world thinking I'm wrong<br>that you would think that why now<br>and I did kind of think have you not<br>been listening to the last 40 minutes<br>I've been talking about where you sleep<br>indoor in my practice but then I thought<br>that maybe you all would have the same<br>question right now and you walk out to<br>the foyer and you say oh<br>she did okay but she didn't really<br>answer that question very well<br>so it's yes<br>and<br>because of Technology not contradicting<br>myself I don't think technology will<br>save us but I do I've been hanging out<br>with Albert in the AI Institute I think<br>there's some cool stuff coming so<br>because of Technology<br>it's yes because that business to<br>business collaboration pressure whatever<br>you're talking about is growing and I'm<br>getting<br>Hope from what I'm seeing<br>this country doesn't have just one Chris<br>Morrison we're actually really good at<br>creating and nurturing the Chris<br>Morrison's of this country and places<br>like wakato management school is getting<br>better at training those business people<br>before they go out not the Midway but<br>from the start having the sustainability<br>skill set<br>it's yes because the young people are<br>out marching and demanding change<br>finally it's yes because<br>people like me<br>are not going away<br>even after I leave Academia I'm going to<br>be talking about and advocating that<br>business and sustainability are one<br>thank you<br>as we sat down in the seats just before<br>the lecture began<br>Eva looked around the room and I was<br>standing outside in the four year<br>earlier and she said gosh there are so<br>many<br>so many faces so many people from<br>different parts of my life<br>they've all come together you know it's<br>a little bit like a wedding<br>and I thought I know you met at a toxic<br>waste hearing and so I don't know what<br>your wedding was like maybe maybe this<br>is what you did uh<br>but thank you Eva for that when I uh<br>listened to that and also working with<br>you over the last couple of years what's<br>clear when you think about anybody's<br>work there's what people do and there's<br>also how they do it so if you go right<br>back to your PhD the involvement of<br>stakeholders one thing that marks you<br>out in the how of your work is the way<br>that you collaborate and the way that<br>you bring people with you whether that's<br>in your role as associate Dean research<br>whether it's the acknowledgments your<br>family to Marie Kevin and Finn in the<br>room to your colleagues it's really<br>striking the degree to which you see<br>yourself as part of a network of people<br>and when I look at the research that<br>you've been doing<br>you have a unique ability to engage to<br>entertain but in the service of a higher<br>a higher purpose so it's really it's<br>amazing to see the way that you connect<br>people and ideas to have impact so we've<br>had a real treat tonight and I'm sure<br>you'll all join me in thanking Professor<br>Eva Collins once more</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
