They are also at the forefront of climate change impacts. The accumulating effects of multiple stressors are of concern because synergistic interactions can give rise to ecological surprise or tipping points and a loss of ecosystem functions and services. <br><br>Unfortunately, ecological responses to cumulative effects can lag behind the cause(s) and are often not apparent until a threshold has been crossed. In the coastal marine zone cumulative effect management is particularly difficult because of the diffuse, chronic nature of many stressors (sediment, nutrient inputs), ecological feedbacks that create response lags and water movements that connect habitats at multiple spatial and temporal scales. <br><br>In this seminar I will overview findings from a national-scale field experiment conducted at 22 sites in 15 estuaries aimed at better understanding how sediment and nutrient runoff from land erode resilience, making them prone to tipping points. These results will be contextualised with research currently underway aimed at better understanding how these stressors may interact with sea level rise to affect coastal productivity."</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>just when you finish we want to make<br>sure that we<br>you don't log up too quickly because I<br>that's what I'm projecting that's good<br>foreign<br>yeah<br>that's right and yeah not not better<br>get some approaches with expressing<br>interests by having a<br>I I I I I know what they would do yeah<br>yeah<br>do I need to wear a bike for this or the<br>blood test<br>um I think it may be better if you wear<br>this is<br>okay<br>it's kind of like half a tree falls in<br>the forest and I went there to hear it<br>so there's my lecturing experience<br>yesterday um yeah<br>foreign<br>volunteer to give a seminar that I<br>um<br>foreign<br>any of the shirts do you enter<br>no it's got 15 of those credits<br>Tuesday<br>foreign<br>probably to explain<br>it yeah<br>I'll switch it up that's all right now I<br>switched it off I just had some Widow<br>inside now yeah I know it's so screwed<br>right now yes sir<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>okay<br>all right just<br>some schedules<br>yeah okay we might as well get started<br>um<br>everybody should know me and comrade but<br>I'm the academic co-director of the<br>people<br>which is the Environmental Research<br>Institute it is my pleasure today to<br>introduce Professor Conrad at hillbitch<br>I'm he's a professor within the School<br>of Science and academic team leader uh<br>and he is a marine scientist with a<br>specialization in coastal benthic marine<br>ecosystems and he has been working a lot<br>on both natural and anthropogenic change<br>and what those uh what the impact of<br>those changes are to our Coastal<br>ecosystems so today he will give us a<br>talk on the erosion of resilience in<br>coastal ecosystems<br>everybody<br>um thanks for the introduction Charlie<br>and thank you for attending the guys<br>that are online and also uh those that<br>are live here in Hamilton and appreciate<br>having an audio that's certainly better<br>than I've been doing in most of my<br>lectures lately so I wouldn't have taken<br>it personally if no one had shown up so<br>thank you all for being here and thank<br>you for the opportunity to share a<br>little bit of the research that we've<br>been involved whether I've been involved<br>with over the last couple of years it's<br>been a good opportunity to bring some of<br>this together and and share some of the<br>findings with you<br>um I kind of uh need to acknowledge a<br>whole lot of people I want to do this<br>first in case I run out of time and um<br>this has certainly been a team effort um<br>and it's involved a lot of people and I<br>just want to highlight a couple of<br>really key people who's uh we've been<br>working with for a long period of time<br>now on this kind of stuff and have<br>contributed perhaps most although there<br>are many more that have contributed in<br>other ways as well and these are Rebecca<br>Gladstone Gallagher she was the postdoc<br>with us for a couple of years is<br>formerly a PhD student in and out the<br>University of Auckland Johanna Carmel<br>who has just finished at postdoc here on<br>this project he's gone back to the<br>University of Helsinki and then I'm Judy<br>Hewitt and Simon's Rush at the<br>University of Auckland and a couple of<br>PhD students who have contributed an<br>awful lot to what I'm going to talk<br>about today reading between the lines is<br>mostly their work that Steph Mangan<br>Who's down at me were in Christchurch<br>now in uh Georgina flowers who's a PhD<br>student with us currently<br>okay so with that oh and of course I<br>need to acknowledge um the National<br>Science challenge sustainable seas that<br>have funded the locals what I'm going to<br>talk about today<br>so if we think about our Coastline<br>environments we have some 300 plus<br>histories scattered along with the<br>coastline<br>now these histories are highly diverse<br>environments they range from Wetlands<br>around river valleys to the coastal<br>embodiments that are kind of<br>characterize statistic types that we<br>have here and of course all the way down<br>into the southern fuel area which are<br>actually estuaries as well now these<br>estuaries are characterized by a<br>um<br>Supply regions of very very high<br>productivity they have because they're<br>close to where people live in many cases<br>I think 24 about 25 cities are on the<br>coast and most of those are based around<br>Australian environments and they're<br>based and people have been connected<br>with with estuaries for Millennia they<br>have high cultural values today<br>recreational food harvesting sources<br>their intrinsic ecosystems that support<br>a lot of biodiversity and a lot of<br>productivity and of course they're the<br>centers of Commerce for a lot of our<br>large cities places like tomoki makata<br>Auckland and Tauranga Harbor big<br>commercial centers based on histories<br>and that's reflected<br>um globally where most a lot of the<br>large industrial areas are focused on<br>these histories<br>now<br>um these histories have an immense<br>amount of value to people but it's<br>underpinned by being a very productive<br>ecosystem versus almost so the sea floor<br>in our estuaries which is where most of<br>the biomass and most of the productivity<br>occurs contains 90 of the biomass that<br>we find in histories and this is just a<br>photograph of one of the estuaries up<br>north of Auckland the whangati our<br>Harbor<br>so if we look at these histories they're<br>very productive if we look at dense area<br>shellfish Beds which you can see in this<br>Photograph here they actually are<br>represented lost Charlie<br>sounds<br>closing okay too loud it's usually a<br>first case so these um intertidal sand<br>plants that we can see here actually<br>contain productive shellfish beds mainly<br>ostravenous Dutch brewery in this case<br>small clam that feeds and lives just<br>beneath the sediment surface so in a<br>typical area on the sand flat would be<br>the shellfish beds it all contain 80 000<br>kilograms of shellfish bioness so that's<br>a lot of animal biomass if we compare<br>that to an average dairy farm here in<br>New Zealand that will support about 2<br>000 kilograms of cow per year so there's<br>a multiplier of 40 added on to the<br>amount of animal biomass that these<br>intertidal habitats can<br>maintain and produce and there's no<br>added nitrogen or fertilizer to these<br>systems it's all relatively natural so<br>they're incredibly unproductive<br>ecosystems and at the heart of that<br>ecosystem is a hidden garden and The<br>Hidden Garden is<br>of microphyte have been fossil which are<br>small single or multicellular<br>phytoplankton that live associated with<br>the sediments so this is this green<br>tinge that you can see on the sediment<br>surface here that's composed primarily<br>of diatoms which are small single-celled<br>phytoplankton they're attached to the<br>sediment surface is a scanning electron<br>micrographic lunges here so these<br>systems are so productive for two<br>reasons one is abundance of life it's<br>hitting that sediment surface so that<br>can sustain high production and the<br>second is an abundance of nutrients<br>primarily nitrogen and they're situated<br>at the sediment surface not on the water<br>column in many of New Zealand gestures<br>because the nutrients are stored in the<br>filaments so there's an abundance of<br>nitrogen being regenerated by the<br>bacteria in those sediments that<br>supplies lots of ammonia back up towards<br>the surface and it's trapped there at<br>that layer by the microfit opinthos<br>now these diatoms are naturally High<br>polyunsaturated fats and lipids and<br>proteins which makes the conversion of<br>that plant material into animal biomass<br>very very efficient and that transfer<br>occurs through the invertebrate<br>Community that's hanging out in the<br>sediments the clams the shrimps the<br>crabs the whelks all of those animals<br>the polychics are either eating directly<br>on that microfight of benthos or feeding<br>on the animals that are feeding on that<br>microfighter pimples so it's a very<br>efficient transfer because of their<br>energy is nicely packaged it's high in<br>protein high in lipids up into animal<br>biomass and then finally up into the<br>charismatic megafauna that many people<br>associate through those histories so<br>it's that food source really is why the<br>animal biomass can be so much higher<br>than estuaries than it is in terrestrial<br>systems you don't need seven stomachs<br>and multiple different sorts of bacteria<br>to convert cellulose into animal biomass<br>so these histories I'm going to come<br>back to these food webs and these<br>interactions between animals that live<br>in these sediments and the productivity<br>of these systems because that underpins<br>the functionality in the services that<br>we provide for this Coastal environments<br>now histories are probably the most<br>contested space that we have they're<br>subjected to multiple stresses and those<br>stresses can either originate on land or<br>in the sea or increasingly at Global<br>scales<br>so from Land the histories of the<br>receiving environments of contaminants<br>that run off their terrestrial<br>ecosystems that things like nutrients<br>things like sediments or land use<br>management but there may be Point<br>sources associated with urban areas such<br>as wastewater treatment plants and also<br>the contaminants heavy metals that run<br>off our roads than off our cities into<br>these environments there's also stresses<br>that originate in the sea some of our<br>larger histories have aquaculture<br>operations maybe adding organic methods<br>to the sediments fishing either in the<br>estuaries or on the open Coast can<br>impact those ecosystems as well<br>occasionally we have the odd ship<br>running ground and deposit oil into our<br>Estrada systems as well<br>many of our larger histories especially<br>those associated with the human<br>populations undergone a lot of<br>hydrological re-engineering dredging for<br>shipping channels and all of those can<br>alter the hydrography and put stress on<br>the ecosystem and of course increasingly<br>we're living in a warming world and a<br>more acidified ocean as well which adds<br>into that system<br>now why we're concerned about these<br>multiple stresses is that they often<br>interact in non-editive ways this means<br>that if we have stress a and stress of B<br>occurring in the same place at the same<br>time the effect on the ecosystem may be<br>multiplicative and not additive and a<br>lot of these stresses is particularly<br>the land runoff ones are the few<br>stresses that operate over very long<br>temporal scales and very large spatial<br>scales so understanding their effects on<br>how they affect those ecosystems is<br>particularly challenging what we do know<br>is that these cumulative effects and<br>multiple stresses can lead to tipping<br>points and this represents these rapid<br>changes in state and structure and often<br>come as a surprise into managers and<br>surprises to society we often know when<br>we've passed a Tipping Point and ended<br>up in a degraded state from a relatively<br>pristine Estuary like this one here one<br>that may be dominated by mud flats with<br>lower um values and services and<br>productivity<br>so these cumulative stresses and the<br>kind of effects of these multiple<br>stresses begins to erode resilience in<br>these systems and what makes that makes<br>them vulnerable to these rapid State<br>changes so often a small effect can have<br>devastating consequences and these<br>changes these State changes are often<br>only apparent when you're sitting back<br>down here at the bottom of the cliff<br>looking back up and then oh that's<br>obvious for what was happening<br>so there's plenty of theory around how<br>this state changes here how what<br>triggers these State changes is a lot of<br>computer modeling being done on these<br>kinds of things but getting outside and<br>demonstrating this empirically is often<br>a much more challenging task we don't<br>want to avoid these tapping points<br>because when we transgress them getting<br>back to that original state is<br>particularly difficult because of the<br>hysteresis involved in the system so we<br>now may be able to manage the stresses<br>turn off the Taps but just by doing that<br>because of the Legacy effects of these<br>stresses the system may not return back<br>to that state even though we've managed<br>the initial the horses<br>so there's real value in kind of<br>removing our way from these theoretical<br>ideas of tipping points<br>um to actually getting outside and<br>thinking at scale about how these<br>stresses and direct and providing<br>empirical evidence and actual effects<br>and erosion of resilience we don't want<br>to be end up down here saying we told<br>you so we'd want to be back and be able<br>to provide advice and evidence that<br>these things are real and occurring<br>so the projects that we've been running<br>within the sustainable Seas has been<br>about Gathering the empirical evidence<br>and it's been about Gathering empirical<br>evidence at scale so something that's<br>generalizable across the country so not<br>necessarily just working in one place<br>and at one time but increasing the scale<br>over which we're running these studies<br>for these experiments I'm going to focus<br>most of what I want to talk to today<br>about is on this tipping points<br>experiment<br>so we chose um two stresses to have a<br>look at a lot of Empirical research<br>today often involves stress and<br>isolation we look at stressor a it's<br>impact and then stress of B and try and<br>make some some statements about how<br>these things are going to interact so we<br>chose um two stresses to work on<br>probably the two most difficult but also<br>probably the two most important at least<br>in a New Zealand context<br>so we focused on the effects of<br>sediments and all the effects of<br>nutrients as two key stresses so here in<br>ayatira New Zealand we do a really good<br>job of pumping a lot of sediment into<br>the coastal zone this Photograph here on<br>your left is a photographical manner of<br>two after a rainfall event in the<br>Wellington region a number of years ago<br>you can see the vast amounts of erosion<br>that have occurred during that rain<br>event and then several days later the<br>satellite imagery of the lower North<br>Island showing the results of that<br>rainfall event in the in the National<br>Zone you can see the high levels of<br>turbidity or suspended sediments<br>occupying that Nearshore region<br>so that's of concern because as We Know<br>The Hidden Garden likes lots of light at<br>the seafood so adding that suspended<br>sediment into the system reduces the<br>amount of light availability the sea<br>floor that's the base of the food chain<br>consequences through the ecosystem<br>before that so we've done a really good<br>job about upping the amount of sediments<br>we delivered to the coastal zone<br>currently we occupy about point zero<br>five percent of the land surface area on<br>the planet but contribute 40 times that<br>loading so that our sediment loads into<br>the system so we deliver about 20 times<br>10 to 9 tons per year that's a lot of<br>sediment now that's some of that's<br>natural we have steep Landscapes we live<br>in the Westerly wind belts we have a lot<br>of rain we have highly erodible soils<br>especially in the Eastern parts of the<br>North Island volcanic soils so all of<br>them predisposed for a lot of sediment<br>coming into the system catchments are<br>short when it rains the city elements<br>arrive in the coastal zone fairly<br>quickly but our land use choices have<br>greatly contributed to that so recent<br>study looking at sedimentation rates in<br>many New Zealand histories has<br>demonstrated quite clearly an order of<br>magnitude increase in sedimentation and<br>histories since European colonization<br>and that really really hasn't baited<br>the other stressor that's been growing<br>um<br>a lot over the last kind of several<br>decades is the intensification of<br>Agriculture on our land and there's many<br>in this ER Research Institute who can<br>talk to that much better than I can but<br>the simple graph here just shows the<br>increase in the dairy herd size or the<br>number of cows in New Zealand and since<br>the 70s which is around 3 million to<br>over 6 million um cows to uh cows on the<br>land<br>um today now given that each cow<br>produces about the same influent as 20<br>people you know that's a a 60 million<br>people we have on the land effectively<br>and of course there's the added<br>nutrients that are needed to keep the<br>grass growing to feed the cows that milk<br>production so some of those nutrients<br>eventually end up in our waterways and<br>eventually make their way armed down to<br>the coast so these stresses are<br>difficult to deal with at scale they're<br>diffuse they come in episodically and<br>it's a very difficult system if we want<br>to manage or experiment with this we'll<br>do Empirical research research how do we<br>know I'm setting up a study that'll<br>so this was the Tipping points<br>experiment that we've set up and we<br>worked across 15 estuaries in New<br>Zealand so we're trying to look at<br>before we fell off a cliff before we're<br>in a really degraded State we do have<br>some histories in New Zealand that have<br>passed tipping points so now eutrified<br>or filled with mud but the estuaries we<br>selected are all kind of relatively<br>pristine state so we're working back at<br>the start of that place before the<br>system actually fell off a cliff we<br>entered into a degraded state<br>so these sites were selected along a<br>turbidity a gradient where we used our<br>effective knowledge of the estuaries<br>we're working in and the time we've<br>spent working them to pick sites that<br>were relatively clear<br>um histories that didn't have a lot of<br>suspended sediments in them and those<br>that had more suspended sediment lights<br>the communities of animals and the<br>sediments were relatively similar they<br>had two key bivalve species in there a<br>clam and a deposit feeding Ridge shell<br>and we went into these systems and<br>manipulated the amount of nutrients that<br>were in the sediments and we did that<br>simply by adding fertilizer at depth to<br>simulate a higher nutrient blade so we<br>had a gradient in turbidity which we<br>went in and then manipulated the amount<br>of nutrients in the sediments and then<br>blocked the effects that it had on the<br>ecosystem so we set this experiment up<br>at all these sites cast of thousands<br>like hundreds and hundreds of holes and<br>sand Flats to add the fertilizer and<br>then<br>um nine months later we went back with<br>our benfic Chambers which are these sort<br>of incubation Chambers we place over the<br>sediment water interface and we can use<br>that to measure a lot of fluxes and<br>exchange of solutes between the water<br>column and the sediments we could<br>measure things like denitrification<br>rates we could measure primary<br>production we can measure the<br>Regeneration of the nutrients and the<br>consumption of oxygen in these sediments<br>all indicators of how the system is<br>function again and we also sampled the<br>sediments for the macro formal diversity<br>and how the stress of turbidity and how<br>the nutrient additions altered that<br>biodiversity which could then link back<br>into the functioning of these systems<br>so with some data um looking at the<br>light levels in these Harbors that we<br>went through and you can see although<br>there's a lot of variability we can see<br>we did achieve a gradient across these<br>22 sites we had in the history some<br>histories had very very low light levels<br>this is where others and even heathcote<br>in Tauranga had had reasonably high or<br>light levels within the system so we<br>achieved a nice gradient positivity<br>across these 22 sites which was good<br>because that was half of our experiment<br>so the next thing is how did the<br>nutrients stress into these systems<br>begin to change how these systems<br>function<br>so what I've got on this next slide here<br>is an ecological interaction Network and<br>so what this does is it represents<br>a a map if you like or a summary of how<br>we think these soft sediment ecosystems<br>are functioning and working that<br>interaction network is based on about 20<br>years of research looking at different<br>components of this and how to fix the<br>system<br>so we have parts of the system that are<br>environmental this is our nutrient<br>addition here sediment temperature<br>because we're working from Northland to<br>Southland the amount of light<br>attenuation turbidities in here these<br>are our primary producers there's some<br>properties of the sediment through here<br>and then these components ostravenous<br>and nakamona there are two dominant<br>shellfish species within the system and<br>then we've got some measures of nutrient<br>processing in these orange boxes which<br>represent ammonium flux and also<br>denitrification now the details of this<br>really really aren't important it's just<br>a summary of how we think things are<br>connected and how things think that how<br>we think things of work and how we think<br>things work and so what we're interested<br>in then is if we take our measures of<br>ecosystem function and have a look at<br>how that interaction network is going to<br>change under under turbidity stress so<br>we can run some boosted regression tree<br>analyzes which can split our sites based<br>on turbidity into clear estuaries and<br>into two turbot histories and we can<br>have a look at how that interaction<br>Network begins to change<br>so if we're thinking about the the<br>interaction Network we can see on the<br>left hand side we've got our clear<br>Estuary so this is estuaries that on<br>average at greater than 420 micro molar<br>per meter squared of photons hitting it<br>and our more turbot histories Which is<br>less than um 350. I want you to remember<br>these numbers because I'm going to come<br>back to these towards the end of the<br>score so it's a clear break point in<br>those ecological interaction networks<br>around light levels in these districts<br>so again I don't want you to get bogged<br>down in details I just want you to<br>visually have a look at how those<br>interaction networks have shifted so in<br>clear estuaries you can see a there's a<br>lot of connections there's strong<br>connections indicated by the solid lines<br>there's weaker connections within the<br>system indicated by the dotted lines<br>there's positive effects and there's<br>negative effects it's wired<br>if we compare that to the more turbid<br>systems you can see that interaction<br>network is simplified considerably<br>there's a few direct strong interactions<br>but the nutrient addition is now<br>decoupled from that interaction network<br>uh where it's connected in the other one<br>and so if you're thinking about Network<br>Theory when you simplify Networks<br>and you reduce the number of Pathways<br>and number of feedbacks and alternative<br>paths you're reducing resilience in<br>these systems and cope with further<br>stress I kind of like to think of this<br>picture maybe as the first one<br>pre-covered transport networks down in<br>New Zealand you know we had many ships<br>coming from different parts of the world<br>of one shipping route kind of fell over<br>then there's another way in which to get<br>our Goods in and out of the country post<br>covert now close Ukraine well in the<br>middle of a war in Europe those networks<br>have been dramatically reduced were<br>dependent on a few key connections and<br>something happens to that we're isolated<br>and similar in the ecosystems if we're<br>simplifying those networks the ability<br>to absorb stress the ability to find<br>different Pathways around it and now<br>impacted so this provides some really<br>nice evidence in systems that are<br>stressed by turbidity their ability to<br>process those nutrients is reduced and<br>we've also got within our system a whole<br>lot of biodiversity and if we think<br>about just taking a simple core from the<br>sand flat it may have 30 or 40 species<br>in it across a area the size of this<br>room we may have 120 different species<br>of macro formula now these things are<br>you know they look like worms and crabs<br>which they are but they carry out<br>functions and they're really really<br>important to the system because these<br>little guys that are moving through<br>their behavior whether they're feeding<br>within the moving sediment up or down<br>whether they're irrigating Burrows all<br>affect those key microbial processes the<br>Regeneration of nutrients fuels the<br>primary production and the availability<br>of oxygen within lucidoma so these<br>macrophauna play a really important role<br>through their mixing and their feeding<br>processes and so we're interested in<br>having a look at how these stresses that<br>we place into the system across this<br>large scale of New Zealand how they are<br>influencing the biodiversity and could<br>we relate that back to some measures of<br>ecosystem function<br>so again collapsing a whole lot of work<br>down it's in very very simple graphs we<br>found that out to Bitter tea and this<br>again we separated this into three<br>different light levels now we have our<br>clear Estuary over here our moderately<br>turbid group here and our turbid group<br>which had less than 350 micro model<br>photons per liter squared per second out<br>there so this is just simply a very<br>simple measure of diversity it's just<br>the number of species we had in the core<br>and we can see as we went from the clear<br>to the moderate moderately turbid in the<br>two but it does a slight increase in the<br>number of species that we're firing okay<br>so we had slightly more species we found<br>in these moderately turbot and these<br>turbid systems we also found that as we<br>added nutrient stress to these systems<br>there's a negative effect on that<br>biodiversity particularly in the high<br>levels of<br>urea addition we've dropped the<br>diversity down from about 22 species per<br>core down to 16. you see what I mean or<br>something so we're knocking species out<br>with that nutrient addition there's no<br>interaction<br>um effect on that on the species<br>richness and so<br>um we want to now know how that was<br>going to impact on the multi-function on<br>the multi-functionality of the system so<br>I've got here as a<br>find a summary of the sort of key uh key<br>findings from this analysis so we<br>calculated a multi-functionality index<br>again the details really aren't that<br>important but we took several measures<br>of ecosystem functioning those rates of<br>primary production how fast carbon was<br>being re-mineralized in the system the<br>amount of chlorophyll primary producer<br>biomass in the system so we combine that<br>into one Matrix which was to give us an<br>idea of how well the system is<br>functioning and then we looked at the<br>relationship between the number of<br>species that we're finding and that<br>particular index so what you can take<br>away in this in this and that those<br>numbers of species were being reduced<br>down in these systems by increasing<br>nutrient stress which we added into the<br>system so what you can see very clearly<br>in the moderately two bit and our turbot<br>sites is that as that system became<br>stressed we were losing species and as a<br>consequence of that loss of species we<br>were losing functionality within that<br>ecosystem yes this is data taken from 22<br>sites across the whole link of New<br>Zealand to build this relationship so<br>the generality of it I think is pretty<br>reasonable and it's no surprising there<br>we all know that biodiversity under its<br>function if we lose biodiversity then<br>we're going to lose functionality the<br>interesting thing was in the clear<br>estuaries we found no relationship<br>between the loss of biodiversity and a<br>decrease in multi-functionality that was<br>resilient to biodiversity loss so as we<br>stress the system with turbidity as we<br>lose species due to nutrient stress then<br>we saw our loss in functionality and the<br>clearer systems that loss of species as<br>we knock species out didn't have an<br>impact on that multi-functionality index<br>which was kind of interesting<br>so getting back to our our species again<br>the thing about it is is this this<br>resilience in the clearestries is<br>probably due to some level of redundancy<br>so when we look at species we see<br>multiple different species in this thing<br>but when we start thinking about the<br>traits that these animals have they<br>share certain functional traits for<br>example the worms that we may see here<br>move through and buy it to bait sediment<br>so they share the same functional trait<br>so functionally if you lose one species<br>it could be replaced with a role that<br>that worm was playing and maintaining<br>functionality may be replaced by another<br>so you have some measure of resilience<br>right there's different species but<br>doing the same jobs<br>so if you have high levels of functional<br>diversity then maybe you can begin to<br>lose species and not impact upon that<br>upon that system<br>so we can classify these animals not in<br>terms of whether they're species but we<br>can characterize the community in terms<br>of its functional traits and we can<br>characterize this the community in terms<br>of its functional traits through its<br>contribution to the ecosystem function<br>so these are the things that the animals<br>are doing to maintain the functionality<br>and the productivity the nutrient<br>regeneration and supporting the<br>microfiber the influence but we could<br>also think about traits that provide<br>response diversity which is how it deals<br>with stress okay so these are traits<br>that are related to the resistance to<br>stress so if they're hard body they may<br>not be crushed if they have a high<br>occupancy in the landscape which means<br>they can recolonize space that's a<br>resistance case and we can think about<br>recovery traits depending on how they<br>move around how mobile they are what<br>sort of larval phase they have so we can<br>classify<br>the traits that this these communities<br>have into regulating traits so that's<br>the traits that give you regulating<br>functions so restore functionality to<br>systems and redundancy and then we can<br>think about response diversity traits<br>which are the set of traits that provide<br>resilience to Future disturbances or<br>other stresses okay so we can separate<br>up those so we can go through each of<br>these species and characterize them and<br>characterize the community in terms of<br>the regulating traits and their response<br>diversity traits<br>okay hopefully people are still with me<br>then we can begin to think about how<br>these networks are changed with stress<br>okay and trust me this isn't me just<br>with a line drawing things between dots<br>this is the results of of a network<br>analysis um that Rebecca conducted on<br>this data set so we may have regulating<br>trait a so that might be that's a deep<br>burrowing species okay that regenerates<br>nutrients we might have a response<br>diversity trait a which may be it has a<br>high occupancy in the landscape and a<br>species she is those two same traits we<br>can draw a line between right that's<br>where we go so these little dots just<br>represent a particular traits shared by<br>a particular trade either regulating<br>trait or a response to the university<br>so we can go through the entire network<br>in a community and draw lines the<br>thickness of those lines represent the<br>number of species that share that<br>combination of joints so the thicker the<br>line the more species that share that<br>trade and then we can do this all the<br>traits that we've got in our community<br>and draw something like this for<br>Wintergreen<br>but the visual thing is to look at is<br>that you can see there are some trait<br>combinations that many species share and<br>you can see other trait combinations<br>that maybe only several species do and<br>so you can link all of this up and again<br>it's the same idea network setup complex<br>they have more connections you have more<br>options for responding to stress in<br>absorbing stress or recovery from other<br>other disturbances<br>okay<br>so this is what we found<br>so when you do this<br>um we found that the resilience of the<br>system so the resilience to maintain<br>functionality because that's one set of<br>traits and the response diversity how it<br>handles stress another set of traits was<br>dependent on the net background Network<br>complexity so here's a control uh a<br>network that we built from a site that<br>had a high Network complexity site in<br>the control this is one that where that<br>Network complexity was more simplified<br>there was less connections there's less<br>functional traits in the community so<br>those little dots remember represents a<br>trait and there's less connections<br>between them and their response to the<br>to the nutrient stress was dependent on<br>that background complexity either<br>starting Network that you begin with so<br>in a system<br>that was complex to begin with and we<br>added the medium nutrient treatment and<br>the high nutrient treatment you can see<br>there's not a lot of change in that<br>Network completely it's absorbed that<br>stress generated by the medium and the<br>high nutrients and it's sort of<br>maintained it however if you take a<br>control Network complexity where where<br>the network complexity initially was<br>quite low and then stress it through the<br>nutrients you can see that that has had<br>an impact on the system and on that<br>complexity of that Network it's more<br>vulnerable to erosion of that resilience<br>so that background complexity was a<br>function of the turbidity within the<br>system okay in highly turbot systems<br>that tended to select for simpler<br>Network complexities the initial<br>starting point for uh clearer sites the<br>control networks uh or the background<br>networks look something like this so<br>again we can begin to see how that<br>turbidity stress is beginning to alter<br>the complexity of these networks that<br>makes it more vulnerable to an<br>additional stress nutrients<br>and this is kind of summed up uh in this<br>like here and it kind of try and explain<br>that in a way that hopefully people<br>understand so what we've got here on<br>this on the x-axis is the control<br>Network complexity so this is what the<br>in the control plots where we added no<br>nutrients this is what the complexity<br>looked like it's just an index saying if<br>it's a larger number there's more<br>connections and thicker connections as<br>you go down that gradient there's less<br>connections and less less species sheer<br>and then what we've got plotted here is<br>that change in complexity<br>relative to the background complexity so<br>you normalize the change in complexity<br>by what you started with to get some<br>sort of magnitude relative percentage<br>change and this is for the high<br>nutrients and the medium nutrients here<br>so the first take-home point from this<br>from this graph is if you have high<br>Network complexity then the medium and<br>high nutrients don't really call to that<br>complexity a great deal it doesn't fall<br>above that line or below that line<br>and the medium nutrient treatments you<br>can see as that Network complexity gets<br>simpler and simpler the starting one to<br>which we're adding nutrients then the<br>response becomes really variable there's<br>flickering going on you can see there's<br>a really positive effect of those<br>nutrients at some sites where the<br>network complexity increases but at<br>other sites there's a really negative<br>effect on that competency so the<br>variance in the system goes up and<br>actually if you're thinking about<br>Tipping Point Theory one of the<br>indicators of Tipping Point theory is<br>prior to falling off the cliff the<br>variance in the system begins to<br>increase<br>then under the high treatments you'll<br>see as that Network complexity increases<br>generally the outcomes are poorer and<br>poorer and then as it gets simpler<br>there's a much stronger negative effect<br>on that Network complexity and so these<br>systems again that turbidity stress<br>which is controlling that Network<br>complexity that initial one adding<br>nutrients into it affects the outcomes<br>of these systems<br>so<br>I think we've demonstrated this in those<br>couple of studies that the role that<br>that turbidity plays in terms of eroding<br>the ecological Network complexity and<br>reducing the options in the capacity for<br>stress remember these systems we're<br>working in if you were to go out and<br>have a look at them they wouldn't be<br>highly degraded we haven't worked across<br>systems in our gradients that there's a<br>mud put over here and a beautiful Sandy<br>seagrass system over here to look at<br>these systems all look very very similar<br>we've been working in a fairly narrow<br>range of ecological Health they're all<br>relatively good we've just been looking<br>at these subtle effects of these stress<br>distresses so tability erodes erodes<br>that ecological Network complexity<br>reducing options for further stress it<br>Alters the biodiversity ecosystem<br>functioning relationships and it also<br>Alters the resilient traits networks to<br>Future stresses as well<br>so as we're thinking about these kind of<br>diffuse stresses across New Zealand and<br>interacting them we've also got to start<br>thinking about a global context for this<br>as well and as we know the world's<br>warming<br>um and you know up from heat waves and<br>changing weather patterns there's also<br>going to be a profound effect on our<br>Coastal environment and particularly our<br>estrogen environments because they're<br>right at the pointy end of climate<br>change we will build walls to protect<br>Coastal infrastructure and building<br>those walls means we're going to lose<br>habitat and shift habitat in the Marine<br>systems<br>so a major sea level rise probably<br>doesn't make a whole lot of difference<br>in throughout in the open ocean where<br>several thousand meters of water depth<br>but an estuary where your main water<br>depth is only a couple of meters and<br>most of your habitat is into tidal it'll<br>represent massive shifts in the<br>proportion of the area that's underwater<br>versus areas of water that are above<br>water for some of the time and<br>underwater at other periods of time and<br>that's really that really got me<br>thinking about given the importance of<br>their hidden garden to our food webs the<br>productivity of these systems how will<br>The Changing submergence Times with sea<br>level rise begin to impact on<br>productivity especially if that's<br>coupled with poorer like climates<br>associated with civility<br>so if you read the European literature<br>um<br>there's this idea in these systems that<br>these intertidal habitats May provide<br>some windows of opportunity okay by<br>Windows of opportunity I mean when the<br>tides in the water's so dirty there's no<br>light headed in sea floor there's no<br>primary production of hearing when the<br>tides out<br>there's sand flats and mud flats are<br>exposed and therefore you might have<br>some resilience there might be a window<br>during those low tide Sunny periods with<br>a hidden garden the microfighter bean<br>Frost can actually get some productivity<br>underway and there's some food to be<br>passed on to the higher trophyllabus<br>and so that got me thinking about<br>um the sort of changing sea levels and<br>how that might alter the submergence<br>emergence areas and how that may impact<br>upon<br>um this giant ecosystem productivity the<br>base of the food chains<br>so you know habitat loss in New Zealand<br>estuaries is going to be dependent on a<br>whole lot of factors in terms of the<br>existing morphology in terms of whether<br>people build sea walls<br>um all of these kinds of things<br>treat<br>Etc so this is a little data we pulled<br>together from a number of the estuaries<br>we worked in for that tipping points<br>experiment where we sort of put it<br>through a meter or so sea level wise to<br>see how the proportion of that<br>intertidal area would change so some<br>histories were quite resilient you can<br>see that you can get 0.6 of a meter of<br>sea level rise and in very little lost<br>men's tidal area others we began losing<br>intertidal area immediately others we<br>sort of cross the threshold and it would<br>decrease very very quickly so the<br>individual responses and estuaries are<br>going to vary but if these estuaries are<br>turbot and they're dependent on that low<br>tide production then it's going to have<br>quite severe consequences for the<br>overall productivity of these ecosystems<br>so so Georgina for her PhD began playing<br>around<br>um with measuring um photosynthesis a<br>Radiance relationships so again we've<br>got our the infect Chambers out on the<br>sand Flats you can see this aerial image<br>of them here these sort of dark and<br>light squares represent different shade<br>cloth being added onto the lids of those<br>things and we can alter the light<br>climate um hitting the C4 and then from<br>that we can derive whole ecosystem and<br>photosynthesis for radiance curve so<br>Georgina went out um about eight times<br>over over two years to get some seasonal<br>information and I've collapsed um<br>everything that she did over two years<br>in terms of one graph and this is it<br>um so this is the relationship between<br>the photosynthetic radiation hitting the<br>sea floor and the amount of carbon<br>that's fixed by the system and I've got<br>two curves on here one for the emerge<br>production to the low tide production<br>that you measured When the tide was out<br>and one for the submerged production<br>um when the tide was in so the classic<br>photosynthesis Radiance curve the bands<br>around them just is the sort of seasonal<br>variation that was measured<br>interestingly when we look at the break<br>points in that ecosystem function that<br>we measured<br>um in the Tipping points experiment<br>across the whole of New Zealand remember<br>it's around 350 to 420 between clear and<br>turbot histories and that represents the<br>band right here<br>that 350 to 420 and that just happens to<br>fall right on the point where light<br>really becomes limiting to microfighter<br>Bender loss so these break points that<br>we're seeing in functionality and their<br>resilience to nutrient stress were<br>associated middle it's a correlation but<br>with the point at which light really<br>begins to limit<br>photosynthesis in The Hidden Garden<br>so what we can do with these kind of<br>photosynthesis Radiance gears that we<br>can begin to play some thought<br>experiments what if experiments and how<br>this might change if we alter the amount<br>of submergence time so how long they're<br>underwater how long they're out of the<br>water and also um the relationship<br>between the water column turbidity as it<br>may darken it the key thing to note for<br>the microfighter band filters of course<br>is that the emerge production is about a<br>quarter of the submerged production and<br>that's because it's probably nutrient<br>limited and desiccation is probably<br>slowing it down there's some but there's<br>not a lot<br>so we've been developing um these little<br>models where we look at the based on the<br>photosynthesis Radiance curves looking<br>at kind of if we alter the amount of<br>light in the water column so this is car<br>this is at 100 bringing it down<br>um to zero highly turbid systems and the<br>proportion of time submerged here we are<br>about uh 50 of the time submerged today<br>but that will decrease<br>um as the as the um<br>sea level begins to rise so this little<br>black dot here represents the current<br>day conditions where we are today so<br>there's a couple of key take home<br>messages if we keep this emergence time<br>the same as in today we will see a<br>decrease as a light see if your light<br>climate goes down you can see there's<br>still some emerged production here and<br>that's sustaining the ecosystem at low<br>tide production if we increase the<br>amount of time underwater and maintain<br>good light levels or productivity will<br>actually increase<br>okay we've got more time underwater<br>plenty of light hitting the sea floor<br>that's going to be good for business<br>however if we have the combination of<br>two stresses where with climate change<br>increasing storm intensity increasing<br>inputs the sediments of the land is<br>coupled with a decrease in the amount of<br>time that the spending open to the ear<br>then that decrease in that tail off of<br>production will be very very rapid<br>and these kind of relationships are<br>really important because at the end of<br>the day you know this microfight of<br>benthos they're little<br>um hidden garden there is allows what<br>allows these godwits which are just<br>arriving from their summer breeding<br>grounds in the northern hemisphere to go<br>from here to here in several months it's<br>a polyunsaturated fatty acids in the<br>microfight of benthos that fatten up<br>those birds and allow them to travel 13<br>000 kilometers in 10 days okay and if we<br>lose that intertidal habitat we lose<br>that production there'll be a cascading<br>consequences through um the entire<br>ecosystem impacting ecosystems half a<br>all right so just some hey quick take<br>home messages I'm almost out of time<br>um our history is a highly valued and<br>productive ecosystems we're still lucky<br>in at around New Zealand we're not in a<br>state that many histories are in the<br>northern hemisphere they're still<br>planning we can do the camera effects of<br>sediments and nutrients<br>um are eroding resilience to making them<br>prone to typically ruins however local<br>management action so what we can do here<br>and now can help build resilience we can<br>manage inputs from the land and we can<br>keep the water clear then that will<br>provide resilience to climate change in<br>terms of sea level wise because that<br>productivity at the base of the food<br>Conrad so<br>um I guess my first question I think<br>it's actually in the last sentence she<br>said which was managing said<br>how do you do that<br>um<br>um I think you know it's it's sort of<br>that's that's a challenge right so we've<br>been working with MFE as part of the<br>challenge in China you know it's a whole<br>of society effort right you know getting<br>getting the right trees in the right<br>place<br>um you know the right crops or the right<br>animal use on the land to riparian<br>planting and things like that and so you<br>know I've been thinking a lot about<br>um but I'm kind of interested in<br>exploring further is kind of you know<br>everyone goes oh it's too expensive it's<br>too much but there's lots happening<br>right you know waikato Regional<br>council's been investing Millions with<br>local landowners to fence and plant and<br>all those things have to have to happen<br>right you know sometimes we get bogged<br>down and the thought that oh you know<br>this is the most important place to do<br>it but we can't get it done there and so<br>we won't bother but in actual fact you<br>know there's probably you know as we<br>talk about kind of the negative effects<br>of human effects of stresses there's<br>also the positive effects of small<br>positive actions right that may build<br>other things so I think you know just<br>yeah planting you know<br>um and and better land use management<br>really is the key and we're still not<br>going to get rid of all of it<br>um because climate because just where we<br>live but there are you can have positive<br>impacts and if you reduce the sediment<br>loading is a good chance you're probably<br>going to help with nutrient loading as<br>well because a lot of those actions will<br>because<br>of stuff in there so based on your<br>functional trade-based assessment of<br>resilience and what are the chances of<br>the right species the right train to be<br>colonizing those areas once you've<br>managed in individually<br>um again I think it's pretty good<br>um again it's sort of it depends on what<br>scale the degradation is at right so if<br>you're just talking about kind of a<br>local degradation and a small part of<br>the history then you've got other parts<br>of history that may be a better shape<br>that can provide the recruits for that<br>recolonization just the entire history<br>is trashed and we do have New River<br>Estuary and Southland that's kind of<br>reaching that point that's basically<br>been draining most of the Southland<br>Dairy intensification now for a number<br>of years<br>that that recovery is probably going to<br>take a lot longer and so you know the<br>recovery process will happen as it<br>happens right<br>I think you know for most of the systems<br>we've been dealing with certainly the<br>ones where this data's been taken from<br>you know the management of stresses<br>should see positive responses remember<br>none of these none of these systems have<br>been you know turned it into like some<br>of the shallow lakes that you're dealing<br>with around here where the you know a<br>lot of nutrients and a lot of hypoxia<br>potentially these are still healthy<br>emotional ecosystems these data are more<br>around trying to get conversations with<br>managers around the changes happening we<br>you can't see it visually but there's<br>there is this erosion of the resilience<br>through these systems<br>I thought I'm sure I'll ask you a<br>question<br>uh the Legacy effects of cinnamon I<br>guess we did always settlement books<br>from the land it'd still be this<br>joke ongoing problem yeah um any<br>thoughts about you know the timelines<br>but um sea level wise might help us um<br>yeah again it's kind of it is it's sort<br>of there's this triage thing right like<br>and we've been talking about that a lot<br>about restoration right because that's<br>really where we have to go and and<br>terrestrial and fresh water systems have<br>been in that space for very long periods<br>in time but Marine space we don't have a<br>how-to book with that and the Legacy<br>especially of sediments and histories is<br>a big one right so I think it's about<br>kind of taking with some systems you may<br>do a little and<br>um you know it's a very long game you<br>know intergenerational game for<br>improvement and then you may be<br>dependent on a hurricane or something to<br>flush everything out well something you<br>know some major change but schools stood<br>in the shop can stop us from acting now<br>but then you've got these other systems<br>where a relatively pristine where some<br>careful management and some reduction in<br>loading will provide that resilience to<br>stop them tapping so you know that's a<br>question for managers in the society but<br>yeah um yeah certainly the Legacy<br>effects of mud and of course all the<br>feedback from mangroves and other things<br>will be around for long time as the<br>store nutrients are in somewhere like<br>excuse me<br>um<br>compounding effects of additional<br>stressors you've worked with too if you<br>know there's multiple multiples coming<br>up<br>um you picked the two obvious ones for<br>New Zealand but from a global context<br>when you put the other ones on top of it<br>acidification and temperature<br>how do you see those I mean do you see<br>those as as minor compared to nutrients<br>in sedimentation or do you see those as<br>you know equally important compounding<br>because yeah I think they equally<br>important and sort of what I'm really<br>interested in my mind is the kind of not<br>only fixed and climate change so you've<br>got these systems that are already<br>stressed by turbidity so maybe the<br>reproductive output of some animals and<br>it's either hanging in there so you<br>haven't lost them from the system they<br>may be functionally dead<br>um but then you know if you add a<br>stressor on top of that like a you know<br>Heat Wave event a lot of other estuaries<br>it's actually the terrestrials that are<br>more important than the Marine Heat Wave<br>events Marine hack without events only a<br>couple of degrees but what other<br>sub-lethal effects on on the animal<br>communities in these systems where you<br>know you may have reproductive failure<br>because they're exposed to you know<br>above average temperatures for for a few<br>weeks and then there's no animals babies<br>coming back in so I actually think<br>trying to understand and again we're<br>never going to understand<br>I see my role as kind of shining a light<br>on at least some Pathways that will get<br>people to act<br>um and sort of change because you know<br>there's a whole lot of stuff we don't<br>know but that shouldn't stop us kind of<br>trying to do the right thing now and I<br>think you know you're exactly right I<br>think when you put on<br>um you know climate change and<br>increasing temperatures and<br>acidification on top of nutrients and<br>Cinemas then we are going to be<br>potentially writing that results look at<br>that very simple Network that you showed<br>if it's really easy to break one of<br>I just want to point out that um we also<br>take questions over Zoom so people have<br>great talk I really really enjoyed that<br>um<br>just wondering I was really struck by<br>that difference and photosynthesis and<br>the submerged and emerged funds and I<br>was wondering do do those systems get<br>really hot when they're exposed to the<br>sun yeah they do in potentially lemon<br>yeah it does I think you know I've kind<br>of been a black<br>um a bit not naughties along with we're<br>dealing with it we're dealing with sand<br>Flats here so if you actually go to<br>Europe and you deal with the mud for<br>hats um they have characterized a lot of<br>the mud flats are the ones that you kind<br>of sink to your knees in right<br>um they're into tidal Productions way<br>higher than what we measure and that's<br>because you have these microbial<br>biofilms they trap a lot of moisture on<br>the sediment surfaces tons of nutrients<br>right at the sediment surface so with<br>our sound Flats because they don't have<br>a lot of mud content on I think the<br>water drains down and so there so the<br>plants are actually a little bit not<br>like limited or temperature limited they<br>just can't get the nutrients they need<br>to write a simple size and so I think<br>that's why we see quite a drop off so it<br>was part of Georgia as a PhD she also<br>worked on seagrass systems as well right<br>beside the things in the seagrass man<br>they're going about 80 or 90 of what<br>they can do underwater Out of Water<br>um so I do think it's probably in the<br>situation that we're dealing with most<br>of our instruments here we're still<br>Sandy not a whole lot of mud in them<br>um then it's probably a desiccation and<br>a new<br>opposed to too much light and too much<br>temperature<br>so ask a question<br>um so please start everything you've<br>discussed would you feel comfortable<br>calling the philanthrops the keystone<br>species for the entire I think I think<br>if we've forgotten component<br>um in the in these estrogen ecosystems<br>so it's a great paper done by some<br>people we know in the Netherlands a<br>number of years ago now where they<br>demonstrated the intertidal production<br>that occurs in the water and sea so a<br>big spot for the area of Northern<br>Germany and the Netherlands and it<br>actually fueled about 60 of the coastal<br>bioms subtitle as well<br>right because that's where all the<br>primary production are securing and so<br>when we when Georgina started doing her<br>PhD and then Steph Mangan as part of her<br>work we went into a literature review of<br>photosynthesis Iranian skills right so<br>you think oh light's important people<br>will study this right given the<br>importance of these microbes photo<br>auditories we found 14 studies<br>14 studies that actually determined<br>photosynthesis or Radiance relationships<br>it's a microfighter being fast you know<br>in the field or at least within Tech<br>communities that we're in kind of algal<br>cultures or something like that you do<br>the same search for terrestrial systems<br>you get like several hundred thousand<br>hats right and so yeah they're kind of<br>you know they're they're role in it<br>because everyone knows they're in order<br>but quantifying that importance and<br>demonstrating the relationships with<br>light and those kinds of things I think<br>it's funny we had some comments back<br>from that Georgina's paper and it was<br>kind of like well it's not like that we<br>are and you know but they've they this<br>their Baseline has shifted to a really<br>degraded State and so where they only<br>get low tide production and you know the<br>point was actually you know the<br>productivity of these systems is way<br>higher because of this um submerged<br>reduction is still school which is why<br>I follow our questions so I'm really<br>curious because<br>um you know from what I can<br>um understand the focal the focus of<br>these four allotrophs throughout the<br>fields is to be on your periodic ones<br>and but the thing is<br>um periodic um organisms can actually<br>use much less light yeah<br>so do you think I mean is there any<br>understanding of the relative<br>um again like you know the fact there's<br>only football team studies or Pi cures<br>tells you a lot about how far down the<br>line people are you know in identifying<br>what's there and the relative roles<br>but you're exactly right but I don't<br>think you know even you know you're<br>you're right there you know if we do<br>darken the waters then basically you<br>will get some photosynthesis occurring<br>but it won't nearly be at the levels<br>there you've got</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
