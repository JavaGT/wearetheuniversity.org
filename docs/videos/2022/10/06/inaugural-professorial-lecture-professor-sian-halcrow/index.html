celebrate<br>the achievements and promotion of<br>Professor Sean halcrow my name is<br>Richard Blakey I'm the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and Enterprise<br>here at the University of otago and I'm<br>here representing the vice Chancellor<br>Professor David Murdoch who sends his<br>apologies but as I understand is quite<br>an officiado anado of watching these<br>events online or or subsequently so<br>welcome Sean congratulations on your<br>achievement<br>members of the academic party welcome to<br>members of our university community<br>tenakoto Welcome to our visitors from<br>the Dunedin City and around the world on<br>online welcome as well but I'd like to<br>extend a special welcome to<br>special guests of Shand your daughter<br>Alia is here and I believe your parents<br>you've got a brother niece nephew great<br>niece and friends from Family far and<br>wide both here and online so to you all<br>um no my how am I welcome and this is a<br>wonderful celebration event and it's<br>something in the calendar of academic<br>leaders at the University that we look<br>forward to every week that it is a time<br>where we can reflect in the achievement<br>of our<br>academic staff<br>in reaching that status of professor at<br>the University<br>our event tonight is uh is quite<br>straightforward uh the dean of the<br>school of biomedical Sciences Professor<br>Lisa Madison Smith will give a detailed<br>introduction to the speaker and we'll<br>get a vote of thanks at the end before<br>we have Refreshments afterwards but I<br>just want to spend one or two minutes<br>giving you an outline of of what it<br>means to be promoted to professor at the<br>University of otago we require our<br>professors to be outstanding in the<br>field and their discipline in their<br>ability to both generate new knowledge<br>through research and to disseminate<br>knowledge through teaching good<br>researchers<br>are very celebrated here but you have to<br>be an excellent teacher as well and you<br>have to contribute service to your<br>discipline to your community and to<br>others as well at the highest level<br>we are also require our professors to<br>demonstrate strong leadership in their<br>discipline and in their areas as well<br>and as you'll see tonight through the<br>introduction in the end the lecture that<br>in Sean halcrow we have someone that has<br>demonstrated those attributes to the<br>highest standard um<br>as I I test through looking at her CV<br>but also we use international referees<br>to make sure that we Benchmark our<br>standards to to the best Global<br>University<br>um<br>Sean's going to tell us a really great<br>story and um look I I could I could talk<br>about the fact that her research has<br>globally recognized that it's requires a<br>lot of effort to do the work in the<br>field where she does it I could talk a<br>lot about her the strength and high how<br>highly valued her teaching is across<br>years from 100 level up to postgraduate<br>level I could talk about her outstanding<br>service but I think what I'll do is just<br>leave it there and offer the sincere<br>congratulations on behalf of the<br>university to most well deserved<br>promotion Sean and now invite Professor<br>Lisa Matsu Smith the dean of the school<br>of biomedical Sciences to introduce our<br>speaker for you and<br>um<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>thank you Richard and thank you<br>everybody for coming here<br>um tonight to celebrate this event and<br>um and celebrate celebrate Sean<br>so<br>um as Richard explained I am the acting<br>dean of biomedical Sciences<br>but I was formerly the head of<br>Department of anatomy and professor of<br>biological anthropology so it is<br>particularly<br>um<br>I'm particularly proud to be able to<br>celebrate with you Sean and with all of<br>you tonight that we are celebrating uh<br>Sean's inaugural professorial lecture<br>so as Richard said we could go on for<br>for all night talking about all of the<br>amazing things that Sean has achieved<br>but I'm going to try to keep it short<br>and to the point because you're really<br>here to listen to us we all are here to<br>listen to to Sean talk about her<br>research so just a little bit about Sean<br>she is a renowned bioarchaeologist and<br>honored internationally for her<br>groundbreaking work she has reshaped our<br>understanding of the impacts of the<br>Agricultural transition on society<br>through studying the health and<br>experiences of the most vulnerable<br>infants and children<br>these revolutionary changes of past<br>human societies have major repercussions<br>for much of the world today<br>particularly those living in poverty and<br>in sanitary crowded conditions<br>Sean interrogates Central archaeological<br>models of the intensification of<br>Agriculture and of human responses<br>during the seminal time and pre-history<br>in diverse environments<br>and these are generally environments<br>that have been ignored historically<br>due to eurocentric perspectives<br>so she has managed skeletal analyzes and<br>projects in Thailand Laos Cambodia China<br>and Chile<br>and has an outstanding International<br>reputation through her years of<br>cutting-edge methods and contributions<br>to theoretical approaches in the study<br>of childhood in the past and a<br>commitment to ethical practices in her<br>field and she is particularly well known<br>for for these two areas and is an<br>invited and requested speaker around the<br>world<br>since 2007 Sean has published more than<br>120 peer-reviewed Publications and the<br>highest impact journals and books in in<br>you<br>she is co she is co-editor-in-chief of<br>one of the most Innovative journals in<br>the subject bioarcheology International<br>and has produced several additions that<br>are transforming the future of the<br>discipline uh<br>and she sits on numerous International<br>academic boards and associations<br>her prominence and the study of infancy<br>and childhood and the archaeological<br>past is internationally unmatched she is<br>truly a Pioneer in the field<br>and particularly focusing on the first<br>thousand days of life from conception<br>through through childhood and the<br>maternal environment and the later life<br>outcomes of what happens during these<br>periods<br>this topic is Central to the the mother<br>infant Nexus which he will be talking to<br>us about and understanding the evolution<br>she uh is has co-edited a book called<br>the mother infant Nexus in the past<br>Small Beginnings and significant<br>outcomes and it has received<br>International<br>recognition and has sold more than ten<br>thousand copies today and this was<br>published in 2020 so truly truly<br>impressive<br>she has external research funding of<br>more than five and a half million<br>dollars from International organizations<br>including wintergren National Geographic<br>the Australian research Council the<br>fondac which is the Chilean National<br>Fund for if I can remember the The<br>Innovation Science and Technology I<br>think is is what the Chilean NSF<br>virtually is and of course here numerous<br>Marston grants and a Fulbright travel<br>award<br>her honors include election and she is a<br>fellow of the Society of antiquaries in<br>London in 2018. she won the University<br>of otago Rowe's trust award and Carl<br>Smith research medal in 2018 and the New<br>Zealand Association of scientists Hill<br>Tinsley medal also in 2018.<br>um<br>so that's kind of you know just just a<br>glossing over of Sean's accomplishments<br>on paper but it just you know it's quite<br>amazing when I think back I actually<br>knew Sean as a first year student at the<br>University of Auckland<br>where I think I was her tutor for the<br>introduction of biological anthropology<br>and then later I taught her at 300 level<br>in the history of anthropology and<br>Sean stood out even then I still<br>remember marking her first year exam and<br>one she had very very neat handwriting<br>um<br>but um you know she was one of those<br>students that that just<br>you know clicked really got it and and<br>you kept an eye out for those students<br>and so when she came into the history of<br>anthropology paper that I was teaching<br>in<br>um<br>it was not surprising that she topped<br>the class and those were inevitably the<br>students that that really we we targeted<br>for for post-grad studies so I was most<br>distraught when she disappeared and she<br>was no longer there as a student in the<br>anthropology department at Auckland and<br>I had wondered what happened to her and<br>uh was thrilled to find out that she<br>stayed in the field but she'd moved down<br>here to otago and it was was doing her<br>honors with Nancy Taylor's and then<br>carried on and did her PhD so she was<br>awarded her her ba-ons in 2002 and then<br>her PhD in 2007. so tonight we get to<br>hear Sean talk about her research<br>in BIO archeology or the study of human<br>remains from archaeological contexts and<br>we will see how her research really<br>focuses on major questions about social<br>transformations in the human past so she<br>will be talking to us about the<br>agricultural transition and the impact<br>that it has had and in particular the<br>negative impacts on past human<br>populations<br>and and<br>um using a number of of excellent case<br>studies<br>um really interesting uh examples from<br>diverse regions around the world<br>um<br>she will demonstrate uh the value of<br>this<br>multi-disciplinary approach and the<br>importance of<br>highly contextualized interpretation<br>which takes skill that I think you will<br>see Sean demonstrating tonight<br>so um please join me in welcoming Sean<br>to give her inaugural professorial<br>lecture and the title of it is sensitive<br>little Souls insights into our past<br>thank you<br>tinakote<br>thank you very much for the introduction<br>it was really lovely<br>um Richard and Lisa I really appreciate<br>that and thank you very much to Neo and<br>Christine as well who you'll hear from<br>later<br>thank you very much for coming to my<br>family<br>um and friends who are like whanau to<br>the tahiko Calvin's into frisbees as<br>well who are here somewhere<br>um<br>just a little bit of a Content warning I<br>don't have many pictures but there will<br>be some photos of human remains so some<br>people may feel uncomfortable with it<br>but I've tried to limit them somewhat<br>but it was a bit hard with the content<br>that I was talking about before I start<br>I just wanted to dedicate this to my<br>firstborn Casey halcrow who hopefully is<br>watching this on live stream<br>Casey was born near the end of my PhD<br>and so I was endured research in my<br>academic professional development since<br>the new Shiro period in his head some<br>major<br>um fantastic<br>experiences overseas in terms of<br>learning about new cultures learning<br>different languages she spoke a lot of<br>time when she was one and a half<br>probably more tired in English<br>um but it also came with some stresses<br>along the way and you know that I cry<br>with it prop of a head<br>um<br>so this is dedicated to her and I also<br>wanted to<br>acknowledge her little sister Aaliyah<br>who woke up at 3am this morning<br>she looks up to her older siblings so<br>much apart from myself You're My<br>Greatest critics and I love you both to<br>the Moon and back<br>so I was thinking the other day when I<br>was watching a Liam my my eight-year-old<br>she was working with clay and I thought<br>actually this would be a very good<br>analogy to use in teaching in the<br>concepts that we use in BIO archeology<br>and biological anthropology we look at<br>the body as being shaped it's constantly<br>being remodeled and shaped by the<br>environmental circumstances that we live<br>in<br>um and I came across this picture of<br>this um<br>plasticine person and I thought this was<br>a very good one because it shows<br>different steps and you could liken<br>those two steps and development<br>throughout life<br>but even though you develop and you move<br>further along that trajectory you're<br>always connected to the start Point<br>you're always connected to to the<br>maternal environment okay and that<br>maternal environment has so many effects<br>on your later Life Health<br>um which is really important to think<br>about in our work and when I was<br>thinking about this in the context of<br>teaching I also thought actually this is<br>a very good analogy for thinking about<br>professional and academic development<br>because it doesn't happen in a vacuum<br>and I've been molded and helped along<br>the way<br>by many many people so a lot of this IPL<br>is actually talking about the influences<br>on me in the people who help me along<br>the way<br>this is a photo of me how old was I<br>four months it's gone blank here but<br>it's up there<br>um and that hand is actually my maternal<br>grandmother's hand<br>um I remember she was so kind to me she<br>died I think I was about seven<br>and I always remember who Bengals were<br>always clinging away<br>um I my parents are here<br>um and I've I'm one of five siblings and<br>we're first generation University goers<br>um<br>I was born not two<br>um<br>far before the 1980s I won't give away<br>my butt and<br>um born in Auckland and then our family<br>moved down to Central Southland which<br>was a bit of a shock<br>and then in my primary school years we<br>moved up to Omar omaru and I spent most<br>of my primary because I spent much of my<br>primary school there and also most of my<br>high school years I found school to be<br>a nomaru anyway but under stimulating<br>and it didn't really extend me very much<br>but I had the opportunity to actually go<br>up to Auckland for my seventh form year<br>which is year 13 these days<br>and I had some fantastic teachers there<br>who really extended me and I was looking<br>through some of my boxes the other day<br>sentimental items I like to get rid of<br>stuff and I came across a little note<br>from my biology teacher Miss aramaiah<br>and it said she must have given it to me<br>at the end of seventh form year she said<br>what are you doing at University are you<br>doing biology<br>and in fact I did I went to the Auckland<br>University and I started biology we were<br>always kind of well I was always kind of<br>pushed down the track of Science in<br>mathematics because I was there was a<br>notion that it was too bright to do<br>stuff like you know Humanities history<br>and that kind of stuff<br>which is a bit silly really looking back<br>on it<br>um but I really did love social science<br>I loved the gender studies papers that I<br>was taking at Auckland University and<br>obviously the anthropology papers I was<br>taking as well<br>and then I found out about biological<br>anthropology and I thought well this is<br>great you can actually combine these<br>things together and Lisa was talking<br>about the paper that I took the history<br>of anthropology and it's kind of stayed<br>with me it's a paper that I remember<br>very well<br>um it was a fulfilled approach<br>um but I remembered the biological<br>anthropology in particular<br>and thinking about<br>our academic discipline in the context<br>of social and political climates<br>and that's what I always like to do when<br>I'm thinking about why we're doing what<br>we do in biological anthropology and I<br>think it's really stimulated my interest<br>in theoretical approaches in Social bio<br>archeology<br>between my second and third year I must<br>have done the third year paper in my<br>second year I came down to<br>otago I may have seen the light that's<br>what you could say and I did a paper<br>that was formerly anthropology 307 and<br>it was taught by Hallie Buckley and and<br>Nancy Taylor's<br>and I really loved it Mark for one we<br>were working for our labs in the anatomy<br>Museum and I just thought wow I didn't<br>know these kinds of resources actually<br>existed number one into I really like<br>the Practical aspect of learning about<br>human biology skeletal<br>um<br>about the about bones but also it was<br>very<br>um contextualized<br>um with an anthropological thought<br>um so I decided that I want to continue<br>down that track and Nancy Taylor's took<br>me under her wing for my fourth year<br>um and she must have thought I was okay<br>because she invited me to go to Thailand<br>at the end of my fourth year and that<br>was actually the first field season from<br>at Bunn onward which is a very important<br>prehistoric High site in the isan area<br>um it's been excavated by Charles Heim<br>and Dr rachni tosserat<br>um I actually put this picture here of<br>the excursor of one of the excavation<br>pits there were three main excavation<br>squares and this one was particularly<br>deep but they also<br>um this<br>excavation Square also had a lot of<br>infants and children that were being<br>excavated in there and Nancy said to me<br>I remember who sang you know Sean you're<br>so much better at me than Excavating<br>these I want you to focus on the Square<br>and I'll focus on the main square and if<br>I need any help I'll come you know and<br>ask you for help and you can come along<br>to the main square and I thought this is<br>really good she must think I'm really<br>good at Excavating and you're really<br>good at juvenile osteology and it wasn't<br>until years later that I realized she<br>was quite anxious to go down the perch<br>because it was so so deep it is scared<br>about it<br>the data side Nancy was an amazing insta<br>was an amazing Mentor I wouldn't have a<br>job if it wasn't for her she always gave<br>me so many opportunities and she was<br>very thorough she was very scholarly but<br>she also had a lot of patience and she<br>was also very lovely to my children and<br>understood<br>you know the challenges of having our<br>and I've been very privileged to be able<br>to work in many different parts of the<br>world so I've collated a little video<br>which I hope will work just to show you<br>some of those places<br>it's not going to be too loud<br>foreign<br>okay so now moving on to my research I<br>suppose you could categorize my research<br>into three main themes the first is what<br>I'm going to be talking about tonight in<br>some detail and I'm very interested in<br>looking at the question of major social<br>changes of the human past and the<br>changes which happen in in response to<br>things like climate change<br>agricultural development and<br>intensification and also the<br>intensification of social inequality<br>or the increase in social inequality and<br>quite often these go hand in hand<br>together I'm also very interested in the<br>ethics of bioarchaeological practice and<br>we often work in different places of the<br>world so it's really important to think<br>about that<br>um and I'm also very interested in the<br>bioeffics of historical Legacy<br>collections that are held in museums and<br>institutions and I've got research<br>throughout New Zealand and also starting<br>in the US looking at some of those<br>questions<br>and as I said before I'm very interested<br>in<br>the development of social theory or the<br>adoption of social theory and<br>so the general model of Health change<br>with the Agricultural Development and<br>intensification<br>persists that there was a general<br>deterioration in human health and that<br>came about from for a number of reasons<br>people begin to become sedentary living<br>foreign<br>with sedentism there was also the<br>ability for populations to grow people<br>were living in dense acetamines and that<br>brought around in sanitary living<br>conditions<br>also with agricultural food crops there<br>was there's generally a reduction in<br>dietary diversity and therefore<br>nutritional value and diet and also with<br>agriculture you've obviously got the<br>demystification of animals and more<br>propensity for disease transmission<br>between animals and humans and we saw<br>this very well with covert for example<br>which is a zoonotic disease<br>so my work tests this General<br>bioarchaeological model in the range of<br>human responses and very diverse<br>environments and I'll be going through<br>some case studies showing you how I do<br>that now you might be thinking why on<br>Earth do I care about this what is the<br>relevance of looking at this today and<br>it is extremely relevant because more<br>than half of the population of the world<br>actually lives in in sanitary very<br>crowded living conditions and that has<br>its ultimate roots with the development<br>of Agriculture and the demographic<br>transition that occurred at that time<br>and we're obviously<br>um reliant on agricultural food crops as<br>well<br>so I'm looking at the the ultimate<br>origins of that<br>now in BIO archeology over the last 10<br>or 15 years it's become widely<br>acknowledged that looking at infant and<br>child health is a very sensitive measure<br>of overall overall population health<br>in my lab's been looking at the mother<br>infant Nexus and health in the past this<br>hasn't been looked at as much but I<br>would argue that it's probably the most<br>sensitive way in which we can look at<br>overall population Health that's because<br>during pregnancy we've got increased<br>energetic requirements for both the<br>mother and the baby<br>um in pregnant mothers are more<br>susceptible to new disease into<br>malnutrition and the exacerbation of<br>disease as well during pregnancy<br>and we know that the health experience<br>during the neutral period can have<br>lifelong effects<br>on adult health<br>so my lab has been looking at different<br>ways in which we can interrogate the<br>maternal infant Nexus and look at<br>maternal transmission of stress to the<br>infant and we can look at this in a<br>number of ways I've done a lot of work<br>looking at infant mortality and I've had<br>students that have been looking at<br>developing methods looking at<br>physiological stress through Dental<br>enamel defects on the teeth<br>um for example we can look at specific<br>teeth that formed during the neutral<br>period and they can tell us something<br>about a neutral stress<br>we can also look at evidence of<br>pathology so bone pathology on infants<br>and that can tell you something about<br>maternal stress as well<br>and we can look at the matuna one for<br>Nexus by interrogating infant diet and<br>also weaning using chemical methods<br>so um as Lisa alluded to before this<br>General model of Health change with<br>agricultural development is based mainly<br>on Research in Europe in North America<br>and we're not starting to think about<br>what I wanted to do for my PhD a lot of<br>work was coming out of Southeast Asia<br>and it was showing that the that General<br>Health change wasn't<br>um being recognized in the<br>bioarchaeological data in Southeast Asia<br>and there are various hypotheses put<br>forward for why that was the case<br>so I was interested in looking at this<br>question of agricultural change and<br>health change and I looked at this in<br>looking at this through infant in child<br>human remains<br>um<br>because there's a long-standing<br>research collaboration between Charles<br>Heim at the University of otago and the<br>Thai finance department there'd been a<br>lot of excavations that have been done<br>and they'd be done primarily in in<br>Northeast Thailand any also excavated<br>the site of cop and on D<br>um so I was able to look at the infant<br>and child component of these different<br>sites and I chose these different sites<br>because they range from about 4 000<br>years ago which was around the time of<br>the development of agriculture in the<br>region through to about 1500 years ago<br>which was the time when the so-called<br>Iron Age and there was a time when we<br>had increased technological development<br>and the intensification of wet rice<br>so unfortunately I didn't actually find<br>any clear deterioration in health even<br>though I really wanted to find something<br>I looked at a lot of different methods I<br>looked at infant mortality I looked at<br>growth disruption in the teeth I looked<br>at physical linear growth and I also<br>looked at oral health to see if there<br>was any changes in that with subsistence<br>change and I also tried to look at<br>evidence for skeletal pathology to look<br>at bone disease<br>um<br>a problem that we have in the<br>archaeological record is a lot of the<br>Iron Age sites actually had really bad<br>bone preservation so I wasn't able to<br>look at some of the skeletal pathology<br>but there was hints that there was an<br>increase in infection rate in the Iron<br>Age<br>but I did find that there was a<br>statistically significant increase in<br>infant mortality in the Iron Age so<br>something was going on there in terms of<br>a health transition<br>so I maintained interest in that and I<br>continued in my postdoc in over the<br>years to excavate at sites at in in the<br>upper Moon River Valley in Northeast<br>Thailand because you'll notice whoops<br>way<br>that while these sites are in the<br>general vicinity to each other I<br>couldn't necessarily control for<br>environmental differences because<br>they're in different geographical<br>locations<br>but we started to excavate some new<br>sites that were very very close to each<br>other in the site of burden on what as<br>well had a very long archaeological<br>sequence so we could compare the<br>different phases within the one site so<br>this is just showing you some of the<br>demographic data that we had from these<br>sites that are very close together in<br>the upper Moon River Valley and<br>Northeast Thailand and it's showing the<br>proportion of infants in children<br>um<br>in the different age groups under 19<br>years of age and you'll see in the Iron<br>Age you've actually got a statistically<br>significant increase in the<br>um under one-year-olds and you can also<br>see that you've got some more pre-term<br>deaths as well<br>so what does this mean maybe we're<br>having a later Health transition in the<br>Iron Age and that kind of does make a<br>bit of sense in terms of what we know<br>about social and environmental change at<br>that time we find archaeological<br>evidence for these massive big modes for<br>water storage and that's thought that<br>those moats are used for the irrigation<br>for the wet rice agriculture<br>but when you have standing water like<br>that it's not very good for waterborne<br>diseases in the transmission of those to<br>to humans also we see that there's a<br>increase in social inequality through<br>the archaeological evidence at these at<br>these inh sites and we also see<br>archaeological evidence for the<br>domestication of animals and also the<br>crawling of animals into spaces that are<br>very close to the human habitation sites<br>so this could also increase the<br>transmission of zoonotic disease<br>now moving to a very different place in<br>a very different case study<br>now to the Atacama Desert which is in<br>Northern Chile<br>um I was very lucky to be awarded<br>Marsden Grant and collaboration with Dr<br>Bernardo ariaza and Dr Vivian standen<br>and this was to look at the question of<br>the Agricultural transition across a<br>very um long time span<br>from the Archaic Period through to the<br>early formative period where we've got a<br>fully Agricultural Society<br>now this area is very well known<br>archaeologically it's a very famous<br>world heritage area and we've got the<br>earliest evidence for artificial<br>mummification in the world there<br>um<br>and they predate Egyptian mummification<br>by about two millennia<br>we hypothesize that the effects of the<br>health chain of Health change with the<br>agricultural transition would have been<br>heightened in this environment because<br>it's the driest desert in the world very<br>very marginal environment<br>and we've got a very good time sequence<br>from the Archaic Period we've got<br>Maritime hunter-gatherer people often<br>referred to as chinchuro<br>who relied on obviously<br>um<br>fish but also wild terrestrial plants<br>the early formative period we see<br>supplementary horticulturalism in about<br>three thousand five hundred years ago<br>and in the late formative period we've<br>got evidence for a fully Agricultural<br>Society where they're reliant on Maize<br>and I just wanted to show you a very<br>short clip um it's a new BBC video and<br>just to show you the marginal<br>environment and you'll actually hear<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>women<br>your eyes<br>so as part of this larger project I'm<br>very fortunate to have a very smart PhD<br>student at the time who's now a research<br>golo in the department Dr Annie snotty<br>she was working on looking at the<br>potential impact of this changing<br>subsistence economy on the prevalence of<br>metabolic and infectious disease in the<br>relationship between metabolic<br>infectious disease as well and the<br>ancient Atacama Desert and I just wanted<br>to<br>um present a very small case series that<br>was quite interested interesting this<br>was from a site called kiani7 so the<br>coastal site but it's spanned between<br>the late archaic and the early formative<br>period so from about 3 600 years ago to<br>about 3 200 years ago and we see that<br>there's a cultural shift from this<br>Archaic Period of chengchu Mortuary<br>practices we've got artificial<br>mummification<br>and early evidence for the adoption of<br>domesticates including Bean squash<br>potato and quinoa<br>so there are only 12 individuals at the<br>site eight adults but four of them were<br>infants and they're aged around the<br>perinatal period so from about 34 weeks<br>prenatal to about two months postnatal<br>and as you can see here they're all<br>extraordinarily well preserved and this<br>is the case because it's such an arid<br>environment we've got amazing skeletal<br>preservation we also often have<br>preservation of soft tissue which<br>ironically means that we can't look at<br>some evidence for palip pathology on the<br>bone but she found there all the peering<br>out so all the infants actually had<br>pathology on the bones it was indicative<br>of metabolic disease likely Scooby and<br>that was really another really<br>interesting find is that there was a<br>mother infant pair<br>that both had evidence for Scooby the<br>mother had likely head Scooby<br>so it means that there was probably<br>maternally transferred vitamin C<br>deficiency which isn't actually seen in<br>the clinical literature<br>um<br>so what does this mean it probably means<br>that<br>um it's um indicative of a shift in<br>resource utilization from very high<br>vitamin C wild resources that were<br>present there and eating things like<br>seal and porous liver to relying very<br>much on low Vitamin C processed<br>um and it also highlights the fact that<br>looking at the neutral environment and<br>including infant paleopathology within<br>our studies and bioarcheology it's<br>actually really important in the fetal<br>period could actually be a very good<br>indicator for looking at micronutrient<br>deficiency<br>we can also look at the maternal infant<br>Nexus by looking at diet and weaning of<br>infants and children now obviously<br>looking at infant diet is really<br>important because it tells us something<br>about the nutrition for infants and<br>children but weaning time is also really<br>important to look at especially with the<br>agricultural transition<br>waning time for women is fundamentally<br>linked to futility<br>and therefore the potential for<br>population growth and we know that there<br>was a massive explosion in population<br>in many different places in the world<br>with the agricultural transition<br>now we can look at this visibly through<br>ice isotope chemistry and in particular<br>looking at carbon and nitrogen<br>so when a baby is being breastfed<br>they're essentially eating<br>food that's made by the mother's tissues<br>okay so they're always going to be a<br>trophic level<br>higher than the um the mother's tissues<br>so we can look at that<br>in the archaeological context<br>so um Dr Charlotte King who's also a<br>research fellow in a lecturer in the<br>department of anatomy to do postdoc as<br>part of this larger project in what she<br>did is she sampled down through the<br>dentine of from the teeth and through<br>there you can produce individual life<br>so our expectation is and we can<br>critique this expectation there's a bit<br>of there's a bit of a problem with it<br>but with the adoption of Agriculture<br>when you've got more starchy<br>carbohydrate food it's assumed that<br>you're going to be weaning your babies<br>earlier because you've got more<br>supplementary<br>food for them again there's some<br>problems with this<br>and<br>so Charlotte was looking at this and she<br>what she did was she compared the<br>pre-agricultural period with the early<br>formative in the late formative period<br>but she didn't actually find that there<br>was any temporal changes to the behavior<br>and weaning and infant feeding over time<br>which was quite interesting it appeared<br>to be idiosyncratic throughout the<br>archaeological sequence lots of<br>individual variation and also<br>interestingly the weaning curves weren't<br>as expected<br>so this is just one example of a weaning<br>curve and this is showing the the<br>nitrogen isotope values and you can see<br>here this is zero so this is time of<br>birth<br>in after birth this decreases by about<br>eight parts per ml<br>so that's not indicative of a change in<br>diet that's too much so it probably<br>means that this baby in utero was<br>experiencing a lot of stress and that<br>was causing fractionation or a change in<br>the isotope ratios and mutual so this is<br>telling stories of individual stress<br>in when we're looking at health and diet<br>in the past we always have to be<br>thinking about social factors that can<br>impact on those things<br>my most recent Marsden which is just<br>finishing up now was looking at the<br>effects of social inequality<br>in in ancient China and I just wanted to<br>present a small case study looking at<br>infant and child diet in eastern Jew<br>Dynasty in the central plains of China<br>this work is done in collaboration with<br>dong Yu from Shandong University Dr<br>Melanie Miller from otago and also<br>Berkeley<br>and Dr Kate who's at the city at Cooney<br>um<br>at this time in the Eastern Joe period<br>we see major cultural and technological<br>changes in terms of Technology we see<br>advances in bronze and iron production<br>and also pottery and textiles<br>and we also see the development of a<br>very patriarchal society in increasing<br>social inequality as you could imagine<br>so we looked at five different<br>archaeological sites for this study I'm<br>very close to the<br>um<br>at the the Isotopes showing nice weaning<br>curves but a lot of differences between<br>individuals so again you've got a lot of<br>individual variation in what's happening<br>in terms of diet but she sees that over<br>time the male averages of nitrogen are<br>slightly higher meaning that they've<br>probably got more meat consumption than<br>the female average and this is occurring<br>um so what does this mean it probably<br>means that there's gendered identities<br>are embodied for Eastern Joe people from<br>a very early age throughout<br>through infant feeding practices and we<br>find a lot of evidence from this leader<br>remains that they were very<br>um Stark differences between Health<br>experiences of adult males and females<br>as well<br>so to conclude the patterns of Health<br>change what the agricultural transition<br>are regionally specific and they share a<br>range of people show a range of<br>adaptation to very diverse natural and<br>social environments and the recent<br>advances in methods that we're using in<br>approaches are showing this very strong<br>Nexus between the mother and the infant<br>and their shared stories of stress<br>so I've got a lot of acknowledgments<br>um part one for my collaborators<br>um firstly I want to acknowledge the<br>heads of Department over the years from<br>when I was a student through to when<br>I've been an academic and in particular<br>I want to acknowledge Dave Bretton who's<br>unfortunately in Wellington tonight he's<br>always been a great mentor Neil gimmel<br>has always put me forward for things so<br>thank you very much for that I'm not<br>sure why but it was lovely<br>um Lisa thank you very much for<br>supporting my promotion application I<br>have really appreciate it and Christine<br>and<br>um<br>for being a great new heated department<br>and being so supportive and also to<br>Louise and John who are the deputy<br>headset department at the moment I also<br>want to give a massive massive shout out<br>to amazing professional team and I've<br>got so many other names that can be put<br>on that so if you're not on that I'm<br>really sorry I was probably thinking of<br>you but I was too anxious and put them<br>all in<br>our large lab group as well<br>and there's many other people and people<br>within the university and also my<br>International collaborators<br>um in funders and last but not least I<br>want to acknowledge my students that<br>I've had my postgrad students I wanted<br>to do a collage of all the faces but I<br>realized I wasn't going to have enough<br>room<br>um I probably learn more from students<br>and they learn from me so it's really<br>great academically and you kind of give<br>me a reason to get out of bed every day<br>so thank you very much and thank you<br>very much for coming<br>if we run<br>jotted down a few notes is this one<br>so um it's my job to<br>um be the person who gets to close after<br>that and it's always difficult to be the<br>one who follows a fantastic talk so I<br>will try to keep this brief I I hope<br>that you were able to see demonstrated<br>quite clearly Sean's World leading<br>science and reflected in her fantastic<br>collegial<br>and peer support<br>that she that has really kind of made<br>her through her work a world leading<br>figure in childhood bio archeology<br>so I think Sean exemplifies Excellence<br>through traditional academic metrics so<br>she's driven she's high integrity<br>critical inquiry training of students<br>pure esteem massive Publications books<br>Etc but I think one of the things that<br>came through here quite clearly is that<br>Sean is also an exemplary modern<br>academic so she's been able to balance<br>motherhood with a fantastic<br>enviable academic career and one of the<br>things that hasn't really been said but<br>you was kind of subtly woven through<br>some of the things that she talked about<br>is her unwavering support for women in<br>science and particularly young women in<br>science she has been an advocate and a<br>supporter and a fantastic Mentor for<br>heaps and heaps a female Junior and now<br>growing into senior academics she's also<br>a fantastic contributor to communities<br>she's out there talking about her<br>research trying to get people<br>enthusiastic share her science and her<br>findings and she does this through<br>Outreach in our own Community but of<br>course also she's deeply invested in<br>bringing her research and her passion<br>for her work to the communities that she<br>works with in all of the regions of the<br>world that we've heard about<br>and um I guess from my perspective as a<br>new hod I just really wanted to say that<br>in the department she's an invaluable<br>colleague she's kind and generous and<br>intelligent and always willing to help<br>out with a smiling face and I think I<br>want to really just end with that and<br>thank you Sean for a fantastic talk and<br>for all of the things that you<br>congratulate you for all of the things<br>you achieved and just ask everybody here<br>I have a I have a gift that we would<br>like to present to Sean on the um on<br>behalf of the University of otago to<br>thank you for your lecture and of course<br>to congratulate you on your promotion</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
