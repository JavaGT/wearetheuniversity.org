Broadbent my name is Richard<br>Blakey I'm the deputy Vice Chancellor<br>for research and Enterprise I<br>representing the vice Chancellor here<br>tonight Vice Chancellor is very um<br>passes on his apologies for not being<br>able to attend but as an Aficionado of<br>looking at many of our ipl's online<br>subsequently he's often a trip to the<br>Pacific right now<br>um<br>these are celebrations of achievements<br>and uh and uh the academic and the<br>academic life of the university in which<br>we invite<br>um colleagues<br>members of the professor professors<br>family members of the uh of the um<br>Dunedin community and actually through<br>our live web stream members of the<br>global community so to to you all here<br>and to the Four Winds uh no my hanamai<br>toti my welcome<br>um the order of proceedings for tonight<br>is I will try and say as little as<br>possible but then we will hand over to<br>Paul Cooper the dean of the faculty of<br>Dentistry to introduce Jonathan's speech<br>I will then have some votes of thanks<br>and have opportunity for fellowship at<br>the staff group at the end of the<br>evening I just want to set the scenes by<br>indicating why we<br>why we take these occasions seriously<br>and why we love to celebrate the<br>promotion to Professor particularly for<br>someone like myself actually Jonathan<br>that actually came through his own as<br>through our undergraduate programs<br>firstly it's an affirmation of what we<br>do that that our programs are good and<br>sound and that we graduate people who<br>have the capability to go on and Achieve<br>at the highest level in their in their<br>academic or their professional or their<br>Community lives and promotion to<br>Professor is the highest achievement in<br>in one's academic life and so we like to<br>celebrate that we like to hear from the<br>professor about the things that<br>contributed to their development and to<br>where they are today<br>because it requires special<br>um<br>special<br>um<br>Excellence across all of the three<br>components of an academic role of<br>teaching reserve and research and<br>service<br>measured by International standards we<br>get International referees to to judge<br>our professorial appointments in<br>addition requiring significant academic<br>leadership and Jonathan has shown all of<br>those characteristics and so it is it is<br>right and appropriate that we're here to<br>celebrate and I um<br>will also acknowledge that you have some<br>special guests attending tonight as well<br>through your parents Roland and

please<br>foreign<br>Professor Cooper and Professor Blakey<br>for that kind introduction<br>and thank you to my<br>friends my guests the guests here I<br>really appreciate your attendance to<br>come to listen to what I've got to say<br>this evening<br>so um in thinking about what I wanted to<br>uh talk about how I wanted to title this<br>talk I thought of the spine title of my<br>PhD thesis which I had called Kerry's<br>trajectories disparities the three main<br>things I think summarized what my PhD<br>thesis was about<br>but this is all built on one particular<br>study the Dunedin multi-disciplinary<br>health and development study so when<br>planning my talk I thought that I would<br>do something that looks a little bit<br>like this so this is my uh timeline for<br>my talk my outline<br>and this is constructed according to<br>um<br>naught to five the first dental<br>assessment in the Dunedin study was at<br>age five years<br>that was my early years of life<br>five to nine the next Dental assessment<br>was age nine that's where I learned my<br>three r's<br>then 9-15<br>um<br>where I developed some curiosity<br>I've found my direction towards<br>Dentistry between 15 and 18 which was<br>the fourth Dental assessment in the<br>Dunedin study<br>my Dental training began at age of 18<br>and it continues to this day I'm still<br>being dentally trained but our next<br>Dental assessment was at the age of 26.<br>and then my early research and this is<br>where I had the opportunity to become<br>involved in the Dunedin study for the<br>age 32 assessments and that was where I<br>began really my research career began in<br>earnest<br>uh and then when I became established in<br>my career<br>um between the ages of 32 and 38 and now<br>we're thinking about where we're headed<br>uh now and in the future so<br>um I'm now uh<br>um just hit the early 40s 41.<br>so<br>that's my rough outline for my talk<br>today<br>so I begin with my early years and so uh<br>this is my family my father Roland my<br>mother Carolyn and my two older siblings<br>in the first image there Christopher and<br>Julie and I'm the baby in the image I<br>was born in Australia my dad is a<br>pediatrician and we're from when new<br>zealanders but part of his pediatric<br>training was in Australia there I am in<br>a cardboard box sitting out in the<br>Australian Sun<br>and within a few short months we had<br>moved to Canada and they had an<br>extremely cold winter and there I am<br>dressed up for that<br>and then you can see here this is when<br>our family was complete with my um with<br>my younger brother James in the picture<br>um now um uh in New Zealand<br>called taraneki timonga irune taku Nako<br>taranik is the mountain I think of uh<br>when none<br>um it brings it's a mountain of that<br>brings me peace if you will and this is<br>myself and my younger brother James<br>standing in in front of Mount taranaki<br>I'll come back to this at the at the<br>very end of my talk but um uh we<br>originally lived in New Plymouth here is<br>me pointing out some lost teeth my two<br>lower Central incisors lost to some<br>pieces of Lego and I am wearing my bike<br>chain around my neck as uh as as would<br>be expected<br>so I know altipoti Ajo we moved to danen<br>and this is a postcard my grandfather<br>wrote me uh dear Jonathan I had uh uh to<br>go to the dentist yesterday get a tooth<br>pulled out<br>and it didn't hurt at all I had two<br>others filled and we'd love to see you<br>and then essentially love to see you but<br>we don't know when there will be now<br>this is me as a um as a young boy there<br>between moving from down to Dunedin my<br>hair changed color<br>and um uh things were never quite the<br>same again but I I started homeschooling<br>at this stage so um<br>we started homeschooling actually before<br>moving to Dunedin I'd been to school for<br>about 10 weeks and there were some<br>incidents that led to us<br>homeschooling and we homeschooled right<br>throughout these years<br>so<br>my<br>parents had the idea that they'd like to<br>teach teach us at home and so they did<br>we had a lot of opportunities in<br>homeschooling uh sort of between this is<br>between the ages of five and nine and<br>fifteen if you will<br>um I I was uh<br>um I grew my curiosity and my um<br>creativity in that time I learned to<br>play music I began playing the cello uh<br>Judy Davis My Cello teacher is here down<br>the front<br>um I uh got some of my old notes from<br>homeschooling as well I saw some uh<br>stuff I'd written you can see my<br>handwriting has devolved since then<br>I include a picture of the World Book<br>Encyclopedia because during my home<br>schooling years I<br>uh read it from end to end except we<br>were missing the volume CA to CH so I<br>don't know anything about Canada to<br>China<br>I um I also had a bit of a passion for a<br>um enjoyed um things science so that<br>image there is actually one of my<br>Rockets is pretty high up on the sky<br>there we might be able to see it um<br>on the image just about just about up<br>here somewhere<br>and this here is um is I was uh really<br>into<br>um uh hobbies and making things and this<br>is a chess set that I made I really<br>enjoyed playing games like that<br>so um that was sort of that period of my<br>life if you will<br>but then finding a direction finding a<br>direction towards Dentistry during my<br>early years I had been fascinated by<br>insects I wanted to be an entomologist I<br>told everybody this I I was interested<br>in the study of insects I wanted to do<br>zoology<br>until one day my mother said to me have<br>you ever thought about doing dentistry<br>and<br>I thought to myself that's exactly the<br>sort of career that I would like to um<br>uh to enter so I um immediately started<br>thinking about this and the next time I<br>went to the dentist to<br>Peter Ashton's dental surgery in Dunedin<br>um uh I asked him about this<br>unfortunately I needed to have a filling<br>at the time and this is my tooth here my<br>poor tooth one six which is uh restored<br>to the stay but he wrote in my notes<br>that he would um offer me a a job if I<br>got into dental school and I also asked<br>for a tour of the dental school and so<br>at that time the age of 16 I<br>um toured the dental school I met<br>Professor Jim hood and got to smash some<br>things on his Universal testing machine<br>I met Professor Nick Chandler and I got<br>to see his laser Doppler pulp tester and<br>I met some undergraduate Dental students<br>and had the opportunity to drill some<br>plastic teeth<br>now<br>um<br>I um I studied very hard during that<br>period because I was concerned about not<br>getting into dental school so I studied<br>extremely hard and was very focused<br>during that period of my life<br>um and uh<br>um by hooker by Croc I got onto dental<br>school and I learned a few things along<br>the way<br>one of the first things I learned at<br>dental school was the value of teacher<br>feedback so I<br>um one of my early assignments<br>was marked by a certain academic<br>Professor Tom karos<br>and he gave me some feedback which he<br>wrote all over my paper and I took that<br>feedback to heart and I<br>um I hadn't he had kept writing<br>repeatedly where's the evidence where is<br>the evidence he wrote repeatedly<br>throughout my paper I hadn't cited<br>enough literature<br>and so I learned from that and so the<br>next assignment I submitted that wasn't<br>um I<br>really enjoyed the writing side of this<br>I enjoyed writing my assignments I got a<br>bit of a curiosity for the science of<br>Dentistry one of my assignments<br>I have as an example this is from my<br>second year<br>I'm sorry mum but um it reads it was uh<br>the title of the assignment was cross<br>infection control<br>uh Syrian practical implementation of<br>cross-infection control and dental<br>practice the simple barriers last month<br>my mother attended a dental appointment<br>in my at my family's dental practice<br>here in Dunedin but the dentist is away<br>Anna Locum was taking care of his<br>patients the gentleman was unwell and<br>sneezed heavily during the appointment<br>you did not wear a mask it found it<br>necessary to use his pocket Hank Chief<br>twice during the appointment blowing his<br>nose without removing replacing or<br>washing his gloves you're going straight<br>back to the mouth with the soiled gloves<br>remarkably my mother did not complain at<br>the appointment but told me all about it<br>afterwards<br>so I built the assignment on that and<br>the these I enjoyed writing<br>but then taking opportunities for<br>research and so<br>um my father said to me uh one day he'd<br>um asked me what the frequency of<br>medical emergencies was in<br>um in dental practice<br>he'd been thinking about this in<br>Pediatrics and I asked<br>um Professor Dom cardos who was taking<br>my laboratory and he took me straight<br>down the hallway and introduced me to<br>this gentleman uh Professor Murray<br>Thompson<br>and I found in my filing cabinet the<br>other day the first piece of feedback<br>that Murray ever gave me which is<br>scribbled over surprisingly little there<br>actually considering um how much she<br>usually writes<br>but uh<br>upon asking this question we set off on<br>my first research project I was a bds2<br>student<br>and so far as I'm concerned I sort of<br>feel like I started my research career<br>with a bit of a hole in one<br>to use a golfing term because they are<br>from this paper I was awarded the nzda<br>award for research in no small part<br>thanks to the guidance completely thanks<br>to the guidance of Professor Murray<br>Thompson<br>um and this created some more<br>opportunities so um later on as a<br>undergraduate student a couple of years<br>later I then conducted a case control<br>study with Professor Murray Thompson and<br>Katie ears and pediatric dentist in the<br>field of looking at ADHD as a risk<br>factor attention deficit hyperactivity<br>disorder as a risk factor for dental<br>caries<br>now at this point after graduating from<br>dental school I was at a bit of an<br>impasse and I was all prepared to go to<br>a hospital job in um in Auckland<br>until<br>um I I I thought about it very carefully<br>my um<br>I was I I effectively decided that I was<br>going to go to Auckland but Murray<br>Thompson had suggested that maybe I<br>could stay here and uh work with him as<br>uh to help conduct the dental<br>examinations for the Dunedin study<br>and I'd all but made up my mind I got up<br>that one the morning of deciding and<br>looked at the horoscope for Sagittarius<br>and it said you're going to make a bad<br>career decision today<br>don't make any career decisions so I<br>decided that I was going to stay and I<br>was going to work I did not I I do not<br>believe in horoscopes so I did the<br>opposite<br>um so my PhD pathway I I um uh was<br>um it was wonderful to get the<br>opportunity to work with the Dunedin<br>multidisciplinary health and development<br>study I've uh the study members are now<br>uh in the in the early 50s<br>and when I became involved in the study<br>they were just commencing the age 32<br>Dental examinations<br>the leader of the study Professor Richie<br>multi-talented a team of people working<br>on that study are fantastic to work with<br>them<br>now<br>um<br>uh a fantastic opportunity because of<br>the nature of the danine study at scope<br>but also because it is World leading in<br>uh the fact that it includes extremely<br>good quality Digital Data due to the<br>foresight of<br>a dental academic who had Incorporated<br>Professor Harvey brown had Incorporated<br>Dental Assessments in the Dunedin study<br>from an early stage<br>so<br>um uh today there's um this is what<br>we're doing what we do what we did at<br>the age 45 assessments for example uh<br>with self-administered questionnaires<br>and a Comprehensive Dental examination<br>uh with a short interview with the<br>dentist we're Examining The Temper and<br>the jaw joint<br>uh examining people for oral hygiene<br>examining them for the state of their<br>teeth their gum health uh taking samples<br>of their plaque and also scanning the<br>teeth in 3D there's a image of how that<br>works here we sort of get dental<br>takeaways if you will so that we can<br>then<br>do further work with these images later<br>now in the early days of my involvement<br>with the danine study there was a little<br>bit of travel involved there was a<br>gentleman Professor a gentleman Mr Sean<br>Hogan that I had the pleasure of<br>traveling with this is him fishing on<br>the on the pier we had to travel to see<br>danine study members after seeing the<br>main bulk of the Dunedin Stadium members<br>here in Dunedin there were some that we<br>had to travel to see<br>and this was a really great way for me<br>to wet my teeth and research if you will<br>but it was uh was was really important<br>was the people who led me through that<br>and so Professor Murray Thompson was<br>there right throughout that together<br>with Professor Richie poulton here's a<br>image of um uh myself uh this was uh uh<br>this is uh Murray Thompson and one of<br>her early Dental conferences in Ireland<br>uh the other images more recent there's<br>an image of um Professor Richie poulton<br>and myself at uh 2004 or 2005 sorry<br>Dunedin study event<br>and more recently when the study was<br>awarded the Prime Minister science prize<br>and you'll also see there on one of my<br>other PhD supervisors the late professor<br>Jules kieser<br>who guided me as well through that time<br>now in my early time of the of research<br>with the Dunedin study one of the first<br>things I did was look at the data that<br>we already had the age 26 data<br>and what I was interested in doing was<br>looking at<br>um<br>I was I was interested in looking at<br>rates of tooth decay through life and so<br>I felt that I needed to know how I was<br>going to be measuring how much tooth<br>decay the Dunedin study members had<br>experienced<br>so as one of my assignments in<br>um I I began to work on this<br>and looked at different definitions<br>different ways of making the rules for<br>diagnosis of or classification of how<br>much tooth decay someone had experienced<br>so DMF refers to decayed missing and<br>filled<br>tooth surfaces or count of teeth and<br>then there's different ways to adjust<br>for how much tooth decay has occurred<br>between two time points adjusted carries<br>increment we use the term increment to<br>describe new Decay or a whatever the<br>method might be now that's quite<br>important because how you measure that<br>determines how wide or narrow the<br>inequalities you might observe by a<br>socioeconomic status and you want to be<br>able to<br>reasonably more accurately describe how<br>much tooth decay someone had actually<br>experienced and so that absolute<br>difference<br>in tooth decay experience could be<br>effectively almost doubled according to<br>how you are calculating that at the age<br>26 assessment<br>so I get on to that into trajectories<br>this is me and Rocket I was really I'm<br>still into Rockets I try to keep up with<br>what's happening in<br>um rocket science around the world<br>now um uh this was uh something I did<br>from that calculation<br>uh calculating the count of decayed<br>tooth surfaces by age in the Dunedin<br>study just looking at the permanent<br>teeth the adult teeth<br>and taken as an average using this uh<br>adjusted measure to account for how much<br>tooth decay the stadium members were<br>likely to have it gets confusing when a<br>person loses a tooth because a person<br>who loses a tooth loses the whole tooth<br>but often it's just a small part of the<br>tooth that is actually decayed<br>particularly for a low-income person a<br>person who has low income will have a<br>tooth with a small amount of Decay<br>extracted very early<br>um whereas that would be more severe for<br>a list for a more well-offed person<br>and so this was the beginnings of that<br>trajectory analysis work<br>this was an early version of it before<br>adjusting to a<br>more developed version and then so this<br>image here you can see the<br>how a certain proportion of the<br>population about 40 of these of this<br>study members had a low trajectory of<br>dental caries experience about 45 had a<br>relatively moderate trajectory and 15<br>had a high rate<br>and then when we look at the average<br>number of teeth lost due to tooth decay<br>by the age of 26 by childhood<br>socioeconomic status you've got a<br>difference there looking in that high<br>trajectory the high SES study members<br>who had a high rate of tooth decay lost<br>relatively few whereas the lower SES<br>Stadium the study members of lower<br>socioeconomic status lost fewer now the<br>proportional difference there is about<br>sort of um one two four one to five but<br>the absolute difference is sort of<br>almost less than a tooth<br>when we fast forward that to age of at<br>the age of 32 you'll see that the axis<br>down here has changed whereas before it<br>only went up to 1.5 now it goes up to<br>four so you can see here that the<br>difference in that high trajectory is<br>one versus three teeth<br>and through to the age of 38.<br>it's one and a half relative to five and<br>a half teeth<br>and through to the age of 45 more<br>recently so two versus nearly ten and so<br>you'll see that gradient across each of<br>these groups here in the way that tooth<br>decay is managed I'll come back to this<br>idea later because we will um<br>through the refine that but<br>um<br>and that started part of my PhD I am a<br>dentist and I really enjoyed the<br>research I really enjoyed the writing<br>looking at the numbers the statistics<br>but I felt to a certain extent I was<br>looking at teeth and numbers and I felt<br>that I might be criticized for not being<br>a real dentist and so I started working<br>part-time in private practice but more<br>more importantly for I think development<br>developmentally for me was that I<br>decided I want to<br>see Dentistry more broadly and I visited<br>the Pacific<br>I visited the Pacific for the first time<br>and I<br>I I<br>meant to say a big venaka Vaca levu to<br>the people of Fiji really made a<br>difference to me this is with some uh<br>Dental therapists from the Fijian<br>Ministry of Health who are visiting a<br>school this was one of the first things<br>they did over there visiting a school in<br>Fiji and this was later on the same on<br>the same trip<br>uh you can see there operating under a<br>light bulb<br>with a relatively poor quality headlamp<br>and it was a beautiful country I<br>returned a number of times four times to<br>Fiji and two times to Papua New Guinea<br>and I've got every intention of<br>returning<br>it's a little bit difficult to do it at<br>the moment while I've got children but<br>that was what I spent my holidays doing<br>now<br>um uh one particular trip I was um<br>um I think it was the third time I'd<br>been<br>um I was visited by a<br>man who was about my age she was early<br>30s so I was I was in my late 20s at the<br>time and<br>he was with his two sisters and this<br>gentleman<br>was<br>um<br>um<br>uh non-verbal it had an injury<br>as a as a teenager he had been washing<br>the river heard a noise above him looked<br>up and was hit in the face by a coconut<br>and it really destroyed him and so this<br>particular gentleman<br>um he had come to see me and<br>needed to have his remaining teeth<br>removed it was um extremely unhealthy it<br>was a little shards of glass in sort of<br>bleeding jelly if you will it was very<br>very unpleasant and difficult to deal<br>with for him I spent quite a bit of time<br>with this gentleman once had finished<br>helping him he got up and left I thought<br>I'd never see him again now on the last<br>day of visiting that particular Village<br>I was on a boat and<br>I had contracted uh tummy bug quite a<br>bad tummy bug and I decided that I was<br>not going to go to the feast that<br>evening<br>until I heard that there was someone on<br>the beach waiting for me<br>um and so I thought well I'd I'd better<br>go I've eaten something that I shouldn't<br>have eaten but um<br>I got on the boat it was Pitch Black<br>there was no there was only one light<br>bulb in the village of about 300 people<br>and that's where everybody was so I had<br>my headlight on and I headed into the uh<br>into the onto the island and there was a<br>man waiting in the water up to his<br>armpits who grabbed the front of the<br>boat when I came near dragged the boat<br>into the shore and it was this man who<br>had just two days before removed his<br>teeth<br>and he um<br>gave me a hug and turned around and<br>walked into the bush<br>this the um they it had such an effect<br>on me uh that um<br>it made me realize I guess uh and I<br>often think about that ex that um uh<br>that interaction what it meant for that<br>person to have his painful teeth fixed<br>and I wonder how he is and I wonder<br>what's happening uh I wonder what his<br>life is and living on a on a on an<br>island essentially with only one<br>generator to supply that particular<br>Island<br>now return many times uh so a number of<br>times these are some images from Papua<br>New Guinea<br>and this is<br>um as a as a researcher I couldn't sort<br>of help but collect some data on the<br>people that I helped and this was from<br>uh<br>um uh one particular trip where I worked<br>together with Craig Waterhouse<br>um<br>um<br>and I am<br>uh collected<br>on the average number of teeth that were<br>decayed uh<br>for each age group for the um for the uh<br>so the people 200 people<br>and comparing with and now this is not a<br>representative sample of course of<br>people from Papua New Guinea these are<br>the people from The Villages that I saw<br>and this was how much tooth decay they<br>had and this was how many missing teeth<br>they had at Baseline before we before we<br>turned up to help them so the<br>um of the children aged 11 to 20 that we<br>saw or the adolescence that we saw the<br>average number of decayed teeth each was<br>eight uh compared that with a sort of a<br>proximate figure from The New Zealand<br>Health survey where we'd be very<br>concerned if we were seeing<br>um uh you know one if you will and most<br>of the that decay has been managed<br>nicely with fillings whereas in Papua<br>New Guinea we're not seeing any of that<br>so on to a more brighter things so<br>establishing my career this is an image<br>of when I graduated my PhD in 2010<br>together with Jennifer Doss and Lindy<br>Foster page we're all supervised<br>together by uh the brilliant Murray<br>Thompson<br>and it was about this time as well that<br>I<br>was<br>lucky enough to be awarded that nzda a<br>young dentist award this is a a walker<br>proud that they had carved as the um<br>supposed to be something uh the the<br>so some other research that I've uh that<br>I've done and the research I was doing<br>around about this time this is a paper<br>from uh 2010 2011.<br>uh Dental plaque and oral health<br>throughout in the in the first 32 years<br>of life we're quite interested in<br>um uh the modifiable risk factors for<br>tooth decay and we're very excited what<br>I'm very excited about what's happening<br>now with moves to make toothbrushes and<br>toothpaste more accessible to New<br>Zealand children because often those who<br>are those habits are set quite early in<br>life so we looked at lifetime<br>trajectories of plaque so we looked at a<br>number of different applications of<br>group based trajectory modeling<br>including modeling Dental plaque<br>Dental visiting<br>and dental anxiety as well<br>and so um we found some quite striking<br>differences in<br>um<br>periodontal disease by long-term plaque<br>levels so for study members with<br>high levels of plaque who were smokers<br>they risk was greatly enhanced for those<br>who had high plaque levels who were<br>non-smokers it was only moderately<br>enhanced this is because of the way<br>smoking interacts with<br>um the the hygiene environment to<br>exacerbate the the issues<br>to depress the host response<br>and so that we found the same sort of<br>thing with dental caries and tooth loss<br>the same sort of gradients keep<br>reappearing<br>it was also about this time that I made<br>a lovely young lady Isabella and this is<br>her on one of our trips to this was at<br>the World Congress of epidemiology in<br>Alaska where she joined me and so I've<br>put some images here of something I<br>learned at dental school I applied some<br>some techniques I learned as a bds2<br>student in in the um in the in the lab<br>using some wax and then investing that<br>to pour it in a hard acrylic<br>to cut into a shape to start to build<br>some wax on that to get a 15 cent cubic<br>zirconia<br>together with<br>um and spruing that and investing that<br>to cast it in 15 of Palladium alloy<br>um<br>and<br>um so if this is it here that was the<br>end result and um so that's some some of<br>um I made our wedding rings as well I<br>unfortunately threw mine into the<br>rubbish it came off in a glove I<br>shouldn't have had it on under my gloves<br>and that is at somewhere in the skip at<br>dental school about<br>now it was just as well that I had<br>Isabella's support because this was<br>around about the time I got into the<br>fluoridation business as well this was a<br>challenging time I had a lot of media<br>engagements and a lot of advice given to<br>professional agencies<br>and we'd published a paper in the<br>American Journal of Public Health about<br>one aspect of community water<br>fluoridation that had come under<br>challenge where people had claimed that<br>it was associated with detrimental<br>um if you um that would be a whole<br>nother talk to get deep into that but<br>suffice to say uh there's another new<br>study just from Australia that some<br>concurs with our funding so this was a<br>relatively influential paper now I went<br>on from this to the sort of Spawn some<br>other lines of research as well<br>with respect to exposure to lead in the<br>extra pathway as a one advantage of<br>working in a multi-disciplinary study<br>like this<br>I also got interested in other potential<br>exposures quite interested in Mercury<br>exposure and quite interested in looking<br>at that I think there's possibilities<br>for looking at that in a study like the<br>Dunedin study in the future as well so<br>new ideas are always coming<br>now um<br>I sort of segue from that because this<br>was a beliefs thing and I'd previously<br>published before the um the fluoridation<br>thing really got kicked off<br>I looked at oral health beliefs in<br>adolescence and in young adulthood one<br>of the a couple of the beliefs that we<br>looked at was associated with whether<br>using fluoro toothpaste helps prevent<br>tooth decay whether drinking fluoridated<br>water helps prevent tooth care certainly<br>a lot of people in the Dunedin study<br>um<br>often change their minds or they felt<br>that some of these things like using<br>dental floss for example was not<br>important we found that the people that<br>thought that these things weren't<br>important were less likely to engage in<br>those behaviors but also that there were<br>differences in health associated with<br>those with those beliefs so this was an<br>earlier paper which we Then followed up<br>with another paper<br>where we use structural equation<br>modeling to<br>look at this through life looking at<br>those<br>the the the<br>intergenerational aspect looking at the<br>study members parents beliefs about<br>looking after the teeth their<br>association with the study members<br>beliefs themselves the study members<br>socioeconomic status during childhood<br>and its association with adult<br>socioeconomic status<br>the association of these things with<br>tooth brushing with use of dental<br>services and then the association of all<br>of these things with<br>um<br>tooth decay<br>tooth loss and ultimately oral health<br>related quality of life that's where it<br>all really matters is because of its uh<br>oral health is important because it<br>now um my<br>um<br>um current uh this is a a couple of<br>images here I am now a little bit<br>involved in journal editing I've been a<br>fairly active reviewer for a lot of<br>journals for a considerable amount of<br>time I've reviewed over 300<br>um manuscripts<br>for different journals and that has<br>spawned into opportunities to be<br>involved in editorships there's an image<br>of uh uh Casper my two-year-old who made<br>it onto the cover of the New Zealand<br>Dental journal and some other things I'm<br>currently working on a artwork if it<br>goes according to plan I have a pinhole<br>camera on top of the dental school which<br>I consider to be the site of the<br>original Dunedin study and I'm hopeful<br>that part two of the longitudinal issue<br>of the Royal Society Journal that if my<br>image turns out acceptably I will plan<br>to include that on the cover so a<br>pinhole of six months of the sun over<br>the over Dunedin<br>a longitudinal image with lovely paths<br>I'm hoping to see<br>now I've talked about myself a lot here<br>and that's that's a fault uh the future<br>is really um I need to start thinking<br>about what<br>Murray Richie Jules others have done for<br>me<br>and what the future should be for<br>other people and so postgraduate<br>students undergraduate students involved<br>in research giving opportunities for<br>them these are some of my current and<br>past students<br>and so I'll just give a few examples<br>here<br>publishing with some undergraduate<br>students this is some work that we did<br>looking at one of my lines of interest<br>is survival of dental fillings and so<br>this here is outcomes for teeth after<br>having the nerves taken out of them at<br>our dental school and what the survival<br>curves look like<br>also I followed up there was a 1994<br>study on New Zealand dentists<br>cross-infection control practices and so<br>we conducted a update for the first time<br>in published in 2019 looking at what<br>those practices are now the proportion<br>of dentists who now always wear gloves<br>or at least at the time that we<br>conducted that survey it would be very<br>interesting to look at that again post<br>covert there were certainly still some<br>gaps there<br>at that time this was self-report of<br>course<br>um now one of my PhD students begonia is<br>looking at<br>um<br>data from the Dunedin multiducibility<br>study and she's published a couple of<br>papers from her PhD looking at childhood<br>oral health there's a canary in the coal<br>mine for poor adult General Health using<br>data from the Dunedin study and the<br>Christchurch development study as well<br>also moving to a new version of group<br>based trajectory modeling where we can<br>split out effectively have three<br>dependent variables at once and model<br>not just total carries experience but<br>the the really much more interesting<br>aspect of differential access to dental<br>care<br>and so you'll see here that um there are<br>different groups here who<br>have either a<br>um<br>a low rate of tooth decay with<br>relatively few fillings a moderate rate<br>of tooth decay with either quite a few<br>fillings or a little bit more tooth loss<br>and untreated tooth decay or here we've<br>got<br>um another group that's the high rates<br>of tooth decay one of which has<br>um<br>one of which has a lot of fillings one<br>of which has a lot of tooth loss and one<br>of which has a lot of untreated tooth<br>decay<br>some of my other postgraduate students<br>Emma Morelli she looked at whether<br>having children is associated with<br>women's oral health this is something<br>that's a common claim that you have to<br>give a tooth per child if you will and<br>one of the things that we found was that<br>study members who had<br>children early<br>relatively early who tended to<br>they tended to be social things<br>associated with that but they were at<br>greatest risk so what this says to us is<br>that young mothers especially need<br>protection and support<br>in in making that in their own oral<br>health and in helping their children to<br>adopt healthy behaviors<br>uh one of my uh Masters students and the<br>master of community Dentistry looking at<br>inequalities in rates of access to rates<br>of GA in the um<br>Auckland region this is the rate per<br>thousand children<br>for Pacific and Maori at 10 children per<br>thousand and the five to nine age<br>bracket relative to European children at<br>uh Ludwig Jensen Van Born and his work<br>this is a uh as a dental technician<br>and I found myself uh collaborating with<br>him and supervising him on his PhD<br>initially because of the use of the<br>scanner that we had purchased for use in<br>the Dunedin multi-disciplinary study and<br>research begets research and we started<br>using that scanner in this in this work<br>and in this piece of work he's looking<br>at<br>stress on teeth by the contact area size<br>the the surface area that that of the<br>teeth that contact with each other and<br>also looking at how much the teeth<br>compress when you bite them bite down on<br>them why don't teeth break even more<br>than they do they're hard and brittle<br>and if they didn't compress into the<br>periodontal ligament space if they<br>didn't bounce a little bit then maybe<br>with a fraction more teeth than we do<br>um I'd just like to point out that I<br>achieved<br>um<br>and Angela been one of my PhD students<br>working with the Dunedin<br>multi-disciplinary study as well she's<br>looked at some very challenging data<br>with respect to the oral microbiome<br>um at the that was collected at the age<br>32 assessments very challenging data to<br>analyze we've just had some papers we've<br>had some papers accepted one paper<br>published from that and another just<br>accepted on<br>Kerry's increment according to<br>differences in the microbiome there's<br>some very interesting findings there<br>with respect to specific bacteria and<br>the risks associated with those<br>uh Simon Oliver are one of my completed<br>decal and Dent students<br>another study with the Dunedin uh<br>another a couple of papers with the<br>Dunedin study looking at occlusal<br>features and temporary mandibular joint<br>clicking<br>orthodontists like to correct<br>malocclusions and one of the claims that<br>sometimes made from correcting<br>malocclusions is that correction of<br>malocclusions may result in less risk of<br>jaw joint clicking we've found that<br>that's not necessarily so and in fact<br>some features that orthodontists might<br>want to correct are actually possibly<br>protective<br>we've also looked at stability of the<br>incisor relationship and how teeth move<br>how the front teeth shift around in<br>a research fellow who's worked with me<br>quite extensively on the age 38<br>assessments and Beyond<br>one of her numerous projects looking at<br>long-term survival of teeth affected by<br>developmental defects of enamel we've<br>got data from age nine of when the teeth<br>were had patches on them if you will<br>developmental patches on the teeth these<br>patches might be due to having had an<br>abscess or injury or they might be due<br>to something like and that is what<br>you'll observe with demarcated opacities<br>they're more likely to end up with<br>fillings on the other hand teeth with<br>diffuse opacities so the front teeth<br>with diffuse opacities or hypoplasia or<br>combinations of defects more likely to<br>be restored but the back teeth less<br>likely to be restored that's in cases<br>where there could be fluorosis<br>uh Deanna bicketts with her PhD thesis<br>looking at Vitamin D exposure it's<br>another longitudinal study not the<br>Dunedin study very interesting study<br>looking at um<br>zaina is a former Syrian refugee and<br>dentist who I'm lucky enough to have<br>supervised her through her Decline dint<br>and she has published she's published a<br>couple of papers from this work where<br>she did a six-month follow-up following<br>an oral health promotion intervention<br>among former Syrian refugees and we<br>achieved some<br>lovely differences we did a intervention<br>and Then followed up they designed their<br>own oral health education resources and<br>then we sent them back to them over a<br>period of six months so they designed<br>them and then we sent them back to<br>remind them of what they designed and lo<br>and behold when they after six months<br>they had lower Clark scores less<br>bleeding on probing and some of their<br>pockets their gum Pockets had zipped up<br>I'm really interested in health<br>promotion this is some work that I'm<br>currently doing with some lovely<br>colleagues I said I'd come back to manga<br>taranaki at the end myself Coulda and<br>Sam<br>Curry Lacy Sam Carrington we have<br>connections in taranaki we've been<br>working on a uh on a book A book about<br>oral health<br>funded by the medical Assurance Society<br>Foundation it doesn't matter that KIA<br>don't live on taranaki it's not<br>important what's important is that we've<br>made a lovely story there's a Proto Don<br>topdrix Ruth a ruthai it's a recently<br>discovered New Zealand<br>toothed or proto-toothed bird that we're<br>incorporating into the story about a Kia<br>that's grown a tooth or has it grown a<br>tooth<br>um<br>so<br>um now I'm I'm at the end of my talk<br>um uh what's all about<br>preventive preventive services and<br>enhanced access to uh Dental Care<br>um that's what that's what's really<br>needed now the sort of a a<br>thought I'd finish with a<br>um<br>line I learned in Papua New Guinea and<br>I'll pronounce it incorrectly<br>look out and teeth belong you me<br>brush them teeth long ago today<br>long stopping teeth bugger up<br>brush your teeth every day and they'll<br>help you from stopping them from getting<br>damaged<br>so<br>um uh I I sort of finish with some<br>acknowledgments so acknowledgments to my<br>parents my parents my mother<br>was a long-suffering homeschooling me<br>and supported me through making sure<br>that I did my homeschool work and my dad<br>is the most patient person that I could<br>have ever met<br>I've got a lovely family with a lovely<br>wife Isabella and four children who are<br>all a lot of fun so thank you Lawrence<br>and Harold for sitting through and being<br>very good<br>thank you to<br>um<br>Murray Thompson<br>I wouldn't have had a career in Academia<br>if it hadn't been for Mary Thompson's<br>support<br>it's completely all down to him together<br>with the support of other people such as<br>Professor Richie poulton his down the<br>bottom is an image of myself with Lindy<br>Foster page EF Shalom Caspian to Timmy<br>moffatt where we accidentally ran into<br>each other in London so they are also<br>very important people who've given me a<br>lot of support throughout my career<br>um thank you uh to friends at the dental<br>school those who are named and those who<br>are not listed there's many people who<br>have given me a lot of support whether<br>it be in clinical advice on difficult<br>cases or with respect to research uh<br>thank you to the funders I've taken a<br>lot of support from the New Zealand<br>Dental Association Research Foundation<br>and also have received funding from<br>other sources as well including health<br>research Council<br>and and um but uh at I guess<br>foundationally uh thank you to the<br>University of otago for um<br>um being the institution that has given<br>me a career so<br>thank you<br>thank you very much Jonathan for a very<br>entertaining and edifying talk very<br>difficult to summarize 100 Publications<br>in in just an hour but you've done a<br>wonderful job<br>not only in uh showing us what you've<br>done but the the diversity of your<br>interests including the uh lovely<br>cartoons at the end<br>um Jonathan started at dental school<br>about the same time that I started as a<br>as a teacher and a little bit unusual<br>because I can actually remember him as<br>an undergraduate though I didn't<br>supervise any of his his research<br>projects at that point<br>uh distinctive because of his um rather<br>understated way of asking questions uh<br>in the in the microbiology Labs but I<br>actually realized he was trying to<br>distract me from looking too carefully<br>at his at his lab book<br>and<br>uh anyway<br>um<br>I think another very uh<br>notable<br>part of<br>of JB's career is the uh<br>the the part of our job description<br>which says something about conscience of<br>society<br>and JB has not uh not retreated from<br>this at all he's taken on uh various<br>people and that<br>as as as Paul outlined he has the manner<br>to do that but it takes more than that<br>it takes some<br>all right<br>metatoha I think is the word to uh to to<br>do that so we very much appreciate that<br>uh what was also perhaps a little<br>um understated was that he's done all<br>this while raising for children for<br>young children and<br>um<br>that is another aspect that takes up<br>your evenings<br>I was going somewhere with that but I<br>um<br>yes because uh if you've ever been into<br>Jonathan's office where sometimes he has<br>to play a babysitter<br>you can<br>come up to date with the latest in Lego<br>technology which<br>um has always kept me entertained anyway<br>before we let you go uh JB we have a a<br>Wii token here of appreciation<br>and<br>all right Kiora Koso<br>um I'm the last<br>I'm Trish priest I'm the acting Pro Vice<br>Chancellor of Health Sciences at the<br>moment and I'm a public health<br>epidemiologist so I've had a little bit<br>to do with Jonathan bumping into him at<br>meetings and things over the years<br>although we don't we don't<br>work together enough I think dental and<br>public health epidemiologists but<br>um it's always been interesting to talk<br>to him and I once caged a ride home from<br>the airport in his amazing vehicle which<br>was really a highlight of my airport<br>traveling experiences so it's really<br>great to hear about more about what<br>you've<br>done in your professional and personal<br>life and that was a really excellent and<br>interesting IPO thank you so much so I'm<br>going to in a moment ask you to thank<br>Jonathan one more time and then to come<br>and have Refreshments at the staff Club</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
