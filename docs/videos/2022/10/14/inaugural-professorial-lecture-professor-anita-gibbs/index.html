my<br>name's Helen Nicholson on the deputy<br>Vice Chancellor academic of the<br>University of otago and it's my pleasure<br>to welcome you all to this special<br>occasion to celebrate the promotion of<br>Anita Gibbs to Professor<br>and it's good to see so many of Anita's<br>colleagues from sociology gender studies<br>and criminology and social and Community<br>work it must be the longest title for a<br>department in the University I think so<br>thank you for coming and to those from<br>The Wider University as well as students<br>and Friends<br>but today I'd like to give a very<br>special welcome to Anita's family her<br>husband Mike daughter Lillian and<br>sandima who hopefully are with us in<br>person today and her son Ruslan and<br>other members of the family who are in<br>the UK who are doing it joining us by<br>live stream so welcome it's great to<br>have you with us<br>it would be fair to say that we don't<br>make um being promoted to a professor<br>atargo very easy<br>um and in order to be promoted you have<br>to demonstrate leadership and sustained<br>outstanding competence in the areas of<br>research teaching and service<br>and associate professor Marcel Dawson is<br>shortly going to give you a formal<br>introduction to Anita but I just want to<br>say a few words to set the scene because<br>Anita has shown excellence in all of<br>those three areas she's an experienced<br>teacher and a great postgraduate<br>supervisor<br>and as a trained social worker her<br>research explores the impacts on people<br>of their involvement with complex social<br>systems and in particular in the area of<br>fetal alcohol spectrum disorder of A.D<br>her work in the area of fasd has<br>resulted in evidence-based interventions<br>that have made a difference to The Wider<br>community<br>and two years ago I was delighted to be<br>there when she was awarded the<br>prestigious critic and conscious award<br>funded by the gamma foundation and<br>universities New Zealand for her work in<br>raising the awareness of fasd and the<br>disability the long-term disability that<br>it causes<br>so Anita<br>um thank you for your many contributions<br>to the university and in particular to<br>The Wider Community<br>congratulations on your richly deserved<br>promotion<br>Professor Nicholson<br>Professor Gibbs tenakoto katoa<br>I'm so pleased that we were able to<br>reschedule this event without too much<br>fuss and uh thankfully the weather is<br>cooperating I mean for now at least so<br>so we'll see it as it is Dunedin<br>um now normally I wouldn't thank people<br>when they're unwell but Professor Claire<br>Freeman thank you for having a lingering<br>illness and for stepping aside because<br>that has enabled me to have this<br>opportunity to introduce my colleague<br>Professor Anita Gibbs<br>as most of you know Anita grew up in the<br>UK she completed her o levels and a<br>levels in Exeter in the early 1980s and<br>in 1991 undertook a certificate in<br>social work at the University of Bristol<br>around this time Anita worked as a<br>probation officer in Bristol and<br>completed another certificate this time<br>in women's studies through the open<br>University in 1993.<br>not being able to resist the lure and<br>the temptation of higher education Anita<br>enrolled at Bristol for a PhD in policy<br>studies and social work which he<br>completed in 1996.<br>a wee trip to aotearoa in 1994 clearly<br>sparked something in Anita because she<br>returned to these shows in 1999 with her<br>husband Mike and daughter Lillian<br>to take up a lecturing position here at<br>the University of otago in what was then<br>Social Work community and family studies<br>inspired largely by Anita's academic<br>Endeavors around adoption and mental<br>health she and Mike made the decision to<br>adopt not one but two babies a pair of<br>brothers from Russia as we heard earlier<br>Dima is here in the audience with us and<br>I believe Ruslan has joined online<br>reflecting just recently on that<br>decision to adopt the boys Anita said<br>this<br>once you realize how many children have<br>no chance at life it becomes a natural<br>desire to try and remedy that<br>I've known Anita for about a decade<br>which is just less than half her time<br>here at otago and in that time I've come<br>to know Anita the person and Anita The<br>Professional<br>taking stock of Anita's background I can<br>honestly say that for her the profession<br>there's the personal is both<br>professional and fiercely political<br>those of you who know Anita's work will<br>know how deeply committed she is to<br>debunking the myths around fetal alcohol<br>spectrum disorder<br>Beyond her impressive record of more<br>than 150 scholarly outputs on fasd and<br>other topics Anita has worked tirelessly<br>with a range of government departments<br>ngos and social agencies within and<br>Beyond New Zealand as well as a number<br>of Ministries to improve the life<br>chances of those living with fasd<br>specifically and with nearer<br>disabilities more generally<br>for instance in 2018 to 2019<br>Anita served as senior advisor to a<br>Ministry of Health initiated fasd<br>training and implementation project and<br>then from 2021 to 2022 she advised the<br>Ministry of Education on their project<br>flexible supports for neurod disability<br>include sorry using inclusive design<br>Anita's efforts in relation to fasd have<br>been rewarded with several research<br>grants over the course of her career but<br>the note most notable recognition of her<br>work as Professor Nicholson mentioned<br>just before came in the form of the<br>critic and conscience award which she<br>received in 2020. those who aren't<br>familiar with the award it is sponsored<br>by the philanthropic trust the gamma<br>foundation and administered by<br>universities New Zealand now just<br>quoting from their website the prize of<br>fifty thousand dollars is awarded<br>annually to an academic staff member who<br>in the opinion of a panel of three<br>independent judges has done more in the<br>past two calendar years than any other<br>applicant to provide the public with<br>independent expert commentary<br>on an issue or issues affecting the New<br>Zealand Community or future Generations<br>to me Anita is the consummate scholar<br>activist at a very deserving recipient<br>of the critic and conscience award<br>driven by a deep personal commitment<br>Anita is determined to translate her<br>intellectual Endeavors around<br>neurodesability into meaningful tangible<br>social change and I'm so pleased that we<br>were able together here this evening to<br>listen to her inaugural professorial<br>lecture on the criminalization of<br>Children and Youth with neuro<br>disabilities in aotearoa New Zealand<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>Gibbs<br>that's the problem of being a Caped<br>Crusader<br>namihike<br>thank you so much for your introductions<br>um just uh like to do my uh<br>um<br>so I just want to say Obviously thank<br>you for those wonderful introductions<br>and to the whole university community<br>for the privilege and opportunity to<br>celebrate this moment but also the<br>chance to thank<br>um you know my family obviously an<br>interesting and diverse family but but<br>my other families as well I have<br>multiple new families in the in the<br>field of near diversity and to celebrate<br>also my colleagues present and past as<br>well who've influenced my personal<br>career and research choices because<br>everybody plays A Part<br>um and even if it's a small part all of<br>these things lead me to the place where<br>I described my Mountain<br>um Dartmoor well um a lovely National<br>Park in the southwest of the UK but I<br>feel<br>um very humbled to be in such a great<br>company so thank you for those of you<br>who have arrived in person thank you to<br>those of you who I know who've got it<br>early because you did last week so<br>you've got up early again in the UK at 5<br>30. and thank you to those others I know<br>who also online from various parts of<br>the the world and also who will want to<br>listen later because you've said make<br>sure we get that link I would like to<br>say hello to mum and Brian in particular<br>and happy birthday Brian my stepfather<br>today so this first slide shows my<br>Mountain as I mentioned in my Mickey and<br>beside it is Dartmoor prison<br>in a national park and it's a a working<br>prison a prison with a lot of um history<br>and a lot of dark history but stories of<br>um chaos and despair<br>um and maybe hope sometimes I've spent<br>time there<br>I've spent time there as a prison<br>visitor as a probation officer visiting<br>those who unfortunately can't yet get<br>out but hopefully are on their way out<br>and I began voluntary prison visiting<br>when I was 18 years old I just I think<br>something about<br>um seeing prisons I saw them I always<br>saw them early you know drew me to think<br>who's behind those walls how can I<br>connect with people who are excluded<br>from society is there anything<br>um that I can do and so it started a<br>lifelong journey I guess with this topic<br>in many ways that we're we're sort of<br>looking at today<br>I want to draw on aspect of my research<br>in criminal justice and social work as<br>well as my experience as a social worker<br>and some of my family's own lived<br>experiences of neurodesability and the<br>interactions within multiple systems to<br>bring this topic to you it's because of<br>the interaction of our many hats as<br>mentioned by my lovely colleagues social<br>worker academic mum and more recently an<br>avid disability Advocate that I can<br>basically bring the topic to you and<br>hopefully give you some insights into<br>processes that both help and hinder how<br>we treat thousands of Children and Youth<br>in arteroa who live with neurodesability<br>and a range of neurodivergent conditions<br>that could be autism could be ADHD I<br>know obviously it can be fasd fetal<br>alcohol Spectrum Disorder there are many<br>others we can't talk about them more but<br>they're always research areas in their<br>own right<br>so yes language matters terminology can<br>be fraught it has a lot of emphasis on<br>deficit and lack often a lot of negative<br>emphasis but in order to understand<br>oppression and discrimination we need to<br>recognize that people with disabilities<br>are often viewed as having deficits<br>being in deficit lacking the ability to<br>function as normal whatever that is not<br>only physically but cognitively and<br>often to get the supports to live well<br>they have to be defined as impaired and<br>disabled and so it becomes very easy to<br>blame people for their own impairments<br>and then unfortunately potentially to<br>treat them punitively particularly if<br>they don't look disabled people living<br>with a range of neurodeabilities and<br>neurodivergent conditions rarely look<br>disabled they need the sort of need to<br>other is very apparent here when talking<br>about fasd in particular I often hear<br>people say it's a hidden disability so I<br>want to apologize in advance<br>um because I know there will be plenty<br>of neurodivergent people in these<br>audiences<br>um if I use any language or defense<br>because I'm still learning and I'm aware<br>of international use of first-person<br>language for example in some countries<br>person with FSD person with autism<br>but then<br>also you know people might use prefer to<br>use identity first I am autistic because<br>there's a pride in that identity people<br>are reclaiming you know the pride in the<br>identity of their beautiful brain<br>difference so that is very important as<br>well so I may make a few mistakes and I<br>am happy to be corrected at a later<br>point you know once we go for a we<br>nibble after this event<br>um so today I want to start with a brief<br>mention of my 13 year old hero my son<br>Dima who's now 18. it's given me<br>permission to offer a few personal<br>Reflections as we go along about his<br>story he's proudly russian-born came to<br>up to our family back in 2007 after a<br>long journey for Mike and I<br>um to and Lillian because Lilian always<br>used to say these are my brothers from<br>Russia I've adopted them so she was all<br>in um so it was a long journey to adopt<br>both Dima and Ruslan and just before his<br>14th birthday because he's never short<br>of a few things to say he joined me at a<br>law conference and I remember Mark<br>Hennigan was there and he gave a short<br>presentation about fasd actually Muslim<br>did too fast forward another five years<br>and Dima is now what we would call<br>partly a survivor of processes of<br>criminalization and stigmatization which<br>have occurred to him but also occur<br>every day in our land to thousands of<br>vulnerable children who live with<br>neurodivergent conditions so my basic<br>position is that in RT a role we're not<br>quite getting it right we're probably a<br>long way from getting it right for<br>Children and Youth who live with autism<br>fasd ADHD brain injuries<br>um have dyslexia other learning<br>challenges and what we often call high<br>and complex needs for these children and<br>youth their needs often remain<br>unidentified misdiagnosed misunderstood<br>sometimes abused unfortunately this<br>failure to acknowledge autumn understand<br>has serious repercussions and for many<br>will lead to what Eileen baldry and and<br>colleagues in Australia called cruel and<br>unusual punishment as they head down<br>this Pathway to criminalization so the<br>rest of my talk will show how processes<br>of criminalization occur how children<br>get stuck in the youth justice system<br>the hidden and obvious costs of getting<br>stuck and then how to build ramps<br>instead of walls drawing on Research<br>that I've undertaken in the last 12<br>months with 90 plus caregivers and<br>disability stakeholders for those youth<br>living with neurodesabilities<br>particularly fasd for me I take a social<br>model approach to disability which<br>considers primary impairments that fail<br>to be accommodated by systems structures<br>and people and this lack of<br>accommodating can be disabling I also<br>use a disability rights framework which<br>challenges every system to ensure that<br>those who are particularly vulnerable<br>are given the means to participate<br>fairly and equitably and to have<br>well-being and to live a good life as<br>those of us who are neurotypical and<br>privileged are mostly able to do<br>so a philosopher from Bristol because<br>Bristol is a good place Professor Haley<br>Carrell writes in the area of disability<br>and different forms of Justice to<br>describe youth like Dima as having<br>virtue in deficit because in spite of<br>insurmountable challenges and obstacles<br>children living with neurodivergent<br>conditions still try to fit in much of<br>the time they don't understand the<br>unspoken rules of fitting in of the<br>neurotypical world what is the box of<br>the neurotypical world no one explains<br>that world to them and even if they did<br>it would be the wrong world because it's<br>a one-size-fits-all approach it's not<br>their reality often for these children<br>education can be very painful<br>non-inclusive and peers and adults can<br>start to reject neurodivergent children<br>from quite a young age I've observed<br>that time and time again and also<br>because their new disability is<br>undiagnosed or even if it is when there<br>are no or few accommodations to even<br>turn up to school can be considered a<br>heroic act these children are heroes<br>because they often experience daily<br>rejection<br>from an early age and huge anxiety and<br>yet they still try to fit in even when<br>they don't feel safe in our education<br>care and youth Justice systems they are<br>apparently have to make this not bump<br>the microphone so some background issues<br>up until very recently New Zealand's<br>kind of official care system has had<br>well over 6 000 or so children in care<br>in a mix of long-term and short-term<br>caregiving situations living in Foster<br>families with relatives in supported<br>living arrangements run by ngos and<br>non-government organizations or in<br>around tamariki homes and Residences<br>including the lock residences or<br>lock-ups as the kids call them<br>unofficially many more thousands of<br>children also living with relatives and<br>some children who were in care are now<br>in what we call home for Life<br>Arrangements post formal care so care<br>experienced and also like us those<br>adopted here and overseas Children and<br>Youth are Inc who are care experienced<br>have usually experienced Early Childhood<br>trauma neglect developmental delays<br>early systemic adversity as well as a<br>less unfortunately less than optimal<br>prenatal environment<br>Children and Youth who are care<br>experienced are often disproportionately<br>Maori and as we are now learning<br>disproportionately near a disabled<br>little data is collected about the<br>disability needs of children in care<br>currently only 12 percent are recorded<br>as having a disability<br>whereas in aotearoa our own Ministry of<br>Health estimates up to half of children<br>in care may live with a newer disability<br>this is a big gap reports on children<br>and Care in Australia New Zealand and<br>the UK show that Justice systems<br>unfortunately are full of people with<br>care experience who have special and<br>complex needs<br>and unfortunately they've had you know<br>violence and poverty in their<br>backgrounds they've often suffered<br>intergenerational abuse neglect and harm<br>and they've often had multiple<br>placements in care and not have<br>long-term stable placements they often<br>get arrested early and have early<br>contact with the police and<br>unfortunately again our education and<br>mental health systems are just not set<br>up to adequately support these children<br>and they do fall through the cracks like<br>my demo they get denied early help<br>because they don't meet obvious or<br>acceptable criteria because they don't<br>fit the boxes or they're generally<br>misdiagnosed children who've got<br>involvement in both care and protection<br>and youth Justice is known as known as<br>crossover kits Australian Church<br>research shows that 50 of crossover<br>children have neurodesabilities and<br>they're inadequately cared for by former<br>care and Justice processes they<br>unfortunately do end up on that<br>trajectory from care to prison Even in<br>our family situation being reasonably<br>competent parents we ask for help early<br>and often yet we still got told our<br>child did not meet criteria for funded<br>support or specific intensive services<br>and because we could not get our child<br>diagnosed early enough we had to wait<br>for our child to be exploited and<br>victimized on the streets of Dunedin<br>first before we could get professionals<br>to seriously engage with us to support<br>him to be safe and well<br>in a report in 2020 our chief science<br>advisor for the Justice sector Professor<br>Ian lamby compiled compiled some of the<br>international local data around<br>prevalence of brain injuries including<br>those born with neurodeabilities as well<br>as those as those who acquired brain<br>injuries the staggeringly high rates of<br>justice involvements that these groups<br>had<br>in language tests 64 of New Zealand<br>youth Justice residents met the criteria<br>for communication impairments around<br>half those in New Zealand prisons had<br>dyslexia 83 percent of women in the<br>Christchurch prison had had multiple<br>traumatic brain injuries for autism<br>figures we don't really know but some<br>International and local evidence suggest<br>up to 15 percent of young people in<br>custody or who get sentenced to<br>imprisonment are autistic<br>for ADHD lamby tells us that up to<br>two-thirds of young people in detention<br>would screen for ADHD finally<br>intellectual disability which often<br>co-occurs with a range of other mental<br>health and other disabilities from one<br>international study by Hughes and<br>colleagues is suggested as being 23 to<br>32 for the Youth custody population<br>scary figures for fetal alcohol Spectrum<br>Disorder which is basically thought to<br>be two and a half times as prevalent as<br>autism in the general population it's<br>estimated to be three to five percent<br>um you know in similar populations but<br>in terms of Justice fasd one study shows<br>19 more times likely to be incarcerated<br>than people without fasd one<br>longitudinal study in the U.S showed 60<br>percent of those with FSD had had<br>trouble with the law and 35 percent had<br>been imprisoned at some point<br>International Studies report fasd rates<br>as ranging from 17 to 36 percent in<br>it's truly a hidden issue<br>fasd in our culture is a you know with a<br>frightening denial of the impact of our<br>drinking culture on future Generations<br>reiterated so by many many stakeholders<br>that I spoke to last year the definitive<br>youth Justice study internationally for<br>under 18 years is the banksia study in<br>the Youth Detention Center in Western<br>Australia where case as attainment<br>assessments were basically undertaken to<br>find out the prevalence rate of fasd and<br>other issues the data<br>again is worrying 89 of those young<br>people in the Detention Center had at<br>least one memory learning and daily<br>management impairment known as one at<br>least one severe brain domain impairment<br>also 65 percent of the incarcerated<br>young people had at least three areas of<br>neuro impairment including impairments<br>in memory executive functioning and<br>attention about a quarter of them would<br>have met the criteria for intellectual<br>disability to get a diagnosis for fasd<br>or even autism impairments have to be<br>significant when compared to what's<br>expected in a normal population a group<br>of researchers here in arteroa we're<br>still waiting on potential funding to do<br>a banksia like prevalence study in New<br>Zealand<br>who's in our youth justice system well<br>in the banksia youth detention study 99<br>young people were there at the time<br>and basically most of those neural<br>disabilities had never previously been<br>diagnosed<br>of the young people 74 were Aboriginal<br>youth 93 were male<br>um aged between 13 and 17 and not<br>surprisingly<br>unlike my pre like my previous slide<br>these young people had suffered many<br>adverse childhood experiences including<br>social deprivation poverty trauma<br>neglect out of Home Care early School<br>failure intergenerational trauma and<br>racialized practices practices of<br>discrimination<br>but do we have some of the children and<br>youth in our youth justice system and in<br>our lock residences well yes we do<br>currently give or take a um a slight<br>increase in Ram Raiders in the last few<br>weeks we have on average<br>um 100 use on a given day most are males<br>maybe 10 to 12 are females about 70<br>percent are on remand I suspect that's<br>gone up because as I've said in the last<br>couple of weeks unfortunately a lot of<br>Youth have been remanded and currently<br>the residences<br>are full<br>um so 30 might be on various sentences<br>but about 70 percent are Maori<br>most of these young people are 14 to 18<br>with a few under 14. New Zealand<br>research tells us that most kids in<br>trouble don't actually get to the stage<br>where they're in a residence or even go<br>to court we do try to divert via formal<br>warnings or other actions which avoid<br>them getting a criminal record but when<br>children particularly the the vulnerable<br>high and complex needs kids fail to<br>complete some of the quite demanding<br>plans they can end up in court or if<br>they keep reoffending or if their<br>offending is deemed serious they will<br>end up in court and about three-quarters<br>of those people young people in our<br>youth justice system could be described<br>as those crossover kids because they're<br>known to our care and protection<br>services and they have known suffered<br>abuse or neglect they have known<br>systemic adversities they're very<br>vulnerable youth with high and complex<br>needs these children you know are<br>already on that care to prison pipeline<br>when their parents or caregivers make<br>calls to police or social workers asking<br>for help Unfortunately they really run<br>the risk of losing their system to a<br>surveillance system that creates<br>Pathways for more harm than good of<br>course we've heard all this through our<br>own Royal Commission<br>our own Royal Commission of inquiry of<br>abuse and Care currently running until<br>2023 is littered with personal accounts<br>of this criminalization process and<br>sadly for some children this pipeline<br>so I think from what I've already said<br>you're beginning to get a picture of our<br>justice system our youth Justice systems<br>and our adult ones of course being full<br>of people with neural disabilities and<br>massive issues but why do they end up<br>incarcerated why aren't we identifying<br>them early and keeping them out of our<br>jails<br>fundamentally in our society we<br>criminalize behavior that does not fit<br>our systemic ableist and racist and<br>classist practices our intolerance of<br>those who are different from a young age<br>and our punitive responses<br>sadly off can be in the name of caring<br>sometimes means that we we fail these<br>children early on their neurodivergence<br>and genuine vulnerabilities because of<br>adverse childhood experiences and the<br>systemic ableism they face mean that<br>what are some of the primary issues well<br>issues to do with that exactly a<br>function in problems solving challenges<br>problems understanding cause and effect<br>reasoning capacity can be compromised<br>delays in learning or just a different<br>learning style but learning from<br>mistakes can be compromised<br>people talk about this term dismaturity<br>somebody appearing to be a much younger<br>age than their actual chronological age<br>there can be rigid and concrete thinking<br>there can be the term called<br>perseveration where people just got to<br>get stuck in a glitch and just keep<br>going keep going and cannot necessarily<br>weigh up the consequences of actions or<br>the pros and cons of different routes of<br>actions so the problems with planning<br>completion of tasks sometimes regulating<br>and controlling behavior and decision<br>making in tricky situations that can be<br>severely compromised at times the<br>impulsivity obviously particularly with<br>the cohort of ADHD but there's a lot of<br>issues around impulsivity attention and<br>concentration issues<br>um you know the no stop button that's a<br>term for a lot of parents in my studies<br>would use massively high energy levels<br>struggling at times with attentiveness<br>and so forth having sensory issues<br>meltdowns are severe quite severe panic<br>attacks often when a person who has a<br>neurodivergent condition is is you know<br>know overwhelmed with triggers around<br>them sensory triggers and other triggers<br>but it's fear and anxiety basis but<br>unfortunately a lot of young people who<br>have these kinds of meltdowns get<br>arrested for this year's issue time and<br>time again because police and others are<br>not trained to recognize those meltdowns<br>as a sign of distress and the person has<br>little control over their brain or<br>behavior at this point<br>people who are neurodivergent can be<br>hyper or hyposensitive to all sorts of<br>noises sights sounds and a range of<br>other sensory stimuli to a far greater<br>degree than neurotypical people<br>um and so people with sensory processes<br>processing issues might actively seek<br>risky sensory experiences or withdraw in<br>addition to becoming aggressive and<br>distressed<br>someone with fasd or other<br>neurodivergent conditions might have a<br>poor working memory so they they take<br>longer to process information they might<br>have difficulties with abstraction and<br>generalizing information therefore<br>potentially challenges to follow rules<br>or instructions they might have<br>communication difficulties we talk about<br>confabulation where people sort of are<br>filling in the gaps and they're eager to<br>please so potentially they make stuff up<br>just to you know make a situation change<br>well they might exaggerate or they might<br>just love telling stories but that can<br>get them into an awful lot of trouble we<br>talk about poor adaptive and social and<br>life skills adaptive functioning<br>challenges which are significant in<br>those with FSD and other neural<br>disabilities it can affect all stages of<br>their childhood and through the life<br>course to adulthood<br>people don't just sort of grow up out of<br>these issues that it's it's part of who<br>they are and it's part of the long-term<br>lifelong disability so adaptive<br>challenges whatever that might be can be<br>dressing showering feeding oneself<br>keeping to a timetable maintaining<br>attenders at school managing money<br>finding and keeping accommodation and<br>many other daily tasks that in a sense<br>those of us with neurotypicality might<br>take for granted<br>but it's the secondary issues where we<br>start to see the disabling and<br>criminalizing aspects<br>Trouble Comes when an intolerant Society<br>if you like responds negatively to some<br>of these primary issues that children<br>and youth experience<br>so they become incredibly vulnerable to<br>being a victim to being exploited to<br>being peer influenced because they can't<br>read the risky situations they become<br>vulnerable to being sexually exploited<br>and to generally being assaulted and<br>having their personal belongings stolen<br>to people you know becoming people<br>pleasing others take advantage of them<br>very easily potentially they get into<br>trouble with the law and and then over<br>time they become more and more harshly<br>treated because of struggling to learn<br>or follow instructions or keep<br>appointments or keep to their bail or<br>Court conditions they become easily<br>criminalized unfortunately it's all<br>connected back to a lot of these primary<br>issues as well as that systemic ableism<br>they have what we call suggestibility in<br>terms of communication because<br>um you know they can make false<br>confessions<br>um and unfortunately that leads to false<br>convictions because there's I mean even<br>neurotypical people with good<br>communication skills will struggle<br>comprehending legal Concepts or giving<br>statements and understanding the process<br>of doing that are children and youth<br>with neural disabilities are going to<br>find that much harder keeping safe is a<br>all recognizing risky situations is<br>another challenge also you know<br>self-harm getting um you know having<br>more accidents getting into debt early<br>death all of these are the secondary<br>impacts for some of these young people<br>suicide attempts um are much higher poor<br>mental health is much higher they'll<br>lose education they'll leave education<br>early or they get excluded early because<br>again they're not accommodated<br>sufficiently which will have a knock-on<br>effect on chances of getting<br>um you know legitimately good employee<br>limit as they age<br>substance issues some studies show up to<br>30 percent of those with fhd in<br>particular have significant issues with<br>substance misuse then there's<br>unfortunately the potential for<br>homelessness and so on there's a growing<br>literature<br>on the intersections of justice and<br>neurodesabilities including in New<br>Zealand and Australia Williams and<br>colleagues and in their book on<br>decolonization decolonizing Justice for<br>Aboriginal youth with fasd note that<br>specific Justice challenges include the<br>Assumption of Free Will and individual<br>rational choice to offend so it's<br>assuming that everybody's making<br>proactive choices all of the time and<br>that they've reasoned that you know<br>offending is the best option for them<br>when really for those with a range of<br>neurodivergent conditions they've been<br>born with these lifelong neurodivergent<br>conditions a lot of who they are will<br>not change the youth justice system<br>sadly um it just is it strives to fix<br>it's just got to fix it mentality it's<br>trying to fix things that may not change<br>some things might but unfortunately by<br>not recognizing neurodivergent<br>conditions or neurodiversity generally<br>it will not necessarily fix what it<br>can't be fixed so the lack of<br>neurodesability specific knowledge<br>skills and experiences of Frontline<br>workers often in Justice police lawyers<br>judges social workers psychologists<br>psychiatrists and lots of people on the<br>edges of Justice simply means that kids<br>with newer disabilities miss out and can<br>be harmed<br>I've met a few professionals who stand<br>out as obviously expert and that<br>knowledge is growing there's no doubt<br>but unfortunately many who can be<br>ignorant sometimes disinterested and<br>sometimes completely dismissive of the<br>reality of the impact of ableism and<br>systemic rejection of Children and Youth<br>when introduced with known disabilities<br>the reality is that those living with<br>fasd are vulnerable to providing<br>unreliable and inaccurate information<br>when being interviewed by police and<br>other legal professionals so it's vital<br>that they get communication assistance<br>and nominated person support even if<br>they're adults whether defendants or<br>Witnesses I've had the benefit of seeing<br>communication assistants first hand at<br>court and other legal processes and it<br>makes a huge difference to enabling<br>participation and voice not just for the<br>young person but it actually helps the<br>professionals around the young person<br>so newer disabilities and the rim packed<br>on sentencing can be problematic because<br>having a neurodesability can be used as<br>a mitigating Factor but unfortunately it<br>can also be used as an aggravating<br>Factor the assumption that a person of<br>course won't change they'll Break The<br>Rules all the time so why give them<br>early release you know there's some<br>issues around trying to accommodate take<br>it into consideration yet at the same<br>time actually use it against a young<br>person<br>so ideally and in accordance with the UN<br>General comment those with fasd and<br>other neurodivergent conditions in the<br>child justice system<br>especially should be diverted and not<br>criminalized the UN General comment on<br>the rights of children with neural<br>disabilities States<br>children with developmental delays or<br>neurodevelopmental disorders or<br>disabilities should not be in the child<br>justice system at all even if they've<br>reached the minimum age of criminal<br>responsibility<br>if not automatically excluded such<br>children should be individually assessed<br>so we've got some really good<br>rights-based approaches to<br>dealing with children but do we actually<br>operate those<br>on sentencing we've actually had some<br>excellent judgments by youth court and<br>District Court just judges about the<br>need to take into account the disability<br>rights of those with nearer disabilities<br>for example New Zealand Police versus<br>Morrison in 2019<br>judge Bill Hastings noted defendants<br>with fasd present challenges for every<br>participant in the criminal justice<br>process a more holistic wrap-around<br>approach that involves Health and Social<br>interventions is required to reduce the<br>risk of Criminal Justice involvement<br>judge Hastings also noted that failure<br>to take fasd into account at all stages<br>of the criminal justice system does not<br>achieve Justice for the person with fasd<br>or for the general community<br>judge Hastings focus in his judgment for<br>Thomas Morrison was to get him the<br>disability assessment and supports that<br>he needed before it was too late<br>but sadly these never came and Thomas<br>spent more time in jail and died of an<br>accidental overdose in September 2021<br>age 42. he's a subject I've put it up<br>here of an important documentary on fasd<br>that I'd encourage all of you to read<br>see aired in March 2022<br>another judge his honor judge Tony<br>Fitzgerald who is currently New<br>Zealand's most knowledgeable judge on<br>fasd also advocates for the<br>implementation of U.N rights in court to<br>uphold the best interest of those with<br>nearer disabilities and to use the least<br>restrictive options to deal with those<br>who are young and getting into trouble<br>some of his judgments note that too many<br>young people are remanded in youth<br>Justice residences I.E the lockups<br>because no adequate supported<br>accommodation can be found to enable<br>bail in the community all that care and<br>protection services are failing to help<br>these young people avoid the justice<br>system we do hear this time and time<br>again from parents and caregivers and<br>other researchers in New Zealand have<br>been discovering this that everyone kind<br>of Waits For Justice to provide the<br>resources rather than actually deal with<br>issues before it ends up in court<br>while there are clearly many issues with<br>Children and Youth who are<br>neurodivergent being primed for trouble<br>let's not forget that often these same<br>children have strengths and can<br>contribute massively to how we can view<br>the world of neurodiversity my recent<br>research with caregivers and<br>stakeholders talked of Silver Linings<br>becoming better people more tolerant<br>more appreciative of the small successes<br>and how their newer Divergent adds so<br>much to their lives<br>Children and Youth with neurodivergent<br>conditions often have excellent<br>expressive language they can be funny<br>engaging and sociable they often live in<br>the moment and don't hold grudges<br>they're often honest forgiving artistic<br>sporty loving and generous with<br>long-term stable homes and enough funded<br>supports from a young age those living<br>with nearer disabilities can actually<br>live well<br>so many participants in my recent<br>research noted it's vital that children<br>feel comfortable in the environment<br>they're living in and vital that they<br>live the best lives that they can do in<br>the circumstances which are often not<br>easy Once accepted valued and supported<br>those with newer disabilities can live a<br>good life they've got a right to a good<br>life yet our current systems of care and<br>protection all youth Justice education<br>and mental health don't always allow<br>that to happen<br>one of the issues I found is that<br>children and youth when you're a<br>disabilities get stuck in the youth<br>justice system before they end up in<br>adult systems there's a range of reasons<br>why this happens and how this happens an<br>actual reoffending is only one factor<br>the failure to screen and diagnose early<br>means that children who are<br>neurodivergent will not have their needs<br>met including getting accommodations at<br>school all the extra support they might<br>need to participate fairly and equally<br>in all manner of activities and support<br>services<br>when they have meltdowns and damaged<br>property at school at home or elsewhere<br>they easily come to the attention of the<br>police early<br>or if they are easily persuaded to join<br>others in Risky and illegal activity it<br>doesn't take long before they get<br>arrested often their judgment is such<br>that they can't tell safe people from<br>dangerous people and they're easily<br>exploited and trained to participate in<br>minor offending like shoplifting or<br>selling their medications before long<br>they become well known to child welfare<br>and Justice Services once they slip into<br>Justice processes processes and if they<br>remain unassessed for their disabilities<br>then the rules and conditions of bail<br>might prove particularly challenging<br>if the key player is Injustice police<br>social workers Bell support workers<br>lawyers and judges are not trained or<br>competent in neuro-informed practices<br>and if neuro-informed services are not<br>available the young person could easily<br>become labeled as a reasoning deviant<br>very much you know somebody who seemed<br>to be at risk of causing further Mayhem<br>if they don't stop offending and it<br>tends to be blamed the individual<br>alongside some of their parents the<br>experience for the young person<br>obviously can become negative very<br>quickly especially if there's no<br>diagnosis but sometimes even if they<br>have a diagnosis and there's no wrap<br>around services to provider to support<br>them<br>even when disability services are called<br>into support sometimes in offering<br>supported bail they themselves sometimes<br>could unwittingly escalate a child being<br>denied future bail this is because of<br>intensive surveillance surveillance<br>practices that youth can be under in<br>some placements I've seen examples of<br>when disability support notes are<br>provided to Justice professionals when a<br>youth breaks even the smallest of rules<br>and these notes get referred to or even<br>attached to court reports and these<br>notes are highly subjective just an<br>opinion really and they've no legal<br>standing but they then come to court and<br>they get used to deprive children of<br>bail and their Liberty these notes are<br>often completed by workers with little<br>training in how to work with<br>neurodivergent people or traumatized<br>youth when help is offered it is usually<br>only supplied once a child has been<br>arrested and charged not before even<br>when families have usually been asking<br>for help well before it's offered at the<br>cliff and sadly not the prevention end<br>my research plus research from Australia<br>suggests that if children were fully<br>supported to stay at home with their<br>families they would have less risk of<br>being fast-tracked to more serious<br>court-based options<br>Social Work justice system which is<br>designed to uphold the best interest and<br>Welfare of our children often<br>unfortunately does the opposite in the<br>name of caring under our neoliberal<br>Contracting culture<br>um orangutan mariki engages in contracts<br>with services and ngos potentially that<br>exclude input from whanau and provide<br>support services to two children that<br>are supposedly in their best interest<br>but they haven't involved the people who<br>know the child the best<br>then staff who are often poorly paid and<br>often not trained in working with those<br>who have neural disabilities are asked<br>to care for some of the most complex<br>children we have in RC Aurora and this<br>unfortunately can lead to children being<br>punished for minor rural infractions the<br>children are often expected to behave<br>more perfectly than neurotypical<br>children it really is asking too much of<br>them the same happens in some OT run<br>residences where being abusive and<br>threatening like a lot of teens can be<br>can get you charged with multiple new<br>offenses punishable by solitary<br>confinement and loss of early release<br>just like adult imprisonment in the<br>wrong place common teenage Behavior can<br>become overly punished and criminalized<br>new disabled children get stuck in<br>Justice because they're easily targeted<br>they struggle with all of those<br>executive functioning impairments and<br>they don't learn in the same way or at<br>the same Pace as neurotypical youth yet<br>these differences are punished they need<br>less expectations placed upon them to<br>keep to the conditions post on them<br>they need extra help and support to keep<br>to the plans they don't always get this<br>help I've seen plans and conditions that<br>are up to 10 pages long and written in<br>such a way that most adults wouldn't<br>understand them often these plans go on<br>for more than six to 12 months and the<br>youth just can't keep to the extensive<br>demands for that long<br>when they breach these plants then they<br>start all over again with a new<br>appearance in court further charges and<br>new court orders sometimes they get<br>punished over and over again for the<br>same original offenses as well as any<br>new breaches or of conditions or the<br>general rule breaking of the rules<br>that's why they never seem to get off<br>bail or youth court orders and they stay<br>for a long time in the youth justice<br>system the young people get stuck<br>because they're not being diverted early<br>enough from the Machinery of Justice<br>Children and Youth with neural<br>disabilities are the wrong fit for<br>justice yet few other options are<br>provided in the name of welfare too many<br>expectations to conform and be grateful<br>for services are applied most Justice<br>practice is firmly based in a reasoning<br>Choice making criminal and a<br>risk-obsessed model of Team Behavior<br>which is so far from the reality of much<br>teen impulsivity and dismaturity those<br>of you are parents of teens will<br>there are so many costs to criminalizing<br>the hundreds maybe thousands of children<br>in youth in RTO Row in New Zealand the<br>obvious Financial costs run into<br>millions don't they just keeping one<br>child for 12 months in a lock-up will<br>cost 267<br>000 annually<br>imagine all the costs associated with<br>this<br>young person arrest processing going to<br>court family group conferences lawyers<br>communication assistants mentors help<br>from ngos specialist education forensic<br>professionals report writers developing<br>and implementing plans the Machinery of<br>justice is huge and expensive and could<br>these millions be better used in other<br>ways on Alternatives I mean one child<br>can cost half a million per year but in<br>my own research many caregivers have<br>told me that if only a fraction of that<br>money was used to provide respite and<br>in-home or in-school supports for their<br>child and their family<br>everyone might have suffered a whole lot<br>less everyone and the child could have<br>stayed at home for longer<br>in 2018 a report regarding pregnancy<br>warning labels on packaged alcoholic<br>beverages noted the annual cost of new<br>fasd cases would incur costs of at least<br>171 million applying a conservative<br>conservative three percent prevalence<br>rate<br>Eastern and colleagues in New Zealand in<br>another study estimated an annual loss<br>productivity of due due to fasd to be<br>anywhere between 49 million and 200<br>million<br>uh and of course we're not just talking<br>about financial savings are we<br>sadly other costs more significantly<br>early death<br>several of these people are very<br>familiar one study shows that those<br>living with FSD on average die in their<br>mid-30s due to high risk taking poor<br>mental health increased suicide attempts<br>and other self-harming increased risk of<br>homelessness and spells in prison all of<br>these are massive we know that tainapura<br>lost 21 years of Liberty for his now<br>known wrongful conviction<br>moha Fawcett spent five years in prison<br>for a murder he did not commit before<br>his convictions were overturned Tamaki<br>hekke lost his life by Suicide primarily<br>because of the years of inappropriate or<br>no services to meet his needs and Thomas<br>Morrison whom I mentioned before<br>these names are mostly Maori but this<br>issue is not a Maori issue specifically<br>although Judas processes of settler<br>colonialism inevitably the impacts of<br>alcohol harm disproportionately impact<br>Maori compared to other groups<br>the cost of wrongful convictions due to<br>not having or a missed diagnosis<br>alongside false confessions at the hands<br>of police interviewing and legal<br>processes that were not neurodesability<br>informed are obvious years of life<br>wasted behind bars so many losses also<br>the mental health impacts are huge with<br>high rates of anxiety and depression one<br>study showed over three quarters of one<br>group with fasd being on medications to<br>reduce stress distress symptoms and<br>sleep issues my own qualitative studies<br>on FSD show massive impacts on stress<br>and well-being of whanau who care for<br>their loved children with newer<br>disabilities the cost to family members<br>over the life course are mostly hidden<br>and significant across social emotional<br>spiritual and financial and relationship<br>domains not many families get funded<br>disability supports they can if a child<br>has a coexisting intellectual disability<br>or other funded disability we need<br>funding streams based on functioning and<br>not diagnosis<br>what is it a child can actually do how<br>can we help them achieve their good life<br>what do they need to be on a fair<br>playing field to participate and<br>flourish<br>I want to make briefly special mention<br>of the impacts of our young people who<br>get placed in youth Justice residences<br>these places are not places of safety<br>and they remain violent<br>in every respect I wrote in a media<br>piece recently of specific oppressive<br>practices in these places and other<br>media articles and statements from the<br>Children's Commission have talked of the<br>violence in these residences daily<br>bullying and assaults occur daily harm<br>and worst of all the overuse of physical<br>restraint and psychological torture<br>occurs through extensive and unjustified<br>use of solitary confinement for often up<br>to six days at a time<br>residences don't have enough medical<br>practitioners all psychologists or<br>occupational therapists to offer therapy<br>the education provided can be piecemeal<br>the promise of therapeutic interventions<br>is false with staff fully stretched and<br>unable to provide the in-depth care the<br>children need even if they want to the<br>residence is bar one operate a rewards<br>and Punishment system known as the<br>Behavioral Management System this model<br>has been based on outdated social<br>learning psychology for those with<br>lifelong newer disabilities and has been<br>used punitively to make kids conform<br>with no accommodations for those who<br>struggle more it's a one-size-fits-all<br>and children with neurodesabilities have<br>to work much much harder to get the<br>rewards they often don't get to reward<br>level three which means they have less<br>call time with whanau they can't do<br>certain activities they get less music<br>listening privileges and they are<br>deprived of any chance of day release<br>activities<br>while the staff working in youth Justice<br>residences will be genuine and kind<br>people they are still not mostly newer<br>disability informed or trauma informed<br>trained youth Justice residents are<br>simply the wrong environment for<br>Children and Youth for neurodesabilities<br>the former children's commissioner<br>Andrew beekoff has said we should<br>bulldoze them I'd be very happy if that<br>happened the use of Youth Justice<br>residence is instead of other<br>community-based provision to promote<br>well-being or reduce reoffending is<br>virtually pointless because we know that<br>punishment and deprivation of Liberty<br>doesn't work the stats tell us that the<br>reoffending rate is 88 for young people<br>exiting youth Justice residences within<br>12 months of release<br>children are released back into the same<br>environments they left after long spells<br>of 24 7 control and they're not provided<br>with wraparound bespoke disability<br>supports often it's piece Mill and time<br>limited and transition from care<br>Provisions are woefully inadequate or<br>non-existent<br>in this final section I want to reflect<br>on how we can do things better how can<br>we help those currently stuck Injustice<br>processes how can we avoid them getting<br>stuck in the first place and even better<br>what you know what might a good life<br>look like for those living with newer<br>disabilities who might be at risk of<br>criminalization<br>firstly a quote from a disability<br>Advocate who participated in my own<br>Recent research<br>on living well with fasd well-being<br>means a person with fasd is able to<br>realize all the potential that they've<br>ever had being appreciated as<br>neurodivergent as Quirky as special or<br>different<br>simply being appreciated and not judged<br>or stigmatized or harmed or refused<br>services and supports someone with fasd<br>who has well-being is allowed to live<br>their life in the way they want to<br>obviously we don't want them to harm<br>others or to be harmed so we need<br>mechanisms in place by which we<br>accommodate and build those ramps so<br>that the person with fasd flourishes and<br>others enjoy being with them and that<br>we're all learning from one another and<br>we are at ease with one another<br>so much of that quote tells us a good<br>life is possible yet with thousands of<br>neurodivergent Youth with complex needs<br>we just don't make that happen and we<br>harm them<br>clearly adverse childhood experiences<br>poverty the impacts of colonization<br>alongside various disabilities like FSD<br>autism ADHD and other neurodivergent<br>conditions mean that some children and<br>youth are more vulnerable to<br>criminalization processes<br>fundamentally we need to avoid<br>criminalization of neural disabilities<br>and offer those with neurode<br>so it's important to screen those with<br>neural disabilities as early as possible<br>when parents or others identify the need<br>we don't yet have some of these<br>disabilities acknowledged as in need of<br>disability services support funding I.E<br>FSD in particular and this leads to many<br>children being denied basic additional<br>help with early interventions especially<br>at school<br>there have been some moves to be more<br>inclusive but my own interviews with<br>over 90 professionals recently tells me<br>that education still does not have the<br>resources to provide the significant<br>teacher Aid support or extra<br>accommodations in the classroom and so<br>often children who become criminalized<br>of course leave school early or they get<br>excluded early pretty much all of my<br>research participants describe major<br>issues with schooling and education<br>when children do come to the attention<br>of mental health other health Justice<br>and care and protection services we need<br>disability Specialists both within and<br>alongside those services so that the<br>at-risk children get funneled into<br>primarily a bespoke disability system<br>keeping the young person at home with<br>wraparound supports to cater for trauma<br>mental health education and disability<br>needs is vital we need our workers to be<br>trained in understanding and working<br>with neurodivergent individuals I'm<br>lucky this year that I've launched<br>otago's first University level course<br>for those Keen to study and train more<br>in this area we do need social workers<br>lawyers judges police doctors<br>psychologists Allied health<br>professionals mental health<br>professionals occupational therapists<br>all Justice workers speech and language<br>Specialists teachers we need everyone to<br>undertake education and skills<br>development in this area we need a shift<br>in institutional coaches to prioritize<br>well-being rather than compliance and<br>risk factors<br>Injustice specifically there are a range<br>of options that can happen our age of<br>criminal responsibility could be raised<br>to at least 16 maybe higher rather than<br>the 10 it currently is it would be<br>better to have help from every other<br>service and not Justice until every<br>other service has been exhausted<br>so the higher the age the more chance of<br>other services I.E not just as being<br>developed and involved we have known<br>Health Service and NGO workers basically<br>tell us that orangutamariki can only<br>orangutan where he can help<br>and OT then is left as the service that<br>picks up the pieces when other services<br>fail that's not fair on OT and then<br>within OT the care and protection<br>workers tell us the only help that is<br>coming is coming from Justice so by<br>implication everyone Waits until the<br>offending all victimization happens<br>we could develop a new service for 18 to<br>25 year olds that caters for brain<br>development maturation and should be<br>based on our youth Justice processes<br>that take account of the drivers of<br>offending and offer restorative options<br>but also robust plans of support to help<br>young people get out of the Justice<br>machine<br>our chief science advisor Ian lamby and<br>many many others have produced excellent<br>reports in this regard with detailed<br>recommendations and our chief justices<br>want to see more specialized Courts for<br>those with nearer disabilities and<br>complex needs we have a few but we need<br>more<br>other specific supports well<br>we could use police diversion and<br>Alternatives more go to court list<br>obviously and when it court and fgc<br>always provide communication assistance<br>use the least restrictive sentences as<br>well as apply the UN disability rights<br>model<br>ensure use in trouble are automatically<br>assessed for neurode disabilities<br>if the rates are so high and get<br>reassessed as well if there's been say<br>more than a four-year Gap since the last<br>assessment<br>place a young person in a remand home<br>that mirrors a decent family atmosphere<br>rather than a youth Justice residence if<br>bail is denied don't punish them for<br>breaking rules that lead to further<br>charges they can be if they run away<br>from a romantic they can be charged with<br>the new criminal offense of escaping<br>custody that can escalate them to prison<br>obviously I'm a fan of closing youth<br>Justice residents completely and I<br>prefer to offer one-to-one secure<br>sentence Management in the community for<br>every person under 18. if they're deemed<br>in need of a secure placement so a home<br>with disability workers well-trained<br>security staff if need be maybe use<br>electronic monitoring this has got to be<br>better than what happens in residences<br>and if it's working maybe carry it on<br>Beyond 18 if it's possible<br>if it's working it's expensive but that<br>way<br>the kids avoid the institutionalized<br>violence from the residents experience<br>which has been shown over and over the<br>decades in terms of our abuse and Care<br>inquiries<br>that way all manner of harm and<br>peer-to-peer crime education and gang<br>recruitment might be reduced and as if a<br>person staying in the community their<br>supports and connections to culture and<br>family can remain<br>it's important to have multi-agency<br>teams around the child all young people<br>with appropriate funding to support<br>bespoke individualized interventions to<br>keep everyone safe and to develop<br>positive skills and identities for the<br>young person and their whana and<br>supporters we need to train and employ<br>specific fasd autism and ADHD Navigators<br>who coordinate and plan services and<br>supports and seek funding to help young<br>people<br>we need to listen carefully to young<br>people and their whana as to what they<br>think they will work go with their<br>suggestions first until proven wrong<br>Carell and Chapman a couple of UK<br>researchers proposed the need for all of<br>us to develop what they term<br>neurotypical humility<br>which includes moving away from those<br>deficit views of neural differences<br>embracing a neurodiversity paradigm<br>which focuses on the rights strengths<br>and flourishing capacities of newer<br>Divergent people<br>the recognition that those living with<br>neural disabilities are not doomed to<br>lower well-being and recognition that<br>they're thriving can look very different<br>I asked some of my highly neuro-informed<br>friends<br>what neurotypical humility looked like<br>they emphasize person-centered practice<br>listening to families listening to youth<br>as experts showing compassion stop<br>trying to fix people being educated and<br>understanding of how the brain works and<br>the behaviors that show are often a sign<br>of brain injury and diversity it's not<br>about Badness<br>that neurotypical people are not<br>Superior to neurodivergent people<br>we all have to deal with our ableism<br>because put simply those born with<br>neurodivergent conditions and most of<br>those acquiring brain injuries did not<br>choose Pathways of exclusion offending<br>or victimization<br>they warrant our protection and support<br>across all systems in society but<br>especially our youth justice system<br>thank you so much for listening<br>um<br>so welcome to all of you this evening I<br>am the pro Vice Chancellor of the<br>division of humanities here at otago and<br>it's my great pleasure to provide the<br>Anita and I had the chance to get to<br>know each other at better<br>um<br>five five six years ago when we both<br>enrolled in night classes to learn at<br>the local wananga out in South Dunedin<br>and so we were there every Tuesday night<br>for a year and we had several weekend<br>and it was a wonderful experience I<br>think for both of us for different<br>reasons but for similar reasons and I<br>and I having read I got to read Anita's<br>lecture before the rest of you all got<br>to hear it lucky me but in reading that<br>and reflecting on that relationship I've<br>had with Anita and our learning<br>experiences together it struck me that<br>there are some similarities between that<br>experience of learning today Maori and<br>seeing the great strengths in her<br>research that came through tonight so<br>that experience of learning Talia was<br>both incredibly challenging and<br>immensely hopeful for both of us as we<br>increased<br>slowly in our competence of today and<br>also as our world view expanded to learn<br>more of tiao Maori and of the tongue<br>that it is to all of those who<br>acknowledge and respect its place in New<br>Zealand aotearoa today and I I think<br>Anita's research does the same thing<br>and I think first of all I wanted to<br>point out that that challenge which is<br>obvious to all of us her research casts<br>light on the challenges experienced by<br>neurodiverse children and youth yes<br>but more than that her research directly<br>challenges us as a society as to what<br>we're going to do about it<br>and that's an incredibly powerful<br>challenge Anita and I want to thank you<br>for that I am<br>had a look at or pulled out the research<br>impact framework today<br>just a wee bit of University bureaucracy<br>yeah she's looking ahead of us how does<br>this relatives so um the ministry of<br>um<br>let me find it for you the ministry of<br>business Innovation and employment who<br>is the government's<br>um doing lots of things including the<br>funding of research here in New Zealand<br>by universities and they have over<br>recent years become more and more<br>committed to this belief that research<br>has to have impact<br>and for many of us here in universities<br>we both<br>welcome back but also you know roll our<br>eyes we've been doing impact forever we<br>don't need<br>um you know we don't need politicians to<br>tell us what that is but it struck me in<br>Reading Anita's lecture I went back and<br>had a look at the definition of research<br>impact and it's this<br>the research goes beyond contribution to<br>Knowledge and Skills in research<br>organizations<br>and changes the economy the society or<br>the environment around us<br>yeah see the connection I think that's<br>exactly what Anita's research is doing<br>it is challenging us to figure out and<br>to consider how we change the society<br>around us to make it a better place for<br>those members of our society who are<br>neurodiverse<br>secondly I think her research has within<br>it an incredible message of Hope<br>what could our society what could our<br>place look like if we better understood<br>the needs of those members of our<br>community who are neurodiverse<br>what if our communities embraced these<br>children and young adults what if our<br>communities enabled them to live in who<br>they are rather than constantly trying<br>to fix them and getting it so terribly<br>wrong<br>and today again just another little<br>story that for me fits so well into this<br>evening's lecture I happened upon a<br>story on the stuff website and the title<br>of the story was<br>groovy Kermit and his sobering mission<br>to make you smile<br>what is she talking about now and it was<br>a picture of a young man he's 23 sitting<br>on top of his bright green car<br>his name is David McNamara and he lives<br>in New Plymouth<br>and he drives his green car around on<br>Saturday and Sunday nights probably<br>Friday nights too offering a free sober<br>driver service to anyone who needs it<br>and if they feel so obliged they can<br>return with a koha a gift of payment to<br>him and it was a lovely story but<br>interestingly have a listen to this bit<br>of it<br>I should also say he also loves drum and<br>bass music so his car is known around<br>town for very loudly emitting drum and<br>bass music<br>for McNamara his penchant for drum and<br>bass proved to be a good fit with his<br>ADHD diagnosis<br>I need music which can keep me going and<br>keep me motivated getting out of the<br>house and on the road was also part of a<br>wider message that McNamara wanted to<br>spread about self-acceptance he said as<br>groovy Kermit the name he's given<br>himself he was just being myself and he<br>hoped it would Inspire others to do the<br>same<br>McNamara's experience of seeing his<br>mother cope with his father's death when<br>he was quite young his father died in a<br>car crash in witnessing the sacrifices<br>she made to raise him had been a major<br>influence on him too<br>and the type the article ends with a<br>quote from McNamara<br>she's a giver<br>and I thought well you know what David<br>so are you and how blessed you are to<br>have found a community that allows you<br>to give back<br>and that for me is just a beautiful<br>example of what Anita's research is<br>about how do we as a community community<br>recognize the needs of those around us<br>and allow them to give back to us so<br>Bravo Anita you are doing wonderful<br>research<br>academics are normally very passionate<br>about their field of expertise and their<br>families might say unbearably passionate<br>and for many of us it is more than just<br>an intellectual interest<br>and I think that is absolutely true<br>of Anita Anita's academic career is her<br>vocation to discover the truth and<br>cooperation with others and to develop<br>solutions that do justice that cultivate<br>the good and that restore manner to<br>Children and Youth and in so doing to<br>restore that to all of us<br>we are really proud to call you a<br>Anita Gibbs<br>it's my pleasure now to present Anita<br>with a wee gift or a token of this<br>evening's proceedings<br>and congratulate you once more for your<br>promotion<br>Emma so the audience for those of you<br>who were lucky enough to be here with us<br>in person thank you so much for coming<br>out and for those of you who've joined<br>us online either now live or later we<br>forgive
