faculty of science John<br>hosking to introduce and host niola<br>Gaston at her inaugural professorial<br>lecture I'm the deputy Dean in that<br>faculty and I think part of the pleasure<br>in introducing Nica in this talk is that<br>NCA is an outstanding champion of<br>Science and not a constricted narrow<br>form of science but a form of science<br>that is inclusive and diverse<br>understanding of its context and<br>importantly understanding of all of the<br>uh components of equity that might go<br>into a flourishing science Society so I<br>just want to start by acknowledging that<br>acknowledging your service in that space<br>and thanking you for that Nicola is an<br>outstanding academic with an exceptional<br>track record across research teaching<br>and service she studied first at UA<br>completed her PhD at Massie University<br>and I know we have people from Massie<br>here today undertook a post-doctoral<br>fellowship at the max plank Institute<br>for the physics of complex systems in<br>Dresden Germany and then returned to New<br>Zealand to work at industrial res Arch<br>limited for six years and later at<br>University of Wellington and I think<br>that time at IRL really shaped some of<br>the skill set that you have been able to<br>bring to beer on your career uh you have<br>been director co-director of The mcdad<br>Institute for Advanced Materials and<br>nanotechnology which is a New Zealand<br>Center of research excellence and you've<br>been elected president of the New<br>Zealand Association of scientists 2002<br>2015 uh<br>amazing service to our community and to<br>science nicolar is a physicist and works<br>in the area of condensed matter<br>particularly utilizing many body<br>interactions between atoms to design<br>functional materials at the<br>nanoscale over the course of Nicholas's<br>career she's published more than 74<br>papers in one book that apparently she<br>hoped would date fast but it hasn't and<br>that book is why science is sexist uh<br>during her time with IRL Nicola was<br>strongly focused on industry engagement<br>and<br>commercialization and since becoming<br>codirector for The mcdad Institute she's<br>had and continues to have a significant<br>influence on public policy Nicola is one<br>of our most successful grant winners<br>securing almost $50 million for the<br>mcdad center of research Excellence<br>along with over 3 A5 million in personal<br>funding via more than 10 uh grants<br>she is a committed and exceptionally<br>capable teacher and has played a pivotal<br>role in shaping the curriculum in<br>physics she supervised more than 10 PhD<br>students to completion which is<br>exceptional considering the amount of<br>time she's actually had in the<br>University sector versus uh the research<br>institutional<br>sector and she's of course mentored and<br>I would say inspired many colleagues she<br>is an effective champion for Equitable<br>Education and Research with an<br>exceptional track record of leadership<br>at the Forefront of change in these<br>spaces it's my great pleasure to<br>acknowledge you Nicola on behalf of the<br>faculty of science for your<br>well-deserved promotion to professor and<br>to warmly welcome you to deliver what I<br>think based on the title is going to be<br>an address that I really like please<br>welcome<br>the<br>um is the sound coming through I'm<br>wearing two mics on account of the<br>recording so I'll just check that first<br>um and K J um I know you say you're here<br>on in in lie of John but uh I'm I'm<br>quite glad it was you and not him<br>um that was lovely and I have nothing<br>against John just just that was that was<br>lovely thank you um also it might be a<br>little bit in the theme of what I'm<br>talking about tonight and I think maybe<br>maybe you just delivered the perfect<br>introduction so thank you very<br>much um so a feminist Dairy of quantum<br>mechanics um what is this um oh it's a<br>it's a bit of Whimsy um it's a little<br>bit serious it's something that I've<br>been thinking about for a bit of well<br>most of my career if you if you want to<br>think about it that way um and so yeah I<br>guess one thing it's not uh I'm not<br>going to come in and tell you that<br>quantum mechanics is wrong we we use it<br>every day it's really useful and so<br>we'll just start with that but the fact<br>that it it might be different in a<br>different environment um in a different<br>context that we might think about it<br>differently if we think about being<br>feminists in our daily lives um well<br>that's maybe the the The Whimsy that I'm<br>going to share with with you um in<br>tonight's lecture so a couple of things<br>one I did a rat test before coming which<br>is why I took off my mask thank you for<br>everybody who is wearing a mask because<br>you know it's kind of it's not that<br>crowded the selector theater has been<br>worse but it's still quite a lot of<br>people in a smaller space so thank you<br>very<br>much<br>I struggle with what an inaugural<br>lecture is to be honest um it is<br>supposed to be the first lecture that<br>you give and by the time that you are<br>promoted to Professor you've given a few<br>lectures um and so I had a email<br>conversation with somebody a couple of<br>weeks ago and I sort of ended up saying<br>well it's it's kind of this weird<br>mixture between a a valid dictory but<br>I'm not really ready to retire yet and<br>something that's just really<br>self-indulgent and maybe I've gone well<br>with the self-indulgent I've tried to<br>make it more than that but we we'll see<br>how we get on um but one of the thing it<br>made me think of is actually my first<br>lecture my first first lecture um and I<br>don't mean the first lecture that I ever<br>gave but the first lecture that I ever<br>sat through at<br>University and the reason it made me<br>think of this is that I was in this<br>room at 8:00 on a Monday morning physics<br>first<br>year um first lecture I would ever have<br>gone to at<br>University and and yeah that was that's<br>kind of a weird realization in the<br>context of going the talk so I thought<br>it I'm G to give full credit to Richard<br>here um before I took a job as an<br>academic at the University of Oakland in<br>the physics department I had a chat to<br>Richard about what it was to be a<br>student B back in the day um and I told<br>him this story and he was like oh I went<br>full metal jacket on you and so that's<br>the what the photo um refers to and so I<br>was somewhere<br>around where kushler is sitting maybe<br>the row behind in the middle up there<br>and the lecturer was here on the front I<br>won't say who it<br>was um and they said well I'd like you<br>all to look to your left so everybody<br>can join me in this you look to your<br>left see the person sitting to your left<br>and then you now look to your right I'm<br>looking the wrong direction but the<br>miror image symmetry doesn't matter too<br>much um one of you will fail this<br>course so that was um yeah that was my<br>first lecture in this room and I have<br>had cause to think a little bit about<br>that philosophy of teaching such as it<br>is since um because a big part of being<br>a professor or an academic is teaching<br>um and so I want wanted to start with<br>reflection a few people in this room who<br>might follow me on Twitter have probably<br>seen this before I shared it a few years<br>ago the first year that I just moved to<br>Oakland and was teaching quantum<br>mechanics again in this lecture theater<br>so there's a little bit of a a string to<br>this<br>um and I had to go away and put some<br>multiple choice questions together for a<br>test and went to the the the the<br>standard resource which is a a question<br>Bank comes with the textbook and<br>scanning through it this is the Quantum<br>mechanic section I came came across this<br>is um it's not a pedagogically useful<br>question but it was a question and and<br>the question back in the textbook and um<br>none of these answers are correct by the<br>way and and if you don't know what n and<br>L are just really do not worry about<br>this the point is that it's really quite<br>weird to have something like this in<br>teaching material right and and we can<br>all laugh at it because it is a joke but<br>it's a joke not in the way that it was<br>intended to be a joke if that makes<br>sense right so thinking a little bit<br>about how we teach thinking a little bit<br>about who we are and what matters while<br>we do our jobs in Academia is something<br>that's important to me and I guess<br>from or in wiser words um sometimes you<br>roll your eyes and and sometimes that is<br>what feminism is that helps to just<br>point out the ridiculous and and point<br>out things that aren't quite you know<br>appropriate uh and so in put this talk<br>together I problem is I want to talk<br>about far too many things um it's a<br>problem I often have I'm doing my best<br>to to pull it all together into some<br>kind of coherent narrative I might lose<br>you at one point or another um but I'll<br>do my best so I guess the the<br>superpositions of things that I care<br>about that I want to talk about are a<br>little bit about feminism quite a lot<br>about physics that's kind of the point<br>um Academia a bit and Academia itself is<br>a superposition of lots of different<br>things that we do as academics we teach<br>we do research we do service work for<br>the community that's all part of the job<br>and balancing those things as I know<br>many people in this room have found is<br>tricky and so I was thinking a little<br>bit about what my starting point for<br>this talk is and and actually this is<br>very off topic but this little book by<br>Mami what I talk about when I talk about<br>running um I started I think I was<br>reading this when I was I was teaching<br>second year quantum mechanics a few<br>years ago and I I started thinking about<br>this idea of what I what I think about<br>when I teach quantum mechanics um what<br>do I yeah what do I think about when I<br>teach quantum mechanics that could have<br>been the title of this talk<br>iose um some people have seen me wearing<br>my rage against machine learning hoodie<br>recently I just wanted to point out that<br>there are other very good riffs on this<br>around there the place um Sarah armed<br>living a feminist life in the context of<br>being a physicist you know it's a it's<br>something you can take into any context<br>really um ghost stories for Darwin is<br>the one that probably gets most at the<br>the the relationship between being a um<br>a woman or or a minority person in some<br>sense in the context of science um and<br>that's also definitely been a bit of an<br>inspiration for this talk too so that's<br>just my citation list<br>um right so I promised a a little bit of<br>discussion about quantum mechanics and<br>so we're going to start with what I<br>think one should always start with um<br>which is the double slit experiment um<br>and we're going to keep this reasonably<br>simple we're not going to go technical<br>but I want to get a couple of key ideas<br>across so bear with me I'll I'll do my<br>best um so the double slit experiment is<br>something which is um is set up to show<br>that you've got a particle and it's<br>moving and you've got some sort of<br>screen with holes in it slits um and if<br>you've got a slit in the in a in your<br>screen presumably this particle can go<br>through that slit and land somewhere<br>where it is observed on some wall on the<br>on the far side of the<br>experiment and so if you have two slits<br>um we we observe some things about the<br>nature of particles that sort of sets up<br>the way that we think about quantum<br>mechanics so we might have a fundamental<br>particle an electron or a photon<br>something that behaves Quantum<br>mechanically it goes through it's<br>detected um and this little GIF is just<br>there to show you that it's detected as<br>a little point of impact as a<br>particle but there's a pattern up on the<br>screen and the pattern also is there to<br>tell you that something is creating that<br>pattern and that's the fact that these<br>particles are not just particles but<br>they have a WAV like<br>Behavior they are waves in some sense<br>and so this is my complimentary GIF um<br>trying to illustrate simply that idea<br>that when you have waves they can either<br>add constructively and become more than<br>what they were individually or they can<br>add<br>quantum mechanical<br>particles so this is sort of the setup<br>of this double slit<br>experiment and so the fact that you get<br>both the individual particles being<br>observed and these patterns which<br>indicate waves tells you really that you<br>have what's called wave particle duality<br>in physics and this is important it's<br>not the most important thing about this<br>experiment though because it was sort of<br>known beforehand that there are other<br>reasons to believe that um Quantum<br>particles can have both wav like and<br>particle-like<br>characteristics um but it's it's a<br>really clear demonstration of this<br>concept so a duality of of of identity I<br>suppose and so a pattern like this can<br>be<br>created um but the thing about the<br>pattern is that it was represents<br>something it represents more than just<br>the behavior of well actually I'm going<br>to dial back on that um you can think<br>about it I'll say as representing the<br>behavior of more than one particle but<br>so so it it gives you a um a a space in<br>which an observation might happen and it<br>might happen on any of the bright lines<br>that's where you would expect the<br>particle to turn up so boom light<br>so and so this particle that can behave<br>like a wave<br>Pro produces this pattern but is<br>observed in a specific point and what<br>that is an illustration of is the extent<br>to which quantum mechanics relates to<br>probability so this is kind of where I<br>wanted to start this conversation that<br>we're going to have and so probability<br>is really important in how we think<br>about quantum mechanics and this<br>probabilistic description of things is<br>why there's been so much written about<br>quantum mechanics as being a sort of<br>weird type of physics and I think one of<br>the things I want to do is actually just<br>to push back on that a little and say<br>well it's probabilistic but we use it<br>all the time to do really cool stuff I'm<br>going to tell you about some of that<br>stuff so I want to just make that<br>connection first to say well it's<br>probabilistic but that doesn't mean that<br>it doesn't tell you how the world works<br>you just have to use it in the right way<br>and in the right<br>framework um how is it probabilistic<br>well<br>we think of these particles as being<br>described by a wave function function<br>just in the mathematical sense at some<br>shape in space if you like and that can<br>change over time um and that function<br>when you take the square of it you have<br>to multiply it by itself which I know is<br>just a mathematical thing um but once<br>you do that it gives you a description<br>of where the particle is likely to be a<br>probability<br>distribution and so yeah wave functions<br>are useful all of this business all of<br>this mysterious business of quantum<br>mechanics is really useful for doing<br>stuff and that's the stuff I want to<br>about<br>so this gets me to the point of the<br>shering equation which is what we and<br>when I say we I'm looking at various<br>people in this audience I'm looking at<br>Christa and I'm looking at step and I'm<br>looking at Anna and<br>I'm imma I I could I could point to more<br>people um there a lot of people in this<br>room who use this every day to generate<br>information that we refer to as abono<br>because it<br>is it's not guaranteed to be correct<br>because the way that we do simulations<br>introduces other approximations but it's<br>based on a fundamental truth that<br>quantum mechanical particles obey<br>certain laws and the shering equation<br>gives you a framework for this it's nice<br>and simple if you write it in its<br>simplest form which is what I'm going to<br>do here here um we can write this<br>various ways but simplest form it's just<br>a hamiltonian which is something I'm<br>going to explain in a minute and way<br>function which I've already told you is<br>just a a function in space and the key<br>thing is that using this Honan thing<br>gives you an energy and when you know<br>what the energy is of something you know<br>how it's going to behave in physical<br>terms that's the goal it's a really<br>useful<br>equation um this is just to show you an<br>example of what be h tonian might look<br>like it's just a function and in typical<br>terms it is something that combines the<br>kinetic energy of a particle so you've<br>got something moving through space and<br>it's got some Mass which is on the<br>denominator of that first term you've<br>got planks constant in there because<br>it's a quantum mechanical particle and<br>that's just how it goes um and so that's<br>moving through space and that tells you<br>about its kinetic energy and then<br>there's some potential energy which is<br>just whatever forces you might think of<br>being applied to that particle whatever<br>it's interacting with<br>and so we have such an equation and in<br>the context of the work that I do these<br>particles are usually electrons they<br>usually interact with other electrons<br>they repel each other they like to be<br>attracted by nuclei that means that<br>atoms interact with each other in<br>interesting ways means we can make<br>materials out of them and those<br>materials can be persuaded um to do<br>interesting<br>things so this is what we do this is<br>just an equation that shows you that you<br>can really get<br>directly from solutions to this equation<br>and that's just the the particular<br>solution that you have for the hydrogen<br>atom okay so I put this up just to work<br>through the fact that<br>despite the quantum mechanical behavior<br>of particles tending to be referred to<br>as though it's a bit mysterious and comp<br>complicated the Machinery of quantum<br>mechanics actually is very well<br>developed applicable and it gives us<br>access to a lot of very reliable<br>information<br>so that's the key the key sort of<br>takeaway from this part of the talk and<br>this is not new um so this is one of the<br>things I like to to go back to is that<br>um Paul Adrien Morris dur in<br>1929 uh and his Nobel lecture talked<br>about the underlying physical laws<br>necessary for the description of<br>basically physics and chemistry are<br>completely known there are some<br>exceptions in physics he did say large<br>part little caveat there there's still<br>some jobs of some of my colleagues which<br>is good I see Richard looking at me um<br>but the difficulty is that exact<br>application leads to equations much too<br>complicated to be soluble um so that's<br>an old quote it's kind of useful in this<br>context part of the response to this<br>quote is that now we have supercomputers<br>and we can actually solve<br>equations to a much greater extent than<br>what was possible in his day and so yeah<br>we we we take this a lot further and<br>I'll give you some examples of the kinds<br>right um sperical cows are just a joke<br>in physics we like to make things as<br>simple as possible in order to solve the<br>equations um and I would say what was a<br>spherical cow in durat day now has<br>individual hears on its coat that have<br>texture that's the sort of maybe the<br>metaphor in terms of how computational<br>um uh facilities have have<br>developed<br>okay um so a little Riff on actually<br>what is the most important point of the<br>double slit experiment that I didn't<br>really cover um despite saying it's a<br>very important experiment it's not<br>really the wave particle duality part of<br>the experiment it is the fact that<br>observation of a particle matters in<br>quantum mechanics in a in a funny way<br>and so the thing is that if you close<br>one of the slits you'll go from having a<br>particular pattern created by<br>interference<br>between um the wave function of the<br>particle that comes through the two<br>different slits if you close one of the<br>slits then you'll go back to having a<br>pattern that is just created by a single<br>particle going through a single slit and<br>if you try to capture and if you try to<br>detect which of the slits the goes<br>through and if you think of the<br>particles moving in a particle like way<br>um you have to imagine them going<br>through one slit or the other um and yet<br>if you try to do that and you figure out<br>where one of the particles is you<br>actually localize it in space in some<br>sense in the same way that when you have<br>the detection of a particle that in<br>principle is contributing to this big<br>pattern you're you're finding that it is<br>in a particular space that it's way<br>function therefore changes to be defined<br>that it must be in at that<br>space and so we have these wave<br>functions they're just these are are<br>just some examples of what they look<br>like for hydrogen you know some<br>three-dimensional clouds clouds is<br>probably the best way to think of them<br>in in physical space that describe where<br>your particle might<br>be um oh yeah okay I have<br>slightly that's right um and so these<br>solutions to the hydrogen equation which<br>give you these kinds of wave functions<br>are none other than exactly the same<br>electronic states that give you the<br>periodic table so we can solve the<br>shreding equation for the hydrogen atom<br>we can set out a whole ladder of<br>quantized states and these states map on<br>to this um periodic table structure you<br>it looks a little bit like it's got some<br>special bits of pieces but<br>mathematically it all comes out of uh<br>the quantum numbers for the hydrogen<br>atom and but this is what I was I was<br>referring to I think I had my slides<br>mixed up in my head um on the left we<br>have an example of this uh interference<br>pattern for a single slit and on the<br>right we have an example of the<br>interference pattern for two slits and<br>yeah and and what you find is that when<br>you detect where a particle<br>is<br>um it no longer behaves as though there<br>were two slits you end up with the with<br>the single<br>particle um interference<br>pattern right and so this leads me<br>into a conversation that I'd like to<br>have about positionality observation of<br>where something is being a fundamental<br>Concept in quantum mechanics<br>and discussion or<br>awareness of where you are being quite a<br>fundamental Concept in<br>feminism all right that was a bit of a<br>segue but nobody got too confused<br>looking hopefully my title captured the<br>fact that I was going to do this at some<br>point all right so um yeah<br>maybe maybe we have to think about what<br>it is that we're supposed to know about<br>particles there's a um there's a<br>narrative in the way that we teach<br>quantum mechanics that says that<br>something is wrong because we don't<br>understand everything and on the one<br>hand yes uh we're in the business of<br>trying to understand more but whether we<br>should know everything everywhere all at<br>once which is what the fundamental<br>problem of quantum mechanics comes down<br>to I don't know maybe maybe we shouldn't<br>and shouldn't a bad word to use with<br>physicists because you know who who who<br>makes the rules but but you know we<br>don't necessarily need to know<br>everything everywhere all at once and I<br>guess this is the fundamental thing<br>about quantum mechanics we know quite a<br>lot and we can use quantum mechanics<br>very usefully um but we don't know<br>everything everywhere all at once it's a<br>great movie though um it is connected<br>fundamentally to the topic of the<br>conversation because the idea that there<br>are multiple parallel worlds a<br>Multiverse is something that comes out<br>of this this idea that when we observe a<br>particle it must be localized somewhere<br>and in some other world the rest of the<br>wave function that you've sort of Lost<br>in the world where you've observed it in<br>a particular place that must go on to do<br>something else um it's a great movie but<br>people are not Quantum particles I'll<br>just that yeah anyway we will leave it<br>there um<br>positionality um I won't read this out<br>in full but I think it ctures a little<br>bit what I want to talk about in terms<br>of not just who we are<br>um as scientists uh a little bit about<br>who about how we choose what we work on<br>how we how we Define ourselves um and<br>the goals of the work that we<br>do so I think there's there's quite a<br>lot to be said about the questions we<br>choose to ask as scientists um this is<br>actually something that connects to<br>various aspects of my CV that Jr pointed<br>out earlier um but this is the the<br>narrative I'm going to take you on um<br>tonight so this is just a map of or a<br>graph of the abundance of different<br>elements on Earth and some of you will<br>have seen it before it's it's passed<br>around more and more commonly these days<br>I find um but for those of you who<br>haven't seen it on the left you've got<br>things that are abundant so um in the<br>Green Space there you've got things like<br>Silicon sodium calcium um you've got got<br>early Metals in the parodic table that<br>react really um immediately with oxygen<br>and they form rocks and and you never<br>find those Metals in in Elemental form<br>on Earth but there's lots of them<br>they're just in in the rocks and then<br>you go to heavier Metals in the paric<br>table things generally become more rare<br>um the rare Metals actually aren't very<br>rare which is a particular bug beer<br>because of the way people talk about<br>these things in the context of<br>Technology um but you've got in blue<br>there are what called the rare rare<br>Earth elements um and then in yellow<br>you've got things that are actually rare<br>that you don't have much of on Earth and<br>I think this is a a useful description<br>of the data because it helps people<br>think about particular<br>questions I also think it connects to<br>something really important which<br>is a bit about what we do as academics<br>in research why there's such a strong<br>why there's why there should be why<br>there why there is why there should be<br>why there should be such a strong<br>connection between research and teaching<br>in a university um because new knowledge<br>in in some sense is about changing the<br>way that we see things changing the way<br>that we think about things um and I<br>remember this from a few years ago<br>reading a really um powerful essay on<br>the the importance of the first um space<br>travel<br>simply it's an old slide with a timer on<br>it um simply because it created the<br>possibility for people to see Earth from<br>outside and that that simple reframing<br>of where it is that we live collectively<br>does change the way that we think about<br>things and for me um this is intimately<br>connected to the previous slide go back<br>quickly um and the abundance of these<br>elements on Earth because when we think<br>about doing Material Science and I'm<br>going to get there to talking about some<br>of the work we do<br>um we we think about using these<br>different elements to do different<br>things but these are all Limited in the<br>quantities that they exist in on Earth<br>um everything here is finite we've got<br>so much of it and that's it<br>right so much of it um except that<br>aridium which is very rare and is in<br>appr pressable quantities and meteorites<br>that occasionally fall to Earth so we do<br>have a bit more of that increasing over<br>time everything else is fixed and so<br>when we think about the Earth and we<br>look at this<br>planet um we have choices as scientists<br>about what questions we want to address<br>and and what science we want to do this<br>is an old um news story about Steven<br>Hawking who you know would look at some<br>of the the data about um the challenging<br>challenges the world is facing and and<br>would say well we've got a thousand<br>years to find a new place to live which<br>is one response um he updated his<br>prediction not too long after um the<br>date is on the slide because it's just<br>after Trump was elected it's an old joke<br>but it still works um and and the thing<br>is it it builds into something in<br>popular culture uh which is really<br>commonly seen in in sci-fi so this is<br>the movie interstella and the one of the<br>taglines in the in the movie is we're<br>not meant to save the world we're meant<br>to leave it um and you know nothing<br>about nothing against the people who<br>work on um matters relating to space<br>science in the in the audience so but<br>I'm just going to go why not both and um<br>you know why not use our understanding<br>of the earth to to work on matters of<br>sustainability<br>um living in the southern hemisphere<br>we're kind of used to the idea that<br>shifting the way that you look at a map<br>shifts your perspective and I think this<br>is something we we need to ask ourselves<br>to do as scientists so uh this is<br>perhaps the self-indulgent part of the<br>of of the talk um talking a little bit<br>about uh how we reframe what we do as<br>scientists<br>so um when I became one of the<br>co-directors of the McDon Institute a<br>few years ago now um one of the first<br>things we focused on was this<br>conversation about how do we really<br>choose and articulate a purpose for our<br>research that brings people together uh<br>to want to do more of it um so we held<br>this this forum and to Papa and and<br>Wellington talking about what we called<br>materialize really trying to articulate<br>this connection between Material Science<br>and<br>sustainability uh with the vision<br>being that uh you know Material Science<br>is something that is useful for a high<br>wage low environmental footprint economy<br>um and I'll talk a little bit about some<br>reasons why but one of the speakers who<br>came to materialize um from Colorado in<br>the US Amy PTO I'll always remember the<br>talk she gave because she was very very<br>direct and in a much more<br>straightforward way than I'd ever heard<br>anyone say the same thing which was just<br>well you know we work in such a large<br>parameter space as scientists we can<br>work on so many different things the<br>choices that we make matter and so why<br>would you not use your values<br>to determine the things that you work on<br>why would you not so she was talking<br>about um making batteries that are<br>recyclable that are made out of Cheaper<br>non-toxic metal elements um but yeah<br>that that was that was the statement<br>that really um U that has has remained<br>with me from that meeting and so this is<br>what we do at the McDonald Institute I'm<br>going to start at the top level and I'll<br>get as far as some of my own research um<br>before we wrap up uh and so this is the<br>current website the the themes of<br>research that have come out of that um<br>conversation with a large number of<br>people about the kind of research that<br>we should do and you actually we we<br>invited a lot of people to that meeting<br>because we wanted to know what people<br>thought we should work on so these are<br>our four research programs in The<br>Institute towards zero Waste<br>reconfigurable Systems towards zero<br>carbon cataly AR architectures and<br>towards low energy Tech hardware for<br>future<br>Computing and then the fourth is<br>sustainable resource use the Matari<br>research program which connects to all<br>of the other three in in various<br>ways okay so reconfigurable systems<br>here's my little graphic we're talking<br>about making materials in ways that<br>makes them more um<br>inherently um sustainable you can make<br>things and you can unmake them right um<br>and so I'm just going to mention y drka<br>travit who's here in the audience who's<br>the program leader for this area of<br>research with us also Jeff is involved<br>um on the self assembly of particles<br>side it's yeah it's a fun<br>topic uh there's also our catalytic<br>architectures plan this one is very much<br>connected to energy transitions uh how<br>we deal with CO2 emissions um and I'm<br>really pleased Anna Garden is here<br>because she's one of the people involved<br>in this looking at um how we make<br>catalysts that could for example and<br>this is really ambitious and it's a very<br>long-term goal in terms of where the<br>science is going but taking CO2 out of<br>the atmosphere and using it to make<br>things that are<br>useful um plants can do it we'd like to<br>get better at it um and it's something<br>that's that's being looked<br>at and<br>and is also giving a colloquium and<br>physics tomorrow 2 p.m I forget the room<br>but yeah um just a we adver she will<br>talk more in detail about that stuff<br>hardware for future Computing um and<br>this is a third topic that I'm really um<br>uh this is perhaps the one I'm I'm most<br>involved in in some sense looking at<br>Assemblies of Nano structures that can<br>be used for what's called intrinsic<br>Computing um so trying to make things<br>that process information more like the<br>brain um and there are other forms of<br>future Computing that are being<br>developed with the goal being to reduce<br>the energy use required by computers in<br>the future because yeah computers are<br>energy Glutton and there's an irony in<br>this of course because all the work that<br>we do uses supercomputers to solve these<br>um complex equations uh to get answers<br>about the way materials work uh but we<br>have to think a little bit long term<br>about how we're going to be able to<br>maintain our use of such<br>computers and then the fourth um program<br>oh actually I forgot my shout out on<br>this one where's Natalie oh there she is<br>yeah so Natalie's um the project leader<br>for the project I'm involved in on resat<br>Computing here okay um and then our<br>fourth one is around sustainable<br>resource use the mat research program um<br>so this is a picture of James at F<br>Village taking a water sample looking at<br>the content of the<br>the hot palls that they have there um<br>so<br>sustainability I guess all of these<br>these research topics are unified by<br>this concept that sustainability is<br>something we should care about<br>um<br>yeah there's something there's something<br>more to it than that in terms of it not<br>just being about material sustainability<br>and that's I think the thing I've been<br>trying to think about and and putting<br>this talk together so that's where I'm<br>going to<br>go<br>um yeah so we have the choice of what it<br>is that we work on we have the a lot of<br>choice actually um and a lot of<br>privilege as academics to choose what we<br>do um both<br>in in particular in search Direction<br>although it can often be influenced by<br>external factors that we can't always<br>control but but we do have a lot of<br>privilege and it's important to<br>recognize that I'm very conscious that<br>I'm here as somebody who uh by virtue of<br>giving this talk um has quite a lot of a<br>lot of privilege and so that's a<br>starting<br>point okay um but none of us are<br>completely free right I um made this<br>joke when was it a couple of years ago<br>at uh at the um Misa boot camp in tianao<br>I think Natalie was there and where's<br>Charlie oh there's Charlie because I<br>looked at him I remember looking at him<br>and I thought he was going to answer the<br>question and he was like no I don't know<br>what you're on about he's probably going<br>to do the same tonight it's just fine um<br>I'm not going to put you on the spot<br>actually but we we were talking a little<br>bit<br>about um I don't know I guess I was<br>riffing on quantum mechanics as a<br>metaphor for understanding the world and<br>I asked what the what the wave function<br>is of a free<br>particle um and um and was we were<br>talking about this because in some sense<br>a free quantum mechanical particle is a<br>useless thing it doesn't exist it has a<br>very well- defined way function you can<br>solve lots of problems with it but it's<br>it's it's much worse than a spherical<br>cow it's like a<br>spherical I don't know it's not even<br>spherical it's like a a a cow with no<br>mass and no no<br>dimensionality um and and<br>so a better starting point and where we<br>do start when we teach quantum mechanics<br>is is with a particle in a box because<br>you have boundary conditions you have a<br>potential you have a limit to where the<br>particle can be and so that's what this<br>is describing some wave functions on the<br>left different energies associated with<br>the amount of curvature that you have in<br>the wave function uh the energy<br>increases going upwards on this little<br>diagram<br>um and that wave function tells you<br>where the particle can be um you have to<br>square it to get something that actually<br>tells you about the probability because<br>it's all positive um but that yeah you<br>put constraints on something and you go<br>from a wave that is infinite and goes<br>off forever and that tells you nothing<br>about your particle whatsoever to having<br>some meaningful information and so<br>my way of thinking about this is that<br>constraints are actually what Define us<br>right we put boundaries on what it is<br>that we do and what we want to do and<br>purpose<br>anthropomorphism um so this is where I'm<br>getting into the we're going to talk<br>about atoms as people part of the talk<br>which is you don't actually have to join<br>me in this I just do it so I'm just<br>confessing up front but um that I<br>anthropomorphize atoms um I talk about<br>them as wanting to do this or that and<br>people bear with me when I do it usually<br>but but it is a matter of thinking about<br>them as existing in a complicated world<br>where there are constraints on their<br>behavior because of the interactions<br>that they have and they might want to do<br>this as a consequence or they might want<br>to do that as a<br>consequence um I do think it's kind of a<br>useful way I'm going to just I'm going<br>to advocate for my way of thinking about<br>Adams for a moment um because we we<br>control materials all the time by<br>thinking about their reaction to<br>external conditions so you can take<br>water from your tap and put it in an ice<br>block tray and stick it in your freezer<br>and a certain temperature will freeze so<br>we control materials all the time by<br>knowing um the the pressure temperature<br>dependence of their properties we can<br>also do this as a function of the number<br>of atoms by this little symbolic in here<br>uh we can do that as a function of the<br>composition by having a number of atoms<br>of different kinds and some sort of<br>mixture that we're going to simulate for<br>a particular purpose and so this is what<br>we<br>do um so an example of the kinds of<br>questions that we're interested in is<br>asking why things behave the way they do<br>so I've got two examples of systems<br>we've worked on um on the left there's<br>Mercury um and on the right there's<br>gallium they're both metals that melt at<br>very low temperatures but if you ask the<br>question<br>why it's not something you can answer<br>unless you can get down to that Atomic<br>level and say why are the atoms behaving<br>this way what do they want to<br>do um you know quantum mechanics can<br>tell you about how many electrons they<br>have little bore model um pictures of<br>the atoms but it takes complicated<br>simulations to actually figure out<br>what's going on so little mention of ela<br>who's in the audience here who um is one<br>of the people who solved this question<br>of why Mercury melts at a low<br>temperature it's because of relativity<br>you should talk to ELA about it um<br>little mention of Christa who worked<br>with me on this problem of gallium and<br>why it melts at a low temperature<br>actually we don't have the full answer<br>to that yet we're still kind of obsessed<br>with it but we know that it's more about<br>the co valency of the bonding between<br>the atoms um maybe more about the<br>dimensionality we're still riffing on<br>this a bit um but yeah so one of the<br>things that we've worked on quite a bit<br>is liquid metals and I think one of the<br>reasons for this is simply that Metals<br>require quantum mechanical descriptions<br>of the atoms and the way that electrons<br>want to interact with each other<br>but when you're describing a liquid you<br>also need to deal with thermodynamics<br>and so you're bringing to um ways of<br>describing the system together in a way<br>that that means that the results you get<br>aren't always things that you expect<br>which is a good thing I think um if<br>you're looking for<br>interesting topics of study in science<br>and one of the key things that we've<br>been doing recently has been looking at<br>pattern formation in these liquid metal<br>systems so when I talk about the<br>McDonald Institute research I'll tell<br>you about the purpose of what we're<br>doing right materials for computing or<br>materials for um carbon capture and<br>catalysis but<br>fundamentally structure determines<br>function it's the arrangements of atoms<br>that determine how their electrons<br>interact with each other and therefore<br>what they are capable of doing so<br>structure determines function structure<br>includes size which is where the nanot<br>technology part of things comes in<br>dimensionality um aspect ratio the shape<br>of things and so I have an obligatory<br>explanation of Nano um<br>nanoscale uh systems here I've threw in<br>a a QE I'm glad I made Crystal laugh I'm<br>pleased about that um so this is a if a<br>nanoparticle was the size of a football<br>a kiwi would be as big as the world<br>which is<br>obviously<br>extreme um<br>so yeah I'm going to give you I think<br>I've only got three quick examples of<br>the sorts of things that we're working<br>on um the first is these nanoscale<br>patterns that emerge from liquid<br>metals and you can sort of see there's<br>two metals involved in these images and<br>the two different colors and the<br>patterns<br>um explain what those<br>are and what we want to do is figure out<br>how individual atoms are moving in this<br>collection of a whole lot of atoms um<br>slightly tricky thing to do and<br>experimentally there are lots more atoms<br>than what we can do computationally so<br>we've got to be quite careful about the<br>the way that we set something up the<br>number of atoms that we have in their<br>configurations but once we do that we<br>can map out the way that individual<br>atoms want to explore space um we can<br>map out their trajectories understand<br>their Dynamics and how uh they are<br>moving in the environment that they're<br>in and so what's interesting about these<br>patterns in metallic systems is that<br>they relate to to quite different types<br>of systems that obey nonetheless similar<br>underlying laws so touring patterns um<br>this is just a quick um image from your<br>know paper which talks about a dappled<br>pattern and so the key reference here is<br>that these these kinds of patterns are<br>made um occur many different places in<br>nature and it's it's a question of<br>understanding the underlying processes<br>that allow them to<br>emerge so um yeah quick side note this<br>is one of the things I really like about<br>doing research you get to read fun stuff<br>about all sorts of random things when<br>you're trying to figure out a problem um<br>knowledges transfer well it's a good<br>thing and so this is some recent work um<br>uh led by Steph and my group uh looking<br>at a particular combination of these<br>liquid metals and I'm just giving this<br>as a quick example to show how we can<br>calculate the energies so this little<br>plot on the right is the one to look at<br>and the green points just show how the<br>energy of the system tracks downwards as<br>the bis smouth which is one of the<br>metals moves to the surface of the<br>nanoparticle it just gives you an<br>explanation for what's happening that's<br>observed experimentally to form these<br>patterns at the surface um can we<br>explain yet why we get some patterns<br>under some conditions and some under<br>others not yet but we're we're it's<br>something that we're working<br>on um second example again liquid metal<br>systems and here I have a little<br>molecule um floating about interacting<br>with uh a liquid metal I I thought I'd<br>put a little video in with some atoms<br>moving about just to to give you a sense<br>of what it is that we do uh so each of<br>these atoms is being described Quantum<br>mechanically it's got electrons and<br>they're interacting with each other they<br>just look like balls in the in the video<br>as it plays but but they're all being<br>described based on these very well<br>understood and quite predictable rules<br>that come out of quantum<br>mechanics um and the periodic table this<br>is a slightly Whimsical version the<br>periodic table is also an example of the<br>predictability of of um what quantum<br>mechanics tells us about things we know<br>that different atoms behave in different<br>ways and we can relate that back to<br>these um electronic levels that come out<br>of solving the sheringer equation for<br>the hydrogen atom even though there's<br>such diversity in the way that these<br>different atoms behave it's all yeah<br>quite predictable um and<br>useful um there's also and I'm I'm not<br>going to spend any particular time on<br>this topic but um the idea that we can<br>combine atoms together into nanoscale<br>objects that behave as super atoms so by<br>basically manipulating the electrons and<br>where they<br>sit we can mimic the electronic behavior<br>of these very well understood real atoms<br>that have their certain energy levels<br>and the gaps between them that enable<br>them to do particular things um I was<br>slightly worried about throwing this<br>meme into a talk that had feminist in<br>the title but I thought I'd do it<br>anyway you can give me a pass I hope um<br>and so I'm getting close to wrapping up<br>um the the thing I the final sort of<br>scientific topic I wanted to cover<br>before I<br>do is the concept of a quasi particle<br>because I started this talk by<br>introducing particles quantum mechanical<br>particles and then the double um the<br>double slit experiment is something that<br>applies to all quantum mechanical<br>particles and we get to the<br>point<br>um in studying particles in complex<br>physical systems where the particle is<br>sometimes not the point anymore the<br>point in a physics sense is the behavior<br>of the particle and so quasi particles<br>are not fundamental particles<br>fundamental particles are what we like<br>to um find to to understand what the<br>world is made out of<br>but when it comes to describing<br>particles that are not spherical cows<br>that are not in isolation with very tidy<br>wave functions particles tend to exist<br>in an<br>environment and this is um this is maybe<br>the the tricky part of this this talk<br>but I'm going to go with it um and so<br>examples of quy particles you know you<br>can think of things that are not<br>fundamental particles but that are<br>required to to allow you to use Simple<br>physics to describe a phenomena so for<br>example CA pears and<br>superconductivity you you have something<br>other than the electrons in your<br>superconducting materials that you need<br>to describe in order to explain the<br>physics um phonons in solids that carry<br>heat through the solid would be another<br>example so quasy particles are very real<br>even if they're not fundamental<br>particles and the reason for this um the<br>reason for me introducing that topic<br>will become clear in just a second this<br>is a small digression for Jan's benefit<br>Jan are you asleep in the back<br>somewhere oh you're not you told me you<br>were going to be up in the back anyway<br>um so Little Star Trek moment for Jan<br>hope you appreciate it<br>Jan<br>um not going to go too much into the the<br>backstory um resistance is futile you<br>will be assimilated<br>uh the environment that we are all in<br>whether we are people or particles is<br>something that mats there we go that's<br>my my connection I'm remembered where I<br>was coming um and so this the title of<br>this and the use of this gift actually<br>comes from a a chapter in this book that<br>I mentioned as one of my citations<br>earlier ghost stories of Darwin and<br>there's a there's a we um chapter in<br>this that is talking directly about the<br>um the experience of being a woman in<br>science let's say and so this this idea<br>that you will be assimilated by the<br>culture that you are part of is<br>something really real and not<br>necessarily bad not always but in a<br>culture which has slightly problematic<br>questions and quantum mechanics tests<br>asking about um with with it being a<br>joke that the man is always right for<br>example the culture that you're in<br>matters and so I I like to think that<br>resistance is not futile but I also<br>think that you will be<br>assimilated and so the resistance that<br>makes sense if you put those two ideas<br>together is that the thing that we can<br>all<br>right okay I couldn't give a talk that<br>had quantum mechanics in the title<br>without talking about the cat in a<br>box so I have a cat in a box um<br>sometimes refer to a shing as catch um<br>we'll talk a little bit about<br>that um so this is a thought experiment<br>um that was famously put together by um<br>shinger about a cat in a box where the<br>cat is really just a Quantum particle<br>because cats aren't Quantum so it<br>wouldn't work otherwise um but<br>metaphorically the cat that is a Quantum<br>particle is in a box and you kill the<br>cat um by having a poison released into<br>the box which is statistically<br>controlled and so at a particular moment<br>in time there's a 50% probability that<br>the cat is dead and there's a 50%<br>probability that the cat is alive<br>but because of the role of observation<br>in quantum mechanics until you open the<br>box the cat is both dead and alive at<br>the same time because you have not<br>observed it it's it's a metaphor I like<br>metaphors in most cases I'm awkward<br>about this one right now I'm not sure if<br>you can tell um I think that will become<br>clear why in a moment so the cat is not<br>a Quantum particle so this does not<br>happen to real cats but this idea that<br>things exist in two states at once until<br>they're observed is is a real thing<br>uh but I talked in the abstract about um<br>not trading as catch but that we might<br>indulge I've got a few minutes left um<br>in the thought experiment of putting<br>Schrodinger in a box and so I'm going to<br>explain what I mean by that and I'd like<br>you all to give this a couple of moments<br>of thought um towards the end of the<br>lecture so there's this<br>um uh paper that was published by um<br>some colleagues um couple of whom I know<br>ago on the Peril of politicizing<br>Science and it's got you know it starts<br>with an aw quote that tells you a little<br>bit about where it's coming from um yeah<br>won't tell you too much about the the<br>authors other than that I have um a good<br>amount of respect for them um but it's<br>it's it's one of these<br>um pieces of work in the scientific<br>community that has addressed the issues<br>of what is known as cancel culture quite<br>directly um and so these are two<br>excerpts from the paper that I'll um<br>just read out it talks about cancel<br>culture as a real thing this is not an<br>ironic reference to cancel culture um<br>and in this paper they they raise the<br>idea that recent<br>discussions um around the this the<br>centuries old tradition of attaching<br>names to Scientific Concepts such as<br>let's say Shing his cat and discoveries<br>um has been<br>um um not attacked undermined challenged<br>uh by people who are saying well we<br>actually need to be careful about what<br>we name after whom because using names<br>that are based around inclusive<br>priorities might actually help science<br>progress further um they say really on<br>what empirical grounds is this based I<br>think they probably needed to go and<br>read some social science literature that<br>might tell you a bit about how you get<br>towards greater inclusion but leaving<br>that aside this having been written by<br>some chemists they then go on later in<br>the paper the authors call for removing<br>the names of people who cross the line<br>of moral or ethical standards examples<br>include haror Peter deby William shley<br>but the list could have EAS been<br>extended to include Stark doesn't mean<br>Iron Man<br>um<br>Heisenberg the explanations are up there<br>and<br>shinger um and I'm just going to point<br>out that this is written by the people<br>who said that we should not be not<br>naming things after these people because<br>that's Council culture so those people<br>see<br>these are understood facts that these<br>things are true so there's no particular<br>debate about whether or not Shing a had<br>romantic relationships with underage<br>girls for<br>example um also there's a lot of<br>evidence in the literature um on various<br>areas but this is just one from<br>chemistry from a talk I did about the<br>parodic table a few years ago um which<br>points out that there's a lot of things<br>in science that have been named after<br>the wrong person by any objective<br>measure right so uh<br>vadium was discovered in 1831 in Sweden<br>it was also discovered in Mexico about<br>30 years earlier was given a different<br>name which one stuck well actually it's<br>it's pretty much a a um a matter of<br>historical accident if not bias right so<br>lots of things have been named<br>after things that or people or<br>objectively<br>merited um and so you know shringer is a<br>real um example of something that we<br>should be more careful about um School<br>of physics this is Trinity College<br>Dublin uh renamed their Shing electure<br>theater to be just the physics lecture<br>Theater which is nice I think physics<br>lecture theater one has a good ring to<br>it that's where we are um yeah physics<br>lecture theater it's nice and simple<br>let's go with that call it what it is um<br>so they did this is it cancel culture<br>well maybe it is but that doesn't mean<br>it's not merited um I've got a little<br>bit of text from Wikipedia up here I<br>don't want to read all of this out got a<br>couple of um um names of the the young<br>women who were named um in in various<br>biographies of shringer this is well not<br>particularly contentious um factually he<br>kept a<br>diary um and you know he really is<br>talking about pedophilia<br>here so I yeah<br>us<br>um maybe we just leave them there um I I<br>don't know for me it's a real struggle<br>because it's you know I've been talking<br>about the shinger equation my whole my<br>whole career um that doesn't mean I<br>should keep doing it I think uh I've<br>heard the quantum wave equation<br>suggested as a pretty sensible<br>description that we should perhaps start<br>using um the cat is not a cat anyway so<br>you know talking about the cat in a box<br>doesn't particularly need his name and I<br>think we could come up with other<br>thought experiments at times that might<br>be more creative or more um culturally<br>useful more modern ways of talking about<br>the same physical<br>Concepts I think the way we use language<br>the way we refer to Concepts the<br>metaphors we use all of these are are<br>culturally dependent and and we can<br>better um this is a nice repost um a<br>year later to the original piece and so<br>I'm just going to leave you with some<br>words from it um on the debate over free<br>speech inclusivity and academic<br>Excellence um to defend an essay on the<br>grounds that there should be no limits<br>on Free Speech without considering the<br>implications of that speech is to<br>pretend that words have no<br>consequences um we accept gatekeeping<br>every time we submit an academic<br>manuscript we've all got complaints<br>about the way that scientific work gets<br>PE reviewed at times we accept that<br>sometimes it might be a little bit<br>stochastic but hopefully it gets to the<br>right place<br>eventually journals are not required to<br>publish every submission in the name of<br>free speech um yeah it's hyperbolic to<br>equate a Publisher's retraction of an<br>opinion piece to totalitarian<br>repression um this is perhaps the the<br>nicer quote to end on our values our<br>priorities and our biases are reflected<br>on those we choose to honor and our<br>community sends a message about<br>institutional values when renames or<br>unnames a lecture an award or a building<br>so it's not canceling but<br>recalibrating institutions and<br>institutional values evolve over time<br>and the people who those institutions<br>choose to exalt should evolve in<br>tandem so I have some quick<br>acknowledgements<br>um I have a partial list of people I put<br>in some dots at the end because I know I<br>forgot a bunch of people um basically a<br>lot of people have worked with me and my<br>group over the the last few years um I<br>yeah really um wouldn't be here without<br>you uh a few colleagues um some of whom<br>I've really pleased um have managed to<br>be here<br>today<br>um yeah quite quite a few people who've<br>taught me one thing or another that has<br>become part of what I've talked about<br>tonight um I won't explain all of that I<br>might<br>riff a little bit on um one of the<br>things that I've most<br>appreciated since moving to the physics<br>department at Oakland and this was um a<br>slightly tedious um conversation that I<br>had repeatedly with Richard in the first<br>year in the department um and it was<br>sort of must have happened half a dozen<br>times and was probably more than that<br>but I'm trying to be yeah um and and it<br>was oh yeah you've been doing this oh<br>yes this is going on it's like that's<br>like you should join the equity<br>committee and one of the nicest things<br>about being in this place is that I was<br>always able to say Richard this Fred<br>Fred knows this department she's been<br>for forever she's doing it I don't need<br>to be on the equity<br>committee and then you know Fred's<br>service to the department<br>notwithstanding um Jan has also been um<br>amazing in you know stepping up and and<br>leading us through processes and and<br>conversations um based around inclusion<br>and Equity um and so one of the things<br>I've learned talking<br>about this kind of stuff um feminism as<br>it relates to the work that we do is<br>that often it's not actually about you<br>and that's kind of the the note I want<br>to finish this talk on um I'm very very<br>grateful to all the people on this list<br>for a range of different reasons um I'm<br>going to pop up a we um slide of these<br>are just photos I had on my phone so<br>sorry if you're not there it probably<br>means you didn't go walking with me in a<br>really pretty place which is where most<br>of the photos are from<br>um but I'm going to come back to that<br>concept of a quasi particle that I<br>introduced very briefly and I was<br>starting to flag of it at that point so<br>don't know how well I got it across so<br>I'm going to come back to it and just<br>say it's not actually about<br>individual Behavior as dictated by<br>whatever set of equations it's the<br>environment that we're in that is the<br>most important thing in terms of<br>dictating how we behave who we are what<br>we can achieve um and I'm yeah very<br>grateful to have been in a wonderful<br>environment for so much of my um<br>academic life so thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer
