you here<br>colleagues from the University friends<br>and visitors from outside of the<br>University those online and in<br>particular friends and family of Karen<br>your daughter Chloe mokopuna Isla

professor<br>at the University of otago with this<br>celebration to<br>allow friends and family to share the<br>rich Journey that our professors go on<br>to achieve this High status but actually<br>there is a selfish purpose as academic<br>leaders at the University we really<br>appreciate the time when we can do<br>nothing else but soak in the uh the<br>research the teaching the service from<br>one of our leaders to understand what<br>they have done over a wide career to um<br>to get to that position and it's not a<br>promotion that is taken lightly at the<br>University of otago there is rigorous<br>assessment<br>to get to this position that our<br>professors need to be excellent in their<br>field in research and teaching they need<br>to show outstanding service and in<br>particular leadership and then Karen we<br>of someone who exemplifies all of those<br>the dean of the College of Education<br>will give us more detail but I just want<br>to acknowledge<br>Karen's case what we'll hear about and<br>in reflecting on her<br>CV and her portfolio there are a huge<br>number of achievements all of which are<br>highly collegial in nature that Karen<br>brings people together and that's very<br>clear from her two Milestones from her<br>role in service of building research<br>capacity in the social sciences from her<br>impressive supervision record that when<br>you look at the list of names includes<br>many distinguished people who are now in<br>service here at the University from her<br>teaching from 100 level to 900 level and<br>in particular teaching that shares<br>collegially across the university things<br>like your methods paper Egypt 464 that<br>is going to be a Core paper for many<br>disciplines not just your own so please<br>accept our congratulations on behalf of<br>the University Karen and I'd now like to<br>invite the dean of the College of<br>Education to come and more formally<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>welcome to you all this evening our<br>family members colleagues and Friends of<br>Professor Karen Neon who've joined us in<br>person or online<br>my name is Vivian Anderson and I'm the<br>dean of ticket<br>the University of otago College of<br>Education<br>so it's my absolute privilege to provide<br>a brief introduction to Professor Karen<br>nyan's inaugural professorial lecture<br>this evening<br>Professor nyan's professional career<br>began in ototahi my hood where she<br>graduated with a diploma of teaching and<br>Bachelor of Arts and geography from the<br>then Christchurch College of Education<br>and University of Canterbury<br>after teaching for several years in<br>Christchurch secondary schools Professor<br>Nan took up lecturing roles at Lincoln<br>University Christchurch College of<br>Education and the University of<br>Canterbury<br>in 1999 Professor nian began work as a<br>research fellow at dunedin's Children's<br>issues Center becoming acting director<br>in 2001 and 2002. and then in 2002 she<br>took up a lecturing position at the then<br>University of otago Faculty of Education<br>moving to Dunedin College of Education<br>in 2007. following the merger of the<br>university and the College of Education<br>so Professor nin has been an integral<br>part of the College of Education since<br>then teaching education studies papers<br>across all levels from first year to<br>postgraduate<br>and since becoming a lecturer she's<br>supervised 19 doctoral students more<br>about that shortly seven master of Arts<br>students and 16 students completing 400<br>and 500 level research dissertations<br>it's a pretty phenomenal Testament to<br>her capability as a mentor and her<br>commitment to mentoring<br>from 2007 to 2009 following the merger<br>of the University of otago with the<br>College of Education Karen was<br>postgraduate coordinator providing<br>leadership in the development of<br>graduate and postgraduate Pathways and<br>in qualification upgrades for former<br>Dunedin College of Education staff<br>in 2016 she led she co-led the<br>establishment of a young woman in<br>leadership program for year 12 girls<br>from Dunedin high schools in this<br>Innovative program targets young women<br>who don't fit The Stereotype of an<br>extroverted leader and it's now in its<br>fifth year with growing enrollments<br>Karen's research expertise is extensive<br>and interdisciplinary spanning Human<br>Geography youth studies gender studies<br>and education and throughout her<br>research career she has brought critical<br>social theories to bear on topics as<br>diverse as geography field work<br>educational inequality gender and<br>sexuality neoliberalism and school<br>choice so schooling and politics<br>post-school transition qualitative<br>research methodologies academic writing<br>youth participation and youth activism<br>and that's my summary<br>Professor karenin has been principal<br>investigator and investigator on two<br>Marsden grants which is a huge<br>accomplishment particularly for Scholars<br>in the humanities<br>and I believe she is the only education<br>scholar at the University of otago to<br>have held a Marsden<br>she's currently our associate Dean<br>research at the College of Education<br>I'd like to note that a distinctive<br>feature of Professor Nan's career has<br>been her commitment to mentoring others<br>in critical scholarship academic<br>research and academic writing and I'm<br>one of the many people who've benefited<br>from this work<br>I first met Professor Nan in 1987 as my<br>5nk form teacher and geography teacher<br>at Kashmir High School in ototahi<br>at the time she was someone we saw as a<br>wee bit radical<br>she was the only teacher in the school<br>who allowed us to call them by their<br>first name so it's pretty cool calling<br>you Professor Nyan tonight<br>switch<br>I met her again when as a post-docs wife<br>newcomer to Dunedin and Mum of two small<br>children I nervously set foot on the<br>University of otago as a new<br>postgraduate student<br>in 2004 Karen supervised my educ 480<br>dissertation and from 2005 to 2008 she<br>was the primary supervisor for my PhD<br>I found Professor Nyan to be a caring<br>committed and incisive supervisor whose<br>unrelenting search for conceptual and<br>linguistic Clarity and commitment to the<br>highest standards of ethical practice<br>provided me with much of what I needed<br>for a career in Academia<br>there is a wonderful Synergy in the fact<br>that as Professor Nan's former fifth<br>form year 11 and doctoral student I get<br>to introduce her lecture tonight<br>entitled Fierce hope in research with<br>young people<br>Professor neon Karen I owe you a huge<br>personal and professional debt of<br>gratitude for your teaching mentoring<br>and life-affirming Mahi over many years<br>and it's no exaggeration to say that if<br>it wasn't for your work as an academic<br>Mentor I would not be here introducing<br>you as Dean<br>so it's a real honor to celebrate with<br>you your wonderful work and this<br>well-deserved promotion like all of us<br>here I look forward to hearing what you<br>have to share with us this evening<br>more Professor Karen Lynn<br>foreign<br>to arua<br>kamihiakoto Deputy Vice chancellors<br>professors<br>Richard Blakey and Helen Thompson<br>Helen Nicholson<br>sorry to change your name like that<br>um Prof Vice Chancellor Jess Palmer<br>and the dean of takura<br>co-taitoka<br>so thank you Viv I'll say more in the<br>moment about<br>um<br>a<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>I grew up in ashburton and my dad worked<br>on the railways so our family moved<br>around a lot and this included the<br>formative years that I was referring to<br>in my pepiha living in otied<br>a village nestled in the Southern Alps<br>we're in the midst of Winter the sun<br>reached the valley floor and the village<br>between ten and two<br>and this is where my my mother undertook<br>her studies as a remote student to<br>become a placenta supervisor and<br>established the play center<br>at<br>otera<br>and rawati Hindu is here tonight for a<br>thank you for that wonderful<br>introduction<br>to be introduced by you as my Dean is<br>particularly special and I thought that<br>it would be good to include<br>laughs<br>and I want you to see if you can spot<br>um so it's it's fabulous to be working<br>alongside you yet again and your role as<br>Dean and um and to be introduced by you<br>tonight means so much and to have all of<br>you here tonight including those who are<br>here via live stream<br>um is so appreciated especially when the<br>weather<br>um is you know like so the woman's<br>welcome from me I am so pleased that<br>you're here<br>I'd like to begin with a whakatoki mamua<br>kakiti amuri mammuri Ka Ora amua<br>this whakatoki speaks to the importance<br>of working together<br>it acknowledges and values the<br>importance of both the leader and<br>followers for both our essential and<br>interdependent<br>this whakatoki is particularly apt for<br>Fierce hope and youth activism is the<br>title of our book due out in November<br>Fierce hope encapsulates the emotional<br>energy that drives my research with<br>young people<br>and I'd really appreciate Bridget<br>Williams our publisher for suggesting<br>Fierce hope as part of the title<br>so we're to begin my story of fierce<br>hope for equity and social justice for<br>young people<br>I could begin in high school geography<br>classrooms where I observed the gender<br>patterns of who talks in class and who<br>does not<br>or with my Master's research when I<br>experimented with women focused lessons<br>to see if relatable content might<br>Inspire young women to to speak up more<br>in class<br>all with my PhD research which was a<br>feminist analysis of University and high<br>school geography field trips<br>and you know I was particularly critical<br>of some of the physical geography field<br>trips which at the time tended to<br>privilege able-bodied heterosexual male<br>students in the in their design<br>or I could begin with Ann Smith and who<br>Marsden project about high school<br>students rights and her appointment of<br>me to do the research on that project in<br>1999 which brought me to otago<br>University<br>and all of us Mack Chloe and Amelia to<br>uh to Dunedin and our beautiful home on<br>the Portobello peninsula<br>I want to pause and acknowledge Ann<br>Smith<br>and her influential role on me as a<br>researcher<br>I know she was influential for you too<br>Alex and she would have been delighted<br>to see us both present our ipls this<br>year<br>and we're being proud<br>and also she was the inspiration<br>and gave me the best training and how to<br>do the work of a Marsden<br>and this IPL is the tale of my two<br>marsden's I've done lots of other<br>research but these are the big ones<br>the first is about young people growing<br>up during New Zealand's neoliberal<br>reforms and the second is about youth<br>activist groups<br>um and how that in effect in some ways<br>dealing with the consequences of those<br>reforms<br>the first is about the individualizing<br>impetus of neoliberalism and the second<br>is about young people how young people<br>have joined activist groups to<br>collectively challenge the injustices<br>I know this is simplifying the story so<br>let me unpack each of these research<br>programs in more depth<br>so the first<br>book children of rogenomics joined<br>forces with Jane Higgins who's here<br>tonight<br>and I'm delighted you're here from<br>Christchurch<br>and other members of that team Jude<br>Sligo I can see as well Jenny Monroe<br>Adrian Ormond<br>and also be frail were part of that team<br>the neuro liberal reforms at the fourth<br>labor government introduced in 1984 were<br>wide reaching and I know that I don't<br>need to go into all the Gory detail<br>the education reforms were particularly<br>drastic a supermarket businessman Brian<br>Pico LED tomorrow's schools and the<br>reconceptualization of Education as a<br>marketable rather than a public good<br>which urged us to consider consider<br>consumers rather than learners<br>the Marsden was about the generation of<br>young people whose entire schooling was<br>defined by these neoliberal reforms book<br>ended by economic crises of 1984 and the<br>global financial crisis of 2008.<br>in the two decades between these crises<br>were characterized by precarious<br>economic conditions for young people I<br>mean it was for everyone but<br>particularly for young people seeking<br>employment after their compulsory<br>education and by social change<br>so between<br>2003 and 2007 we've followed 93 young<br>people and what they thought would be<br>the last year of high school<br>wanted to find out how much the Leo<br>neoliberal discourses of choice<br>competition and you user pays have<br>permeated the way young people talked<br>about school their post-school lives and<br>their<br>lives in general<br>we recruited young people for that study<br>and walked from Auckland Christchurch<br>and a small Southland town<br>and a greater proportion were in the<br>last year of high school but we also<br>were really interested in those who<br>might be finishing school earlier and<br>recruited also from alternative<br>education program<br>some of our participants were peer<br>researchers paid peer researchers to<br>interview their peers because we thought<br>that some of our participants might be<br>more comfortable talking to someone of a<br>similar age<br>and in my research I've always looked<br>for innovative ways to engage with young<br>people including creative visual methods<br>for collecting data<br>we focused on how young people's<br>identities were shaped by neoliberal<br>discourses swirling about their<br>schooling<br>tertiary destinations and the world of<br>work<br>our conceptualization of identity is<br>beautifully portrayed in the words of<br>Chelsea a participant and a peer<br>researcher in the project who responded<br>to a question about what advice she<br>would offer other young people in their<br>post-school transition<br>I'm going to read the quotes partly<br>because I want to emphasize some of<br>their words and it's part of the story<br>don't be really set on what you're going<br>to do because it doesn't happen like<br>that<br>it's really good to have ideas about<br>what you want to do but it doesn't often<br>come about in the exact way that you<br>think it will<br>be prepared for the unexpected stuff and<br>kind of just go along with that<br>I think the whole strength thing is<br>really important<br>you know everything else around you is<br>going to keep on changing for the next<br>few years so being strong within<br>yourself and taking that time to know<br>who you are and the stuff work that<br>stuff out is really important so that<br>the other stuff doesn't totally throw<br>you<br>I think and keep having fun with it<br>because it does feel really like as soon<br>as you come out of use out of school you<br>know<br>what are you going to do<br>rather than who are you going to be<br>and how are you going to live your life<br>it's what are you going to do I think<br>that focus is something that I would<br>we interpreted Chelsea's comments as her<br>attempt to resist pressure to fix her<br>identity in relation to a particular<br>career destination<br>whose statement about being strong<br>within yourself and taking time to know<br>who you are indicates a reflexive<br>awareness of self and enactment of<br>rather than a rival at identity<br>it is in the doing that we come to be<br>we use doing in the same way that Judith<br>Butler does that through our actions<br>what we wear and say and do repeated and<br>reenacted over time we become<br>intelligible to ourselves and to others<br>for example socially established<br>meanings within discourses about how<br>young women and men should act<br>are reenacted every time they conform to<br>gendered Norms governing their behavior<br>giving the appearance that somehow these<br>Norms are natural<br>those who don't conform<br>expose the social significance and<br>consequences of these Norms especially<br>there were many in that first Marsden<br>who matched Chelsea's description of<br>being strong and who they were<br>culturally spiritually and what they<br>wanted out of life<br>and seeking work-life balance and in<br>their relationships with family partners<br>and peers<br>but there were there were some who<br>seemed buffeted by heightened<br>expectations<br>constrained by genders and racialized<br>norms<br>and Disturbed destabilize by competing<br>norms for example from family church and<br>the enactment of identities is also not<br>solely within an individual's control<br>it also depends on how identities are<br>read by others and on structural<br>constraints that limit the possibilities<br>of enactment<br>individuals made reference to their<br>identities being read in particular Ways<br>by family members teachers peers and<br>others<br>but there are less aware of the<br>structural constraints operating in<br>educational institutions and the labor<br>market<br>for example one young working-class<br>woman felt her plans to go from school<br>to tertiary education had been read by<br>others as having a chip on her shoulder<br>and something to prove<br>she thought that these readings imply<br>that her aspirations exceeded her social<br>class position<br>irrespective of whether her peers<br>thought this or not who a sense of other<br>people's opinions affected her sense of<br>entitlement to these aspirations<br>this sense was already fragile as the<br>first in her family heading for<br>University she was aware that she lacked<br>something her middle class peers clearly<br>had<br>she interpreted the slack in terms of of<br>brains more likely what who appears had<br>that she lacked was the self-confidence<br>to sum up sum up some of our key<br>findings<br>identity is enacted embodied and<br>constituted in relation to others and in<br>the context of social structures<br>neoliberal policies promise with<br>individual effort and education a<br>student loan<br>and tertiary qualification that you will<br>succeed in getting a well-paid job and<br>pay that loan back as though it's a<br>straightforward process<br>and this scenario structural constraints<br>disappear and individuals are assumed to<br>act independently it's all up to the<br>individual<br>the groups for whom structural<br>constraints such as institutional racism<br>matter most young Pacifica and Maori<br>those excluded from school<br>young working-class women and men<br>instead find themselves the subjects<br>of deficit discourses that hold them<br>responsible as individuals for the<br>after that first Marsden we still had<br>questions about young people's politics<br>and the role of the collective<br>neoliberalism exacerbated economic<br>inequalities and undermined collectives<br>and I wondered how this impacted young<br>people in particular which motivated me<br>so I'm fast forwarding to that second<br>one in 2017.<br>first I'd like to acknowledge my<br>fabulous team Joanna Kidman tinakoi I<br>know you're hoping to watch online<br>Carissa shoden tinakui<br>uh I also Judith who has survived two<br>marsden's with me and you might like to<br>talk to her after about that<br>um and Kyle Matthews and Amy I can see<br>you both in the audience and also<br>um Emma Barker Clark as well who each<br>provided research assistance at critical<br>so despite<br>having been steeped in neo-liberal<br>ideologies since birth many young people<br>are critical of the inequalities and<br>injustices they experience and Witness<br>the power of the collective that so many<br>in this Marsden<br>identified as eloquently expressed by<br>Jay from inside out cuador and I will<br>talk about the groups in a moment but I<br>want to begin here<br>I think that people power is everything<br>and I think that individualism is the<br>greatest lie that we tell ourselves<br>actually<br>you can pretend that you're just one<br>person and that you can do everything on<br>your own and that no one has influenced<br>you ever but realistically we are the<br>people that raised us we are the people<br>that were important to us and supported<br>and loved us growing up we're the people<br>that support us now and you can't really<br>do anything without the support of other<br>people<br>we are social creatures we need other<br>people we need communities and we need<br>to feel like we're part of something I<br>could not have done anything that I'm<br>we invited a number of activist groups<br>that have a majority of Youth members<br>and or young people in leadership roles<br>to tell us about their experiences with<br>activism<br>all six groups agreed to be named<br>and many activists in our study also<br>wanted their real names included in the<br>book that we've written from the<br>projects<br>so protect ehumatal is fighting the<br>impact of colonization by reclaiming<br>indigenously and confiscated in 1863<br>from a high cost Housing Development<br>see me Isla<br>just speak aims to reduce and ultimately<br>action station is a people-powered<br>online petition platform<br>addressing diverse social justice issues<br>including education in high schools on<br>sexual consent racism online and mental<br>health funding<br>Inside Out cuador is promoting rainbow<br>youth visibility and safety in schools<br>Thursdays in black and this was the<br>University of Auckland campus group it's<br>a nationwide organization but we worked<br>with the Auckland University group is<br>walking towards a few working towards<br>our future without sexual violence<br>and generation again we worked with<br>generation zero Auckland is working<br>towards a zero carbon future to address<br>these political Visions are radical and<br>socially Progressive while the tactics<br>employed range from reformists to<br>unorthodox<br>they cover a wide spectrum of<br>intersecting causes indigenous rights<br>climate Justice feminist and queer<br>rights and social and economic Justice<br>there has been a tendency to portray<br>youth activism as inherently radical and<br>somehow an innate feature of this life<br>stage rather than understanding how all<br>activism<br>including youth activism is shaped and<br>reshaped according to the culture and<br>political conditions of the time<br>between 2018 and 2021 we spent time with<br>each group attending Hui campaigns<br>actions and events following their<br>social media and websites attending<br>webinars and online events and generally<br>engaging in the diverse ways they<br>communicated their vision and actions<br>a total of 90 participants took part in<br>interviews about their activist Journeys<br>usually a year apart about what inspired<br>them to join the group and what kept<br>them involved or not so we also kept in<br>touch with those who had left their<br>groups<br>we also invited all the groups to<br>construct what we called a living<br>Manifesto of their group's vision and<br>I'll show you two of these in due course<br>we joked as a team that anyone younger<br>than us came under the umbrella of Youth<br>foreign<br>the majority of the activists were aged<br>between 18 and 35 at the time of their<br>first interview and we stretched youth<br>to and be inclusive of those who were<br>willing to engage in the research<br>reconsider this appropriate because<br>youth is relative to other age groups<br>and can be understood differently<br>depending on culture and context<br>for example to Al Maori age is not so<br>focused on how many years someone has<br>lived but more on what they've done<br>during those years and we're drawing on<br>Kerry or Pie's work here<br>conversely packing our perspectives on<br>age often focus more on chronological<br>age but even here the meaning of any<br>number varies by context such as class<br>and power relations<br>so youth is a slippery topic<br>having said all this<br>this Marsden was a deliberate attempt to<br>privilege younger rather than older<br>perspectives on what political and<br>social change is most important<br>the political agency of Youth has either<br>been celebrated as new and empowering or<br>denigrated as a threat to social<br>cohesion depending on the era the era<br>and the commentators political views and<br>I'm drawing on Zechariah and tanek's<br>work here<br>there was also a danger that describing<br>a political movement as you fled reduces<br>it to merely an age<br>or generation related issue<br>conversely claims of the Revolutionary<br>power and impact of Youth can obscure<br>how it is people in established<br>positions of power who are ultimately<br>the ones to decide what political change<br>will be implemented<br>despite these risks we believe it is<br>important to showcase the perspectives<br>of these six youth-led activist groups<br>which are addressing a wide array of<br>structural injustices<br>these young people want to make the<br>world a better place for everyone<br>they've often received praise and<br>support for representing young people's<br>perspectives and for their roles As<br>Leaders as well as some pushback for not<br>Kiani one of the leaders of protect<br>ehumatal provided the summary of all the<br>powerful forces shaping her activism<br>My Generation has seen parihaka and<br>bestian point and has seen women's<br>movements and has seen Donald Trump get<br>elected and what does that mean for the<br>world<br>and has seen Christchurch terrorism you<br>know all of these things we've seen them<br>plus we have a western education most of<br>us have gone to University and we're<br>also entrenched in our tikanga we've got<br>all these things that make us the people<br>the activists in our study are political<br>in the broadest sense across and within<br>the six groups there are diverse<br>political motivations for many<br>traditional forms of political<br>engagement are no longer considered<br>effective nor capable of real change and<br>revisioning<br>so Brook provides a particularly telling<br>example of this as she argues for an<br>intersectional approach to activism<br>my biggest fear is that now that<br>jacinda's in power people tend to think<br>that's the furthest left we you can go<br>women in power maybe affirms a false<br>sense of progress<br>but labor is pushing the neoliberal<br>agenda and what that looks like in terms<br>of an economy and how that affects<br>vulnerable groups or who are always just<br> over by that kind of thing like<br>people of color poor people<br>when we proposed the research we were<br>particularly interested in the role of<br>Hope in the desire to make the world a<br>better place<br>hope and encompasses a constellation of<br>emotions including anger compassion and<br>joy that help activists keep going in<br>the face of overwhelming odds bringing<br>people together in pursuit of their<br>the fight to save ehumatal from a high<br>cost Housing Development began in 2015.<br>in 2016 a small group occupied The<br>Farmhouse on the disputed

about their<br>memories of that day the emotional<br>rollercoaster was evident in tears and<br>County talks about in the first couple<br>of weeks I think I cried every day for<br>different things like I would see our<br>tamariki do something and I'd get<br>emotional and cry or I'd just see our<br>komatua and kuya do something and I'd<br>get emotional or I just think of people<br>that weren't here<br>or I think of our situation<br>so there was a lot of sadness and hurt<br>and pride and happiness but it came with<br>a lot of tears all those emotions<br>there's that weird emotion you want it<br>to end because you can't keep living<br>like this forever and we're all broke<br>and we've got to get back to the real<br>world but actually I like this new world<br>that we've created which is referring to<br>an optimistic vision is valuable for<br>motivating motivating people to come<br>together to work for change however this<br>motivating optimism can morph into cruel<br>optimism if the emotional energy<br>required for the pursuit of change<br>impacts negatively on activists<br>well-being or tips into naive hope when<br>the hope for out hopes for outcomes are<br>unachievable and we're drawing on Lauren<br>balance work there<br>the importance of hoping critically has<br>been addressed in other research which<br>notes the value of being clear about the<br>limitations of self and the obstacles in<br>the way as well as clarity about the<br>values we endorse and pushing against<br>these limits and obstacles to reach our<br>hope for hoped for ends and Victoria<br>mcgear's work has been particularly<br>Central for us thinking that through<br>explicit acknowledgments of hopelessness<br>frustration Despair and sadness helps<br>activists identify the obstacles to<br>change and can help equip them to tackle<br>these obstacles by hoping critically<br>being hopeful in a critical way can be<br>useful in avoiding the consequences of<br>cruel optimism and naive Hope by<br>acknowledging and then counterbalancing<br>the overwhelming challenges of achieving<br>change<br>in cordelia's description of what she<br>has learned over years of activism spent<br>fighting colonization and sexual<br>violence we discern how she's come to<br>similar conclusions<br>I think I'm moving towards a space where<br>it has to be necessary for me to avoid<br>this exhaustion and burnout feeling it's<br>like can I accept that people will hurt<br>each other in this world and at the same<br>time as accepting that can I also know<br>that there is a possibility that things<br>could be otherwise<br>and I think I need to try and hold both<br>of those<br>feelings<br>similarly can I accept that the climate<br>is changing rapidly and the future will<br>not be as we know it at the same time as<br>knowing that as humans we can slow this<br>or reverse it<br>I feel like this is something that will<br>help me<br>and maybe the action is the action of<br>just being with it I don't know I don't<br>know my kind of internal jury is still<br>out on that it's like I'm trying this<br>hoping critically rather than naively<br>was also evident amongst the climate<br>activists in our study<br>and this image portrays what's at stake<br>Dewey from generation zero<br>sees value in talking about emotions<br>ideals and reality when bringing people<br>into activist organizations in order to<br>hope is one emotion has to be actually<br>balanced with anger and I think that<br>anger is mainly pushed by the reality<br>I think that the reason why I'm having<br>the juxtaposition between idealism and<br>reality was because I started off being<br>idealistic but I kept going because of<br>the reality<br>if you look at reality right now not<br>much change is happening and I am<br>angered by that or I'm frustrated<br>so I think that talking about idealism<br>and reality is super important not just<br>in terms of bringing people in but in<br>social movements can create the<br>conditions for fostering Collective hope<br>through sharing and acknowledging the<br>emotional labor of activism paying<br>attention to activists emotional work<br>helps us understand what sustains them<br>in spite of the multiple obstacles they<br>encounter<br>maybe it's a bit of Hope and a bit of<br>anger and a bit of sadness all in this<br>one weird of motion of wanting the world<br>to be a better place<br>while anger at Injustice initially<br>mobilized many of the activists in our<br>study some question whether in the long<br>run anger sustains or is more likely to<br>impair their judgments and lead to<br>burnout<br>the emotional work of supporting others<br>in the face of overwhelming and<br>tractable issues such as colonization<br>climate change and sexual violence and<br>the frustration of two steps forward one<br>step back sense of progress is as<br>important as sharing the Practical tasks<br>of activism<br>we argue that hoping critically is<br>useful for understanding what practices<br>sustain groups and the difficult work of<br>social change<br>hoping critically opens offers One path<br>for recognizing the sheer scale of that<br>emotional work<br>at times hoping critically seems to<br>offer an antidote to cruel optimism to<br>pursuing change at all costs by alerting<br>activists to their limits and thereby<br>helping them to avoid burnout<br>for example activists felt guilty for<br>not doing more for not having pursued<br>more signatures on a petition for<br>missing meetings for taking a break<br>but we're also conscious of needing to<br>activists working on multiple fronts<br>represented by this project generated<br>hope that reverberated within and<br>between groups and across aotearoa<br>these two living manifestos were<br>produced by the groups<br>for their own purposes and they became<br>living manifestos for our research with<br>their permission I'm going to begin with<br>voices of ehumatal<br>and it was the concept of kyani Matata<br>sipu and Conan Fitzpatrick who<br>interviewed and filmed many of the<br>protectors at ihu martal<br>and the goal the goal was to take<br>Wilson won the prepared section of<br>namanu koriro waikato regionals with<br>this piece on why she is protecting her<br>fenua at ihumatal<br>is not a commodity and it is not a<br>a safeguard and protect for future<br>Generations<br>I have faith that we can all Stand<br>Together United on this copapa as we did<br>for the Dakota access Pipeline and as we<br>are for Mauna Kea in Hawaii<br>I'm so grateful for the display of<br>support for yumato it gives me hope that<br>even if we don't all know the history<br>and understand the significance of this<br>funeral to our ewe we do share an<br>empathy and understanding of Injustice I<br>have hope that with our physical<br>presence on the fenua a clear message to<br>our government has received that they<br>cannot ignore this issue my ancestors<br>did not keep quiet so neither can I my<br>ancestors ensured that our stories were<br>told and retold so that we never forgot<br>protective we are funeral protectors we<br>are kaitiaki we are warriors see you at<br>the front line<br>and the next one that I want to show you<br>is a collaboration between just speak<br>and action station who created and<br>imagined hopeful message from 2040.<br>and it's an animated video for Youtube<br>and I really like how Madeleine<br>described it one of the<br>um people involved from action station<br>the most important part was to get that<br>balance of helping people to feel<br>hopeful about the future but not coming<br>across as naive<br>together we created an audacious plan to<br>meet the challenges of our time and then<br>we made it happen<br>some people ran for Parliament While<br>others rallied social movements to build<br>people power for real change and some of<br>us got to work scaling up solutions that<br>already exist in our communities<br>papakanga Community Health hubs and so<br>much more<br>over the next 10 years we prioritized<br>the things that matter for healthy<br>people in a happy planet<br>and a big win for equality we finally<br>started paying care and support workers<br>a living wage we increased housing and<br>income support so that everyone had a<br>roof over their head food on the table<br>and time to spend with their loved ones<br>our financial stress reduced and our<br>mental health improved so fewer people<br>were swept into the justice system and<br>yes we transformed the justice system<br>too<br>we shifted our Focus away from<br>punishment and towards prevention<br>restoration and repair with fewer people<br>locked away in prison we had more<br>resources to build our zero carbon<br>economy<br>in the 2030s when we were struck with<br>record-breaking droughts and floods<br>we were so grateful to have started<br>acting when we did we became a society<br>that gave everyone what they needed<br>while caring for each other and for the<br>planet we were in a better position than<br>ever to navigate new crises without<br>leaving anyone behind<br>which brings us to today<br>waitangi day 2014. the day we got the<br>news that aotearoa would finally be a<br>country without prisons 200 years since<br>the tdt was signed sometimes it's hard<br>to believe how far we've come<br>then I just think about how hard we<br>worked and how compassionate and patient<br>we were along the way<br>and straight up it's not hard to believe<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>all the groups enacted the change they<br>wanted to see in the here and now as<br>well as imagining future possibilities<br>we finished the book with Tonga porutu's<br>questions because they are relevant to<br>all of us<br>I went to the climate map action March<br>and it's just that critical mass it's<br>like all these things are happening<br>because even if you're living in your<br>capitalist dream world there's an<br>eeriness to the feeling we're all<br>feeling it and so I guess I'm adding my<br>personal sentiments to the collective<br>feeling it's that constant questioning<br>all six groups were working against what<br>many would have viewed as insurmountable<br>odds nevertheless they persisted<br>significant winds were seen across all<br>of our groups but more work remains<br>recognition of what has been achieved<br>does not ignore the scale of the work<br>that lies ahead<br>change often happens through slow<br>transformation and the culture of a<br>society<br>watch what was previously inconceivable<br>becomes accepted<br>when we look back from the future This<br>research in the book will serve as a<br>reminder of the collective work done by<br>these six groups that prepared us for<br>the social Transformations that followed<br>and it will will remind us that action<br>is impossible without Fierce hope<br>my research has affected me profoundly<br>in the first Marsden about the children<br>of raw genomics I was struck by many how<br>many young people blamed themselves for<br>why they hadn't succeeded according to<br>the policies of the time<br>I remember one langata himari from<br>alternative education who was in paid<br>employment and saving for a house<br>and telling me that he didn't feel like<br>he had succeeded because he hadn't gone<br>but the neoliberal lessons of<br>individualism didn't Define this<br>generation and my work with young<br>activists a decade later demonstrates<br>the power of working collectively to<br>address social injustices<br>the sheer scale of what these six groups<br>achieved in the three years we worked<br>with them inspires my admiration for all<br>the young people we worked with<br>for me to be at ihumata the first<br>weekend of the Reclamation of the fenua<br>after the eviction of those living in<br>The Farmhouse at kaitiaki Village was<br>inspiring and humbling<br>I knew then that this was a historically<br>significant moment in important<br>political movement<br>I attended generation zero meetings in<br>Auckland with young people who had come<br>straight from work or university to<br>create to strategize and create<br>campaigns to get the zero carbon Act<br>passed and to do all kinds of things in<br>Auckland City itself including getting<br>aucklanders to reimagine how you could<br>use parking space for recreation<br>for you know children and people just to<br>hang out during the day<br>I did a small proportion of the<br>interviews with young women from<br>Thursdays in Black about the grinding<br>work of tackling sexual violence and<br>just speak staff about a reimagined<br>criminal justice system<br>Jude had the pleasure of working with<br>inside out and action station<br>the sum total of these experiences and<br>total immersion in everyone's words in<br>the writing of the book and journal<br>articles fills me with the utmost<br>respect for all the young people we<br>worked with<br>at the social movements conference in<br>2020 I organized a panel of leaders from<br>each of the six groups<br>they really felt like a Powerhouse that<br>day and I was amongst it<br>a small part of it<br>I'm not going to finish with some cliche<br>such as the future is incapable hands<br>because the responsibility for our<br>future is in all our Collective hands<br>we have responsibilities to be good<br>ancestors to Future generations and I'm<br>drawing on Christine Winter's work and<br>we're lucky that she has just recently<br>joined<br>otago University Kia Ora<br>these groups provide an excellent map<br>for how to be good ancestors as I worked<br>with young activists I became a Nana<br>so my full title is Prof Nanny K which<br>heightens my sense of responsibility to<br>act I'm convinced there is hope in<br>Collective action<br>to return to my opening opening<br>kakite<br>thank you all<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>Uma so I'm the pro Vice Chancellor of<br>the division of humanities and it's my<br>great pleasure to give the vote of<br>thanks at the end of the evening<br>so<br>what to say<br>just wonderful to listen and watch<br>someone demonstrate by talking us<br>through their two Master grants and what<br>a privilege and a pleasure for all of us<br>to hear that summary in such an<br>interesting way so thank you so much<br>Karen it struck me there are two things<br>that I wanted to draw out or or<br>emphasize from from your talk with us<br>tonight and one is that your research<br>has played such a vital role in<br>providing a critical reflection for us<br>on what neoliberalism has and hasn't<br>done for us<br>and you know I think for those of us in<br>University<br>you know we can provide examples of how<br>neoliberalism has really challenged us<br>so we now live in a in a structure<br>um that is the result of neoliberalism<br>and the policies that have come from<br>government that have premised what we do<br>now here in education as being largely<br>based on user pays in thinking about our<br>students as clients and as education is<br>the provision of a consumer good and and<br>those of us you know I look around the<br>room and I can see nods and I can see<br>you know eyes saying yep absolutely and<br>it's a it is in a sense um a tragedy for<br>us and a crisis that we need to help our<br>country work its way out of because it<br>isn't the right answer in the long term<br>and we're we're watching that play out<br>at the moment within our universities<br>and what it means for us and I just want<br>to join with you Karen and say that we<br>want to as Educators as universities<br>look on our students as fellow Learners<br>with us and your research shows that and<br>so I wanted to say thank you thank you<br>for reminding us of that thank you for<br>challenging us to continue to reflect<br>critically on what neurolipism hasn't<br>hasn't done for us<br>and secondly I wanted to emphasize and<br>draw out<br>one of the beautiful aspects of your<br>research and also one of the conclusions<br>of your research that our identity<br>cannot be formed by our own autonomy but<br>is indeed constituted by our<br>relationships with each other<br>and the way in which as a community we<br>respond to societal structures<br>and so in preventing your sorry<br>presenting your research to us you<br>demonstrated that very value<br>um by the importance of listening to<br>others and so it was lovely that so much<br>of your research tonight wasn't was an<br>actual fact the quotation of people that<br>you had studied and to hear the voices<br>of Youth and of activists teaching us<br>and I thought you just embodied and<br>lived out for us exactly the point you<br>were making that we have got to stop<br>thinking of ourselves as individuals and<br>start listening to our community as a<br>whole and then you know lovely to think<br>about<br>um your your thank yous at the beginning<br>and the people that you<br>um acknowledge at the beginning you know<br>that you made that point of being<br>mentored by the wonderful Anne Smith<br>um of being a collaborator a collab a<br>collaborator with Jane Higgins Judith<br>Sligo Joanna Kidman lots of others when<br>um Jessica<br>um and also you know that you've you've<br>played an incredibly important role in<br>mentoring others and so mentoring your<br>own research assistance and then there<br>was a wonderful story of being mentored<br>and taught by you so again living out<br>for us the point you are trying to make<br>that it is in our community that we find<br>identity and so thank you that your<br>research has done exactly that in Bravo<br>for doing that Karen<br>so Professor Nyan thank you thank you<br>for your Fierce hope for equity and<br>social justice for young people and for<br>what that means for the rest of us thank<br>you that you've chosen to be here at<br>otago and that we get to be the<br>I have the great pleasure of presenting<br>to you in a minute watch disappear ta-da<br>a small gift that's an acknowledgment<br>and a sign of our great appreciation for<br>the work you've done over the years and<br>for this wonderful achievement that you<br>truly deserve<br>foreign<br>I think a whanau presentation is is more<br>and to our wonderful audience to those<br>of you here with us tonight and those of<br>you who have joined online thank you so<br>much for joining with us thank you for<br>your presence to mark this occasion is a<br>really important one in in the in the<br>life of this University so hide Mi to<br>all of you please if you can if you're<br>able come with us over to the staff club<br>for some food thank you Isla you've been<br>awesome<br>come and join us<br>um<br>Irani<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>I just wanted to get up here tonight and<br>acknowledge Karen I said I would and you<br>know so here I am<br>and and and being that the first I I<br>believe I'm the first person to in this<br>room to know who we grew up together I<br>knew her even before Mick<br>and um I just want to acknowledge that<br>there's way way more to this picture and<br>I acknowledge also the wonderful<br>accolades around Karen's<br>education and her growth through and to<br>where she is now her standing where she<br>is now<br>but you know there's more to the person<br>I think I want to acknowledge all<br>together we both grew up and I know<br>Karen from there not from ashburton<br>um and there's something about that<br>place that I think speaks to the person<br>that she is<br>you know what a place to grow up<br>everyone used to say oh today actually<br>and<br>um then I how could you grow up here and<br>and she's right the sun disappeared<br>between came up at 10 in the morning and<br>disappeared at two and in the afternoon<br>and the middle of summer<br>but I don't know there's something about<br>our connection to that fenua that speaks<br>to the person that she has today so<br>there's much more and I think that came<br>through and part of her Corridor as well<br>that sort of idea that was not about<br>what we know in the world it's but it's<br>about who we're being and that has<br>developed<br>through the appearance and through our<br>grandparents and our parents parents but<br>also from where we grew up<br>and the connections that we made to that<br>place<br>you know and that sort of manifested as<br>well and us being friends and these<br>wonderful people here we all cycled<br>that's what we did we cycled around the<br>country and our youth and Karen and Mac<br>are still going today I'm still out<br>there biking but you know there's<br>something about that again around that<br>connection to the environment that we<br>live in that comes through in your<br>presentation Karen beautifully you know<br>it's not just about<br>well it is about all you know social<br>change and so on and so forth but it's<br>about the connections that we make and<br>this speaks to that person in terms of<br>her research and the connection she's<br>made to all the people that she's been<br>involved in<br>enough<br>that end I do want to finish with a<br>white because I think I sing better than<br>I speak you might not agree but<br>um I kind of um<br>so what's so quieter for this occasion<br>and this is it here<br>it's from Maisie Ricker she sings better<br>than me but anyway<br>the crest of my wave broken by the<br>southerly ones of no bounds crashing on<br>the sacred Sands of the future<br>consumed by the struggle to live I was<br>blinded and did not see your mother Your<br>Mother Earth warning signs therefore<br>provide sustenance to the world<br>revitalized to a full
