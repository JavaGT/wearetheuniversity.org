That order is now coming to an end. Although it is not certain what will replace it, the signs are pointing to a reassertion of power politics, the fragmenting of the regional economy, and the rise of new, small and exclusive groupings, from which New Zealand is currently absent.<br><br><br><br><br>In this lecture, Professor Capie discusses the rise and fall of the Asia-Pacific era, the challenges it raises for a small, open, democratic nation, and how New Zealand can prepare to face these challenges.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be

embassies and high commissions<br>our members of the public sector and a<br>broad range of other people from other<br>organizations<br>welcome everyone<br>to the inaugural lecture of Professor of<br>international relations David Cappy<br>I'm Jennifer Windsor acting Vice<br>Chancellor of tehringa Waka Victoria<br>University of Wellington and it's a<br>privilege for me tonight to help<br>celebrate David's contributions<br>David received his first class Bachelor<br>of Arts honors and Bachelor of laws here<br>before completing his Masters at the<br>Australian National University and his<br>PhD at York University in Toronto<br>he returned here in 2004 as lecturer in<br>political science and international<br>relations and has since become a widely<br>recognized expert on New Zealand's<br>foreign policy and conflict and defense<br>issues<br>he's written and spoken extensively<br>incisively and with influence on<br>Regional Security on bilateral and<br>multilateral relationships on arms<br>trafficking and peacekeeping<br>the significance of David's research and<br>teaching was recognized early in his<br>career<br>he received our award for excellence in<br>early career research in 2007 our<br>teaching Excellence award in 2012 and he<br>was nominated for the national tertiary<br>teaching Excellence award in 2013 the<br>2013<br>he's played a key role in establishing a<br>foundational International partnership<br>for the University with the Diplomatic<br>Academy of Vietnam through the master of<br>international relations<br>his more recently forged a strong<br>relationship with the New Zealand<br>Defense Force<br>since 2018 we've been privileged to<br>teach nzdf command and Staff College<br>Personnel through the master of<br>strategic studies<br>thus is an all-round scholar and<br>lucky though as director of the center<br>for strategic studies that we know<br>Professor David Cappy best<br>since 2016 he's led the center in ways<br>that have raised the international<br>profile of the University attracting<br>large public and smaller private<br>audiences to hear from Key International<br>experts on asia-pacific policy and<br>security issues<br>he is regularly sought out by government<br>the public sector and media to provide<br>insight and advice and he also engages<br>in track to dialogue<br>simply put<br>David is a very significant voice in a<br>very significant area<br>he's a go-to person who carries that<br>mantle with great professionalism in New<br>Zealand and abroad<br>New Zealand is a relatively small<br>country<br>we're involved in a number of<br>multilateral organizations and we have a<br>tradition of collective security<br>but now we live in an increasingly hotly<br>contested asia-pacific or indo-pacific<br>region<br>and in his lecture David will be talking<br>about an array of very timely issues<br>with the central one being of the<br>longtime asia-pacific era of regional<br>order that's based on the notion of<br>overall cooperation among powers<br>and how this is changing around New<br>Zealand and for New Zealand<br>and as I think you'll see tonight David<br>is one of the people to help us look<br>forward across the regional geopolitical<br>landscape to think about what comes next<br>many congratulations on your<br>professorship I think we're all really<br>interested to hear what you have to say<br>tonight in your inaugural remarks could<br>everyone please help me welcome<br>uh wow uh thank you Jennifer Vice<br>Chancellor for those very kind uh that<br>kind introduction and for all of your<br>encouragement and support over the seven<br>and a half years that you've been here I<br>couldn't be happier to have you<br>introducing this talk as a vice<br>Chancellor uh tenakora uh Chancellor and<br>pro-chancellor thank you so much to<br>everybody for being here this evening uh<br>it's a real thrill and a genuine<br>pleasure to see so many friends and<br>colleagues in the audience and it's it's<br>very humbling experience and inaugural<br>lecture is a very special sort of<br>University tradition<br>um but it's a very challenging sort of<br>talk to give because you look out across<br>this in this beautiful chamber you look<br>out at this room and you see this these<br>multiple different audiences look out<br>and I see professional colleagues and<br>experts in the area that I'd like to<br>talk talk about this evening I also look<br>out and see some people who probably<br>feel that they're obliged to come along<br>just because they've happened to know me<br>for 30 years<br>and I also look out now and it's a sign<br>of just how old and tired I'm getting<br>that I look out and I see that alongside<br>those people who are who I've known for<br>30 years and who came along under some<br>sense of obligation are there children<br>who are here uh who are now adults<br>themselves and I probably hear under<br>even greater sense of obligation<br>in fact I saw one group of children in<br>the children in the audience who I<br>remember very fondly when they were<br>small used to uh tell people that my job<br>was a travel lawyer<br>uh and that was because I'd gone to law<br>school with their dad and all I seemed<br>to do they thought was travel<br>so whatever brought you here wherever<br>you were here thanks very much I'm very<br>grateful to you all for for coming along<br>and I also want to start by saying that<br>I'm very grateful uh to my mum and dad<br>uh that I'm very grateful that they are<br>both able to be to be here this evening<br>they were the people that first got me<br>interested in international politics uh<br>quizzing me sitting around the kitchen<br>table as a little boy asking me about<br>capitals of the world<br>uh and it's probably not very well known<br>that my dad was very sick and actually<br>in intensive care when I was waiting for<br>the news to see if I had been promoted<br>it was a difficult and stressful time<br>but the news when it came put a smile on<br>his face so thanks very much to the<br>professorial promotions committee for<br>Sally James and Kate none of this would<br>be possible without you thanks for<br>putting up for all the days that I've<br>been away the best Adventures uh the<br>ones we've been on together<br>and it's also uh wonderful to have a<br>chance to speak tonight in this very<br>special and wonderful place and as<br>Jennifer said in her opening remarks<br>this is a little bit of a homecoming or<br>just a little bit of circularity in my<br>story in the back in the 1980s I started<br>here at Victoria uh as an undergraduate<br>and I can tell you then that I would<br>never have imagined in my wildest dreams<br>that I would find myself giving a talk<br>like this tonight<br>to be honest I never imagined that I<br>would go on to graduate school or go on<br>to do a PhD or go on to have the chance<br>one day to come back and teach with some<br>of the people who had taught me<br>those possibilities only happen because<br>of the inspiring teachers I had the<br>likes of Rod alley<br>Stephen Levine Margaret Clark and the<br>late Ray Goldstein it was in their<br>classes with their encouragement that I<br>began to think about different ways of<br>trying to understand World politics and<br>here at Victoria I got also got an<br>education that made me able to imagine<br>different possibilities for my own life<br>now tonight my the title of my talk is<br>New Zealand and the end of the Asia<br>Pacific era and as you're here I roughly<br>date that era from the late 1980s and<br>this is what things look like in the<br>late 1980s<br>I have to say I'm not sure what on Earth<br>the Australian High Commissioner said to<br>me to do that to my hair but uh<br>as you can see from the bottom picture<br>it also just shows that good hair is<br>um<br>our roughly date this the Asian Pacific<br>era from the late 1980s until fairly<br>recently and I'm enormously fortunate<br>that my working life if I can call it<br>that I can hear some people cackle from<br>the from the from the uh cheap seats uh<br>has in in a number of ways evolved<br>alongside the development of the Asia<br>Pacific idea a huge number of the<br>opportunities that have come my way in<br>puzzles that I've been curious about<br>have come about because of asia-pacific<br>cooperation I've learned a huge amount<br>from colleagues in this room from<br>conversations with government officials<br>and perhaps most especially of all from<br>my students<br>but I think if someone had said to me in<br>1990 that the region in 2022 would be as<br>important to New Zealand as it is today<br>that it would look like it looks today<br>or that would be changing as it is today<br>then I think we would have struggled to<br>imagine that so my talk tonight is in<br>some ways a talk about the challenges of<br>strategic imagination<br>now I must say I'm denied a bit about<br>the title of this talk I have a bit of<br>trepidation about talking about the end<br>uh of the Asia Pacific era it all sounds<br>very definitive and these days frankly I<br>don't know about you but to me it feels<br>very hard to be definitive Definitive<br>about almost anything in international<br>politics When I Was An undergraduate<br>here the best-selling book was the end<br>of History by Francis fukuyama and<br>famously and confidently declared the<br>end of ideological conflict and the<br>Triumph of liberal democracy and of<br>course that didn't work out quite so<br>well and I've also lost track of the<br>number of books and articles that I've<br>come across called the end of War one of<br>them by John Horgan came out in 2014<br>just in time to go into paperback for<br>Vladimir Putin's first invasion of<br>Ukraine<br>so you might think international<br>relations would make me more cautious<br>about Reckless sweeping predictions that<br>can't be easily walked back but I'm<br>actually feeling pretty confident about<br>the claim I want to make this evening<br>I'm not very happy about it but I'm<br>pretty confident<br>now obviously the Asia Pacific or Asia<br>Pacific region has not ended or<br>disappeared it hasn't gone away it's not<br>as if countries have moved further apart<br>from one another or stopped interacting<br>although for a while during covert it<br>certainly felt a little bit like that<br>but the starting point for my talk is<br>that regions are not natural geographic<br>things they are collections of ideas and<br>practices the products of our Collective<br>imaginations regions are a bit like<br>scaled up versions of What Benedict<br>Anderson called imagine communities<br>now in the um in their talk their<br>discussion of the origins of security<br>cooperation in Europe and Asia<br>Christopher hammer and Peter katzenstein<br>give an example of this from the<br>discussions around the origins of the<br>Atlantic pact in 1948.<br>and when the U.S Senate began to debate<br>the Atlantic pact and debate an American<br>Security commitment to Europe uh<br>Senator Henry Cabot Lodge was puzzled<br>when his colleagues began to refer to<br>the relationship between the United<br>States and Europe as a or between the<br>United States and North America as a<br>regional one<br>surely it can't be a region he said what<br>kind of region is that of course it can<br>replied Senator Arthur Vandenberg we<br>share the same North Atlantic region and<br>this sparked a debate between the<br>Senators about how far this concept of<br>region could be stretched did three<br>thousand miles of ocean make any talk of<br>a common region absurd could a region be<br>anything a state wanted it to be what<br>made up a region Beyond some notion of<br>geographic proximity<br>and this debate sort of reminds us that<br>the fact that regions don't just exist<br>as material objects in the world as<br>hammer and katzenstein argue geography<br>is not Destiny instead regions are<br>social and cognitive constructs that can<br>strike actors as more or less plausible<br>and we could make exactly the argument<br>about the Asia Pacific and age of Asia<br>Pacific region and about an asia-pacific<br>order<br>however much this idea of the Asia<br>Pacific now feels like a familiar part<br>of our lexicon and a familiar part of<br>the way that we think and talk about our<br>part of the world it is of course<br>profoundly artificial if we look at the<br>membership of Apec for example does it<br>make sense that Russia and Peru are part<br>of the same region or Canada and Brunei<br>are part of the same asia-pacific<br>regions<br>so regions are more than natural just<br>natural things they are mental maps and<br>Canadian Professor Paul Evans says what<br>he calls the frame of the Asia Pacific<br>was invented in the mid-1980s uh largely<br>as a way of capturing the trans-pacific<br>interest and the growing markets of Asia<br>and trying to find a way to create some<br>sense of community or commonality as an<br>overlay over economic transactions<br>now tonight I'm going to argue there<br>were three aspects to the Asia Pacific<br>era<br>first was an economic Dimension the Asia<br>Pacific was forged not by governments or<br>militaries but by firms and businesses<br>pursuing the advantages of globalization<br>from the 1980s onwards an outflow of<br>capital from Japan and the United States<br>spurred the rapid industrialization of<br>developing East Asia this was a period<br>of remarkable regionalization where<br>production networks within and between<br>firms spread this was region building<br>from the bottom up driven by a desire to<br>improve efficiency reduced costs and<br>make money and when new government<br>groupings like apic came along initially<br>at least they were playing catch-up with<br>business<br>liberalization was the spirit of the<br>times trade barriers became began to<br>fall down average tariffs in the region<br>fell by a third between 1995 and 2000.<br>Grand dreams began to be dreamed Apec<br>itself set itself the vision of a free<br>trade area and investment Zone across<br>the whole Asia Pacific by 2020. now to<br>be clear none of this was inevitable and<br>none of it was linear there were zigs<br>and zags most notably the Asian<br>financial crisis of the late 1990s which<br>posed huge questions about the role of<br>the United States and the international<br>financial institutions in Asia's future<br>there were still plenty of<br>protectionists out there there were<br>efforts like Malaysian prime minister<br>mahathir's efforts to create an East<br>Asian economic group that would exclude<br>Australia New Zealand and the United<br>States but these efforts failed and<br>overall this was a the story of a<br>trans-pacific economic region coming<br>together<br>and that takes us to the second part of<br>the Asia Pacific order it's security<br>dimension the asia-pacific era emerged<br>at the end of the Cold War and<br>flourished in what we can now look back<br>on as a remarkable unipolar moment its<br>main feature was the U.S American<br>predominant predominance of power in<br>which in Asia manifest itself in its<br>hubs and spokes Alliance System now<br>although there was a debate at the end<br>of the Cold War about the U.S<br>withdrawing from the region those<br>alliances remain pivotal remain Central<br>to Regional Security today they also<br>evolved the US Australia Alliance for<br>example in the early 2000s began to be<br>framed much more about contributing to<br>U.S Global Security goals fighting<br>terrorism and providing public goods<br>like humanitarian assistance and<br>disaster relief<br>but under U.S preeminence there was also<br>a space for other ideas even if<br>sometimes they were aspirational<br>some of these initially emerged from the<br>European context and were a poor fit for<br>the different strategic circumstances of<br>East Asia and as Scholars like Amit<br>avacharya and Brian Jobe have written it<br>took the work of Asia's track two<br>networks academics and think tankers to<br>translate or localize them into Concepts<br>and initiatives where they resonated in<br>Asia one was the idea of Cooperative<br>security that took hold among Southeast<br>Asian thinkers in the 1990s this was the<br>idea that countries would seek to build<br>security with one another rather than<br>one another's expense it was gradualist<br>it believes in habits of cooperation and<br>dialogue and again to be clear these<br>were never adopted in a way that<br>transformed the most fundamental<br>national interests but they did provide<br>space for the development of cooperation<br>and diplomacy defense diplomacy on a<br>sit-rich series of issues<br>another key idea was the principle of<br>Engagement that underpinned U.S China<br>relations and when Paul Evans and I<br>wrote a book on the the language of<br>regional Security in the Asia Pacific we<br>were struck by the the sheer number of<br>these terms for engagement conditional<br>engagement constructive engagement<br>partial engagement Hawk engagement what<br>they all had in common was this idea<br>that in dealing with a rising power like<br>China required finding ways to<br>accommodate its interests within the<br>existing order the Hope was that through<br>engagement through carrots and sticks it<br>would buy into a key the key<br>understandings of the regional order<br>and it's sort of hard to remember in<br>these much more confrontational times<br>but that engage that era of Engagement<br>went on for a lot longer than I think we<br>like to we we tend to remember these<br>days and just to give you one example<br>the the first invitation to the people<br>Liberation Navy people's Liberation Army<br>Navy China's Navy to take part in the<br>biggest U.S military exercise uh in the<br>Pacific came in 2014.<br>now finally the third part of this Asia<br>Pacific ERA this Asia Pacific order and<br>one that was especially valuable for New<br>Zealand was its diplomatic component<br>and looking back it's hard to believe<br>that in the early 1990s<br>Asia was described by one leading<br>scholar as being ripe for rivalry and<br>prone to conflict because it lacked<br>sufficient multilateral institutions<br>what we saw from the 1990s onwards was a<br>remarkable period of institution<br>building and more than that inclusive<br>institution building<br>there are a number of special features<br>of Asia's regionalism they will not<br>create these organizations were not<br>created by the big Powers instead they<br>were founded around the smaller and<br>weaker powers of the association of<br>Southeast Asian Nations or asean they<br>differed from their European<br>counterparts by virtue of being based on<br>Norms of consensus informality building<br>habits of cooperation putting issues<br>aside when things got too difficult<br>and the Mantra that grew up around these<br>groups was the claim of asean centrality<br>that asean was in the driver's seat that<br>the weakest States in Asia were the<br>focus for cooperation<br>and the creation of the asean regional<br>Forum in 1994 was seen as a key way to<br>engage China which at the time was very<br>wary about containment strategies in<br>Disguise the US U.S was also very<br>skeptical about these new groupings<br>calling proposals Solutions in search of<br>a problem but it eventually began to see<br>them as useful as well the growth<br>continued Prime Ministers and presidents<br>started meeting at the East Asia Summit<br>in 2005. in 2011 defense ministers were<br>the final part of the puzzle when they<br>met in the defense ministers process<br>now some have read it rather grandly<br>called this a regional security<br>architecture<br>and I have to say if it was architecture<br>I think it is more hondavasa's toilet<br>than it is Frank Lloyd Wright's falling<br>water I think you have to do pretty I<br>don't think too many Architects uh would<br>be uh would be rushing to sign up to<br>claim this is a very impressive tidy<br>piece of work but there was certainly a<br>structure to it and a tempo of regular<br>meetings and for the most most<br>enthusiastic these were sites where<br>processes of socialization could occur<br>where new Norms could emerge for others<br>they were at least places where<br>officials could talk could share their<br>fears and Ambitions and in theory to<br>work to forge a better region<br>now together I argue these three<br>elements Economic Security and<br>diplomatic made up in Asia Pacific order<br>not one that sits easily in any one<br>basket of international Theory there's a<br>mix of realist alliances as well as<br>liberal economic interdependence and<br>inclusive institutions<br>and that's not even to acknowledge the<br>changes that took place inside States as<br>uh the era of State making came to an<br>end and most of the post-colonial<br>boundaries in in Asia were accepted now<br>this was not an uncontested area let's<br>be clear about that the commitment to<br>economic liberalization really lived up<br>to the rhetoric domestic politics<br>frequently Trump trumped uh no pun<br>intended Regional declarations China<br>constantly bemoaned the Cold War<br>mentality of U.S alliances and<br>engagement as a strategy within the US<br>itself had plenty of critics<br>there were efforts to challenge asean<br>centrality<br>I mean one of the most memorable was uh<br>Kevin Rudd's idea for a new Regional<br>Summit called the Asia Pacific Community<br>which Mr Rudd announced before talking<br>to anyone else in the region about it<br>and this at least provided an<br>opportunity for some of us to go to<br>Sydney to watch Australians being<br>shouted at by singaporeans<br>there were these challenges but they<br>didn't prevail<br>and this brings me to my second major<br>argument and this was an order an era<br>that was incredibly kind to New Zealand<br>New Zealand found itself on the edge of<br>the most dynamic part of the global<br>economy pursuing an Asia First Trade<br>policy from 1993 onwards it saw<br>plurilateral and and other free Regional<br>free trade agreements to work around the<br>lack of consensus in the Gat and the WTO<br>we saw the proliferation of those trade<br>agreements and we know so many of on<br>that list and as Ian mcgibbon details in<br>his excellent new history of of the<br>foreign Ministry New Zealand excelled in<br>the business of trade negotiations<br>in terms of security New Zealand enjoyed<br>the shelter provided by U.S predominance<br>and the fact that our large and only<br>Ally lay between us and some of the<br>challenges of the region as it changed<br>and that meant that in March 2001 Helen<br>Clark could tell a conference here in<br>Wellington that quote we count ourselves<br>very lucky to live in one of the most<br>strategically secure environments in the<br>world going on to say that this was the<br>context in which her government was able<br>to Champion disarmament objectives<br>New Zealand was able to use Cooperative<br>security approaches to push for progress<br>in Asia on non-traditional issues for<br>example transnational crime Maritime<br>security counter-terrorism disaster<br>reduction in peacekeeping and it was<br>this sort of time that took me down a<br>slightly unexpected pathway of research<br>into arms research on arms trafficking<br>in Asia and the Pacific and I have to<br>say I enjoyed the work found it very<br>interesting but it must be said that<br>when the arrival of magazines like guns<br>and ammo and Jane's infantry weapons<br>started to arrive through the letterbox<br>it did briefly strain my marriage<br>somewhat<br>uh and when it came to those diplomatic<br>groupings we New Zealand was what one<br>official called a compulsive Joiner<br>we were quick to seek membership in all<br>of the wider asean groupings in his<br>account of asean New Zealand relations<br>Malcolm McKinnon argues that for New<br>Zealand the transformation of the the<br>formation of the asean regional Forum<br>was a key moment in transforming its<br>relationship with asean from a focus on<br>southeast Asia into a wider Regional One<br>when the opportunity came to join the<br>East Asia Summit with Australia in India<br>Helen Clark jumped at the chance we<br>looked and led at opportunities in the<br>defense Minister's space and we even<br>signed up to something called the Asia<br>Europe meeting or asem a sprawling<br>trans-regional gab Fest that quickly<br>revealed itself as unable to do very<br>much now to be fair New Zealand only<br>signed up pushed to join when Australia<br>announced it wanted in better to be on<br>the inside looking out than stuck out in<br>the cold<br>and in 1993 the New Zealand government<br>decided to create a new center to<br>support that engagement with the<br>emerging Asian multilateralism the<br>center for security the center for<br>strategic studies was headed up by<br>Terence O'Brien and its first staff<br>member co-opted from a very brief spell<br>outside the safety of the University was<br>One D Cappy<br>I was quickly back to graduate study<br>where I was uh the sheltered workshop of<br>the University<br>even as others grew more skeptical about<br>Regional architecture New Zealand always<br>seemed to be a True Believer uh it<br>seemed to sort of set something deep<br>down in our DNA that if you could<br>dialogue enough if you were Corrido<br>enough you can find a compromise and a<br>solution and it was really interesting<br>to me that just over 18 months ago<br>foreign minister mahuta when she was<br>asked if there were prospects for<br>mediating between the U.S and China she<br>said I think hosting Apec might well be<br>the opportunity but both parties will<br>have to be willing to come together and<br>concede in some areas where they're<br>currently not seeing eye to eye<br>so why then do I uh argue that this era<br>has come to an end first in terms of<br>Econo in in the economic Dimension there<br>are good reasons to think that the high<br>water mark of the globalizing revolution<br>has come and gone<br>trade as a percentage of global GDP has<br>declined in the last few years even<br>prior to the disruptions of covert and<br>the war in Ukraine protectionism is on<br>the rise<br>the United States has taken a<br>dramatically sharp turn on trade policy<br>president Trump famously walked away<br>from the trans-pacific partnership but<br>President Biden's trade policy for the<br>middle class doesn't look very different<br>the US's New Economic strategy for re<br>for the region the so-called<br>indo-pacific economic framework doesn't<br>see as part of the exchange any improved<br>Market access to the United States<br>there's no political constituency in the<br>US today that's arguing in favor of<br>these big multilateral trade deals New<br>Economic connections are grounded<br>increasingly in relationships of trust<br>and geopolitical Alignment not economic<br>efficiency<br>and it's not just the US that has turned<br>more inwards China's doing the same<br>through its new idea of dual circulation<br>economic model and its zero covert<br>strategy<br>that shift has probably been given<br>additional Spurs as China reacts to what<br>it sees as the risks in interdependence<br>in the Global Financial system following<br>the imposition of sanctions on Russia<br>following its invasion of Ukraine India<br>has also turned inwards with prime<br>minister modi's call for greater<br>self-reliance so rather than a language<br>of closer integration we now hear about<br>decoupling rather than trade<br>underpinning peace some of the fiercest<br>competition has been in the areas of<br>trade and Technology trade has been used<br>as a blunt instrument of coercion in an<br>era of strategic competition war and<br>pandemics those long Supply chains cry<br>out vulnerability<br>secondly though it's in the dimension of<br>security where the biggest changes have<br>happened and China's power has grown in<br>a way that would have been hard to<br>imagine even for the most far-sighted<br>Observer 30 years ago<br>China now has the largest Navy in the<br>world and an estimated 355 vessels<br>compared to the US's 296 and it's<br>building more everybody has a China<br>factoid they like to wheel out at<br>cocktail parties or perhaps that's maybe<br>a sad reflection on the cocktail parties<br>I'm going to<br>um but here's one between 2014 and 2018<br>China launched more submarines warships<br>amphibious vessels and auxiliaries than<br>the number of ships currently serving in<br>the Navies of Germany India Spain and<br>the UK<br>a German Admiral noted in 2021 that<br>China's Navy is expanding roughly the<br>equivalent of the entire French navy<br>every four years<br>it's investing enormous amounts in<br>Advanced Technologies and its defense<br>budget remains smaller than that of the<br>United States its military remains<br>untested at as few formal allies but<br>China has a big advantage in our region<br>it's playing on home turf and so the<br>military balance of power in the region<br>has shifted fundamentally that itself<br>would have been a challenge but China's<br>Behavior has also changed China's charm<br>offensive in southeast southeast Asia<br>ended more than a decade ago its actions<br>in South in the South China Sea in the<br>East China Sea on its Regional border<br>with India collectively suggests a state<br>that wants to change the regional status<br>quo<br>the result is that power politics and<br>hard balancing are back last May the<br>White House is indo-pacific leader Kurt<br>Campbell put it clearly when he said<br>quote the period that was broadly<br>described as engagement has come to an<br>end and both the United States and China<br>now frequently talk about each other as<br>adversaries if not as enemies and when<br>it comes to the return of power politics<br>it's not just about the United States<br>and China Japan has talked about<br>increasing its defense defense spending<br>to about two percent of GDP which will<br>make it the third largest defense budget<br>in the world under its strategic update<br>2020 Australia planned to spend an<br>astonishing 270 billion dollars in new<br>spending on top of our already large<br>defense budget over the next decade<br>and the third area where I think the<br>Asia Pacific area is coming to an end is<br>perhaps maybe this is the more debatable<br>one and that is that the Cooperative<br>Arrangements that have emerged over the<br>last 25 years are struggling to cope<br>with the pressures of much sharper uh<br>great power relations asean is today<br>stressed by internal struggles like<br>Myanmar and extra Regional pressures and<br>even in softer areas where it can<br>actually talk about issues it's hard to<br>turn commitments on paper uh into action<br>on the ground now these criticisms are<br>not new and it's not as if New Zealand<br>officials aren't aware of the<br>limitations of some of these<br>arrangements and I'm not saying that<br>these processes have no value especially<br>for a small country but I think what's<br>different this time is that we are<br>seeing the rise of alternative<br>Frameworks of cooperation and the most<br>important of these are the quadrilateral<br>security dialogue or quad that brings<br>together Australia India Japan and the<br>United States another is Orcas the<br>relationship between Australia the UK<br>and the US launched last September but<br>there's also a host of other trilateral<br>arrangements as well and these mini<br>lateral arrangements as they're<br>sometimes called are not new<br>but the intensity of strategic<br>competition that's going on has led U.S<br>allies and partners to invest more in<br>these mini laterals than in the larger<br>inclusive Frameworks<br>and President Biden just in the last day<br>or so has announced that he won't be<br>going to the Apex Summit in Thailand<br>this year<br>but just as a point of contrast the four<br>quad leaders have met twice in person<br>and once virtually in the last 12 months<br>uh and it's not just the U.S and its<br>allies that are creating new<br>institutions China has been doing the<br>same for example in the example in the<br>Mekong it's been deepening its<br>connections through the Shanghai<br>cooperation uh organization and these<br>raise uh questions about the performance<br>uh and adequacy of the existing<br>Cooperative Frameworks and perhaps these<br>many lateral Frameworks didn't matter so<br>much when they were just tackling these<br>harder security issues but as they start<br>to take on more and more issues climate<br>change emerging technology artificial<br>intelligence<br>humanitarian assistance assistance and<br>disaster relief the costs of not being<br>in the room the costs of not engaging<br>with those groups becomes higher and<br>higher as new rules and new standards<br>are being set we still hear the<br>invocation of asean centrality we hear<br>it over and over but I would argue that<br>unfortunately very few of those who<br>profess it profess to support it really<br>believe it it's not going to end<br>tomorrow but I do think it's going to be<br>less important uh in substantive terms<br>so across all these Dimensions Economic<br>Security diplomatic a period of relative<br>stability and predictability has come to<br>an end and collectively I think that<br>marks the end of the asia-pacific era<br>now if I'm right it obviously begs the<br>question what's next<br>now one answer might be that the Asia<br>Pacific era has given way to the<br>indo-pacific<br>certainly the language of the<br>indo-pacific is all around us Australia<br>has used the term in its foreign defense<br>policy since at least 2013 former prime<br>minister Japanese prime minister Abe<br>talked about a vision of free and open<br>indo-pacific terminology that was picked<br>up by the United States the U.S even<br>renamed its Pacific command indo-pacific<br>command in 2018 even though it continued<br>to cover precisely the same area of the<br>world as it had before the EU has joined<br>The Fray the Netherlands has an<br>indo-pacific strategy France does as<br>well<br>uh and just about a year ago prime<br>minister ardern put New Zealand's stamp<br>on the indo-pacific just down the road<br>from here uh in a speech where she laid<br>out not a strategy not a policy but a<br>series of principles that New Zealand<br>believes in uh in guiding its approach<br>to indo-pacific principles like the<br>importance of sovereignty Transparency<br>International law<br>but also and and she was clear to stress<br>this the importance of inclusivity and<br>not drawing frames that pushed some out<br>of the region<br>so what can we say about the origins of<br>the indo-pacific my colleague manjit<br>padisi has written that it's actually<br>nothing new that really we're returning<br>to the indo-pacific idea that a single<br>strategic region connecting the Indian<br>Ocean and the Pacific Ocean has been the<br>norm except for a short period during<br>the since the 1960s<br>one thing is for sure if the Asia<br>Pacific was created by business the<br>indo-pacific is being driven by<br>geopolitics<br>but if this Frame seems to be spreading<br>if the language seems to be catching on<br>I'd argue the economic the military the<br>institutional content of this new order<br>is still far from Clear<br>and if we look at the way that Asia has<br>responded to the war in Ukraine it<br>should perhaps remind us that we're<br>unlikely to see neat alignments emerging<br>that rather we're going to see big<br>players calculating and pursuing their<br>interests sometimes these will align<br>sometimes they won't whatever we think<br>of China and beijing's behavior under Xi<br>Jinping it will remain a vital economic<br>partner for many and a vitally a an<br>influential political actor and there<br>are plenty of countries in our part of<br>the world that even if they Harbor<br>concerns about beijing's policies will<br>be reluctant to sign up to Frameworks<br>that exclude it<br>what I think we're likely to see<br>unfortunately is something Messier much<br>less predictable much more dangerous<br>than we've enjoyed for the last 30 years<br>and in a recent article the Indian<br>scholar and former National Security<br>adviser shinshanka Menon says uh he says<br>we live in an ERA with a world of<br>revisionist powers no one likes the<br>current world order he says no single<br>power can dictate the terms of the<br>current order and the major powers do<br>not subscribe to a clear set of<br>principles and Norms it's hard to<br>establish the rules of the road when so<br>many countries are on their own paths<br>in the words of the great Italian<br>Marxist thinker Antonio gramshi the old<br>order is dying and the New Order cannot<br>be born<br>so we need to prepare for challenging<br>times ahead a region that is more<br>conflictual less open and without the<br>comfort of multilateral Institutions<br>that sounds like a fairly Bleak picture<br>and Sally said to me make sure you try<br>and finish on a slightly upbeat note<br>perhaps it also presents some<br>opportunities for small and middle<br>powers to imagine and to try and reshape<br>the emerging order and I appreciate this<br>has got a bit of a sort of a apart from<br>that Mrs Lincoln how did you enjoy the<br>England was hugely skillful at<br>innovating on the economics and trade<br>front during the Asia Pacific era<br>can we do something the same in a modest<br>way for this new in geopolitics for the<br>new era that's coming next<br>this might take us into some<br>uncomfortable territory<br>power is a bit of a dirty word in the<br>New Zealand lexicon you will search all<br>of our defense statements in vain for<br>any reference to our own power we only<br>ever talk about other people's power<br>certainly the government seems most<br>comfortable in framing its foreign<br>policy Ventures as trade missions<br>we could ask some questions about<br>whether or not we're putting sufficient<br>resourcing into our diplomacy and our<br>defense we could ask hard questions<br>about the sort of relationships we might<br>want to have with orcas or the quad<br>these new exclusive Frameworks<br>but perhaps there are also some signs<br>that we're seeing small states are<br>already able in modest ways to shape the<br>behavior of big powers in the way that<br>in ways that are emerging and I'm<br>thinking here of the new us-led partners<br>uh for the Blue Pacific and if we think<br>about the way that it has approached the<br>challenge of strategic competition in<br>the South Pacific it has done so by<br>focusing on the priorities and concerns<br>of Pacific island States it's learned<br>that it's better to talk about climate<br>change development and opportunities<br>than China China<br>now a pivot from trade to Security in<br>the way that New Zealand thinks about<br>its priorities might not be easy and it<br>won't be welcomed by all but perhaps it<br>is what the times require and indeed it<br>might be coming sooner than we think uh<br>and I stumbled on an oia the other day a<br>few people suddenly go uh oh in the room<br>an oia that was released to a website<br>I didn't request it I can say of a<br>briefing before the Shangri-La dialogue<br>in Singapore to minister Pina Henry<br>defense minister it was only popped up<br>on the web about 10 days ago I just<br>stumbled across it and had a whole<br>section on the indo-pacific comment<br>indo-pacific concept<br>and this was the advice that was in that<br>briefing<br>it said in 2022 the term Asia Pacific no<br>longer captures adequately the full span<br>of New Zealand's interests economic and<br>strategic Partnerships it has become<br>increasingly seen as an economic<br>construct promoting regional trade and<br>economic integration how times have<br>changed<br>so finally if I can return to where I<br>started I'd say in closing as we think<br>about this new terrain that we're<br>encountering there's a vital role for<br>universities and I hope a vital role for<br>Victoria University of Wellington<br>whatever emerges to replace the<br>predictability the relative<br>predictability of the Asia Pacific era<br>we need to be able to try and make sense<br>of it through a New Zealand lens as<br>China India Indonesia and others become<br>much bigger players in our region and<br>our world in the years ahead we need the<br>expertise in languages and cultures in<br>government in society in history in<br>economies to help us understand how<br>others see the world and see the region<br>changing around us and if we don't have<br>our own experts we'll find ourselves<br>relying on the assessments of others and<br>however like-minded they might be<br>they will not always have the same<br>priorities and interests that we do so I<br>think it's vital that we continue to<br>invest in these areas in our<br>universities and encourage the next<br>generation of researchers to come<br>through<br>and in an era of in which there will be<br>few certainties I think it's also<br>essential that we're able to think for<br>ourselves to question to critique and to<br>debate and I'd like to think that that<br>is one of the things that universities<br>are very good at doing and I hope<br>Victoria can continue to be part of the<br>conversations here in Wellington as we<br>imagine about how best to secure New<br>Zealand's interests and how a better<br>Regional order can be built in the years<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>good evening and welcome<br>my name is Diana Burton I am the acting<br>dean of the human faculty of humanities<br>and social sciences and before we all<br>let David loose and give him a drink<br>it is my very great pleasure to offer<br>the vote of thanks<br>Felix kipoto at rare on konoscure causes<br>happy the Roman poet Virgil tells us<br>it's the individual who is capable of<br>understanding the causes of things<br>this evening after such a penetrating<br>lecture as we have just heard we are<br>each of us able and happier than we were<br>before<br>or perhaps not happier David has shown<br>clearly how our construction of the Asia<br>Pacific region is a mostly beneficial or<br>if not or at least benign space in which<br>we could benefit in terms of security<br>trade the economy and foreign policy can<br>no longer stand at least not in the same<br>times change and whether we like it or<br>not our posture in the region and the<br>world changes with them David makes it<br>clear how we're in danger of being left<br>out if we remain complacent or lazy if<br>we seek to remain if we seek to retain<br>our place at the table if we want to<br>thrive as an independent society and<br>surely we do we will need to rethink our<br>thinking quite radically<br>in some ways this means reassessing and<br>reforming the the basic the boxes sorry<br>that we invented for ourselves in others<br>it means embracing the intellectual<br>values of the University languages<br>cultural studies and Global thinking<br>could be crucial to our regional success<br>however we denominate it or Define it<br>it's fortunate then perhaps even a<br>prompt to happiness that we have Minds<br>like David's to help us formulate our<br>Fresh Approach indeed it's a source of<br>pleasure when we have an opportunity to<br>appreciate how our colleagues and our<br>friends are not merely imminent but<br>deservedly imminent because they're<br>smart<br>this lecture has drawn on a remarkably<br>varied range of material not everyone<br>can fold together economic ideas<br>competing National Trade Practices the<br>fabric of international diplomacy and<br>geopolitical realities and make<br>something meaningful out of all of it<br>most of us are familiar if even if only<br>superficially with the bits and pieces<br>of David's lecture but rendering such<br>disparate kinds of information and<br>scholarship into a picture so clear and<br>coherent is a rare ability and to do the<br>job with ease and elegance excites let's<br>not say Envy but certainly admiration I<br>was fascinated in hearing David first<br>analyze our current political situation<br>and then fit the parts together in a way<br>that casts new light on the whole and<br>makes us all reconsider what we thought<br>we already knew this is a talk that's<br>much greater than the sum of its parts<br>for which we are all very grateful thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
