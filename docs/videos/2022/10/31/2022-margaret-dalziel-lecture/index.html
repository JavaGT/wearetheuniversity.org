The 2022 Margaret Dalziel Lecture uses the emerging subfield of "Critical AI" as a frame for thinking through literary and artistic engagements with machine learning, particularly in the domain of natural language generation, that both reflect and respond to our new sociotechnical condition.

Margaret tells you a lecture but<br>you know that story all too well uh this<br>year I would also like to acknowledge<br>the support of the School of Arts the<br>division of the humanities for<br>supporting the event in<br>um spirit and material terms the<br>australasian association for the digital<br>Humanities I think some of you<br>are probably watching at the moment<br>shout out to you Ada the aotearo Digital<br>Arts Network the University of<br>Canterbury their English Department and<br>the DH program there too University of<br>otago computer science AI group uh<br>welcome<br>uh and our co-sponsor the center for<br>artificial intelligence and public<br>policy uh and the way this works is that<br>they will get the first right of<br>response uh to our speaker when we're<br>done Professor James McLaren then I'll<br>quit<br>also one admin item we've tried to<br>incorporate<br>a live q a element for the people who<br>are remote so if you're listening out<br>there<br>and you email English at<br>otago.ac.nz you'll see a zoom link pop<br>up and you can contribute to the Q a uh<br>Alexander Richie is kind enough to be<br>looking after that so we'll put that<br>email address back up toward the end of<br>the session as well so the lecture was<br>established in 1981 to honor Professor<br>Margaret talziel first female provice<br>Chancellor a long time head of English<br>Department and its first female<br>professor<br>rangiora born Oxford educated she was<br>both teacher and mentor to many of<br>altero's literary community<br>this lecture is a beacon of tradition<br>for our department we have the honor of<br>inviting a scholar at the top of their<br>game someone who has had a<br>transformative impact on their field<br>but this year we're putting a somewhat<br>less conventional spin on it and that's<br>because Professor Rita rally is not a<br>conventional literary studies scholar<br>nor is she from any one past tradition<br>in fact<br>she's from the future<br>let me explain I wrote my PhD with Rita<br>Railey but she did not know that at the<br>time and how could she she was already<br>in the future<br>she had by that time landed one of the<br>first jobs in what was then<br>just starting to be called the digital<br>humanities<br>a job that called for applicants with<br>and I quote a major commitment to<br>studying the historical and theoretical<br>aspects of Information Technology and<br>New Media<br>applicants who would<br>teach courses on such subjects as the<br>culture and Aesthetics of information<br>hypertext literature and the<br>relationship between Information Society<br>and gender ethnicity or Global cultures<br>so meanwhile I was getting talked out of<br>writing a PhD about James Joyce's<br>Ulysses by my supervisor he suggested I<br>try something new so I was talking<br>myself into writing on well something<br>new digital literature what was then<br>called hypertext<br>in hindsight I would have combined the<br>two I'm still obviously<br>not exactly sure how I feel about all of<br>this so anyway I needed to tap into the<br>scholarship that was up to date up with<br>the play on this new transformational<br>literary media and that's when I came<br>across Rita's work<br>but Rita wasn't simply up to date she<br>was always one step ahead always<br>sensitive to the ways in which in her<br>own words computational techniques and<br>methods affect the literary imagination<br>just as they shape our organizational<br>structures<br>her work eventually moved from the<br>reference list of my dissertation to the<br>pages of my course outlines as I began<br>my teaching life<br>and anytime I needed help situating my<br>students experiences of struggling of<br>coming to terms with new writing<br>Technologies and all the trappings They<br>entail I would just look to the Future<br>and there was Rita<br>saying something about digital<br>technology digital textuality and its<br>feedback economy where an input and<br>output are linked in a way that is<br>material performative and generative<br>in the digital Humanities specifically<br>she's reminded us that quote perhaps<br>more than any other professional<br>communities<br>digital humanists need to continually<br>work to perceive and negotiate the<br>institutional imaginary of Information<br>Technology so as not to fall into the<br>Trap<br>of unconsciously adopting its optics for<br>example Innovation that happens to be<br>it's no exaggeration to say she's also a<br>good part of the reason why digital<br>Humanities at otago has critical<br>feminist and Indigenous principles baked<br>in from the start her contribution to<br>the debates on the darker side of the<br>digital Humanities were formative for<br>our own scholar Librarians in putting<br>together their own DH Workshop program<br>and also to their own teaching into our<br>University's first DH paper on the topic<br>of indigenous data sovereignty<br>to Alexander Richie and Kate Knox on<br>that count it was a wonderful session<br>professor of English at University of<br>California Santa Barbara Rita's work is<br>situated at the intersection of digital<br>media and humanistic inquiry with an<br>emphasis on language literature politics<br>and art practice she's taught at the<br>University of Minnesota Rice University<br>and NYU<br>and she has helped Fellowship<br>appointments at the National Humanities<br>Center in the U.S UCLA the Dutch<br>foundation for literature and the<br>University of Bergen in Norway<br>her 2009 book tactical media was among<br>the first to comprehensively link<br>networks and activism<br>in light of digital culture it showed<br>how aesthetic practices examine and<br>respond to<br>post-industrial society<br>and neoliberalist globalization<br>she has delivered 70 invited talks soon<br>to be 71.<br>and over 10 Keynotes addresses and this<br>goes all the way back to a creative<br>writing seminar<br>using hypertext in 1999.<br>but by now I hope it's really clear that<br>being from the future<br>refers not to a purely technological<br>realm that's just beyond the borders of<br>our imagination rather it refers to an<br>aspirational mode<br>of critical reflective humanistic<br>inquiry that always attends to the socio<br>complexity or<br>socio-technical experience that we have<br>this afternoon Rita is going to speak on<br>critical AI as a frame for thinking<br>through literary and artistic<br>please join me in welcoming Professor<br>it's hard to find it's hard to follow<br>that that was an amazing introduction<br>thank you so much how is the Acoustics<br>do I need to be good yeah<br>um thanks to all of you for coming out<br>this afternoon and thanks especially of<br>course today for spearheading this event<br>and for his amazing Hospitality I<br>understand that we heard today that I'm<br>the first International scholar in the<br>pre or post-covet era to the extent that<br>this is post-covered and this is also my<br>first travel since covid so I am<br>especially delighted to be here<br>um it's too much to say that I'm happy<br>for the delay or the deferral but I do<br>think I appreciate more now the<br>opportunity to be here with you than I<br>might have appreciated even in 2020 so<br>thank you again<br>I also have to acknowledge Margaret<br>dalziel who is clearly a remarkable<br>figure and to tell you how grateful and<br>honored I am to have been invited to<br>help commemorate her Legacy<br>so Dave has been very generous and<br>comprehensive with his introduction but<br>I'm going to amplify just a little bit<br>at the outset with mention of the three<br>areas that organize my work the first<br>electronic literature language art code<br>Poetics are all ways to describe<br>expressive uses of computational media<br>and in some ways they're captured in the<br>Fantastic digital Humanities lab that is<br>in the English Department and I was<br>fortunate enough to see afternoon<br>the second area is tactical<br>interventionist and resistant media<br>practices out of which emerges my<br>interest in accessible machine learning<br>which I'm going to talk to you about<br>today<br>and not at all unrelated my third area<br>of emphasis we might call language<br>politics<br>and wish over this is meant over time my<br>thinking about global English as both an<br>historical and cultural condition and<br>more specifically as an informing and<br>legitimating idea for mid-20th Century<br>machine translation<br>so from from an earlier focus on<br>grammatical and statistical paradigms<br>for machine translation I've more<br>recently moved to thinking about the use<br>of neural networks and so terms zero<br>shot techniques which is to say with a<br>fuller engagement with the field of<br>natural language processing or NLP and<br>an exploration of what language actually<br>means in this domain what the relation<br>as well might be to so term human<br>language in its socio-cultural economic<br>and material forms<br>so one of my ongoing projects then at<br>the moment concerns language and its new<br>Technical and instrumentalist guys<br>against the backdrop of actual practices<br>with machinic language not just machine<br>translation but autocomplete and smart<br>reply features search engine<br>optimization and again NLP I'm<br>considering the post alphabetic like<br>Global English as a condition that's<br>constituted by the supposition that<br>we've transcended the order of natural<br>languages the supposition in other words<br>that digital media from binary code to<br>high level processing languages has not<br>just surpassed but threatens to Eclipse<br>communicative forms we have historically<br>understood to be properly human<br>so this media history thus accounts for<br>the translation of language and some<br>numerical representation it's<br>operationalizing and algorithmic<br>management and the discourse on its<br>impoverishment by capital<br>the premise of my research is that to<br>come to terms with our contemporary<br>techno-linguistic condition we have to<br>try to understand to some degree the<br>technology<br>and I just want to mention<br>um is Dave's description of my<br>introduction he gave me a little bit of<br>a preview and he told me he was going to<br>go back to the moment of my hire so I<br>was inspired to go back to my slide deck<br>from my job talk at the time and I'm<br>actually struck by how I guess<br>consistent I have been so in 2001 I was<br>making an argument for humanities to<br>engage with what at the time we were<br>thinking about his code and there's a<br>way in which this type of advocacy<br>argument is still at the core of what<br>I'm thinking about now<br>so throughout the Arc of my career to<br>date and I do have to kind of imagine<br>that I'm only at the Midway Point<br>um I've been interested in making<br>literacy arguments but also interested<br>in thinking about how fields of study<br>are constituted<br>how academic disciplines come to be how<br>they Define their mission and how<br>Concepts and methods Mark institutional<br>Terrain<br>so where I began with the history of<br>English studies as a discipline is in<br>some ways where I've landed but the<br>questions look very different now<br>if then I was interested in the means by<br>which modern literary study becomes a<br>professional Enterprise the purposes it<br>was meant to serve and the narratives<br>that legitimated it entangled of course<br>with the colonial projects of Britain<br>and the U.S<br>I now find myself thinking about how we<br>might reconceive or reimagine the work<br>of English departments particularly in<br>light of all of the developments in our<br>reading and writing practices and all of<br>the external economic social and<br>technological pressures on book<br>disciplines those for which the book has<br>been both objective study and research<br>product<br>So to that end I'm born recently<br>thinking about the inscriptive as an art<br>and Writing Practice that constitutes<br>and organizes a field of contemporary<br>cultural production and I just want to<br>mention a special issue of the Journal<br>called ASAP which is the association for<br>the study of Arts of the peasant it was<br>just published last week so it's on my<br>mind and it was on inscriptive studies<br>I'm also going to talk about critical AI<br>which is another editing project that<br>done recently<br>so a fleeting illustrative example of<br>the inscriptive the condition of writing<br>now which is going to help frame some of<br>my remarks almost as a visual epigraph<br>is Shelley Jackson snow which consists<br>of words of a story cut and book type<br>into snow in locations around Brooklyn<br>photographed before they melt and then<br>circulated on Instagram<br>so what we can see in this example is a<br>self-conscious reflection on text as<br>image object record material and process<br>I'm eventually going to close today with<br>another project that's very much<br>swimming in the same Waters a limited<br>edition Letterpress printed text<br>produced by a generative adversarial<br>Network or Gan and I'll explain that<br>eventually<br>so the inscriptive in here is not only<br>an analog or pre-digital practices of<br>writing then and not only in New Media<br>or Digital Arts not even in a fusion or<br>juxtaposition of the two but rather in<br>an engagement with Technologies of<br>writing and information that is deeply<br>invested in the historicity and<br>materiality of platform at the same time<br>that it's broadly agnostic toward it<br>so it's not necessarily occasioned by<br>the many narratives of the ends of the<br>book the end of the print the end of<br>writing or even language but these<br>narratives these Extinction narratives<br>often inform animate and indeed haunt a<br>contemporary art practice that appears<br>to be resolutely committed to the idea<br>that things disappear like words in the<br>snow or become inaccessible like flash<br>so the second field that I've been<br>thinking about critical AI is as this<br>array of titles suggests not one of my<br>own devising<br>the conversation is moving so quickly<br>that it almost eludes mapping<br>particularly for print publication but<br>there is nonetheless a growing archive<br>and the field is coherent and consistent<br>enough for a snapshot definition<br>so in a nutshell critical AI whether<br>focusing on the question of what is<br>meant by intelligence or on the resource<br>costs of training large language models<br>whether focusing on the abstractions of<br>vectorization or cultural<br>representations<br>scholarly work that might be tagged as<br>critical AI seeks to demystify<br>artificial intelligence to counter its<br>mythologizing as of marvelous and<br>impenetrable Black Box<br>and to translate interpret and critique<br>its operations from data collection and<br>I'm going to have more to say about<br>critical AI shortly but I want at this<br>point to highlight some of my research<br>collaborations both editing projects I<br>just outlined were collaborative and I<br>have to acknowledge here Paul Benson and<br>Jennifer Reed as well as minwa a former<br>undergraduate student and my co-author<br>on an article for digital Humanities<br>quarterly on gpt2 and another<br>forthcoming on reading deep learning<br>code again focusing on gpd2<br>the strong turn I've made toward<br>collaborative writing is perhaps in part<br>because of covid it was a way to get<br>through and maintain sociality<br>but it does also reflect changing norms<br>for scholarly communication and<br>Humanities practices where we're clearly<br>seeing a shift away from the loan or<br>single scholar and not just for research<br>that has applied an applied or practical<br>component<br>so the last thing to say by way of<br>offering a self-introduction is that<br>work on questions of the Contemporary<br>has led me recently to make epistemic<br>arguments in different domains to think<br>of what comes after The Society of<br>control or how the Korean media industry<br>has evolved in the Ott era to give two<br>examples and now again more broadly<br>about the field of natural language<br>processing after its so-term imagenet<br>moment<br>what links all of these formulations on<br>or about X year off in 2016 the order of<br>things changed<br>is a certain correspondence between<br>technological Arrangements even machinic<br>orders and socio-cultural formations<br>whether that be Netflix expanding into a<br>fully Global Market or the paradigm<br>shift in NLP occasioned by the<br>Transformer architecture and new<br>techniques of word embedding the use of<br>pre-trained models and the development<br>of massive textile quorum<br>so a strong case can be made I think for<br>February 2019 as another kind of<br>watershed moment in part technological<br>but also importantly discursive and<br>social<br>this is the moment that open AI<br>partially released its large language<br>model gbt 2 which is short for<br>generative retrained Transformer<br>the story of this staged release is at<br>this point perhaps well known but to<br>recount it proceeds from the debut of<br>the partial model in February of that<br>year<br>Fanfare fueled both By the Fantastic<br>tale of ovid's unicorn as well as the<br>suggestion that the model performed too<br>well and thus needed to be guarded<br>against malicious use through the<br>withholding of the full model<br>so avid's unicorn in my title is<br>obviously referring to this moment as<br>you can see the system prompt human<br>written provides the the<br>um as I said the prompt and the model<br>completion the scientists named the<br>population after after their distinctive<br>Horn of its unicorn these four horns<br>silver white unicorns were previously<br>unknown to science<br>there's maybe a media history to be<br>written here I think on the arc that<br>takes us from the mother of all demos<br>dubbing engelbert's um demo in 1968 to<br>the G Wizardry of this moment open AP<br>open api's um model completion samples<br>someone's going to write that story I<br>think<br>because the release was open source and<br>the technological barrier for<br>interaction relatively low<br>the announcement of gpd2 is a better<br>model was a siren song that lured users<br>into a range of experiments to test its<br>capacities as the code went into<br>widespread circulation<br>this then was a textbook instance of a<br>computational object moving from the<br>inert algorithm to the Wild and<br>unpredictable space of collaborative and<br>Collective use<br>extensive user engagement in effect<br>adapting the language model so that it<br>became an interactive object whose<br>function extends well beyond the<br>production of deep learning prediction<br>a common form of experimentation with<br>gpt2 involves fine-tuning so that the<br>process which is the process of editing<br>the model's internal weights by training<br>it on specific texts so it can better<br>emulate them as with a text Adventure<br>game AI dungeon trained on a Choose Your<br>Own Adventure story archive or in the<br>field of electronic literature David<br>Johnson's training of the half size<br>model on a custom poetry purpose for his<br>project rewrites<br>and here I just want to remark on the<br>pace within about 18 months we moved<br>from the publication of rewrites To<br>pharmaco AI the first book co-written<br>with GPT 3.<br>so I have to acknowledge that it might<br>seem somewhat out of Step<br>sorry<br>to rewind back to gpt2 since in it it is<br>actually the exponentially larger and<br>qualitatively GPT 3 that's attracting<br>all the attention<br>for nearly every essay on the future of<br>writing and the institutional and<br>professional Transformations underway<br>and still to come GPT 3 is held up as<br>exhibit a as a sign of where human<br>communication is going<br>in the popular imaginary it's magical<br>and wondrous the tool with which to<br>write your assigned essay if you're a<br>student or your next novel<br>it's also of course perceived as a<br>threat as a means by which jobs will be<br>lost biases reinforced in a fog of<br>disinformation intensified<br>some of the affects that is attached to<br>dgpt3 is in part fueled by its closed<br>Source status<br>even as it's been integrated within<br>hundreds of applications across<br>different domains and industries it<br>remains accessible to the general public<br>only through the application programming<br>interface the API and operationally<br>legible only through experiments who are<br>done by researchers like grin or branwin<br>or attempts at replicating its source<br>code<br>okay so this is going to be a brief<br>technical excursis it will be brief this<br>next short section is crafted for a<br>public audience so for some it might be<br>less than exciting and for others it<br>might be rudimentary but part of my<br>advocacy argument is that we need to we<br>need something like a common<br>understanding so I hope you'll bear with<br>me<br>gpd2 can be described in basic terms as<br>a computational procedure that takes a<br>vectorized token a textual unit as input<br>and outputs a corresponding Vector of<br>token probabilities<br>its internal model of the English<br>language relies on the assumption that<br>the current words in a sequence<br>determine the occurrence of subsequent<br>words<br>so at each prediction timestamp<br>gbd2 outputs the probability of every<br>textual unit in its vocabulary given the<br>previous words in a sequence<br>so while a common understanding of the<br>model in action might be that it's<br>writing what it is actually doing is<br>sampling<br>the ordinary meaning of sampling a<br>literary Musical and artistic practice<br>of incorporating selections of existing<br>Works into something new or the drawing<br>of a random observation from a<br>probability distribution pertain to<br>sampling as it's understood in the<br>context of probabilistic language models<br>an important distinction I'm drawing on<br>here is between or an important<br>distinction I am drawing it between the<br>model which gives us predictive outputs<br>in the form of numerical data each<br>individual token and the output string<br>is still encoded as numbers<br>and the transforming of that data into<br>readable text which can be understood in<br>general terms as a process of<br>translation or assigning meaning<br>so to make that distinction clear<br>consider the example of a classifier<br>trained to classify tumors<br>depending on the data the outputs might<br>be zero or one which would not be<br>meaningful without assigning them<br>respective values of benign or malignant<br>such a classification would be<br>necessarily arbitrary<br>and this serves as a reminder of the<br>real interpretive work that happens in<br>the transformation of numerical output<br>into linguistic form<br>this process the interpretation and<br>manipulation of raw output and seemingly<br>unlimited ways has I think a great deal<br>of creative and ethical political<br>potential that makes it a particularly<br>fertile area for both analysis and<br>experimentation<br>so you can contrast my exuberance on<br>this point with the dominant affects not<br>just fear and anxiety are you scared yet<br>human<br>but of course also a kind of<br>technobusterism<br>public conversation about large language<br>models is nothing if not riddled with<br>sensation<br>even apart from the high-profile drama<br>of open AIS withholding of its full<br>initial of a full release or more<br>recently the Google Engineers claim of<br>sentience for its conversational model<br>the reporting on the research advances<br>in NLP almost inevitably cultivates some<br>degree of alarm and erratic mystery<br>some of this affect is generalizable to<br>the field of artificial intelligence<br>which continues to be overcoated as<br>dangerous and too complex to understand<br>but the enclosure of the NLP research<br>environment behind apis and the<br>concomitant development of language<br>models requiring compute resources<br>beyond the means of ordinary users has<br>also contributed to the mystification<br>so paradigmatic headlines such as AI as<br>mastering language should we trust what<br>it says communicate the threat of a<br>singular and Unstoppable thing called AI<br>with humans relegated to the role of end<br>users<br>so one Salient question for researchers<br>then is how best to demystify large<br>language models and explain their<br>functioning<br>not only to help shape a socio-technical<br>consensus about their responsible<br>application but also to expand the<br>Horizon of possibility for human<br>engagement Beyond instrumental use and<br>risk assessment<br>so to answer this question my suggestion<br>is we look not to the model itself but<br>to projects built on top of the model<br>which is a so far neglected area of<br>studying<br>applications and implementations like<br>the Texas Adventure game AI dungeon I<br>mentioned earlier and a language art<br>project called this word does not exist<br>which I will turn to now attest to the<br>significance of the work of developers<br>outside in this instance open Ai and the<br>vibrancy of the collaborative spirit in<br>borrowing its title from the notorious<br>deep fake application this person does<br>not exist<br>which is made with again and I'll talk<br>about again soon this word does not<br>exist offers up fake words cunningly<br>assuming the form of the principal<br>managerial apparatus for linguistic<br>standardization the dictionary<br>thus these words do not exist<br>micromagnesis the production of disease<br>causing microorganisms<br>or reconditee Diet a mold resembling a<br>decoctioning used as an artistic work to<br>create an impression of something<br>original<br>to generate words such as these the<br>programmer scraped Urban Dictionary for<br>a training data set to fine-tune gpt2<br>and condition it to generate strings of<br>text that have the embedded structure of<br>a dictionary entry with the word part of<br>speech definition and exemplary usage<br>what's particularly clever about the<br>framing here is that the titular words<br>do not exist in at least two sentences<br>in at least two senses<br>it's not simply that infrometric is a<br>representative word invented defined and<br>used by Machine learning algorithm<br>but that the model itself is not<br>actually outputting at words what does<br>it work in other words it's not language<br>generation but rather function returns<br>so to hearken back to the supposed<br>liveness of Google's conversational AI<br>system we might then say that good<br>output by whatever metric might summon<br>the fantasy of model sentience but this<br>is easily countered by an interface such<br>as this word does not exist which<br>Engineers the output in a manner that<br>exposes gbd2 as a near function<br>returning four pieces of structured<br>lexicographic data<br>so what I'm highlighting with this<br>example is the relatively low bar for<br>engagement with language models and deep<br>learning application development more<br>generally<br>coding in Python an easily accessible<br>and Common Language overshadowed only by<br>JavaScript and HTML<br>and opening the source code model up<br>high to be callable implicitly invites<br>other python users to interact and<br>experiment with your model<br>in the case of this word does not exist<br>the humor or the fun derives not from<br>gpt2 not in other words from the model<br>but from the code that structures the<br>numerical data and it is this type and<br>site of coding practice that is the<br>means by which developers of all<br>abilities including those who are not<br>specialists in machine learning can<br>Tinker with gpt2 manipulate its outputs<br>and more broadly operationalize the<br>model so it serves as a medium for<br>so I'm using the example of The<br>Blacklist for this word does not exist<br>for this next point<br>part of openai's stated rationale for<br>the withholding of the full model we<br>recall was concern about potential<br>misuse which would include not only just<br>for information but also hate speech<br>there was then and is now work being<br>done at the level of the model and the<br>training data to guard against the<br>emergence of another Microsoft a<br>but it's nonetheless left to developers<br>to determine the acceptable parameters<br>of their applications and<br>implementations of gpt2 in other words<br>to manage and regulate its output<br>pattern matching regular expressions and<br>filtering all examples of ordinary<br>functions are some of the means toward<br>this end so if this then if this profane<br>word then delete<br>the need for such ad hoc techniques at<br>all stages of the communication pipeline<br>however from fine-tuning data to the<br>post-processing of output serves as a<br>reminder that the wild expressivity of<br>natural language generation can take<br>both negative and affirmative form hence<br>the public discourse on risk and<br>responsibility<br>so a summary point for this section is<br>this<br>critical thinking about NLP focuses<br>commonly focuses on training data and<br>the deleterious effects of so-term<br>foundation models which is perhaps as it<br>should be but there is much to be said<br>for getting under the hood so to speak<br>to the extent that one can<br>improving gpt2 or any deep learning<br>model truly making them better models<br>certainly depends on the modification of<br>model architecture and the development<br>of training data but organizing its<br>output I think is a no less meaningful<br>means by which to direct the model's<br>functioning all the more so again<br>because it's a technique and Tool that's<br>so my next example is Anna Riddler's<br>installation Myriad tulips<br>which consists of thousands of<br>photographs of tulips taken over the<br>course of three months in the<br>Netherlands their meticulous gridded<br>Arrangement on the wall presenting its<br>geometric abstraction at a distance<br>up close the colors shapes and textures<br>of the individual flowers become<br>apparent the subjective perceptual frame<br>underscored by the handwritten labels<br>that are not didactics with Botanical<br>metadata but rather a registering of<br>attributes as as processed by the human<br>eye<br>dead blooming some Stripes no stripes<br>the digital photographs themselves<br>comprise a training data set for<br>Riddler's subsequent artwork mosaic<br>virus which uses a generative<br>adversarial Network or Gan for an<br>iterative production of fake tulips that<br>reflect on speculative forms of value<br>the Gan is the is the model that<br>produces the Deep Faith it's comprised<br>of two networks that collaborate to<br>produce synthetic images that can pass<br>as real there's a generator that<br>produces images based on a training data<br>set in this case the photographs of<br>tulips and a discriminator that<br>classifies the output as either real<br>which is to say from the training data<br>or fake produced by the generator<br>so the technical and conceptual<br>complexity of mosaic virus might seem to<br>overshadow the photographic installation<br>but of course this data set is the<br>necessary precondition and taken<br>together the two Works make visible the<br>end-to-end apparatus of artificial<br>intelligence from the from the human<br>labor of image classification data<br>curation and machine learning model<br>architecture design to the material<br>infrastructural support of gpus and the<br>management and manipulation of generated<br>output<br>Riddler's work is an aesthetic<br>engagement with machine learning that<br>Delights and instructs translating<br>machinic instruments instrumentalization<br>which is still the BET Noir of the<br>humanities into the Lexicon of cultural<br>critique<br>it situates AI with an intertwined<br>genealogies of capitalism and scientific<br>research drawing on established<br>representational techniques and<br>foregrounding the Optics of the human<br>Observer while at the same time posing<br>questions about the position of the<br>human in relation to socio-technical<br>systems that seem ever more vast and<br>complicated their scale oppositely<br>captured in the etymology of myriad the<br>numerable slipping into the innumerable<br>Riddler's Riddler's work is one example<br>of an art practice that's<br>self-reflexively uses the tools and<br>techniques of machine learning also<br>perfectly encapsulates indexes and<br>indeed embodies a critical perspective<br>on artificial intelligence one that both<br>informs and is shaped by academic<br>research on the same<br>in its invocation of the Dutch tulip<br>trade and the history of capital<br>Riddler's work offers a way of seeing<br>that runs counter to the still pervasive<br>presentism of the discourse on AI<br>and it cunningly at the same time allows<br>for the now customary affects of awe and<br>wonder while also demystifying some of<br>the product some of the procedures of<br>in her elevation of the training data<br>set to the status of a named individual<br>artwork Riddler gestures toward a prying<br>open of the proverbial Black Box<br>emphasizing her direct even authorial<br>connection to the data which she has<br>collected and labeled herself<br>this in contrast to the imagenet<br>database both in its development with<br>the assistance of anonymous mechanical<br>turkers and its attendant and<br>well-documented normative and<br>epistemological assumptions<br>to the extent that it can be said that<br>imagenet and the corollary shifting of<br>institutional resources to the<br>development of massive labeled training<br>data sets is in part what makes possible<br>the accelerative developments in machine<br>learning research over the course of the<br>past decade<br>it can also be said that a data set<br>that's collected curated and labeled by<br>an individual researcher offers a<br>necessary and meaningful Parallax view<br>of the processes of image recognition<br>and generation<br>what Riddler is doing is modeling data<br>sovereignty then the operative the<br>operative principle of which is that the<br>collection control use and preservation<br>of data should be legible to and even in<br>the hands of the communities that are<br>so now a few words about nomenclature<br>the machine learning slash AI of my<br>presentation title<br>AI of course is what commands attention<br>hence this ubiquitous mean with<br>Statistics framed first as machine<br>learning crickets and then hyped as<br>artificial intelligence huge audience<br>AI thus functions as shorthand in<br>headlines marketing copy and popular<br>representations and in this sense<br>falsely implies something singular and<br>unprecedented as SDS scholar Lucy<br>suchman has argued<br>suggesting a structure of feeling as<br>well as a set of cultural techniques<br>that are often not specified much less<br>described<br>artificial intelligence is as is often<br>protested with some futility not only a<br>reductive term but it also arguably<br>perpetuates the magical thinking of the<br>sort that one can see in some of the<br>headlines I cited earlier<br>there are times though when a kind of<br>linguistic pragmatism is necessary so<br>for my purpose today and indeed for the<br>emerging subfield of critical ai ai<br>itself is treated neodynamically and<br>artificial intelligence is conceived as<br>concept ideology and dispotes<br>disposative<br>as an assemblage of technological<br>arrangements and socio-technical<br>practices and as an historical and<br>epistemic formation<br>this may seem to open up fairly quickly<br>into the domain of critical thinking<br>about computational culture writ large<br>but there is a specificity and an<br>analytic Precision in the focus on data<br>algorithms models and the production of<br>production<br>so consider then a contrast between a<br>vision of AI that can only take illusory<br>and Elusive figurative form on the<br>horizon as it does at the climax of<br>William Gibson's novel Neuromancer with<br>a hugely powerful AI comes into being<br>or a vision of AI that manifests as<br>romantic objects whether as disembodied<br>a prismatic voice of Her<br>or the fembots and absolute boyfriends<br>of many a drama<br>consider this Vision on the one hand and<br>on the other a televisual engagement<br>that issues spectral and spectacular<br>figures and focuses instead on a screen<br>display of an actual image recognition<br>algorithm as does the first episode of<br>the Korean drama start up<br>such a dramatic scene in a romance that<br>romanticizes the Practical applications<br>rather than the mystical qualities of<br>autonomous machines might be said to<br>Mark a moment in which AI has achieved<br>technological Authority and social<br>Consciousness and now demands an<br>accurate presentation and in this<br>respect I think it serves as the perfect<br>visual frame for the field of critical<br>AI<br>well<br>Artisan researchers are developing new<br>methods practices and concepts for this<br>critical project<br>the premise is that artists working<br>directly or even directly with machine<br>learning systems are particularly well<br>positioned to stress test evaluate and<br>exploit them to probe and reveal their<br>limitations so as to communicate these<br>to the public and even advocate for<br>again better which is to say fair<br>transparent and accountable data sets<br>models and applications<br>critical AI thus Endeavors to understand<br>its objects through Hands-On practical<br>engagement whether in a lab an archive<br>or a classroom<br>the field which is marked by its yoking<br>of explanation and critique fights<br>imminent thinking and by its tendency<br>toward an active performative or<br>otherwise practical forms of Engagement<br>has settled to a certain extent on a set<br>of ethical political Investments even as<br>it's tethering to the instrumentalities<br>of machine learning mean that its<br>Concepts and paradigms have to remain<br>unsettled so that they can remain<br>responsive and responsible<br>critical AI then is itself an historical<br>and epistemic formation<br>just as there are well-documented waves<br>or phases of research in artificial<br>intelligence and machine learning<br>undergirded most notably by the<br>exponential growth of data science the<br>availability of Greater compute<br>resources and the development of novel<br>architectures<br>so too does academic work both reflect<br>and remain attuned to actually existing<br>socio-technical systems<br>so just to give a sense of the critical<br>AI as an academic growth industry I'll<br>highlight this partial list of research<br>centers and initiatives the last one the<br>faculty working group on critical<br>machine learning studies is actually one<br>for which I'm co-pi at the moment<br>okay so my third and last application<br>which is particularly meaningful because<br>it's nominally and deliberately<br>meaningless<br>is Allison parish's acnic artwork which<br>I'm going to pronounce as when it tense<br>in<br>published this year by aliator which is<br>a small press specializing in<br>computer-generated literature<br>the Preparatory a and a cmic negates the<br>scene the smallest unit of meaning<br>so the acemic is that which looks like a<br>language it has the appearance of<br>symbols characters and glyphs as with<br>this page but it cannot be deciphered<br>much less read or pronounced<br>it does gestures to writing evoking and<br>enacting the gestures of writing<br>reflexively thematizing and Performing<br>the active inscription but without<br>content<br>fake writing invented scripts imaginary<br>languages is not new to the 21st century<br>and there are a number of precursors and<br>corresponding art practices that bear a<br>family resemblance to it among them<br>glitch Aesthetics and the optically<br>dense textual layers of overprinting and<br>overwriting<br>indeed There is almost no more canonical<br>work of electronic literature than<br>telling them it's telling them it's<br>Lexia to perplexia<br>so it should come as no surprise that<br>decades later writers continue to probe<br>the limits or the edge if perplexia can<br>be recuperated as legible then where can<br>the line now be drawn between writing<br>and non-writing<br>how to negate not just your<br>signification<br>so Allison Parrish has done precisely<br>this by training again not on words not<br>on sub words letters or tokens but<br>rather on pixels<br>hands again produce images that resemble<br>the training data set which in this<br>instance was a bitmap data set of among<br>other things capital letters lowercase<br>words ligatures very typeface<br>the new words<br>and if I read maybe the something like<br>the Meyer ribra<br>were then generated pixel by pixel and<br>arranged in lines taking the form of<br>alphabetic writing and in a further<br>invocation of print culture Letterpress<br>printed and bound by hand<br>the goal she says is to produce visual<br>forms that call attention to the<br>conventional appearances and operations<br>of text forms that afford reading while<br>remaining unreadable<br>Parish has a long-term interest in<br>exploring and exploiting the materiality<br>of language beginning with the Twitter<br>bot every word this was a seven year<br>project that tweeted out a word every<br>half hour<br>and the context for her art practice and<br>here I widened back out to a field of<br>practice and an academic study is the<br>heightened awareness of the intensified<br>generation and circulation of language<br>across media environments by human and<br>non-human agents alike<br>of the proliferation of screens and more<br>broadly of a complex technological<br>situation in which all media are mixed<br>reshaped and realigned as a consequence<br>of an exponential explosion in the<br>quantity of information as well as in<br>forms of communicative practices<br>this Twitter box performed the<br>exponential increase by going through<br>the dictionary more than once<br>so the words<br>coming to a conclusion here the words of<br>when it tints in have been printed you<br>might be able to make this out without a<br>full reservoir of ink<br>and in this respect they present as if<br>in a state of decomposition fragile and<br>vulnerable to all of those external<br>environmental forces that will<br>eventually bring about The Disappearance<br>toward which it virtually gestures<br>in its partial printing the work<br>actualizes the prescriptive and<br>performative potential of symbolicity<br>and at the same time it serves as a<br>reminder of the multiple ways in which<br>Simplicity might fail it's words or<br>better tokens<br>unrealized obscured or even destroyed<br>so too the words of Shelley Jackson's<br>story snow which can and do melt<br>what might at first glance appear to be<br>a narrative of certain laws however is<br>in fact about contingency<br>and here I find especially provocative<br>parishes framing of her work<br>part of what I want to do as a poet she<br>says is invent forms of language so new<br>that even gbt2 can't predict them yet<br>yes I realized there's an irony in<br>trying to use machine learning to<br>achieve that goal<br>it is ironic but it is also deeply<br>sincere<br>precisely because the symbolic order of<br>language has been made machinic by ever<br>more powerful language models<br>because so termed minority languages are<br>exponentially dying<br>because we are told repeatedly that no<br>one reads that text is just one form of<br>streaming media among many and an<br>insignificant one at that<br>a work such as when distance in is both<br>powerful and necessary<br>not as an elegy not as an evocation of<br>nostalgia or Romance<br>or a utopian desire for written culture<br>as the synchronon of stable and<br>functional societies<br>but rather as a contingent imminent<br>inquiry into the conditions of<br>possibility that inform textual<br>production in the Contemporary moment<br>thank you<br>so thank you that was a mind-expanding<br>talk uh very cool thank you very much<br>for coming back from the future to to<br>give it to us uh and it reminds me that<br>I've got a bit of work to do before I<br>get to the Future uh so let's uh let's<br>do a wee bit of that work so first of<br>all a slight caveat I hate questions<br>that start with a caveat but I'm not a<br>language scholar I'm a philosopher so I<br>think that this is kind of Outsider Art<br>if you like but<br>um typical of a philosopher a couple of<br>um we've transcended the order of<br>natural language and when I look at the<br>examples that you give<br>some of them felt like Evolution and<br>some of them felt like Transcendence and<br>there's a tendency to think that<br>Transcendence is is this higher thing<br>than Evolution but evolution<br>tremendously powerful<br>and so I wondered when we stepped from<br>one to the other whether you<br>whether you've got Transcendence is in<br>this context<br>the other question also about meaning is<br>about demystification so many people in<br>this room I know you know interested in<br>artificial intelligence and a lot of<br>discussion about transparency and<br>explanation<br>and when you say AI is mastered language<br>you know and we trust what it does or<br>what it says then we naturally want to<br>you know see the cogs or talk to an<br>expert who can tell us about the<br>regularities tell us about science if I<br>put me in the sentence James has<br>mastered language can we trust what he<br>says now you might want to cut my head<br>open but I think you probably don't I<br>think you just want to know what I do<br>so you know one of the big challenges<br>for people who work on AI is this you<br>know what counts of transparency here<br>how much do people know what should we<br>tell the jury all these sorts of things<br>sometimes demystification really just<br>seems like familiarization so I wonder<br>what demystification means for you<br>thank you yeah thank you very<br>much<br>um okay so I just I'll go backwards<br>um the field of explainable Arts<br>artificial intelligence is of course<br>extremely important to me<br>um one of I didn't make this point but<br>of course the<br>the reason the first reason that I focus<br>on 252 is its openness there are more<br>models that are being developed now that<br>are open I think is it bloom or retro so<br>you know every big Tech Corporation<br>worth itself is developing its own<br>language model most of them are closed<br>but there are a few that are open<br>gpd2 it was this moment of 18 months<br>worth of excitement I mean it still<br>persists right precisely because you<br>could play around and see what was<br>happening it was that and at that level<br>explanation<br>had a very basic or limited meaning I<br>want to understand what is happening now<br>once I understand what I can do with<br>this thing which is to say that I think<br>explainable artificial intelligence<br>which has a big task in front of us<br>can do would you well to narrow some at<br>some level its aims or its goals<br>um the Big Goal full explainability<br>um might forever elude it but if it if<br>we take more of the incremental<br>step-by-step approach think not in terms<br>of the goal which is total explanation<br>but rather means you know along the way<br>I think that that um<br>the public might be satisfied and we<br>might who knows how things might evolve<br>um the Stanford conference on the bad<br>effects of Downstream of foundation<br>models was in part trying to make the<br>point that explanation gets foreclosed<br>precisely in the use of a foundation<br>model which then becomes a Cornerstone<br>for further building and is relegated to<br>the position of<br>ancestor or precursor that doesn't need<br>any longer critical attention because<br>we're instead going to focus in the<br>models that come in its way<br>um so this is by way of saying that the<br>field as a whole is is in many ways<br>trying to emphasize explanation and<br>understanding not everyone has the same<br>definition or understanding of<br>understanding<br>um but but I think maybe this moment of<br>let a thousand flowers bloom let's try<br>to figure out<br>not only let's try to figure out what<br>we're going to do with language models<br>but let's try to figure out how we're<br>going to understand them that might not<br>um okay so to rewrite to your first part<br>of your question is Transcendence<br>awesome<br>yeah<br>um so as as you might have surmised I am<br>very concerned with the public<br>conversation the rhetoric the framing of<br>art machine learning or artificial<br>intelligence and the part of my my<br>framing<br>in terms of assumptions you know the<br>putative transplant sends into the<br>supposed Transcendence is in part<br>picking up on the rhetoric and the kind<br>of assumptions that seem to be faked<br>into the conversation so even embedded<br>into the idea AI is mastering language<br>right<br>um<br>the famous<br>I won't be able to get the quotation<br>mark But the famous anecdote of the um<br>the engineer at I think a Google<br>conference a few years ago who had a<br>t-shirt that effectively said Cuban<br>language doesn't matter or language<br>doesn't matter anymore its language is<br>over I I should have that quotation down<br>but that becomes this kind of flash<br>point for for that assumption that<br>natural so term natural language is<br>um not important and in fact the<br>argument was made we don't need lingles<br>anymore<br>because we're not we don't we're not<br>work with language without level<br>so that if that was a you know quite a<br>relative move to relegate<br>um how to bring this is a concern of<br>many how to bring linguists back into<br>the conversation or how to bring<br>how to think in terms of maybe D natural<br>language generation like what would it<br>mean to to actually even destabilize<br>that distinction<br>um what would it mean to bring the not<br>just the linguist but the humanists and<br>not just these qualitative researchers<br>more generally back into the<br>conversation so that they're not<br>positioned just at the end assessing<br>output which is usually where you bring<br>in the the qualitative researcher is to<br>say here's your Turing test was this<br>output produced by a language model or<br>not right so we're we're in the position<br>of just assessment and the question<br>would be how is it that<br>um again I want to say qualitative<br>researchers just the way I'm not<br>thinking in terms of humanities versus<br>non-humanities but how can qualitative<br>researchers have more of a say<br>even be part of the conversation at the<br>level of the foundation that would be a<br>question or a project that I would hope<br>to continue<br>excellent thank you very much on on the<br>the first bit the explanation bit I love<br>the focus on manipulability a lovely<br>example from the history of science so<br>science as you'll know is often people<br>discovering phenomena working out a<br>theory that covers the phenomenon and<br>then writing papers about it and sending<br>everybody the theory when Faraday<br>discovers the electric motor he sends<br>everybody a kit<br>from which you can make your electric<br>motor and play with it and so your your<br>version of demystification is is kind of<br>we can play with it which I think is<br>brilliant<br>it is absolutely and it's very much in<br>the same Spirit as<br>um the maker Labs<br>um<br>in let's say biotech you know cultural<br>investigations with biotechnology even<br>the maker lab that is in the English<br>Department here the digital Humanities<br>lab so or the printed work with printing<br>presses and so forth so I I think it's a<br>natural segue is to try to understand<br>what's happening in a GitHub repository<br>thanks Rita I just want to follow on a<br>bit from James's point so I'm<br>or an AI person than a well not at all<br>the humanities person so this could be a<br>little bit naive<br>from an AI researcher's point of view<br>explainability or<br>um black box if you like is really about<br>the models you know the model itself in<br>neural network<br>um<br>having open code is great and that's<br>easily understood by us but actually the<br>neural network models are not understood<br>even by the people who create them in<br>certain terms of how they make their<br>decisions so just wondering if you had<br>see but your definition seems a little<br>bit broader than that or wider than that<br>and I just wonder if you had any<br>comments about<br>um yeah sort of different<br>yeah and<br>for me the kind of paradigmatic scene<br>for this comes in the documentary about<br>alphagos battle with use it all there's<br>a moment when the Deep line Engineers<br>are watching the the play and they kind<br>of throw up their hands at a certain<br>point and say in in effect we don't know<br>what just happened we don't understand<br>um that for me is a kind of classroom<br>now I think now canonical scene right so<br>on the one hand<br>they're just technically true yes but<br>that I think it's overcoded as that that<br>moment of non-understanding then becomes<br>becomes General so that like a public<br>from the perspective of a public<br>audience you watch that and you think<br>what is being built is something that is<br>is fully incomprehensible in other words<br>that question that that moment of not<br>understanding becomes so big and so<br>broad is to be overwhelming and there's<br>almost a kind of um<br>Sublimity to it to the move right that<br>it's terrifying because we don't<br>understand it so I<br>I again I'm sort of thinking about the<br>public framing or the discourse that<br>surrounds these things<br>um<br>I mean to<br>to approach us from a different angle I<br>would say that another thing that I'm<br>interested in thinking about is how<br>technical explanations let's say it<br>began by Goodfellow at all have recourse<br>to rhetoric have recourse to story have<br>recourse to figurative speech analogy in<br>order to explain functioning so in the<br>Gann paper they say in order to<br>understand how a generative adversarial<br>network works you have to think in terms<br>of currency and then they conjure up the<br>scene imagine trying to pass off<br>currency is fake and it it becomes this<br>it becomes a fable right so it is<br>interesting to think of how explanation<br>at that moment moves into a kind of<br>abstraction or what a Humanities scholar<br>would call a con fiction essentially so<br>there too I think there is an<br>interesting way in which<br>income the incomprehensible gets<br>mystified and that is again that's what<br>I'm sort of trying to poke at um which<br>is not by way of saying that I that it<br>doesn't it doesn't exist as an actual<br>problem it indeed probably was the case<br>that the Deep Mind Engineers did not<br>understand at that moment it's not<br>entirely clear later on that they might<br>not have been able to understand but at<br>that precise moment<br>indeed there's a moment of throwing up<br>your hands and dismay or wonder in that<br>case amusement<br>yeah I guess um I guess there's<br>different levels of not understanding<br>right so I can read Goodfellows paper<br>and I can understand yeah I know how to<br>build this thing now that I've read that<br>paper but that doesn't mean I really<br>understand what the model itself is<br>doing to make a particular decision if<br>you like<br>just because of the way it's constructed<br>for me the big worry is the move to the<br>API right it's not my worry alone but if<br>you can't if you can't call the model at<br>all then you really are and you are that<br>much further removed<br>any questions from the linguists before<br>foreign<br>paraphrasing that question so we get it<br>on the recording the best you can yeah<br>what happens to<br>the paradigms or the models of language<br>that humans have developed do they<br>translate over into this new<br>scene or sight<br>is that partly what you're asking<br>yeah yeah it's gone<br>in a nutshell<br>um<br>I I would be yeah<br>had I had a capacity and had were<br>language models so developed it would be<br>interesting to be able to think about<br>this from your perspective of<br>non-english of course you know the<br>corpora that's used to train gp2 is is<br>great from the English language internet<br>um<br>their uh weibo I believe I forget the<br>name exactly the corporation that that<br>there is a Chinese language large<br>language model would be competition and<br>so forth but for the most part we're<br>dealing with English exactly<br>so<br>the reason to make this point is that<br>um<br>that I think is less ontology than it is<br>grammar and syntax and structure<br>yeah<br>but to test that it would be helpful to<br>have a kind of Parallax wheel with a<br>different language I think<br>thank you very much Rita since you were<br>nice enough to include it<br>um<br>Letterpress printing as part of your<br>Universe<br>um I had a question about Allison<br>parish's book and talking about<br>alphabetic letters as well because you<br>said it's based on the Unicode set<br>presumably that's the Unicode set of<br>Roman or<br>alphabetic letters as opposed to all the<br>other symbols that are in Unicode<br>um but also<br>you said it's Letterpress I'm just<br>curious physically<br>were there individual sorts for each<br>item or was it a block that was produced<br>really by the computer and then<br>impressed into the paper yes but not<br>really what I would call that are Press<br>Printing in terms of putting each piece<br>together to make the line<br>physically all right so okay so just to<br>clarify so it's actually not Unicode<br>that's the thing it's images it's just<br>at the level of the pixel<br>so so<br>okay so what's guiding the machine<br>learning shaping of the pixels into a<br>pattern<br>different typefaces okay so there were<br>no existing typefaces for some of those<br>letters at all right right okay in which<br>case it has to be some kind of block<br>that just then just be able to be<br>impressed in the paper I got that okay<br>that's fine that's all I want to know<br>thanks it's just like<br>that's fine<br>thank you that was really interesting<br>um I come as a teacher of literature I<br>come back to whether AI can actually<br>write what we would understand is<br>literature and when you said that at the<br>beginning that a sentence that can<br>figure out where a sentence is going to<br>go<br>uh to me that sounds a bit like<br>prescriptive texting predictive texting<br>you know that you're working with the<br>commonest words and the commonest<br>phrases and things like that whereas<br>when I think about literature and people<br>who write literature they make it new in<br>the famous phrase and it goes in<br>directions that nobody else has ever<br>thought of and that's what makes it<br>interesting to us and more than<br>interesting inspiring and exciting and<br>all the rest of it so and I'm thinking<br>of a wonderful book that was written<br>about Shakespeare's sonnets and uh by a<br>guy from Berkeley whose name<br>forgotten but I will remember in two<br>seconds that and he pointed out that<br>Shakespeare takes you to a certain point<br>in each as each word goes in a sequence<br>and you think yes I'm with you I'm with<br>you I'm with you<br>and then it goes in a different<br>direction and surprises you<br>so what I would call literature is full<br>of surprises and unexpectedness<br>was what I gathered perhaps wrongly from<br>the start of what you said is that what<br>what AI can do as far as writing<br>literature is concerned is predictable<br>for spring for capacity of an AI system<br>chess<br>Checkers first chess go so too is<br>literature but the means in turing's<br>famous paper which is kind of<br>conventionally or<br>yeah in general terms understood to<br>contain something like 85 of artificial<br>intelligence this is probably apocryphal<br>but I think John McCain and AI<br>researchers said something throughout<br>effect and people they do regard it as<br>these terms anyway in turing's paper on<br>Computing machinery and intelligence of<br>course it's the writing of the sonnet<br>when he proposes as thought experiments<br>very you know various objections it is<br>you know this the machine will never<br>produce the songs<br>so in other words yes exactly the the<br>unexpected the kind of literariness of a<br>sonnet has been the um kind of brass<br>ring right the amount like the imagined<br>goal and I don't think that Allison<br>parish is is really that far apart like<br>in her wanting to think about forms of<br>language that are not predictable she's<br>also I think<br>um in some way paying homage to our<br>historical fascination with the surprise<br>move the swerve or the the aliatory the<br>unexpected community possible<br>italic albino when he's early thinking<br>in an essay on cybernetics and ghosts<br>he's also thinking about the formulaic<br>quality of writing and the the question<br>will be not how to reproduce the formula<br>because of course the formulaic it's a<br>it's a formula it can be automated right<br>so even there he's talking some 50 odd<br>years ago about the the unpredictable<br>and it's<br>which will never be captured because<br>always elusive<br>um I think it's interesting I mean one<br>of the reasons why Allison parishes is<br>really for me now a primary example is<br>that it shows that in order to achieve<br>the unpredictable you really have to go<br>outside of language you have to treat it<br>as an image and you have to treat it as<br>is really the the appearance of language<br>not language itself<br>because otherwise for something like<br>pharmaco AI which was the first book<br>written co-written with eight with the<br>gpt3<br>there's there's a sense well it's just<br>in some ways bad writing but you're not<br>entirely sure who or what is during the<br>out you know the writing you have to<br>trust whether it's it's just like with<br>gpt2s the opening eyes samples of<br>unicorn you have to trust with the open<br>AI Institute you're not kind of massage<br>the output there and give you a better<br>version of this of the sample<br>um I'm okay like winding my way away<br>from your question but this is by way of<br>saying that I think that<br>set of qualities or attributes that we<br>have historically associated with the<br>literary I think these still persist the<br>question will be can they be replicated<br>can you actually produce<br>the unpredictable any longer what would<br>it mean to create something truly out of<br>Glory that is I think a harder question<br>and maybe that's why we have to go to<br>wind it since and to get something like<br>there is a word of language Resonance of<br>language yes absolutely there is a<br>residence of language<br>um<br>that's right I picked it up<br>um does anyone else have a question<br>I mean I'm just thinking of<br>a training Corpus of 25 million<br>Alice Alice in Paris texts that would<br>then<br>by definition create surprise and<br>iteratively shift our understanding of<br>surprise in the same way that we've you<br>I mean it's okay I can put this question<br>back to the group actually so for<br>something else I'm working on with our<br>critical machine learning group we're<br>writing a piece on failure<br>and I keep arguing that the concept of<br>failure doesn't exist with language<br>models of course it does to a certain<br>extent but<br>everything is recuperable as poetry<br>essentially so you get of its unicorn or<br>you get you get just utter nonsense and<br>it gets like what would Define failure<br>of success I mean of course you know you<br>can have practical a practical<br>explanation for this I had my students<br>write papers with gpd3 and I got<br>inaccurate statements about Virginia<br>Woolf let's say and I can say well the<br>model failed but it's also really the<br>student that failed and not being able<br>to massage the output or not being able<br>to recognize that the the truth claim is<br>not true so I don't know if this is<br>something I'm still thinking about again<br>like whether you can actually have a<br>concept of failure with respect to a<br>language model which is by way of saying<br>maybe it's all surprise and that's<br>precisely why<br>um artists are or writers are struggling<br>to recapture or recuperate surprise but<br>thanks very much so that okay I'm going<br>to try to I'm actually a person from the<br>past from around 1811 or so I think but<br>because the question that I had might be<br>connected with that failure can you<br>think about that that section that you<br>had about those the made of words I'm<br>sorry I really am from 1811 so I don't<br>know but you had the series of the<br>made-up words<br>um and the thing that struck me about<br>those made up words is that I was like<br>looking for the Latin or the Greek root<br>for why they would make sense as a<br>made-up word and and I saw as far as I<br>could tell I didn't see anything that<br>would suggest that this computer had<br>kind of figured out on the humans or the<br>in order to make words you often draw in<br>other languages and I thought oh what<br>would be really cool is if that new word<br>was like made up of something from<br>French and Tamil and whatever but it<br>became this new word<br>that meant something<br>new<br>that doesn't seem to be what the<br>computer was either capable of or maybe<br>what what people were even kind of after<br>so I guess to me that was a failure<br>because there was nothing about that<br>word that gave the Resonance of of the<br>of the definition of that word<br>whereas a success would have been you<br>know the word somehow connecting with<br>its definition in a in a<br>interesting cool surprising<br>now going back to 1811. yeah I mean I<br>suppose<br>right so I mean in some ways because<br>it's working with the formulation not<br>just this person doesn't exist but then<br>there was a<br>and just an exponential increase in<br>these things this cat does not exist<br>this why food does not exist this rental<br>does not exist everyone was creating<br>again generated site to create fake<br>images or fake pictures so he's working<br>in that tradition and so you might say<br>well<br>precisely because he was working in that<br>tradition shouldn't he aim for<br>etymological accuracy is there in other<br>words if you're going to simulate the<br>dictionary simulated activity<br>but I find I what I find interesting is<br>that it's more of a container<br>the usage the definition the word and<br>all of the punctuary are all of the<br>pronunciation keys are wrong<br>I mean I haven't<br>loaded a million words but those that<br>I've seen are all inaccurate so it's<br>it's really the like the AC makes the<br>gesture of writing<br>and and in that sense I think that the<br>great book ends with<br>it's just performing writing<br>so if it were if it were actually<br>accurate etymology I think in some ways<br>then I would talk about the project is<br>failing<br>because at that level it is just doing<br>the work of language generation<br>I think because it's a little bent or a<br>little twisted in other words a little<br>long I think that's maybe that's the<br>hi I'm just going to take advantage of<br>the microphone being near me<br>um I was just curious uh a response you<br>had earlier about<br>um it would be good to have a<br>non-english<br>data set and in particular<br>non-alphabetic data set and they've got<br>me thinking I mean is are people doing<br>this Beyond writing so with spoken or<br>signed language this same kind of um<br>generation and it'd be interesting to<br>see or hear yeah okay so to just go back<br>a little bit another way to answer the<br>question is to say if you were to get<br>the accurate definition that would just<br>be gpt2 right because it it does code<br>completion scatter plot graphs recipes<br>Etc so<br>I mean Coke and fishing is a better<br>example than right than anything else<br>because it's writing but it's just I<br>mean that is actually fairly easy<br>so to speak<br>I mean no because the training corpora<br>is again English right so<br>within those limits<br>um<br>I mean it does okay so yeah it of course<br>does summarization and reading I<br>shouldn't<br>leave you with the impression that it's<br>only generating<br>you know that it is actually<br>um and it's quite good a correction for<br>what it's worth all of our students<br>probably couldn't will be using it to<br>clean up their grammar<br>you did<br>it's much rather than grammarly or any<br>other site and so forth so it<br>it does a number of different tasks<br>writing as I'm sort of defining it here<br>is just one but it tends to be primary<br>because again<br>writing becomes like gameplay the site<br>by which or the means by which we are<br>testing a system to determine whether<br>it's intelligence because we can't quite<br>bring ourselves to have recourse to<br>abstractions like soul<br>any longer so the literary writing<br>becomes and it's especially literary<br>writing that becomes the means by<br>looking through whether there's<br>sentience right that Google engineer was<br>especially worried on the basis of its<br>world's feel it's capacity for feeling<br>and empathetic understanding but also<br>the the voice of the thing which called<br>thank you thank you just to follow up on<br>that and<br>so there's sort of become a recurring<br>online discourse in this opportunity<br>where they'll be often popular press<br>article but sometimes the scientists<br>themselves making very large claims<br>about sentience or<br>an AI coming to speak this was one<br>yesterday coming to speak to a<br>parliament or something like that and<br>then<br>linguists or other humanitarians um is<br>it Elaine Mitchell yours Washington<br>responding saying no you're over<br>interpreting it it's this is what's<br>actually going on<br>the speculative thing to finish on<br>doesn't seem to be a large community who<br>really sort of wants<br>AI to be people to be conscious to be<br>speaking like other Minds just to<br>speculate do<br>you why might that be why do we want<br>actual demands conversational AI does it<br>make actual demands yeah<br>I mean I I mean I'm partly being silly<br>but<br>um so there are a number of platforms<br>like there's one called replica there<br>there are many of these virtual friends<br>during covet of course there are many<br>therapists built on top of language<br>models Etc so you could answer you can<br>answer the question practically or<br>pragmatically to say there's a need for<br>sociality especially if we're all locked<br>away there's a shortage of therapists<br>we've had the scene with Eliza why not<br>you know reboot and and develop better<br>systems<br>um<br>that's one way to answer the question<br>um<br>but I do think that I do think there is<br>something to the idea that it's not an<br>actual it's like sociality without<br>without the demands of sociality without<br>the responsibilities of sociality<br>because you don't actually have to care<br>for your virtual pet or your Precision<br>AI<br>it doesn't require you really to<br>um<br>inconvenience yourself or sacrifice to<br>yourself in the way that other people<br>can maintain<br>or<br>so either that's the cynical view I<br>would like to be able to end on a butter<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
