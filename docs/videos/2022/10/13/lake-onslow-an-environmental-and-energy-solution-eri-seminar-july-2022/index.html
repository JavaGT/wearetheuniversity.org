However, we have an international obligation to play our part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A significant part of this will be through reduced carbon dioxide output, achieved via transitioning to greater use of energy from renewables. This will include using renewable-sourced electricity to replace fossil fuels for transport and for industrial heating. However, increased reliance on weather-impacted renewables brings with it concerns over both security of power supply and the potential for high electricity prices. Dry years with low hydro lake inflows pose a particular problem for the green transition. Dry periods are presently covered by additional power generated from thermal stations using coal or gas. However, this comes at the cost of high electricity prices and carbon dioxide emissions. The New Zealand government is presently funding investigations into using pumped storage at Lake Onslow (Central Otago) as an emission-free and price-stabilising alternative to provide the security needed for our green transition. Recognition of the energy storage potential of Lake Onslow and all associated published work to date derive from research carried out in the former Department of Earth & Ocean Sciences at the University of Waikato. The presentation will review the history of the Onslow pumped storage concept through to the recent government announcements. Looking to the future, an overview will be given of possible local environmental offsets as well as climate change drought insurance for the Taieri River in Otago.<br><br>Hon. Prof. Earl Bardsley has been recently involved with work following a proposal to use Lake Onslow (Central Otago) for energy storage by way of a large pumped storage scheme. Subject to a preliminary study, the New Zealand government has allocated $70 million for a detailed site investigation. This $4 billion project has the capability to provide a buffer against dry years for a transformed electricity-based economy with reduced emissions from transport and industrial heating. At the same time, the scheme will enable 100% renewable electricity, with constrained electricity prices, by 2030. If constructed, the Onslow scheme would represent a significant contribution by the University of Waikato toward reducing New Zealandâ€™s non-agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um<br>um<br>I guess you're going to be aware that<br>something is going on down the South<br>Island if you're just being sort of<br>looking at the medium but I've put in a<br>very small collection here of various<br>headlines which appeared on recently in<br>earlier on<br>um so the whole range of variations so<br>it makes other things it's been<br>suggested that um Onslow might even<br>cause the crashing the share processors<br>you<br>by the<br>helicopter<br>my Helm machine has completed a PhD on<br>Amazon Prime storage which I guess is<br>the definitive Works thus far<br>um yes the Moon is looking at um water<br>resources of environmental impact<br>sometimes though rather than on itself<br>and uh I'd like to give a personal<br>recognition here to Beyond farmers who I<br>know I've been impacted severely by the<br>indecision that's been going on around<br>that yeah whether or not as I was going<br>to advance or not<br>and hopefully I can meet them at some<br>stage and give a presentation<br>um Bradbury and Alexandra it's pretty<br>so<br>much<br>okay so this is the outline of the<br>presentation I'll go through some basics<br>of pump storage on those students that<br>give misconceptions and what's happening<br>between growing years mostly I'll be<br>talking about the Onslow climate change<br>in the environment so it was like the<br>other men's thesis was all about to wind<br>up with the emissions of the school as<br>well<br>um okay just a quick revision about pump<br>storage is all about yeah<br>basic idea is that you um buy a power<br>when it's cheap to pump water up when<br>you run it back down you sell them at<br>the end of that exercise of course there<br>will be a net injury and hopefully there<br>was a bit yeah<br>this is an indicative typical pump<br>storage scheme they're usually pretty<br>big but recently opened um pump storage<br>came over in Switzerland is that line<br>down there 900 megawatts<br>cost 3 billion good 14 years how to<br>construct sometimes I would rather<br>similar probably will be rather similar<br>but the unnoticeable difference between<br>you can see here the storage capacity 20<br>gigawatt hours to the express facility<br>5000 gigawatt hours and that's pretty<br>dramatic yeah<br>so the way of though obtains that<br>additional energy is by the combination<br>of high altitude and also a large<br>operating range for a lower level of 700<br>meters<br>um uh number a mile we'll come back to<br>it later and probably going up to around<br>about 765 meters that's a 65 meter<br>operating range as compared to 10 meters<br>on a typical Hydro Lake in the South<br>Island yeah<br>this is the effect it would have so the<br>lift bar there represents the current<br>Hydro storage capacity in New Zealand<br>Market which is in the south island and<br>the right bar is how much it would<br>change by if we added onto that one to<br>the max if that in half energy storage<br>capacity will give us the storage buffer<br>over a future dry Cam and cladding<br>plants<br>it's actually pretty simple you pump<br>water backwards on boards from the cook<br>River up to Lake underwear so those two<br>lines there the blue is the lower level<br>and the yellow is the upper Rebels and<br>the uh the water is always available<br>from the river you'll never use the same<br>water plus so there's no lower Reservoir<br>in that sense well in terms of it might<br>be a longer a longer tunnel through to<br>the lake Rochester<br>luckily the cliff river is the largest<br>quite slow so there's always going to be<br>on the Whipple forecast you will see two<br>jobs<br>and Onslow is the lift of those two<br>drops<br>yeah where is it going I guess your<br>first public recognition of Onslow was a<br>little note that I wrote back in 2005<br>and looking at the potential of the<br>thumb storage<br>um the back then the electricity bomb<br>was pretty aesthetic it wasn't growing<br>and there was no suggestion of ending<br>thermal um our generation and the Devils<br>I was constructed that would reduce<br>address still somewhat and that's how<br>things more or less stayed right through<br>to 2019 and that's when the things<br>change in terms of the imperatives and<br>the emissions reduction that then became<br>a new priority which was not even<br>thought about that in 2005. so the<br>interim climate change committee picked<br>up on the between of India storage like<br>antler as a way towards enabling us to<br>pretty pretty in July the government put<br>that in this part of its uh election<br>priority and groups of September that<br>actually brought that board a little bit<br>in the sense of bringing forward the<br>time of 100 Renewable Power to 2030<br>based on envo being able to reconstruct<br>it and today that they put a total of<br>about 100 million dollars mostly towards<br>Lake Onslow revisions sorry reviews<br>um<br>having a static electricity the mind is<br>going to change dramatically going into<br>the future because we're going to move<br>through the green transition to using<br>health history particularly for<br>industrial heat and transport so things<br>are changing<br>and the new power is going to come from<br>into mythical generation particularly<br>women created and that's when Onslow is<br>going to come into its own being able to<br>back up when it also of course take us<br>through a dry year because we still get<br>is not there and we go through to our<br>green transition we're going to have<br>massive spill of wind and water in wet<br>years<br>and where are we now oh well as of July<br>7. um the statement came out from the<br>government was passed through technical<br>um visibility which is<br>missile technical feasibility it's still<br>going on and on August 10 Megan Woods<br>stated that I'm scheduled to report back<br>the cabinet in December 2022 and that<br>report will get going through that<br>complete feasibility analysis of so<br>that's where things understand we<br>probably won't hear a lot more about it<br>until maybe early in the next year<br>there are other dry year alternative<br>storms though under investigation and so<br>we have to ask the question there<br>whether or not um was going to go ahead<br>the alternative fixable geothermal and<br>biomass<br>I don't sell either of those working<br>really because flexible with your<br>thermal it's almost like a contraction<br>of tune geothermalism not flexible and<br>I'm the way of the constant rate but I<br>meant to be very expensive that means<br>effectively a pile of wood apparently<br>and I don't see that those two options<br>can do very much between drawing<br>the other one being looked at is<br>hydrogen the two options now there<br>there's green hydrogen and interruptible<br>large-scale systems in itself just to<br>explain that<br>okay the left one first is the hydrogen<br>storage option<br>so the idea is simply be made green<br>hydrogen for Greenhouse pressure in<br>normal years we store the green hydrogen<br>and the dry air through it convert the<br>green hyd<br>ra<br>now that's a monster right from the very<br>beginning the witnessed this if you a<br>lot of thousand taken what else is<br>to offset the inefficiency it's never<br>going to happen but for some reason it's<br>the other option is uh assuming that Ty<br>still um is going to get still be with<br>us there's a large hydrogen plant in<br>itself now so there's going to be<br>powered by a large uh<br>in our normal year<br>um those wind farms will provide the<br>power that will be hydrogen or perhaps<br>for exported green hydrogen and in a dry<br>year they switch around you can turn off<br>the hydrogen plant and feed into the<br>National Grid it sounds sensible and<br>reliable but it's enough<br>there is that you're relying on the wind<br>blowing in Southland to take you through<br>all the countries through a dry year and<br>again they're just simply a terroristic<br>talking about summarize Megan Woods said<br>to keep the lights on in the future we<br>will either<br>needle plan or develop a solution for<br>storing a large amount of renewable<br>energy<br>yeah a bunch of misconceptions are<br>around<br>energy increase in two ways creating a<br>small energy gain for reduced Hydra<br>spell and a large energy gained by<br>enabling wind power<br>level increased transmission loss I know<br>it won't because it's just sample your<br>story when like the cake it was raised<br>there was no increase in transmission<br>because it neither would there be an<br>increasing transmission loss um by<br>raising like<br>what are those in the wrong Island no<br>it's not it has to be in the South<br>Island because the south island is where<br>the hardware Lakes are and the role of<br>Onslow is to buffer the South Island<br>Hydraulics if you had owned level on<br>North Island that would mean when you<br>had a wet year in the South Island<br>you've got to get all that extra power<br>followed competing with the other with<br>our movement through the clock cable<br>bottleneck so that would never work<br>um the biggest bear well that's<br>sometimes true certainly the client damn<br>one of the thing big projects is<br>definitely bad should never be built on<br>the other hand they're more damn another<br>big one that's an asset to the country<br>one of our most important car<br>Generations<br>instead<br>um that's not going to happen either<br>because no one's going to accept a large<br>Dam in a valley anymore in New Zealand<br>and the other thing paradoxically the<br>more damage you build the greater the<br>dry year risk because all it means is<br>you're going to have more turbines doing<br>nothing in a dry year so the impact will<br>be great<br>another one that comes out sometimes<br>it's all technology it's something<br>better will come along sometimes perhaps<br>maybe but who wants to take the risk of<br>that it's much better to stick with<br>something that you know and not have<br>some sort of opium concept that<br>everything will come right by technology<br>and also there's a concept that onto the<br>commercial operation requires saving<br>hard drives but in fact that's<br>irrelevant to Onslow commercial<br>operations in the sense of buying<br>achieving selling more expensive it<br>doesn't come in time<br>okay this is an important figure because<br>it sort of illustrates how Enzo would<br>interact with the environment now I<br>understand just keep in mind it's going<br>to be generally recommended power is<br>expensive and buying pumping when power<br>is cheaper so it will establish a silly<br>when processors get high once I will<br>start doing writing a couple of the<br>probe prices going in the further up<br>so the idea is that Upper price ceiling<br>will mean that you'll never get into a<br>situation of requiring coal or gas<br>simply because it would be uneconomical<br>um to generate a couple of gas at that<br>price ceiling the lowering by having a<br>price floor that will be greatly assist<br>um one generation the paradoxical thing<br>about wind generation if the wind is not<br>blowing obviously you can't generate<br>income the spins blowing everywhere you<br>still can't generate anything the reason<br>for that is the wind can't be stored you<br>have to dump it out of the electricity<br>so if we go back I think that was 29th<br>of July<br>you can see those<br>um costs figures there<br>the um the megawatt hour was going for<br>two cents that's that's not a kilowatt<br>hour which are you you're which is your<br>home you know this is a megawatt hour so<br>you're not going to make much money from<br>boom selling your electricity and<br>getting back two cents per megawatt hour<br>so the price more would make wind<br>generation much more reliable and and<br>and more predictable so hopefully<br>they will enable when to develop much<br>more than otherwise would have done by<br>the way on this particular day there was<br>200 cubics of worth of flow available<br>for pumping that translates to about a<br>thousand big ones so if you would have<br>been a thousand megawatts into that<br>system on that day you would find for<br>hey likewise you mentioned about the<br>ceiling back in 2010 the electricity<br>price shown here in red uh was quite<br>high and coal burning ramped up to meet<br>that price then Along come some heavy<br>rain the price went down and cold<br>burning faded away again but the thing<br>is as far as I was going that high price<br>would never come in the first place and<br>Huntley would never have started playing<br>guitar<br>you could also get um low prices even<br>without one so here's a situation uh a<br>few days back we're gonna be in Cyclone<br>over the country there's a big low<br>coming in that's causing rain right now<br>on the west coast the prices lived there<br>too even though there was no no wind<br>generation about four dollars per<br>megawatt hour but that's simply because<br>there was a big peak and the the content<br>of hydraulics you can see they jumped up<br>here I wouldn't mind betting over the<br>next few days it'll jump up even further<br>as the water flows the club's gone<br>okay this is a common headline you see<br>around the place and I always find a<br>little bit upsetting there are six ways<br>you'd help with climate change the thing<br>is this gives you a whole sense of<br>empowerment I rode around in your<br>bicycle or whatever and you will have<br>some effect on New Zealand weather and<br>climate well it just doesn't work like<br>that we're living in a global system<br>Global atmosphere and Global ocean so<br>you can pedal around as much as you like<br>but you're not going to understand for<br>anything in terms of the deals with a<br>new climate and that graph is going to<br>keep on going up quite a long time<br>somebody said that we do need to be<br>responsible citizens of course but we<br>also need to consider our own well-being<br>and focus on what we actually can<br>control<br>so<br>yeah so the green uh the green<br>transition<br>um<br>and click on scroll down<br>High floating meeting controls<br>okay so we need to focus on what we can<br>control the the climate change which is<br>effectively uh climate change and have<br>pressure so we need to realize those<br>climate changes come in whether we like<br>it or not<br>we can modify ourselves but to some<br>extent in order to actually keep our<br>environment a little bit better under<br>control and also importantly we need to<br>have the green Foundation giving us a<br>somewhat better environment but that<br>might even mean backing away from some<br>existing Renewables<br>now aren't I can contribute to this at<br>the original<br>just last week the government announced<br>this climate change at a passion<br>National plan now of course that's going<br>to be largely on the whole country part<br>of that<br>um actually 8.2 3.3<br>um if the managed dry year risk and the<br>dry air risk has been stated the current<br>focus is on the feasibility of pumping<br>hydraulic thrusting that Blake on<br>something so that's good but importantly<br>like Andre could also come into<br>operation at the original level then<br>we'll have a look at that particularly<br>with respect to the risk factor which<br>they noted before which was the list of<br>all right let's just leave them do it um<br>we're going to take the adaptation<br>possible future proofing of the Dunedin<br>City Urban water supply now on our East<br>Coast that we're predicted to have drier<br>conditions going into the future in<br>Napier and Dunedin are going to be<br>particularly vulnerable but I just<br>haven't got Christchurch there because<br>that has a large river nearby which was<br>now of course we're all aware that if a<br>city heads towards zero wardrobe Supply<br>it's pretty serious business and you'll<br>probably recall haptown a few years back<br>when there was a worry that there was a<br>day Zero coming up where we would have<br>run out of water policely they didn't<br>but nonetheless if you gave you an<br>indication of what could happen<br>and it really is<br>ah<br>wards<br>okay<br>on the bigger picture the supply Point<br>itself comes from not a long Railway the<br>web here in Deep Creek and there's a<br>pipeline taking all the way down to go<br>to underneath water uses about 8.5 Q mix<br>the um uh which doesn't seem a lot I<br>don't know on the other hand if you<br>don't have it you've got to be quite<br>serious they um they've raised the point<br>of what would happen if we were<br>production of having drier some summer<br>flows<br>but I clearly by the way is okay because<br>it's beside the river which comes on the<br>okay well we've got an indication what<br>could happen to the leading water supply<br>um in just a couple of years back when<br>there's a fire in the water supply and<br>they had to cut off deep stream for a<br>while<br>um for water quality reasons and that<br>meant to a lot of hope it was of high<br>pressure in the higher than anything<br>so certainly if you combine that with an<br>even bigger drought there's some<br>okay so let's go to the intake point<br>of the water supply there it is there's<br>the pipe getting up towards Dunedin<br>Thomas where and up there on that bottom<br>line there's a 700 meter elevation<br>hopefully they actually ring a bell for<br>my earliest life<br>and<br>so this is like oh I'm slow where wood<br>people was raised up there's the Big<br>Creek didn't take so there's a<br>possibility here for putting in a narrow<br>17 kilometer panel going through and<br>they're correct as an emergency water<br>supply for Dunedin in the worst case<br>scenario if it happens that the large<br>enough drought caused the VIPs cream to<br>dry up by the way we couldn't get it<br>from the Logan bin Reservoir that's just<br>a very shallow Reservoir it doesn't hold<br>very much water maybe this is a test for<br>three Waters looking into the future<br>keep in mind that of course we pump that<br>water up all the way from the river up<br>into one's like it's going to be<br>expensive water so hopefully as part of<br>envelope should it go ahead will be some<br>kind of a emergency water quota which<br>will give you a limited amount of water<br>during extreme drought events um without<br>okay here's the second one what's the<br>possibility of drought mitigation at um<br>in the tire river the tari river in<br>otago part of a dog League that's up<br>here in the highlands of a central otago<br>it works its way North occasions back<br>and eventually flows out of tire mouth<br>south of Dunedin there's a flow gauge<br>here up in Canadian flat but that's<br>about the only flow gauge which isn't<br>impacted by drawers further Upstream so<br>we'll come back to that shortly let's<br>have a quick tour first down the tire<br>river just to give you a sort of feeling<br>of what it looks like<br>a lot of irrigation takes place on the<br>in the upper and middle portions here's<br>the Third River over there the belt and<br>all of this is irrigated land they're<br>using water attacking from the turret so<br>you can appreciate there's an awful lot<br>to lose there that Atari was to try out<br>the central portions going through some<br>of the ranges very attractive depending<br>through the the dry rough Ridge Country<br>over here<br>and some of you may have gone on the<br>otago train through the Prairie Gorge<br>rainfall coming through to it if you<br>look at the hydrograph if there's no<br>rain the fire falls away or fairly<br>rapidly so it doesn't have very much<br>baseball support<br>that raises the question though given<br>this medium flooded around about say a q<br>mix could a drought be so intense as to<br>cause an acumet River totally dry out<br>more it sounds like a bit like a<br>Enlightenment but that might be able to<br>be experienced right now over in in<br>France it's a little river pump would<br>have to go correctly and presently that<br>River has absolutely no water going on<br>and the words it's unprecedented comes<br>out and that those two words probably<br>sum up a lot of what's going on on<br>climate change the past is not<br>necessarily a very good um predictor of<br>okay but now let's just go ahead and do<br>a standard extreme value analysis of low<br>flow using that Canadian flat flow gauge<br>now just the clarification here the<br>vertical axis is sort of upside down it<br>measures the discharge as the percentage<br>below the median flow in other words<br>that percentage was 100 that means the<br>river has dried up so bit points means<br>low flow<br>so by and large the theory if it's more<br>or less well I can fit an extreme value<br>curve quite nicely through that data and<br>it looks like it's telling up to some<br>sort of an upper bound as the extreme<br>value Theory would would suggest<br>so that's the same that on average we're<br>going to have these big events or big<br>lower events<br>um maybe around about 30 years on<br>average so perhaps there's nothing too<br>much to worry about in terms of climate<br>change but Michael Yes<br>matching doesn't always validate the<br>theory so let's take that data and plot<br>it again as a Time series<br>and we see in fact that there's a trend<br>in there so the basic idea of extreme<br>value analysis is that every year is<br>just an independent event but on the<br>other hand that is pretty not the case<br>so even though 1999 Remains the lowest<br>below if you extrapolated on Apple to<br>the Future it might not be enough about<br>or be a lower bound the flow so that's<br>there appears to be something of a<br>change the lower uh rainfall also around<br>that general area<br>yeah so happens that the top of the<br>tower Headwater is not very far from<br>Lake Angela so we can potentially pull<br>that tunnel trigger Cube but in this<br>case it's much shorter maybe a short<br>three kilometer tunnel linking the upper<br>the expanded like envelope to a<br>tributary of the tari river and we could<br>keep that tunnel as a backup against a<br>really heavy drought and batari and<br>Atari River again you need to have some<br>sort of a quota because that would<br>otherwise be extensive one so I'm not<br>saying you should actually go ahead to<br>let water go through because there are<br>important water quality implications to<br>this thing I.E just Dynamo in the Clue<br>the river and you'll be introducing<br>little mo into the Atari which would be<br>something of a tragedy but nonetheless<br>what we need to do if one of their goes<br>ahead is to have this tunnel put in and<br>put a big valve at the other end and<br>that at least will give future<br>Generations the option of having that<br>water should they so choose to do so if<br>we don't put them before Ohm's lab was<br>okay well all of ourselves of course is<br>going to have some significant<br>environmental impact probably the<br>largest of which is flooding these Local<br>web names the Blue Line represents the<br>new lightning in its lowest possible<br>level that's the 700 meter level a lot<br>of crowd lots of solitude it's a<br>beautiful quiet place up there it also<br>there's the probability of a large dry<br>roll down exposing<br>lots of ram which was previously<br>underwater<br>okay so we need to have some offsets but<br>I want to argue we need to offset much<br>more things otago will sell them than<br>the local environmental impacts of um so<br>I'm not taking you through a product<br>overview of what has already happened in<br>terms of environmental impacts that<br>attacking yourself and respect the hard<br>drive<br>and we've got 57 kilometers of stumps<br>Brown trees all over the place for four<br>kilometers four megawatts and that's a<br>really major environmental impact that<br>we could do without because a little bit<br>more closely like how a loco just next<br>door typical field man Lake beautiful<br>beaches trees on the back I wonder what<br>used to look like this this is what<br>modern wire looks like now just brown<br>stuff<br>the pictures are still here they're<br>submerged by personal time but they're<br>down there probably in this case<br>but<br>probably many in the room haven't heard<br>of the impact of the way our River so<br>I'd like to give you a kind of a waikato<br>analogy<br>let's suppose you work out one morning<br>and found waikato River had been reduced<br>to a small muddy stream forever Hawker<br>Falls have no water because aluminum is<br>melter did Auckland giving a bit of<br>local employment in Lake tap I was being<br>saved you're supposed to be grateful for<br>that<br>that's effectively what happened in the<br>way<br>so this is a chart showing the<br>hydrological impact these are minimum<br>flows what so that's before the manipuri<br>power station and that's after a<br>dramatic impact the biggest single<br>impact that we have for a New Zealand<br>River people say oh there's the save<br>manipuri campaign was a great success it<br>was it was a failure because it failed<br>to predict the way I revealed was just<br>so this is the wire River now if you<br>want<br>um and where's it gone it's been a<br>better of course down a hole to make a<br>they're called Green aluminum<br>um<br>it was once one of our largest and<br>cleanest rivers in fact it was our<br>second largest river by discharge after<br>the cruise line<br>and that has human impact just recently<br>there's been a delegation went up to so<br>don't forget our River has definitely<br>got much chance of changing it and uh<br>but that's an ongoing issue so the lower<br>flows of course be warmer water Ogle<br>blooms and so forth<br>not a good look at all<br>just going around I was crumble<br>everybody knows about crumble it's a<br>nice track goes through there but of<br>course you come together<br>I'm like how where it was flooded the<br>older people still remember how it<br>looked as you can see there there are a<br>few who can still remember what<br>so this green here I've shown on the map<br>that's the land areas that were flooded<br>there's a consequence of late now we are<br>being raised the blue is like how weird<br>as it was before it was funneled and up<br>here was origin of the forests of the<br>hunter River now you can still see the<br>forests if you go<br>together or at least they're very<br>so again there has been lots of impacts<br>around the otago south region<br>the ups and downs are how we're rubber<br>disclosing operation and cut away the<br>rubber Shoreline in many places could<br>you imagine the Uproar that would take<br>place that had been done as comfortable<br>in consequence of gold mine but because<br>it wasn't gold money we're allowed to do<br>it because simply water going up and<br>down hey we need to have storage and we<br>do I'm not going to knock it we didn't<br>have storage in those Hydraulics we<br>wouldn't be able to keep the lights on<br>the North Island during winter<br>but also hopefully will change<br>the hallway river which drains out of<br>Lake how we're mad fluctuation<br>percentage was and you can see it go up<br>and down all the time and contact you to<br>do this in order to try to balance up<br>its limited water storage here if I'm<br>like oh yeah I'm about to outside right<br>there<br>waitaki River that's the second most<br>impacted River in the South Island<br>what's happened there is that by holding<br>water back and be like you take a bow on<br>puke the seasonal variation of the well<br>okay no way thank you because being<br>virtually eliminated so the red line is<br>how it is now the blue line is how it<br>used to be and of course there's issues<br>there with water quality and so forth<br>there was a move it's a while back to<br>actually lower the sum of those even<br>further<br>for the cultural dimension of all this<br>too the New Zealand government is<br>presently Consulting with natahu<br>concerning the onslowente right but I<br>would really question whether or not who<br>were ever consultant<br>like our real Forest so lots of flowers<br>and the waitaki river and the<br>distraction of the way our River I'm<br>okay well that's by way of background<br>now at least to some extent we could be<br>able to use Onslow if we built it to<br>reverse some of this damage so I'll<br>raise the issue here of corporate good<br>citizenship<br>should the power companies really be<br>chasing the last megawatt the last drop<br>of the turbines always maximize the<br>income to the shareholders so the<br>shareholders want nothing more from the<br>company then increase the difference<br>The Late Model way take contributes<br>nothing to water pressure so it only has<br>a seasonal effect to modifying the<br>storage place so I would just raise the<br>question perhaps Pioneer Energy<br>cooperate the Onslow of scheme could<br>lower the leg back to its original left<br>after three planting the visual line<br>part I guess the Big Cabin credits<br>involved with that and okay except some<br>seasonal income Lots there is notify<br>connection indirectly here too because<br>Pioneer Energy also owns some<br>palatations Downstream of Lake Onslow<br>and the spill on it so a great big Dam<br>right here to eliminate the spell of the<br>pioneer stations further down the river<br>so hopefully I don't know it may just be<br>a possibility that we could reverse and<br>save the uh like we want to go back to<br>the way it used to be<br>oops<br>most of the wet weather rain is over<br>here on the West Coast so clear the<br>river gains its flow from how we want to<br>get<br>the least flow comes from Lake how weird<br>because it started us to the east there<br>are two major power stations here that<br>Clyde Dam and the Roxborough deck the<br>only storage control is because we're<br>the least water comes out the lake how<br>we're that's why it's going to be worked<br>so hard in order to actually be of some<br>use to the Clyde dam in the Roxbury Dam<br>hello two dams we call them and like<br>Dustin and uh<br>but because the only control is coming<br>out of like aware and it still means<br>that contact Energy will operate these<br>stations have limited seasonal control<br>over the water going through these two<br>stations<br>okay so let's just have a quick look at<br>the hydrology of the service stations<br>now the the blue represents the actual<br>flows and the orange flows without how<br>we are stored note how different this is<br>from the waitaki because you haven't got<br>that big storage upstream and the scales<br>here are the same so what you see here<br>is that the winter flows uh lower in the<br>spring flows are higher but the spring<br>flows there's the time of lower shelter<br>now contact does its best to lower the<br>spring flows a bit and increase the<br>winter flows a bit because that<br>optimizes income but it doesn't it's not<br>very much different really the biggest<br>thing would be if they go as it is there<br>will be a much lower supplier price at<br>the time of Springfield so that means<br>that the highest prices or these higher<br>prices will come in at the time of<br>greatest discharge and that represents<br>an income gain so the hydrology and the<br>and the actual commercial aspects are<br>so it could be restored well because<br>it has talked from time to time about<br>putting a small power station on the<br>they like how weird damage has raised<br>right now<br>um we also have to give up those ups and<br>downs not the control of the Hawaii<br>River I showed you previously in the<br>detail I'm just mentioning this in case<br>this recording gets down to the south<br>island people get concerned but like low<br>would be lowered by increment to avoid<br>dust issues we'd have to make allowance<br>for just the irrigation so there's no<br>loss of water supply we would need to<br>replant uh the underground fireworks now<br>there's a lot in that but it's something<br>okay this has to get really interesting<br>now the wire River could we actually do<br>something about that what's happening<br>now well you're probably saying on the<br>headlines about talking about a giant<br>hydrogen plant in Southland and by the<br>look of it the aluminum smell was going<br>to stay open they're an undergoing<br>negotiations now I can't imagine<br>brilliant giving it up then we'll get<br>more money for it but I'm sure table<br>white point will continue on<br>so the hydrogen plant is going to come<br>from a large wind energy resource now<br>there is a very large one in your<br>resource in the southern south I should<br>know because I'm the person who<br>discovered<br>so okay there's a quick explanation of<br>this graph this was my paper I wrote way<br>back in 1980s now this is invercargill<br>airport as you go up these numbers<br>represent the windy energy flux at<br>different levels so this is a thousand<br>watts per square meter and that there's<br>500 watts per square meter now when you<br>can compare Christchurch and<br>invercargill you'll see that that's<br>Contours uh much closer to the ground<br>they're doing invercargill airport and<br>importantly the gradient is not great so<br>this is telling you if you put in giant<br>wind turbines in favo straight up maybe<br>well next about 200 meters how high that<br>will get a maximum amount of energy<br>coming out of the wind it's a very large<br>resource<br>okay so let's reword the water energy<br>balance in the South Island you can see<br>what we can do with that<br>but okay this is a busy diagram so I<br>hope you've got time to go over it yeah<br>right let's start off with the<br>environmental let's make<br>there's the wire of a flow now let's<br>increase the minimum output from Lake<br>manipuri from 16 Q mix right up to 125<br>cubits so that pretty much reverts the<br>way our flow to about half what it was<br>before probably something like that<br>excellent protection<br>okay so that means would possibly pay<br>for that we have to reduce output from<br>the mandatory power supply I.E you have<br>to cut down two other Seven Generations<br>you only have five and keep those two<br>and emergency Reserve that means a loss<br>of about 170 megawatts of power<br>all right now this is where our Wind<br>Farm comes<br>now a giant Wind Farm of course as<br>Windows always is it's intermittent but<br>if you can buy a wonderful a large wind<br>farm with envelope that represents a<br>really massive power power system just<br>as big or bigger than manipura you've<br>got the energy from the wind and the<br>stability<br>so I would argue that you can instead of<br>the two together it's 100 renewable but<br>more than that it's 100 reliable because<br>we've got onload to pick up the womb<br>now that means for example that the Ty<br>aluminum spell it can keep going through<br>a drawing it personally when a dryer<br>comes along they better turn down pod<br>lines now that's got to be worth<br>something to reach into because when the<br>prices are high they want when the<br>aluminum prices are high they want to go<br>out and produce as much aluminum as they<br>can<br>okay so the rest of the power coming<br>from this combo plant onto the past<br>south of wind energy can go to a<br>southern industry maybe green hydrogen<br>and into the National Group which helps<br>us with our green transition<br>so in other words we're rearranging the<br>Renewables and making a partial<br>transition from water power to wind<br>power in the South but I would argue<br>also that Rio tento should consider<br>contributing to the the confession cost<br>um so a call out to brilliant contact we<br>agenda if they're seeing this recording<br>do the right thing<br>I think it's possible it's just a<br>question of having the right mindset and<br>again this comes back down to corporate<br>responsibility is it all about getting<br>the last megawatt getting the last<br>dollar there's got to be more two of<br>them<br>yeah yeah on the other hand the previous<br>uh slide live generator bit of<br>controversy on the why can't wait<br>revisit that with respect to one so<br>everybody wins we don't need to change<br>anything because the effective answers<br>are coming into the market will be that<br>we can actually level out the prices<br>seasonally there's no need to have that<br>big seasonal storage anymore so when the<br>water gets high your life stick won't be<br>okay the price of getting low large<br>level pump and then we'll take it back<br>down to mid-level and vice versa I've<br>got the levels so these extremes of<br>spill that we might have next week and<br>low levels will largely be a thing as<br>the past at least much reduced and of<br>course spill that represents income loss<br>to Meridian<br>so everybody would win on their seats<br>both in terms of the environment and in<br>terms of the actual um uh commercial<br>aspects just put a number on it<br>they've also have been operating back in<br>2009 that was a practically wet period<br>beginning of a particularly wet period<br>there was around about 5000 gigawatt<br>hours lost the spillage so that<br>represents the entire energy storage<br>capacity of Lake Armstrong it also<br>represents a large amount of money<br>because if I have been operational<br>that's the amount would have been lost<br>by taking power so that's the economic<br>half of the equation the environmental<br>half is that the ups and downs of Lake<br>perkaki which are much less so the blue<br>is what actually happened the red what<br>would have happened it falls over being<br>operational in the matter again we're<br>not changing anything we're suddenly<br>saying too brilliant do what's best in<br>terms of for you in terms of the market<br>and this is what the outcome would be<br>and of course we would have like<br>um bouquet not so much High anymore<br>causing that erosion and that would<br>apply to Hydraulics up and down the<br>country so once I was going to have a<br>big impact if it goes ahead in there it<br>seems<br>but also let's get back to the info<br>specific one there is going to be some<br>local environmental impacts for sure now<br>we have a big operating range I would<br>certainly like to see soil removed over<br>the operating range otherwise it was<br>drawn right down we don't have mastery<br>it wouldn't look nice at all<br>and I couldn't really get a picture of<br>what I might look like at low levels but<br>this picture of Lake Midge is some sort<br>of a sense of it there's the high level<br>that's going down and you had the idea<br>is to have a bare rock exposed not soil<br>getting blown all over the place and if<br>you sort of use your imagination right<br>down there you just saw kind of a sense<br>here's a little bit of a beer I could<br>expose on the present day times so if<br>you extrapolate that up over 30 meters<br>which equivalent to around about 35<br>square kilometers<br>that's roughly how it might look<br>hopefully it will never happen we're<br>building more and more wind all the time<br>we might not have even need to go down<br>that path<br>nothing we could do it's the landscape<br>the Onslow per stand for this around<br>yeah I've got the paper just a couple of<br>days ago because the suggestion went out<br>we could use concrete to build a deck<br>well there's a few reasons against them<br>but what of course big pile of concrete<br>will be terrible it's going to generate<br>a lot of emissions it's a bad luck to<br>actually go ahead like that but also<br>there's a possibility even though we<br>need a much bigger volume it's a bit<br>more expensive we're making this then we<br>couldn't maybe he just maybe building a<br>hotter and trucks from hydrogly next to<br>the generator at Lake Onslow itself<br>wouldn't it be great for building a dam<br>with renewable energy<br>and just think of the international<br>recognition they would get we will first<br>down<br>right but we certainly don't want them<br>looking like like bimbo they're grabbing<br>massive things like that which screamed<br>out at you this was a damn it doesn't<br>it's not a possibility I wish they could<br>create a second like answer<br>um but purely it's a natural light now<br>it might sound kind of a contradiction<br>in terms to say a natural man-made look<br>but what we would do is simply put a dam<br>right there and that would create a I<br>like the quads because I've learned but<br>almost and we could put that whole<br>catchment into a Upland Reserve now that<br>that name would have no valves on them<br>they would just act as if it was a<br>landslide and in fact that's what<br>happened dozens of years ago like why<br>caramana it was created by a landslide<br>and it's a beautiful way we could do the<br>same on a smaller scale by creating<br>another Lake up here now what's going to<br>happen one of the things about the<br>fishing issues at Lake owns isn't the<br>theory of so much about the loss of<br>visibility it's going to be the<br>environment<br>people will know for sure that just as<br>important as the fresh body is the<br>environment that you're in so I can't<br>guarantee better fishing in the new Lake<br>area but for sure it would be a much<br>better environment it would be peaceful<br>we would have the same degree of<br>solitude it's like Onslow who doesn't<br>know in that in the due course and<br>wetlands would develop around the<br>glacial lines and we could have this<br>whole Upland Reserve to preserve some of<br>just a very quick one here doesn't mean<br>much to you one offset also could be the<br>government might instead of building a<br>higher Dam to enable summer clothes to<br>be higher than the many Heritage River<br>any hurricane river flows into the<br>Clover River<br>um Alexandra but it separates it's a<br>it's a contentious issue right now<br>because it's so low there's a lot of<br>irrigation Pace going off and one<br>possibility it could be that the<br>government could there's an obviously<br>it's going to build a higher Dam up it<br>falls down up on that menu here at your<br>head waters but he never would hold back<br>for a spring flood and release the water<br>during the summer offsetting those<br>rather awkward looking situations where<br>we have the weed growing over at times<br>of low flow of the summer but just<br>purely a gift effectively by the<br>government from about Target whether<br>they would do it or not I don't know but<br>it's worth mentioning anyway<br>so anticipating some questions<br>what about the very rare about very<br>impactful driving in other words what<br>about two dry years in Europe how about<br>look at our security of water supply oh<br>power supply if we have 100 renewable<br>hours<br>and anyway where will the initial energy<br>of Terror Waters come from from rising<br>well I first wrote the paper back in<br>2005. I considered extending over into<br>the upper management<br>and it's possible by putting in a couple<br>of little damages up here what happened<br>here you couldn't buy just simply by<br>local streams coming in you could build<br>up a lot of considerable energy reserves<br>it's largely like tapa it might even be<br>as bigger than one terawatt hour in<br>terms of storage but the critical thing<br>is to give yourself the option of having<br>that sometime in the future you have to<br>build it before you raised like orange<br>generation<br>I would argue it would be rather better<br>to keep the like subject or before I got<br>permissions around about the metal level<br>so that means that you have this Reserve<br>about 280 gigawatt hours just in case<br>something goes wrong and you need some<br>power and a hurricane<br>so that in the senses at least partially<br>the backup of secure your supply up for<br>the Northern Ireland you haven't done<br>too low then you're going to be packing<br>away that security of Supply if you have<br>a way out why then that runs a risk of<br>maybe you're flooding and spill bad so<br>back in 1999 we had a major at 198. we<br>had a major spill in the waikato river<br>and I thought they could be lower but it<br>might not have happened<br>so again that's uh a new way of<br>operating just a reminder the bedroom<br>the Bedford reforms didn't allow for 100<br>Renewable Power yeah so effectively<br>we're taking<br>um<br>Mercury will be angry about this but<br>nonetheless we're taking the Tapo Lake<br>taupo out of the system in terms of a<br>normal operating hydraulic but they<br>write a good Other Nation maybe<br>okay initial energy well with luck if we<br>strike a wait time it could come from<br>reduced<br>spell loss<br>um we might even have a public power<br>savings campaign previous game pass<br>Evans campaign have reduced I'll just<br>use about that 10.<br>or indirectly we could have maybe gas<br>fire power supply use some of the<br>satellite<br>so that's the best fish which will have<br>to be thought of be going into the<br>future should I say we have to recognize<br>there will be stranded assets the North<br>Island gas pipeline will no longer be<br>reliable and it's certainly pretty silly<br>use of pipeline if I put hydrogen into<br>it but it doesn't want to link there<br>will be<br>um mass movement recording precision and<br>so on much better than French quadril<br>100 through the National Grid you create<br>the hydrogen at the other ring at the<br>power station become also Australia<br>because it will prepare all of us will<br>at the frontier of transporting the way<br>we used to we managed and store our<br>energy storage by putting water up<br>Health that's sort of fun but they would<br>have put in a million dollars a funding<br>for that some of which actually come to<br>what do you think of it there's been 17<br>up to 100 million dollars spread on<br>Amazon so nothing at all on what's going<br>on around in terms of yes<br>so there's a little call out would be<br>nice maybe if somebody out there looking<br>at this as a recording if I consider<br>making a small donation spiritual<br>waikato University which will help to<br>keep our project going we have been a<br>little bit we've done<br>a paper on the elaboration loss and<br>without funding just to keep us going at<br>okay just finally the phone's low just<br>go ahead apparently it really will be a<br>mess I'm forecasting by this time next<br>year it will be concerned simply as an<br>engineering project it's huge if we<br>thought of as manipuri and Benmore put<br>together it doesn't look like it that's<br>it when you just see some Rolling Hills<br>and that that won't change all that very<br>much except the lake level will be that<br>much higher<br>um it'll it'll be the name of the<br>national level by enabling Renewable<br>Power stable through Dry years and that<br>in two will enable the green energy to<br>transition where we move towards<br>electrification of Transport or<br>industrial heating the biggest change of<br>energy we've ever had in New Zealand's<br>history and also in particular it will<br>enable the required Renewables until it<br>all happen particularly win<br>originally at that time going Southland<br>there will be potential player um<br>climate change adaptation Department of<br>religion and I would argue about my<br>nature a tub Thumper but really it would<br>be the greatest ever research<br>contribution to New Zealand but this<br>ever happened from any new University<br>that gives me a feeling of product yes<br>and even more so it will be an example<br>to the world or how intermittent<br>Renewables that can power Nation through<br>climate change some people are having a<br>big enough provider you've got the<br>geography storage thank you our service<br>constructed would give you something in<br>excess of 5000 gigawatt hours of storage<br>that would represent the order of about<br>half of the pair of energy storage by<br>pump storage over the whole world so<br>it's a big deal even global<br>I got a special role of a very School of<br>Science<br>is not very big we're in an average<br>University I guess in terms of scale and<br>it's really quite nice to think that a<br>little school sounds like ours could<br>actually have such a big role we don't<br>have to beg universities I visit to the<br>students you you can go ahead if you<br>make something useful from our research<br>which will have a lasting effect on the<br>nation far into the future<br>okay<br>I think we still have 10 minutes<br>thank you<br>um he's talking about<br>um<br>since<br>inclusively what do you have to consider<br>like about three months maybe<br>um but you I think divine's pretty<br>quickly your question is why couldn't we<br>use hydrogen uh<br>yes okay so the oh all right so you're<br>talking about the large hydrogen plant<br>and the in the South and South<br>um<br>well I'm a great believer in a hardware<br>in the sense of replacing these little<br>trucks I'm not against that at all but<br>in terms of modern storage uh take us<br>through a dry year in theory it is<br>possible I mean you could do it but the<br>real big thing is the inefficiency of<br>hydrogen using that green hydrogen back<br>to our electricity the usual loss is<br>greater than 50 so if you want to get<br>your 50 sorry your 5 000 terawatt hours<br>which we need for a drug you would need<br>another five thousand fear or what else<br>in other words ten thousand over the<br>other to offset the inefficiency of that<br>process going from the conversion of the<br>green altruistic back to green Al first<br>to deal with hydrogen as the<br>intermediate<br>does this inefficiency matter well<br>I mean I guess what it's called doesn't<br>affect the usual you've got to get the<br>money to produce people to turn one out<br>this is great<br>research contribution I would like to<br>see the university recognize this by<br>putting your name forward to the<br>National which is the government<br>effectively for the award of A Clean<br>um I'd like to say perhaps if this goes<br>ahead maybe the School of Science could<br>Rebrand itself as the school of applied<br>science just to emphasize that we're<br>we're can do kind of place<br>so my question is um if I read your<br>um<br>correctly you're sitting is there no<br>sometimes I've gone up to ridiculous<br>sometimes even negative well it's<br>interesting that there was no mechanism<br>to control the upper and lower price<br>because the emissions training scheme<br>the fundamental feature about that is<br>that the government sets are lower and<br>another price<br>permission was just working with the<br>2023 2027 and IT supplies to the<br>government that those upper republics<br>been raised<br>so just following up from that<br>what this would mean for the for the<br>large energy electricity generators is<br>that they would need fewer<br>staff in the working in the electricity<br>trading business<br>because because they would be much more<br>stability<br>and so if we think about that greater<br>stability you had occurred with the red<br>line that showed much less fluctuation<br>in price<br>what what would be the impact over say a<br>normal year<br>for the generator's income if<br>the scenario where we had that stability<br>advice or much racist because versus<br>their trading with their their<br>effectively like a<br>Forex Market where they're looking for<br>average I don't think would be that very<br>different<br>since I think that it wouldn't be all<br>that much change and in fact they might<br>even make a bit more money buy food with<br>saving a Spiller but if you lose 5 000<br>gigawatt hours it's spelled that's a<br>I mean actually what we do is make the<br>market more predictable<br>is that they can plan better yes and you<br>wouldn't have to take out forward<br>contracts like you're doing now is<br>hedging against a future dry year but<br>that will help industry<br>this would be the biggest shake-up in<br>the electricity I've seen sales<br>yes<br>and that would be a good thing but yeah<br>I think I generally speaking that would<br>be that would be well we're particularly<br>welcomed by The Big Industry users we<br>don't want to have to worry about what<br>the price will not be doing this year or<br>the electorate or whatever you have to<br>take out all the contractors<br>contracts to option do they cost money<br>because I hate people of course being<br>taken into account the risk in trying to<br>pay a lot more well there have been some<br>recent examples of failure with the<br>market<br>so yeah it would it would stabilize the<br>the previous head of Meridian it was<br>pretty strongly in favor of Oz lab for<br>that reason he said it's going to<br>introduce the building it's pretty much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
