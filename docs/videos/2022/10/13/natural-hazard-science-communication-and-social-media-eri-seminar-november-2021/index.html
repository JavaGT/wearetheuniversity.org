Is a megatsunami from the Canary Islands going to wipe out the US Eastern seaboard? Is Yellowstone going to end life on Earth? Should I evacuate my child from the area? Am I going to die? Identifying ourselves as experts in the online world and earning the trust of an audience provides great power that comes with great responsibility. Social media and global media interviews give us a voice like we have never had before, but we can do more damage than good if we are not careful. As experts we know more about our small areas of research than most and it is our collective duty to ensure that our science is translated for those who are interested, all the way to those who need it for life-saving decision making. Basic principles like kindness and compassion, working together, and especially listening, can guide us through the perils of science communication. This is a relatively new area for us all, and during events like eruptions from Indonesia to Hawai’i, Guatemala to Italy, we are learning as we go.<br><br>Janine Krippner is a physical volcanologist from New Zealand who uses remote sensing to study pyroclastic flows and is a well-known science communicator.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>okay<br>okay welcome to today's talk<br>um I'm very privileged we are very<br>privileged to have Dr Janine kripner<br>here with us today<br>um Janine was my very first Masters<br>student along with Roger Briggs she even<br>came to my job interview and interviewed<br>me in um I think you might have been in<br>in the office that my volcanology team<br>uh uh in at the moment and um so when I<br>finally arrived<br>um here was a master student ready to go<br>uh within a month we were being dragged<br>along to some lahars at ruapehu and then<br>a couple of months later I was being<br>dragged up to the top of Mount narahoe<br>um on my legs<br>um to explain it much longer<br>to get Janine started on on her master's<br>project she then went on and did a few<br>years at a petroleum company in Western<br>Australia but the call to volcanoes was<br>was<br>was very strong in Janine always has<br>been and so she ended up going to the<br>University of Pittsburgh to undertake a<br>PhD looking at some debris Avalanche<br>deposits and and related deposits at<br>Chevrolet<br>volcanoes which is in the Kamchatka<br>Peninsula does anyone know where the<br>Kamchatka Peninsula is<br>a few people here it's that one bit of<br>um land that juts out of the Far East of<br>Russia sort of comes down to Japan<br>eventually that's sort of part of the<br>Pacific Ring of Fire<br>but I guess<br>what made Janine<br>really bounce off in her career was an<br>eruption in Bali in 2017 the argong<br>eruption and she was just innocently uh<br>twittering a little bit about the<br>eruption and then it just kind of<br>cascaded into a big<br>um<br>eruption a big eruption and Janine got<br>caught up in as being one of the one of<br>the world's key science communicators<br>for this eruption and it just went on<br>from there I think you've had over about<br>200 media interviews and she's had<br>interviews with people like Neil<br>deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye to watch<br>documentaries on Netflix you'll you'll<br>know those people<br>um and then eventually following her PhD<br>she's landed a job at the Smithsonian<br>Institute<br>managing some of the volcano volcano<br>databases there<br>and um but covert has brought her home<br>so she's now working remotely<br>um but still with the Smithsonian<br>um that's enough of me now but I'm going<br>to pass on to Janine who's going to talk<br>about her experiences with uh volcanic<br>with her media and public engagement in<br>the last few years<br>thank you that was very nice payback for<br>me saying nice things during your job<br>interview<br>thank you everyone for coming thank you<br>everyone who is online as well for those<br>of you overseas<br>um our we went into alert level two of<br>the pandemic last night at midnight so<br>this was the very last minute scramble<br>of okay we can do this in person so<br>thank you very much for everyone being<br>here I really appreciate it<br>um as Adrian has just given a bit of a<br>synopsis<br>um if anyone out there is watching who's<br>kind of early career about to start<br>their career in University a lot of my<br>career has been on a single path I still<br>have the same career goals I had when I<br>was 13 years old and you all wanted to<br>be a volcanologist that's when I<br>realized it was actually a thing I could<br>be I still want to do the same thing but<br>I end up in Australia because my<br>grandfather was dying I met my PhD<br>advisor at a conference over a beer as<br>Adrian said I ended up being in the<br>media because I was trying to help<br>during this crisis I ended up at the<br>Smithsonian because I had visa<br>restrictions I had to be doing something<br>instead of being jobless I went and<br>volunteered and I ended up staying on<br>so whenever you see someone stand up and<br>give a talk like this you think wow<br>they've really done it if you see a name<br>like the Smithsonian up here none of the<br>details have been planned and most of<br>them have been very last minute sharp<br>turns away from where I thought I was<br>going<br>so with that<br>I want to clarify who I am and who I am<br>not and what I can do today and what I<br>can not do some volcanologists I'm a<br>trained volcanologist I am currently<br>working as a volcanologist I am not a<br>Communications specialist that is<br>something very different those are<br>people who are actually dedicated to<br>figuring out working with social science<br>research<br>how we actually work with different<br>stakeholders they work with different<br>stakeholders to best help communities<br>that is incredibly important work very<br>highly respected it is not what I am so<br>what I can do is give you my experience<br>I've been doing this for a few years now<br>and this is what I have seen if you had<br>any Communicator up here we'd probably<br>give slightly different stories and<br>that's going to depend on where you're<br>from how you're brought up your skin<br>color your sexual gender all of these<br>different things are going to play into<br>it because we're human<br>so with that if anything I say today<br>doesn't feel right to you that's okay<br>just leave it this is just what I have<br>experienced<br>so some questions I'd like for you to<br>think if you could what do you think is<br>important in communicating we've all had<br>a very real life experience the last 18<br>19 20 months with the pandemic we've all<br>seen different communicators some of<br>them brilliant some of them not so<br>brilliant I was in the states for the<br>first six months of the pandemic so I've<br>seen a bit of both<br>what stands out to you<br>what actually inspires you to listen and<br>then take actions<br>what kind of Communicator what kind of<br>words what kind of emotions what makes<br>you listen<br>what inspires you and why so<br>specifically who do you think is really<br>good and who do you think for you<br>personally just doesn't make it through<br>and no matter if you're a scientist if<br>you're a researcher if you are a teacher<br>if you are a student how can you help<br>every single one of us probably has a<br>phone laptop or both we all have access<br>to the entire planet now all of us can<br>make a very big difference<br>and the answers to these can be<br>different for every single person out<br>there<br>and that's why we need diversity and<br>those of us who are communicating<br>so I'm going to be straight up with the<br>take-home points I think we all know by<br>now that social media is incredibly<br>powerful tool for good and for bad for<br>good and for evil in some cases<br>all of us especially those of us who are<br>doing research and Sciences or any kind<br>of things that impact life on this<br>planet we can help with the information<br>that we know we don't have to have 10<br>years of experience a PhD in all of<br>these accolades in order to really make<br>a difference in people's lives we do<br>need to work together those of us within<br>the discipline so volcanology for me but<br>also Fields across the whole entire<br>Spectrum I've been very lucky to be<br>helped by a lot of meteorologists in the<br>state because they're in front of crises<br>all the time they have hurricane season<br>they have tornado season social<br>scientists are critical emergency<br>managers are critical we can all work<br>together and learn from each other<br>the media is often a mixed bag we can<br>either trust them love them hate them or<br>completely distrust everything they say<br>it is up to us to actually make those<br>relationships so we can go forward<br>helping them do their job so they can<br>help us reach people without science<br>and with great power comes great<br>responsibility<br>so how do we learn about volcanoes some<br>of us make pepper maches some of us<br>watch movies documentaries some of us<br>read tabloids some of us come to classes<br>like here at University of waikato<br>here's one example of something that<br>might form an image in someone's mind<br>about what a volcano is what a volcano<br>does and how people respond to it<br>so that was maybe volcano in 1997.<br>for everyone out there who's seen the<br>Twitter debates photography speak is way<br>better and most people agree<br>so this was in LA<br>how many of you know that there are no<br>volcanoes in L.A<br>none not not the right kind of tectonic<br>setting at all one thing this movie did<br>do very right was that is an emergency<br>management management room there so they<br>actually had the emergency managers on<br>the ground which is critical<br>but the volcano stuff is<br>pretty but you know<br>so I want a little bit of participation<br>how many volcanoes do you think are<br>erupting today and by volcano erupting I<br>mean a volcano that is an eruption phase<br>throw out some guesses please<br>four four<br>three thousand two thousand<br>I like that positivity<br>48. this is the number as of the 15th of<br>October so 48 volcanoes being an<br>eruption phase around the world today so<br>there are approximately 20 of these that<br>will actively be putting out some kind<br>of eruption product on any given day so<br>there are those two numbers that I can<br>come around usually between 40 and 50<br>that can be lower or one usually around<br>20 that's actually giving an eruption<br>product on a single day and there are<br>over 1300 that could potentially erupt<br>around the world too and with that we<br>think volcanoes that have erupted in the<br>last 12 000 years it's a relatively<br>young system that worth works on a<br>clearly very different scale than we do<br>so going over to Bali I'll go on the<br>volcano in 2017 this is their beautiful<br>volcano that popped up in the news and<br>you can see here it's up in the north<br>east corner of Bali and further south is<br>a lot of the tourism areas right next to<br>it is a Caldera volcano but tour which I<br>think most of us thought would be the<br>one erupting next since that is also<br>haven't had a lot of recent activity<br>so this is an island with a population<br>that is very reliant on tourism and that<br>is a key this is not a remote volcano<br>there are people living on the flanks of<br>the volcano Villages living on the place<br>of the volcano and people in there who<br>need tourism for their livelihoods<br>so in October 2017 sorry September 2017<br>this shows the number of earthquakes per<br>day and they are broken down a little<br>bit into the different types that's in<br>Indonesian but the point is the number<br>of earthquakes per day through time so<br>you can see here the background is<br>pretty much zero to one earthquakes per<br>day you can see here within four or five<br>days the skyrocketed over to 800 and<br>they eventually to over a thousand<br>earthquakes per day this was a very bad<br>sign so there were Mass evacuations<br>there are thousands of people evacuated<br>from the volcano and this hit the news<br>in a very big way because of the tourism<br>industry<br>so it looked like this volcano has been<br>erupt pretty quickly<br>volcanoes are all different they all had<br>their own personalities like us they<br>also have their own smooth swings and<br>some of them are a bit of a pain so this<br>one did not erupt straight away<br>but the media did<br>so I was in Pittsburgh I just finished<br>my PhD I was dedicated to finding a job<br>where I'd be kicked out of the country<br>if I didn't come up with one very soon<br>but I had a friend from umutu in fact<br>who was in Bali and he sent me a message<br>asking me what the heck was going on the<br>media was going to say the entire<br>country was going to be destroyed<br>basically<br>and this is what was being said and so I<br>started looking at the official reports<br>from cvghm and magma Indonesia the<br>official agencies and what I saw in the<br>media and they were as a huge disconnect<br>between that and of course the media was<br>what the people were paying attention to<br>so there are not only the locals who<br>were looking at the media there were the<br>expats who live in Bali so people<br>foreign Nationals living in Bali who are<br>looking at International media and there<br>were the tourists that were going to be<br>going there canceling their flight so<br>now this is an international situation<br>where everyone in the world is<br>interested it's this volcano that's<br>apparently going to destroy the island<br>you're a mass evacuations it's a big<br>problem so all I did was I started<br>posting the official information in<br>English<br>on Twitter<br>seeing pretty inconsequential at the<br>time<br>another reason why this was a big deal<br>was this volcano as a history of rather<br>explosive and dangerous eruptions<br>and the 1960s It produced lava flows in<br>the Empire because it flows in the house<br>and I'll go into what those are in a<br>minute produced around 1100 fatalities<br>and Ash Plum up to 15 kilometers that's<br>fairly significant and to date it had<br>not a lot of instrumentation<br>which is dangerous we can forecast<br>eruptions and we have a lot of<br>instrumentation we know the volcano<br>really well that gives us more data the<br>ones that we don't have data on or not<br>much data on are a little harder can<br>still be done but a little harder<br>so this happened in a time where the<br>locals remember a lot of people lost<br>family members so this was a very<br>important memory for those who lived<br>around the volcano<br>so these are the things that we should<br>be worried about at this specific<br>volcano who can tell me what volcano<br>this is and when<br>come on kiwis<br>thank you 95 96 yes<br>so this is a little different this is<br>going through a crater lake so we have a<br>very wet Ash Bloom here but this is<br>volcanic ash<br>the image here is from a favorite movie<br>Dante's Peak where they used wet<br>newspaper as volcanic ash so this is one<br>of the places where people get this idea<br>that volcanic ash is Fluffy it's not<br>that bad you can drive through it no<br>it's because they used with newspaper<br>looking under a scanning electron<br>microscope or ECM they're pretty Jagged<br>not always Jagged but pretty Jagged<br>shards of glass crystals and Rock<br>so not great not going to shred your<br>lungs like there are some ideas out<br>there but very bad if you're inhaling a<br>lot of it they can collapse roofs<br>depending on the structure<br>and they can also cause a lot of<br>problems for asthmatic pre-existing<br>conditions<br>we have ballistic predictiles which are<br>basically chunks of rock and lava thrown<br>out of the volcano at very very high<br>speeds that the impact flanks this is<br>Papa cut the people in Mexico so it's a<br>little little slow this is a night's<br>home footage image Sorry video<br>um next to it we have just actually a<br>pretty small bomb from Japan you can see<br>the kind of crater these things can<br>leave these can reach several kilometers<br>away you can see here how far down the<br>flanks these ballistic bombs are<br>actually Landing these are very very<br>dangerous even if they're small very<br>high speeds very hot they can also light<br>fires but the main issue is if you have<br>anyone on the flank of that volcano this<br>is a huge concern there's the sound wave<br>coming a few minutes later<br>foreign<br>so this is my specialty these are very<br>very hot very fast if you look very<br>closely down the bottom there's actually<br>dead trees for scale moving clouds of<br>hot volcanic ash<br>Rock trees anything that they pick up in<br>their path you do not outrun these if<br>they're a large<br>you might get lucky but very dangerous<br>if these happen you need to not be there<br>in the first place<br>so here's an example of some impacts of<br>pyroclastic flows we have monsterat<br>and next door we have Mount St Helens<br>um done here we have the deposits of<br>Mount Saint Helens eruption so they can<br>get extremely thick you can see there's<br>a person need for scale and they<br>completely destroy structures so looking<br>at that Forest 600 kilometers squared<br>was destroyed these were not tiny trees<br>these were very large trees<br>so you can see the raw power that these<br>things have they're incredibly dangerous<br>and an absolute nightmare so to get<br>people out of fear and time is critical<br>and we have lahas so I just have a<br>screenshot of the video for scale so<br>there's a geologist there<br>there's a lot of kind of range up to the<br>consistency of the concrete<br>they can then train a huge amount of<br>can occur without warning especially if<br>your business do not need an eruption to<br>be confused<br>very fast incredible very far from the<br>volcano<br>so with all of these actual issues<br>album<br>this is what the tabloids were saying<br>complete death and destruction Island<br>going to be destroyed flight should be<br>canceled volcano is spewing smoke which<br>everyone who knows me as well my trigger<br>sentence so it was a really big Miss<br>so Google set up an SOS alert for argum<br>saying this is where you go for<br>information but directly below it we see<br>the daily expressed tabloid<br>completely evolving it up so giving up<br>false information making things up<br>complete click bait and this is what<br>people were seeing when they were<br>looking up this volcano and we know now<br>research shows that false information<br>travels way faster than the information<br>so watching this video for a second<br>what<br>what should they be running from and now<br>running from<br>these people were standing on a bridge<br>video filming with a camera<br>a pyroclusive flow coming directly at<br>them this is for Wego a couple years ago<br>so that is a very high speed cloud of<br>hot gas Ash Rock these people were very<br>lucky they actually could run from it a<br>now if you can imagine these people<br>needed a few more seconds to get away<br>but they have the right information from<br>the very beginning<br>other people might have survived too I<br>mean this was a very complicated<br>situation specifically but if people<br>have the right information they can help<br>themselves when they do not have time or<br>access to official information<br>at the same time was the Kilauea<br>eruption so this was one of the lava<br>flows that was produced so both of these<br>were happening at the same time so I was<br>Fielding a lot of questions from people<br>who did not understand the difference<br>between lava flow which mostly you can<br>out-walk<br>of course once Fisher 8 got going that<br>was a bit of a different story and a<br>pyroclastic flow which is inherently<br>dangerous and destroys everything in its<br>path in a very different way so this is<br>one of those times when I realized that<br>while people know a lot about volcanoes<br>we see them a lot in movies we see them<br>on the news we know they are the basic<br>understanding of the hazards which is<br>the most critical part for anyone near a<br>so the information gets lost in many<br>different ways but going straight to it<br>back to the beginning there were<br>official reports being released in<br>Indonesian as they should be it's in<br>Indonesia they were very very busy this<br>volcanic team the volcanology team over<br>there so this was through Google<br>translate medium cauldron smoked with<br>200 meters high the magma movement in<br>the magma kitchen or just rocks to<br>continue<br>so you can kind of see how even at the<br>very beginning things can get<br>misunderstood and if you don't<br>understand<br>what that might possibly mean that can<br>get carried into International media<br>very quickly<br>so arguing as we can see here there are<br>a lot of ups and downs remember the<br>vertical scale is looking at earthquakes<br>per day it nearly got up to 1200 per day<br>so this was a long time before The Vape<br>volcano actually erupted<br>two months two months of people being in<br>evacuation centers two months of the<br>media calling crying wolf two months of<br>misinformation two months of people<br>getting sick and tired of not being able<br>to travel of not knowing who to believe<br>anymore<br>two months of frustration for the locals<br>more than anyone else<br>so when you have these prolonged events<br>as we know right now on a pandemic<br>as we go through it gets harder and<br>harder to try and give people the<br>finally wants to interrupt we can go<br>back to thinking of that volcano scene<br>for a minute I was still getting a lot<br>of questions about when was the volcano<br>going to erupt<br>and headline's saying that an eruption<br>was imminent<br>so because people didn't see Fireballs<br>or lava flows<br>there was a lot of confusion about what<br>an erupting volcano even was at this<br>point and if you're curious this is<br>extremely cool this is a very gas-rich<br>plume coming from a different vent<br>within the crater and a very Ash Rich<br>plume at the same time so this does<br>happen in a couple of other volcanoes<br>but it's a beautiful eruption thankfully<br>this eruption right now did not hurt<br>people<br>so here's a small tiny tiny tiny amount<br>of headlines around the world they were<br>dozens if not hundreds I didn't bother<br>counting them<br>so this was months of media attention<br>and almost all the information out there<br>was inaccurate and this information<br>stays there<br>we can't keep up as the experts we need<br>to work together with people who have<br>bigger platforms work with the media so<br>that we can help get good information<br>out there and this doesn't just count<br>with volcanoes we see this with<br>epidemiology we see this with climate<br>change we see this with water and air<br>quality soil quality all of these things<br>are important to different aspects of<br>our life it doesn't have to be as<br>dramatic as a volcano<br>so if we aren't filling all of these<br>gaps with actual knowledge someone else<br>will so all of these are courtesy of the<br>Tabloid in the UK The Daily Express<br>so Yellowstone Volcano warning<br>Yellowstone will erupt including some<br>human civilization<br>not won't Alaska earthquake fears grow<br>for a month to make Helen's volcano<br>eruption does anyone know how far Alaska<br>eruption warning Europe's super not a<br>super volcano and I don't know what they<br>mean by boiling but whatever they do<br>mean it wasn't doing it<br>Iceland volcano imminent this is at<br>least three years ago did you want to<br>see Cutler erupt three years ago<br>no no the Jedi<br>Indonesia suddenly hit by two huge<br>earthquakes leaving the ring of fire on<br>alerts<br>wow anyone know how many earthquakes<br>Indonesia gets all the time<br>and can we just kill right now that the<br>ring of fire is a beautiful zone of<br>earthquakes and volcanoes but it's not<br>actually a connected thing<br>and this is my favorite Yellowstone<br>volcano eruption warning hundreds of<br>Bison did as fears of Mega Blast grow<br>and then you read underneath it fears of<br>Yellowstone volcano erupting or on the<br>rise after authorities have killed more<br>than a thousand bison<br>so it's not the volcano that killed the<br>Bison<br>this is the kind of stuff that is<br>getting put out there all the time all<br>the time and we might think yeah sure<br>this is in the UK and the UK residents<br>might know<br>is there not in here from the UK<br>sorry<br>they might not pay attention to this but<br>people in the countries who might be<br>impacted by this might not know this and<br>this is all over social media<br>Yellowstone is another big one<br>we are very lucky we have all survived<br>about two dozen catastrophic life-ending<br>eruptions according to the devoids in<br>the UK<br>so this happens every time there's an<br>increase in earthquakes which naturally<br>happens by either the geothermal system<br>or the tectonics of the area or the<br>volcanic system itself there might be a<br>new paper released there might be I<br>don't know a movie come out the wind<br>might change I don't know there this<br>kind of stuff comes up all the time<br>especially with super volcanoes<br>and it's honestly filling me into nail<br>garbage<br>so if people are looking at this<br>information we need to go to where<br>they're looking in order to reach them<br>so there are many many scientists out<br>there doing many different things a<br>couple things I'm doing is I have a Blog<br>which I'm currently locked out of a<br>podcast a YouTube channel I work for the<br>Smithsonian Global balkanism program<br>who's rugby ivinsky who's constantly<br>putting out good information with the<br>team there working with media and of<br>course on social media if anyone wants<br>to go out there and do Tech talk<br>do yours but we need many of us out<br>there there is so much room for all of<br>us I don't ever want to see scientists<br>saying oh no she or he has done that we<br>need different voices we need different<br>faces we need different languages we<br>need different personalities out there<br>so there's a lot of news<br>frequently about oh well volcano<br>scientists can now predict volcanoes<br>because of XYZ we don't predict<br>volcanoes the prediction would be saying<br>that ahoi is going to erupt at 4pm on<br>Tuesday and it's going to be in vui2<br>what we do is we understand every<br>specific volcano what that volcano might<br>do understand how to monitor it we<br>forecast eruptions so a likely the<br>likelihood is that this event is going<br>to happen close to event we get more<br>information as the volcano is giving us<br>more signals this takes a team of<br>scientists who specialize in very<br>different areas SO geochemistry gas<br>seismology deformation it takes a huge<br>team or sometimes apparently just a<br>YouTube channel<br>and then we have to engage<br>there is no point in doing all of this<br>if we sit in a lab and quietly go<br>between ourselves going someone should<br>do something it's up to us to get out<br>there and do something with a<br>specifically all of the official<br>information comes from the volcano<br>Observatory and civil defense whatever<br>that is in each different country but<br>all of us can be helping people<br>understand our areas of research<br>so it does go wrong when we can't warn<br>people there are volcanic eruptions that<br>have little to no warning<br>and there are volcanic eruptions that do<br>surprise us so this is the ton of Amir<br>and the Nevada dot Ruiz in a 1985. 23<br>000 people died from Aloha very small<br>relatively small eruption<br>and so Much Death and All they had to do<br>was Evacuate the town this was very<br>early days a lot of work has been done<br>by by since then but this is a huge<br>motivator of why we have to get out<br>there work with communities get on<br>social media get where people are<br>actually paying attention to and put out<br>good information and earn that trust<br>internet<br>we shouldn't demand it we don't<br>automatically deserve people's trust<br>because we have a title we have to keep<br>earning it so that we can help people<br>this is our responsibility<br>so we have two there are many different<br>outcomes but these are two of them death<br>from zubious and Pompeii very famous<br>foreclosure both of these are impacting<br>lives clearly one of them is more severe<br>but if we have people losing their<br>livelihoods as we can see with covert<br>that's also a very bad outcome and<br>people are truly suffering through it<br>so I want people to put their hands up<br>we have<br>time along the bottom and intensity of<br>monitoring parameters going up the top<br>so that would be seismicity deformation<br>increased gases so an increase of<br>signals that a volcano is going to erupt<br>so what we see here with this orange<br>line is it's going like this put your<br>hand up please if you would call an<br>evacuation<br>oh<br>flooded faces going oh I don't know<br>because it's hard<br>these are three real examples one it<br>does go to an eruption another one like<br>agum we have that elevated activity for<br>a long time and the other is that it<br>goes back to sleep<br>so who would call an evacuation at this<br>point<br>again we have different possibilities an<br>eruption or not this is why it's so<br>incredibly critical to support the<br>actual experts who are working on the<br>volcano or the relevant people in our<br>Fields if you're not a volcanologist of<br>course and get that good information out<br>and if you are the people who are trying<br>to call that you're going to need<br>support we all need to support them<br>because if those are the people who are<br>making decisions as we can see no matter<br>what you do at a certain point people<br>are going to hate for it so we have to<br>support each other and you do not I'm<br>not just talking to scientists there we<br>all have to it takes so much of us to<br>actually have this to work<br>so if you're an expert we need to listen<br>Above All Else again this is all my<br>experience you might disagree with me<br>but we need to listen what do people<br>need to know what are people worried<br>about what do people not understanding<br>we have to keep learning and keep trying<br>to do better<br>I have experience and I still cringe<br>when people call me an expert because<br>there's so much we still don't know<br>and having spoken from just having<br>severe burnout and not being able to<br>work for months trying to recover from<br>it you have to take care of yourself and<br>each other because if you can't do<br>so huge responsibility once you make a<br>Twitter account and put volcanologists<br>soil scientists climate scientists<br>epidemiologists a seismologist<br>in your bio there are all of these<br>different audiences that then might<br>start tuning to you when there's<br>something in the News That's confusing<br>or scary<br>and we're all only an expert in one<br>thing<br>so I'm an expert in volcanoes but just<br>in this room alone there are experts in<br>other things where I'm not so while all<br>of us might be an expert in something I<br>mean people talk about the public we are<br>all the public too so we are in this<br>we're looking at visitors and tourists<br>at media and local communities and<br>people being evacuated people who are<br>just interested and of course other<br>scientists too so there's a lot that<br>goes into this so once you have an<br>audience<br>there's a lot of things that we can do<br>we can of course supporting the word<br>from the official Observatory or the<br>experts in the local area depending on<br>your field we can ask the general<br>question so what is a chiropractic flow<br>we can monitor media activity and go<br>okay this is being said but this is<br>actually what this means doing<br>interviews and working with people<br>behind the scenes where you're doing the<br>interviews to make sure that you're<br>getting the information right through<br>argon I had a pretty big team of people<br>helping me not none of this work has<br>been Me by myself<br>that would be dangerous and<br>irresponsible<br>sharing preparedness and information<br>with official links giving sharing the<br>updates from the official agencies<br>addressing rumors<br>and explaining the relevant processes<br>so<br>every volcano question basically starts<br>with it depends<br>so this is a really simple question what<br>will the volcano do in order to answer<br>this as a communicator the amount of<br>background knowledge you have to have is<br>enormous and this goes for almost any<br>question about volcanoes<br>I had the credit there as HBO but I took<br>it off because that would be a bit of a<br>spoiler<br>this is Kilauea and this isn't showing<br>the park plastic flows that happened<br>much further ago so you can see we have<br>everything ranging from lava flows<br>different types of lava flows we have a<br>lava lake we have a lot of Fountain we<br>have strombolian activity we have fishes<br>opening up and we have cold era collapse<br>which as we know now isn't all the end<br>of the world of more cold there are<br>collectors sometimes it's very slowly<br>too plus a giant Ash balloon<br>so luckily the Hawaii Volcan Observatory<br>is very good at what they do they're the<br>huge dedicated team who watch this<br>volcano<br>and they put up the information and as a<br>volcanologist it's up to us to help<br>people get that information and then<br>understand it<br>so we can work through crisis time and<br>peace time so when it is peace time we<br>can be explaining what these things are<br>we can be earning this trust we can be<br>building communities and crisis timing<br>can be dedicated to a specific situation<br>helping people understand what is going<br>on<br>the things that I see that we need to do<br>better we're getting better at directing<br>people to the officials like I say that<br>over and over again like a broken record<br>but no one knows the specific volcano<br>like they do including links yes you<br>might get a lot of likes and retweets if<br>you post a pretty picture but that's<br>really not helping anyone<br>we need to be more compassionate and<br>considerate<br>this is really important if there's an<br>amazing volcano picture and you're<br>getting all excited about it and someone<br>who's just had their house destroyed<br>sees it that has not been considered<br>amplifying the official messaging<br>everything you say as an expert is a<br>mini press release and can be used in<br>the media without your permission<br>knowing your audience and what your<br>goals actually are is what you'll get<br>told at any base of training for science<br>communication and again working as a<br>team<br>so I speak to a lot of scientists people<br>who have contacted me saying that they<br>have been asked to do an interview and<br>there's always a hesitation first of all<br>is imposter syndrome which most if not<br>all of us have thinking we're not good<br>enough we're not next but enough there<br>is of course just the public speaking<br>fear but the number one fear of<br>scientists is other scientists<br>getting bullied by other scientists for<br>what you've said or what they think<br>you're saying my mother is nodding she<br>knows what I mean<br>but most journalists are doing a really<br>good job so we can really lay that one<br>to rest yes sometimes we do get<br>misquoted and sometimes we get taken way<br>out of context and over 200 media<br>interviews this has happened to me about<br>three times<br>so this one here the Daily Express is<br>saying Yellowstone volcano eruption<br>would be devastating for the globe<br>volcanologist and increment award as she<br>laid me at whatever I refuse to speak to<br>this tabloid they're making it sound<br>like I spoke to them and they removed<br>the context of me talking about a very<br>large eruption<br>and ignore taking out the context of<br>most eruptions or lava flows or<br>hydrothermal<br>so it does happen but we have to be kind<br>enough friendly enough and helpful<br>enough to Media so that we can get more<br>good information out there<br>some of the things we can do is working<br>with<br>um working with science writers and<br>journalists so we can get<br>pre-released this is coming up we might<br>want to know get out good information<br>about this so if there's a paper coming<br>up for example especially in a high-risk<br>volcano like Yellowstone<br>and me preparing things on social media<br>so this was done when there was an<br>embargo on on a paper that came out in<br>Catholic regret for your a so that's<br>Italy's Yellowstone<br>and there was two days for the media to<br>work on it for them to get their<br>interviews from volcanologists and then<br>everything went out together and there<br>wasn't really a chance for the tabloids<br>and those not with not so well meaning<br>the messages I get from people during<br>these events are absolutely<br>heartbreaking and go-reaching so you can<br>see here a mum of five who can't sleep<br>someone who was having severe mental<br>health problems from anxiety someone who<br>does dialysis you were not wondering if<br>he needed to evacuate these were all<br>because of mega tsunami rumors from La<br>Palmer and the Canary Islands and all of<br>these people are across the ocean in the<br>United States<br>causing real harm to people<br>who are truly terrified and a world<br>where we already have a pandemic to live<br>with<br>so if you're not an expert what can you<br>do always find the experts as the<br>obviously first one be careful what you<br>read be very critical of what you read<br>and be more critical and careful about<br>what you share so in New Zealand finding<br>those experts genius in support offense<br>are the experts and then there are<br>University groups like devorah up in<br>Auckland who have other groups at<br>universities who who are experts in<br>different areas those are our experts<br>so then once you get to this kind of<br>stuff Tenerife tsunami warning issued at<br>the catastrophic volcanic eruption a<br>month ago obviously this was not a thing<br>this did not happen and then USGS is<br>giving out information actually<br>explaining why this is not a risk the<br>way people are saying it is so once<br>you've done this background work you can<br>start to see where to get information<br>and where not to<br>so I'm going to finish up with a story<br>about Tilly Smith and 2004 she was 10<br>years old in Thailand<br>for Christmas with his family two weeks<br>prior to that her teacher had given a<br>lesson on tsunamis<br>Tilly was at the beach and realized that<br>the ocean was acting a bit strange it<br>wasn't really going in and out like it<br>should and there was bubbling at the<br>surface because of a lesson from her<br>teacher in the UK two weeks ago she knew<br>what it was and because she was 10 years<br>old she wasn't embarrassed enough to<br>start telling people a tsunami was<br>coming<br>she kicked up on a bus her family<br>listened to her they informed the people<br>working at the beach that was one of the<br>few beaches where everyone wasn't killed<br>by the tsunami or at least there were no<br>fatalities this ten-year-old with a<br>little bit of knowledge<br>saved a beach load of people because she<br>had the simple knowledge she wasn't an<br>expert she didn't have a PhD and she<br>wasn't embarrassed enough to stand up<br>and say something<br>so every single one of us has that power<br>no matter who you are no matter what you<br>do if you're a scientist if you're<br>someone who's enthusiastic about<br>volcanoes if you're someone who just<br>wants to know more<br>through being really responsible with<br>information every single one of you<br>might be that person who gives someone<br>the right information they need to save<br>their life to make their life better<br>and to make life the heckable at least a<br>lot less stressful for them<br>so I believe in all of you who go out<br>and make a difference no matter what you<br>do because I did not see it coming in my<br>um so when I open the forward to<br>questions and Andrew just keep an eye on<br>so I think we've got enough in the room<br>will be first off the rank Louis yeah um<br>thanks for tuning awesome for really<br>really interesting<br>um<br>so it sounded like that for you it<br>started like with a single Twitter or<br>something like that but then you started<br>talking about having a team of people<br>that you can rewind how did you build<br>that team how did that come back so the<br>question for anyone online was<br>um this I've got a situation coming very<br>rapidly but then I spoke about building<br>a team how did I do that<br>um I basically message friends I think I<br>put out a message on Facebook asking who<br>could help<br>um and I had people within across<br>different time zones volcanologists<br>mostly<br>um some people who are much more senior<br>than I was people who someone in<br>Indonesia so could be had also other<br>people outside of this Core Group who<br>could help me with translations people<br>in Bali who I was also giving<br>information to and they're also also<br>helping me understand things so I had a<br>core group just in Facebook Messenger<br>who were awake during different time<br>zones this was 12 hours time zone<br>difference from me so I was doing this<br>through the night for two to three<br>months<br>so yeah it was very basic it was not a<br>public information officer situation I<br>pulled together people I knew on some of<br>them I didn't know yet and people just<br>we just all wanted to help<br>and then more people got in touch later<br>who had more expertise in communication<br>and of course I was in touch with the<br>so I have a question yeah so<br>um I don't know if you really have<br>advantages but those three antidocious<br>show<br>you know all those people who were being<br>afraid of a volcano thousands of miles<br>away it wasn't going to blow up<br>did you were you able to help them<br>because what I had found<br>um as a contextualized this kind of had<br>contextualized this by saying that I I<br>worked with the civil defense and the<br>regular region as a planner<br>um and I can tell you that the<br>information cycle that we worked with is<br>essentially 24 hours and you know it's<br>every time you put on an update it's<br>basically on a daily basis and<br>there's no way we can provide need<br>up-to-date information like people can<br>read false information on social media<br>and so what happens often is that when<br>people are freaking out and they see<br>that the official channel is releasing<br>information at most points today because<br>that's the process<br>um they go to the most recent<br>information they have and so essentially<br>every day is a reset because every day<br>you're resetting their their<br>um false perception of the situation so<br>what do you think of that yes oh my<br>goodness I see that all the time so the<br>question is talking about how as an<br>emergency manager<br>information basically gets reset every<br>day because the officials can't keep up<br>none of us can there are a couple<br>thousand volcanologists and then there<br>are tabloids and people YouTube videos<br>putting out information every single day<br>and a lot of it not true we can't keep<br>up<br>we just can't so with the people I<br>showed<br>the three people the three examples out<br>of many two of them I did help and one<br>of them I didn't<br>two of them I could explain what was<br>going on I sent them the USGS link about<br>the Tsunami because I'm not a tsunami<br>expert and explain that there is a lot<br>of misinformation<br>and one of them there was nothing I<br>could do to keep up with the anxiety<br>that was being caused by YouTube<br>so you can't always help it is a hard<br>job<br>taking into consideration a need for<br>good work like work-life balance do I<br>love my job yes I love my job so much<br>I got into volcanology because I love<br>volcanoes and I love people all of the<br>communication stuff I do though is not<br>my job<br>I do this purely because I care but I am<br>absolutely madly in love with volcanoes<br>and I still can't believe I get to call<br>myself a bocknologist<br>thanks<br>do you think it's a specific type of<br>uh specialization in science<br>communication where<br>to focus on natural hazards<br>um rather than kind of addressing kind<br>of other science so how I guess my<br>question is how specific should you get<br>as a science Communicator<br>um<br>and<br>yeah so the question is how specific<br>should you get as a communicator<br>um we need all different types<br>so whatever is firing you up whatever<br>you feel comfortable doing whatever you<br>wherever basically where do you see you<br>get where is there a Gap that you can<br>help fill so for some of us that is<br>talking broadly about volcanoes and how<br>they affect people<br>for some of us that's talking about a<br>specific process so someone's<br>specializing in paragraphic flows or<br>remote sensing or a specific tool<br>and others it's really about the people<br>as well so we need all of it because<br>there is never ever one person who's<br>going to reach everyone you're going to<br>be people who are out there who hate you<br>because of what your nose looks like<br>that's the age of social media and being<br>on camera so we need everyone talking<br>about what is passionate for you what<br>you're passionate about and hopefully we<br>can reach more people that way there is<br>really no one way to communicate some<br>people really like the communicators who<br>are angry and fired up and drop any of<br>dropping if Bombs all over the place<br>some people like sarcastic humor some<br>people like those who are more gentle it<br>really depends on who you're trying to<br>reach you cannot possibly reach everyone<br>foreign<br>so from your experience<br>just is there something that we can<br>change kind of in a government policy<br>label that allows us to be able to<br>communicate more effectively and deal to<br>the tablets<br>it's probably not a fair question but<br>it's a good question so the question is<br>is there something we can do at a<br>government policy level when it comes to<br>misinformation through media honestly I<br>don't know<br>um it's something I definitely thought<br>about I don't know enough about coal I<br>don't know anything about policy when it<br>comes to it really but that's a good<br>question and that's when we need to work<br>with people who do know because like the<br>tabloids in the UK that tabloid is<br>actually one that um<br>the Prince Harry and Kate who have been<br>they've been trying to go after them and<br>it didn't work I think so there are<br>higher people trying to combat this and<br>it's still not working can our<br>governments do more here probably but<br>then we get into things like censorship<br>and all of that really complicated stuff<br>about how do we tell what's good<br>information what's not I actually got in<br>touch with Google when it came to that<br>SOS thing and the answer was yes wow<br>this is a problem we didn't know because<br>we're not volcanologists<br>they're not this is one problem<br>we have so many different catastrophic<br>issues around the planet that there's<br>misinformation on so where does a<br>company like Google or the New Zealand<br>government<br>again<br>especially if you need to have an expert<br>in the room to actually tell you what's<br>good information and what's not<br>so<br>with social media being so new<br>there are so many questions we don't<br>have answers to yet<br>how about Mill made you feel a little<br>positive at least a little bit of death<br>instruction in there there's a lot of<br>good we can do guys and Volcan is a very<br>nice and I mean they're not being<br>distracted experience<br>like well Jay I think I'm very pleased<br>we had you today because I think we're<br>all weren't we've kind of put out our<br>jobs in perspective so<br>um I'm hoping to have an asked Margaret<br>yet I'm hoping to get her to hang around<br>as an honorary<br>um<br>position because we are fighting a paper<br>together<br>um so maybe<br>we get that if I'm successful we can<br>see Janine around a bit a bit more I<br>hope so you'll look like very nice<br>people<br>okay so uh thank you Janine
