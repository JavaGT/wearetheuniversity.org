However, pieces of the breakwater can be displaced by the turbulent tsunami flow, which undermines the stability of the breakwater and reduces its mitigation effectiveness. As parts of New Zealand are occasionally exposed to tsunamis, assessing the damage to breakwaters in tsunami-prone coasts is, therefore, valuable for the port authority, cargo owners, and coastal residents. Physical experiments were conducted to assess potential damage to a typical composite breakwater in New Zealand due to tsunamis. Research shows higher breakwaters can resist a stronger bore impact and experience delayed initiation of the same damage.<br><br>Dr. Zhonghou Xu is a coastal modeller at NIWA Hamilton. He obtained his PhD from The University of Auckland, investigating tsunami hydrodynamics and tsunami mitigation. His research interests include hydrodynamics and sediment transport modelling, flood and inundation and hazards mitigation.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so talk about the stability of the<br>typical and New Zealand<br>um composite broken water<br>um on the impact of the potential<br>tsunami in New Zealand<br>and we'll see how a typical<br>um will perform on this um the broke<br>water will perform on the tsunamis<br>and<br>um well um<br>and introduce a parameter to the design<br>of broke water to a resist um the<br>tsunami in Tampa tech<br>um so tsunami is not really New Zealand<br>um we've experienced<br>um several in the past<br>so historical economies um<br>so we've heard about extreme tsunamis<br>like<br>um Indian Ocean Islamic in 2004 and we<br>can also<br>um grade is Japan's I mean in 2011 which<br>is a big one so in New Zealand we have a<br>seriously<br>of um<br>different sources<br>um<br>so from this figure in the bottom left<br>panel we can see<br>infamous<br>um<br>more camels a curve along the state<br>boundaries<br>it's<br>um<br>and here is production level where<br>um<br>the<br>um most significant earthquake<br>in New Zealand history<br>um occurred<br>um<br>so there are different sources of<br>tsunamis<br>um so when a disturbance to a water body<br>like um devotion<br>or or lakes<br>disturbed by<br>cheap resources it can cause a tsunami<br>or small so the most common one is the<br>earthquake<br>um you can also<br>um pressure anomaly can also call<br>tsunami which is called tsunami and<br>landslides<br>opposed um<br>on the Waterland slide or Landslide<br>overlapped pumpkin called tsunamis<br>Church like<br>Atkins devotion<br>also volcano eruption and cascading<br>effect can also cause all tsunamis<br>um the cascading effect light um on<br>water or explosion<br>um the proclastic density current and<br>also<br>the order of collapse or flag clubs and<br>can cause the distal to the water and<br>um<br>lens can be very large from several<br>ranges from several minutes to more than<br>um<br>so let's look at the video from 2011<br>foreign<br>earthquake in the ocean of the Japanese<br>Coast<br>and also with some tsunamis to New<br>Zealand<br>um in 2016<br>um the calculator earthquake<br>which is<br>um<br>also causing this small scale tsunami in<br>South Island ex Peninsula especially in<br>some Vision space like little pigeon Bay<br>so this Cottage<br>um based on the head of little pigeon<br>due to this event so<br>this tsunami was caused by the<br>earthquake<br>um<br>the on the water Landslide and also<br>contributing to<br>this<br>um<br>Islamic signal<br>and type label<br>2019 and also that tsunami proposed some<br>damage in New Zealand especially in<br>Bluetooth<br>in the Marine structure<br>was damaged<br>okay um<br>so as I say that if um as tsunami occur<br>it can cause um significant damage to<br>um Coastal structures like um false<br>damage to and sea walls record Waters<br>and handwalls bridges<br>and buildings it can Transporters and<br>several towns and buildings into several<br>kilometers away<br>um<br>so it is also important to know the<br>potential damage to a structure<br>especially the important infrastructure<br>so that we can<br>um<br>rescue the local redditors<br>so today our topic is to investigate the<br>Islamic damage to break Waters<br>so<br>in New Zealand those thread quarters are<br>sheltered by the geography but some are<br>which is<br>quite active and<br>tsunamis can occur you never know<br>and we can say the<br>physics plate is moving in that<br>direction<br>so<br>we chose that um break water as the kids<br>study so that's the<br>um Navy airport and um<br>break water so it's facing the open<br>ocean<br>so just a bit of um introduction<br>Breakwater so the brick water<br>um is a<br>protective structure defending<br>um<br>the Tranquility<br>um<br>so it's<br>um<br>it's usually designed<br>to and wind waves<br>but not extreme waves like tsunami waves<br>so it's important to know how it was a<br>so on the other side and there is um<br>um<br>so normally on the<br>um<br>some ways from the open lotion or<br>to<br>investigate the more stability of a<br>quarter on the tsunami attack<br>um<br>to construct a recorder or in a<br>controlled environment in this case<br>can exploratory<br>so for experimental study we cannot<br>simulate tsunamis in the devotion<br>because<br>it's far from obligation speed and the<br>deep ocean and<br>and also it's a more scale in the near<br>Coast we can assimilate the tsunami<br>cause and its impact the structures<br>to anticipate in introduction to this<br>facility<br>um that's called tsunami Flume or a Dam<br>breaks room so here is a Learning<br>Channel which is 19.2 meters long 1.2<br>meters wide and 1.2 meters deep<br>connected to a red alarm off which has a<br>storage capacity of the city cubic<br>meters<br>um so if the red wire is filled with<br>water and we'll live to facilitated<br>quickly in water the world would have<br>rushed to the main Channel forming the<br>um then brake flow and we use that then<br>break flow to simulate tsunami rules so<br>how can we do that I'll explain later<br>and here we have seleus gate and control<br>system so that we can control water so<br>moving on to the gate um<br>so then break flow and Islamic War<br>analogy<br>um so this will have more by chance on<br>in 2006 facilitates our use of the<br>democrac flow to simulate ceramic walls<br>and they investigated the war front<br>Solarity in three surface profile of the<br>and compare is it um Forefront celebrity<br>and Professor propellers that measured<br>from Royal islamis and um<br>actually quite aidable agreement was<br>achieved<br>and um we did say that we can use<br>temporary flow to simulate ceramic balls<br>and The Damp break flow we can measure<br>the number or<br>and um compare that remember to<br>um to remember in real tsunamis<br>um if um it agrees well we can<br>simulate this number<br>um also we need to make sure that the<br>um the state is lifted lifted quite<br>quickly<br>so first of all we'll need to<br>investigate the tsunami board properties<br>um so we can change the width of our<br>water depth and also the gauge opening<br>height<br>um so with the different combinations<br>between the decade um for reasonably<br>long long and we can generate different<br>balls and this different ball divs and<br>propagation speeds and also we found<br>this different to remember<br>um<br>to the maximum ball dips can be<br>0.2<br>meters<br>in the label so if we use a scale factor<br>of 40 or we can get a<br>um in reality and the free number and<br>create that stage stage um just from 1<br>to 1.6 which compared well with<br>um so the<br>ball depths will measure that using Wave<br>catches and<br>the speed and the<br>um<br>the ball was measured using let's start<br>looking EDD<br>um<br>um put the ball from<br>there's an aeration and uh because it's<br>been exposed to here<br>initially<br>um so before that uh<br>ball team propagation speed we use some<br>other businesses which is distance<br>divided by the time of heaven so the<br>distance<br>um so let's look at the more properties<br>we have people from<br>and they create that 30 stage following<br>is quite constant and as well as the<br>referral number of<br>um<br>so after<br>um we get their properties uh we can<br>construct a Breakwater<br>a scaled Breakwater in the foods<br>um let's look at um the layout of the<br>um<br>reporter so here is the cross section<br>this is the cross-section we use<br>um in the study you can see from this<br>instant picture that in 1947 an<br>earthquake occurred in here or quite<br>close to Navy at all it actually that<br>to about the cross-section<br>um<br>so the outer layer is the armor layer<br>the<br>13.6<br>tomb units under that is on the layer<br>um eight on Limestone Rock and behind<br>that is on free blocks you can precast<br>concrete blocks<br>um<br>so if the image<br>to have destruction so I'll go to<br>details of this um<br>before that we did some survey on the<br>rocks and the<br>more units<br>so<br>because if we<br>um our purpose is to investigate the<br>stability of the broke water and the<br>correct water consists of this<br>um<br>units for example the ECMO units<br>limestone rocks and concrete blocks<br>so we use fruit similarity and the<br>length scale is 40<br>the weight scale is different because we<br>want to maintain the similarity of<br>the stability between the layer and in<br>reality<br>um so this is crucial to to keep that<br>stability and similarity we have the<br>stability number and is so the idea is<br>if we keep the um stability number and<br>is the same in the lab and in reality we<br>and this are the units so the ECMO units<br>we make that using a technology called<br>cavity injection molding<br>um<br>and for<br>this rocks I made them by myself which<br>is halibur's work<br>just look at that it's um it's laborers<br>and it's difficult because we want to<br>keep that density as well as the weight<br>for a single block<br>so maybe it's in in a container through<br>the lab so after construction<br>um you can do a selfie<br>um so as I said this problem is 1.2<br>meters wide and<br>um<br>I focus on the central part of the<br>structure<br>I want to avoid the war effect as much<br>as possible so I died um<br>the background is<br>um equal size and black and if the model<br>um I dye different colors and for the<br>aircon units um so that I can track<br>so the central part or the test section<br>is one um 0.8 meters wide personally<br>labeled different numbers through<br>different blocks behind that armor units<br>oh<br>um so I tested four different Breakwater<br>Heights<br>and bomb<br>um<br>five layers<br>um six blocks two two layers of lots um<br>and<br>um exposed this structures to a range of<br>so here's a video<br>um when<br>structure<br>so um<br>approached the structure<br>um impact impacted<br>the top<br>um the structure<br>um<br>and of course some damage<br>actually<br>and we can<br>um you can see that those damage is in<br>the armor layer<br>and after The Omelette is destroyed the<br>on the layer will be extracted and um<br>as ported to the inland area<br>and after that<br>there's Big Blocks<br>um<br>will be in danger and maybe transported<br>and we classify the impact phases in in<br>four stages the first one is the initial<br>impact<br>um second one is Flash up we have space<br>and all the Talking phase<br>and the quad that I study overflow<br>interface<br>and the major instruction is in this<br>special phase and also disco topping<br>face and make sure that um<br>overflow phase the damage is<br>a small compared to this other there's<br>two phases<br>so now the problem becomes how to unto<br>typically analyze the damage to the<br>correct water<br>um<br>me<br>um so first we<br>um<br>analyze the damage due to different ball<br>height and different brick water height<br>so horizontally is with increasing ball<br>height<br>and yes we can say that this increasing<br>ball height or stronger ball is damaged<br>as<br>which is as expected and horizontal um<br>vertically from top to bottom<br>um is this increasing Breakwater height<br>absolutely been recorded High increases<br>um and also we can have built it um so<br>first the damage occurs in the armor<br>layer and then<br>um the on the layer<br>and after there is the blocks behind our<br>units<br>so<br>um we'll need to quantitatively Quant um<br>analyze damage and um we<br>posed um<br>the parameter called<br>um<br>B so<br>B is<br>um<br>is here so it is<br>the<br>stabilizing strands divided by the C<br>Step 11 stress<br>um so stabilizing strands include the<br>effect of brick water height HP and<br>relative density of the units Delta and<br>the size of the Unit D and infinity<br>um and this and these level items<br>strands is inch North we which is the<br>maximum tapes of the tsunami pool<br>and we have two damaged parameters from<br>literature the damaged parameter is and<br>the Damage ratio Rd so this Rd is<br>simple<br>um is despised number of units divided<br>by the total number of units<br>and the Damage parameter is the<br>um eroded area of the broken water<br>profile divided by the size<br>D and 50 squared and we have the<br>protocol parameters to calculate<br>um the infusion area AE<br>so we have<br>um<br>um this FB and we have two damage<br>parameters we can plot<br>um the damage<br>of the armor layer<br>in these two figures so<br>um we can see that um<br>the first horizontal access is FB um<br>vertical access is<br>um is which is the damage so it<br>um links the damage and<br>um the<br>parameters of the<br>Breakwater cell and also the tsunami<br>stress<br>in this case h naught<br>so you can see when FB is<br>um 0.5 or smaller<br>total Destruction occurred and if FB is<br>larger than 1.0 the damage is very small<br>um so you can say the s is<br>three and um the displaced um<br>displays number<br>or just play the percentage of the<br>Amazon<br>it's less than 10 percent<br>so um those two figures are useful<br>because it provides a guidance for us to<br>and design a Breakwater that can resist<br>a certain type of tsunami for example if<br>we want to<br>um keep the um<br>um broke water stable under a certain<br>tsunami<br>um we can say we want to<br>have the damage<br>um less than 10<br>um or less than 10 of the armor units<br>will be um placed<br>um we can use this one and find that<br>value of FB for example if B is 1.0<br>and we can use this FB to<br>um to link the<br>Breakwater property and the tsunami<br>strands<br>um or a given<br>um<br>damage<br>um say 10<br>um the Tsunami<br>Tsunami tapes will affect<br>um that um<br>damage as well as the Breakwater height<br>the armor<br>um unit size<br>so that we<br>um if we have um the 10<br>um<br>threshold<br>and we want to keep that in threshold on<br>the right number two meters<br>um<br>tsunami depth can quickly calculate<br>um if we have a certain<br>and<br>there's some limitation to our research<br>it's a<br>little to a similar cross-section with<br>similar interlocking among primary units<br>the future will um<br>the war experiment is different<br>profiles<br>and<br>we can also use other<br>parameters to quantify the damage to<br>umalea as well as the<br>and the last I'd like to acknowledge the<br>University of Auckland for those<br>mechanical laboratory and get your<br>headers research platform and Napier<br>Port Limited and office New Zealand so<br>if you would like to<br>um<br>gives me more information you can look<br>at this application<br>so so what<br>no context whatsoever so what sort of<br>tsunami is to break water currently just<br>able to stand<br>um<br>so um do you mean maybe a pork rough<br>water<br>um so let's look at this<br>so<br>um so the each note is the tsunami depth<br>the maximum tsunami tips<br>and the Damage damages are is in RT so<br>um<br>the current scenario is actually<br>um<br>it's the current<br>um brick order scenario<br>um<br>so<br>um if you think that's acceptable damage<br>and so the corresponding system tips is<br>um<br>156<br>um millimeter in the layer so times 40<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>and my second question was about the the<br>Breakwater did you try different<br>compactions of the granular model<br>is um is the contraction also affect the<br>results<br>and<br>we try to keep the same compaction<br>in this study and actually there's some<br>availability in the results<br>and we use the average average results<br>can you go to the demonstration damage<br>threshold yeah no damage ratio the<br>formula<br>yeah so the end this place is just the<br>upper unit<br>so if the armored unit is completely<br>restored so there is no chance of it<br>stopping anything<br>if the core unit remains unit completely<br>erodes so you will take it as complete<br>failure like<br>um since it's all right I didn't get it<br>um did you mean if the comma layer is<br>decent place<br>and you are still left with the core<br>unit right<br>is um<br>or<br>attraction to the Arma layer<br>um we in this regards we do not analyze<br>the damage of the cracked water as a<br>whole<br>who can um analyze the damage to the<br>black water like um<br>the under layer and also the concrete<br>blocks<br>so I guess I've got it sorry<br>just just another question about the<br>armor units so you only uh try like with<br>the few ones what about the other shapes<br>um like there are kind of the new ones<br>can lock each other and and like uh<br>shape a very strong Army layer so easily<br>different I guess yes that's um<br>it should be different<br>um so that's the limitation of our work<br>our work is um the limitations for a<br>similar profile a similar it's looking<br>between the other layer it's so so um<br>that I'm a layer<br>um<br>um the units are well interlocked it<br>should be<br>um<br>stronger in terms of the resistance to<br>um impact<br>yeah because like new kind of New<br>Harvest using different type of armor<br>units these days so like uh it could be<br>very very different the result but<br>yes yes it's probably a bit different<br>yeah<br>in this case um the interlocking is um<br>they can be uniform interlocked<br>because in the Napier case it's uh<br>it's<br>so if you share a picture of the the<br>damage parameters again<br>so that's<br>the bottom looks pretty nice right<br>everything's kind of collapsed and more<br>or less one wine<br>something I get I guess if you knew<br>you'd probably would have done it so<br>there must be something missing that's<br>stopping those top<br>top figures from collapsing down onto<br>one line<br>that could be something like the<br>compaction or something<br>yeah that's a good question<br>um yeah that's why we use different<br>damage parameters and also<br>um actually we<br>um also use another parameters<br>um different to FB as the horizontal<br>um x's and in that results<br>um it's not<br>um even advocated at this one yeah it's<br>yes there can be there can be many more<br>variabilities related<br>um<br>but<br>yeah<br>I guess my question is thinking about<br>is that I haven't got a good feel for<br>what the pythometry is like beyond the<br>Breakwater is it<br>would it already sharp or is it really<br>deep<br>so I guess I guess your point of impact<br>is the scaling right<br>so that's kind of my question in terms<br>so um for some tsunamis the<br>um before<br>the largest away there will be a<br>recession in the water and it will<br>expose them to grab water to<br>maybe to<br>um<br>the um<br>this office<br>and and we need some assumptions that<br>um so before the impact it's um it's dry<br>um and um<br>family<br>yeah that's the Assumption and actually<br>some some other practices are<br>in<br>the modern flat area it can be exposed<br>to<br>um<br>we use dry data initial conditions<br>mainly because of the recession um the<br>not to be right mate would have started<br>to shoulder before it even got to go to<br>the break room because it was a<br>particularly just walked straight over<br>nice balance between<br>the depth at which input your break<br>and you know I have one little question<br>have you considered a conditioned off of<br>several tsunamis because it's usually in<br>reality there might have been four or<br>five or six or hundred balls<br>so that's possible that the second<br>tsunami board wishes to break water when<br>the first one has not ended yet so there<br>might be some overlap so how would you<br>consider benefits<br>well um so I guess um the um<br>the most severe damage will be caused by<br>the largest is numbing wave so for<br>example a a plane of tsunami waves<br>propagate to the coast<br>the damage will um<br>will be the most significant damage will<br>oh that's a cumulative effect the<br>president if the<br>preceding if something door will damage<br>to the Breakwater<br>um<br>that that also will also affect the<br>damage<br>so first of all<br>that<br>um it's straight and voltage itself<br>um<br>no no<br>um the first wave can be the most<br>um severe and the largest wave<br>um but<br>um<br>cases the second wave or the third and<br>I don't know<br>I think that's um because of the<br>um<br>generation mechanism of tsunamis<br>for example is an earthquake is a source<br>the<br>first wave being not the largest<br>um I'm not sure<br>can we just extrapolate this result to<br>that so we can assume the first one does<br>erode some are online then we can use<br>the second one as a single wave which I<br>so can't we just extrapolate these<br>results to it right instead of<br>considering that line so the first wave<br>comes maybe it does 60 Commandments some<br>20 conversion then you consider the<br>error one as the break order then you<br>can set the next wave then like that you<br>can just extrapolate this right and<br>that's the interactions between the<br>receding that's why then interacts the<br>propaganda<br>then just like the example from the<br>first one and then goes to second one<br>and the background from the second one<br>third one so it kind of damped the other<br>one maybe the first one is not this song<br>is the second one there I don't know but<br>after a while going to damn the the rest<br>because of the background or fellows<br>from photos from the response and also<br>they uh the heights of water are<br>changing after a while the difference<br>the high difference is going to be<br>decreased so the instructive power of<br>the uh after like four or five waves<br>they're going to be much less than the<br>do you think it's a Bible to reproduce<br>those interaction of achievables using<br>computational models like to have used<br>and that might cost a bit complicated<br>yeah in terms of the computer modeling<br>um they're very um some advanced in<br>numerical modeling as I guess SPH can do<br>this<br>um interaction between<br>um<br>between tsunami ball and the structure<br>and<br>another course is phdm<br>um<br>can also simulate that<br>which is quite<br>computationally expensive I'm not an I<br>guess building bed<br>yeah there are few groups that they did<br>it but like it not for like a complete<br>Hardware just like uh a mimics of others<br>like a single obstacle Auditors few of<br>obstacles they they use uh clinical<br>modeling for them break and also they<br>continuous type of the babes for that<br>but for a larger scale you'll give me<br>the real size is is very high<br>computational one but for a small ones<br>they already did deliver cons simulation<br>some good from Santa Barbara University<br>I guess by some other different<br>environment<br>uh just one little just the last one<br>you know to defense against us<br>so do we need to consider other factors<br>if we have that money can we just simply<br>increase the height so that'd be safe<br>right<br>um<br>um years<br>um but that's it will be expensive<br>um so actually<br>um to hide<br>um can be interpreted as the<br>um the height above water<br>um<br>um so if you have a recorder that's<br>it's much higher that will cost<br>um<br>a lot more money<br>you need to increase them as well and<br>also<br>um<br>the cost of per quarter and also the<br>risk of a tsunami and what size of the<br>so my understanding is that Bridgewater<br>is designed to essentially bring wind<br>driven waves up right and if you can<br>deal with total there's exponents that's<br>not the primary design<br>and most of the damage from tsunami is<br>not so much the height of astronomy even<br>when we focus on that but the sheer body<br>or water<br>right that then basically comes into a<br>place where there's no way no water<br>displacing air right and causing damage<br>and so if the brick water is not high<br>enough they're actually<br>start you're not even coming in right<br>then how much<br>benefit does Breakwater really provide<br>in the event of a tsunami you know I can<br>imagine that because<br>the top of the Bridgewater it's still<br>creating damage on land I mean just to<br>break water is slow the water down the<br>progression of the wave down or is it<br>just about reducing the initial impact<br>weight the height advantage of impact<br>wave because to me that that's it's only<br>a minor contributor to the damage<br>Cosmetics map<br>foreign<br>of the sheltered area<br>and it will slow the Sami<br>quite um<br>not not too much but<br>um a little bit<br>um<br>will be abused at the seaside of the<br>harbor right and that and nothing we<br>still have some symbols at the other<br>side of town to predict to defend<br>against the waves is that true<br>I understand there's actually a part of<br>the two layers of the plantation when<br>the weather is over the first layer of<br>the recorder that we have impact on the<br>another type of symbol that's my<br>understanding what you really need is a<br>to deal with tsunamis right these are<br>really very Advanced the evolution<br>simply landscape Evolution imbalanced<br>but evolution simply isn't equipped to<br>deal with<br>um because there's no way of selecting<br>an applicable structure so you're right<br>you know mangroves are effective because<br>it's basically we're getting dragged the<br>whole time<br>and actually the hard part<br>icular structures are expense expensive<br>um<br>but that's why we need soft measures<br>like regular drills<br>um to teach people where to go um to go<br>to higher land and to build some<br>robust structures to<br>I can serve as a protective structure<br>under Islamic<br>in the long<br>terms<br>they learned oh several after several<br>tsunamis they just the only way you can<br>deal with is to not build with the<br>develop its life<br>and in Tauranga um they have regular<br>materials<br>how people<br>they had about half an hour so that was<br>the real issues they just and it didn't<br>trigger some of the warnings because it<br>wasn't<br>risks<br>it's trip in a wide building expanding a<br>lot more when it's flat as a pancake<br>right even not even tsunami just a title<br>we're making across the area there you<br>have a giant swimming<br>all right<br>any more questions<br>if you're attendance and thanks for all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
