pleasure to<br>welcome you all to this special occasion<br>to celebrate Julie's huang's promotion<br>to Professor<br>and after so much disruption following<br>the covert pandemic or doing the covert<br>pandemic over the last two and a half<br>years it really is great to be able to<br>hold these lectures again<br>and indeed inaugural professorial<br>lectures are probably the highlight of<br>Our Lives as we get the chance to hear<br>about the research and the journeys of<br>our amazing staff<br>so today I'd like to welcome colleagues<br>from across the university as well as<br>students and friends but I'd like to<br>give a very special welcome to xi's<br>family and friends who've joined us this<br>evening in particular his wife Helen and<br>children Ruth hope and Samuel his sister<br>Aurora Wang brother-in-law Richard Zhang<br>and friend Zephyr and Alex Jimmer and<br>Tony and Julie's church friends who are<br>with us in person tonight<br>I'd also like to welcome his brother<br>ruhuang<br>his uncle haiming Hwang and niece Jenny<br>and other friends who are joining us<br>as some of you will know promotion to<br>professor at attargo is not an easy<br>thing to achieve<br>and in order to be promoted jeez had to<br>go on through a rigorous process where<br>he's been able to demonstrate that he's<br>achieved sustained outstanding<br>leadership in research teaching and<br>service<br>Professor Barker is going to shortly<br>introduce je formerly but I just want to<br>say a few words to set the scene<br>she is a computer scientist who is<br>interested in improving and at the<br>performance of computer systems and<br>particularly applying them in health<br>related Sciences<br>his work is wide-ranging and indeed I<br>first met ge when he was involved with<br>the project using eegs brain waves with<br>Liz Franz and psychology to be able to<br>control remote controlled toys with a<br>company in China<br>so he's been an excellent Ambassador for<br>us particularly as we've welcomed<br>Chinese visitors and dignitaries from<br>our sister city Shanghai<br>and I know that he's a passionate and<br>compassionate teacher not only of our<br>University students but also he's very<br>keen and willing to share his knowledge<br>with school-aged children to get them<br>interested in the discipline of computer<br>science<br>so congratulations Professor Huang on<br>your well-deserved promotion I'm really<br>looking forward to your lecture and I<br>know would like to welcome Professor<br>Richard Barker who's going to give a<br>formal introduction Cura<br>thank you<br>Professor Nicholson Tena Quay Professor<br>Blakey tianakwe Professor McClain Tina<br>Quay<br>Professor Wong tenakue<br>friends and colleagues Tina Koto<br>tenakoto tinakotakatawa it is my<br>pleasure to introduce our speaker<br>tonight<br>professori Wong to give his inaugural<br>prophesorial lecture at the University<br>of otago as indicated by Professor<br>Nicholson she is one of our newer<br>professors at the University having<br>received a well-deserved promotion to<br>the position in February this year<br>Joey's Hometown is shangtan a city in<br>East Central Hunan Province in South<br>Central South Central China this is also<br>the hometown of several founding leaders<br>of the Chinese Communist party including<br>Chairman Mao Zedong<br>reports that in childhood he worshiped<br>worshiped him very much these are his<br>own words<br>and that when Chairman Mao passed away<br>he was so sad that he cried for 10<br>minutes until everyone left the<br>classroom as he was hoping to meet Jim<br>and Mao someday<br>following his primary and secondary<br>education at which he excelled Professor<br>Huang studied for his bachelor's degree<br>in science at the National University of<br>Defense technology in the People's<br>Republic of China<br>to further his education he sought and<br>was accepted into a PhD at the<br>University of Amsterdam in 1989. but<br>alas this dream of attending this<br>University was shattered by the events<br>in tianman square on the 4th of June<br>1989. he reports that he couldn't get<br>his passport from the governor at the<br>time as the governor of the province was<br>instead dealing with protesters<br>following this disappointment Jo Yi<br>instead returned to the National<br>University of Defense technology where<br>he completed his PhD in 1992. this was<br>followed by a stint as Chief technical<br>officer for the mingxi electronic<br>technology company before taking up a<br>lectureship at the Beijing Institute of<br>Technology in the department of computer<br>science<br>in 1996 Professor Wong headed south to<br>take up the position of research fellow<br>at Griffith University in the school of<br>computing and information technology<br>before crossing the ditch to join the<br>University of otago as a lecturer in<br>August 1998 and my may I say what a<br>great year for joining the University of<br>otago<br>as we celebrate tonight Julie has<br>steadily worked his way up the ranks and<br>is now a full professor<br>as Professor Nicholson indicated to<br>become promoted to full professor at<br>University of otago is not easy<br>you must demonstrate all-round<br>excellence in each of the three academic<br>domains of research teaching and service<br>when the promotions committee assist<br>Professor huang's research record they<br>noted the volume of his output which at<br>the time was 137 peer-reviewed articles<br>two books teen edited books and five<br>book chapters and three of his papers<br>had been awarded the best paper award at<br>Major International conferences his hod<br>both then and now Professor McCain<br>tasted to the high quality of this work<br>as measured by the quality of the<br>outlets that this work has appeared in<br>one of the referees noted that Zhou is a<br>world-class researcher in computer<br>science particularly in distributed<br>Systems computer networking operating<br>systems and pattern recognition which<br>crosses multiple disciplines in computer<br>science another referee noted that he<br>has contributed contributed<br>significantly to the parallel and<br>distributed computing area playing a<br>lead role in this field in the Asia<br>Pacific region<br>leading by collaborating and encouraging<br>he co-founded the sun Microsystems<br>Center of Excellence at the University<br>of otago in 2007 which was one of seven<br>such centers around the world and the<br>only one outside the United States he<br>has since gone on to found and lead the<br>systems research group<br>Professor Huang is also a dedicated and<br>outstanding teacher his hod noted that<br>Professor Huang has developed more<br>papers in the department of computer<br>science than anyone else including a<br>second year paper which he developed and<br>has been a required second year paper<br>for approximately 20 years<br>he has maintained a very high<br>postgraduate supervisory load<br>consistently among the highest in the<br>department and because the topics he<br>teaches are very practically oriented he<br>personally spends significant time in<br>the teaching Laboratories<br>because of this commitment to teaching<br>he was nominated by his students from<br>otago University Students Association<br>teaching award in 2015.<br>standing out from his service record is<br>Yuri's commitment to outreach leading<br>the department of Computer Sciences<br>contributions to hand-on science now<br>hands on otago since 2010 and the otago<br>university Advanced school science<br>academy since 2017.<br>has also founded the haitu coding club<br>which caters to school students primary<br>intermediate and secondary interested in<br>Computing and personally runs to our<br>sessions each Sunday during term time<br>throughout the year<br>at the heart of his interest Professor<br>Huang is a computer scientist interested<br>in improving the performance of computer<br>systems in their applications<br>his work focuses on making computer<br>systems faster smaller more convenient<br>to use and more efficient<br>to hear more about this work let's<br>invite Professor Huang to the front<br>please join me in perfect in welcoming<br>Professor jerich one<br>thank you uh Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>Professor Dickerson<br>that'd be the vice Chancellor Professor<br>Blakey<br>and the provides Chancellor Professor<br>Parker<br>and my hod<br>associate in academic Professor McCain<br>thank you for your support<br>and thanks to all my colleagues<br>all my friends my family members<br>for your support and my relatives online<br>and my brother my uncle family<br>they are all at the moment watching<br>from online video<br>thank you all for your support<br>because my uncle doesn't know any<br>English<br>so I would like to say a few<br>Chinese words<br>also<br>uh<br>and also because of my childhood friends<br>they are also at the moment watching so<br>they want me to speak a few shantan<br>uh<br>okay my family was very poor and my<br>father thought they should not have any<br>children<br>after their first son was born<br>and so my mom kept having abortions one<br>after another<br>and she had two abortions before I was<br>conceived<br>and she used the same drugs<br>to trying to trying to abort me<br>but however to her surprise<br>I was not aborted after several attempts<br>on the country<br>she suffered a huge pain<br>she so she pleaded with my father<br>to allow her to keep me<br>though she seriously worried that I<br>could be disabled mentally<br>or spiritually<br>or physically<br>so after I was born she very often you<br>know every time when she remembered she<br>would declare to me the Lord of Heavens<br>was determined to save you<br>the Lord of Heavens was determined to<br>and this is my picture of when I was 100<br>years old<br>I was dressed up like a girl<br>because in the local tradition if you<br>dress up like a girl it's easy to raise<br>and this is my childhood picture<br>and here we have<br>I think here is the picture of my<br>uh me and my brother in front of my<br>grandpas<br>house I think you can see this as a clay<br>house<br>and me and my brother play chess and<br>this is the photo of me studying this is<br>a typical scenario when I was young I<br>was studying<br>in this kind of environment<br>and this is not a post picture it's a<br>picture of my father secretly took it<br>and this is the<br>chairman I worshiped for so many years<br>every year we have to go to Chairman<br>Ma's hometown and we take some pictures<br>so this is a very typical for most<br>Chinese children especially in my<br>province<br>some time flies when I was 16 I sit at<br>entrance examination to universities and<br>I got very high marks<br>so which enabled me to choose any<br>University in China like qingwa<br>University or Beijing University<br>and however my parents thought they<br>could not have food they travel and the<br>living cost<br>so they sent me to a university across<br>to my hometown<br>only one hour drive<br>I chose to study computer science though<br>at that time my<br>idea of computer is just like this a<br>calculator<br>so my University National University of<br>Defense technology and UDT was the only<br>University associated with the Chinese<br>Army at that time<br>when I entered this University my<br>department was developing its fastest<br>computer in China<br>it's called miyoki way and this Legacy<br>was carried on for decades and<br>eventually<br>it's supercomputer Galaxy 2 here in this<br>picture on the right<br>was listed for six times<br>as the Trope of the world 500<br>supercomputer<br>I was ranked the number one when I<br>entered the department and kept number<br>one for 10 years until I got my PhD on<br>the left<br>I was the captain of my class and the<br>latest student computer science Society<br>the official title is the president of<br>the postgraduate computer Society<br>and I swept all Awards and the<br>scholarships given to the best students<br>in that University<br>and here's a picture of me<br>I think a talking<br>in the in the party or in the<br>organization and this time playing Magic<br>to to a party I don't know what is about<br>I can't remember exactly was about but<br>it's a celebration<br>and this is the organization of the<br>computer Society the second term of is<br>symposium for postgraduates<br>and this is our football team so I was<br>actually a deputy captain<br>and our soccer team won the championship<br>and also sometimes we have some crazy<br>so at aoddd I was selected in the<br>research team led by the father of sugar<br>competing in China<br>so I was lucky to be in such a great<br>team and made excellent achievements<br>other students would have no chance<br>for example I was awarded the first<br>class research price of the commission<br>of science technology and Industry for<br>National Defense which was the highest<br>award in China and the many senior<br>researchers they dreamed to have<br>and this is<br>professor in kuwaits and this professor<br>saw was my uh advisor for my PhD<br>co-supervisor for my PhD and he was also<br>a professor at the Nyan Technological<br>and many of my peers are now generous<br>and who fellows in China I was one of<br>the national leaders of young computer<br>scientists those leaders are now in<br>prominent positions some of them are<br>presidents of universities<br>one of them is uh<br>the minister of Education in China<br>so since it's a bit sensitive to put the<br>pictures here because Holland reminded<br>me that this may be not a good situation<br>to put those pictures so I just leave it<br>blank<br>so I could have stayed at aodt but Helen<br>my wife dragged me away to Beijing she<br>could not bear the heat of my home<br>province<br>I have no regrets<br>the big the best gift God gave me<br>and nudity is Helen because she was the<br>best student among her peers and we got<br>married in her final year at the eodt<br>and it will be our 31st anniversary this<br>October<br>and here this is the Vienna highlighting<br>in front of the department building<br>and this is a wedding photo at my<br>hometown and this is the wedding Hotel<br>my awaiting photo at the Helen's home<br>now<br>so from this operating photos you can<br>so my research at Nutt was focused on AI<br>and then now is a very hot topic but it<br>was very hot too<br>simple AI in contrast to the now popular<br>connections connections AI<br>it was about using symbols to represent<br>the concepts in human mind and using<br>logic to simulate<br>uh simulate human reasoning so here in<br>this example actually<br>we could just create some logical rules<br>according to the human mind thinking and<br>the rule might be in general could be<br>if running then we stay a stay at home<br>and if it's sunny then we go out so this<br>is a very typical Choice people may take<br>and we have to generalize this kind of<br>rules and if we have facts say I was out<br>yesterday<br>and then the inference could be<br>yesterday was rainy right so there's an<br>easy logic influence but we could have<br>millions of rules such rules and those<br>rules could be conflict with each other<br>and one rule could be override the other<br>rule<br>so this is just something very difficult<br>to achieve in those days<br>and we have sometimes we have a high<br>level rules for example if we really<br>feel excited even if it's raining we<br>want to go outside right and sometimes<br>we get a spiritual inspiration and we<br>want to even if it's raining we want to<br>go out or praying or do something<br>special so it's very hard to generalize<br>these kind of rules<br>and the second one is collect all the<br>facts the data I think it's equally<br>important equally difficult nowadays to<br>connect the data for AI study<br>so these two factors actually are the<br>difficulties and the challenges in those<br>and the Japan launched his fifth<br>generation computer systems which is<br>based on the logic programming language<br>prologue China responded with the famous<br>863 program<br>and my PhD thesis was to analyze the<br>parallelism in prologue and make it<br>running in parallel it was my first time<br>learning C and creating a pre-created a<br>pre-compiler for prologue and the whole<br>system has more than 10 000 lines of<br>code and my work was published at the<br>prestigious Party Conference and got the<br>and this is a souvenir of of God because<br>the conference was in Amsterdam and they<br>have a 70 of small shoes wooden shoes<br>like this<br>and of course that the price also<br>consists of a thousand Euro in that case<br>it's a big money for a poor Chinese<br>student<br>so I finished my PhD institutions in<br>1992 and based on my work and the others<br>of my team we wrote two monograph books<br>with researchers from Nutt and qinghua<br>University one of them was<br>by the based publisher in China my<br>supervisor Professor who was a pioneer<br>of Chinese supercomputers<br>and in the same year Japan's fifth<br>generation computer system project was<br>declared as a value<br>and the symbolic AI was at its lowest<br>but regardless I had a very good<br>training at the audt apart from the AI<br>series I had a very good training on<br>computer engineering at iudt in a PhD<br>student had to implement a prototype<br>system if they propose a new computer<br>system no matter software or Hardware<br>this was very tough at those times and<br>by the PhD students in those days were<br>so at that time I didn't realize that I<br>was very privileged<br>especially I was at the top of the food<br>chain I didn't need to consider any<br>funding issue like that and the funding<br>so this is a picture of my professor my<br>my supervisor<br>professor husar and this is the English<br>so they are<br>those days they're working as a team to<br>so I feel frustrated about academic<br>research<br>because the failure of the symbiotic AI<br>I started a company called the means<br>with my classmates of the University<br>we developed an EEG analysis system<br>running on Windows I used artificial<br>intelligence like neural network<br>back propagation to classify the special<br>patterns of epileptic EEG so those kind<br>of different waves and we saw the system<br>to thousands hospitals after three days<br>and this is a<br>in the exhibition in me and it's just<br>showing the system to the public<br>and this is howling was joined me in<br>those days and helping us sometimes for<br>free basically and also giving a timer<br>such an experience allowed me to ship on<br>my students<br>my students childhood to start a company<br>called EEG Smart in China in 2014. the<br>company founded otago to develop a<br>prototype PCI system<br>and also our PCR research based on the<br>Prototype they have developed products<br>ranging from the PCI system<br>to sleep monitoring system so here you<br>can see digital devices used to do for<br>the BCI to control the Drone very small<br>drone and here it is just sleep<br>monitoring system<br>is much smaller device just stick on the<br>forehead<br>so in 1995 I got everything I wanted<br>money PhD fine a beautiful wife a happy<br>family<br>but I want you to see the world<br>our opportunity came to me in 1996 I was<br>employed as a postdoc at the University<br>at the Griffith University Australia<br>since then I got back to Academia<br>two years later the project was finished<br>and I moved to otago in 1998.<br>at that time I left I left my country<br>left my AI Circle<br>and a<br>left my Chinese academic academic<br>community<br>and everything I was familiar with<br>and that in that year I was already 33.<br>and I felt like<br>the little person here in front of the<br>I lost it again<br>because now I got a much larger family<br>and the second Hometown and also I've<br>got a<br>spiritual home<br>and here is this my family and this is<br>just<br>when we become a citizen of New Zealand<br>and we get the certificates<br>and this is the title actually make it<br>exactly right the scientists feel at<br>home so this is my home and also my<br>so I was recruited by Brian Cox so I'm<br>very grateful that Judy is here today<br>and<br>the the recruited team includes Ian<br>McDonald here and very much<br>very happy<br>and moved by you attending my IPL<br>and<br>the recruit gym includes Ian and also<br>Margaret Jeffries and they were very<br>kind to me when they interview me<br>and I got recruited<br>immediately and then I founded the otago<br>when I came there was no powerful<br>computer systems<br>or networks for research except the PCS<br>at that time I started everything from<br>scratch I moved to computer systems<br>research field and it shows cluster<br>Computing as my research<br>so basically that's not everything from<br>from Grand zero again<br>I was quite loaded in terms of research<br>at that time but luckily I forgot a year<br>who supported me spiritually and also<br>very often invited me to their home<br>groups so that's a huge relief<br>during the high pressure<br>and also Brian Cox supported me my first<br>ATM networks which is a powerful Network<br>used for research purpose and also can<br>connect many PCs together to do super<br>Computing work<br>and based on these devices<br>I<br>work with Professor Martin Purvis<br>and the Cameron Kerr was my teaching<br>fella who did the significant<br>contributions in the telecommunication<br>in the telecommunication program<br>and in those days I developed course 301<br>now in the past called<br>3301 but now called Coast 301 and the<br>course 244 and of course for to tell you<br>for to those papers and they'll still<br>remain and evolved until now<br>at that time my main research was do you<br>make many PCs working together<br>to achieve supercomputing power<br>since then I have managed to secure<br>fundings for powerful powerful computers<br>because my research about computer<br>systems is all about new computers if<br>you use other computers to do research<br>now the group has got a a server room<br>full of nautical computers<br>you can see these frames they are<br>actually a multiple multiple computers<br>some of them 64 calls some some of them<br>196 calls and also we got the gpus for<br>research related to computer systems and<br>AI<br>and the most importantly we have got a<br>more wonderful colleagues young<br>colleagues they their research is a<br>highly ranked in computer networks and<br>systems we have also got dozens of<br>so many thanks to our it support team<br>Alan Dave Tracy Kathy Malcolm<br>Malcolm Mills and Justin here especially<br>Alan who is always very kind and<br>cheerful trying his best to satisfy our<br>requests sometimes it's all very tough<br>requests<br>without their support it is impossible<br>to keep the<br>systems are up to date or running<br>and it is worth mentioning k<br>who is our administrator<br>who is very efficient and saved my time<br>in many administrative jobs<br>so I was lucky to have her as our<br>so for cluster Computing I proposed<br>and developed a parallel programming<br>system called vodka on cluster computers<br>it used to distributed shared memory<br>for parallel programming on cluster<br>computers<br>it is more convenient than using message<br>passing like MPI and the Vodka was used<br>by more than a dozen universities<br>including University of New South Wales<br>and the qinghua University<br>it had a better performance than the<br>world's leading trademark system<br>developed by Rice University led by<br>Professor Willis available<br>really moved to do epfl Switzerland<br>in 2004 because of water car I had<br>I had a connection with Willie and was<br>invited to epfl for my sabbatical leave<br>in 2005. but Willie moved away from<br>the cluster Computing area moved away<br>from distributed computing<br>and he also suggested me said change you<br>know this is no hope in this field<br>DSM is dead<br>so I Feel Again a bit frustrated so I<br>implemented uh vodka on Jin virtual<br>machine without any memory copy because<br>those days really moved to<br>virtualization and the thing was very<br>hot in those days so I have you know<br>familiar with and it was learning I<br>learned Jin the hypervisor<br>for<br>virtualization and also I have learned<br>uh Nina's kernel programming<br>from there and this enabled me the<br>capability of teaching kernel<br>programming<br>foreign<br>so<br>he's a very nice and kind<br>and this is my office at the EPF here I<br>should<br>confess that this office<br>is the largest office I ever had<br>so although I had a very good<br>publication based on vodka DSM systems<br>like vodka and the trademarks they were<br>not accepted by the industry due to its<br>lower performance than message passing<br>so you can see in this field even though<br>you propose some good idea is very<br>convenient but performance if it's not<br>good<br>it's not going to be used so performance<br>always the higher priority<br>so my research made another bottleneck<br>but however as the saying goes when God<br>since 2003 some Microsystems moved to<br>making multiple chips in 2006 they were<br>making multiple chips with up to 64<br>calls and this change in the chip<br>industry and the software development<br>and a single CPU is not going to<br>accelerate anymore due to physical<br>limitations<br>so all software will have to move to a<br>parallel Computing and this brought a<br>new chance for my research<br>and the Nicholas dirty uh he uses his<br>connection with some Microsystems to<br>start a company called word 45. and he<br>proposed to me and modern Purvis do you<br>collaborate with sound micro assistant<br>and due to my expertise in parallel<br>computing along with Nicholas I visited<br>some Microsystems a few times<br>presenting the case for our Target<br>after many efforts in 2008<br>otago became some Microsystems open<br>Spark Center of Excellence<br>which was the seventh<br>center of excellence and only one out of<br>outside United States<br>understood the person and Nicholas Dodi<br>they made a lot of effort for the<br>and the mountain where the chief<br>scientist and the marriage<br>marriage here he was also key<br>researcher and I'm very glad that my<br>research contributed to the<br>to the Coe<br>and here in the picture that I gave a<br>talk to the<br>sound Research Center and standing there<br>we have got a Marco Moyer and<br>the<br>Amorous honey Morris hurlinghi so these<br>are the father of transaction memory<br>in for some Microsystems so because of<br>those days would you for the convenience<br>of the system they use Hardware<br>adjustable to parallel Computing and<br>they propose transaction transactional<br>memory and which<br>so it was all good<br>in those days oh I forgot to mention<br>that Brendan was the<br>center of the manager of the center of<br>excellence<br>and suddenly uh<br>in 2000 2009 some Microsystems was<br>acquired by Oracle<br>and Oracle discontinued its production<br>so since then I my research moved<br>towards multiple Computing even the uh<br>it was a change of the<br>direction for some Microsystems we don't<br>use some Microsystems anymore so we move<br>this is a plug for the center of<br>excellence calling either<br>Center for Innovation building so if you<br>visit the building you can see on the<br>University<br>we proposed and implemented a view<br>oriented parallel programming system<br>for multiple clusters<br>it's called a multi and is more<br>convenient than MPI and the multi is the<br>you know mountain is the best alcohol in<br>China and the reason we name it the<br>multi is because we believe<br>Malta is better than vodka<br>so though this is just I think the<br>picture of Professor Zinn and the<br>professor<br>is the director<br>I think a standing director of Chinese<br>Federation of computer<br>and<br>Professor Zen is a fellow of Chinese<br>Academy of Sciences<br>so these are all important figures in<br>so though multi is accepted by Academia<br>you know we publish papers but in the<br>industry they either use MPI message<br>passing and not of convenient but the<br>performance is very good<br>or use Intel's over MP or MIT silk<br>or multiple computers and they are more<br>convenient than multi but cannot support<br>programming on cluster computers<br>so I've decided to seek collaboration<br>there's a picture of my family in<br>so in 2009 I visited MIT for six months<br>as a<br>visiting scientists professor Charles<br>licensing was my host I helped the<br>design of memory mapping<br>memory mapping for silk implementation<br>inside the ninet kernel<br>so here you can see that Silk actually<br>can call functions and make functions to<br>run in parallel and when the function a<br>call function B and C and the function B<br>and C can run in parallel at the same<br>time<br>so that they have to share the stack a<br>function a<br>at some stage and then she could just<br>support<br>two more tasks and DNE and then the<br>issue that share the stack of c and<br>there was a sheer stack of a<br>and there was other the kernel<br>programming support like memory might be<br>we may can't make it efficient and also<br>we want to make it interact with the<br>Legacy code<br>so we have a lot of traditional<br>traditional code and those lexicals need<br>to call Silk and silk should be able to<br>call them so this makes the<br>implementation very complicated<br>combining the complication inside the<br>I also created the profiling system for<br>the performance analysis so I read the<br>performance counters in the lens kernel<br>and give those data for performance<br>analysis<br>and also I can<br>analyze your profile in the<br>registers the performance counters<br>and analyze if they're following some<br>linear regression Trend to give some<br>predictions<br>also in MIT I learned a lot from Charles<br>in writing technical papers<br>and in MIT I think is also very<br>eye-opening to see how much resources<br>they have<br>so they actually have dozens of seminar<br>every day<br>and then lots of pieces before each<br>seminar<br>so you basically as a student you don't<br>need to go for lunch or dinner you just<br>and here I'm holding the MIT mascot<br>so several months after I left MIT I<br>received an email from the silk group<br>asked me do you help debug the system<br>with a tight time limit<br>I was very troubled with the request<br>because first it was not<br>my book it's not my code<br>second is very large system<br>that has more than 50 000 lines of code<br>just C code<br>and third I would feel sgm if I couldn't<br>if I promised and couldn't find the bug<br>it seems you know it's a kind of Chinese<br>typical thinking of face face losing<br>so the best way for me is to find the<br>excuse to decline the request<br>but somehow I promise to have a look so<br>I was in two days I found a bug<br>the first day was used to set up the<br>local environment<br>so that takes a lot of time in those<br>days I have to specially compile the<br>whole kernel which takes several hours<br>to finish<br>and the second day I pinpoint<br>they don't have these two assembly code<br>in the assembly code to be able to write<br>the content of at register into the<br>memory and later after<br>the application is finished<br>then they need to load the data back<br>from the memory back to the register<br>this is about the hand compilation so<br>you use some registers and if you mess<br>them up you have to store them in the<br>memory just in case later on you need to<br>use and then you reload it<br>but we don't have a full compiler yet in<br>those days<br>so everything's hand compiled so I<br>pinpoint this problem and fix it along<br>with many other<br>uh<br>many other bugs I mean some kernel also<br>is not fully working in those days<br>so<br>and this kind of experience is very much<br>like a looking for you know looking for<br>a needle in a haystack<br>so this is a even more challenging than<br>that because in this kind of problem the<br>needle is smart needle they sometimes<br>appear they sometimes disappear<br>so it's like a ghost on any ghost needle<br>and also the needle could be camouflaged<br>you know the heart itself and the change<br>appearance so that's very challenging<br>so needless to say I earned more respect<br>from the group after this<br>but however I should confess that I<br>prayed before<br>I took the job<br>about the MIT silk<br>uh it was later acquired by by Intel but<br>this continued in 2008 you can see the<br>industry is very cruel you know mitc was<br>to be very the best system in this field<br>but due to competition a lot of other<br>reasons and the political reasons<br>uh at the MRT I did a leadership<br>training<br>for yeah anyway so that's good I found<br>it very helpful<br>and also I learned the salary okay<br>that's really good I regret I didn't<br>grow up in the Western Country in the<br>United States or New Zealand otherwise I<br>would be a very very good sailor I<br>learned in three courses only and I can<br>just doing the talking<br>uh freely and I with my daughter's help<br>she didn't do anything so I was a little<br>bit arrested boat she didn't do any<br>calls but I just tell her what to do and<br>then we sell back and forth the Charles<br>also at the MIT I joined the parallel<br>and distributed operating system group I<br>learned a lot from them about operating<br>systems<br>especially the teaching operating system<br>called unique solution six xy6<br>but it was running on a simulated<br>environment called the qmu<br>I quoted xv6 to real PC and started<br>teaching OS with x16 adult tiger after<br>coming back to coming back from MIT<br>so I created the advanced operating<br>system paper called<br>in the practice of MIT<br>France and the robot they give me a lot<br>and actually you might be interested in<br>a robot with the inventor of the first<br>internet worm in 1998 which disrupted<br>hundreds of<br>data computers<br>so in those days uh<br>in my department the PC is not going to<br>be used even though I put the system to<br>PC and they turned to Mac everything's a<br>Mac so I can't use PC for teaching OS<br>anymore so I was looking for a small<br>computer called Raspberry Pi<br>so in 2013 I visited Cambridge<br>University for protein xy6 gear logical<br>Empire and Professor Robert Mullins<br>was my host he gave me all possible<br>support<br>I need to put xy6 on Raspberry Pi and he<br>was very kind analyzed rumors response<br>to my request immediately<br>such a protein job is very demanding but<br>rewarding I got a rich working knowledge<br>of computer architecture and always<br>the code the repository at the moment<br>I think it's still steadily and actively<br>used around the world so you can see<br>and from such experience<br>I also started teaching programming with<br>rotary pie and Arduino because I have<br>feel more comfortable with computer<br>architecture and computer hardware and<br>also started internet of things as a<br>research Direction because I also feel<br>along with cyber I feel more comfortable<br>with handling those hardware small<br>devices<br>and I spent about three months to<br>and since then I started my Outreach<br>experience<br>I started the high two coding club and<br>before that I learned a lot from Ian<br>Houston<br>who actually uh<br>taught me or basically we were called<br>co-leaders but actually I just watched<br>him is doing teaching Hands-On science<br>to high school students and I followed<br>him for several years before I started<br>my own project for oui SSA so I learned<br>a lot from there because initially I<br>would be scared to teach high school<br>students<br>and finally I started a high two coding<br>and in the protein job I also uh<br>I also have done the job in Shanghai<br>University<br>and the Shanghai Jordan University is my<br>long-term collaborator since 2010<br>we collaborated on multiple Computing<br>and its applications<br>the collaboration is very productive in<br>terms of Publications and top journals<br>and conferences and the train here in<br>the picture on the right is a student of<br>Professor Google<br>and he worked under my supervision for<br>and later on he graduated and then moved<br>to different universities and found in<br>Shanghai Jordan University and now he's<br>a professor so we keep the collaboration<br>for a long time<br>later on we have another student called<br>xiaoxing<br>who is working on image processing on<br>GPU and Stephen and David joined us and<br>we had a wonderful collaboration and<br>published several papers at the top<br>and the system research is all about<br>performance<br>so we normally use low-level performance<br>counters to find out the performance<br>problem and once we find it out we try<br>to figure out what should could be the<br>solution<br>so for example here you can see that the<br>curve is about speed up<br>the<br>in the x axis here is about the number<br>of course a number of processors<br>sometimes we call the CPUs so we have a<br>user up to 64 CPUs in this problem and<br>for this particular algorithm<br>when we're running on 64<br>processors we expect it should have<br>close to 64 times faster<br>compared to one CPU<br>okay but actually in reality we only get<br>about 10 tons<br>acceleration only 10 times that's very<br>low<br>and then this curve it's the one we<br>after we improve the performance by<br>using the fast memory and also by<br>changing the algorithm<br>either using smart algorithm to avoid<br>actually overhead and we get a super<br>skill<br>super skill<br>speed up in this case so you can see we<br>get about 200 times<br>of speed up compared with with a single<br>CPU<br>so this is the<br>our effort Maybe<br>the problem is this is different but the<br>curve is the same we always want the<br>curve to be upright<br>to be linearly increasing but of course<br>here you can see the it sometimes it's<br>get a bent bent it's not good we don't<br>want it to be bent we want to be always<br>straight up<br>so this is the effort we are doing for<br>system research we always pay a lot of<br>so without a powerful bare metal level<br>performance profiling it is not possible<br>to find the performance problems to<br>solve<br>and along with new computers this is the<br>capability of a leading system research<br>group<br>must have<br>and the picture<br>here is just uh the performance I've<br>so compare with limited resources I have<br>at the Target I together with my<br>collaborators<br>have achieved a lot in computer systems<br>for example parallel Computing multiple<br>Computing operating systems<br>but however I found there was a little<br>impact in New Zealand Society<br>no matter how good we feel about the<br>research overseas but actually in New<br>Zealand a lot of the public don't really<br>so it's very difficult also it's very<br>difficult to get a funded for system<br>research<br>so I decided to push and apply computer<br>and in 2014 funded by EEG smart<br>basically my student childhood<br>and leaves France and I worked on PCI<br>project<br>we collected motor imagination EEG data<br>and analyze a classification accuracy<br>and the VPN shipping were employed on<br>the postdoc and the research assistant<br>and the motor imagination is different<br>from person to person so if you have one<br>person to imagine the movement because<br>this kind of system is for disabled<br>people that's supposed to be cannot move<br>properly they are sometimes their neural<br>system has got a problem so they can't<br>use their hand to reach anything but<br>they can use imagination to imagine<br>their movement in their brain and we can<br>find out the brand signal but some<br>people can do it very well but some<br>people can't some people can reach about<br>90 percent accuracy some can only about<br>60.<br>and we found out the problem is kind of<br>crosstalk problem between the two sides<br>of the brain<br>just like if you want to move your hand<br>left hand at the same time you want to<br>move right hand for a different<br>different action like left hand moving<br>in circle the right hand move in square<br>I think it's very hard to do but it's<br>better to do this we're moving in the<br>same Circle or moving in square that's<br>easy so because of this kind of<br>crosstalk actually the classification<br>the signal between the left and the<br>right brain<br>is hard to distinguish so we found this<br>problem and get it published and that<br>you know and six years later actually<br>this publication so while warning I<br>wouldn't say is that for my fellow<br>colleagues if you want to start<br>cross-disciplinary research it's a very<br>challenging and risky<br>it takes much longer time<br>but as a byproduct<br>I designed the implement the mind<br>control system which is used as in many<br>situations in science events<br>and this kind of system is also used by<br>the brain health research center at the<br>moment this stands for outreaching and<br>that you get engaged with kids and<br>advertising brand knowledge<br>so then I also moved to a funding<br>biomarkers for depression using<br>artificial intelligence<br>the reason why I moved to this one is<br>because I have some friends<br>they suffer from depression and they<br>took the drugs and the drugs had a huge<br>side effect and sometimes they don't<br>know which drug is more suitable more<br>effective they have to try an error<br>trying the error and by the time when<br>they try it if it doesn't work they<br>suffer a lot<br>so we would like to find out the<br>biomarker if we found the biomarker we<br>will know if this drug really works<br>immediately from the brain waves so<br>that's the research<br>that's why I'm doing this kind of<br>research<br>and initially I worked with a new Phoebe<br>and Brandon and also pool glue<br>and we tried to apply for Marston five<br>times but eventually five times actually<br>we're getting a second round but<br>eventually we didn't get the final one<br>and now we joined the team John with<br>Veronica and Nara from psychology and<br>network and Divya from Neurosurgery<br>so we have got deal data at the moment<br>we got a very good classification<br>results we got more than 90 percent<br>classification accuracy at the moment<br>but we still got big trouble<br>oh by the way uh here we have got a<br>pastor PhD students like David and<br>Shanghai<br>they are working<br>in this project and also at the moment I<br>have got another student xiaohang is<br>working on it and our 400 level student<br>tire and Julius are working on it and<br>Natalia is working on the depression<br>data at the moment<br>he did a very good contribution and had<br>but the research is very challenging<br>because we use AI as connectionist AI<br>as I say the connection is AI<br>compared to a symbolic AI is that<br>they can automate the rule generation so<br>you don't need to worry about all those<br>rules leaking from Human mind they can<br>just generate a rules<br>directly from the data<br>the problem is we don't know what the<br>rules they use<br>it's like a black box<br>so for example here<br>for the images like you if you want to<br>train the model with a dog and a cat<br>basically you just train that train<br>amazing<br>bit sort of a beast<br>it's a dog dog<br>like that and eventually it will be you<br>know recognized most of the time say<br>this is a dog and then you can do the<br>same for the cat and then they will be<br>able to recognize cat<br>so this is the model<br>numerous nowadays works very well very<br>good very efficient but however the<br>model is not known clearly it's not<br>interpretable so far and people are<br>trying to do it trying to unlock the<br>Black Box<br>but however in our program we have even<br>more challenging<br>situation it's called the triple blind<br>problem<br>first the EEG data<br>we don't really know what the data<br>content<br>it's not just like this dog this cat<br>this data is depression data Maybe or is<br>related to depression even collected<br>from depressed people but may not be so<br>this is not very clear<br>and also the label here is not very<br>clear<br>how severe of the depression we don't<br>know<br>the at the moment is very subjective the<br>score is they feel a questionnaire and<br>then they give you a score and actually<br>I can trick it out I can make myself<br>I said depressed people if I want to<br>again I know exactly how to answer those<br>questions but I also can check it out<br>because make myself as a healthy people<br>you know if you really want to you<br>started those forms you could be able to<br>check it out so those labels is not very<br>reliable<br>and of course the third one the model is<br>not known even if you know the model you<br>don't know what kind of rules driving<br>them is a black box<br>so the pressure is very high but our<br>news has already been spread out<br>so this is a new starting point in my<br>career I don't know what will happen<br>next but I have taken the very<br>challenging task<br>and also this is my tuning server and<br>also is just my<br>most of my personal research theme does<br>not include my<br>colleagues<br>my colleagues research or student<br>research like hyper and Erwin they have<br>done wonderful research<br>and also GSN and leader and faiso and<br>the Kira there's our students are<br>so I'm very<br>different research projects so I didn't<br>include anything<br>in in this talk<br>and I would like to acknowledge my<br>colleagues my collaborators my students<br>and all my co-authors<br>yeah also I should say because I want to<br>sing a song to wrap it up<br>maybe you think I'm a very good singer<br>but actually not I'm very posing but<br>however I have got a wonderful church<br>family their brothers sisters they would<br>like to sing the song on my behalf<br>and a special thanks to Brian Cox who<br>brought me here<br>and my parents who brought me to this<br>world<br>and to my family Helen and my children<br>and also especially to Holland<br>who my wife who actually devoted all her<br>love to me<br>and the finally my Lord and My Savior<br>Jesus Christ<br>for his eternal love and salvation<br>man<br>always rejoices<br>thankful to you<br>I do not know where to go after that<br>um so my name is Brandon McCain I'm the<br>head of Department of computer science<br>and I've got a couple of jobs<br>so first I want to thank G for a<br>wonderful talk today and very<br>um<br>nice view of his progression through<br>life<br>um and it and most things have been said<br>but I wanted to highlight a couple I<br>think<br>um especially in relation to<br>um the computer science department so<br>gee since he's been here has had a<br>profound impact really on the department<br>especially in terms of teaching and<br>research in computer systems he sort of<br>LED this group he's been a very strong<br>proponent of the importance of computer<br>systems teaching in our curriculum and<br>this has been maintained through the<br>whole time that he's been here really<br>and as he said he started<br>um up the systems research group and<br>he's really considered<br>um a father figure in this in the<br>systems research group so not into not<br>just in terms of his work in his<br>research and his teaching but also all<br>the things that happen after hours so in<br>developing the group and the people in<br>the group that have joined both students<br>and staff so things like<br>um helping new members get New Zealand<br>driver's license and helping them around<br>town to find a house you know to buy and<br>um and one thing I really do want to<br>focus on is that importantly geez<br>genuinely a very good person so we've<br>seen that his Christian faith is a core<br>part of his being but his moral core I<br>think is even stronger than that so<br>despite his research seeming to focus on<br>um a fair amount of booze vodka and Mao<br>Thai I've never seen him have a drink<br>actually so I don't think he he likes<br>that<br>um<br>um very much but his moral core stands<br>out very strong and this is um how he<br>deals with all the people really in his<br>life and I want to sort of finish off<br>with a quote that I gathered from<br>one of the members of the group<br>and it goes like this<br>says he is one of the best friends<br>colleagues group leaders who is the most<br>trustable kind and helpful person and I<br>think you really couldn't ask for a<br>better testimonial than that<br>so<br>um<br>I'm keeping it fairly short because<br>we're kind of running a bit late on time<br>but I want to thank ji very much for his<br>contributions to the department and to<br>the university and I have<br>a gift for<br>gee<br>so thank you very much<br>and thank you all for coming<br>um and thank you to the people who<br>joined us online and I'd like to invite<br>you all to the staff Club we're going to<br>have some refreshments<br>um I don't know if there will be any<br>vodka or Mao Thai there<br>but uh<br>we'll be able to<br>um have a drink of something at least so<br>thank you very much and thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
