great<br>pleasure to be here today to celebrate<br>the promotion to Professor of Simon<br>Stevens<br>and as as some of you will be aware or<br>many of you will be aware we've had with<br>our program of inaugural Professor or<br>lectures we've had quite a lot of<br>disruption over the past year or two and<br>the good news is that we're busy<br>catching up at the moment and it's been<br>wonderful to be part of these events in<br>fact we had four last week would you<br>believe and that's uh we've been running<br>about two to four for most weeks<br>recently and uh for an absolute<br>highlight of my role is to be able to go<br>around and hear what's happening around<br>uh incredible institution amongst from<br>some amazing people and and continues<br>tonight so one of um my main role is to<br>uh to welcome everybody and uh welcome<br>everyone who's come here in person but<br>we also have<br>uh people will be watching online either<br>live or delayed and that's been uh huge<br>I think to be able to access these<br>events online at the moment so welcome<br>everybody welcome everyone from<br>university community the the city and<br>Beyond but I do want to give a special<br>well some special welcome to Simon's<br>whanau and friends and I understand here<br>tonight I have met son Leo<br>so welcome but I understand that Simon's<br>partner Rebecca is here tonight Rebecca<br>and uh John heighten I think is a key<br>Mentor John nice to see you again but<br>also<br>um a few people watching online I gather<br>because of the time zone there'll be a<br>few of them we may be watching it<br>delayed but that's uh to Sam's parents<br>uh brother sister maybe others who are<br>online so big big welcome to everyone<br>it's wonderful to have you here<br>now I'm going to hand over shortly to<br>Joe Baxter who'll give a more detailed<br>uh introduction to to Simon and his<br>career but I just really just want to<br>make a point at this stage just to the<br>comment<br>um Simon is a clinical academic clinical<br>researcher and um see looking at his CV<br>is someone who's highly productive and I<br>must say that's it's characteristic of<br>so many of our clinical researchers that<br>the combined very busy clinical roles<br>with very active and very productive<br>research careers and certainly Simon<br>appears to have had that for sure and I<br>just also acknowledge<br>um you know his interest as a<br>rheumatologist into some pretty complex<br>and then chronic conditions and that<br>brings many challenges and so really<br>just to acknowledge that before passing<br>over to Joe but big congratulations<br>Simon on your your promotion very much<br>looking forward to your lecture and I<br>manage<br>and<br>a huge Mahi and greetings to you all and<br>it isn't it is indeed a privilege for me<br>to stand up here and have the<br>opportunity to introduce Professor Simon<br>stevings in this his inaugural<br>professorial lecture so as David Murdoch<br>has said I'm Joe Baxter I'm the new Dean<br>of the Dunedin school of medicine and<br>one of the Privileges that one gets in<br>the in becoming a Dean is the<br>opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate<br>the achievements of our key staff in the<br>school and so it is intense privilege<br>and honor to have this opportunity today<br>and before introducing Simon I really do<br>want to acknowledge again what David has<br>already mentioned which is the<br>contribution that our clinical<br>researchers and clinical academics make<br>and I know that not only are you making<br>a difference out there working with<br>individuals whanau communities<br>supporting the health and Health Care<br>needs of many people but you're also<br>engaging with teaching and learning for<br>our next generation of doctors and also<br>very much contributing in terms of<br>research and in particular over this<br>time of covert I know that all of those<br>things have had an increased level of<br>pressure and so I do want to thank you<br>and acknowledge you for the wider work<br>that you do<br>so in terms of Simon and we had a lovely<br>meeting to talk about this and I don't<br>want to steal his Thunder because his<br>presentation is about his journey but<br>um in terms of introduction Simon is a<br>rheumatologist and head of the<br>Rheumatology Research Unit in the<br>department of medicine and the Dunedin<br>School of Medicine<br>as researchers focused on<br>spondyloarthritis which is a common<br>inflammatory arthritis of the spine<br>Simon Simon has studied the genetic<br>basis of this condition through<br>International collaborations which have<br>led to new tools for early diagnosis is<br>also extensively researched the role<br>that the immune system and gut bacteria<br>play and the development and<br>perpetuation of spondyloarthritis<br>he has been the New Zealand<br>representative on a board developing<br>guidelines for managing<br>spondyloarthritis across the ASA Pacific<br>region and his other research focus is<br>through a long-standing collaboration<br>with the psychology department<br>investigating the impact of fatigue and<br>most recently the effects of covid-19<br>pandemic on people with arthritis<br>so today's talk has an intriguing title<br>which I won't talk more about because I<br>know that Simon may be likely to explain<br>about it but he will take us on his<br>journey in medicine Rheumatology and<br>research and he will talk about his re<br>his research and about the contribution<br>he's made alongside colleagues to<br>understanding the genetic and<br>environmental factors that lead to the<br>development of the condition I really<br>look forward to hearing more about your<br>journey and to hear more about your<br>research so without further Ado I'd like<br>to welcome you Simon Stebbins to deliver<br>Tina Koto tinakoto tinakoto Katara<br>welcome everyone and thank you for<br>coming along tonight and it's great to<br>see some familiar faces out there<br>um so uh I'm going to talk a little<br>about my career and when I talked to a<br>friend about what I was going to talk<br>about tonight he said so you have 45<br>minutes to talk about your whole career<br>and I nodded and he said so how will you<br>fill the last half hour<br>but uh I'll try my best and I'll start<br>off just by talking a little bit about<br>the title of my talk so I hope nobody's<br>come along expecting a talk about Luna<br>exploration but the the title comes from<br>Shakespeare<br>and uh in Midsummer Night's Dream the<br>quote is therefore the moon the<br>governess of floods pale in her anger<br>washes all the air that Rheumatic<br>diseases do abound<br>and Shakespeare knew that Rheumatic<br>diseases did indeed abound and I know<br>that from my clinical and research work<br>and you might think it's a little<br>pretentious starting off with<br>Shakespeare but I'll explain why<br>Shakespeare is important to me as we go<br>through<br>good so um I was like to let people know<br>what they're going to expect with a talk<br>so that they can work out how much<br>longer there is to go<br>um so I'm going to start with a little<br>bit of philosophy and then my journey<br>into medicine my journey through<br>medicine as a doctor then my journey<br>into research<br>a little bit about teaching and then<br>finishing up with a bit more philosophy<br>so um usually when it comes to a career<br>I think we all like to think about our<br>careers perhaps following this<br>trajectory here we've got distance<br>traveled in our career over time and<br>it's a nice linear Journey but my<br>journey was a bit more like this ECG<br>tracing here it's a bit more up and down<br>um so<br>I promise to start with a bit of<br>philosophy and uh Jean-Paul Sartre who<br>was an existentialist<br>um had this to say he said each choice<br>we make in life defines as well at the<br>same time revealing to us what we think<br>it is to be human so the choices that we<br>make Define Us in life and I suppose<br>that defines my career and also some of<br>my passions so outside medicine and<br>research my passions I suppose are<br>literature and music<br>particularly in terms of music what<br>Apple iTunes might unfortunately term<br>alternative stroke Punk<br>so I've tried to frame Jean-Paul Sartre<br>in ways that I understand because I'm<br>not very good at philosophy and two<br>people have helped me one is the Talking<br>Heads one of my favorite bands and they<br>said and you may ask yourself how did I<br>get here and the answer to that comes<br>from a book by one of my favorite<br>authors Kurt Vonnegut who says I was a<br>victim of a series of accidents as are<br>we all<br>and the first accident that any of us<br>have is our accident of birth so this is<br>my family here and this is a holiday<br>early on as you can see this is my uh<br>mother and father my mother was born in<br>skegness and this is our holiday in<br>skegness here which is a beautiful<br>Resort town on the North Coast of of<br>Lincolnshire between cleethorpes and<br>mabelthorpe and my mother was born here<br>and then she became a radiographer later<br>in life and she was the rock of our<br>family and this is my father here he was<br>a general practitioner and one of the<br>first people to start a health center in<br>England and when I was growing up I<br>watched the health center being being<br>developed and built and I think that was<br>a big influence on me wanting to become<br>a doctor<br>um as you can see my sister is a bit<br>older than me she trained to be a<br>teacher and in the holidays I was her<br>um sort of<br>working job really so uh when I'd be<br>asked to provide something on a page for<br>the teacher about what we did in our<br>holidays most people produced like one<br>page about what they did but my sister<br>would sit over me for the entire holiday<br>and make sure that I did something every<br>day so I'd have a kind of War and Peace<br>to present to the teacher at the end of<br>it so she's quite a hard task master<br>really and this is my favorite picture<br>of me on a horse or a Shetland pony I<br>think it was six months to go all the<br>way along the skegness beach and I have<br>a look of grin determination on my face<br>there which which I think stood me in<br>good stead<br>um so and then I've missed out my<br>brother here Paul and so he gets a slide<br>to himself<br>so my brother Paul is an artistic<br>director of TNT theater and I recently<br>saw his production of Othello he<br>specializes in Shakespeare produces<br>Shakespeare all over the world and this<br>is his favorite picture of himself in<br>front of Buckingham Palace holding his<br>MBE for services to the theater and<br>haven't we heard a lot about that<br>um so<br>um that was that was my family and I<br>grew up in in Nottingham that's where I<br>was born<br>and this is the school I went to<br>Nottingham High School I took this<br>picture when I was 18. I had slightly<br>ambivalent view of school at that time<br>as you can see from this picture I think<br>I've been listening to Too Much Joy<br>Division<br>and but when I look back it was a was a<br>very good school and in particular I<br>remember one teacher who was Mr William<br>Ruff my English teacher who really<br>instilled in me a passion for for<br>literature at least with some of the<br>books that he introduced me to and he<br>really wanted me to go to university and<br>study literature but I stuck to my guns<br>I wanted to do medicine he couldn't<br>really understand that particularly as I<br>was very very bad at all the subjects<br>that you needed to get into medical<br>school and unfortunately at the end of<br>my time at school I did very well in<br>English but very badly in chemistry<br>biology physics and maths and I didn't<br>get into medical school so I couldn't<br>stay on at school so so um my choices<br>were limited but fortunately there was<br>somewhere that saved me and that was the<br>People's College of further education<br>and if you don't believe that that<br>really existed there's the report card<br>from there so People's College was this<br>sort of building here a very 60s<br>institution and I had an interesting<br>year there so this was how I started out<br>from school and this is how I ended up<br>at the end of the year I think I<br>developed some attitude<br>but uh needless to say<br>um fortunately I did get sufficient<br>grades at the end of that year to to be<br>let into medical school and a very<br>obscure medical school in London<br>accepted me called the Middlesex<br>Hospital medical school<br>um at this time there was quite a major<br>reorganization happening in London<br>medical schools that started off being<br>12 of them and by the end of my time in<br>London there were only four and our<br>school was Amalgamated into University<br>College London at the end of my second<br>year and the name of Middlesex Hospital<br>was no more and in fact this is where<br>the Middlesex Hospital medical school<br>was it's now a huge hole in the ground<br>so not only has the name gone but all<br>the buildings have been demolished as<br>well<br>so um I ended up in this much larger and<br>some would say more prestigious medical<br>school that's me on the back row of our<br>year photo and this is University<br>College Hospital there<br>um I can't say I enjoyed my time at<br>Medical School very much at all actually<br>and that was for a number of reasons<br>firstly we didn't have a curriculum so<br>um I'd often ask you know what are we<br>supposed to learn and they just say well<br>you have to learn everything which<br>wasn't very helpful really<br>and then the main way that we were<br>taught was through a kind of ritual<br>humiliation so you go on to the ward and<br>then people who are much more<br>experienced than you consultants and<br>Senior registrars would ask you<br>questions that you didn't know the<br>answer to and then humiliate you in<br>front of patients nurses student nurses<br>and their colleagues so it was rather a<br>miserable experience I'd have to say<br>except for one bright spark of three<br>months and this was another peoples I<br>had three months overseas as an elective<br>in the People's Republic of China China<br>was a very different place when I was<br>there in 1987 and this was at the<br>sunyatsen University of medical Sciences<br>where I studied infectious diseases for<br>three months with this gentleman here<br>Professor Herr and Professor Herr was<br>the only person that I remember in my<br>whole of my medical school time who was<br>respectful kind helpful and taught me<br>things so I have a great<br>great memories of Professor Herr and I<br>think that he had humility and he had<br>kindness which were probably bred into<br>him by having survived the cultural<br>revolution which was very different<br>experience from the people who taught me<br>in London who had a lot of hubris<br>so at the end of my time at Medical<br>School<br>I did manage to to graduate just and I<br>wasn't a very good student but I went<br>from one day being a medical student to<br>the next day being Dr stebbing's House<br>officer and this was a huge jump really<br>it was like being told you can suddenly<br>fly a plane when you'd never been off<br>the ground<br>and um<br>I like this quote from Dickens which is<br>probably very familiar to many people it<br>was the best of times it was the worst<br>of times which it certainly was but the<br>quote goes on it was the age of wisdom<br>it was the age of foolishness it was the<br>spring of hope it was the winter of<br>Despair and that really sums up about<br>the first three years of my time as a<br>doctor<br>but this was the contents of my pocket<br>here so we had to wear white coats at<br>the time and this book here really<br>helped me to to get through things the<br>Oxford Handbook of clinical medicine<br>told me everything I needed to know and<br>I had a little notebook this really is<br>true this is the actual thing I had in<br>my pocket and it said don't panic in<br>large friendly letters that says<br>reminder here on the side and every time<br>I had to do a scary procedure I'd look<br>at this and it would help to calm me<br>that in an experienced nurse got me<br>through many uh many scrapes but um<br>although it was a very challenging time<br>it was a very strangely enjoyable time<br>so this was the first hospital I worked<br>at Saint Andrews Hospital Beau in London<br>if you did well in your exams you got to<br>go to places like Saint Bartholomew's<br>hospital or the Royal free hospital if<br>you didn't do so well you got sent to a<br>very old Victorian workhouse which<br>sprawled across the East End of London<br>most of which had empty rooms but I had<br>a fantastic team there and at the end of<br>of three months I decided for certain<br>that I wanted to be a hospital physician<br>and doctor<br>that was despite working 100 hours a<br>week on average and uh living in the<br>hospital so one of the great uh great<br>advantages of working such long hours<br>was they gave you free accommodation in<br>the Victorian workhouse and this is<br>where I lived up here in the Attic a<br>vast room which had a tiny single bed a<br>telephone and a lamp so you could answer<br>your your pager<br>of course this is it being slightly<br>demolished now so like my medical school<br>it no longer exists but it was a very<br>um<br>very important time for me and after<br>this I got to work at a number of other<br>old work houses and TB hospitals around<br>London nothing very prestigious<br>unfortunately and during that time I had<br>to to study for my college exams to<br>become a physician and unfortunately it<br>took me five goes to get my membership<br>of the Royal College of Physicians of<br>London which is this building here and<br>subsequently when I came to New Zealand<br>they were very kind to let me into the<br>Royal australasian College of Physicians<br>and that's the the Garment I'm wearing<br>today the academic Robes of the college<br>in memory of the difficult times I had<br>in getting that exam<br>um but then uh something changed for me<br>which really was life-changing and um<br>this happened in 1991 so you might<br>recognize this man here it's Freddie<br>Mercury and in November 1991<br>um he released a press release<br>and it went like this following enormous<br>conjecture in the Press I wish to<br>confirm that I have been tested positive<br>for HIV and have AIDS the times now come<br>from my friends and fans around the<br>world to know the truth and I hope<br>everyone will join with me my doctors<br>and all those worldwide in the fight<br>against this terrible disease and this<br>was uh really struck a chord with me<br>because at the time there was so much<br>stigma against people who had AIDS not<br>only in the Press they called it the gay<br>plague but amongst medical practitioners<br>too and I felt very strongly about this<br>that I wanted to do something to help<br>so to put this into context we tend to<br>forget about this but since the<br>beginning of the epidemic of HIV nearly<br>80 million people have been infected<br>with HIV and of those 36 million people<br>have died from AIDS around the world<br>this is what was happening at the time<br>in London we can see here that when I<br>decided to work on an HIV Ward this was<br>really at the peak of the epidemic with<br>the peak number of deaths that were<br>happening and most people who contracted<br>AIDS at that time were were gay men<br>except in Edinburgh if you've ever seen<br>the movie or read the book of<br>Trainspotting you'll know that Edinburgh<br>was the place where intravenous drug<br>users mostly had AIDS but in London it<br>was mostly gay men<br>so I elected to to work at one of the<br>two AIDS units in London there was one<br>at my former medical school and one at<br>Saint Stephen's clinic at the<br>Westminster Hospital which is where I<br>worked and this was really a very<br>challenging time for me I spent a year<br>there I watched a lot of patients come<br>through and most of them during that<br>period died from AIDS it was a very<br>horrible death many of the patients<br>were so horribly stigmatized that they<br>didn't tell their friends or family<br>about their disease or why they were in<br>hospital but many of them had had a<br>great sense of humor and um a Gallow<br>sense of humor really and many of them<br>became very well known to me<br>but it was a very traumatic time we had<br>a lot of personal<br>risk too because we were doing a lot of<br>invasive procedures and we knew that if<br>we stabbed ourselves with a needle at<br>that time then<br>we ourselves would contract HIV and as<br>we thought at the time everybody who had<br>AIDS died so it was a traumatic time we<br>didn't have any sort of counseling or<br>support<br>um<br>but memories are short really and uh and<br>I was rather annoyed uh to say the least<br>to to read things in the newspaper<br>recently to say that the covid pandemic<br>was the first pandemic in living memory<br>it's like all this never happened of<br>course medical advances mean that nobody<br>dies from AIDS now it's a chronic<br>disease which is fantastic but it's<br>saddens me that we've already forgotten<br>about this epidemic and what it did to<br>people<br>um so at the end of this time I couldn't<br>really settle back into to general<br>medicine<br>um so I sold my house and car and I went<br>on a big Journey Overland and I went to<br>some extremely isolated places uh before<br>ending up after about nine months in New<br>Zealand and uh I needed to get a job<br>because I'd run out of money by that<br>time<br>and fortunately they offered me a job at<br>Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Rotorua<br>which is the only dedicated Rheumatology<br>and Rehabilitation Hospital in New<br>Zealand and that was a fantastic year I<br>learned a lot about auditing and<br>evidence-based medicine there about<br>Rehabilitation and I developed a love<br>for New Zealand as well and at the end<br>of the year I'd got enough money to pay<br>for my return trip home and I was just<br>about to go and buy that ticket when<br>this gentleman here who I think is in<br>the audience<br>um actually gave me a phone call out of<br>the blue I never met him in my life but<br>he phoned up and he said hello it's John<br>Hayton here I'm looking for somebody to<br>help me with my research do you want to<br>come down to Dunedin and since I hadn't<br>got any other offers I thought well that<br>sounds like a reasonable thing I won't<br>go home after all I'll try try Dunedin<br>so I went down to Dunedin and that's<br>where I started to uh to develop my<br>interest through John in ankylosing<br>spondylitis<br>so Ankylosing Spondylitis is a disease<br>which affects the spine and this is a<br>famous photograph of a man over many<br>years and what Ankylosing Spondylitis<br>can do<br>it causes deformity and extreme Pain and<br>Disability it's a devastating disease<br>unfortunately with with modern treatment<br>we can really prevent this from<br>happening which has been fantastic<br>that's happened in my practicing<br>lifetime<br>this is a bone scan which just shows the<br>degree of inflammation that can happen<br>in the spine throughout the spine and<br>the sacraliac joints the extent of<br>inflammation that people with this<br>condition have<br>what we know about this and have known<br>since 1973 is that it's strongly<br>genetically determined disease so twin<br>studies show that there's a strong<br>concordance between identical twins and<br>as as you fall off from the distance of<br>relatedness from brothers and sisters<br>and mothers and fathers your risk Falls<br>significantly so there's a strong<br>genetic aspect but that's not the whole<br>story there's something else that's<br>going on as well and what we have<br>thought for a number of years is that's<br>some kind of microbial trigger and one<br>of the reasons for that is reactive<br>arthritis which is also part of the same<br>spectrum of disease as Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis is triggered by known<br>organisms which you might have heard of<br>campylobacter salmonella shigella<br>dysentery so we know that some bacteria<br>can trigger this type of arthritis<br>furthermore if we take rats that have<br>been made transgenic for human B27 and<br>they're brought up in germ-free<br>conditions they won't get arthritis but<br>if they are exposed to bacteria they get<br>this arthritis very like humans<br>so um I was lucky I got a traveling<br>fellowship and did a master's degree<br>with with John and Gerald tanak who was<br>an expert in the intestinal microbiome<br>this was some of my I throw nothing away<br>as you can see this is all my lab books<br>from the time and what we did was we<br>looked for a year at the intestinal<br>microbiome in patients with Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis so<br>it might to disturb you to think just<br>how many bacteria there are in our gut<br>there are more bacteria in the gut than<br>there are cells in the human body and<br>over 500 different species and these<br>tend to be quite stable during life<br>so what we wanted to find out was what<br>was happening to these bacteria if they<br>were different in patients with<br>Ankylosing Spondylitis to healthy people<br>and in order to do that we needed to<br>collect fecal samples and this was not<br>particularly popular with one of our<br>staff here which is uh Judith mcphail<br>our nurses I think in the audience today<br>so Judith was used to dealing with<br>people with arthritis not with a large<br>tsunami of fecal specimens arriving on<br>her doorstep every day but she was very<br>very<br>uh stoical about that and very helpful<br>we used to culture some of these this is<br>a culture of sulfate bacteria from the<br>stool but we had quite a a wonderful and<br>at that time very uh up to the minute<br>technique called dgge where we got these<br>beautiful<br>readouts of all the different bacteria<br>that were in a patient's fecal specimen<br>and as you can see each person has a<br>unique<br>um sort of fingerprint of their bacteria<br>so their bacteria tend to be stable over<br>time and unique to that person<br>and although we didn't find any<br>difference between the control group and<br>our Ankylosing Spondylitis patients it<br>was the first time anybody really looked<br>at this in Ankylosing Spondylitis and it<br>took a very long time to to get a<br>journal to accept this but uh ultimately<br>it got cited a lot of times and I ended<br>up having to peer review about 10 years<br>later when this became a trendy topic<br>all the papers that have been recently<br>written because nobody else had ever<br>published on this so it was quite<br>gratifying and at the end of that time I<br>had to decide whether I was going to go<br>back to England or not so in the words<br>of of the Clash should I stay or should<br>I go<br>and uh in the end I did a bit of both I<br>went back to England and then I came<br>back to New Zealand uh when I was<br>appointed as a senior lecturer and the<br>University was very gracious they gave<br>me an early career researcher Grant and<br>I did some more work with Gerald and<br>John and we looked at<br>the immune response to autologous that's<br>the patient's own bacteria both in in<br>patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis and<br>controls and in this study which again<br>was quite a quite a gratifying one we<br>found that patients with Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis didn't mount an<br>anti-inflammatory response like um like<br>healthy people did which suggested that<br>they'd lost tolerance to the bacteria in<br>their gut and we wondered if we could<br>take that a bit further by making their<br>gut bacteria healthier so to do that we<br>did a study of probiotics and this was<br>with my colleague Katie Jenks who about<br>10 years after me did a master's project<br>with me and we looked at giving a<br>probiotic to patients with Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis with a common bacteria that<br>you'd find in in yogurt lactobacillium<br>bifidobacteria to see if this would be a<br>treatment for ankylosing spondylitis and<br>this is what we found uh week four they<br>were neck and neck week 12 placebo group<br>was a bit uh ahead and at week 16<br>um there was no difference so<br>unfortunately probiotics were not um<br>we're not the treatment of choice for<br>Ankylosing Spondylitis and all the<br>shares I bought in probiotics who were<br>worthless<br>but after this<br>um<br>I decided that we needed to to go a bit<br>bigger so I started up a group called<br>the spondylarthritis genetics and the<br>environment study group and this was a<br>group of of the Willing really around<br>New Zealand so fortunately all the major<br>centers all my Rheumatology colleagues<br>decided to to help out with this and<br>over a period of five years we collected<br>300 patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis<br>and we were able to follow them yearly<br>for five years and we collected material<br>for genetic analysis<br>so this was a big project and it<br>certainly wasn't just me so this is a<br>picture of some of our teams some of the<br>rheumatologists around New Zealand and<br>particularly important were two people<br>here there's Deborah McNamara who was<br>our research nurse who recruited<br>patients and did their measurements and<br>this was Mary Wallace in the lab who<br>extracted all the genetic material and<br>sent that off for analysis into our<br>International collaborators<br>but we uh we wanted to look at a few<br>different things we got a bit sick of<br>collecting uh fecal samples I think<br>Judith drew the line there too<br>um so we thought we'd have a look at<br>dysbiosis that means A disruption of the<br>healthy microbiome in the mouth instead<br>so we were able to have a great<br>collaboration with the dental school at<br>this point and we looked at periodontal<br>disease so if you ever go to the dentist<br>and they whip out these instruments here<br>they're going to shove it up into your<br>Garmin measure to see if your gums are<br>healthy so we did that and then we<br>collected microbial material from those<br>interdental pockets as well<br>we had some interesting results we found<br>that activity of disease and Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis mirrored the amount of<br>periodontal disease so that had never<br>been shown before that was quite<br>interesting and we were able to send off<br>the microbial material to collaborators<br>in Canada who had the sort of next phase<br>of microbial analysis so you can go from<br>culture to the dgge that I did when I<br>was doing my masters to to this which is<br>the latest way of looking at it so this<br>is a heat map showing all the different<br>bacteria in the pocket and these are<br>sort of diversity indexes showing<br>whether different patients have a<br>different diversity to their bacteria<br>and the answer to that was no there was<br>no difference again between controls and<br>and the patient group but what it did<br>show me was that this was extremely<br>expensive<br>um and difficult line of research to do<br>so I decided at that point to to draw a<br>line under microbial investigation<br>so we did some clinical studies we we<br>validated this<br>questionnaire here looking at bowel<br>symptoms and this was quite interesting<br>we wanted to see if patients had<br>clinical symptoms of bowel disease even<br>though they they had Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis because of this overlap<br>between inflammatory bowel disease and<br>Ankylosing Spondylitis and reactive<br>arthritis and we found that in fact<br>indeed patients with spondylo arthritis<br>fell somewhere between patients with<br>inflammatory bowel disease and healthy<br>people and that this was linked with<br>disease activity too so those were<br>interesting things that we we found and<br>we also um we didn't give up on stools<br>completely we just gave people this<br>chart here to stick on their toilet door<br>you can try this at home you can you can<br>grade your stools on the Bristol stool<br>chart and then send them in as our<br>patients did for a week and we found<br>that our patients with Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis had had increased stool<br>frequency and loose stools compared with<br>with the control group but not as bad as<br>people who'd had true gut inflammation<br>with inflammatory bowel disease<br>and this kind of stayed pretty stable<br>over the course of our study up to 60<br>months really so bowel symptoms hadn't<br>previously been noted to be a problem in<br>patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis so<br>this is quite gratifying to find<br>and then of course we collected all the<br>genetic material so<br>I've talked about hlab27 which is the<br>strongest risk factor for Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis and it was for a Time<br>thought this was the single Gene that<br>was involved but we now know that there<br>are over 150 additional risk genes which<br>can contribute to Ankylosing Spondylitis<br>and I was very lucky to collaborate with<br>an International Group which was a very<br>high profile submitting our patients<br>genetic material and clinical data and<br>we were able to<br>work out multiple risk variants<br>within the genome for Ankylosing<br>Spondylitis and ultimately most recently<br>to develop a risk score which might be a<br>way of identifying patients who have<br>Ankylosing Spondylitis from their<br>genetic profiling<br>um and then we kind of formulated a<br>theory about dysbiosis and homeostasis<br>and gut inflammation and and genetics<br>was an interesting project to do to try<br>and put everything together after a<br>number of years of research<br>so that's a little clue into my my<br>research background I just wanted to<br>finish off with a few things about<br>teaching because sometimes that seems to<br>be put to the side a little bit in in<br>the university and it's such a core part<br>of what we do and a core interest of<br>mine so<br>um I think it is a big responsibility<br>the the medical Council says that<br>medical students are tomorrow's doctors<br>which is very true and what we have to<br>do is to make sure that they know that<br>the care of the patients it's their<br>first concern that they act in a<br>professional and ethical Manner and that<br>they take responsibility for their<br>actions in often complex and uncertain<br>situations so it would be nice if our<br>students were better prepared than I was<br>when I became a house surgeon<br>um so with that in mind<br>um I really enjoy teaching trying to<br>prepare our students from my own<br>experience I found that ritual<br>humiliation was not an effective<br>teaching tool so I've I've put that to<br>one side now<br>um but I do like to tell students what<br>they need to learn and you know my<br>experience was that we had to learn<br>everything but you don't have to learn<br>everything you just have to learn what's<br>important and if you tell the students<br>what they should learn what's really<br>important then they'll learn it it's not<br>a secret and learning can be fun here<br>are some students that I didn't prepare<br>earlier they they look like they're<br>having fun they're smiling<br>and if they see patients real patients<br>and they can follow a patient Journey or<br>hear of a patient's experience they<br>often really learn around that because<br>they remember the patient and that<br>experience it's very powerful for them<br>so clinical teaching is is really<br>essential<br>we um we've combined a bit of teaching<br>and research so that's kind of the best<br>thing to do really if you can research<br>into teaching<br>um so we set up a a an online Blended<br>learning approach so we put a lot of<br>learning materials on Moodle and we've<br>streamed that across the three schools<br>so we have a<br>same curriculum that we teach in each<br>school with the same resources and<br>students really love this it helps to<br>improve their<br>knowledge around things that they can<br>bring that to our tutorials and to the<br>patients and we we published on this a<br>few years back now which was good<br>and um finally I guess<br>I've talked about undergraduates but I<br>should talk about my postgraduate<br>students so<br>um I've been extremely lucky to be a<br>co-supervisor for a number of PhD<br>students and to have a wonderful Mentor<br>who told me how to be a supervisor that<br>was Professor David Baxter who who I<br>really thank for helping to set me on<br>that path and I've had some great<br>students Leslie Ward who was my first<br>PhD she got an exceptional thesis<br>looking at yoga practice in chronic pain<br>for rheumatoid arthritis and then I've<br>got a long-standing collaboration with<br>the psychology department Rasheen<br>hegerty looked at psychological<br>flexibility in managing fatigue related<br>disability<br>Carrie falling who looked at<br>musculoskeletal chronic pain and<br>inflammatory bowel disease and Miranda<br>Bula who spent eight years part-time<br>looking at the base of thumb Osteo<br>writers here so I've learned a huge<br>amount of that I probably know more<br>about this joint than any other<br>rheumatologist in in New Zealand thanks<br>to uh Miranda and it's been a great sort<br>of helping with their Journeys and<br>learning so much from their journey<br>through research<br>and that sort of leads me to finishing<br>off really because research is the<br>backbone of medicine and if we don't do<br>research we're stuck in a rutch we can<br>never move forward and we might end up<br>making statements like this so this was<br>a Surgeon General William Stewart in<br>1968 who unfortunately said the time has<br>come to close the book on infectious<br>diseases we've basically wiped out<br>infection in the United States so even<br>in 1968 that was perhaps a bold<br>statement<br>but but this is me in my second Global<br>pandemic covid-19 when I was redirected<br>to doing general medicine for a short<br>time when we're in the first lockdown so<br>that was an interesting experience too<br>um so I'd like to to finish off by<br>thanking a few people I'd like to thank<br>particularly my two children Mo and Thea<br>and Theo is in the audience today who<br>helped me with some of the philosophy<br>um thank you Thea and of course my<br>colleagues in the Rheumatology<br>Department here Katie Jenks Sarah Jordan<br>and Joe Mitchell with John hyton in the<br>middle here and they say it takes a<br>village to raise a child well it<br>certainly takes a Rheumatology<br>Department to keep in line an errant<br>academic in their midst so so thank you<br>for that and I like to come full circle<br>so<br>um I'll finish with Jean-Paul Sartre<br>again<br>and a thought for you which is as a<br>medical student you start by knowing<br>nothing about anything and that's<br>certainly very true then as you become a<br>doctor you learn more and more about<br>less and less as you become a specialist<br>until you reach a professor and by that<br>time you know everything there is to<br>know about nothing<br>and this was shown by Jean-Paul Sartre<br>who obviously got to the end there and<br>wrote a whole book about nothingness<br>I'll leave you with that thought thank<br>you<br>my name is Rachel Taylor for those of<br>you who don't know me it's my very great<br>pleasure to say thank you to Simon for<br>an amazing half an hour or so whistle<br>stopped tour through his life from his<br>early Pony days through to a medical<br>student clinician researcher and teacher<br>I think he did I'm sure you'll agree<br>with me a fascinating summary with highs<br>and lows with humor and humility and a<br>whole variety of things like that<br>one of the wonderful things I think<br>about IPL Simon is that you get to know<br>a bit more about people that you often<br>didn't know beforehand and I think that<br>was really signified here by your use of<br>Shakespeare in your title and then in<br>the next breath we're talking about Joy<br>Division and Talking Heads and and so on<br>and I think it's a really lovely aspect<br>of the IPL<br>um I think it was fascinating to see<br>your career through them through the<br>medical system<br>um and in particular some of the things<br>like the experience of working on the<br>AIDS Ward which must have been amazing<br>I'm not sure how many people saw a um<br>recent series that was on TV one but<br>exactly like that called sin or<br>something like that and you really<br>brought home that situation<br>I really liked also how you mentioned<br>teaching because as you know I talked to<br>you about teaching a couple of weeks ago<br>and I was intrigued with because I sent<br>Simon a special you know well done<br>because he got some of the best reviews<br>I've ever seen and his teacher not in<br>his teaching in any teaching recently<br>with quite a few students who said what<br>an amazing guy what an amazing teacher<br>but I was particularly intrigued at the<br>um comment there about the secrets that<br>you don't keep it a secret because one<br>of the comments was oh my God this was<br>revolutionary he told us what we needed<br>to know<br>and so I think that summed it up<br>beautifully in terms of amazing research<br>an amazing teacher and obviously a very<br>interesting<br>eclectic range of interests in men so on<br>behalf of the University it's difficult<br>you've lost it and run out of hands here<br>Simon but well done</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
