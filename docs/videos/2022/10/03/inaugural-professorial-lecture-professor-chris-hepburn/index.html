to<br>introduce our speaker tonight Professor<br>Chris heurn to give his inaugural<br>professorial lecture here at the<br>University of otago as indicated by our<br>vice Chancellor Chris is one of our<br>newer<br>professors having received a<br>well-deserved promotion to the position<br>in February of this<br>year after completing an undergraduate<br>degree in botany and zoology at this<br>University Professor heurn completed a<br>PhD in the department of Botany under<br>the guidance of katriana herd and<br>graduated in<br>2003 after working in a variety of<br>research and teaching jobs including<br>pioneering cross-disciplinary work on<br>Coastal ocean acidification with<br>Professor herd he began a tupu payo<br>postdoctoral fellowship that supported<br>the aspirations of<br>kahaki customary fishery managers in<br>restoring their fisheries and customary<br>rights Chris joined our Marine Science<br>Department as a lecturer in 2011 was<br>promoted to senior lecturer in 2014<br>and then associate professor in<br>2017 before completing his progress up<br>the academic rankings to reach full<br>Professor earlier this<br>year this rapid rise which it truly is<br>is a measure of the impact of Professor<br>Hepburn's transformative teaching and<br>research Into Climate Change aquaculture<br>fisheries management all in partnership<br>with Coastal<br>communities the key to this work is<br>building capacity and applying fit for<br>for purpose research to empower decision<br>making uh decision makers to alter<br>public policy surrounding Marine<br>management and ecosystem<br>restoration Chris is a longtime member<br>of the East otago tyur committee and<br>co-leads the teaki mahaki a research<br>partnership program with Kahu de<br>developed to better meet Community<br>aspirations and support local action by<br>tataki Kaki customary fies<br>managers Chris has published more than<br>70 papers on macroalgal<br>ecophysiology climate change and<br>customary Fisheries he leads an active<br>and diverse lab group that is committed<br>to supporting our Coastal Community<br>leaders as well as training the next<br>generation of scientists to gather and<br>share the knowledge we need to Traverse<br>our uncertain<br>future an outstanding outcome from this<br>research has been the establish at the<br>University of otago of the national<br>Center of research Excellence Coastal<br>People Southern Skies which Chris<br>co-leads and I'm delighted to say has<br>recently joined us in the divisional<br>office research on its own will not get<br>you promoted at the University of otago<br>in addition to his transformative<br>research program Chris is a truly<br>excellent teacher at all levels and<br>across a range of programs including the<br>agriculture program as well as botany<br>and in Marine Science as coordinator of<br>aquaculture and Fisheries he has taken<br>this program from six students when he<br>joined the university in

received<br>divisional awards for community<br>engagement and MDI and Pacific<br>content that's enough for me tonight in<br>his own words we're going to hear about<br>Chris's Journey from a kelp ecop<br>physiologist he'll explain what that is<br>to where he is today please join me in<br>h<br>um hello everybody um and I'm going to<br>look out and see if I can if I know<br>anyone out there so I might might be<br>picking some people out I'd just really<br>like to thank um the vice Chancellor's<br>welcome and also um Pro Vice Chancellor<br>thank you Richard um it's it's been a<br>bit of a whirlwind and and I can't say I<br>remember a lot of those things and um<br>when it's all B out like that it seems<br>like we've been up to a few few<br>different things and being busy when<br>sometimes you know I don't necessarily<br>feel like I'm working particularly hard<br>um as you can see from this picture here<br>this is where we are now um I could<br>probably do with a a wee bit of exercise<br>this is the team at Pak cani Inlet and<br>um this was probably two weeks ago um<br>and and I don't know if many of you are<br>here um today I can't quite see I'm<br>getting old and can't quite that here<br>you going team<br>um yeah we pulled out I think about five<br>tons of an invasive seaweed called Ander<br>P from P Cano Inlet and um it's the<br>first time I think that I've kind of<br>felt instant gratification in science<br>and in this work because it's such a<br>long game you know this is the our<br>restoration of our Coastal<br>ecosystems is a generational<br>process um often we have to you know I'm<br>a scientist but we have to have faith<br>about our approaches and for for being<br>able to do something so instantaneous<br>and also transformative as we transition<br>from leadership in the water from the<br>University to<br>Kahu um you know and the work that we've<br>done to get to that space I'm really<br>proud of this picture and I'm proud of<br>what we did<br>um I can see Brendan now out there and<br>um I'm I'll talk about you guys later so<br>I'm not going to get onto that<br>um hopefully this thing will work um<br>here we go um so I give lectures I<br>generally give them I do first year and<br>I do um sort of practical stuff later on<br>this is how I start one of my lectures<br>um I quite like going giving a lecture<br>about I don't know Marine ecology and<br>then just hitting students with what I'm<br>who I<br>am and I give a talk this is one thing<br>it's about me it's about fighting the<br>man the importance of place friendship<br>which I think is Central in everything<br>and I have a real issue with the idea<br>that contracts and stuff have higher<br>value than friendship um wearing red<br>hats we Marine scientists right you got<br>to wear red hats um the future and also<br>where the student fits in it and<br>students being I guess<br>um confident enough to know even though<br>they might be first year science student<br>they've got something to offer they've<br>got something to offer their communities<br>um and science should be part of the<br>decision- making process and research<br>and you should offer yourself up and<br>service to your<br>communities but um a key thing for them<br>to learn for me is leadership sits<br>within our communities not with us you<br>know we're like I oh I'm going to try to<br>get through this um I don't know how<br>long I've got maybe two hours I think<br>I've heard um<br>but you know for me science is is like a<br>spade right it's a tool it's something<br>you use and there's other information<br>out there that you can use too and so<br>when we start having these discussions<br>about things like Mar H hunger and<br>Science and things like this for me I<br>don't quite get it because you you must<br>respect<br>information and when we're trying<br>struggling to actually fix some of the<br>issues we have I'll take any tool that's<br>in the kit please because come is what<br>I'm<br>after um so there's not going to be a<br>lot of uh what would you say words and<br>stuff like this in this because I was a<br>bit worried I was going to maybe make a<br>few spelling mistakes dad's an English<br>teacher so he would probably um be some<br>grammatical issues um I'm going to talk<br>about my family and the importance of<br>family I'm going to talk about place<br>maybe I'll talk a little bit about some<br>of the research we've done over the<br>years I'm going to talk about to putty<br>which has been Central I think in my<br>life and it's so great that in my job my<br>service component allows me to do that<br>for a job you know that's the most the<br>best<br>thing um for me but also there's other<br>things that come with that that might<br>not be so good and I'm going talk about<br>the future probably I I show this<br>picture here to my first year students<br>the first year not mine the first year<br>students and about the background and I<br>always like to show um Central in our<br>life's fishing I think um<br>and I've got here's my<br>great-grandfather um my grandfather and<br>and Blake and Emily's great-grandfather<br>Jack hiitburn um and he was a really<br>important part of our life he um flew<br>Spitfires for four years in combat in<br>World War II um but probably what when<br>you in best for was being a really good<br>fisherman and a hunter and really<br>serious about it and also probably I<br>don't know um I don't know what dad<br>thinks but maybe just seeding some of<br>that reading books and and doing things<br>like that that sort of allowed perhaps<br>mom and dad or dad to go to university<br>um for the first time even though<br>perhaps it wasn't the most respected<br>profession in Hammer Springs so<br>um that's some pictures uh i' just I<br>want to acknowledge right now um Chris<br>um I'll talk a little bit more about us<br>later but um she didn't want me to say<br>anything but the sacrifice that Chris<br>has made<br>to support me to get to this position<br>Chris worked at the University as a<br>technician for maybe 15 years would that<br>be right Chris I can't remember it was<br>15 long years as a technician and I can<br>see some technicians up here right now<br>and I want to acknowledge them and I<br>will acknowledge them some some more as<br>I go through this because you know my my<br>wife and partner is a technician and<br>without them we don't do nothing around<br>here I can tell you that right now we're<br>supposed to call them the professional<br>staff now or I don't know everyone's a<br>professional so um Blake Emily um I'm<br>sure I've been a great father and<br>haven't haven't let you down at<br>all but no um it's been awesome to um to<br>have you guys and um yeah thanks a lot<br>but I just acknowledge Chris her Central<br>work and her sacrifice of quitting her<br>job to support me for that Ascent<br>because it's not easy I can tell you<br>right now being in a with a couple<br>together both working coming home and<br>Chris worked in a pretty difficult<br>workplace and I had to hear about it<br>every night and and I um I started and I<br>was getting paid twice as much of much<br>of her in about half the time so it's<br>just that thing it's that inequality we<br>have um so I acknowledge techn I can see<br>Vicki and St out there and I'll talk a<br>bit more don't know if any of the<br>Skippers managed to get here today but<br>um I'll acknowledge them later so um<br>here's some blurry photographs that mom<br>um managed to get me thanks mom um his<br>dad looking really cool and Mom and<br>that's us and so that's us and ratonga<br>uh I was born in Nelson um and then we<br>headed across the ronga in about well I<br>don't know when I was probably about<br>four or five I think um it was a real I<br>think it was a really different thing to<br>do um I don't know how accepting the<br>families were of it but um it was super<br>important to us I know miles has also<br>lived in the Pacific Islands as as a<br>younger sort of person and um for us it<br>was really important um I<br>think and obviously three brother Three<br>Brothers um led by John uh our boss and<br>um there was us doing stuff in ratonga<br>generally not a lot of clothes worn um<br>there's myself and and El um Elisa was<br>saying to me that he stole that uniform<br>later on um after that that's pretty bad<br>and there's me um so went to arit here<br>Primary School in um in uh the Cook<br>Islands and apparently it's quite a<br>prominent primary school for like I can<br>see some fellow cook island people from<br>Moki uh representing there um Troy Mina<br>it's awesome to be able to cure and it's<br>awesome to be able to um just actually<br>know that some of that stuff stayed with<br>us I don't know John and El remember a<br>lot more of it than I do but for us it<br>was um yeah we wanted to come home for<br>the dog<br>and it was a bit of a mistake really we<br>dog timekeeping is not my strength so<br>remember someone throw something at me<br>if I I get lost<br>um here's um our other grandfather this<br>is um toong a Granddad that um Ivan<br>croshaw um and that's us in the in Cook<br>Islands trying to catch some Coda I<br>think that's John and I um and that us<br>at our Rock what do we call that was it<br>cowat rock rock or something like that<br>um down um down at the Lagoon where we<br>we would hang out and that's really<br>where our connection came to the Sea and<br>I'd just thanks Mom and Dad for taking<br>us there it was um really really<br>important um and then we ended up here<br>um which was a bit of a shock I think um<br>we turned up and I don't know when we<br>got there did we get there in March or<br>something I can't<br>remember February it was fairly warm and<br>we were barefooted and brown and we<br>kicked ass and SW<br>just dominated and um and yeah but then<br>we became crom willians I'd like to say<br>that I'm from raratonga and say that my<br>my mountain is you know um there but<br>unfortunately or fortunately Cromwell<br>became our<br>hometown and it's a great place to grow<br>up I was interviewed this morning by a<br>guy on Radio 1 Jamie green who was one<br>of dad's students he didn't think you<br>you'd remember him Dad but he had a good<br>experience in um in Cromwell so it's a<br>great it was a great school I thought I<br>thought Cromwell College was a really<br>good school and um there's been some<br>some fairly prominent thing so a little<br>thing happened when we were in in um<br>Cromwell um more or less the history was<br>wiped off the landscape and that's why<br>the town grew because they were building<br>the dam um and when I think this is<br>probably would it be when I was in<br>university I can't remember when it was<br>93 maybe or it was a bit earlier um and<br>you know things like<br>Chinatown along here was a really<br>important sort of archaeological thing I<br>don't know Richard whether you excavated<br>it but you're pretty young so I'm not<br>sure that that would have been you would<br>have looked at that but it just got<br>wiped off the face of the Earth really<br>um I was really excited because I<br>thought it'd be super good fishing CU<br>like har when they rose that and it was<br>real good fishing and but it never<br>really turned out to be quite everything<br>I hoped so this is where we used to be<br>as kids these are the tailings just<br>north of Cromwell they gone and that's<br>why call<br>Mata it's gone now but when I talk to<br>someone from the<br>W and E from there when they lost their<br>Villages their<br>udupa um what we experience is a very<br>small thing compared to that but there<br>was culture here that I've got some you<br>know different oldtimers there just<br>talking about how much they hate Rob<br>malun and wanted to kill him um you know<br>but at the same time I guess we need<br>power so that's why and I think that<br>impacted on me a<br>little um yeah so chomel College I went<br>and played a little bit of basketball in<br>Nelson college for a year because um I<br>got a scholarship and it was cheaper for<br>me to be there than be at home um and<br>you I went to seron Hall just like our<br>vice Chancellor it's the most uh<br>prominent um of all the halls of<br>residents um John my brother he was a<br>Trailblazer for me and I went where he<br>went and um followed him little brother<br>Al went to knock that's pretty lame<br>sorry Caroline Caroline now is um head<br>of KNX um so I acknowledge Caroline Your<br>Role there as the first female uh head<br>of of that college and and first person<br>in a leadership position there which is<br>why salon's much better um sorry um so<br>you can see me there<br>um that handsome looking devil in front<br>of me is my mate Alton Rick smallman and<br>um Alton and I like playing basketball<br>we've got our B basketball uniforms on<br>and um our coach was alage who's um who<br>couldn't come tonight but he um would<br>design all this stuff he'd make awards<br>for us and I have to say that my<br>undergraduate uh career was a right off<br>I sat at the third row here and a law<br>lecture I went to two probably went to a<br>tutorial then failed got this thing<br>called absence um mom said oh honey um<br>you're a good writer maybe you should do<br>law so that was that was a real mistake<br>and it was 9 three um they just put in<br>student loans so we were paying Market<br>rates so I'd go and work on the Cherry<br>orchards in summer and every say I<br>should be sharing sheep and yada yada<br>well we wen't getting a lot of favors um<br>and then you'd have stuff like you'd be<br>paying rent to someone who owned the<br>house and had a car and got a full<br>student allowance so it was a pretty<br>unfortunately dad was a school teacher<br>so he couldn't hide his salary so when<br>next time next career dead um try<br>something a bit different oh and and<br>then second year I was about to have a<br>flat on Castle Street no sorry um third<br>year third year I was about to go to<br>Castle Street right next to to the<br>guardis and Chris saved me seriously she<br>saved me I wouldn't have I would have<br>that have been it and I helped her with<br>how to study for exams and she told me<br>not to be an idiot and we we managed to<br>get we managed to get through and we<br>graduated about five years later um I<br>went to um<br>postgraduate studies I had a terrible<br>record it was improving um and then I<br>met a um a sucker called Katrina herd um<br>so Katrina she's hopefully out there<br>listening um she gave me a chance she<br>was the only academic I approached in<br>the whole time I Z as an as an undergrad<br>you know she was the only one I was<br>brave enough to go up to because she was<br>super nice and self-deprecating she she<br>didn't pretend like she knew everything<br>and when she taught you she'd teach you<br>one thing she wouldn't try to teach<br>30 that was something that really spoke<br>to me and I went to her and I I remember<br>Al and I we started learning to dive and<br>I found some Brens that were growing on<br>some C where are you Abby representing<br>Brens um found some of them and she's<br>like I did some work on this in British<br>Columbia and then she allowed me into<br>her lab and that was she gave me a<br>chance and um I just look at some of the<br>um dodgy customers I've given a chance<br>in the past Louis Bennett Jones you're<br>the worst of them<br>um um but you know I it's very hard to<br>judge um judge a student and it's always<br>good to take a punt on them Katrina did<br>and um it worked out I know I'm not sure<br>if it worked out for her but it<br>certainly worked out for me all right so<br>here's a classic picture um me and my<br>undies at well as rock I used to stand<br>in my undies there when tour buses would<br>go by it was just a thing I like to do<br>and you can see Stu there and Stu's just<br>up there hey stu um back in the day we<br>get in his in his Patrol um and drive<br>out there it was a nan Patrol was it or<br>Land Cruiser Land Cruiser that's right<br>in his Land Cruiser would drive out<br>there and he'd do stuff like Ronnie who<br>can't be here tonight um Ronnie Bell<br>who's a massive supporter of us um she'd<br>have a Mills and Boon book inside and<br>she used to throw them out the window as<br>we drove out out to the harbor so stw's<br>a pretty funny guy and um he did<br>everything for me he supervised my help<br>supervised my PhD he helped us find the<br>geology boat I think it was a geography<br>boat we found a boat um we swam this<br>huge distance the stew was probably<br>about 80 at that at that time and we<br>were swiming these long distances<br>together um with rulers and flagging<br>tape we had no idea what we were doing<br>because Katrina had only worked inter<br>tid right and Sh and I started working<br>on kelp um and we because Katrina worked<br>on kelp a little bit in British Columbia<br>the same species macrs pyer the giant<br>kelp but sh and I were sort of pioneers<br>we didn't know anything about what we<br>were doing but it was so much fun it was<br>the best thing I've ever did we chose<br>the site Harrington Point intigo Harbor<br>cuz CH said oh this HS of crayfish there<br>never saw<br>one so there's um J Stewart Mark Tilson<br>I found these photos in my draw stew um<br>so Mark's now up in fruitlands hanging<br>out working on an orchard he did a<br>masters at um at botney and um he's<br>probably listening in too so Mark gets<br>so seasick he'd have to take pills just<br>to go in the harbor and we tag C with<br>flagging tape and um it worked out<br>pretty well I can see sitting right next<br>to um St Vicky hey Vicki um and you're a<br>part of it too because botney I tell you<br>what it was the best department in the<br>universe I don't know if anyone else<br>from botney is here J yeah<br>yeah and Jim Jim F he's up there too<br>he's part of it hey Kath um bney back<br>then you know that was it was super a<br>really good place um and then St we as<br>we went on he' be he's so generous we'<br>use his boat we go to his house um we<br>annoy Ronnie come home drunk and eat<br>food and would go all over us and um he<br>supported us and we did so much really<br>really important research and he also<br>helped us transition into working with<br>nahu these are some pictures from when<br>we worked at CoCo up at um Port Levy and<br>did a series of um bits of work and<br>stews connections and just being down to<br>earth he worked at Hillside and he<br>worked with a guy called Kenny Niha way<br>back and they learned to dive together<br>and later on Kenny's daughter tier<br>connected me to Nati poau and east cape<br>so it was through those relationships<br>and those friendships and Stu's<br>generosity and also his intelligence and<br>sorry stu um and also he was a really<br>good Skipper a very safe Skipper so I<br>just acknowledge you Stuart um and I<br>know you helped a lot of other people<br>too so um and I know at the end it<br>wasn't that good because we started on<br>this transition away from practical out<br>there doing stuff doing stuff more on<br>computers and and I think that's<br>something we really need to think about<br>as a university how we maintain those<br>connections to our community to our<br>environment to our places and our<br>teaching and um obviously our research<br>too so thanks J<br>um so here's um a few Publications out<br>of my PhD I found out the kelp grew um<br>these these BR zones that lived on it um<br>produced nitrogen um particularly<br>hydroids which are smaller little fury<br>uh um sort of Carn micr carnivorous um<br>Colonial animals produce nitrogen and<br>when you um have low growth rates in the<br>summer if you have lots of these these<br>animals living on your surface you grow<br>more and we did a series of different<br>that right we'll move on we'll move on<br>fair enough um can I can I just have one<br>more um<br>we work down in um St Island um in about<br>2002 um sorry I know it was a bit boring<br>someone someone indicate me the time too<br>rather than just heckling<br>um so this work was around um some of<br>Katrina earlier we looking at Mass<br>transfer limitation so how um nutrients<br>move through the water and really what<br>we simply found is if you get waves you<br>get more growth because the nutrients<br>can get to the surface of the blade and<br>they can take their nutrients up more<br>quickly but if you get un unidirectional<br>flow due to um tital flow where's Millan<br>is he here yeah here you go Millan this<br>is a good paper for you um the thing sit<br>the whole canopy sits down and these<br>skimming flows occur and you can't get<br>the nutrients coming in so waves are<br>really key and productive and that's why<br>you might go and see you find big Power<br>when it's wave exposed Emily sit down<br>god um Lisa where are you Lisa I see you<br>back there um Lisa I did some work um on<br>P the invasive seaweed and we looked at<br>um it all around the LA of South isand<br>we just drove around AER and jumped in<br>the water and had some fun and and<br>published a paper on that and this work<br>came we we're still doing it today and a<br>lot of these foundations are actually<br>being applied now in what I do in quite<br>different<br>context um I was supposed to explain<br>what ecophysiology was everyone knows<br>what it is it's the dying out of um I'll<br>tell you a bit of a secret if any of you<br>would be<br>scientists stick between disciplines as<br>soon as you get trapped in a discipline<br>right ecof physiology when an ecologist<br>talking to you you say I'm a I'm a<br>physiologist when a physiologist is<br>talking to you you're an ecologist right<br>um so they can't pin you down and um<br>that's why we did it but it's also super<br>important right how organisms respond to<br>environmental stresses a super important<br>um thing around um climate change and<br>things like that so we made some<br>predictions and then Katrina<br>heard had a knew this guy called John<br>Raven and John Raven is those probably<br>my two science Heroes right I'll say so<br>John Raven's a sort of guy that would go<br>down to rakuda Stewart Island wearing a<br>skirt with a Pity coat and just<br>wandering the old guy with the beard he<br>was brilliant he's probably one of the<br>few Geniuses I've met um working and<br>John was talking about something called<br>ocean of certification Royal Society<br>wrote a um a paper on this in 2005 and<br>John was the lead author Katrina and<br>John were pretty close and we started<br>some of the early work on ocean<br>acidification on impacts and things like<br>that um unfortunately I was the postdoc<br>so um my experiments didn't work out<br>very well so when your experiments don't<br>work very well what you do is you tell<br>all the people what to do and how to do<br>it right so he wrote this this paper on<br>how to actually effectively determine<br>the impacts of ocean and certification<br>because there was some pretty rough work<br>early on um and this stuff hurts when we<br>start having debates on climate change<br>and impacts and things like that we need<br>to be super careful about what we do and<br>um so we were just the people that would<br>talk about this and I'll acknowledge<br>Keith Hunter and Kim Curry as well um<br>Keith's um student and Kim's not here<br>and obviously um Keith um we miss him<br>and um he was been very important for me<br>and I see am Marie out there as well and<br>amarie and I were supported um by Keith<br>and um it was good we met the chemist<br>halfway they're weirdos man chemists I<br>don't know if there's any chemists<br>around but um modu where are you yeah<br>but yeah yeah it's um you're you're<br>different to those sort of chemists um<br>yeah um yeah so that was just they<br>didn't understand things like<br>replication proper experimental design<br>and everything they thought was easy we<br>thought was hard and everything we<br>thought was easy they thought was hard<br>so it's pretty cool and Kim carry is a<br>legend of um of Marine Science and New<br>Zealand and the immunity transa and that<br>long-term pH Transit that we support at<br>the university is Iconic and the only<br>long-term um transic of but the boring<br>sign up again of um ocean ocean pH in<br>the southern hemisphere so um Christina<br>mcra came along I don't know if she's<br>turned up probably not um and helped us<br>with some getting some really crazy sort<br>of experimental setups do you remember<br>them guys Jo and Vicki do you remember<br>that eventually it rusted away um I<br>think and we did some pretty cool<br>experiments um we got this guy called<br>Chris Cornwall um who was who worked<br>pretty hard um he recently won the prime<br>minister's science award which is super<br>surprising to us but you know um don't<br>you reckon shu How did he do that he<br>tell you Chris worked hard um and other<br>people as well through time and um we<br>found that that ocean acidification does<br>negatively infect these Coraline algae<br>that are foundational in kelp forest and<br>I'll try and get through this stuff<br>because it's then we did some work Chris<br>cornall led by Katrina herd did stuff on<br>buffering so what can you do about ocean<br>acidification it's happening maybe if<br>you grew CP which takes up CO2 it<br>increases the pH perhaps that could be a<br>way of dealing with some of these issues<br>we have so we published a lot of<br>research my my one um that I got and I<br>probably got my job because of it I got<br>this paper in global CH change biology<br>um about how different different um<br>functional traits and how C we use<br>carbon and how you can predict how the<br>um ecosystem is going to is going to<br>move in the future so that was really<br>important um yeah we nearly didn't send<br>it out um it was a lot of debate we<br>didn't think it was any good and it got<br>published in a pretty good journey<br>Global change Global change biology is a<br>very good Journal but we were sort of<br>here you know on the upswing so we just<br>got in there just before it you know<br>what I know you know what I mean miles<br>it's almost impossible now um but all<br>this work really started pushing me into<br>a central place we got pushed into a<br>place butterfly Bay tiwa Mahi in in the<br>East tago tyy because there were too<br>many waves out further and we ended up<br>just working in the bay here Stu and I<br>started working on that Coast I don't<br>know St would have been 2000 or when we<br>started doing some Bag experiments with<br>kelp and we had no idea about tyi or any<br>of that sort of stuff um but we started<br>working more and more in in this place<br>Hiwa Peninsula and it's become Central<br>now to our research and also in a way<br>Central to the our Center of research<br>Excellence as well um place again um<br>here's some pictures of all the<br>different people um I have to say uh<br>Katrina in the middle she always looks<br>pretty wind swept um looks B like slash<br>out of Guns and Roses um there um and a<br>bunch of other different people um this<br>is early on and they all were really<br>important um and and and had a real role<br>in what we're doing Derek that P picture<br>of Derek there's particularly I'm<br>particularly fond of that one and<br>there's a very young prie um yeah but<br>this um I'm going to have to acknowledge<br>one person and Chris was saying to me oh<br>you're so mean to prie So Daniel<br>Pritchard um take take a b um he came he<br>was my first summer student and I told<br>him to smoke cigars and and do very<br>little but he um he he's a brilliant<br>scientist and he's someone who supported<br>all of us very much with his mind he's a<br>super analytical he always wants to know<br>how things work and I'm not like that I<br>have no requirement to know how things<br>work prie work it out very quickly so he<br>did his he did his PhD at botney with<br>Katrina and myself um wait don't not<br>getting on to Tim yet get out there Tim<br>um he did um PhD there then he went<br>across and did um hydr modeling at<br>Queens University uh School of<br>Engineering and then he came back and<br>worked for nahu first scientist that<br>sort of crossed over and he did some<br>amazing things like he'd go he went and<br>fought uh for Littleton Port dding so<br>for example um he turned up um in his<br>eggshell suit that a wedding suit and it<br>was him versus seven other lawyer types<br>Engineers you know these people you go<br>to who's ever been to a BL um<br>environment court hearing when people<br>are so sure Jim knows they so sure about<br>it oh I'm certain that's going to happen<br>and you know they have no idea but<br>they'll go on in a court and they'll say<br>I'm certain it's going to happen and so<br>prie um stood up there and fought on<br>behalf of natif fi and fakar opo which<br>is Littleton Harbor um and fought for<br>their that's the only place they have<br>and he fought for them um and eago we<br>fought um the port dredging company here<br>um and that helped in that process and<br>as soon as prie finished he got out and<br>went to get into the into the taxi and<br>his whole ass ripped out of his suit so<br>fortunately that didn't happen in front<br>of the<br>judge but um thanks prie and I know that<br>that you're a great teacher you're a<br>great supervisor you're a great<br>researcher and you're and you're great<br>at Service as well you're the um the<br>best academic I've ever seen that's not<br>really an academic but I guess you are<br>now so welcome<br>um yeah so this all moves on this is our<br>current sort of work again on Polaris we<br>have a a really good time out there we<br>but we work pretty hard there's Tim are<br>you up there Tim hey Timmy<br>um father and son he we're we're we're a<br>dive team that's what Tim and I call<br>ourselves um and this is in<br>forland so this work continues today and<br>with different people um there's Wendy<br>Professor Wendy Nelson who's been<br>important in my career as well and next<br>to them is Bill Dixon who's a skip of<br>the of the Polaris who who is um someone<br>I would like to acknowledge um as<br>well while we're at it let's just<br>acknowledge a few let's call them<br>support staff um you can see in the<br>background there um he's no longer with<br>us but I'd like to acknowledge Dave<br>Wilson's work um Through The Years um<br>and what he did uh for helping us do<br>some really important research he built<br>the caram Moorings the moing that we<br>looked at Coastal pH much of the work<br>that we've published over the years and<br>I know miles certainly as well with the<br>heat blocks and all those different<br>different things that Dave put together<br>um you know that that technical that<br>technical work that goes into<br>Publications is super important um this<br>handsome looking devil from mon um n<br>Pearson we'll talk a bit about him in a<br>minute but I'll just thanks Dave even<br>though you're not here you probably<br>don't like me but whatever um another<br>Skipper who's not here anymore um Steve<br>King who's from down on St Island um he<br>supported us when we did a um a scol up<br>survey down there and really opened up<br>the community for us and and did a a<br>super good job so without him that<br>survey wouldn't have been been as good I<br>see see wheels up there somewhere it was<br>a pretty good pretty good times I<br>remember remember that um and you know<br>we dive in a lot of different situations<br>it's pretty full on there's lots of<br>different divers going around it's easy<br>to have accidents um health and safety<br>is a really really important thing and<br>um n Pearson um look at that handsome<br>devil I'd have to say that you're Poss<br>possibly the person that makes my job<br>the easiest of anyone in the University<br>so I acknowledge that and I acknowledge<br>the support you give me because I'm a<br>I'm a scientist I'm not a diving<br>technician you know that right you know<br>what I am and you support me to be safe<br>and you support all of us all of those<br>guys sitting around Nile right there he<br>keeps them safe and um and that's I<br>acknowledge that he does a wonderful job<br>is it supposed to be about me or other<br>people probably so we get down there and<br>um do some different work we've got got<br>a new Skipper coming in Mark Elder who's<br>great just it kind of reminds me a bit<br>when Stu and I started working just an<br>Enthusiast and he's working with with uh<br>one of our students Lucy and they just<br>just loving the work right and just<br>starting out different and there's Bill<br>there just quietly looking after all of<br>us when we're in a really remote place<br>miles from anywhere if anything goes<br>wrong you know Bill's the guy Bill's the<br>guy that stitches my head up when I head<br>it on things right he's the guy that<br>comes and be as tough as you like but as<br>soon as you hurt yourself he's super<br>he's just awesome so um B you're not<br>there it's not surprising<br>um I acknowledge all of Bill's work and<br>just the complexity of what he does and<br>the fact that what he does what we do<br>sits on his shoulders as a Skipper and<br>um he's done it for many years and I<br>remember Stu and I going and seeing him<br>and you know I don't know if he was well<br>looked after back in the day and um<br>St had a really good boss maryan Miller<br>and<br>um just having different bosses and the<br>different support you get in different<br>departments so good on your good on your<br>bill thank you and just see this isn't<br>the sne island This Is Us diving sne<br>Islands bills Manning the Jolly boat he<br>pulls all your dive gear out he's an old<br>fell but he's stronger than me and he'll<br>be on the boat in that cold all day<br>pulling our dive gear and when it's<br>snowing and and not complain always be<br>positive and and and work really hard<br>all right so has they got any time on<br>them what do you reckon how long have<br>been going for I can't read those sort<br>analog and when did I<br>got whatever um so this is part two of<br>of what I'm going to talk what I'm going<br>to talk about<br>um so there's two key people I'd like to<br>here one is is Henrik Muller who was a<br>professor of zoology and involved with<br>Seas safe and um for me Henrik um he<br>liked uh he liked people that he thought<br>were sort of injured puppies or<br>something like that to come and help<br>them I had a choice of either working<br>with nahu or going to the orne islands<br>and working on kelp and both of them<br>frighten the hell out of me and luckily<br>I went with working with naho because I<br>didn't know who who naho was I've come<br>from Cromwell you know we knew that the<br>tany was<br>we knew all these different things we<br>had really good<br>mty some really good Marty teachers but<br>my tahoo was I don't know Dad's looking<br>at me like he probably knew but um it's<br>um it was something I didn't I just skim<br>through because it was school I don't I<br>wasn't interested so Henrik showed me<br>that um he provided the opportunity<br>through what he wrote um tiny mea um<br>who's a um an expert on um poha Kel bags<br>was my cultural Mentor um when I started<br>my post stock and I just probably the<br>biggest hero I<br>think in conservation in the south<br>Scott exactly B so um if you look at the<br>number of MTI Tha and T Custom<br>protection areas that have been<br>established in the South Island that's<br>down to Nigel support of Tang tiaki if<br>if someone had established that many<br>Marine reserves it would be sir Nigel<br>Scott he's probably listening to me<br>going oh God now I've got to Target my<br>back um but nigela supported us since<br>day one and just in the background<br>quietly working away and I know um prie<br>um just thinks the world of Nigel and<br>sometimes it upsets me because I'm here<br>too you<br>know so n you couldn't come but um good<br>on your man he's out there doing the<br>work so tiny Meo who I mentioned a<br>really important um person and probably<br>one of my greatest achievements I think<br>was when I heard that tiny had agreed to<br>a change in the boundary of a marai a<br>customary fishery protection area that<br>he had been fighting for for many years<br>because I said it was okay apparently<br>not sure if I did say it but he said if<br>Chris thinks it's all right then I think<br>it's all right and for me tiny saying<br>that was really really important for me<br>um someone who I see um in that that<br>high table of of um understanding about<br>um marine ecosystems and obvious<br>obviously there's Waka too let's not get<br>on to<br>that we get am up<br>here um I really love this photo um this<br>is Brendan at his best um a lot going on<br>behind him is Greg ker um and Viv um who<br>just doing some work on their River so<br>Greg is um from uh K her uper he's done<br>a lot of work um in with met Lagoon<br>trust and he works at the University in<br>the glass blowing unit so he's helped us<br>both out there as a member of K Hood<br>upper and also as a really key person in<br>some of our research our MB Endeavor<br>smart ideas around kelp forest<br>restoration the team at the glass<br>blowing Unit were really key and<br>developing some of the gear that we used<br>to be successful in that um so I<br>acknowledge Greg and um he was a member<br>of the tyri um and just a great man<br>founding member of the verain so I just<br>couldn't resist saying that he hates<br>when I say that um and yeah but Brendan<br>is who we're going to who who we'll talk<br>about a little bit um I met Brendan when<br>he was mowing the lawn at<br>hwa um and I said hey how's it going you<br>Brendan slack or something like that I<br>thought that's what his name was and um<br>that didn't go down very well there's a<br>rugby player called slacke that that<br>Australian Coler and meeting Brendan I<br>think was probably the key thing the key<br>thing that happened in my career and um<br>just the learning that I've had from<br>Brendan I rang Brendan before this and<br>said Brendan what should I say um it's<br>not Brendan's not like a guru and you<br>think he's just sorry Brendan but he's<br>just someone who's just been there for<br>us all the time and and just<br>gently move the Waker in the right<br>direction he's um Tang tiaki um for k um<br>from K hickey hickey um I think that's<br>that brins or is that you Susie where<br>are you from<br>Brenan around there around there yeah<br>they could be distantly related<br>um<br>um yeah so don't worry Chris and I are<br>related too um it's a it's a South<br>Island thing<br>um yeah but Brenan is the chair of EAS<br>tago to PR and he's taking us into<br>battle many a time and mahanga Kai is<br>the thing that that brings us together<br>um as people will probably have guessed<br>I'm not the best when it comes to ter<br>Mari I'm not the best when it comes to<br>you know<br>I'm not a bad actor but that sort of<br>stuff the songs and those things don't<br>speak to me mangai speaks to me it gets<br>me right here right because my family<br>that's what they did it's different but<br>it was always a very serious thing for<br>our family it wasn't like you go and<br>have some drinks and do it go and go<br>fishing or you go hunting and you do it<br>and this here is Central to the<br>settlement for nahu the places and<br>practices associated with traditional<br>food and natural resources I'm down with<br>that and I'm down with nahu and I<br>support them<br>and all the work that they're doing to<br>protect our systems for<br>everybody um so for us um tangai was<br>created by Henrik Muller with Nigel<br>Scott and we sort of changed a little<br>bit away from trying to find traditional<br>knowledge and and align it with science<br>and stuff we just went to more of a<br>we're going to provide you evidence so<br>you can actually make a difference why<br>we doing that it's not because we're<br>nice it's because we know you've got the<br>power to make a difference and that's<br>why over there and also it's a lot more<br>fun than working with the Department of<br>Conservation sorry Jim um it just is<br>isn't it Jim I can't say<br>anything um Easter Tiger toy I won't go<br>into too much you can read this paper<br>and um it's fascinating there's a whole<br>lot of different different stories in<br>there it's just the challenges of when<br>you you know everyone always goes on<br>they like these little catchphrases caai<br>it sounds real good mountain to the Sea<br>awesome how do you actually do it that's<br>super challenging Community lead<br>management how do you actually do<br>it it's cheap is it cheaper no it's not<br>it's more expensive it's cheaper if you<br>don't pay people but that's not<br>sustainable so some of the things<br>learnings we're doing in the tarri are<br>are just quite simple things but it's<br>all happening north of here we have open<br>cast gold mines we have surge ponds<br>being covered with sea level rows we<br>have dredge spoil from our local um orc<br>owned Port company who apply to<br>H so that's that's where we were in 2009<br>or 2010 it was so long ago um and that's<br>the thing it's these these things I talk<br>about friendship versus contracts and<br>things like that there there's some<br>dodginess that goes on I'm not saying<br>it's thec but there's some dodginess<br>that goes on when it's perfectly above<br>board it seems you've also got<br>challenges around things like you get<br>people like this trying to put a Marine<br>reserve in the middle of your customary<br>fishery that's been fought for from a<br>settlement um so I'm there um and so<br>that's another challenge we think of<br>marine conservation Marine reserves um<br>there's another side to it too we know<br>that if we put a Marine reserve in the<br>department of conservation isn't<br>probably going to fund people to look<br>after it well<br>enough so what difference does a Marine<br>reserve make if there's a whole bunch of<br>sediment pumping out of the<br>coast we have invasive<br>and all my work before um from botney<br>and from um before that it all fitted<br>really well because kelp forest are<br>Central on our Coast the key species are<br>reliant on them and the threats that we<br>have um are are directed at kelp forests<br>and obviously the human values that sit<br>there and some of those things I was<br>talking about another thing one thing<br>that Brenan said to me stuck really<br>stuck with me brennam was was born in in<br>matuda Mata matara<br>um it's mat UDA I think um he told me<br>that when he grew up they didn't have<br>Theo they didn't have the M but they had<br>the mahak kai and that was the<br>connection back and that for me that for<br>me tells it all and that's you know when<br>John and I are up there hunting and<br>we're up above W nakaru and we look at<br>just the mess that we've made over the<br>last 150 years collectively I'm not<br>going to say it was just us I'll blame<br>you probably Dead doing those oil<br>um that was in the 80s<br>um so um Power was a key thing um I'll<br>try and wind this up a bit I think I'm<br>running out of time Richard I'm looking<br>at you good is everyone<br>happy yeah yeah yeah everyone's happy<br>good yeah I don't care Blake um so power<br>we started working on this and I'm not<br>really a power expert I actually find<br>them quite difficult they sulk and die<br>and they're invertebrates they're not<br>kelp um but we had to work on power<br>because that was the issue and I<br>remember going to a meeting and and<br>David Allison oku for um C her uper<br>grabed me by the leg and goes ah we only<br>waiting only Fisheries that's what we<br>want and I want to go I want this guy to<br>fish for me and I i' always remember<br>that and that's we designed our surveys<br>based on that because a customary<br>fishery it's not important what's deeper<br>that's where you listen you listen right<br>you listen to that's M to you listen and<br>you let it direct you rather than you<br>coming in with a strong idea I've got<br>this funding I need to do this I'm gonna<br>do this let's get out of my way it's<br>just not going to work you know it's<br>people have done things in the past and<br>you've got to say sorry and it's so hard<br>and I'm always helping people say sorry<br>and I take responsibility for that in<br>the TIY but if they just things the<br>right way they get so much more out of<br>it<br>so we've done a bunch of things with<br>power in theago tyi and I see this as a<br>list of failure we have other closures I<br>think the clo um reducing bag limits on<br>fish protecting kelp forest species from<br>cutting were really really important but<br>when we see we had to close the power<br>fishery which is a real a real<br>disappointment for us because when you<br>close a fishery you disconnect people<br>from cultural practice from connections<br>you know I remember dad telling me a<br>story about in Kota that no one used the<br>power<br>there they were just everywhere in the<br>inter total and then all of a sudden<br>Powers everyone it's your right it's<br>your right to have it well I'd rather<br>have fish in the water than a right um<br>so unfortunately we had to close things<br>and if we hadn't have done anything<br>about it we would have been stoked a<br>Brendan it' be like success Fisheries<br>closed it's all good but unfortunately<br>being scientists we went and monitored<br>it do um so we had all all the rules<br>were there we closed the<br>fishery but um we sort of getting out it<br>um but you can see a picture here<br>um where we can see um this is a closed<br>area 2009 to<br>2021 you can see an increase in power<br>and you can see a<br>decrease um outside this so this is<br>where we've reduced the bag limits to<br>two per person and this is another<br>closure at hwa where it hasn't really<br>changed so you can change things um and<br>think you've done a good job but<br>actually there's something else going on<br>um so one thing here is another thing I<br>just want to think about too and here's<br>a great I like take having pictures of<br>prit where he looks awful and and grumpy<br>because he often is um all the science<br>sounds great gives you a job makes you<br>feel like a big man but is it right now<br>that sounds pretty silly he what is this<br>guy talking about because<br>tyri uh redress for a for grievances<br>under the settlement we don't need<br>science for tongue tiak make decisions<br>they should be able to make decisions<br>but we know we live in a political world<br>so science is required to do it um an<br>Marie um your uh PhD thesis is still<br>still used um so for tyri um the the<br>idea is to give ranga local control over<br>that resource um but unfortunately<br>historical Fisheries legislation which<br>was slanted towards keeping Marty out of<br>the fishing industry right from the very<br>first regulation around oysters um so<br>slanted that it just doesn't really work<br>but if you actually Flex it and do a<br>whole lot of work you can get rang of<br>Tonga and Brendan and the tpr committee<br>with I didn't realize it was happening<br>by closing the fishery actually regained<br>rang Tonga over that one species because<br>they control the fishery now rightly so<br>rightly<br>so um and probably one of the my you<br>know the best things that I've seen was<br>when Brendan talked to a select<br>committee at at Parliament about<br>changing the rules around these<br>Fisheries speeding up um closures and<br>things like that um so quite often we<br>have to wait for two or three years<br>before our rules come through while we<br>watch The Fishery go down the toilet so<br>I've sat there and watched Brendan out<br>of his office in karatani St down Big<br>Oil he used he did that once um St down<br>um big uh<br>Agriculture and um and also speak<br>Parliament and stuff like that and the<br>great thing about us and um I'll talk<br>about guy in a minute but um some of the<br>work all of us have done I can see all<br>of you have had a part of it<br>particularly students um is provide that<br>ammunition to allow Brendan to actually<br>say what I'm saying isn't a big lad of<br>rubbish we know what we're doing and we<br>can get the community alongside and<br>doing um and here's something that I<br>just um you guys can read a so maybe<br>I'll just have a quick rest while you<br>read<br>um this is from Susie Flack who's<br>sitting right next to Brendan there um<br>hey Susie um Susie Susie is um a great<br>supporter of all of us and she's real<br>staunch and always says she's always way<br>out there in the bloom left and green<br>sort of stuff and I can't have B wh and<br>stuff it's kind of annoying but um this<br>is what it's about right here and when<br>when Susie goes to S three Waters<br>hearing and is told that her voice isn't<br>relevant because she's got brown skin<br>that shows how far we've got to go in<br>this country you know Susie by herself<br>with a bunch of farmers and stuff I know<br>I'm hey um that's you know and Susie I<br>acknowledge your bravery there and that<br>really annoyed me and so um and that's<br>from someone from Central tago who cath<br>will probably might be a guess who it<br>might have been had some wranglings with<br>Alan Mark many years ago um that stuff<br>let's hope it dies and Susie I support<br>you and and this is what it's about<br>right this is what it's about so good on<br>you um so science as well you know um I<br>was talking about Louise um she hates<br>being um doing uh talks and things like<br>that um this is why science is good to<br>I'm saying why why are we doing science<br>also we can actually add value um we can<br>help you know the way we had some<br>proposals MPI thought oh that that won't<br>work but Louise is from Jersey where<br>they actually have the very same rules<br>they use the moon to Define when they<br>take fish can't do that just CU it's<br>just because we're not used to it it's<br>like when dad went to Kota no one died<br>for power now everyone does so that's<br>um I be finishing now Richard yeah yeah<br>all right so can I have five minutes<br>yeah um key key things to is also<br>teaching so we have the opportunity<br>through some of these courses that are<br>run nor Modi um that amarie's been part<br>of and preaching and everyone really all<br>the students get out there and Brennan<br>supports hugely Kyler Russell who's been<br>big in helping this and helping me um<br>and it gives students an opportunity<br>where it matters it matters in very<br>funny ways so um one of miles's students<br>Celia Richardson do you remember Celia<br>yeah um I think was working at the<br>Ministry of Education when this marer<br>and science debate occurred she sent me<br>an email saying how this course was so<br>important for her to actually be able to<br>engage in that debate because she<br>understood a little bit about those<br>things it's not about Fisheries or<br>anything like that it's about<br>understanding that and the only way you<br>can get that no mod being there for some<br>time getting comfortable talking to<br>people taking time not a box scking<br>exercise we need to demonstrate to our<br>students the right way to act um not<br>that it's something we just go and do<br>because we have to do it there's value<br>in it and this course is amazing I think<br>because I run it it's right from the<br>start we have observations questions<br>hypotheses research design Gathering<br>data lots of data analysis um Richard um<br>we do a lot of statistical stuff um we<br>put the data in context we report we<br>share it with the community it's just<br>like we do for a job there's Antoine out<br>there doing the hard yards at mui and<br>there's poor old prie looking real<br>grumpy because I'd been on the radio to<br>him saying data coming in hot data<br>coming in hot and then I came in with a<br>wet slate and threw it at him and um I<br>thought it was pretty funny but this is<br>this is really important you got to get<br>the data into your computer guys and um<br>back it up and all that sort of stuff do<br>it straight<br>away and then we report and we report in<br>a way that's actually going to lead to<br>action we have the research evenings<br>there's am Marie and I and um they<br>probably been going for about 10 years<br>with a bunch of beautiful students<br>um and guia there too um it's just you<br>know every every year we just share<br>short talks with the community and it's<br>so good for students because they feel<br>like they've done something you know<br>what I mean they're getting feedback the<br>Stu the community just love everything<br>they do even if it's super boring like<br>some of BL Thompson's work they're still<br>um they're still into it a<br>BL BL um and we're part of of the of the<br>rebuild of that ecosystem Brendan says<br>30 years down7 AG go so we're part of<br>that and it's a long long time that<br>we're looking at so you know we've got<br>to have some Faith let's not worry about<br>that it's another paper future um<br>there's some dodgy people in aaka um<br>Jackson Faro with some others and um<br>Coastal People Southern Skies we're<br>really looking forward to the vision of<br>that was what Susie was talking about<br>the the flourishing Wellness the Modi<br>order bringing back the abundance in our<br>Coastal ecosystems and then taking from<br>that abundance rather than fishing down<br>and that's consistent with some of the<br>leading fishery scientists in the world<br>Daniel paulley came here and talked<br>exactly the same thing in a different<br>manner so gu um gu n Lingham where are<br>you there you go stand up gu she won't<br>um you wouldn't even know if she did<br>stand up hey gu um I can CU I'm very<br>tall um guy and I are kind of Kindred<br>Spirits because we're very distinctive<br>and um it's kind of hard to hide um have<br>a look at this if you want to gu says it<br>so beautifully in this piece about why<br>closing a fishery is such a big deal and<br>um I I'll acknowledge um there's a bunch<br>of different people but gu your um your<br>work and and efforts and saving my ass<br>of many different I'm so pleased that<br>you've got an academic position and<br>Marine Science has got I think BR<br>sitting next year Wills here somewhere<br>we're in a good State aren't we miles<br>it's going to be it's a good future that<br>we have um no let's not worry about this<br>we do some stuff on kelp forest receding<br>methane medication there's a someone<br>from um aculture New Zealand the<br>magazine that probably wanted me to talk<br>more about this I don't know if Mark's<br>here um somewhere but um we won't talk<br>about that so I want these experiences<br>that our students and staff have hard<br>work<br>um you know like good times to<br>transition allow nah to be more involved<br>in this and that's what we're doing now<br>this is the transform of bit I think um<br>we're looking for leadership on the<br>water to transition from our capable<br>Skippers and support nahu in developing<br>the same research um out um capability<br>and ability to work on the water as we<br>have um and that's why this work in the<br>andara that we're doing on and this<br>transition is so important to me and so<br>positive it's probably the best thing<br>I've done I think in 10 years um I don't<br>know Brendon what you think I think it's<br>um a really important thing and we're<br>going to keep working really hard to<br>make sure that it works out so that's we<br>we're back to where we were um right at<br>the start and I'll just say<br>that I to to tie now I feel I I came<br>from<br>ratonga um in the Pacific and now I feel<br>like this coastline is mine um is part<br>of me not mine but part my place you<br>know that I work with I know it's Tong o<br>I know it's I know whose it is um can<br>just hear hangi in my in my ear right<br>now it's ours um and also a place for<br>for for my kids and and nephews and<br>nieces and brothers and and and all that<br>sort of stuff where we can contribute<br>and um and not and not do it from a<br>place of obligation or a place of<br>feeling bad about what we've done it's a<br>positive thing it's a real positive<br>thing and I think we you should take<br>take that from me um I'm still doing all<br>that cool stuff with kelp<br>but what fulfills me and my job is<br>supporting um Tong tiaki supporting um<br>people in re restoring fisheries and<br>also restoring those connections so we<br>can talk about these things so that's<br>all for me I don't know maybe I went way<br>over I'm really sorry if I did um but I<br>just<br>thank for e t py committee um I thank um<br>all of them and all the work that<br>they've done um and generally T tiaki I<br>and I really thank students of the<br>University who for me are so hard<br>working so positive the best things<br>about this<br>place by Miles students are right and um<br>I'm sure you guys all agree um that's<br>why we're here so thank you to the<br>students for all your work that you do<br>um and keep going keep learning realize<br>that there are jobs out there in seaweed<br>many jobs it's crazy seaweed is just<br>going gang bus ERS so um yeah and I just<br>I can see the core team there and um<br>Coastal people s s and and really<br>excited about the next what is six years<br>it seems to be flying by but yeah and<br>also um being involved in the Pacific<br>again with f f law and rose rose<br>Richard's team and being involved and<br>talking to articulate people rather than<br>us you know seaweed scientists we're<br>just grunting when you're go to have<br>some conversations with Rose's team wow<br>yeah so um thank you um thanks family uh<br>I think I'm done miles do you want to<br>come up and give me give me my<br>chainsaw to sit down<br>I have prepared some notes just to be<br>sure that anybody um I'm Koto and and<br>thanks very much because that was a<br>fantastic talking it's pretty pretty<br>hard act to follow going on from that um<br>it is a real pleasure for me to to close<br>the formal um part of the the evening by<br>thanking Chris as the head of the<br>department for um for um a fantastic<br>talk and and a real overview of your<br>your personal journey and your journey<br>through science and and the amazing work<br>you've been doing with the community<br>that's really come through um obviously<br>to to everyone and it's really been<br>obvious to us for the past 20 years that<br>you've been with us um as Chris has<br>highlighted he's he's a scientist and an<br>academic who who not only shows<br>excellence in his um science discipline<br>and he's a real leader in in the work on<br>seaweed and um that's know at the<br>national and international level but<br>he's also someone who has taken those<br>skills and that knowledge and he's tried<br>to apply it to benefit communities and I<br>think that's something we all aspire to<br>and acknowledge so in terms of his<br>research Chris didn't really talk much<br>about it as pure research but I mean I<br>do want to remind him that the OA work<br>that he did way back in the early 2000s<br>that was actually really leading and<br>Chris Chris's work on OA and the effects<br>of a certification on algae was well<br>ahead of it time with with Katrina and<br>and the late Keith Hunter what have and<br>um people have followed on from that I<br>mean that was that was really quite<br>leading work and Chris didn't really<br>emphasize that probably enough he's too<br>modest um we Al we also seen that Chris<br>has really dedicated a lot of his<br>professional and even his his private<br>energy to partnering with ew and Coastal<br>communities and um and and the<br>restoration of of coastal ecosystems and<br>sustainable management of those those<br>environments and that is you know that's<br>something that's on the top of of all<br>our should be on the top of all of our<br>minds as bring scientists and what have<br>and also partnering with community in<br>terms of identifying economic<br>opportunities that benefit not only<br>people but also the environment and the<br>the under area work is a really good<br>example of that the work you've been<br>doing with with local communities around<br>that and that's going to benefit as I<br>said people and and in the environments<br>that's<br>great I think has really shown us all<br>he's led by example how essential and<br>empowering it is that we incorporate<br>mang Mali and and CH Mali into our<br>principles um which guide our our<br>research um what we're trying to achieve<br>our approach to it and you know what are<br>we trying to get out of it and I think<br>Chris has been an Exemplar on that that<br>whole um<br>process and and I I think it's really<br>important to acknowledge how Chris has<br>sustained this I mean Chris has been<br>doing this for<br>couple of decades now at least yeah I<br>mean and that's that's a sustained<br>partnership with with ewe with local<br>Legion such as Brendan Flack um who's in<br>the room here and it's really it's an<br>inspiration I think it's also super<br>important for Chris it means a lot to<br>Chris I me it's as I said it's it's it's<br>the top of his list of priorities it's<br>all about friendship as opposed to<br>contract is y<br>um and I think lastly and I think it's<br>really evident and it's it's the energy<br>and the dedication that Chris has shown<br>towards mentoring his students and and<br>postto and we've got a whole room full<br>of them here they're all fantastic bunch<br>of enthusiastic guys that just have have<br>picked it up of Chris and I was going to<br>say you don't know how lucky you are but<br>I think you do realize how lucky you are<br>to have had Chris um mentoring you and<br>and being a real leader and and allowing<br>you to develop as young scientists and<br>and<br>and moving down to the real world and<br>and Chris has got um he's got students<br>that are all all dotted all through the<br>community and and around the country<br>doing fantastic work and I think that's<br>going to be a real Legacy of of your<br>career going<br>forward you spent the whole evening<br>acknowledging everyone else but I think<br>it's important that we actually<br>acknowledge you the contribution you<br>make to Marine Science and to the<br>universi is fantastic so um thank you on<br>on behalf of of my department in the<br>University um we are really lucky to<br>have you and our team as well I'm k um<br>ringer ringer the world is the World is<br>Yours Chris to to make a difference what<br>you're doing um I guess that that really<br>does wind up formal proceedings I just<br>want to thank everyone in the in the<br>audience for coming along this evening<br>um I've had a fantastic time listening<br>to Chris's journey and um I guess the<br>last thing is just to invite you over to<br>the staff club for refreshments and and<br>and<br>oh yeah and of course yeah and and this<br>is just a small token of the<br>University's appreciation for for all<br>your your amazing um contribution to the<br>to the university and and the community</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
