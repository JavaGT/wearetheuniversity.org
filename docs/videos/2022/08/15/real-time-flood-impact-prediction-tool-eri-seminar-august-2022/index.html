Flood forecasting has been developed for decades. However, the use of artificial intelligence is not reported in practice due to the lack of best practices and too wide uncertainty bounds. How can artificial intelligence really improve prediction? How can we constrain our data-driven modelling to reduce uncertainty?<br><br>Nevertheless, modelling is not enough. How can we use our prediction tool in an operational environment during a flood response? The TAIAO team has developed a new datamesh-based solution to face the multi-source of data issue. This presentation presents a new data-driven modelling framework for a real-time flood impact prediction application.<br><br>Phil Mourot has been working in Natural Hazards for more than 20 years, across different disciplines such as geoscience, computer science, electronics, geophysics and seismology, and completed a PhD in applied seismology in France to predict rockfalls and landslides (Grenoble). Phil is involved in the TAIAO project. With a foot in local government and another foot in research, he can undertake research projects that align with local government issues and focus on helping New Zealand be a more resilient nation. Philâ€™s current research focuses on predicting the impact of floods using machine learning.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated

can see the presenter screen phil<br>thank you<br>yes awesome yeah<br>show you my face online so you can just<br>check if it's i am the guy you expected<br>maybe<br>okay shall we start um thank you very<br>much for being here today<br>kia ora everyone<br>yay i do bless i see some very<br>good people in the room so i've got some<br>very nice<br>here<br>um so i am<br>filming<br>and<br>i would say that<br>i am both a researcher at the artificial<br>intelligence institute but also a senior<br>regional hazard advisor at the waikato<br>regional council<br>and<br>of course you have seen the topic of<br>today it's about flood and artificial<br>intelligence<br>so if you are not leaving now if you are<br>interested<br>so but before i started i really like to<br>show you a bit of uh<br>thing that uh it doesn't sound like it<br>but<br>i am from france and after eight years<br>in new zealand i've totally lost my<br>accent<br>and<br>so i saw it's incredible<br>and<br>i just want to show you um<br>so<br>how can i get next<br>uh where i come from actually from the<br>mountain area here on the french side of<br>the hubs<br>uh any city named granola where i did my<br>phd in geophysics<br>and i spent<br>more like 15 years<br>hiking and climbing the mountain<br>chasing rock falls no avalanche debris<br>flows<br>and<br>and i learned a lot in the field about<br>natural hazard and at this<br>at the stage i was developing<br>instrumentation and monitoring system<br>for predicting and anticipating any<br>natural hazard that could happen and<br>impact<br>human life and human structures<br>so i worked a lot for council for any<br>organization that have an area to<br>protect<br>and uh<br>and i've been using a lot of geophysical<br>techniques actually for reaching out<br>this ability of security<br>but<br>this is the france that i know but today<br>france is looking like this actually<br>it's red<br>so this is the latest information that<br>we are showing from the every then about<br>100 districts in france<br>that are in level red crazies level four<br>highest level regarding the drought<br>the heat wave that actually impacts<br>europe and especially france so what<br>does that mean it means that as you can<br>see on the right of course it's in<br>french there is different level of alert<br>and it start from the first one which is<br>low be careful to the latest one crazies<br>on the bottom right<br>and here the government have to take<br>action regarding the use of water<br>and that means at this level water is<br>forbidden to use for any use even<br>agriculture and even for people for<br>drinking water it's very limited<br>so we have actually a 100 village in<br>france that don't have access to<br>drinking water anymore this is totally<br>out<br>so of course when you go to france if<br>you<br>get the luxury sometimes to visit paris<br>it's gonna be like this with this nice<br>fountain but today it looks like there's<br>no more water anymore restriction of<br>course<br>and uh<br>and there is a very nice pictures of<br>from satellites showing on the left<br>uh france<br>in 2021 in july and<br>on the right uh the same kind of angle<br>showing a likely in july 23 so 2022 so<br>it looks very brown<br>uh<br>for france<br>so yes if we are looking to the rainfall<br>actually at the<br>precipitation from the last 50 60 years<br>uh yes this month of july is breaking a<br>new record it's very very dry than<br>average<br>2021 it was a little bit above this is<br>on right side of of of the plot<br>but we have seen the last five six years<br>in france precipitation lower than use<br>than normal and there is consequences of<br>course and i just put one actually for<br>instance the nuclear plant of pakistan<br>uh uh this is a place in france that<br>they used to uh pour energy from nuclear<br>and it's they have to be shut down<br>because the uh the water of the river<br>the temperature of the water was too<br>high though they could they could not<br>call enough<br>the engine so one of the consequences<br>for instance<br>but it's not only france here is a map<br>released by the union<br>the european union is showing that<br>there's a lot of differences<br>when the heat waves<br>hits france and germany england uk and a<br>bit of space spain what we have on the<br>north spot in sweden and norway we have<br>unusual wet conditions we have flooding<br>in sweden and norway a lot of flooding<br>and in france we have not enough water<br>this is a tweet from yesterday actually<br>from the world meteorological<br>organization saying that yes we had one<br>of the three warmest july on record<br>of course but<br>what's shocking me is this sentence<br>antarctic ice lowest on record for month<br>of july and you know that in new zealand<br>we are impacted uh about what's going on<br>in antarctica<br>so here is a zoom of this uh world map<br>of the<br>surface air temperature anomaly for july<br>2022<br>and you can see that the red areas are<br>not specifically over europe and france<br>and space but we have also some unusual<br>high temperature over antarctica that<br>means<br>the heist is melting quicker than<br>expected<br>i found in an article in july of course<br>that we are beating recording from this<br>is from the famous newspaper french<br>newspaper or mundo<br>where there is a written and i<br>didn't do the tradition we can get it in<br>english straight away now<br>internet uh that was an historical<br>moment uh for vote and heat in france<br>and i was thinking oh my god how is<br>going to be in new zealand but yeah<br>it was<br>yesterday i mean not yesterday three<br>days ago that we are as we are being<br>recording new zealand as well<br>in july for the last month the witness<br>july and record for new zealand<br>so yes um it's not only breaking record<br>about rain but also temperatures and<br>wind but of course what we get in mind<br>it's probably the rain<br>so this is getting done and back to<br>waikato so on the left side i put up<br>the waco media manual total run for uh<br>so you can see what we got how much rain<br>we could expect in a year in waikato so<br>showing the wet area in waikato which is<br>on the north carolina and those in the<br>king country in waitomo and a bit north<br>of uh south of the lake topu and this on<br>the right is just a screenshot from the<br>wagon regional council website of<br>vermont data hub<br>where it's showing the<br>the cumulative rainfall for the last 30<br>days and what it showed that we are<br>getting into extreme as you can see on<br>the top of the chrome model we get<br>actually more than expected and we reach<br>about 20 to 30 percent what we should<br>expect in a year in the same area<br>same case for the white thermo thousand<br>and a little bit everywhere actually uh<br>that we got much more water than we use<br>so let's take a look to probably three<br>places in the north here in the just in<br>the middle of the of the crow model yes<br>it's showing<br>january to july rainfall in percentage<br>um to the normal and it's showing that<br>july has been<br>twice<br>what as usual<br>okay for the north of the car model<br>let's have a look to hear kaima kaimai<br>range<br>and we have a bit of the same pattern<br>but more rain in may that means that the<br>last three months in this area the<br>catchments get saturated and saturated<br>enough water so that next drop is not<br>gonna get not gonna get inside it's<br>gonna get straight away run off and go<br>to the river<br>another example here in the white tumult<br>where we get of course the same kind of<br>pattern from may to july but we had this<br>kind of things in february with more<br>than 200 of what we should expect in the<br>months but if we get a quicker look at<br>this february month this is february and<br>what it showed that we had almost 180<br>millimeters in one day the 12th of<br>february<br>you probably remember what happened 12th<br>of february actually it was about the uh<br>the storm caused by the ex-cyclone davis<br>which land a little bit uh north of<br>white tomorrow and i've impacted the<br>maricopa uh village here some pictures<br>from the stuff and then the remarkable<br>value here<br>and if you know the area or even if you<br>don't know i really recommend to visit<br>the maricopa 4 which is very nice for a<br>picnic on the sunday on sunday sunday<br>but what it looks like<br>on the saturday 12th of february was<br>recorded by one of the florida fisher uh<br>of the wagon regional council is just<br>amazing the amount of weather that's<br>getting done from the fall<br>and uh and and of course all the<br>consequences of all these<br>water causing slips<br>and landslides everywhere<br>but recently uh the 15th of july yes we<br>had no floating no or not far actually<br>from hamilton but it was not caused by a<br>big storm like the ex-cyclone doe it was<br>just because it was too much it was just<br>too much and then the water couldn't<br>stand a chance to get uh into the river<br>channel so here north in hamilton and<br>other um very nice footage from uh<br>hayden from the waikato regional council<br>showing huntley<br>and<br>some of the properties have in fact been<br>impacted by<br>the<br>actually<br>when i speak about flood i always<br>started with this slide<br>this slide showing 2021 contemporary<br>west coast<br>and<br>yet the damages<br>in 2021 was a breaking record again a<br>record breaking on uh yemen of insurance<br>claim<br>about<br>270 or 280 million of dollar in<br>insurance<br>claims for 2021 and it was just a little<br>bit over the last record breaking record<br>which was in 2020 which was about 200<br>million of dollar of insurance claims<br>as you can see on the contrary side it<br>was about 50<br>million<br>of dollar cost and the waste cost was<br>about 85 million of dollars<br>but what happened just uh recently on<br>the news bi the insurance council of new<br>zealand uh put a newsletter saying that<br>we have already reached 200<br>million of dollar of insurance claim and<br>we haven't take it to account july<br>so how is going to be for the 2022 are<br>we breaking a new record<br>of flood damages in new zealand<br>maybe<br>a last things to show this is this nice<br>diagram not to um spoke about the<br>climate change impact but showing you on<br>the left side<br>this is the number of floors by<br>day from 1978 to 2021 so what we used to<br>see in the mid 70s actually it was about<br>one to two floors every years but today<br>the new average is about four to seven<br>so this came from the entire project on<br>the flood prediction<br>so<br>i know this is a part two of the tile<br>project the part one you're gonna get<br>this in october so sorry about that so i<br>have to get you a bit of an overview<br>about what the entire project is<br>very quickly taiyo is uh<br>is um is um in the project win by the<br>university of waikato in collaboration<br>with university of canterbury oakland<br>with<br>and it's servicenbc seven years it will<br>end around 2025. so there is two main<br>focus on this entire project first is uh<br>focusing the focus the main focus is uh<br>developing data science for<br>environmental issues<br>but the first um<br>the first part of it is developing tools<br>for analyzing data and the second one is<br>organizing a platform for accessing to<br>the data it's open to wild uh value<br>of people from student to software<br>engineer and the big thing is getting<br>into<br>end-to-end science environmental<br>scientists with computer science<br>scientists<br>so what you should keep in mind about<br>the tio and if you want to get more<br>information just uh go on the website<br>tayawater.com<br>and what you can find it's a bunch of<br>information a lot of information from<br>tutorials if you want to learn how to<br>build your first machine learning model<br>go on it there is nice tutorials that<br>has been done by the teams which is over<br>40 or 50 people<br>we have not books actually you don't<br>have to write it from scratch but use<br>one that the colleague of you have done<br>and you can reuse it and adapt it for<br>your data and of course you can access<br>to<br>data it's a repository it's not a<br>database so that means it gives you<br>access to publicly available data in new<br>zealand so it's just a catalog of where<br>you can find some data and where you can<br>cross and check uh the the environmental<br>issue or problem you want to focus on<br>and maybe you can find some data that is<br>relevant<br>i want to introduce the team of the<br>fraud prediction it's not only me<br>there's a lot of people with me<br>especially nick lammy justin paul and<br>under the superior vision of three<br>professor at the artificial<br>intelligence institute here<br>uh with albert bernard and abe and just<br>to mention that there is a bunch of<br>people here that are really really high<br>skill that can really help you into your<br>journey<br>using machine learning so let's go in<br>deep into the uh the ro what you came<br>from actually um developing a flood<br>prediction tool<br>and uh<br>there is two especially when we started<br>the project<br>we're<br>just focusing on building a model and<br>that's it<br>and when we had this model in mind when<br>we had made this machine learning model<br>and it was working<br>quite well actually we were very happy<br>but we think<br>we thought about how we can<br>use it i mean the people from the wagon<br>regional council<br>they're saying me how we can really use<br>it youtube it's not very good but do you<br>have to use it or can you can we use it<br>how we can and then we think<br>okay so maybe it's a good time for um<br>deploying it how we can really deploy a<br>machine learning model so you have to<br>think about if you want that utility are<br>going to develop it's just for yourself<br>or your research but if it's for an a<br>real<br>world application you have to think<br>about the deployment and actually the<br>deployment is taking us a lot of time<br>because it's probably the hardest part<br>into<br>developing machine learning<br>but let's start by the beginning the<br>machine learning the the cool stuff<br>yeah<br>here it's a very quick summarize<br>actually i don't want to go into the<br>technical details but it's showing you<br>uh one of our best model<br>uh<br>showing the month of july 2017<br>and on the right we have the rainwater<br>here uh over the car model so we focus<br>first for this<br>experimentation<br>on the car model as you have seen we<br>wear places in waikato that we can<br>expect a lot of rain and especially here<br>the um<br>the the rain gauge in the blue dots is<br>pinnacles and<br>and on the right we have a river stage<br>gauge which is at taiwa and on the other<br>side we have<br>kaioranga river stage which is not on<br>the map but this one is specifically for<br>the tairwa river so we have on the top<br>left<br>this machine learning model over the<br>observed data so in blue we have the<br>ground truths what really happened in<br>july in<br>july 2017 and in oral range this is the<br>model and the model the predicted model<br>is giving a prediction in six hour in<br>advance<br>so it's looking really well we have um<br>some detail on the on the left the whole<br>the parameter that you have to use this<br>is a moving window of 15 days etc this<br>is a neural network on only using one<br>layer<br>but we<br>run this thing that's why you get this<br>animation because we run this model for<br>several epochs this is what we get a<br>better accuracy<br>of of the model the epoch is a recursion<br>thing that you're getting over and over<br>and you're trying to improve<br>uh to improve the losses<br>and this is the loss function on the<br>bottom of it so we<br>as long as you can run a model infinite<br>time but this is not the point so you<br>have to reach upon which the result is<br>efficient enough and accurate enough<br>that you can stop the model at this<br>stage otherwise it will keep running<br>fine too um to um to improve it<br>um<br>there were<br>good learnings on this because so what<br>we what we are probably a bit of a<br>detail that could help for for uh<br>forecasting time series one of the<br>machine learning algorithm that works<br>very well is lstm<br>uh for long short term memories so that<br>mean it's a neural network in a few<br>worlds that keep memory of the past is<br>not giving up in the future but it's<br>keep what happened in the past and then<br>you can reuse it so we learn<br>over the time so yes this is um actually<br>kind of a reference in time series<br>forecasting whatever you want to<br>forecast whatever you want to predict<br>the lstm is working well uh which is<br>very promising but uh<br>it was not easy because does that mean<br>that lstm fit for um<br>time series forecasting it will fit your<br>problem so<br>choosing a machine learning algorithm is<br>kind of a first part which is not really<br>easy<br>so you are first to choose it and then<br>you have to<br>play with the parameters as i said on<br>the on the left side you have to play a<br>little bit of different parameters which<br>will adjust and tune your model to the<br>reality that's why when you have a data<br>set you train it on probably uh<br>two-thirds of the data set and you you<br>use only one-third of the data set for<br>predicting exactly what you want to do<br>but it's not a perfect solution<br>uh of course as you can see it doesn't<br>think too<br>too well and sometimes it doesn't work<br>sometimes it's worked well oops too late<br>and the last thing was about um<br>for our<br>um for our case of predicting flooding a<br>catchment we cannot use the same model<br>for the kaioranga and the taiwan we have<br>to fit every model for each catchment<br>because you have to learn with the<br>proper data<br>of course<br>so the second part of this is about<br>deployment so probably<br>for giving you a better understanding on<br>how could it work in a real-time<br>operational environment<br>i have to tell you how we operate at the<br>waikato regional council<br>so<br>we are managing flood like every<br>regional council in new zealand<br>and how it works<br>there is a bunch of very nice people<br>actually i love them<br>just because they are here<br>and together uh we collect the data so<br>what what what data are available is<br>first our hydrological networks<br>managed by the wacom regional council<br>and we have access as well at the<br>weather information provided by med<br>service in new zealand so they provide<br>information and with all the information<br>as hazardous specialist and analyst we<br>uh get an understanding how it goes with<br>the experience as well and then we work<br>uh we awake at a regional council of<br>develop um a firmware which called the<br>from flood room live<br>which is telling our stakeholder and all<br>the republican communities how it goes<br>when something goes wrong or and we got<br>to get prepared and we are operational<br>so there is actually two stage<br>monitoring where something could happen<br>so we<br>keep in mind i keep whether<br>we we are where all the data the input<br>and the information we can get and<br>activate it it's uh when it's something<br>already happened and we have to manage<br>it so another thing out of it is of<br>course different um<br>situation report and working close with<br>emergency management for um<br>putting those intelligence people so<br>what we want to do actually<br>what we want to do is putting our model<br>here in just in the middle for helping<br>uh operational guys that they that that<br>help them to anticipate so of course if<br>we can uh if we can know that a big<br>heavy rain is going to happen in the<br>next six hour that's good but how is<br>going to be the impact of this heavy<br>rain which area is going to be impacted<br>so this is where we would like the<br>information right in the middle of the<br>interval<br>so we have a few challenges<br>and one of the most one of the first<br>challenges is<br>so<br>where we are going to deploy this model<br>actually if we have only one source of<br>data which is probably white cat<br>original console let's say that we will<br>put the model<br>in the webcam original console servers<br>and we're going to run it<br>but what if we've got several source of<br>data for instance how are you going to<br>manage that<br>and this is where we got a data<br>governance framework in place where we<br>have different multi source of different<br>workflow and we have to handle it the<br>second thing what we want actually for<br>running our model we want reliable data<br>is reliable and consistent of course<br>so we must be sure that the data that we<br>are handling for the model are good<br>enough and well protected of course<br>so what is the data management solution<br>and this is where we i'm going to speak<br>about the concept of data meshing so<br>data meshing is very new if you don't<br>know about it don't be shy it's just new<br>even me i just learned about it a few<br>months ago<br>so it started in two um 2019 and it was<br>a response to the growing number of data<br>source and the need for any business to<br>get more agile<br>so this is exactly what we need for the<br>flood prediction<br>we need a model that in the principle is<br>decentralized and distributed<br>architecture<br>so we don't want to gather all<br>information in one place and<br>and feel a lot of database of the such<br>information that we can reduce but<br>actually we want to access to the data<br>in real time and that and let the data<br>provider manage their own data and be<br>responsible for their quality<br>and their management<br>so how we can really build that so just<br>a comparison with the data mesh with the<br>old traditional way that we are<br>kind of collecting data that we call<br>data lake or data warehouse this is like<br>what it says actually this is just a<br>house where we could put all the data of<br>course for the machine learning this is<br>a good<br>good way to operate because we have all<br>our and we can really operate but it's<br>not uh efficient for the long term and<br>it doesn't fit data-driven approach this<br>is what where we are going now if we<br>really want to use this artificial<br>intelligence we really need to have a<br>data-driven approach even in the data<br>management<br>so hi guys just a quick example this is<br>the traditional um data structure that<br>we have put in place we have one source<br>of information the wagon research<br>council giving uh giving the review<br>stage and rainfall from the rain gauge<br>and<br>send the data to the entire engine which<br>is building the machine learning things<br>and then taiyo is about to predict this<br>model as as you have seen before to an<br>operator to a user actually probably me<br>as a hazards analyst and then i'll be<br>able to see what it's going to be<br>predict for the next hour<br>but how does that work if i want to add<br>one other source of information and i<br>want to give the information to the<br>other guys i don't want to be the only<br>one receiving the information<br>so we are increasing the input and the<br>output this is where we got a problem<br>so what we're gonna do we have to put<br>this machine learning outside of the box<br>and we have to get into about this what<br>we call the kafka system the kafka<br>streams this is our data mesh engine and<br>actually what it goes it's just some<br>sort of a highway that is<br>running the information into the output<br>to the into the output etc so now what<br>we have is a distributed system where<br>every entities which is an input or an<br>output can communicate each other so for<br>instance waycaro could discuss with a<br>user uh using the tile maybe the<br>machine learning model but it could<br>speak as well directly to your user just<br>providing the information because<br>everything<br>don't need to go<br>in machine learning and gene but one we<br>can link to we can link to other data<br>warehouse traditional way of storing<br>data and then we can access to them into<br>the pipeline et cetera and with this<br>sort of architecture which is actually<br>what we developed at the institute<br>we can see bigger<br>and<br>and we can see bigger and we can add<br>more<br>source of information and this is really<br>a model that fit data driven so what we<br>want at the end<br>for better prediction<br>we need more data<br>so we can add and work with other<br>entities and not<br>collecting the data but just using it in<br>so the next step is of course this is<br>very nice this is the engine<br>yeah that is running the call but what<br>we need what we need is dashboard so<br>this is what we're working on at the<br>moment so a way to present the data it<br>must be online a website this is what we<br>actually develop it must show a map and<br>showing actually where um the um<br>where the<br>bad thing is going to happen in the next<br>three six to nine hours<br>so providing with layers so we're gonna<br>put data that is not processed like for<br>instance the rain radar for instance<br>some information directly from the<br>instrument rain gauge or river level and<br>also some of the prediction that i've<br>been running by the machine learning<br>model and give you an understanding of<br>what which area is going to be<br>in trouble with the next heavy rain<br>but<br>here we're speaking about modeling river<br>stage<br>what is going on in the river we can<br>even use a bit of a<br>digital elevation model to see how it<br>goes around the river but we don't know<br>much about the impact so how we can<br>cross that information with impact<br>because<br>the main focus here<br>is predicting the impact this is is this<br>is the way that is going to help our<br>emergency management and and communities<br>response so of course we can add some<br>layer but i will call them statics<br>because some sort of the layer is<br>urban area it could be buildings<br>it could be infrastructure that we know<br>where the bridge here we know where the<br>road here etc but we don't know about<br>real time we don't know where the people<br>are<br>where uh how many people<br>are using this road how many people are<br>in this hospital how many people in this<br>school at this<br>time specifically so<br>we found that we could fill a gap with<br>developing a new application a mobile<br>application which is a very simple<br>natural hazard reporting tool so it<br>works very um<br>it's very simple and it use your uh of<br>course your smartphone and what it is is<br>an application that it takes a picture<br>you put a tag and you submit it<br>so you've got it very simple you take<br>your picture<br>you just label it because of course we<br>will need this level for instance you<br>can choose for something else<br>so something in um and uh already<br>pre-defined like a floating like a file<br>like a sinkhole or a landslide and then<br>you send it to a server<br>and what we want of course at the end of<br>it what we will have is a nice map we<br>pulled upon at the picture because all<br>the pictures will be will be geolocate<br>located so we've got the gps tag on the<br>pictures we can see we can know when and<br>where and we have an understanding of<br>what happened exactly in this place and<br>this can be run this can be used by<br>anybody<br>uh<br>uh on the go<br>and then we can construct uh um a<br>knowledge of information time to time<br>but at the end what we would like to do<br>is<br>a bit more than that more than a<br>dashboard showing that where<br>uh what we have is um<br>um integrating our computer vision<br>modeling on this for helping to<br>determine automatically for some of the<br>images that are not tagged for instance<br>that could recognize that it's a flood<br>and<br>what is impacted what we can see on the<br>picture for instance here this is an<br>empire this is a road and it will give<br>you it will give us with the gps tag of<br>the photo exactly where it is it it<br>could give us a car it could give us for<br>instance recognize automatically a<br>building etc etc so we wanted to build<br>this data database of knowledge with all<br>the people just by taking a picture of<br>it<br>another example here<br>that at the end we have to<br>get the machine learning learn how to<br>recognize a flooding or a landslide<br>and again the impact so here recognize<br>the road<br>yes um a few things what we learned<br>today uh so<br>terra is the fuel of<br>artificial intelligence so we need data<br>of course more data we have uh more<br>prediction we can do but does that mean<br>that the data that we have will fit your<br>problem<br>so when you got an issue and especially<br>an environmental issue you have to think<br>about what data i need to solve this<br>problem and then you can run some<br>machine learning but not go the way<br>around and using machine learning and<br>asking yourself what data i need now<br>machine learning is not a solution it's<br>just a tool<br>uh what we have seen as well is for<br>developing more data driven approach we<br>need more data<br>especially with high quality but we need<br>as well a more adequate data strategy<br>uh we need an environment for managing<br>data that fit the purpose of real-time<br>streaming and getting the information<br>together and not building database or<br>information that we cannot use<br>and of course that we have to think<br>about ai like not solving one problem<br>but multiple problem for instance it can<br>fit uh data<br>recovery it can fit data cleaning it can<br>fit the purpose of<br>understanding a problem or understanding<br>a leg or<br>in data it can do a lot of things<br>uh and of course you are really lucky<br>here to have the white kettle uh in<br>huayg institute with a branch of uh<br>researcher really high level skill that<br>could really help you and collaborate in<br>the future<br>um<br>in conclusion i would like to say that<br>we are organizing a big event<br>uh this is the first in new zealand yeah<br>we bring a new recall uh so this has<br>been<br>the first hackathon<br>ai for the environment is going to<br>happen here in uh in waikato but also in<br>five place uh it's a nationwide event<br>auckland wellington donating in<br>christchurch but the main i would say<br>the main things will be here at the<br>waikato<br>university it's going to happen the<br>eighth and the ninth of september<br>two days and what we're gonna do here<br>for this hackathon in the challenge<br>event so you're gonna build a team and<br>work on a specific environmental issue<br>and you're gonna use machine learning to<br>try to find a solution so the thing is<br>it's a big collaboration between<br>environmental scientists and of course<br>computer scientists so make a team<br>and work on some of the issue that you<br>can help new zealand to face<br>and there will be another very big thing<br>actually if you want to start with<br>machine learning there is a very nice<br>course<br>the day before so the seventh of<br>september a deep learning course which<br>is for beginner to intermediate so even<br>if you just started you can get this<br>school a one day course here at waikato<br>hamilton and you can practice for the<br>two days for uh during the hackathon<br>yes<br>and i think that's it for me today uh<br>again the platform taiyo.ai for more<br>information and the arkansas<br>and i'm happy now to take any question<br>any questions here no it's a great day<br>yes we have about 20 minutes too<br>yeah<br>um so i have two questions um in regards<br>to<br>uh the citizen science<br>approach<br>are you<br>considering like survey123 as like a<br>platform for<br>having the geolocated<br>photos and labeling<br>on<br>kind of as an automated system<br>and then the second question<br>is for the um<br>for how<br>the flood is impacting<br>things have you considered using um<br>fragility functions<br>um as<br>like a percent damages<br>yeah that's very good<br>thank you so the first one yes we<br>uh we thought about the um survey one<br>two three<br>uh we<br>wanted to develop one hour on our own<br>because we wanted to well manage the<br>engine behind for the computer vision i<br>know that no history is developing a lot<br>of things but we are i mean the team is<br>more a computer science that your<br>special scientist so i think for a guys<br>a gis experience will go to the survey<br>but i think it's a very good tool and we<br>use survey123 actually for the web for<br>different things it's working well we<br>really wanted to push a little bit more<br>further we didn't know much about the uh<br>how we can get into the system of the s3<br>things so that's why we decided uh to<br>create one on on our own but yeah there<br>is you you right to mention that when<br>there is tool outside it's better to use<br>it but when it's handled by big company<br>we don't want to have the ai as a black<br>box we want to manage and control it as<br>well<br>so<br>really different things for the second<br>thing is um it's about fragility<br>function so this is where you get into<br>the risk assessment and i've got hype<br>specialist over there so i will try not<br>to<br>to to say wrong things but um<br>they said at this stage when you have<br>when you want to um to analyze the<br>exposure and the race so when you want<br>to correlate<br>there is damage into dollars into money<br>actually<br>uh the thing is fragility function is<br>is not<br>uniform it depend of country and depend<br>on a lot of things and and it depends on<br>a lot of areas actually and<br>and it's very hard to use so there is a<br>nice<br>again using something that already<br>exists risk<br>very nice software is is doing that<br>stuff and i<br>and i highly recommend to use it because<br>scientists from new zealand are working<br>on this fragility function because if<br>you want to use a european fragility<br>function for road for instance then<br>you're going to get probably wrong<br>information about how it could cost if<br>you're impacted so careful a lot with<br>the fragility function this is probably<br>the uh the thing that you're the the<br>weakest point into the risk assessment<br>when you want to convert this damage is<br>to to tunnels<br>but yeah there is risky very nice<br>software and no i'm not doing it in this<br>case because i don't want to see how<br>much it's going to cost this is<br>insurance i want to see where are the<br>so phil in terms of the prediction<br>tool<br>and using obviously a lot of data to to<br>feed into the<br>uh<br>into those processes<br>i would i would have thought that the<br>the weather<br>prediction side is quite important<br>so<br>even if you are able to get some really<br>good predictions using existing data of<br>rain that has fallen and how that rain<br>can propagate through the systems<br>but is<br>do our forecasting<br>predictions need to be better<br>to be able to get better flood<br>predictions<br>so do you mean that we could use<br>tradition prediction into our prediction<br>model<br>production data into our prediction<br>model so so in terms of met service<br>forecasting yeah is the accuracy of<br>their forecasting sufficient to be able<br>to<br>enable your flood forecasting<br>predictions or<br>does the met service forecasting need to<br>increase to get your better predictions<br>so actually we do not use any<br>data that has been uh models so we don't<br>use any forecasting weather<br>that's why<br>and this is where you can just<br>adding a lot of uncertainty into your<br>model if you are using data from another<br>model from another module so<br>for this project actually we are just<br>using um<br>re<br>uh<br>real data from the field that means only<br>what happened and try to predict the<br>future just with the data that we have<br>and not the data issue from moto because<br>we can also use for instance this is a<br>very good example uh we have used<br>actually the uh the rain forecast from<br>the service and it didn't improve i<br>could have shown you a different uh plot<br>that we got it didn't improve at all our<br>prediction was really weird<br>and and at some point we wanted to add<br>how the catchment uh his state of the<br>catchment actually when you have for<br>instance three months of rain it's<br>really saturated and we don't have a lot<br>of soil moisture data<br>uh and any catchment so we wonder maybe<br>we could use some of the soil moisture<br>model<br>from niwa for instance that they have a<br>model of the soil moisture in different<br>places to grid<br>over the waikato area<br>and to improve it but this is how you<br>can handle the uncertainty from the soil<br>motion<br>from the uh issued by a model<br>to put into another model and this is<br>exactly the example as well when you get<br>the uh<br>the reverse stage and you got the uh the<br>rating curve actually from the stage to<br>the flow and of course uh this relation<br>will be updated quite often or otherwise<br>but at some point this is only this is<br>also a model so at some point it could<br>impact on the prediction as well so i<br>think that<br>i don't want to say that we don't want<br>to use any data from model because the<br>good thing of ai we can build data that<br>we don't have<br>but be careful of you know of uh adding<br>up a lot of uncertainty from this modal<br>enemy and you are not able to handle all<br>the uncertainty together<br>yeah<br>i think if we have one hands up i'll<br>zoom we should uh turn up and turn up<br>um i just have a question so on<br>slide 35 so you you should<br>parameters<br>include<br>rainfall and<br>river<br>and using machine learning you can you<br>can predict<br>river levels and<br>just curious um<br>good<br>um<br>blood extent on<br>um page on slide 45<br>you're breaking out a little bit um so<br>you<br>you you said about the dashboard right<br>and uh you wanted to know about your<br>special information about dashboard how<br>we can get the uh<br>the information of<br>about this sorry i didn't get it yeah<br>yeah so<br>there's flood extent<br>um<br>so<br>so i'm wondering how you you you can<br>predict this flood extent with um input<br>parameters like um river levels and<br>rainfall<br>oh cool okay i get it<br>so um so this is actually another part<br>of<br>of the project which is using geospatial<br>information and gtm<br>for lidar information for instance when<br>we can<br>extend this is what we do actually for<br>uh flood modeling this is where you the<br>model is giving the uh<br>uh the way that when it's uh over there<br>the<br>environment of the river is going to the<br>low-lying area so it's just playing with<br>the dem lot which is not totally ai<br>we've got tools to do it for um having<br>the extension when you put an amount of<br>flow in the rivers actually which use a<br>lot of ladder information<br>and different hydrologic parameters<br>but we don't do any ai on extension<br>actually<br>um<br>i've got uh two quick questions so i'm<br>sorry i'm just trying to clarify from<br>the previous question earlier so you<br>don't use any service forecast data to<br>feed in<br>correct so the the time scales with<br>which you can look out into the future<br>is basically the the length of time<br>between the rain falling at some station<br>up catchment<br>and then you can provide information<br>about how flooding will occur down<br>kitchen is that right<br>yes okay so<br>does that mean that you're sort of<br>you're quite constrained as to the<br>the first of all the the length of time<br>over which this<br>heavy rainfall event will occur<br>so you might be able to do some things<br>better for a one day extreme this is a<br>five to extreme this is a one-hour<br>extreme<br>um<br>so i guess that the quality of the<br>information you might be able to provide<br>will be<br>constrained based on i guess the size of<br>the catchment that's involved in the<br>area is that right<br>um<br>so this is where you want to put some<br>physics on it so actually when we use<br>the data driven we do not use any kind<br>of uh<br>hydrological parameter of the catchment<br>so the size the slopes the vegetation<br>coverage etc etc we don't put it into<br>the um<br>into<br>the machine learning we only use the<br>data that we have which has been museum<br>sites which is only points that's why<br>the rain gauge is giving us the amount<br>of water at one point but this is why we<br>are using the rain water because the<br>rain water is treated so you we can get<br>the amount of water at<br>some sort of i don't remember the size<br>of the sail but each shed is escalated<br>so we can sum up for instance and<br>delineate these catchments for instance<br>with the rainwater and having a better<br>view overview of the amount of water in<br>the in the catchment and not at the<br>specific rain gauge and of course uh we<br>use the range the river stage which is<br>measured the gauge at the bottom of<br>course of the catchment and<br>the next question will be if you don't<br>have the information can you do<br>something it's under research this is a<br>good point how we're going to deal with<br>and coach uh engage um cachement<br>uh<br>we have looking on it but not very um<br>actively for for the moment but there is<br>a few things that we can use and we hope<br>that maybe in the future with some<br>satellite images and satellite product<br>we can probably having this information<br>from space even if we don't have this<br>from the field<br>i guess a very quick follow-up to that<br>is<br>to what extent will will<br>uh the quality of the information you<br>provide<br>depends on<br>uh how extreme<br>uh historic event you've seen in the<br>time series and the input data that<br>you're fitting in yeah uh you know<br>is there a way in which you might be<br>able to get a gauge as to oh the worst<br>thing on record for the records that we<br>have was actually not that bad we're<br>somewhere else it was you know exactly<br>it's a very good point actually because<br>directly you cannot predict something<br>that never happened in the past so you<br>have to you can predict only something<br>that could have happened in the past<br>because but<br>this is some sort of machine learning<br>but there is new algorithm that is<br>looking at them of detecting that<br>extreme the extreme and this is where we<br>are<br>all about climate change and what the<br>climate model that they are using<br>actually because nothing happened in the<br>past and and and we really have to<br>predict what it's going to be in the<br>future so is working on different<br>aspects of it which is extreme detection<br>and extreme prediction which is another<br>topic uh<br>i reckon<br>but yeah uh<br>that's a very good point yeah thanks<br>yes<br>um i have a question maybe<br>maybe simple but um<br>i wonder what's the advantage of using<br>machine learning instead of physically<br>based models and at which stage<br>is disadvantage is it<br>time simulation time is it a number of<br>parameters<br>yeah actually<br>because with a few i would say<br>with some data you can predict something<br>but with a physical model you need a lot<br>of um<br>data from understanding the catchment<br>and the hydrological aspect of the<br>catchment and you need high quality data<br>so if something wrong in the data your<br>physical modeling at the end will be<br>wrong so it's really hard to handle<br>machine learning we are not looking at<br>all of the stuff so it's not working<br>better it's not working well sometimes<br>it's working much better but sometimes<br>not because there is a lot of other<br>parameters which is totally computers<br>computer things<br>but it's in time processing so i can<br>model and predict the next six hours in<br>probably<br>one hour two hours time which is take<br>for instance for having the weather<br>prediction six to nine hours for uh for<br>a new model a forecasting model which is<br>based on physics<br>so we hope that we can get um this<br>information more in real time more<br>quickly and and and using less power as<br>well because i cannot run any weather<br>model on my computer but i can run a<br>machine learning model for predicting a<br>river stage on my laptop<br>yeah<br>yes<br>two questions following up from some<br>other ones<br>um first one this is obviously your<br>expertise area not mine but it's the<br>model taking into consideration both<br>historical information for the catchment<br>and<br>what's currently falling at the same<br>time to help predict the impact<br>yeah yes correct um and then from that<br>um considering that climate change is<br>happening and the intensification of<br>rain is becoming worse and as we're<br>seeing it just in this past month how is<br>the model taking into consideration that<br>and kind of i guess minimizing the<br>uncertainties around that to help us<br>communicate with communities and so what<br>events and potential impacts with these<br>events that we've never really seen<br>before<br>yeah<br>um<br>we don't we can probably i<br>thought about it but we can probably put<br>some of the<br>factory parameters which could um get an<br>id with um with the climate change and<br>fixer that we can we can do with the rcp<br>etc so we adding some coefficient maybe<br>to take into account what it could be in<br>the future but it's not the goal of the<br>i think this is not the goal and it's<br>probably only my director now depending<br>on how to use machine learning<br>but the thing is<br>uh<br>we can use it as another input for<br>instance uh i want to predict the<br>climate change because i would like to<br>uh i've got the historical data but as<br>you as we said before we cannot predict<br>something that never happened so what we<br>should use another set of data<br>that could help us to um<br>to replicate or<br>uh getting better accuracy on the stage<br>of the river stage funds and all the<br>rainfall<br>using another information that we get<br>about climate change and what i can say<br>when i said for instance we can really<br>be open to any kind of data for instance<br>in my model<br>is using only a river stage and rainfall<br>but i could use the high smelting in<br>antarctica why not it could help me the<br>variation of the time of the ice melting<br>of antarctica will probably<br>get a new information into the model<br>for getting more accurate i can use<br>social information social data is when<br>people are moving whatever economic data<br>i can recall that as well i can use any<br>kind of data of course that it could be<br>relevant so one you have to think about<br>this data that can put i cannot put my<br>for instance the size of my shoes on the<br>side of the every shoes in new zealand<br>is that related to the topic of course<br>you understand but if you think that<br>there is a variable that could<br>impact the model<br>you can easily put it into the model and<br>see how it goes<br>as i said the first thing that i saw at<br>that started was to put the rain uh<br>the rain forecast from the service i<br>said oh medicine is already giving us<br>the next six hours why not using it and<br>then maybe i will get better prediction<br>but actually<br>it was not worse but it was not better<br>at all so was not<br>you know and<br>such lstm<br>algorithm which is based on neural<br>network<br>yeah this is a big factory this is<br>something that<br>i don't think that a lot of people<br>understand really how it works so even<br>for me it's still a black box i'm using<br>the ls team and i know that<br>i could play with different parameters<br>different input different data and i<br>could get a better<br>output but i'm not and<br>my role actually i'm not good enough to<br>understand how it works for getting the<br>right parameters but i know that i can<br>use something that i will never use for<br>a physical model for for instance the<br>ice melting for the antarctic ice<br>melting but probably in a data driven<br>approach yes<br>any kind of information could fit into<br>it<br>yeah one question so what i understand<br>now is that the service has moved to a<br>best prediction model where they look at<br>the ensemble and they manually pick the<br>one that they think the meteorologists<br>think is the best so what that means is<br>that on any given two days you may have<br>weather forecasts underpinned by a<br>different physics model how would that<br>affect your the performance of your<br>machine learning model<br>um<br>so i think the using the ensemble it's<br>it's also a goal for the machine<br>learning<br>prediction as well<br>what he's going to do is doing a lot of<br>a lot of model outside and trying to<br>find which one is going to fit and then<br>doing some kind of operating pixel over<br>that's exactly on the same way that but<br>not using the physical one so<br>how he's gonna impact um<br>i don't know uh i think<br>it's always<br>i don't know i don't maybe i don't know<br>it's simple that's<br>a secret commission but keep in mind<br>thank you<br>uh so including all of the other data<br>that you can include<br>um<br>has there been consideration of also<br>using this for coastal flooding<br>applications as well<br>exactly that's a very good point so we<br>can put for instance tights we can put a<br>storm surge information into it and we<br>can<br>we can focus on a specific area which is<br>on the coast and then we can have a<br>prediction on the innovation and the<br>cosmetics totally yes effectively<br>yeah any kind of information and you can<br>drive your model out of it so of course<br>you are uh you are getting from the fuel<br>to the coast of course so you're<br>shifting a little bit of your goal but<br>if it's where you want to go yes yeah<br>totally<br>yeah<br>i have one more<br>question and is that a viable to kind of<br>consider the effects of the sediment<br>transporting the fusion<br>producing some uh in the south island<br>there could be a quite a lot of the<br>flash floods and the riverbed channel<br>can be raised a lot or<br>insights quite<br>quite a lot about the flash floods<br>so that will change the its 10 of<br>flights in a very short time and how do<br>you think it will impact the efficacy of<br>the model in the future a lot a lot<br>yeah it's exactly that when you have<br>actually an event that<br>that is happening<br>just after the event the hydrologist<br>should go in the field and take a new<br>measurement and gauging again the river<br>and getting the new value of the profile<br>and the<br>velocity of the river because exactly<br>when you have the opposite erosion of<br>things and you change<br>the the way that the next information<br>that you got the next data that means<br>the next river stage is not exactly the<br>same physical condition so of course the<br>machine learning will take into account<br>this is the data but it will see some<br>continuity and maybe it will drift the<br>model a little bit<br>on the on wrong prediction and it will<br>probably after a while stabilize and get<br>back to normal but yeah the good thing<br>would be that when you got from there<br>and even like this and we have a lot of<br>sediment transport and changing of the<br>the channel shape<br>it could be uh it could impact it could<br>impact<br>okay if not i think we have reached one<br>hour so i think we can end this seminar<br>and thank you very much for attending<br>this one<br>thank you very much<br>and<br>so thank you it's pretty much like<br>being touched any questions really happy<br>collaboration<br>uh if you want to make a link with uh<br>webcam or into console or air institute<br>if you want to get some guys uh around<br>and working with you and your program<br>just here you can reach out and then i<br>will<br>have it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
