professorial lecture where uh<br>alex we uh we're looking forward to<br>hearing from you and and celebrating<br>with you<br>we acknowledge your excellence in this<br>achieving this outstanding promotion we<br>also welcome<br>members of the academic community of<br>otago<br>academic staff students colleagues<br>members of the<br>public of ottaputi dunedin and also<br>especially to people online members and<br>of the wider general public friends and<br>supporters of alex<br>from all around the world we have<br>special guests within the audience here<br>your wife kath<br>raymond<br>and<br>rachel your grandkids connor and paige i<br>want to acknowledge<br>and i know online um<br>there are people such as um<br>hannah and toby watching from california<br>i understand that uh things might be<br>quite<br>challenging with you so our hearts go<br>out to you we've had our challenges here<br>in ottawa with rain and it's just so<br>unfortunate that we can't easily take<br>our abundance and help you with your<br>with your issues but we wish you all the<br>best for the challenges that lie ahead<br>and to to others uh near and far welcome<br>welcome and thrice welcome again um my<br>role is uh a little bit of mc and<br>overview i'm the deputy vice chancellor<br>for research and enterprise at the<br>university and am here representing the<br>vice chancellor tonight just to give you<br>a little bit of a of a landscape map<br>before i introduce associate professor<br>vivian anderson to to introduce alex's<br>talk<br>we really want to celebrate success and<br>academic success here at the university<br>of otago and in career progression and<br>promotion being promoted to the level of<br>professor here at the university of<br>otago is a pinnacle achievement it is a<br>difficult<br>achievement because our academic roles<br>require balance between teaching<br>research and service<br>and achieving what we call sustained<br>outstanding leader leadership and<br>competence in at least two of those<br>three areas is the minimum requirement<br>for promotion to professor<br>and i i i can't understate the the level<br>of<br>outstanding leadership and competence<br>that's required we use international<br>referees to assess performance against<br>global standards and<br>we'll often say that a dedicated career<br>academic could devote full time to<br>achieving uh outstanding leadership and<br>competence in only one of those but we<br>have three categories and i believe that<br>solc was<br>achieved in all three of those<br>categories for alex<br>working in a professional context early<br>childhood education and teacher<br>education<br>provides an opportunity for research to<br>inform that teaching context but also<br>for the professional practice of<br>teaching to inform research and and our<br>your performance and your role has<br>exemplified what we expect out of an<br>outstanding academic here at otago<br>you have<br>impact through your research and<br>engagement with profession you're a<br>popular and sought after supervisor in<br>multiple programs master of teaching and<br>learning the phd and i would like to<br>stress our professional doctorate the<br>educational doctorate<br>you're an effective and successful<br>teacher from the 100 level all the way<br>to the 900 level and engage in your<br>professional activities you're teaching<br>in research with professional bodies<br>policy and practice through the teaching<br>council ministry of education advice uh<br>ero and the<br>university cuap<br>it it's it's just my privilege to be<br>here to be able to uh share with you at<br>this occasion tonight alex and<br>in reading your resume i also found that<br>we are in some ways twins because your<br>academic journey<br>matches mine and starting from the<br>mid-90s at the university of canterbury<br>finding that 2011 is a good year to<br>reassess<br>one's position in the shaky place<br>coming to otago in that year as i did<br>and then establish establishing yourself<br>successfully here at the university of<br>otago where we are both very proud of<br>having been academics at the university<br>of canterbury and we come here as<br>ambassadors of tape waipunamu in the<br>wider<br>tertiary sector here so please on behalf<br>of the university of otago accept our<br>congratulations on this<br>well-deserved promotion and i'll now<br>hand over to associate professor vivian<br>anderson to give a more detailed<br>introduction<br>noraera nakoto tenekoto tinakota katoa<br>welcome to you all family members<br>friends colleagues of alex professor<br>alex gunn<br>it's really exciting to be here tonight<br>and to celebrate with her her promotion<br>to professor<br>so it's my privilege to introduce alex<br>and to provide a very brief introduction<br>to her lecture and i'm not going to<br>steal her thunder<br>so alex's professional story begins here<br>in ortiporte before 2011.<br>so she graduated with a diploma in early<br>childhood education from the then<br>dunedin teachers college<br>and a bachelor of education from the<br>university of otago in 1991.<br>her professional career in early<br>childhood education began at the otago<br>university nursery association<br>but then her educational story takes us<br>on a journey up the motu<br>she was awarded a postgraduate diploma<br>in arts from the university of otago in<br>1993<br>a master of arts from the university of<br>canterbury in 1998<br>and a doctor of education from the<br>university of waikato in 2009<br>so professor gunn has worked in initial<br>teacher education since 1996 which is a<br>really impressive record<br>initially at the christchurch college of<br>education as richard noted and then in<br>2011 she returned here to take up a<br>lecturing role at te karere<br>the university of otago college of<br>education<br>so<br>professor blakey has already noted that<br>a professorial promotion rests on<br>demonstrated strength in teaching<br>research and service and professor gunn<br>has excelled in all three areas she's a<br>very valued and skilled contributor to<br>our initial teacher education education<br>studies and postgraduate studies<br>programs<br>she's supervised numerous postgraduate<br>and doctoral students<br>and she's developed an extensive<br>research record<br>professor gunn has been involved in a<br>wide range of research collaborations<br>and since 2011 she's led or co-led three<br>teaching and learning research<br>initiative grant funded projects and<br>these are really special externally<br>funded projects funded by the ministry<br>of education and aimed at informing<br>education practice through research<br>partnerships with practitioners<br>professor gunn has an incredibly<br>impressive record of educational<br>leadership both locally and nationally<br>from 2014 to 2020 she served as our<br>associate dean teacher education<br>and during that time she led the college<br>through three initial teacher education<br>program reviews and that's an enormous<br>undertaking<br>in 2020 to 2021 she led a complete<br>redesign of our initial teacher<br>education conceptual framework to place<br>territory-based relationships at the<br>heart of what we do<br>to foreground place or whenua in<br>relation to our work into place to our<br>maori at the heart of our teacher<br>education programs and we're still<br>growing into living that conceptual<br>framework<br>professor gunn has led the profession<br>nationally as an elected member and<br>chair of the teacher education forum of<br>aotearoa new zealand or tefans council<br>an editorial board member and chair for<br>the new zealand journal of educational<br>studies and convener of the new zealand<br>council of deans of education early<br>childhood education advisory you can see<br>why i need notes<br>in 2021 she was appointed to the<br>ministry of education curriculum<br>advisory group and this is a ministerial<br>group which takes her outside early<br>early childhood education and is<br>advising the national work on the nzc or<br>professor gunn's contribution to<br>education and aotearoa<br>namu was honoured last year when she was<br>made an honourable fellow of the new<br>zealand educational institute and last<br>week when she was awarded the teacher<br>education forum of aotearoa new<br>zealand's sustained excellence and<br>teacher education award congratulations<br>alex<br>professor gunn will tell you about her<br>research but just by way of a very brief<br>introduction her work reflects a<br>fascination with how teachers beliefs<br>and values inform their practices<br>and the ways institutionalised<br>discourses shape thinking and practice<br>her lecture this evening reflects her<br>commitment to early childhood education<br>into themes of equity and empowerment as<br>foundational motivations for early<br>childhood teachers work<br>she will highlight the powerful role of<br>kayakul in supporting whanau to<br>recognize the uniqueness of tamariki as<br>learners and as people who make<br>meaningful connections with and<br>contributions to the world<br>in tonight's lecture professor gunn will<br>draw on the early childhood curriculum<br>framework te fariki and her research to<br>illustrate how intentional teaching by<br>qualified and sensitive kayakul in the<br>early years warrants our utmost regard<br>and attention<br>i think this is only the second ipl at<br>otago for early childhood education<br>scholar so this is a really auspicious<br>occasion i just want to acknowledge that<br>um so alex we're really thrilled to<br>celebrate with you your important and<br>fantastic mahi over many years um the<br>impact that's had on kayaking nationally<br>and the education community more broadly<br>and to celebrate with you this<br>well-deserved promotion and we look<br>forward to hearing what you have to<br>share with us this evening<br>kamehameha<br>foreign<br>in a typically discourse analyst manner<br>i'd like to begin this evening by<br>addressing the title of my talk tonight<br>learning right from the start<br>right as in well or good or proper<br>while also learning<br>right from the start wherever you think<br>that start might be and whomever you<br>think is doing the learning<br>i'm starting here because i really do<br>definitely want to leave you all with<br>the impression that there is a character<br>or a quality<br>to the work of teaching and researching<br>in this field of early childhood<br>education<br>that can be recognized as consistent<br>with particular expressed values<br>expectations and aspirations for<br>tamariki mokopuna and their whanau in<br>this country<br>and i want to say that we really must<br>pay attention to this<br>if the policy structural and practical<br>conditions<br>that we really must pay attention to<br>this<br>and that the policy structural and<br>practical conditions of this teacher's<br>work need to be commensurate with those<br>values<br>practices<br>and expectations all told<br>if we are to do good<br>by folk in this sector of education and<br>early childhood education and thereby<br>good by the country overall<br>we have to<br>pay attention to the concepts in the<br>second part of my title here<br>about empowerment and equity<br>in early childhood education<br>i'm hoping already that you can tell<br>that issues of power<br>and the self and the entanglements of<br>these by kayakulminga tamariki in the<br>early childhood years will start to form<br>the threads of my talk tonight<br>and so as a typical teacher i want to<br>give you a little bit of an overview of<br>what's coming in the next 40 minutes or<br>so<br>this lecture addresses themes of equity<br>and empowerment as foundational<br>motivations for the work of the early<br>childhood kaikal<br>in doing so<br>it aims to convey the powerful role in<br>the kayak of the kayakal and supporting<br>tamariki mokopuna<br>to recognise the termite in their<br>uniqueness<br>as a successful learner and in the ways<br>that they make meaningful connections<br>and contributions in the world<br>rooted in the internationally renowned<br>and indigenous early childhood<br>curriculum framework of te fariki<br>the introduction of which an<br>implementation of which has coincided<br>entirely with my career<br>i will share research data tonight at<br>examples of studies that i've been<br>involved with that illustrate how<br>intentional teaching by qualified and<br>sensitive kayakul in the early years<br>warrants our utmost attention and regard<br>i want to illustrate one that one of the<br>most powerful fatigue i want to<br>illustrate one of the most powerful<br>tools a teacher has<br>and with which they can open up the eyes<br>of everybody else to the uniqueness of<br>the child<br>so in time<br>i will come to a discussion about<br>assessment practice in the early years<br>and how through the power of the pen<br>or in other words through teacher voice<br>kayakul may author and authorize<br>children as subjects of a particular<br>kind<br>strong learners<br>with mana<br>who<br>when they stand strong in their language<br>culture and identity<br>may take their early childhood<br>experiences into kura into school into<br>what i want to talk about tonight is the<br>idea that kaiko especially in the early<br>years hold immense power<br>power to shape people's identities in<br>particular ways be those people tamariki<br>makapuna be thy parents me whanau fanue<br>katoa<br>be they themselves<br>be they other kai could be they student<br>teachers<br>and that to wield this power well<br>it takes critical thinking<br>sensitivity<br>a social conscience<br>an awareness<br>empathy<br>the capacity to write<br>the capacity to think<br>to analyze<br>to predict<br>these are capabilities honed through<br>study in teacher education<br>and through varied life experiences over<br>time<br>and these kaikal have a particular role<br>to play in shaping learner and parent<br>identities including helping whanau<br>understand what it might mean to partner<br>with others over the long learning<br>journeys of their tamariki<br>so that when those children head off<br>into school or kura<br>families go into those spaces too<br>expecting to stay in conversation with<br>their child's teachers about learning<br>i want to comment on the fact that<br>teaching and learning is tough it's<br>risky it's demanding work because at the<br>fundamental level<br>learning represents change and<br>oftentimes we resist that<br>but even though<br>teaching and learning is tough and risky<br>and demanding<br>it is also full of life<br>love<br>caring<br>risk risk-taking<br>grit<br>and an adherence to a longer-term view<br>in an ever-changing world<br>because when you teach especially in the<br>early years<br>the time we have is fleeting<br>but<br>our effect can be lasting<br>as tamariki more kapuna move<br>increasingly on and out and into the<br>world<br>so how come i know about this what is it<br>that gives me licence to claim such<br>truths of teaching of learning and early<br>childhood education while richard and<br>viv have given you a bit of an insight<br>already<br>but i hope to trace a little bit of a<br>journey next<br>that will tie some tie together some of<br>my own learning teaching and research<br>experiences to help explain<br>and i want to start here<br>to stay first off that timing is<br>everything<br>and in a profession where most of our<br>teaching happens<br>as we do life with children<br>when we are interacting over ideas that<br>matter to the child and matter to the<br>community<br>and when we provide timely feedback<br>through an appropriately timed comment a<br>question a remark<br>a wink<br>a smile<br>a knot of the head<br>you're always on as a teacher you are<br>always seeking for the child to<br>understand that at that very moment they<br>are on track or not<br>they are moving in the direction of<br>travel that they intended or maybe not<br>that they should keep going with their<br>current strategy or maybe try something<br>different<br>the timeliness of the teacher's response<br>is critical evidence to support the<br>person<br>to continue in pursuit of their goals<br>but also timing in the broader and<br>longer term sense matters as well<br>where and when you teach<br>the policy of the time<br>who's important to you and why<br>i learned about this in theoretical<br>terms when<br>i was here as an undergraduate student<br>i was introduced to the thinking of<br>early bronfenbrenner this is a name that<br>many of you may know<br>bronfenbrenner posited a theory of human<br>development and learning that recognised<br>how one's life experiences and<br>trajectories were greatly influenced by<br>not only your direct experiences the<br>things that happened to you in your home<br>your school or your local life but also<br>by the relationships between those<br>significant sites of living<br>your home your school your mirai your<br>church<br>so on and so forth<br>the broader cultural context of where<br>you lived matters and the time period of<br>that existence<br>i think of those pepe born since 2020<br>2021 whose lives have always known mate<br>corona<br>i think of my niece<br>and her family<br>in otautahi<br>who moved into our own broken house<br>there when after 40 seconds of extreme<br>earth shaking one saturday morning in<br>2010<br>they lost a home<br>the experiences of those children have<br>been uniquely formed in ways previously<br>unimaginable to us<br>as a direct consequence of where they<br>were born<br>when they were born and what happened<br>locally and globally thereafter<br>so in the context of my life as an<br>education academic and early childhood<br>kayaker<br>timing has been everything too i've had<br>the absolute privilege of being in this<br>field in aotearoa at the right time<br>in the right place with the people who<br>needed to be right there along the way<br>at the start<br>the community of scholars in kaiako who<br>helped orient me towards the social<br>justice inclusive education and child's<br>rights bases of early childhood<br>included people from the former college<br>of education barbara mckay<br>marg whitford alice turnbull<br>lynn foote and others<br>here at the university the lineup was<br>equally as impressive<br>ann smith<br>keith ballard<br>terry crooks<br>ted glenn<br>russell bishop<br>torua and godfrey pohatu<br>but as well as those people the broader<br>context of my work has been just as<br>important my time in early childhood<br>education has coincided with a massive<br>expansion of the field internationally<br>as well as here at home<br>also the emergence of early childhood<br>curricular of all sorts around the world<br>led significantly by our own curriculum<br>framework te fariki<br>which has occupied a great deal of my<br>interest in activism<br>my entry into the field<br>occurred concurrent with qualification<br>parity for early childhood education<br>that milestone paved the way for the<br>then dunedin college to be one of only<br>two providers of a new three-year<br>teacher education qualification for ece<br>and i managed to get a seat in that<br>class<br>i say managed<br>it was never going to be a sure thing<br>i'd had a fairly checkered educational<br>experience over time i've found that<br>many teachers have<br>i didn't get ue<br>but i had had quite a lot of diverse<br>life experiences and i could talk pretty<br>well<br>i got discretionary entrance to<br>university<br>and to the college and thankfully<br>managed to pass that first year<br>so i stayed<br>and i became one of several first degree<br>and diploma holders<br>entering the field at that time<br>becoming teacher<br>this was significant in the field<br>it rooted us in a profession and in a<br>professional body for sure this wasn't a<br>status that everybody wanted<br>some still don't<br>but<br>being teacher<br>could hold us accountable ethically and<br>professionally to standards within the<br>profession which aim to uplift the<br>another way that trust was being<br>actively built in the field at that time<br>was through an emerging local early<br>childhood research community local as a<br>new zealand based<br>you don't need to read all that on the<br>and this was happening through a<br>uniquely interdisciplinary and child<br>rights oriented approach to research<br>that has flourished in this institution<br>through the work of people like ann<br>smith and her colleagues at the<br>children's issue centre<br>being educated here myself<br>meant that my first research project as<br>an undergraduate student was always<br>going to privilege children's voice in<br>some way<br>and i went on to explore a question<br>about children's elaborate language and<br>storytelling situations now as a<br>soon-to-be teacher<br>i was all over the arts in arts<br>education<br>and storytelling was central to this for<br>me<br>storytelling was about kotahitanga<br>collectivism<br>learning to listen to others having your<br>suggestions heard<br>these were capabilities that were being<br>developed that were being developed in<br>me by people around me here at the<br>university<br>and the teacher unions that i was part<br>of<br>and these were things that i wanted for<br>others<br>i had learned that if a teacher could<br>arrange experiences and people and<br>things in a tight loose kind of way like<br>a storytelling circle<br>that the rules of engagement in that<br>space<br>could support children who might<br>otherwise not<br>to speak<br>to listen<br>to laugh<br>and to recognise themselves and each<br>other as worthy of being heard<br>and even for those who contributed by<br>way of listening and watching only<br>they were seeing what it meant to be<br>heard and to be respected as a person<br>who even if really fleetingly was<br>my project was about children's oral<br>language and storytelling was it<br>different to when children just spoke to<br>you you know<br>and<br>and casually how and why might that<br>matter well i found out of course as you<br>do uh when you first and research you<br>found the truth of these things<br>it was different i thought that was good<br>i didn't really know why that was good<br>except that at that time i probably<br>equated good with progress<br>and progress with more and when children<br>were storytelling they used more words<br>if they spoke for more time<br>they spoke more of a narrative structure<br>and progress of this kind is what we<br>were after this is a belief that i'm not<br>so sure of anymore<br>but i was really hooked by the potential<br>of research and research design<br>and so that scholarly trajectory got set<br>later i was to come back to that theme<br>of storytelling and let's be honest what<br>do you do as an academic you stand up<br>the front you tell stories about life<br>and love<br>so storytelling has been and will remain<br>as<br>a key part of what i'm doing through<br>life<br>but i came back to the theme of<br>storytelling in one of those tlris that<br>they've mentioned<br>when i studied with mandy bateman<br>margaret carr elaine reese<br>and we explored how kaiako in the early<br>years at kindergarten and at school work<br>to support children's narrative<br>capabilities<br>now the importance of oral language and<br>of narrative has become much more<br>evident in recent studies of children's<br>reading<br>work by elaine and libby and their<br>colleagues<br>has connected vocabulary and reading<br>oral narrative with reading<br>comprehension<br>and i became really fascinated by the<br>complexity of children's thinking<br>of their storying of their play<br>and in how kaiako could deliberately<br>support this through the planning of<br>learning environments characterized by<br>free play<br>so i'd like to share a little bit of<br>data from the tlri to illustrate this<br>the participant you're going to hear<br>from is jacob he called himself jacob in<br>the context of our research and i<br>recorded data with jacob at kindergarten<br>one afternoon<br>he and some friends were playing in the<br>sandpit<br>teachers were working freely in and<br>around with all children<br>jacob was leading the production of<br>multiple storylines over a period of<br>about 30 minutes or so before he looked<br>over to me<br>took off his microphone i'd been on the<br>other side of the playground videoing<br>the action<br>held his microphone up indicating to me<br>that for him data gathering was done for<br>the moment<br>i'd recorded jacob's story making across<br>three discreet narratives which came to<br>intersect in really interesting ways<br>firstly jacob was owner of dog<br>and dog needed to be instructed<br>to do specific things as he learned how<br>to be dog properly<br>second<br>jacob was car truck driver and crasher<br>crashing over ramps and threw troughs<br>all over the sandpit and thirdly<br>jacob became a burglary instigator<br>as a robber narrative took took shape<br>within a family story about mum's dad's<br>kids in cars<br>which also<br>involved a visitation by dog<br>and a renegotiation over car ramps<br>between other story partners<br>here's a bit of data from this last<br>story that shows how the story lines<br>came to intersect<br>and what was happening here was jacob<br>and mitch had been<br>who identified as boys had been playing<br>with toy cars two other cisgender boys<br>rory and kurt they came over to ask to<br>join them they were told no you can't<br>play with us<br>oh well<br>mitch and rory<br>with two of the cars were driving round<br>jacob was doing his own driving kurt<br>stayed sitting on the edge of the<br>sandpit watching because he'd been told<br>he couldn't play<br>and then rory<br>and mitch and<br>kurt and jacob all kind of converged at<br>the end of the scene at the edge of the<br>sandpit and this is what happened<br>i'm<br>see<br>mums and dads and kids<br>can't<br>move<br>i love this piece of data for so many<br>reasons<br>from it i can comment on the teachers<br>work even though they're not directly<br>there in the play<br>but they had a hand in designing the day<br>in terms of time for children to develop<br>long play scripts<br>they had a hand in deciding what kind of<br>resources would be available to children<br>to play with<br>these were deliberate decisions made by<br>teachers that had direct consequences<br>for curriculum and learning<br>i can talk about jacob's bringing<br>together of these three discrete kind of<br>narratives across a whole range of<br>different people<br>his ability to sustain<br>and complexify the storying<br>the ideas that the group bring to the<br>broader robber family narrative<br>and of course<br>kurt's position<br>in this part of the story at the end<br>here<br>we're occupying the role of mum is not a<br>possibility for him<br>but<br>a family setting where two dads is<br>offered up instead<br>now i'm really interested in this last<br>bit of mum's dad's kids and cars<br>it reflects the second major trajectory<br>within the research that i've worked in<br>over my career<br>and this is a line of work concerned<br>with curriculum that has at its centre<br>concerns for social justice equity and<br>inclusive education<br>my work has particularly concerned<br>social justice in terms of sexualities<br>matters<br>gender<br>and how in early childhood education we<br>might facilitate inclusion diversity and<br>here i have four iterations of our early<br>childhood curriculum framework te fariki<br>now recall my point from earlier<br>when i said about the importance of the<br>ecosystem of a teacher's work<br>well i was a beginning teacher when te<br>fariki was first in development<br>there<br>and then<br>i was leading a team of kayakal when in<br>1993 the second version of the framework<br>was formally trialled in the field<br>now the service i was working in was<br>part of the nationwide evaluation of the<br>early implementation of te fariki<br>and in 1995 when that work was in full<br>swing<br>i was fortunate enough to be sent as a<br>union delegate to the sixth early<br>childhood convention in tamaki makoto<br>with long-time friends and collaborators<br>claire wells and linda mitchell<br>in a plenary session to that conference<br>i sat listening to tilitikoingl now lady<br>ready<br>and she described tefatiki its basis its<br>aspirations the wittle it set for the<br>profession that i was finding my feet<br>within<br>is about empowering the children to<br>learn<br>and this is a message that she and many<br>others have repeated at every<br>opportunity since<br>this empowerment<br>manifest in the concept of mana<br>is what really described as the<br>principal outcome of te fariki<br>the child is nurtured in the knowledge<br>that they are loved and respected<br>that their physical mental spiritual and<br>emotional strength will build influence<br>and control<br>that having mana<br>is the enabling and empowering tool<br>to controlling their own destiny<br>i really do remember thinking then<br>huh<br>is this what i signed up for<br>and then i thought huh<br>and so<br>once the 1996 version of that curriculum<br>framework was published<br>i was well and truly sold<br>on the potential of this tool as a means<br>of coordinating early childhood practice<br>with children and whanau across the<br>multi<br>next my research interests really<br>centered started to centre around social<br>justice and equity and in particular on<br>the issue of heteronormativity<br>heteronormativity if it's a word you've<br>never heard of is about the idea that<br>heterosexual sexuality<br>is<br>upheld as a normative standard that it<br>and<br>this happens<br>through straight curriculum<br>in our early childhood settings<br>now my kids they were being raised in a<br>lesbian-led household<br>their lives as such and those of their<br>friends who were similarly located<br>were completely absent and talk about<br>representations of and conceptions of<br>family reflected in early childhood<br>teaching practice at the time<br>having warned the brunt of much<br>heterosexism and homophobia myself<br>including from my own kids teachers<br>as well as students<br>and colleagues<br>who would raise their eyebrows and<br>accuse me and others like me<br>of pushing our own barrow too frequently<br>in discussions of hidden unintended and<br>exclusionary curriculum<br>i knew that i was going to have to be<br>less strident and more strategic<br>if i was going to be able to lead<br>through research towards change<br>i understood the early childhood<br>teacher's role in empowering the child<br>i also understood that most students i<br>worked with<br>and most teachers in the field were very<br>committed to this idea of uplifting and<br>growing the manner of the tomati<br>in a context of partnership with their<br>whanau<br>if i could document the ways in which<br>heterosexual sexuality was being imposed<br>and institutionalized<br>within everyday thinking and practice to<br>the extent that alternatives to this<br>were rendered other absent immoral wrong<br>then i could ask a question of fairness<br>about this<br>and if i could do that it might be<br>so at about this time<br>i met margaret carr and sue middleton<br>who at the university of waikato agreed<br>to supervise my doctoral study into<br>heteronormative discourse and practice<br>it was a formidable combination<br>and it provided much scope for<br>wide-ranging critical and complex<br>thinking and discussions around the work<br>and beyond<br>now that study asked is and if so how is<br>heteronormativity shaping teachers<br>practice<br>an<br>inaudible to the socio-historical<br>political context of campaigns for civil<br>unions<br>marriage equality<br>and the care of children's legislation<br>that was pretty much concurrent with the<br>field work of this study i didn't pick a<br>great time to do it but there you go<br>i dedicated this research to those we<br>have yet to recognise<br>this was a remark on the fact that even<br>if in education<br>we failed to name<br>to not include<br>to not notice and not reflect or engage<br>with certain people who mattered to<br>children<br>that those people still mattered to<br>children<br>and i expected that this could and would<br>change<br>in fact when you read this discursively<br>that is the work of the yet in this<br>dedication<br>we've already seen in that mum's dad's<br>kids and cars data that children's<br>understanding of the world and different<br>possibilities for it<br>can sometimes exceed those of the people<br>around them<br>and although we don't know for sure<br>whether kurt's suggested to dad's family<br>was reflective of a family type that i<br>hoped it might be<br>it's possible<br>especially when kayaking design learning<br>environments in ways that truly share<br>power with the child<br>that privileges the child's sense making<br>and stays open to the diversity and<br>creativity of what children know and can<br>do<br>anyway<br>this study showed light on how<br>historically rooted ideas of gender<br>sexuality and the family all very<br>important concepts to children you<br>understand<br>how these concepts were driving certain<br>anxieties certain thinking certain ways<br>of practicing<br>and ideas about what was normal or not<br>what was to be worrisome or not<br>what was appropriate or not to include<br>an early childhood curriculum<br>structures of binary gender of normal<br>early childhood sexuality development<br>and the nuclear family<br>were repeatedly upheld as moral<br>as legal and as healthy and what people<br>said and did<br>and in each of those trajectories in<br>their own right concepts overlapped they<br>rayified each other and they were<br>strongly rooted in the workings of<br>heteronormative discourse<br>quietly<br>and persistently repeated the statement<br>heterosexual sexuality is<br>understanding that this occurred and how<br>this occurred<br>freed us up to recognize and resist the<br>impositions of the heteronorm on every<br>body<br>because to posit the world in a<br>heteronormative way<br>was to raise questions of equity of<br>inclusion and of injustice for everybody<br>and when kayakul could draw licence to<br>question that using te fariki as a tool<br>to do so<br>they could connect more readily with<br>different points of view<br>children and families different<br>experiences<br>and open up different possibilities for<br>learning and i just want to give you a<br>brief example<br>marion had been talking about a teacher<br>in the centre that she worked at<br>and she said another teacher another<br>lesbian teacher at the center<br>had made this story<br>the mama bears she'd made it with two<br>mama bears well actually<br>there's about 10 bears you can chop and<br>change and choose whatever you like but<br>a teacher came to me the other day and<br>she said she was reading the story or<br>telling it outside and she was choosing<br>two mama bears<br>and one kid said<br>how can there be two mama bears<br>and this other boy piped up and said<br>well it could be a papa bear dressed up<br>in woman's clothing<br>and the teacher said<br>oh yeah well that could be it too<br>there is so much going on in this<br>exchange there's a genuine attempt on<br>the part of the kaiako to represent<br>family beyond the traditional nuclear<br>family structure<br>there is resistance to this idea or<br>puzzling over this idea<br>by someone who's listening to this two<br>mummers how on earth does that work<br>there's an offer by someone else<br>to reconstitute the family as properly<br>nuclear<br>mum and dad<br>but with a dad who dresses in a<br>and there's a teacher who stops short of<br>us of asserting the family as<br>lesbian-led<br>in this instance but<br>goes to recognize the suggestion made of<br>the questioning child's pair as<br>legitimate before moving on<br>now such interactions matter<br>being able to listen out for the<br>everyday ways we privilege certain forms<br>of knowledge and understandings while<br>including while excluding others<br>is an important aspect of the early<br>childhood teachers work this is because<br>as i said earlier<br>most teaching and learning occurs in the<br>interactions between people and things<br>in a place<br>and for the teacher<br>after the placement of people and things<br>in the environment and the scheduling of<br>times and routines<br>their voice is the most powerful<br>teaching tool that they have<br>so we must remain ever aware<br>of how it's used for what ends and why<br>and so i want to spend a few moments<br>next before i wind up talking about<br>teachers use of voice<br>and how through narrative assessment<br>practices<br>early childhood teachers can shape the<br>stories we hear and tell of the powerful<br>child learner in early childhood<br>education<br>now this piece of assessment<br>documentation is from a local early<br>childhood setting who did some work with<br>me in 2013<br>as i prepared an address around<br>narrative assessment as a tool for<br>community building<br>the photos and stories here were used<br>with permissions and i<br>committed then<br>to taking steps to protect the anonymity<br>of people in place in any presentations<br>or papers or for teaching purposes where<br>i use the material<br>but assessment practice has been a major<br>early childhood research interest for me<br>and the influence and wisdom of margaret<br>carr<br>of wendy lee<br>leslie rameka and many other friends<br>cannot be understated here<br>i think assessment is where the rubber<br>hits the proverbial road<br>in terms of public accountability for a<br>teacher's decision makings and action<br>taken in the name of teaching and<br>learning<br>narrative assessment in the form of<br>learning stories lasts<br>it transfers with children to other<br>places<br>your child's next teacher<br>can be greatly influenced by what they<br>read in children's assessment portfolios<br>these can orient them to children's<br>strengths their passions and their<br>interests<br>when that assessment is done well<br>it can and should directly inform<br>teaching and learning<br>and in the narrative form<br>assessment information helps author and<br>authorised subjects of a certain kind<br>opening up people's eyes to the wonders<br>of what children know and can do<br>individually and collectively<br>and to what kayak will contribute to<br>this<br>so i want to quote a little bit here<br>from a report to whanau and kaiako that<br>i made from the work that i did in 2013<br>with them i said<br>narrative assessments act as cultural<br>tools that support children and family<br>members to construct personal memories<br>and contribute to identity development<br>in the example here<br>the teacher writes<br>that they deliberately place these two<br>infants together<br>to see what these two would think of<br>each other<br>the documentation shows the children<br>looking<br>and touching each other<br>negotiating space<br>the story goes on to give an account of<br>these children as active meaning makers<br>who are jointly engaged with each other<br>in the context of a deliberate teaching<br>activity<br>the assessment shows learning and<br>community<br>but also special connections with human<br>and more than human others that support<br>the learning of the individuals in that<br>social space<br>a baby blanket<br>the floor<br>a mirror<br>but there are other stories that this<br>story is telling too we can see what the<br>kaiako has done here first and foremost<br>with ngape<br>they understand that these two would<br>likely be very very interested in each<br>other<br>that they might take encouragement from<br>each other to help them roll over that<br>they might take pleasure in gazing<br>intently at themselves and each other in<br>but more than this is going on<br>the kaikal has documented this<br>so that these people can later revisit<br>this experience<br>so that other kaikal and the early<br>childhood service can understand and<br>support this relationship<br>so that the family of these pepe can<br>appreciate the widening circle of<br>relationships that their tamariki are<br>entering into in their absence<br>fundamentally<br>this piece of assessment information<br>changes how we understand these pepe<br>as interactants<br>as capable interested people<br>learning in with<br>other and here's a second example it's<br>about max<br>and his working theories about how best<br>to retrieve a wayward carrot that had<br>grown in that space just between the<br>garden planter and the and the back<br>fence you've always seen it<br>this collection of learning stories came<br>from an early childhood setting in auto<br>tahi from a project there where teachers<br>and i were working on raising our gaze<br>from individual experiences to thinking<br>about working theories over the more<br>longer term<br>and the learning dispositions and<br>capabilities that were of value<br>i won't deny there is a lot to value in<br>each of these pieces of documentation<br>themselves but for those of you who work<br>in assessment with me now<br>you'll likely recognize i'd have a few<br>comments to make about other aspects of<br>the documentation like length<br>like audience so on and so forth<br>but really what i wanted to talk about<br>is how this car calls account how their<br>voice<br>opens up<br>so much to be learned about max<br>has strengths his capabilities and his<br>so the kaiko and the children had been<br>gardening some unharvested carrots were<br>noticed attempts were made to get them<br>one had grown in that difficult place<br>the group was thwarted<br>the teacher asked the children to plan a<br>different way to try and get that pesky<br>carrot<br>a few days later<br>max and the kyah call return to the<br>problem and they met with success and so<br>in the documentation the teacher has<br>written lots of max's ideas his actions<br>but they have also documented max's<br>courage and curiosity to work on this<br>problem<br>i've documented the fact that<br>max trusted that his views will be taken<br>seriously<br>his tenacity<br>has confidence to express his ideas in<br>different ways<br>the responsibility that max felt to<br>tackle and solve this problem of the<br>weywood carriage<br>these are the dispositions that te<br>fariki associates with successful<br>learning<br>and this is what<br>the the teacher is telling us about<br>and why does this matter<br>because this assessment information and<br>more like it is accounting for max as a<br>capable and confident learner and<br>communicator<br>somebody who is important enough in this<br>setting for their teacher and others to<br>take them and their ideas seriously<br>to write about them so others can<br>understand this of max too<br>and so that max<br>and later conversations with kykel with<br>peers with family members<br>can be reminded of this himself<br>and here's the real power i think the<br>thing that makes practices like this<br>about equity and empowerment overall<br>and another instance of theory into life<br>jerome brunner another scholar whose<br>ideas have influenced me greatly<br>told us we live our lives through story<br>we organize our experience our memory<br>for of human happenings mainly in the<br>form of narrative<br>stories excuses<br>myths<br>reasons for doing and not doing and so<br>on<br>and so for max to be able to read with<br>others about himself as a learner<br>who is able to shape the world and<br>accomplish much with others time after<br>time<br>well<br>max might start to believe it<br>and from those beliefs<br>fueled by the stories that we are<br>telling<br>draw strength for the forthcoming<br>challenges that he is undoubtedly going<br>and so i returned to the start<br>to my assertion that equity and<br>empowerment stand as foundational<br>motivations for the work of the early<br>childhood kayakul<br>recognising tamariki and their<br>uniqueness as successful learners with<br>mana<br>making the world alongside us in<br>community and through the everyday<br>and i return also to the people who make<br>this happen and there are a lot of you<br>here<br>the kayakal who turn up every morning to<br>a thousand ideas<br>to a thousand worries<br>to a thousand conflicts<br>and other happenings as they do life<br>with tamariki mokapuna and whanau using<br>their voice to author and authorize them<br>as subjects of a particular kind and i<br>and so as i come to the end of what i<br>wanted to say i want to take just a wee<br>few moments<br>to comment on what i have deliberately<br>i have not raised the possibility here<br>tonight<br>that early childhood education is the<br>preparation of children for so-called<br>real learning at<br>school nor have i talked about early<br>childhood education as a support for the<br>nation's labor workforce<br>i haven't talked about early childhood<br>education as a business opportunity<br>and i haven't engaged in that investment<br>mentality of early childhood education<br>at all including as a protective measure<br>for future so-called life course gain<br>to have done this<br>would have to detract it from the child<br>the whanau<br>and kayakul<br>and their very close work fashioning<br>each other in the here and now<br>where there's plenty of work for us to<br>go on doing<br>delivering on the promise of te fariki<br>which is empowering the children to<br>learn<br>norada everyone<br>thank you for showing up<br>tina<br>um<br>oh<br>is<br>oh<br>oh<br>oh<br>oh<br>i<br>and it's a great pleasure<br>that i get to have the last word and<br>that last word is to offer a vote of<br>thanks and i think appropriately a vote<br>of huge confidence in professor um alex<br>gunn so to do that um traditionally we<br>comment a wee bit on the lecture that's<br>just been presented so bear with me as i<br>do that um professor garner has acted as<br>a superb tour guide this evening for us<br>taking us through the progress of her<br>research and the interest that she has<br>had over her career she's demonstrated a<br>variety of research methods in so doing<br>and has communicated it all very clearly<br>and engaged us the whole way through<br>and particularly for me personally<br>seeing some of those uh learning<br>assessment stories that popped up<br>towards the end reminded me again of the<br>incredible education that my for um<br>tomatee received<br>from wonderfully talented ec kaiako here<br>in dunedin and the joy at reading those<br>um to see what they've been getting up<br>to<br>but also to learn several parenting<br>techniques along the way from those who<br>were more experienced than me<br>and i thought just worth you know<br>letting you know that<br>so my four children are beyond that now<br>the youngest one is nine um but we have<br>kept those books and they're piles of<br>them and they sit in each of our<br>children's what we call memory boxes<br>and the lovely thing is each of them the<br>eldest is 15 now<br>at times we'll go down to the storage<br>room and pull them out and read them and<br>so they really do have meaning beyond<br>just the moment and time in which they<br>were recorded<br>in addition to a masterful demonstration<br>of technique alex also steered us<br>towards the values and very human<br>concerns that have underlined her work<br>that children need to be empowered to<br>learn<br>and that such empowerment recognizes and<br>bestows on them mana<br>that knowledge and curriculum can play a<br>vital role in facilitating inclusion<br>diversity and equity and so achieves<br>social justice<br>and that leading through research toward<br>change is an incredibly effective thing<br>to do<br>she also reminded us of the serendipity<br>of timing<br>in life and in work and that has<br>contributed to her work that she was in<br>the right place to learn from a<br>community of scholars and that she was<br>there at the right time as her field of<br>early childhood education grew very<br>quickly and a curriculum framework and a<br>qualified profession emerged which gave<br>her much to focus on<br>earlier in the lecture profession told<br>us that kaiako hold immense power<br>and that to wield it well takes she said<br>critical thinking<br>sensitivity a social conscience<br>awareness empathy the capacity to write<br>to think to analyze and predict<br>i think it's clear from listening to her<br>tonight that her work has demonstrated<br>and embodied those values hugely so<br>for me professor gunn's research<br>encapsulates the strength of a humanity<br>scholar at work<br>she has been open to being moved by the<br>circumstances in the context around her<br>she has used her skill and ability to<br>address questions of human importance<br>and development and she has been driven<br>ultimately by values values of dignity<br>and equality she's making a significant<br>contribution to our society and i hope<br>generally having a wonderful time doing<br>it<br>professor gunn has shown us that the<br>teacher has much to give to the<br>development of our little ones and not<br>for the sake of all those things at the<br>end of her talk but for the sake of just<br>being them and how wonderful is that<br>and that helping them to do that well is<br>of lasting value for all of us so thank<br>you alex for giving us this opportunity<br>to peek into your work and into your<br>world<br>i have the great pleasure of presenting<br>to you this gift<br>as a sign<br>of our immense appreciation for this<br>evening but also for your years of work<br>and service at otago<br>kamehameha<br>um<br>alex gan
