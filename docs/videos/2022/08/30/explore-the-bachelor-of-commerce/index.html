accurate.</p><p>the single biggest lesson that<br>businesses have taught us is that money<br>does not make the world go round<br>and what i mean by that is that society<br>cannot function just solely based on<br>my name is cinderella george and i'm a<br>lecturer at the school of accounting and<br>commercial law<br>i think that businesses need to change<br>that i think that there are certain<br>values that for a number of decades now<br>have perhaps either not served us and in<br>the way that they should and that those<br>values not only need to change but are<br>changing and businesses themselves are<br>recognizing that there is an emphasis on<br>ideas of accountability and notions of<br>accountability such as corporate social<br>responsibility and i think what that<br>takes is a new generation of young<br>people who i can see are more<br>conscientious about<br>issues around climate change and social<br>equality or inequality there have been a<br>range of topics that i have studied<br>within my economics and public policy<br>major this has been covering from<br>child poverty to climate change to<br>social insurance it's really interesting<br>because each time you step into a<br>lecture theatre you don't know what<br>you're going to study and when you do<br>it's really interesting so there's a lot<br>of challenges in the world at the moment<br>and<br>the only way we're going to be able to<br>make it through those challenges is with<br>game-changing solutions<br>that's where innovation and<br>entrepreneurship really comes in it<br>helps you understand where the biggest<br>problems are and how to tackle them in<br>the easiest way possible to adopt<br>massive change and actually start to<br>address those challenges that we're<br>facing as a planet it's very exciting to<br>be a part of that drive<br>it makes me feel excited to go to the<br>workforce to be able to push for that<br>once i get there i cannot wait to see<br>what our generation does in the future<br>you would need to be passionate just<br>about the world around you from politics<br>and how government runs to<br>businesses and institutions such as<br>corporations and other forms of<br>for-profit organizations like that a<br>passion about how these organizations<br>run how they function and the important<br>goods and services that they deliver to<br>society i think people who succeed in<br>innovation are the ones that are<br>empathetic<br>that really understand the challenges<br>that people are going through<br>and can identify different ways of<br>solving those problems being empathetic<br>means to<br>yeah really feel for them and and to put<br>yourself in their shoes and if you can<br>do that really successfully you can be a<br>really successful innovator or<br>entrepreneur<br>the bachelor of commerce is about so<br>many different ideas and concepts and it<br>can't be narrowed down there are so many<br>different majors that you can take from<br>accounting to public policy to economics<br>to international business and the list<br>goes on and on i think fundamentally the<br>bachelor of commerce is about society<br>and it's about how our society functions<br>and the various institutions that help<br>it to function from government to<br>business and how those two sections of<br>society intersect so i think if i were<br>to summarize the bachelor of commerce it<br>is that it is about society and how<br>society runs<br>the core courses that i have done so far<br>i've found them to be very<br>thought-provoking and eye-opening<br>because they give a great base to some<br>of the majors that you can study here so<br>if you're not sure on what you want to<br>study just starting with the bcom core<br>is great because you'll instantly find<br>what you like and what you don't like<br>what's special about the way we deliver<br>our education here is that first of all<br>the lecturers i am so lucky to work with<br>just an incredible set<br>of lecturers teachers<br>who not only have an incredible<br>knowledge base but who research in the<br>fields and in the ideas and concepts<br>that they are teaching you a second very<br>special thing about the way that we<br>deliver<br>our knowledge is that it is very much a<br>conversation at least from the many<br>lecturers that i know and from the peers<br>that i work with we want to engage in a<br>conversation with you rather than just<br>bank a whole bunch of information on you<br>we want to talk to you we want to<br>understand your ideas you are the future<br>professionals you're going to be the<br>future both commercial professionals<br>public sector servants<br>and leaders of our country and perhaps<br>the world and the future entrepreneurs<br>we want to know what you have to say<br>we want to know what your ideas are and<br>have conversations one of the things i<br>really loved about doing<br>become was the ability of doing a<br>combination of group projects and<br>personal projects the group projects<br>really allowed me to hone my<br>collaboration skills and gave me a nice<br>sandbox for<br>learning how to do presentations and<br>learning how to speak in front of a<br>crowd<br>and really learning how to test run a<br>business was the personal projects that<br>gave me a lot of autonomy to push the<br>ideas i was the most interested in<br>forward<br>in a really<br>safe way<br>one of the big benefits i got through<br>attending victoria university and doing<br>a bcom was meeting a wide range of<br>people that i've continued to<br>collaborate with throughout my career<br>having a really strong network built<br>such a great foundation for being able<br>to<br>connect and collaborate ask questions<br>of my peers and i suspect that i'm going<br>to continue to collaborate with them<br>the degree is designed in a way that you<br>can take<br>any majors that you want that you can<br>take the degree in addition to other<br>degrees it's really as flexible as you<br>want to make it it's very easy to change<br>your major or minor or add and drop<br>courses it's as simple as going to a<br>course advisor and you can change as<br>easy as that<br>having the opportunity to learn from<br>guest speakers<br>really gives you that extra<br>understanding of<br>how people have tackled the challenges<br>that they've faced in their lives and in<br>their businesses and that's such an<br>awesome<br>awesome experience to be able to go<br>through<br>understanding the processes that people<br>have undertaken really allows you to<br>fast track your way to some of the<br>solutions you might be able to find in<br>your world or in your business just<br>starting a business is not easy there<br>are multiple factors and inputs that can<br>go into a business there's keeping<br>yourself disciplined but there's also<br>the accounting side of things or the<br>production management side of things<br>where the management major could come in<br>understanding how the economy works and<br>how your business is influenced by the<br>economy or understanding how government<br>regulations could influence your<br>business<br>we have been as a university able to<br>establish connections with future and<br>prospective employers in the government<br>sector in business as well so we have<br>fantastic links to graduate programs and<br>the ability to connect with potential<br>and future employers you can take that<br>bcom wherever you want to take it both<br>nationally and internationally as well<br>you can work for non-governmental<br>organizations globally in the united<br>nations<br>to charities<br>and a whole<br>host of public sector and also private<br>and for-profit organizations as well<br>i think wellington is a great place to<br>study business because we are in the<br>heart of it here in the heart of public<br>sector government is right next door<br>certainly to our puppeteer campus and<br>all of these public sector organizations<br>are all around us many large businesses<br>also operate just within minutes walk<br>away i'm learning about stuff<br>and it's right here i can study a<br>subject and be like oh these decisions<br>are being made in parliament right now<br>it's that connection that i don't<br>believe you would receive at studying<br>any other university to study business<br>in wellington is to have access to have<br>access to all of these parties uh that<br>operate in these institutions that<br>you're learning about so that is why i<br>think it's an excellent idea to study<br>i'm currently in the atom space here at<br>our papatea campus this is a fantastic<br>space that students can schedule<br>time to spend<br>to come together to<br>be innovative<br>to discuss their ideas either for future<br>businesses and ideas that they have and<br>to also engage with business leaders you<br>can really feel a sense of community<br>there's a series of events that they run<br>throughout the year where you can meet<br>and engage with people who are already<br>running their own businesses solving<br>challenges and governments<br>and entrepreneurs out there making<br>action so the items are really awesome<br>benefit of studying at victoria<br>university so if you're excited about<br>everything that we've been talking about<br>if you're excited about<br>changing this world if you're excited<br>about addressing some of these key<br>issues that we're facing as a society i<br>encourage you all to study a bachelor of<br>commerce and especially here at the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government wellington is waiting for you<br>it's a fantastic city and the<br>opportunities are going to be endless<br>for you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
