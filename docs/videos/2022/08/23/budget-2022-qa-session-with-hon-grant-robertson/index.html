we're<br>embedded in the heart of the city we're<br>just across the road in fact<br>and we draw on the expertise of the<br>businesses and government organizations<br>around us to inform our teaching and our<br>research<br>and we can do cool things like<br>twist the deputy prime minister's arm to<br>do these presentations every year<br>um and that's what makes us a bit<br>different as a business school and means<br>our students gain a set of valuable set<br>of skills<br>that prepares them for interesting<br>productive careers<br>so through our sort of unique<br>combination of business and government<br>expertise<br>we're embedded in the heart of<br>new zealand's centre of innovation<br>entrepreneurship<br>policy making and creativity so from the<br>beehive where we are to the weta cave<br>over in miramar<br>and to all the amazing<br>social entrepreneurs and all the public<br>servants<br>there's a lot going on in wellington<br>so hosting events like this demonstrates<br>our close connections<br>and physical proximity to<br>uh<br>all that's going on<br>and our unique track record of<br>so we're located in<br>rutherford house<br>which is just across the road<br>actually i'm probably facing the wrong<br>and the wellington school of business<br>and government plays an important role<br>in educating the next generation of<br>world-class business people and public<br>servants<br>and contributing to policy debates about<br>what's best for new zealand and the asia<br>so we're uniquely placed to develop<br>leaders that approach challenges and<br>opportunities from both commercial<br>governance and societal perspectives<br>it's that blend<br>oh we've lost<br>we've changed our photo we did have a<br>photo of one of our professors standing<br>knee deep in the harbour<br>he's a professor of<br>the economic impact of disasters and<br>climate change we don't make all our<br>there's plenty to get involved in<br>so the university has a really diverse<br>student profile<br>which enriches the value of campus life<br>and the unique perspectives and<br>experiences of all students and we have<br>over 150 student clubs at the university<br>that you can get involved in<br>and some of them are specific to the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government and we've just picked out a<br>few here<br>that are very strong within the school<br>of business and government<br>um so there's various students<br>associations plus we have a very strong<br>business and investment club<br>um the victoria business consulting club<br>which<br>goes to<br>consulting case competitions around the<br>country and they perform very well<br>and beta alpha psi which is<br>a club<br>that involves<br>accountants information

event<br>um the well-being budget 2022<br>so the government has a huge<br>responsibility to introduce policies and<br>regulations which help create<br>the social and economic arrangements in<br>which our society will thrive<br>and it is no easy task at any time and<br>particularly not<br>through a pandemic<br>so we're very fortunate to have the<br>honourable grant robertson here today to<br>talk to us about this year's budget<br>i'm going to introduce grant<br>he will present on the budget and then<br>after his presentation<br>i'll ask some questions that have been<br>sent in by schools but i'll also take<br>questions from the floor i'll start with<br>some of the ones that have been sent in<br>so you can start framing your questions<br>in your head<br>um and<br>by way of introduction i will do a sort<br>of this is your lifestyle um<br>introduction of<br>the honourable grant robertson<br>so<br>the honourable grant robertson was born<br>in palmerston north and grew up in both<br>the north and south island<br>so a man of new zealand<br>he studied politics at university and<br>was an active student politician<br>president of the otago university<br>students association and co-president of<br>the new zealand university students<br>association<br>so politics was obviously<br>in his blood from early on<br>after graduating he worked at the<br>ministry of foreign affairs and trade<br>and was posted to the united nations in<br>new york working on global environment<br>and development issues<br>and on his return to new zealand grant<br>became an adviser to former prime<br>ultimately grant's belief in social<br>justice and a desire to see every new<br>zealander achieve their potential<br>led him into politics<br>and he has been a member of parliament<br>for wellington central since november<br>2008<br>he's held a range of portfolios in<br>opposition and in government i won't<br>list them all<br>but grant was appointed deputy prime<br>minister in the 2020 labour government<br>as well as minister of finance therefore<br>responsible for the budget<br>minister for infrastructure and minister<br>for sport and recreation so i imagine<br>he's been celebrating the commonwealth<br>games<br>and in fact one of our bachelor of<br>commerce students<br>won gold medals<br>at lewis clairvert<br>in the swimming<br>so welcome grant and thank you very much<br>welcome to parliament everybody it's a<br>pleasure to see you all here today um<br>thank you jane very much both for uh<br>having us here today and your very warm<br>and fulsome introduction i was a little<br>bit worried you were going to run<br>through my school reports and other such<br>matters but please to be here today and<br>have a chance to talk about the budget<br>um the budget was a while ago the budget<br>was<br>in may and here we are in august and as<br>i go through one or two of the slides in<br>my presentation it'll highlight just<br>what an uncertain and volatile time<br>we're all living through because even<br>just in that short period of time quite<br>a bit has changed around some elements<br>of what we're dealing with financially<br>both here in new zealand and around the<br>world and i promise not to go on too<br>long<br>and therefore leave as much time as we<br>possibly can for questions i also do<br>take sport and recreation questions with<br>one exception any questions about the<br>all blacks coach go back to jane<br>not to me<br>minister of sport doesn't get to have an<br>opinion on that um<br>just as has already been indicated so<br>you know this is what budget looks like<br>this is it well-being budget we're all<br>about saving money so the photograph on<br>the front of the budget i took with my<br>phone when i was in up in the far north<br>of new zealand it's a picture of that's<br>the widescreen version of the picture<br>that's on the front of the budget um<br>it's up in the hokianga harbour<br>in the far north of new zealand a very<br>very nice spot so lest anyone think that<br>we're wasting money on expensive<br>photographs for the cover i took it so<br>there you go<br>but it is as has been noted by jane we<br>still call this the well-being budget<br>and very very briefly when i became the<br>minister of finance in 2018 i worked<br>with the treasury on trying to take a<br>more holistic view of the way we put<br>budgets together so basically in the<br>history of budgets in new zealand we<br>focus very much on financial and fiscal<br>matters and i'll talk about those in a<br>minute and they are still very very<br>important to what we do when we're<br>putting a budget together but we felt<br>that that wasn't a sufficient way of<br>understanding what we should invest in<br>and how we should measure our success<br>and so we adopted what we call<br>well-being budgeting and that means<br>looking not just at our financial or<br>fiscal measures but also at what it<br>means for people what it means for our<br>environment and what the budget means<br>for our communities and we use a<br>framework which we've designed with the<br>treasury it's designed by economists so<br>they talk about capitals so they talk<br>about financial capital human capital<br>natural capital and social capital i<br>prefer to talk about that as money<br>people the environment and our<br>communities and what we're doing is<br>trying to make sure that when we put a<br>budget together we're thinking about all<br>of those things and so the process we go<br>through when we're deciding what to<br>invest in means looking at the impact of<br>each idea each initiative each program<br>on all four of those measures that's<br>quite different both to how it's been<br>done in new zealand and how it is done<br>in lots of other countries in the world<br>it's a bit of a work in progress because<br>it's you know hasn't been done before so<br>we're constantly tweaking it i won't go<br>into it today but there are we're<br>trialling different ways of delivering<br>programs getting different government<br>departments to work together<br>rather than individually on what they're<br>doing<br>providing more long-term funding and<br>i'll mention a couple of examples of<br>that but that well-being budgeting idea<br>still carries on got a tiny bit<br>interrupted by covert although i would<br>argue that the approach that we took to<br>covert was very much a well-being<br>approach which is about looking at our<br>health our well-being of our people<br>alongside the costs and what we're doing<br>and we did prioritise as you know<br>supporting people through covert and the<br>health response to covet but we kind of<br>in terms of the way we put the budgets<br>together we paused a few of the actions<br>that we were taking to change the way we<br>do budgets but we've got back to a few<br>of those this year but as i say we do<br>have to talk about numbers and one of<br>the most significant things that was<br>going on as we were putting budget 2022<br>together was that the global economy was<br>beginning to really slow down<br>so obviously we've had the impact of<br>covert over the last couple of years the<br>flow on consequences of that are having<br>a big impact around the world<br>what we call and you'll often hear<br>referred to as supply chain constraints<br>what that really means is the demand in<br>the economy<br>has not been met by supply and in new<br>zealand that plays out really<br>practically<br>china continues to operate what they're<br>calling our zero tolerance approach to<br>covert and that means that they are<br>having still having lockdowns over the<br>last few months that means the port of<br>shanghai which is one of the most<br>important ports for goods coming to and<br>from new zealand has been closed up<br>until the budget it had been closed for<br>about a third of the year so that<br>literally means goods that we need in<br>new zealand haven't been getting here<br>but also goods that we send out to the<br>world haven't been able to get where<br>they're going either that's a specific<br>example of what we call a supply chain<br>constraint but there are others<br>including labor supply so people<br>actually being able to come here and<br>work and so all of those things have<br>been contributing to the economy<br>stuttering along a bit around the world<br>then you add in the russian invasion of<br>ukraine that's had a massive impact in<br>europe in terms of the<br>the way the economies in europe are<br>running conflicts between u.s and china<br>all those sorts of things basically<br>since the beginning of the year and<br>those forecasts have come down even<br>further since the budget so the<br>environment in which we're putting the<br>budget together has been incredibly<br>challenging to deal with good news is<br>that the new zealand economy within that<br>remains relatively resilient so yep<br>we've seen some dips um and they<br>coincide with the first wave of covid<br>and then the delta outbreak and now<br>you'll see that there's a general trend<br>in the economy going forward from here<br>that we're growing not as fast as had<br>been expected and that is because of<br>those issues to do with things like<br>supply chain constraints but generally<br>speaking the new zealand economy is has<br>been more resilient than others around<br>the world and that's been recognized so<br>i have to kind of go along and talk to<br>what are called the ratings agencies<br>these are the people who decide well how<br>what our credit score as a country is<br>and that matters because that defines<br>how much it costs us to borrow money out<br>in the world and the two big ratings<br>agencies um standard poor's and moody's<br>both have said either they've kept our<br>credit rating at the highest aaa or in<br>one case in sand and pause they actually<br>lifted it that means that that's<br>external people coming in having a look<br>at the new zealand economy and saying<br>it's in pretty good shape few challenges<br>here and there but the cost of borrowing<br>the money that we need to to borrow to<br>get through covert is kept relatively<br>low albeit that interest rates are now<br>going up so basically in a reasonably<br>strong position you can really tell that<br>when it comes to the unemployment<br>statistic<br>and this matters a lot to me i in in<br>during covert at the famous one o'clock<br>press conference podium that you all saw<br>jacinda and ashley at one day when i was<br>filling in for them doing that i had a<br>report in front of me from treasury that<br>said that unemployment would go into the<br>double digits into 10 plus as a result<br>of the impact covert and i remember<br>standing there that day and saying i'm<br>not going to let that happen and so<br>that's why we did the things we did like<br>the wage subsidies scheme and the<br>resurgence support payment and a whole<br>lot of other programs we've been where<br>we've invested in people so that they<br>are able to stay in their jobs and so<br>unemployment has come down significantly<br>much more than we thought it is forecast<br>to pop back up again in the later years<br>as um<br>and i'll come in a moment too as some of<br>the<br>changes economically impact such as the<br>monetary policy stance of the reserve<br>bank and just the general slowdown that<br>we're experiencing now but still it's<br>under where it's historically been as<br>you can see on the chart so we can be<br>pretty pleased and pretty proud of the<br>fact that we've kept unemployment low<br>because obviously that's vitally<br>important to people's uh uh jobs and<br>wellbeing<br>um in terms of what happens with the<br>surplus so in terms of what we call<br>obergal which stands for the operating<br>balance balance excluding gains and<br>losses um that's basically are the<br>government's books in the red or in the<br>black<br>as you'll see in periods where we've had<br>the global financial crisis which is the<br>blue bars there we go down into a<br>deficit and we come out of it again then<br>we hit<br>unfortunately covert and we go back down<br>into a deficit and you can see we're<br>forecast to come up into surplus<br>we've set ourselves the position so that<br>we will be back into surplus five years<br>after covert hurt<br>previously the previous government they<br>came back into surplus six years after<br>the gfc covered was a more severe<br>decline than the gfc so we're pretty<br>pleased with that but this comes to one<br>of the really big decisions that you<br>could make in a budget<br>we could change that<br>we could come back into surplus quicker<br>but in order to do so there are massive<br>trade-offs and one of those trade-offs<br>would be how much we spend on things<br>like health and education and housing<br>and so we could do it it's theoretically<br>possible<br>but the impact on people would be severe<br>and it brings me to one of the words<br>you'll hear me use a lot which is<br>balance when you're putting a budget<br>together it's all about striking a<br>balance and i basically had three things<br>that i had to think about when i was<br>putting this budget together getting<br>ourselves back to a more stable fiscal<br>position and i'll show you a chart which<br>has debt on it as well as is the surplus<br>deficit equation<br>dealing with all the costs of living<br>issues that are going on at the moment<br>that you all know about but also having<br>a long-term plan for new zealand where<br>we have jobs that pay more where we<br>lower our emissions where we have<br>security for you and your health<br>services and all of that so i had to do<br>those three things balance all of them<br>and so we think we've got the balance<br>about right but there would be some<br>people who would say no you should be<br>aiming to get back to surplus quicker<br>and<br>adopt policies that i would call<br>austerity which are about saying let's<br>cut those things and get back so we<br>think we got the balance about right but<br>that is where the trade-offs are really<br>come in<br>um in terms of what um the government's<br>doing and so the first of those goals<br>that i mentioned which is kind of<br>stabilizing our fiscal position<br>sometimes you hear numbers chucked<br>around about how much money the<br>government's spending it's really<br>important to think about that as a<br>percentage of the economy because if<br>you're just talking about the raw number<br>it can sound huge but actually the whole<br>time the economy is growing<br>and so governments measure themselves in<br>terms of the our spending as a<br>percentage of gdp as a percentage of the<br>economy and the long run average as you<br>can see is kind of around about 30<br>percent but when they're are tough times<br>like there were with the global<br>financial crisis and like there is with<br>covert then spending pops up above that<br>so we're up at around 35<br>um previous government got up to about<br>34 in the wake of the gfc but then<br>you'll see it starts to come down to<br>around 30 percent it's steady it's not<br>dramatic it's about the balance of<br>making sure that we're putting<br>sufficient money into the economy to<br>support the services you need but trying<br>to get that fiscal position back to some<br>sort of stability<br>on debt new zealand's in an incredibly<br>fortunate position<br>uh we came into uh<br>the<br>covert times with debt at just under 20<br>of gdp that's one of the lowest in the<br>world now new zealand needs in my<br>opinion to keep its levels of debt<br>relatively low we're a small country<br>we're prone to natural disasters things<br>like earthquakes and so on and we are<br>more susceptible to big global economic<br>shocks because we're an open trading<br>economy and we make our money by selling<br>things to other people we can't<br>keep our living standards where they are<br>just by selling and trading to each<br>other and so as a result of that debt<br>levels are traditionally low but they<br>are particularly lower and you'll see<br>those those levels there it's all again<br>measured as a percentage of gdp the us<br>and the uk and that uk projection's<br>highly optimistic and i would suggest in<br>light of what's going on over there at<br>the moment that line probably going the<br>other way<br>now but you'll see that new zealand's in<br>a strong position so low unemployment<br>relatively low debt<br>surplus coming within five years a<br>strong stable fiscal position and that's<br>number one of my goals of the budget<br>kind of ticked off<br>in terms of them where we go cost of<br>living i won't dwell on this because<br>you'll know about largely what we did<br>there but we came into the budget<br>realizing that with inflation starting<br>to head up there were significant<br>pressures on households and there's a<br>big list there of the things that we did<br>um since then we've decided to extend<br>out uh the fuel tax cut and the<br>half-price public transport so that now<br>goes through until the 31st of january<br>because the impact of those high levels<br>of inflation that you're seeing at the<br>moment are going to last a bit longer<br>we've tried to be pretty targeted about<br>what we're doing here there again are<br>alternatives and the opposition was<br>proposing widespread tax cuts to be able<br>to deal with with that our view was that<br>we needed something more targeted and<br>more temporary in order to get that<br>balance right but this was a different<br>budget in the sense that we had to make<br>these decisions pretty rapidly as we saw<br>the information that was coming through<br>i do just want to mention something<br>right at the bottom there which is<br>really important which is that it's not<br>just about<br>dealing with the impacts of inflation<br>like supporting people to have more<br>money to be able to deal with that we<br>also do need to get to the root causes<br>of inflation and one of those is around<br>the price of fuel so one of the best<br>ways of doing that is not be reliant on<br>oil so we're incredibly reliant on<br>imported oil for petrol powered cars we<br>all know that it's both good for the<br>environment and we'll be less<br>susceptible to price changes if we move<br>to decarbonise our transport fleet and<br>you'll see in a moment that's one of our<br>big priorities so that helps get to the<br>long-term issue of inflation but<br>something that's probably more in the<br>medium term is the price of food<br>so new zealanders pay way too much for<br>food<br>and the reason for that is that our<br>supermarket sector is what's called a<br>duopoly there are two major companies<br>that are involved in this someone's been<br>teaching this down the front here that's<br>good um and so there's and so that is<br>really important to us that we get to<br>the addressing that so<br>on the night of the budget we introduced<br>a law<br>that means that those two big companies<br>that are controlling the supermarket<br>sector can no longer put what are called<br>covenants on land so what they were<br>doing was land that was either near<br>their supermarket or around it they put<br>a covenant on it so a competitor<br>couldn't get in and buy that land we<br>passed the laws that means they can't do<br>that anymore secondly<br>we've asked them by the by october to<br>come back to us with a way in which<br>competitors can get to the wholesale end<br>so the goods that end up at the retail<br>the supermarkets<br>are also controlled by the same duopoly<br>at the wholesale end and so either they<br>come up with that plan themselves or we<br>regulate it and that means competitors<br>can come into the market<br>and the competitors who want to come in<br>have told us if we've got land to build<br>and goods to sell then we'll be here and<br>so that starts to get you to the<br>root causes of inflation and i did an<br>experiment when i went to australia when<br>i first was able to do that in june of<br>this year and i went into a supermarket<br>in australia and i walked around until i<br>found the new zealand cheese and i<br>discovered something that i had been<br>told was true it was four bucks a kilo<br>cheaper than what it was at the new<br>world up the road here<br>now the reason for that is lack of<br>competition in our supermarket sector<br>and so we can do something about it so i<br>just wanted to mention that yep we can<br>do all these things on the cost of<br>living but we do have to also get to the<br>root causes of what's causing them to go<br>up the big spending in the budget as<br>you'll know um you will have heard was<br>on the health system um we made the<br>decision that new zealand didn't need 20<br>different organizations all around the<br>country that were all that were managing<br>our health system we could do that with<br>a centralized body um here in and you<br>know based out of wellington that has<br>regional arms but doesn't have 20<br>different organizations plus we've<br>created the multi-health authority as<br>well at the same time we've got to keep<br>investing in all the things that we need<br>to make sure our health system is<br>providing to people significant<br>investments<br>in mental health<br>and strengthening the care that you get<br>when you go to your local doctor<br>ambulances and pharmac and so on<br>as i mentioned so with cost of living<br>but then the third part is what do we<br>want our economy to look like<br>and we've got to be able to both deal<br>with the here and now and the future and<br>the big thing for me as i describe it<br>our economic plan is a high wage<br>low-emission economy that gives economic<br>security to everybody<br>the lower mission and high-wage bits go<br>together and so for the first time we<br>took all the money we get from the<br>emissions trading scheme that's the<br>money that people essentially pay to be<br>allowed to keep polluting<br>and we took all that money and put it<br>into investments to reduce emissions and<br>there's a host of them<br>that are mentioned up there we did this<br>on the basis of our emissions reductions<br>plan that in turn was based on the<br>carbon budgets that the independent<br>climate commission presented to us so we<br>have a goal we have a series of goals<br>that get us towards our zero carbon by<br>2050 and these investments are designed<br>to support us<br>to get there<br>series of investments and how we manage<br>to grow those higher wage jobs so when i<br>talk about high wage jobs being the goal<br>of the economy it's kind of a code it's<br>a code for productivity<br>it turns out that productivity is one of<br>the most boring words in the english<br>language and people don't get excited<br>about the idea that we need it even<br>though it's really important so we<br>decided to talk about it in terms of the<br>outcome you get from productivity rather<br>than the means of getting there so high<br>wages are the outcome of being more<br>productive being more productive means<br>investing in the things that will get us<br>there so that means infrastructure which<br>i'll talk about in a minute it means<br>skills things like training<br>apprenticeships and so on it means<br>supporting small businesses it means<br>supporting regions so we're really<br>actively getting alongside the sectors<br>of the economy that we think will<br>deliver those high wage<br>low emission jobs<br>um mentioned before i just mentioned<br>their skills and training massive<br>investment for us in apprenticeships i<br>have to say it's one of the things i'm<br>the proudest of in our response to<br>covert we made apprenticeships free<br>and we made targeted trade training free<br>and about 190 000 people um have taken<br>that up and i can talk later on if you<br>like about why i think that's important<br>immigration remains important and this<br>is one of the big stories of the economy<br>right now<br>is that the those supply chain<br>constraints i mentioned before labor<br>supply is one of the biggest of those so<br>normally we would have we'd got up to<br>even having net migration of 70 000 but<br>you know averaging out sort of 30 40 000<br>a year net extra people coming into new<br>zealand we haven't had that during<br>covert the borders have been shut<br>and so rebuilding that back up is<br>important but we didn't just want to<br>build it and just<br>open up and not have a strategic<br>approach so you'll see the list there of<br>trying to be a bit more targeted around<br>what we're doing in terms of bringing<br>people in that's just started<br>but that will start to ease some of the<br>really big problems that a lot of<br>businesses are having<br>and as i mentioned critical to<br>productivity is addressing<br>infrastructure<br>country if you're stuck in traffic<br>you won't be able to be as productive as<br>you would be and that's the case all<br>around new zealand and unfortunately<br>over the years new zealand has not<br>invested enough in roads and transport<br>issues rail<br>our water assets the pipes underneath us<br>pretty much everything hospitals schools<br>you name it new zealand's underinvested<br>my favorite statistic which i'm on a<br>mission to ensure that every new<br>zealander hears me say<br>is that new zealand's population grew<br>from 3 million to 4 million over 30<br>years from 1973 to 2003.<br>it then grew from 4 million to 5 million<br>over 16 years from 2003 to 2019 so just<br>on half the time that we grew from three<br>to four million<br>but during that period we didn't build<br>the houses<br>we didn't build the roads we didn't<br>upgrade the infrastructure that we<br>needed to and as a result that's put<br>huge pressure on things like housing and<br>homelessness on our transport networks<br>so we're trying to do that investment<br>now and you can see the big dollars that<br>we're putting in but actually it remains<br>a deficit that we're having to go back<br>over to make sure that we actually<br>do have what we need to meet that demand<br>so look it's a big chart of all the<br>things we said we were doing in the<br>budget as i said earlier for me<br>it was about balancing those three<br>things getting the fiscal picture back<br>to being more stabilized addressing the<br>cost of living issues that people are<br>feeling right now and getting that plan<br>for an economy that's really going to be<br>sustainable into the future it's always<br>arguable it's always questionable as to<br>whether we got it right but i think we<br>thank you grant so um we've got some<br>prepared questions that were sent in by<br>schools we'll start with a few of those<br>but i'll also ask you to<br>put your hands up if you have some too<br>but let's go with<br>so this came in from wellington girls<br>college<br>how is the government responding to the<br>level of inflation we are experiencing<br>at the moment how are they helping<br>families and individuals with the cost<br>of living crisis<br>so yeah as i um some of this i answered<br>earlier on first thing to remember is<br>that within the system of government<br>there is an entity whose job it is to<br>manage inflation and that's the reserve<br>bank and so from a monetary policy point<br>of view you will see what they're doing<br>right now and in fact they've got their<br>next announcement about this tomorrow so<br>with you know with our system our goal<br>that we set the reserve bank is to have<br>inflation between one and three percent<br>over the what's called the medium term<br>no one ever wants to define exactly what<br>the medium term is but there's a<br>recognition in that there will be times<br>when inflation will<br>peak up above that but over an average<br>period we should expect to see inflation<br>between one and three percent clearly<br>it's much higher than that at the moment<br>it's at seven point three percent most<br>economists would argue that that's the<br>peak that new zealand's going to<br>experience but we'll you know we'll have<br>to see about that but most people can<br>see that it is just in square brackets<br>even though that sounds like a really<br>really big number and it is<br>relative to the rest of the world new<br>zealand still remains in a reasonably<br>fortunate position i was in the uk<br>a couple of weeks ago<br>as mentioned at the commonwealth games<br>but i also popped in to see<br>the governor of the bank of england and<br>it was the day before he announced their<br>latest increase in the official cash<br>rate but he also announced their<br>projection that inflation in the uk will<br>reach 13<br>by the end of the year<br>and you've seen in the us being up<br>around 9<br>across europe similar levels the average<br>in the oecd is just around eight percent<br>so new zealand is kind of in about the<br>middle of the pack on this so still hard<br>still difficult for people who are going<br>and trying to fill up the car or go to<br>the supermarket but relatively it's<br>different and there's something to watch<br>out for which is because the new zealand<br>economy stayed stronger through covert<br>than many others in the world the<br>reserve bank started its what what's<br>called its tightening cycle it's<br>increasing in the official cash rate<br>about one or two quarters before most<br>other countries<br>so round about the end of the year is<br>probably the point at which it'll be<br>legitimate to do some comparisons as to<br>where we are relative to where those<br>other countries are because we're just a<br>bit ahead and so our numbers have looked<br>a bit higher australia's still a bit<br>less than us but the governor of the<br>reserve bank of australia thinks they'll<br>go ahead of where we are now so there's<br>just a bit of a timing thing to think<br>about there so the reserve bank is doing<br>its job it's lifting the official cash<br>rate that's effectively to dampen the<br>economy to see it slow down a little bit<br>so that inflation comes down us from a<br>fiscal policy point of view we're back<br>to the balance question again we need to<br>keep investing but we don't want to pour<br>fuel on the inflation fire and that's<br>one of my arguments for why i wouldn't<br>do across-the-board tax cuts because<br>they're permanent<br>and they often go to people who don't<br>really need it like me uh and therefore<br>that spending actually has the potential<br>to exacerbate inflation arguably any<br>government spending has the potential to<br>do that but if it's least if it's<br>targeted and it's temporary you've got a<br>better chance of it not exacerbating<br>inflation on the other side of the coin<br>we still have to help people through it<br>and so you saw the big list of things<br>that we did this might preempt i think<br>the next question jane<br>but one of one of the things i wanted to<br>say is<br>the cost of living payment that you're<br>hearing about now is not the only thing<br>we've done and in fact it was an add-on<br>to what we did on the 1st of april so on<br>the 1st of april we lifted all main<br>income benefits superannuation student<br>allowances the family tax credit and<br>child care allowances we've lifted all<br>of those for people who are on the<br>lowest incomes in new zealand<br>what we then recognised having done that<br>was that there was another group of new<br>zealanders<br>those who earned up to 70 000 who<br>weren't eligible for any of those things<br>who were also really struggling and so<br>it's what we did with the cost living<br>payment was add in a group of people we<br>didn't make those people who had got the<br>lift on the 1st of april eligible<br>because they were already being<br>supported so that i know is cause some<br>people say well why why have you not<br>given the cost of living payment to<br>people on the lowest incomes we've<br>actually already given money to those<br>people so you've seen what we're trying<br>to do and the only other point i'd make<br>is if you it's not just about giving<br>more income support it's also going to<br>be about addressing uh those underlying<br>causes like the price of food and the<br>thanks grant i think you have partially<br>answered the next question which was<br>from tyree college<br>but i'm not the first one not the first<br>one yeah so i as i said i did the second<br>one i've explained the first one is<br>around why some year 13 students are<br>getting the cost of allowance and others<br>aren't there's an age limit as you'll<br>all know i know the person who's asked<br>the question knows that as well and so<br>we set the age limit at 18. in the end<br>that's about needing to create some<br>consistency in the system if we had no<br>age limit<br>kid children would get it you know<br>because and children who either they're<br>not working in any way at all and so we<br>tried to find a proxy for working age<br>and 18 was what we chose for that there<br>are always going to be anomalies in that<br>the people who are 16 or 17 might be<br>working but you've got to find a way of<br>measuring it also our judgment is that<br>most people aged 16 and 17 are likely to<br>be living at home and so they're likely<br>to be supported by their family and<br>their parents some of whom would be<br>getting the payment as well but i<br>recognize um and the issue particularly<br>we had was for people who had left home<br>who were still 17<br>and<br>at university for example it was a bit<br>of a challenge but by august 1 which was<br>the first date most people have turned<br>18. and so the number was relatively<br>small but i do recognize there was<br>always an exception<br>but we have to set the line somewhere<br>otherwise it would be an open payment to<br>everybody and and a that wouldn't be<br>affordable and b i don't think it'd be<br>okay we'll go to another prepared<br>question and then i'll open to the floor<br>so get your thinking caps on<br>um<br>actually you've partially<br>answered this one too but it's this one<br>came from wellington east girls college<br>what is the government going to do in<br>the next year to decrease inflation and<br>what will the consequence on<br>unemployment and gdp<br>maybe just ahead for the last part of<br>the question so the forecast is for<br>unemployment to rise<br>it is at the moment at 3.3 percent um<br>there's a lot of people who believe that<br>that's below where so we we ask the<br>reserve bank as well as to look at<br>inflation we ask them to look at what we<br>call maximum sustainable employment they<br>believe that we're beyond that point now<br>that um unemployment around the sort of<br>four that's what the economists will<br>tell you sort of around the four to four<br>point two five percent mark is what<br>people call a naturally occurring rate<br>of unemployment i've got my own views on<br>that but we don't have time for that<br>today but unemployment will rise as the<br>reserve bank puts that pressure on<br>demand going the economy goes down<br>therefore people won't be buying so many<br>things or doing so many things and<br>therefore you'll see unemployment start<br>to rise as i said at the moment<br>it's projected only to rise back to<br>about where it was um pre-covert so<br>about 4.7<br>um<br>unemployment at 3.3<br>is<br>i still think shows that some of the<br>programs we've put in place are working<br>so we've got some people now in the<br>workforce who previously had been<br>regarded as not likely to get a job and<br>we've got some very intensive programs<br>where we work with people who've been<br>long term unemployed to say well why is<br>that and what are the things we can help<br>you train so you might hear about a<br>program called mana in mahi which is<br>designed to get people who are<br>struggling to find work or who've been<br>on the benefit for a long time and<br>intensively work with them on how we can<br>get them into a job what are the skills<br>that they need to match up with<br>with the demands that are out there in<br>terms of gdp as i mentioned before<br>everybody is forecasting for gdp to be<br>significantly moderated over this year i<br>think i saw anz this morning saying 1.8<br>or 1.7 for the year um that's much lower<br>than what we've seen in recent times but<br>again the curve will see that come back<br>up<br>as we get through this really difficult<br>period<br>okay is there anyone that<br>that has a question and we've got a<br>microphone that we can bring over to you<br>so put your hand up if you do have a<br>question<br>anyone willing to be brave right we'll<br>have one over here if you could say your<br>uh kia ora my name is mairie wiki i'm<br>from newlands college and my question is<br>in regards to te matatani's budget<br>after receiving a 1 million annual<br>increase te matatini will now see 2.9<br>million per year comparing these to the<br>funding given to the royal new zealand<br>ballet which will receive 8.1 million<br>per year and the symphony orchestra<br>which will be given<br>19.7 million in tax dollars per year the<br>inequities become very clear<br>why have these pakeha based events being<br>funded significant<br>oh sorry significantly more than maori<br>based events despite zumatatini clearly<br>reaching a higher audience yeah a great<br>question too and um a lot of it is<br>actually just history<br>and you know because the symphony<br>orchestra is actually um<br>a statutory entity so there's like a<br>active parliament the new zealand<br>symphony symphony orchestra act and so<br>the government actually has like legal<br>responsibilities about funding there<br>that's simply because that's how it came<br>to be um similarly with you know<br>organizations like the ballet there was<br>a little bit of a twist there which was<br>the cancellation of a whole lot of their<br>events meant that they got a little bit<br>more money we've been putting more money<br>into matatini over the years and you've<br>just said that as well it's<br>progressively increasing there's also<br>extra money not counted in there for the<br>regional comps so we put money in for<br>the regional comps last year which we've<br>never done before<br>over time i think you're right the<br>iniquity needs to be increased uh<br>reduced sorry and we need to increase<br>the funding that we give mazatini has<br>traditionally had other sources of<br>funding as well but i know that that's<br>been harder for them this time around<br>and i would expect over over the next<br>few budgets you would see that in equity<br>reduced a lot of what happens in the<br>budget is based on history in this case<br>it's an inequitable history but you know<br>like you have funding and then you you<br>know you keep doing it and then<br>introducing something new<br>into the budget is actually quite hard<br>but we have tried to do that with<br>matatini and um yeah i'm confident<br>you'll see more in the future<br>um do you have any plans of increasing<br>the budget yeah and look there's we have<br>like so that's the first thing as you've<br>noted we have increased it and yeah look<br>you know it'll be definitely on the<br>hi my name's hannah um and if you see<br>that employment the employment rate is<br>such a problem um but there's a labor<br>shortage it kind of doesn't add up<br>if there's such a problem<br>if there's an unemployment problem<br>problem but we also have a labor<br>shortage why is that still a thing yeah<br>yeah so it's about as the short answer<br>to the question which is a great one is<br>it's about the mismatch between the<br>skills that um people are unemployed<br>have with the jobs that need to be done<br>and there's always going to be an<br>element of that in the economy<br>i don't think we have an unemployment<br>problem by the way i think we have an<br>extraordinary low level of unemployment<br>that's a good thing but there will<br>always be a little bit of a mismatch<br>between what's needed the labor shortage<br>that's needed<br>there's also people's ability to do jobs<br>is affected by a lot of different things<br>it's affected by what's going on in your<br>life or a health condition or a<br>disability or something like that so you<br>can't always be available at the exact<br>time that a job needs you to be<br>available<br>the other thing is there's always what<br>we call a little bit of tune in the<br>labor market so it's people kind of<br>going from one job to another and<br>there's a period of time in the middle<br>where they're unemployed and they show<br>up in the statistics as as being<br>unemployed<br>but mostly it's about that mismatch<br>between the exact skills that are needed<br>and the skills of those people who are<br>out of work but that's why we spend a<br>lot of time working with people on how<br>we can get them the new skills that they<br>need but that that's essentially what it<br>is<br>i'm alice thompson from wellington girls<br>college<br>i was just wondering over the next few<br>years is there going to be a larger<br>allocation of the budget onto<br>decarbonisation<br>because i know that<br>new zealand is going to be highly<br>affected by rising sea levels and all<br>that<br>absolutely and and<br>i suspect more and more you're going to<br>see<br>well that's already one of the criteria<br>so i mentioned right at the beginning of<br>the four areas and so that's already<br>kind of one of the criteria but as a our<br>goal is a high wage low emissions<br>economy and therefore decarbonisation is<br>critical to that<br>just to maybe dwell for a little bit on<br>the change we made in this budget so we<br>have the emissions trading scheme that's<br>getting money coming in because people<br>are saying well i can't quite keep my<br>emissions down so i buy a credit um<br>we're now taking that money and saying<br>well rather than just putting that into<br>the pot to be used on anything it now is<br>going to be used exclusively on<br>emissions reductions and on adaptation<br>from the next budget which i'll talk<br>about again in a sec and so yeah this<br>budget we had close to three billion<br>dollars of of funding that was that<br>chart that i put up there before that<br>fund keeps<br>increasing because people keep paying<br>into the ets on top of that we'll do<br>more decarbonisation so practical<br>examples<br>transport is the big sector where we<br>think we haven't done as much and we<br>need to do a lot more and so the<br>decarbonisation of our private vehicle<br>fleet you've seen the clean car discount<br>we've now got what's called the vehicle<br>scrappage scheme in there which will<br>support people on more modest incomes<br>who take a car a petrol powered car and<br>get some money back for that if they're<br>moving towards an electric vehicle it's<br>funding in the budget for the<br>decarbonisation of our public transport<br>fleet electric buses yay<br>but also trains and more investment and<br>walking and cycling as well a really<br>important part of this budget and one of<br>the most immediate things we can do is<br>around the decarbonisation of our<br>industry so heaps of our major large<br>industries are still cold running off<br>coal powered plants<br>we have a fund there it's called the<br>getty fund the government investing and<br>decarbonizing industry fund we will go<br>50 50 or 40 60 with a big business to<br>say get out of a cold boiler move to a<br>more sustainable form of energy so yes<br>there's heaps of examples um and that<br>investment both is in this budget and<br>will absolutely continue<br>for me there's a really important<br>element of this which is it's the right<br>thing to do<br>for the reasons that you mentioned and<br>generally for the planet and the pacific<br>region that we live in it also happens<br>to be where some really good jobs lie<br>you know if new zealand's really good at<br>renewable energy<br>you know and one of the things that's in<br>the budget is how do we get more out of<br>our hydrogen economy so new zealand<br>produces most of its electricity from<br>renewable sources green sources if we<br>want to turn that into hydrogen we've<br>got the ability to export that and<br>there's all these jobs around that all<br>the technology the engineering all of<br>that so we can do the right thing<br>and also create those high wage jobs so<br>that's really the core of our economic<br>plan<br>as well um just want to ask questions<br>about the decision-making process that<br>you're engaged in mentioning advice from<br>treasury sometimes i'll see decisions go<br>against that treasury advice cost of<br>living payment i know there was some<br>advice the other way um i think the<br>fee-bait scheme originally had some um<br>the money in the three waters came for<br>councils had some rather no specific<br>points i'm all curious how you decide<br>when to follow that advice or when to go<br>against that what's the process for<br>deciding on that there thanks to the<br>question dominant performance by william<br>gills here too which is good um so<br>yeah<br>there is i wish i could say there was a<br>science to that um there isn't um<br>i would i would listen to<br>or take on board most of the advice i<br>get from the treasury so if you can<br>think about the budget process is a<br>giant process it the budget process for<br>next year for may 2023 has just started<br>so we're in august 2022 so it's a huge<br>process<br>and<br>my my my friends and colleagues um in<br>the cabinet proposed um what was it 60<br>billion or something dollars worth of<br>ideas that they had and we had<br>in about six billion to do that so<br>that's how it starts it's one of those<br>memes you know that's how it starts out<br>finishes like it i have to go through a<br>process of whittling that down and we we<br>do the initial process the treasury's<br>advice to me there is i take really<br>seriously and i largely take it on board<br>at that first sort of triage then as we<br>kind of get nearer to the end of<br>deciding exactly what we will fund we'll<br>be making some judgments where the<br>treasury's<br>views and our views diverge and<br>what i asked the treasury to do in this<br>budget was do three things look at<br>whether or not we were getting value for<br>money for the proposals that were coming<br>up whether or not they were deliverable<br>were they actually ready to go and could<br>they actually be done and whether they<br>were aligned to the government program<br>on those last two on deliverability and<br>alignment that's probably where the<br>difference comes so treasury would<br>sometimes say that that's not quite<br>ready to go<br>and i would say yeah but it's really<br>aligned with what the government wants<br>to do<br>and so i would say even though it's not<br>quite ready perfectly for treasury it's<br>still worth doing and so the process is<br>that as we get towards the end we're<br>shaping up a budget package we're<br>keeping it within the budget allowance<br>that we've got and then a group of<br>ministers come together and make some of<br>the final trade-offs and there's always<br>trade-offs i read an article in online<br>this morning where a particular area of<br>the budget someone was saying that we'd<br>cut funding well we didn't<br>a minister an ambitious minister<br>proposed a really big number and we<br>funded a slightly smaller number we<br>didn't cut the funding we just found<br>what we could fit within there and he it<br>was a he um kind of knew<br>probably that if he if he aimed there he<br>might end up there but but yeah you get<br>the media focus on the bits where we<br>disagree with treasury but actually the<br>vast block of what we do we're actually<br>so we're just about there unless there's<br>a burning question<br>okay we'll just go to the last question<br>that we had in the slides actually yeah<br>i know<br>oh sorry it was that one yeah so this<br>also came from wellington girls college<br>which was<br>lots of questions from william girls uh<br>what in hindsight would you have done<br>differently in managing the economy<br>through the pandemic if anything yeah i<br>mean this is<br>this is the favorite question of the day<br>at the moment i'm getting this a lot um<br>the first thing i'd say is we don't<br>govern in hindsight<br>you govern in the moment that you're in<br>and i i this is like being in question<br>time because i get this question a lot<br>at the moment from the opposition i<br>invite people to kind of put themselves<br>back to where we were in march 2020. so<br>in march 2020 the pandemic had arrived<br>around the world it was already crashing<br>into countries they were shutting down<br>locking down every sector of the economy<br>was in trouble you know<br>and we had to work out at that moment<br>when this had never happened before or<br>not in anyone's living memory<br>what would we do<br>and the reserve bank governor talked<br>about saying he'd rather be too big too<br>soon than too little too late<br>and it's a little bit the same for me<br>i didn't know but what i did know was i<br>wanted new zealanders to keep their jobs<br>i wanted families to be able to look<br>after you know themselves and i wanted<br>to make sure that we got through with as<br>limited loss of life as we possibly<br>could and so the kind of short answer<br>the question jane is at the moment i i<br>stand by what we did it doesn't mean it<br>was perfect though i'm not trying to<br>claim it was perfect i'm just trying to<br>say in the context that we were in<br>i would rather have done what we did<br>and wear that and i guess the simplest<br>way of saying of describing that is that<br>there were no costless decisions<br>so yep what we did cost a lot of money<br>i'd much rather it did that then it cost<br>a lot of lives<br>and<br>ultimately as stark as that sounds<br>that was the moment we had<br>that whether we would go ahead and put<br>the money into the health system lock<br>the country down so that people didn't<br>spread the virus around and pay the<br>economic cost of that<br>to avoid the long-term damage<br>of the loss of life and the economic<br>scarring that would have occurred and so<br>i find that question really hard to<br>answer because i don't want to come off<br>like i think we did it perfectly but i<br>don't think you can answer the question<br>in hindsight because you govern in the<br>moment that you're in<br>and in years to come it'll get written<br>up and people will<br>go into economics classes and write<br>their papers about it and some people<br>will say we got it right and some people<br>say we got it wrong but in the moment<br>that we were in<br>well on behalf of everyone grant um i'd<br>like to thank you very much for your<br>discussion of the budget<br>uh your engagement with the questions<br>your openness um<br>and your hosting of us here in the<br>banquet hall of the beehive which is<br>pretty
