going to look at how<br>to build a bachelor's degree and choose<br>what you will be spending the next few<br>years studying while at waikato<br>for most students the first step is to<br>choose one of the bachelor's degrees<br>that we offer at wakatoa<br>a full list of these can be found on our<br>website<br>alternatively though some students<br>choose the subject that they are<br>interested in studying first and then<br>choose the degree that subject fits<br>within so if that is your preferred<br>method then that is totally okay too<br>a full list of subjects can be found on<br>our website<br>most of our undergraduate degrees at<br>waikato have very flexible degree<br>structures that allow you to take a<br>combination of subjects we offer that<br>are of interest to you<br>here is an example of what a typical<br>degree structure at waikato looks like<br>once you have chosen one of our degrees<br>you must then select one major from the<br>list of subjects that can be studied as<br>part of that degree<br>this will then take the place of all the<br>yellow boxes on the left hand side of<br>the degree structure<br>your major becomes the subject that you<br>specialize in<br>each year students studying full-time<br>take eight papers which are like the<br>subjects you take at school<br>these are split so that you take four<br>papers in the first half of the year or<br>a trimester as we call it and four<br>papers in the second half of the Year B<br>trimester<br>each of these boxes on screen represents<br>one paper that a student would take as<br>part of their degree<br>some degrees like The Bachelor of laws<br>include papers that span the whole year<br>over both A and B trimesters if this is<br>the case and you are taking one year<br>long paper you only end up taking a<br>total of seven papers across the first<br>year to equal the same workload<br>depending on the degree you have chosen<br>that will determine which compulsory<br>papers you must take as these are often<br>specifically chosen to align with the<br>overall degree you are completing<br>the compulsory papers take the place of<br>all the light gray boxes through the<br>middle of the degree structure<br>compulsory papers will consist of<br>foundational skills that help you<br>progress through your degree<br>the dark gray boxes on the right hand<br>side of the degree structure represent<br>elective papers<br>elective papers are free choice papers<br>that allow you to try subjects that can<br>be from any division at the University<br>you can use these papers in a few<br>different ways the first option is for<br>you to leave all eight papers as<br>electives which are the dark gray boxes<br>allowing for the most flexibility each<br>of these papers can then come from<br>different subjects that we offer at the<br>University<br>another option is shown in this example<br>is where four of these papers have been<br>used to achieve a minor which are the<br>black boxes and four are still available<br>to be electives<br>a minor is a subject studied in some<br>depth but not as much as the major<br>subject<br>just like the electives though your<br>minor can be any subject that we offer<br>at the University not just the subjects<br>that come from the area your degree is<br>in<br>for example a student can study a<br>Bachelor of Science majoring in<br>environmental Sciences with a minor in<br>marketing<br>that would mean that you have your main<br>area of environmental sciences that is<br>the area you are an expert in with the<br>addition of some marketing knowledge<br>the final option for your elective<br>papers is to use all eight of them to<br>create a second major as shown in this<br>example<br>a double major is where you study one<br>degree but focus on two different<br>subjects in depth within that degree<br>just like the electives or minor your<br>second major can come from any subject<br>that we offer at the University<br>a double major doesn't take any longer<br>to complete than a standard degree and<br>it doesn't end up costing any more it<br>just means that we are more specific<br>with the papers we get you to take as<br>part of your degree to make sure that<br>you end up specializing in the two<br>subjects you have chosen<br>a common example of a degree with a<br>double major that I see is a bachelor of<br>Health Sport and Human Performance<br>degree with a major in human performance<br>science and a second major in psychology<br>it is important to mention that there<br>are some degrees which do not fit this<br>General model<br>these degrees are on screen currently<br>generally the reason that these degrees<br>don't allow for the same level of<br>flexibility is because the<br>qualifications themselves are highly<br>prescribed due to Industry<br>accreditations that they hold which<br>allow you to practice in that career<br>once you have completed the degree<br>in some cases there is a bit of<br>flexibility to allow you to choose some<br>electives but just not the same extent<br>as discussed in the previous examples<br>the University of waikato also offers<br>conjoint degrees which is where you<br>study two undergraduate bachelor's<br>degrees at the same time<br>as you are studying two qualifications<br>this option does take slightly longer<br>than just one degree a conjoint can<br>generally be completed in five years of<br>full-time study but may require students<br>to take some papers over the summer<br>school trimester to complete the degrees<br>in this time frame<br>now that you know about the different<br>ways that you can study degrees here at<br>wakato you can start to work on<br>structuring your own degree for next<br>year<br>when choosing your elective papers and<br>finding out what options we have for<br>papers in each of the subjects we offer<br>you can use the catalog of papers on our<br>website<br>the easiest way to get to the catalog of<br>papers is to use the search bar in the<br>top right hand corner of our home screen<br>once open the paper catalog will allow<br>you to browse papers by their paper code<br>if you know what the paper code is<br>the subject that the paper is offered by<br>or the location that the paper is being<br>offered the locations will either be<br>Hamilton ham Tauranga TGA or online net<br>the other option is for you to use the<br>advanced search to add multiple filters<br>to find what papers are available for<br>you this is particularly handy if you<br>are needing to find the eighth paper to<br>fill a gap and it needs to be an a<br>trimester or the paper needs to be<br>taught from a specific campus papers are<br>coded using five letters for example<br>p-s-y-c-h which reflects the subject<br>that the paper is from they're followed<br>by three numbers for example one zero<br>one<br>the first of the three numbers indicates<br>the year level that the paper is for<br>generally all papers that you will<br>complete in your first year will start<br>with a one<br>the 200 300 and 400 level papers come<br>later in your studies<br>once you have found your paper of<br>interest you can click on the paper code<br>to read a little bit more about what<br>content that paper specifically offers<br>the time that the paper is scheduled for<br>and the paper outline from the current<br>Year's offering<br>each paper will also list any<br>prerequisites that there are for<br>students going into the paper<br>for some first year papers<br>this will require you to achieve a<br>certain level of credits or overall<br>grade in your final year of high school<br>and for some of our second and third<br>year papers this prerequisite may be<br>that you need to take the first year<br>paper before you are allowed to go into<br>the higher level papers<br>it is important to remember that we<br>offer flexibility within our degrees<br>if you decide after Christmas that you<br>want to change your paper options or<br>even your whole degree we can help you<br>with that change and make sure you are<br>enrolling in a degree that you love<br>in fact within the first two weeks of<br>the trimester you are able to change all<br>of your papers if you are not happy<br>our aim is to support you to pursue an<br>area of study that you are passionate<br>about and sometimes it takes trying<br>something new to find out which path is<br>right for you<br>hopefully you are now ready to apply for<br>the degree that you are wanting to study<br>at the University of waikato next
