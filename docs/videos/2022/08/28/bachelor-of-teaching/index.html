for me the presence of tao maori was<br>concrete and present and that was<br>something that i wanted to learn and<br>grow in<br>it also had the arts<br>aspect that i wanted to study and dance<br>and drama and so<br>i wanted to learn how to empower the<br>rangatahi in our<br>in our<br>community wanted to build them up build<br>their mana up but also learn how i can<br>do that best<br>in your first

of our graduates<br>teaching has always been about helping<br>others and i've always been one that's<br>very drawn to kids and just how they<br>interact and learn and<br>all those kinds of things it probably<br>started there that i've always been that<br>kind of child i had an auntie who was<br>my teacher as a child when i was really<br>young and she kind of ignited a little<br>bit of me<br>the great thing that i really really<br>loved about doing teaching at the<br>university of waikiki was that<br>it was<br>a lot of hands-on stuff from the first<br>year studying we were exposed to<br>short um so we did three week practicums<br>then into the second year we had a six<br>week practicum and then into our last<br>year we had eight week practicum so<br>having that progression of exposure to<br>different teachers different year levels<br>and<br>different ways of teaching was really<br>invaluable for my learning<br>journey so typical day<br>i don't think there ever really is a<br>typical day for teachers they're they're<br>never going to be the same there's a lot<br>of different things and like i talked<br>about before i mean the kids their<br>stories come into our classroom so<br>how their start of the day got has gone<br>influences how our classroom is and<br>it's definitely very rewarding job it's<br>one of those ones that<br>you know it's it's the little things<br>that really<br>make you excited about being here um<br>it's<br>it's just seeing that each child can<br>have a little success no matter what it<br>is it's that<br>you know they're all different and that<br>makes it exciting too that they all come<br>to the table with different things<br>different stories and then to be able to<br>add something to their basket in their<br>little lives it's really cool thank you<br>for taking the time to listen and we<br>look forward to seeing you next year at<br>the university of waikato<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
