support that we offer<br>our Pacific students here at the<br>University of waikato<br>sweet so here at the University of<br>waikato we believe that our Pacific<br>stories are full of success we like to<br>remind our students that they come from<br>a long line and Rich Heritage of the<br>greatest voyages in the world we<br>represent the growing the biggest<br>growing demographic young demographic in<br>New Zealand and as such we are needed at<br>decision making tables and we have staff<br>here who are passionate to see our<br>Pacific students succeed within the<br>tertiary space<br>as such we have a you know a few<br>um things that we offer in terms of<br>value added support the first one is the<br>Conch so it is a physical space on<br>campus it's located on level zero of the<br>student center it's open from 9am to<br>about 5 p.m<br>um every day and it's just a space where<br>our students can come we try to keep it<br>stocked with tea coffee there's white<br>boards there for students who need to I<br>guess have their own group studying<br>um situation our student associations<br>and our other community groups usually<br>book The Conch um as well and it's a<br>great space to just I guess go in in<br>between your classes and you know meet<br>your mates and just be proud of your<br>Pacific Heritage really uh our Pacific<br>student associations are key to our<br>student engagement and Student Success<br>we have about 15 and they are either our<br>cultural associations as well as as our<br>academic associations now these are<br>students who are just about a few years<br>ahead of your journey so they'll be able<br>to offer key support tips hacks on how<br>to succeed in that specific paper<br>um that you are taking our immoral<br>learning leader initiative is the first<br>year transition program we really try to<br>give our first years excuse me<br>uh skills additional leadership skills<br>um that'll prepare them for finishing<br>well finishing strong in their tertiary<br>education So within the program we have<br>Legacy seminars where we get our alumni<br>and awesome speakers to come and talk to<br>our students we have Legacy tasks that<br>our students are to do and when they<br>complete all the Legacy tasks they are<br>entitled to a completion pack and this<br>year we're hoping to take everyone out<br>on a field trip<br>um to Tauranga or to Raglan just to a<br>body of water just to tie in that rich<br>voyaging history that we all share as<br>people of the Moana<br>we have scholarships that we offer<br>Pacific students the Pacific Excellence<br>scholarship is about fifteen thousand uh<br>we have Edna money scholarship as well<br>and the top rewards which is offered<br>every year we give out about 20 to 30<br>Tupper Awards each year this is just to<br>recognize that our students are<br>well-rounded are doing well academically<br>and are doing well and serving and<br>contributing to specific communities on<br>and off campus we have aunties uncles<br>and cousins who work in different<br>pockets of the university and what their<br>job is is just to make sure that our<br>students are well supported in their<br>area and if you meet them and they won't<br>be able to I guess help you directly<br>they'll be able to point you to the<br>person that you that that can help you<br>uh we celebrate our Pacific language<br>weeks and Independence days and we also<br>have a presence on social media our um<br>handle on Instagram and Facebook is<br>specifically at White Castle so if you<br>are not following us please do go look<br>us up our social media and give us a<br>follow that's the one most effective<br>ways we communicate to our students are<br>in terms of opportunities and exciting<br>events that are happening around our<br>communities<br>we also have key contexts and<br>relationships for those off-campus so<br>our Secondary School teachers will be<br>able to let us know the changing needs<br>of you know our Pacific students that<br>are coming in we have um counter and<br>since who help out in things like<br>license they also provide additional<br>career advice during covert they were a<br>great source of support for our students<br>in terms of financial help and other<br>help as well we would like to work well<br>with our key I guess stakeholders they<br>also have a passion to see a Pacific<br>shouldn't succeed and we believe that if<br>we are in good relationship with the<br>stakeholders we can give the most to our<br>students<br>so that is the image I think from Temple<br>was about two years ago so you can see<br>that there is a range of students that<br>we have we have parents we have siblings<br>we have um those who started out in our<br>Foundation program or cup program and<br>that are now succeeding now these<br>students come from a different<br>background but different backgrounds but<br>one thing that remains is their passion<br>to see themselves contribute<br>um to the Pacific communities in their<br>area of study and our passion to make<br>sure that you know they do Finish Well<br>they do finish strong and they do finish<br>with so much more to give so if
