your application<br>if you want to know more about<br>scholarships get in touch with the<br>scholarships team we are here to answer<br>any questions you have<br>i'd now like to introduce robbie marris<br>a current student here at the university<br>of waikoto to tell you more about his<br>experience with scholarships<br>everyone my name is robbie i'm currently<br>a master's student studying economics<br>here at the university of waikato<br>i recently finished a bachelor of<br>business here at the university majoring<br>in economics and chemistry and i've had<br>a fantastic time here at waikato<br>i've had the opportunity to be a tutor<br>and a research assistant and i'm also<br>the student representative on the<br>scholarships committee<br>outside of my studies i'm an avid<br>football referee in hamilton's active<br>sports community<br>and today i have the pleasure of talking<br>to you all about scholarships here at<br>the university of waikato<br>firstly echoing what shea has discussed<br>there is a huge amount of money<br>available for students in the form of<br>scholarships and bursaries and there are<br>scholarships for all types of students<br>in fact the university of waikato alone<br>offers over 11 million dollars worth of<br>scholarships to students<br>and whether you're an international<br>student school leaver current student or<br>postgraduate student there is something<br>for everyone<br>there's also a common belief that<br>scholarships are only available to new<br>and incoming students<br>however that is most definitely a myth<br>as there are a range of scholarships to<br>support students once they arrive here<br>at the university<br>and as shea showed earlier there is a<br>super easy and user-friendly<br>scholarships finder that can help you<br>identify what you are eligible to apply<br>for<br>whilst i've been studying at the<br>university of waikato i've been<br>fortunate enough to receive a few<br>scholarships including the te paiwai<br>oterangi scholarship for academic<br>outstanding academic achievement the<br>summer research scholarships in 2019 and<br>20<br>and a brian perry charitable trust<br>management scholarship<br>and those last two scholarships were<br>received while i was studying<br>highlighting some of the scholarships<br>that are available to students once they<br>arrive here at the university of waikato<br>i've applied for many other scholarships<br>and been unsuccessful however it's<br>important to keep applying for other<br>scholarships as you never know when you<br>might be successful<br>i've also found that scholarships<br>deliver many benefits beyond financial<br>support<br>they have enabled me to focus on my<br>studies and extracurricular activities<br>meet like-minded individuals build<br>networks make friends and it serves as a<br>signal to of my abilities to future<br>employers and scholarship boards<br>and once you've applied for one<br>scholarship the process becomes much<br>easier and quicker<br>for me it's a no-brainer to apply for<br>everything you think you're eligible for<br>one of the many benefits of attending<br>wirecuttle and applying for scholarships<br>is the high degree of flexibility and<br>sustained support that the university<br>offers<br>many scholarships are accommodating and<br>fixable to your current circumstances<br>for instance during the covert 19<br>lockdowns in new zealand the university<br>issued extensions and waivers for<br>various aspects of particular<br>scholarships<br>for some scholarships the university<br>also offers you some choice in how you<br>use the funds for example towards living<br>costs or staying in the halls of<br>residence<br>the scholarships team are always<br>improving and refining their<br>scholarships offerings and looking to be<br>at the forefront of new zealand<br>universities<br>i'd also say that in general not just<br>around scholarships the university of<br>waikato is an extremely accommodating<br>university relative to other new zealand<br>institutions<br>i changed degrees several times and was<br>still able to finish on time with the<br>support of the university<br>i was also able to study a business and<br>science major within the same degree<br>which was pretty cool and it's something<br>other universities often don't allow for<br>one more pearl that i'd like to add is<br>that i would highly recommend taking<br>advantage of the extremely knowledgeable<br>and friendly scholarships team<br>they can answer any questions on waikato<br>scholarships and on scholarships offered<br>by external organizations<br>because on top of the range of<br>scholarships waikato offers waikato<br>students are also eligible to apply for<br>many generous external scholarships<br>and the fantastic scholarships team are<br>well placed to help you apply for these<br>and they have a network of previous<br>scholars that they can put you in touch<br>with<br>there are also links to external<br>scholarships on the university of<br>waikato's online scholarships finder<br>the university and the scholarships team<br>want to see you succeed and help you<br>reach your goals take advantage of that<br>and make the most of the help that is<br>available to you<br>overall there are a wide range of<br>scholarships on offer to all students<br>there is a scholarship for everyone and<br>the benefits of receiving a scholarship<br>are huge<br>i'd recommend applying for as many as<br>you can and using the scholarships<br>finder to
