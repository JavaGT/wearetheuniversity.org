foreign<br>affairs for 15 years five of those in<br>the legal division and recently in the<br>general international law team which<br>essentially is everything other than<br>trade law environment resources but with<br>particular focus on security issues<br>she was posted to the new zealand high<br>commission in canada<br>and had roles in the ministries trade<br>negotiations southeast asia and pacific<br>regional teams and she was also new<br>zealand's lead negotiator for the trade<br>and services agreement and lead council<br>for the comprehensive and progressive<br>agreement for the trans-pacific<br>partnership not tv um so<br>on that note i shall welcome sarah up<br>here please thank you very much it's um<br>wonderful to be here um it's my first<br>time at waikato university and it's i<br>think our very first phoebe local event<br>normally as you know the ministry tends<br>to hold one in wellington but it's<br>really wonderful to be able to come out<br>and visit your house as well today<br>so today um<br>i'm going to focus on two areas<br>part of the bb is to talk about<br>things that you've been working on and<br>two areas that we've been working on in<br>the general international law space<br>relate that relate to uh<br>russia's invasion of ukraine so first<br>thing i'm going to talk about is<br>sanctions<br>um and the second thing i'm going to<br>talk about is the ukraine mission<br>federation case for the ic the<br>so russia's<br>issue i'll just take my mark<br>russia's aggression against uk ukraine<br>poses the biggest challenge to the<br>current rules-based international order<br>um<br>we think since the charter was um<br>established in 1945<br>having a permanent member of the<br>security council pursue an illegal war<br>of aggression in the face of widespread<br>international contemplation poses a<br>fundamental challenge to the<br>effectiveness and legitimacy of the<br>united nations and its institutions<br>if left unchecked russia's actions could<br>cause lasting damage to the foundational<br>rules<br>of peace and security and that is why<br>new zealand<br>considered it was really important for<br>us to act<br>as the prime minister has said<br>russia's actions are an affront to all<br>of us<br>not because this conflict should be<br>characterized as a war of the west<br>versus russia or even democracy versus<br>autopsy<br>it is neither<br>rather it is a war of russia versus all<br>those who behold a basic sense of<br>humanity and choose to act on it<br>so the first thing i'm going to talk<br>about is sanctions uh and i'm starting<br>there because<br>one of the things that happened to me<br>this year is<br>we essentially<br>had to develop<br>essentially a new government function in<br>relation to sanctions for russia and one<br>of my roles was<br>being<br>transitioned into what we call the<br>russia sanctions task force which is an<br>interagency task force that manages that<br>process<br>so as many of you know<br>sanctions<br>are basically coercive measures that can<br>be applied to diplomatic economic and<br>cultural relations between states<br>the purpose is to<br>encourage or incentivize<br>sorry condem or encourage or incentivize<br>a change in behavior<br>now prior to the russia sanctions act<br>which was passed under urgency in<br>parliament in march this year<br>the new zealand government only had the<br>power to impose sanctions under the<br>united nations act 1946<br>and it could only do that if they were<br>authorized by the united nations<br>security council<br>and to be honest that remains the<br>government's preference we prefer to act<br>um consistently with um rules decided at<br>the international level<br>um and we also think that sanctions work<br>best when they are undertaken by the<br>broadest possible range of countries and<br>of course having the u.n security<br>council in all states<br>being required to comply with the<br>directions of the u.n security council<br>ensures that happens<br>but because russia as we all know is a<br>permanent member of the united nations<br>security council<br>it is able to veto u.n security action<br>in this case<br>so that left us with a little bit of a<br>quandary<br>what do we do<br>it doesn't mean new zealand couldn't do<br>anything<br>we can and we did for example expand our<br>export controls with respect to russian<br>galleries so one of the first things we<br>did was issue a gazette notice which<br>prevented um exports going to the<br>russian military and security<br>organizations um so that<br>companies exporting from new zealand<br>weren't inadvertently supporting the<br>russian war effort<br>um we also could do things like travel<br>ban so we could um prevent president<br>putin for example and um members of uh<br>the<br>uh russian federation um coming here<br>um but stopping there would have put new<br>zealand out of step with our<br>international partners<br>and meant that we could have become a<br>safe haven for those sanctions<br>so sanctioned by other countries to hide<br>their assets<br>this was not acceptable to them to the<br>government<br>but it did present a challenge for<br>officials an urgent response was<br>necessary<br>in part because of the urgency but also<br>because an autonomous a fully autonomous<br>sanctions regime would have been a<br>significant step for new zealand<br>involving a wide range of policy<br>considerations<br>it was decided to take forward what we<br>call a bespoke approach<br>so the russia sanctions act is limited<br>to russia's actions and this conflict<br>and countries that are essentially<br>complicit<br>in those actions and so far<br>belarus is the only other country that<br>new zealand has sanctioned under the<br>russia sanctions act<br>uh the russia sanctions act also allows<br>us to sanction individuals<br>and they don't necessarily have to be<br>russian um but people with essentially<br>was influenced<br>adopting the act<br>also meant that<br>parliament not just the executive branch<br>has taken the decisions that sanctions<br>against russia are warranted in this<br>context<br>but the act itself is a framework<br>regulations under the act are where<br>sanctions are actually<br>enacted<br>and they also had to be done with<br>urgency<br>sanctions aren't straightforward uh<br>while they are essentially a foreign<br>policy tool<br>um<br>they touch on a wide range of policy<br>areas that are led by a wide range of<br>government agencies<br>so we have this interagency task force<br>that brings in financial regulators<br>transport agencies customs immigration<br>police<br>so that we can<br>design and implement sanctions<br>our regulations currently include asset<br>freezes<br>goods and goods important export<br>prohibitions and restrictions<br>prohibitions on dealing with services<br>and prohibitions on certain aircraft and<br>vessels entering into new zealand so um<br>oligarchs is the obvious one um that<br>you've heard a lot about in the media<br>and there's the<br>ship in fiji that has since been taken<br>to hawaii by the americans<br>with a faberge egg on it i mean<br>this is a personal side who carries a<br>feminist on a yacht i don't know but<br>someone clearly does<br>um the tis<br>the test in the russia sanctions act for<br>making a sanction<br>was deliberately flexible to allow for<br>action to be taken quickly<br>um<br>so you will see in the test and section<br>8 of the act says<br>complementarity with other countries<br>sanctions<br>condemnation against russia so it's<br>quite a flexible test<br>um<br>and that was deliberate<br>but<br>one of the things we've had to learn how<br>to do which we haven't done before even<br>though we have you in sanctions on the<br>books is that we are now responsible for<br>taking decisions about who to sanction<br>why<br>what sanctions apply<br>so we've had to build appropriate<br>processes around those<br>functions<br>we've also had to consider how sanctions<br>are to be complied with and enforce so<br>there's a<br>whole range of things to do there<br>like ensuring that businesses are aware<br>of the sanctions and how they might<br>some of our sections are quite broad<br>partly that's a function of them having<br>to be done quite quickly and partly a<br>function of the fact that new zealand<br>has relatively limited exposure um to<br>the russian economy interruptions<br>generally but we do have exceptions in<br>our regulations that allow particular<br>activities to continue<br>so since early march we've sanctioned<br>about<br>800 individuals and entities<br>including most russian banks and<br>financial entities<br>um and will be continuing to<br>announce further sanctions over the<br>coming months<br>um so there's lots of information on our<br>website if you are interested in that i<br>know it's more of a foreign policy issue<br>perhaps an illegal one but it certainly<br>required<br>a lot of<br>legal thought into the construction of<br>sanctions and how they are implemented<br>so the second issue that i was going to<br>talk about today was the international<br>court of justice case<br>um many of you will be familiar with<br>this already but i'm going to<br>just run through it quite quickly<br>um so as you'll be aware<br>as part of its<br>justification for its special military<br>operation<br>um<br>russia claimed that genocide had been<br>occurring in the luhansk and annexed<br>we believe that<br>perhaps inadvertently but it certainly<br>exposed russia to legal challenge<br>because it provided a hook<br>for ukraine to take russia to the<br>international court of justice under the<br>dispute settlements of the genocide<br>convention<br>and the reason for that is because<br>unlike in many cases both russia and<br>ukraine are parties to the genocide<br>convention and neither took a<br>reservation under article 9 of the<br>convention which um is the dispute<br>settlement provision so it meant that<br>russia had essentially consented to the<br>jurisdiction of the icj<br>um so article 9 of the convention says<br>the icj has jurisdiction over disputes<br>relating to the interpretation<br>application or fulfillment of the<br>convention<br>ukraine filed the case on 27 february so<br>three days after the invasion<br>arguing that his dispute had arisen as<br>ukraine and youth russia had opposite<br>views on whether genocide had in fact<br>been committed in ukraine and therefore<br>whether article 1 of the convention<br>provided a basis for russia to use<br>military force against ukraine to<br>prevent and punish this alleged genocide<br>russia did not take part in the first<br>court hearing in march but in a document<br>presented to the court it argued that<br>the icg had no jurisdiction because the<br>genocide convention governs neither the<br>use of force between states<br>nor the recognition of states so<br>recognition was an issue because of<br>course russia claims that<br>um<br>lou has contacts uh in you know<br>essentially independent republics and<br>that's the way that recognition becomes<br>part of this case<br>um<br>so russia didn't take part in that in a<br>court hearing it said<br>genocide doesn't talk about the use of<br>force between its days it doesn't talk<br>about the recognition between states and<br>in any case its special military<br>operation was not based on intervention<br>under the genocide convention but on<br>article 51 of the un charter so that's<br>exercising the right of self-defense in<br>the event of an arm detect<br>and customer international law<br>in its provisional measures order of 16<br>march<br>the icj accepted as plausible<br>ukraine's argument that it had a right<br>under the genocide convention not to be<br>subjected to a false claim of genocide<br>which is then used as a basis for using<br>force against it<br>importantly<br>because the court accepted that the<br>scope of the case included russia's<br>military response<br>the icj may be able to make binding<br>rulings on russia<br>a clear ruling on the illegality of<br>russia's actions and the potential to<br>require russia to pay financial<br>reparations to ukraine<br>might provide a road map and benchmarks<br>for rush to rejoin the international<br>community in the future but of course<br>nothing about that is<br>certain<br>as a party to the genocide convention<br>and a strong defender of the<br>international rules-based system<br>new zealand has a real interest in<br>ensuring that genocide convention is<br>properly interpreted and applied<br>for this reason on 30 june the minister<br>of foreign affairs and the attorney<br>general jointly announced that new<br>zealand would formally intervene as the<br>third part as a third party in this case<br>pursuant to article 63 of the<br>international court of justice statute<br>this is a pretty big deal new zealand<br>has intervened in an icj case only once<br>four which some of you will remember was<br>australia's 2012 case against japanese<br>whaling in the southern ocean<br>ukraine has now filed its full case on<br>the merits and on friday last week<br>latvia announced that it also filed the<br>first third-party intervention in<br>ukraine's case<br>we are expecting a significant number of<br>third-party interventions to be filed in<br>the coming weeks including our own<br>so what will our<br>intervention say<br>a third party intervention under<br>article 63 of the icj statute<br>means that the intervention must be<br>combined to strict legal interpretation<br>of the genocide convention<br>we're yet to file our declaration so i<br>can't go into too much detail but what i<br>can say is that our intervention will be<br>a high-level summary covering the key<br>points<br>um with a focus on the scope of both<br>article 1 and article 9 of the genocide<br>convention and an overarching obligation<br>to interpret the genocide convention as<br>a whole reasonably and in good faith<br>new zealand has particular interests in<br>the good faith application and<br>interpretation of legal obligations<br>respect for multilateral arrangements<br>and institutions including an effective<br>and<br>an effective urine system and effective<br>finding international dispute settlement<br>and i will leave it there um i'm very<br>aware that um al gillespie isn't here<br>today um and i know he wanted to have a<br>good discussion um so we talked about um<br>enabling that to happen um but uh i'm<br>hoping he's not here today but very well<br>happy to take care of these students<br>great thank you ever so much<br>what i will do<br>i should hear me so what i will do is i<br>will um<br>see if anyone has any questions i know i<br>certainly scribbled down a couple as<br>well that always really piqued my<br>interest<br>so if there's anyone um in this room or<br>if anyone wants to put something on chat<br>in the meantime<br>perhaps<br>very interesting presentation and i<br>i have a couple of questions on on small<br>sanctions and the other one on the icga<br>case and consumption is<br>what many countries are considering<br>using the frozen assets<br>compensate<br>to be used to be used for the purpose of<br>compensation of<br>ukrainian losses and<br>is new zealand uh<br>has new zealand considered<br>to join this type of approach or<br>what is what is uh<br>if you can obviously answer this kind of<br>question yeah i mean i mean i could we<br>can sort of see the uh attractiveness<br>well i think individuals can see the<br>attractiveness of the idea<br>you know ill-gotten games essentially<br>being used to<br>fund ukraine's reconstruction<br>when the russia sanctions act was<br>developed obviously it was owned quickly<br>and under urgency and the concept of<br>seizure<br>isn't one that's included in the act<br>so it would require us to do something<br>else<br>um so<br>while for example under the customs and<br>excise act 2018<br>if you breach customs rules which could<br>include exporting something in a breach<br>of the sanction there is a sort of<br>seizure there there's nothing in<br>particular under the russia sections act<br>thank you so much and the second<br>question well sir no no go for it and<br>then we'll come to the geshery and then<br>dara yes<br>and the second question is<br>so there are some countries uh canada<br>for instance helping with the<br>investigation before before the<br>international criminal<br>court<br>is new zealand involved in this helping<br>this process too<br>um well what we have done is provide and<br>i'll just get the figure for you<br>we've put money into the international<br>court investigation i think uh 1.3<br>million dollars so we are providing<br>monetary support to that but<br>no other support<br>um you provided somebody uh new<br>information to me sarah so thank you uh<br>i found it really interesting uh you<br>mentioned it to me it's very rare that<br>we filed for third party interest in<br>such proceedings<br>with the ic<br>i'm just wondering what was the process<br>that was followed for new zealand coming<br>to the decision that we are going to<br>go ahead and<br>file for a third party interest in this<br>case<br>um<br>i think the actions of russia<br>we basically want to support<br>the international rules-based system<br>so<br>supporting the<br>icg icj case by providing our<br>our understanding and interpretation of<br>the genocide convention is something<br>that's important to us<br>um both for the proper functioning of<br>the international system but also<br>because we feel very um<br>i'm not sure<br>i'm not sure what people could um but<br>let me know if um<br>if you missed the end of that and i can<br>repeat it i'm just not sure you want to<br>say it again just in case um i think the<br>question was<br>how did new zealand make the<br>determination to<br>um participate as a third party in the<br>icg case and the response was um well it<br>is a decision for ministers um but<br>factors that were taken into account are<br>you know the egregiousness of russia's<br>actions and using the justification for<br>of genocide to<br>um<br>justify a war of aggression and the also<br>the other important part for us is<br>ensuring the proper functioning of the<br>international laws based system and<br>supporting<br>so is it just people in the executive or<br>or did you get academics<br>or in other experts who informed the<br>decision making um i wasn't part of that<br>myself<br>i i think the decision was made<br>relatively quickly um so i i'm sorry i<br>just can't answer that yeah<br>thank you<br>um dara i believe you had a question<br>yeah i feel like i'm making you jump all<br>over the place really interesting talk<br>um i'm going back to the sanctions<br>and um<br>in the past<br>uh when you look at legislation that's<br>been created as a matter of urgency<br>there are always people who've suffered<br>because of it so is there any sort of<br>judicial<br>arrangement that's set down in that<br>legislation so that if people feel um<br>they've been wronged<br>sanctioned against how can they appeal<br>that is there a process<br>that's a really great question<br>um so<br>there are a couple of different things<br>so there is under section 13 of the act<br>there is a process by which<br>a person can apply and it doesn't have<br>to be the sanctioned person can apply<br>and say<br>i<br>need an exemption because my specific<br>circumstances mean that the sanction is<br>unfair in the way that it operates<br>in relation to me<br>it doesn't say that but essentially you<br>can apply for an exemption<br>and those are the kinds of<br>considerations that might make someone<br>want to apply for the exemption they can<br>also apply for<br>replicate a revocation of the<br>regulations so revocation of the<br>sanctions or an amendment to the<br>sanctions<br>and that process is essentially goes up<br>to the minister of foreign affairs<br>um although she can delegate some of<br>those functions<br>um so that's one process um so you can<br>essentially like a d-listing process you<br>could apply for that<br>another route you could take is a<br>judicial review is to just to say this<br>decision wasn't taken in accordance with<br>with<br>law<br>and yeah thanks<br>thanks trevor<br>thank you<br>thank you guys for the presentations<br>here really excellent<br>two questions first one and i'll<br>get both questions together first one on<br>sanctions<br>was there any any comparative analysis<br>with the atlantic's wealth orders to be<br>used in the united kingdom in terms of<br>formulating new zealand's approach to<br>sanctions question number one<br>question number two<br>crime of aggression which is something<br>that's regulated i understand under the<br>international criminal court<br>and there's been a draft indictment<br>that's been prepared by philip sands in<br>the uk and others<br>is there any appetite for<br>new zealand to prosecute the the russian<br>um i'll take the first one and<br>i think<br>one of when the russian sanctions act<br>was developed<br>it was developed under urgency but it<br>didn't come from nothing so some of you<br>if you've been following the uh issues<br>around autonomous sanctions for a while<br>will be aware that um there was a senate<br>autonomous sanctions bill that was<br>before parliament in 2017.<br>so what uh essentially the russia<br>sanctions act<br>used that framework<br>um which was i think developed in<br>reference to various international um<br>partners frameworks<br>and tailored that<br>for<br>the situation in russia with<br>the russian invasion so you'll see if<br>you compare the two bills you'll see a<br>lot of the same kinds of<br>mechanics<br>but the test is of course different<br>because the test is what<br>relates very specifically to the<br>conflict<br>um<br>so<br>yes and no<br>and then the other part of i think is<br>development of the sanctions themselves<br>which again were developed really<br>quickly and i think that the bill and<br>the initial regulations were passed in<br>just over three weeks from the russian<br>invasion so very very quickly<br>um<br>and again when we're starting completely<br>from scratch there we of course do have<br>um various u.n sanctions on our books um<br>and then our partners that we look to um<br>international partners that we look to<br>for these kinds of issues also have<br>their own autonomous sanctions facing so<br>well i'm not sure if we explicitly<br>looked at<br>the uk orders that you mentioned there<br>were a range of considerations<br>um<br>and appreciating that this all happened<br>very quickly um it um<br>that's also part of it as well so there<br>are um we are<br>um<br>sanctioning new individuals and new<br>entities but we're also constantly<br>reviewing the regulations to make sure<br>they are fit for purpose and work<br>on your second question um<br>i may not be the best person to comment<br>on this my um my understanding is that<br>essentially we are supporting the<br>international criminal court<br>um to<br>investigate<br>um<br>concerns around<br>international crimes occurring in<br>ukraine and that we have um<br>faith in that process<br>thanks for your presentation<br>i've been doing a little bit<br>investigating into this war one of the<br>main reasons for this war according to<br>some top uh academics in the world like<br>rear sharma and even chomsky is the<br>expansion of of nato<br>and<br>i mean even people people like chomsky<br>says that there have been agreements uh<br>for nato not to expand um post um frank<br>of the soviet union so is anyone looking<br>at using international law to see<br>whether this is actually the nato<br>expansion is actually illegal<br>since it's the cause of the war main<br>the truth is i don't know the answer to<br>that question<br>i think<br>that<br>the only<br>person who really knows the cause of<br>this war is perhaps president putin<br>um and um well he's made it very clear<br>yes but um i think<br>it's quite a complex situation<br>um<br>and<br>new zealand's kind of overarching<br>aim here<br>is for that dispute to be settled in a<br>peaceful way<br>and whatever promote i mean we're not<br>going to get<br>into<br>solutions because it's not our place<br>um president zelinski for example has<br>been very clear with um european<br>counterparts when they've suggested<br>you know<br>solutions that it is not for them to<br>make those solutions so what i would say<br>is new zealand<br>supports<br>a diplomatic solution to this conflict<br>that that is our overarching kind of<br>reason for doing what we're doing with<br>sanctions is to try and<br>hi first of all thanks very much for<br>that it's not my subject very and i feel<br>like you've taught me a lot so<br>appreciate it um if i could ask you sort<br>of a future focus question<br>maybe a little bit speculative you um<br>alluded to the problem of russia's<br>permanent status in security council<br>it's it's veto essentially<br>and you've mentioned the russia<br>sanctions act as a as a as a workaround<br>to that and a response to this<br>particular situation but to what extent<br>do you think that<br>as we move forward<br>that the current rules-based system the<br>current structure or architecture of the<br>security council in particular actually<br>well that's a really big question um so<br>new zealand supported un security<br>council for a long time<br>um<br>i guess<br>the issue remains as to<br>on a system that's based on state<br>consent what can you actually do<br>um and i don't know if anyone really has<br>the answer to that question but i think<br>what we did see was a really interesting<br>development<br>um in the u.n general assembly so<br>after russia exercised its veto in<br>relation to this matter theo in general<br>assembly passed that resolution which<br>now requires um or<br>um<br>sorry just i'll get this right so<br>it's<br>within 10 days i think the<br>permanent member<br>is within 10 days of casting its veto<br>the permanent five state is invited to<br>justify its use of the veto before the<br>general assembly so that's quite an<br>interesting development um and it might<br>um<br>you know<br>there might be more of a discussion<br>about these issues going forward given<br>what's happened<br>so we have another question<br>yes i just have two questions on my law<br>told her it's so awesome hearing all<br>this stuff like i feel like this is like<br>heaps of lectures and what i just had a<br>question so<br>um because<br>um canada with that kind of press<br>release for the um<br>the third possible 40 countries possible<br>third party submissions to the icg um<br>is there<br>i have two questions one<br>um is there collaboration between those<br>countries or is it just basically you<br>wait till others comes out then you get<br>to read it<br>so there's a great question and then my<br>second question is<br>um when ukraine has to submit this by<br>september like is there a time frame<br>under the ict procedural rules that the<br>third party submissions have to be<br>submitted by and what is the time frame<br>um<br>so just on the first one i mean it's<br>obviously for each country<br>to determine<br>in accordance with their own particular<br>domestic processes what they will say<br>and that's the same for new zealand<br>but of course we do talk to other<br>partners<br>who share<br>a similar<br>perspective on these issues<br>um and there have been a range of<br>conversations uh with with close<br>partners about<br>about this<br>um on your second question um<br>so my understanding is and i i must<br>admit i don't directly work on that<br>particular issue is that ukraine has<br>already filed its full case on the<br>merits<br>um so you will see<br>actually very shortly quite a number of<br>third party um<br>interventions being filed<br>there's no time frame that you know<br>there will be but i don't have it<br>sorry i'll find it on google somewhere<br>i have a question actually please vote<br>i've got two questions i think i've got<br>two questions i'm just scanning the room<br>to make sure nobody else is waving at me<br>as well or on the screens<br>um so<br>obviously you talked about um sanctions<br>for<br>russia and in new zealand such as russia<br>um are there likely to be any<br>consequences for new zealand as a result<br>of those sanctions and what sort of<br>repercussions might those be<br>sure i mean there's absolutely the<br>possibility of consequences and we've<br>already seen one<br>so<br>the russian federation has sanctioned<br>sorry<br>put a number of new zealand politicians<br>and some senior public servants on the<br>list um<br>and prevent them from entering russia's<br>whole travel man on them<br>um either so that's a kind of<br>uh<br>i'm going for retribution but i don't<br>um a consequence basically of what we<br>have done um the other things that could<br>happen um you know um<br>and has happened to other uh countries<br>struggling for words today and if<br>expelled expelled thank you um excelled<br>then you can get into a tit-for-tat<br>situation and i think some of those<br>european missions in moscow at the<br>moment are fairly light<br>because there's been a sort of a<br>numerical exchange of expulsions of<br>diplomats<br>um<br>were we more exposed in the trade space<br>you could potentially see quite a few<br>repercussions there because we have<br>prohibited some of our exports to russia<br>not food but we have provided basically<br>prohibited<br>goods that support<br>strategic industries and could therefore<br>be used um in the russian war effort um<br>so you could see reprisals in that area<br>we haven't yet um and because um uh you<br>know we only<br>we had a fairly limited trading<br>relationship with russia anyway the<br>consequences<br>even were they to<br>um to take retaliatory trade measures<br>would be relatively small but could<br>affect some particular businesses quite<br>a lot<br>so even when you're talking about all of<br>these sanctions as they might not have<br>overall a huge impact on new zealand<br>businesses but some particular<br>businesses could be<br>severely affected thank you<br>i have one more question and i think<br>probably the oh no dara's got in which<br>case<br>you<br>really interesting i'm finding this<br>really interesting it's not my area of<br>law either um<br>but i'm really keen to know<br>um<br>you know you said that the legislation<br>was passed an emergency and normally<br>what we would do especially when we<br>think about judicial review we would be<br>and you know enabled to go back to<br>hansard or or any of the explanatory<br>notes around when the bill was<br>introduced is there any sort of notes<br>hanging around about your task force how<br>they arrived at the decisions they made<br>were those behind closed loops<br>um okay that's a useful question so um<br>the bill was passed under urgency but<br>they they're of course still the hand<br>side you know first reading second<br>reading um kind of the whole debates<br>that you can go look at go and look at<br>and they are quite interesting<br>um in terms of the development of the<br>regulations i mean normally regulations<br>are<br>developed by the executive branch but<br>you would normally have quite a lot more<br>consultation than as you are able to<br>achieve obviously with stakeholders in<br>such a short space of time so<br>yes there will be um you know public<br>records um that you could you know<br>official information act request um but<br>there isn't the same sort of um<br>transparency yeah well<br>i don't want to say i mean we've done a<br>lot of proactive releases so you can<br>look on our website and um so some of<br>the<br>uh<br>the papers uh have all been proactively<br>released so i encourage you to go over<br>here um for the bits that haven't been<br>proactively released because we are sort<br>of doing getting those done as we go um<br>then you can always request<br>that information yeah thank you very<br>much thank you thank you we do have a<br>question from um somebody in zoom land<br>and uh nalini<br>nalini if you want to take yourself off<br>newt and ask a question thank you<br>uh kiara sarah thanks um for your<br>um<br>i'm not sure exactly how to word this<br>question and there may be only so much<br>you can say on an unclass line but um<br>you you made the point um<br>that<br>uh<br>that there weren't<br>strong trade interdependencies with with<br>russia<br>uh so the consequences of those<br>sanctions uh back on new zealand hasn't<br>been um<br>too high um<br>i just wonder also i guess a<br>forward-looking question if another<br>if another large um<br>player were to um<br>you know somewhere kind of west of here<br>who we do have large<br>trade interdependencies with<br>if if they were to<br>invade<br>another<br>another location<br>um<br>you know would we be so forthcoming um<br>with uh you know with sanctions and the<br>way we've responded um<br>to russia and yeah what has has any<br>um<br>i think<br>i think i'm going to stick to what the<br>prime minister has said on this<br>which is um<br>let's deal with the situation in front<br>of us<br>um what we have here is a situation<br>where<br>a country has<br>illegally invaded another country<br>and the russia sanctions act is a direct<br>response to that<br>um as i said in the beginning whether we<br>should have an autonomous sanctions<br>regime like other countries have there's<br>still an open question<br>which um<br>you know which i can't i am i'm just<br>really not in a position to comment on<br>well i think perhaps on that note we<br>should let sarah take a big deep breath<br>for your wonderful questions<br>and um before we just go to a break<br>because that's what we're about to do i<br>would just like to acknowledge two<br>people that are guests on zoom<br>um in case no one has spotted them so<br>far<br>and that is sir kenneth keith<br>is here on zoom and you are very welcome<br>we're delighted to have you here as well<br>and also jane kelsey as well so thank<br>you both for coming along today and<br>listening to us<br>and um so<br>i think tea and coffee would be a good<br>idea for everybody yes and stretch of<br>legs so we'll say 15 minutes yep and<br>then come back for our next fabulous<br>guests so i will now put this on mute<br>all right welcome back everybody<br>nice break what i'd like to do now is i<br>would like to introduce our next week<br>we're going to have two speakers in the<br>next session unfortunately sarah was on<br>her own well not unfortunately because<br>she was absolutely fabulous but there<br>should have been uh professor al<br>gillespie as well joining her but i<br>thought she um<br>being taken sick so i couldn't make it<br>today which is a real shame but i think<br>sarah did fabulously so our next<br>speakers and the first uh of them<br>joining us in a short while is professor<br>barry barton as so many of you will know<br>my esteemed colleague<br>professor barton<br>supposedly who do not um<br>professor barton is a specialist in<br>energy and natural resources law he is<br>the director of the faculty center for<br>the environmental resources and energy<br>law<br>and has been working on climate change<br>law issues for some time<br>he introduced climate change law as a<br>fourth year paper<br>in the faculty curriculum in 2020 and<br>he's been teaching it ever since and<br>that is a very brief bio<br>professor<br>so without further ado i'd like to<br>thank you julian thank you everyone uh<br>free flyers are good buyers i think so<br>uh but uh thank you for the welcome uh<br>can people hear me okay especially<br>yeah okay thank you amy that's great<br>yeah um<br>what i uh proposed to do is just make a<br>few remarks about sort of the the<br>national<br>setting uh and before moving on to<br>uh the international setting uh again<br>very briefly there are people in the<br>room and online with a great deal more<br>expertise on these matters<br>than i have being a mere domestic<br>municipal<br>national lawyer um<br>first of all you know what is our new<br>zealand context the political context in<br>which we're working uh and and making<br>laws uh it's one of you know quite<br>striking political uh<br>consensus among the political parties<br>and that's been the result of a lot of<br>hard work uh by uh people like you know<br>kennedy graham david parker um<br>and<br>um<br>and of course james shaw uh<br>uh previous uh co-leader of the green<br>party<br>um<br>as an academic i can make what he<br>remarks about the politicians and i i<br>know that your colleagues in the in<br>civil service have to exercise<br>restraints so<br>um<br>we respect that um so a lot of hard work<br>has gone into<br>uh you know a uh<br>this this consensus<br>um and which is quite a quite remarkable<br>you know and it is for example on<br>um<br>you know our position going into the<br>paris agreement our position<br>on uh the zero carbon act<br>the target the the budgets and the plans<br>process that goes through it and the<br>emissions trading scheme the new zealand<br>emissions trading scheme<br>uh but at the same time i i i would see<br>it as a shallow consensus a vulnerable<br>fragile consensus<br>and and you see that in local bodies<br>everyone's prepared to sign on to say<br>that there is a climate emergency<br>but if it comes to taking away one of<br>the<br>road traffic lanes making it into the<br>cycle lane all hell breaks loose<br>you know so we're prepared to to do<br>to talk the big talk at one level when<br>it actually comes to changing behavior<br>it suddenly becomes harder<br>um<br>so uh that that is a complication<br>uh we see it in agriculture too uh those<br>of you who are not climate change are uh<br>nutters uh<br>uh it is about<br>getting on for half of our emissions uh<br>in the form of methane there's an issue<br>there about how you calculate the<br>relationship between methane and carbon<br>monoxide but uh<br>leaving aside huge amounts of money has<br>gone into research<br>um<br>uh we don't need any more of that at<br>some point that sort of funding of<br>research becomes an excuse for not<br>actually taking action and<br>asking for reductions but it's a big<br>feature of our uh<br>emissions profile<br>um it is one we're making progress it's<br>going to be hard work in the next few<br>years<br>and it has possible implications in<br>things like trade for example if we are<br>seeking new trade agreements although<br>you know perhaps we're at a stage where<br>we won't be that many in the next while<br>you know we could expect questions about<br>uh<br>what are we doing about agriculture<br>emissions<br>uh we have uh uh<br>measures<br>coming out<br>slowly for um<br>addressing climate change other than the<br>emissions trading scheme<br>and you know for example we've got the<br>clean car standard and the clean car<br>discount<br>um so those those are emerging but again<br>it's real slow<br>everyone's in favor of the paris<br>agreement in fact even opec is in favor<br>of the paris agreement they said so um<br>but to to to change the way we do things<br>that's proving to be<br>a real challenge<br>you know latest example<br>uh energy efficiency standards for new<br>building in the building code<br>uh it's been postponed only for six<br>months or so but they say it'll be two<br>hundred thousand tons of extra uh<br>uh emissions of co2 equivalent as a<br>result it's a lot<br>um<br>so you know climate change yes yes but<br>there's something very postponable<br>because we've got a crisis in the<br>building industry and so forth<br>that sort of thing is is<br>a persistent problem<br>in energy generally uh<br>you know we still import a lot of fuel<br>we import the greater amount of our fuel<br>in the form of<br>oil<br>um<br>it's priced in u.s dollars so when the<br>the new zealand dollar is not doing so<br>well it's costing us more uh so that<br>continues to be a point of uh<br>vulnerability there's a whole bunch of<br>issues about adaptation to climate<br>change<br>that we you know a lot of whole field of<br>metals that we haven't grasped yet<br>uh you know how seriously do we stop<br>people from building in places where<br>they'll be vulnerable uh two floods<br>river floods<br>uh two fire<br>you know we never used to get forest<br>fires in new zealand just wasn't the<br>thing<br>now it is<br>so<br>you know the the domestic agenda is<br>fairly full there is a sense of urgency<br>that isn't there now but is it enough is<br>it really enough not really<br>yeah<br>right on the international front um you<br>know the the big the landmarks are the<br>paris agreement of 2015 and the the<br>glasgow uh uh climate pact uh late last<br>year and and those were<br>were big important events and it's great<br>that we got people who were actively<br>involved<br>who are going to tell us about<br>personally what i'm quite interested in<br>is<br>um<br>article 6<br>international trading and units so this<br>is where it gets a bit<br>technical um but if uh if new zealand<br>can buy cheap<br>uh units from some other country uh<br>cheaper than we can produce them<br>ourselves uh then why shouldn't we uh<br>the climate doesn't care where the<br>reductions are made it's the argument<br>the new regime is going to be much<br>tougher than we have seen before<br>and new zealand is going to attract<br>particular scrutiny<br>because under kyoto protocol<br>we were guilty of considerable<br>misbehavior<br>in in importing huge numbers of units<br>from uh ukraine<br>belarus and<br>russia that were pretty obviously<br>not consistent with good order good<br>audit practices<br>okay that's a polite way<br>you're probably rubbish<br>so that's a big deal those units won't<br>be cheap<br>but one of the drivers from the national<br>front is that we've got<br>we<br>we need them we are not going to meet<br>our our uh paris agreement uh nationally<br>determined contribution without them<br>uh so that's<br>gonna be expensive i think because<br>they're going to be on pretty high<br>quality<br>under paris also we've got the enhanced<br>transparency framework which is<br>the way of talking about<br>compliance enforcement<br>it's all very delicate and<br>political solutions rather than setting<br>up a new court that can punish countries<br>or anything like that<br>but that will gradually assume a great<br>deal more significance i think<br>from my part as someone teaching in the<br>areas as juliet says uh you know it's<br>going to be interesting to see how that<br>develops<br>another aspect is the pacific side of<br>things<br>and the pacific islands forum<br>uh the case that vanuatu is proposing to<br>take to the icj<br>um<br>uh australia's changed but we need to<br>change too you know we think oh you know<br>we need we've come to talk about china a<br>lot of people in the pacific says well<br>actually we want to talk about climate<br>change<br>and we want to talk about it from an<br>equity point of view you're not doing<br>enough to redress the problems that<br>you've imposed on us<br>we<br>have seen a new set of trade agreements<br>um<br>and new zealand has signed a trade<br>agreement with the united kingdom uh<br>we've got the text of it uh it has a uh<br>a sub article there<br>uh about climate change quite<br>specifically<br>and uh where the parties agree<br>um<br>uh to<br>uh implement<br>the paris agreement<br>it'll be interesting to see where that<br>goes does that mean<br>you know what does it mean to actively<br>uh<br>implement does it mean that ndcs have to<br>be progressively better<br>does it mean that our our nationally<br>determined contributions what we promise<br>you say we will do<br>to<br>reduce emissions<br>um<br>uh does it mean that we can't slip<br>behind international expectations in<br>terms of the ambition of our<br>nationally determined contributions<br>those agreements could be a<br>could be challenging<br>so the europe the one we've uh entered<br>into recently with the european union uh<br>i haven't seen the<br>uh text of that yet but i i suspect it<br>will be uh more demanding and more more<br>complex<br>related to that is is a rather obscure<br>area but one i think will be quite<br>important in the years called broader<br>carbon adjustments<br>or the the<br>europeans call them what sea beams<br>carbon border adjustment mechanisms i<br>think<br>and the way to think about that is that<br>every time you produce a ton of say<br>cement or steel or something<br>you have to you you have to produce vast<br>amounts of carbon dioxide<br>there's sort of no way around it<br>now if if the car if the cement<br>manufacturer is the new zealand one<br>then<br>they are subject to the emissions<br>trading scheme and there is a price on<br>carbon<br>okay if we import from thailand or china<br>there probably isn't<br>so<br>those imports can undercut our domestic<br>production<br>um<br>and put our domestic producers out of<br>business<br>and it's not just a new zealand problem<br>it's an issue everywhere<br>sometimes called carbon leakage so you<br>have very effective policies in new<br>zealand but actually the<br>the emissions continue just somewhere<br>else<br>so how to deal with that what we've been<br>doing up till now<br>um is<br>basically giving out free units<br>industrial allocations under the new<br>zealand emissions trading scheme<br>for<br>emissions intensive trade exposed<br>industries like the cement manufacturers<br>steel manufacturers aluminium smelter<br>etc<br>but that really undercuts the emissions<br>trading scheme<br>and we can't go on like that<br>so uh it's going to be interesting to<br>see as i understand treasury is taking<br>the lead in uh figuring out how we can<br>do one just for cement um which is a<br>sensible place to start anyway those are<br>some of the issues that i see floating<br>around um<br>um and i look forward to hearing<br>hopefully what uh aeron aaron has to say<br>to um take it into<br>that was fabulous thank you so much for<br>that um i've already got questions<br>scribbled down<br>um<br>what i would like to do now is introduce<br>on this our next guest speaker and i<br>have a horrible thing i might have<br>pronounced your name incorrectly<br>aaron jane<br>aaron<br>so um aaron is a legal advisor in the<br>ministry of foreign affairs environment<br>and resources law team and has been<br>there for the last two years<br>and he covers a range of international<br>environmental issues particularly the<br>antarctic treaty system and climate<br>change and prior to this he was on one<br>year's study leave completing a masters<br>in the uk which i believe was oxford<br>and fabulous city<br>and he worked in the ministry's trade<br>policy negotiations divisions on their<br>free trade agreements with the uk and<br>china and he started his career as a<br>litigation lawyer in a large firm in<br>auckland so<br>hello everyone my name is aaron jay and<br>i as i said i'm a legal advisor at the<br>ministry of foreign affairs and trade<br>and i work in the environment resource<br>law unit um on antarctic trade system<br>and climate change issues in particular<br>um it's my pleasure today to be speaking<br>to you about international climate<br>change law for which i have about 10<br>minutes so it's a very large topic to<br>cover in that amount of time i'll do my<br>best so i thought i'd present a few<br>themes for us today on what's happening<br>in the international climate space and<br>then we can have a discussion afterwards<br>i'd also like to thank the university of<br>waikato for hosting this discussion and<br>for very for the initial remarks which<br>in some cases went into more detail than<br>never mind we can go into a discussion<br>later on so first of all since this is<br>an international law colloquium i<br>thought i'd ask a general question what<br>is international climate law<br>so in some ways<br>it's quite a orthodox conception of<br>public international law it's about<br>states coming together and cooperating<br>to achieve um<br>outcomes of mutual interest<br>but in another way it's sort of it's a<br>bit unusual as it asks states to join<br>together out of common concern and to<br>take collective responsibility for a<br>shared problem in spite of nationalist<br>or sovereign interests or at least in<br>theory it does<br>in terms of its content i thought it<br>might be useful to talk about<br>international climate law by reference<br>to the main treaties that it comprises<br>those are as barry said the unfcc the<br>u.n framework convention on climate<br>change and the paris agreement<br>which are two treaties that i work on<br>quite a bit<br>so i'll go through each of those in a<br>little bit of detail and point out some<br>key themes<br>starting with the unfccc the one<br>framework convention on climate change<br>the negotiations for this convention<br>started in 1990<br>and the convention was adopted after<br>about 15 months negotiation in 1992<br>so it shows that we have known about the<br>problem of climate change and have been<br>trying to do something about it in the<br>international space for a very long time<br>much earlier than i previously<br>uh realized<br>so in this convention nearly every<br>country in the world agreed that human<br>activities have substantially increased<br>the<br>greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere<br>and that<br>this will result in the warming of earth<br>just to figure out a few key features of<br>the convention<br>the state of the objective of the<br>convention is to achieve the<br>stabilization of greenhouse gas<br>concentrations in the atmosphere to<br>prevent human-driven interference with<br>the climate system<br>the convention's objective also refers<br>to action being taken within a time<br>frame that ensures one that food<br>production is not threatened and two<br>that enables economic development to<br>proceed sustainably so at the outset we<br>can see that the objective of the<br>convention is tempered somewhat by<br>social and economic considerations<br>another feature is that the convention<br>expects developed countries to take the<br>lead<br>both as the countries that have<br>historically and presently contributed<br>the most to the climate crisis<br>and as the countries that generally have<br>the most resources to do something about<br>the problem<br>in the unf triple c these are referred<br>to as annex one countries because<br>they're<br>literally annexed to the convention and<br>that list includes new zealand<br>and the final sort of feature i wanted<br>to point out was that<br>the unfccc also introduced the language<br>of common but differentiated<br>responsibilities into international<br>climate change law<br>so this reflects that while climate<br>change affects all countries<br>some have contributed more to the<br>problem than others and some are more<br>vulnerable to its effects than others<br>so this is a initial<br>basis in the agreement for climate<br>justice which continues to be a<br>theme throughout the negotiations that<br>i've been a part of<br>but ultimately the unfccc is just that<br>it's a framework it doesn't set<br>substantive goals on parties<br>and instead it establishes a basis on<br>which the world can come together to<br>cooperate to address this issue of<br>climate change<br>and the way that we did that<br>leaving the kyoto protocol aside is the<br>paris agreement which is the next um<br>international piece of climate change<br>law that i wanted to talk about briefly<br>the paris agreement was signed in 2015<br>as barry said<br>um it continued to build on the unfccc's<br>assumption that countries will have<br>common but differentiated<br>responsibilities for this issue but<br>added to that that action will be taken<br>in light of different international<br>circumstances<br>it also importantly added performance<br>measures to the human difficulties<br>objective<br>including the aim to hold the increase<br>in global temperature to 1.5 degrees or<br>sorry to two degrees of celsius above<br>pre-industrial levels and to pursue<br>efforts to hold the temperature increase<br>to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial<br>levels<br>another interesting feature of the paris<br>agreement to point out is that it<br>actually contains very few legally<br>binding obligations it's a legally<br>binding treaty like any other but within<br>it there are very few<br>obligations that bind states to a<br>particular course of action<br>we call those shale obligations because<br>that's the word used and you mentioned<br>to describe those kinds of obligations<br>so there's no obligation for any country<br>to pull its weight in achieving the<br>temperature limitation goals of paris<br>um and nothing happens legally if they<br>don't um<br>the only thing that can happen is<br>political consequences like<br>criticism or<br>naming and shaming if you like<br>one of the few binding obligations that<br>there are in paris is the obligation to<br>maintain an ndc or nationally determined<br>contribution<br>so an ndc is a statement of a country's<br>ambition and the actions that it plans<br>to take to reduce its emissions or to<br>adapt to climate change<br>npcs must under paris be updated every<br>five years paris expects them to<br>represent<br>a succession or greater ambition than<br>the previously<br>prepared one and again paris expects<br>that developed countries will take the<br>lead in undertaking<br>economy-wide emissions reduction<br>activities<br>so in new zealand's case our first ndc<br>was presented in 2016 and updated again<br>in 2021<br>the update from 2021 includes the<br>targets to reduce greenhouse gas<br>emissions to 50 below 2005 levels by<br>2030 and to zero by 2050<br>um so while the paris agreement is a<br>concluded legal agreement legal<br>instrument there are a few outstanding<br>issues that continue to be discussed<br>every time you see in the news that<br>there's a big climate meeting this tends<br>to take up these sorts of issues tend to<br>take up the majority of that discussion<br>so one of these remaining issues is<br>climate finance<br>in other words how much money developed<br>countries should be giving to developing<br>countries to support their<br>sustainable<br>development and also mitigation<br>adaptation activities um<br>given the initial<br>opening that developed countries are<br>expected to take the lead<br>um<br>the developed countries are required<br>actually under paris agreements to<br>um<br>to provide climate finance but there's<br>still plenty of disagreement about<br>how money should be paid to whom and in<br>what context<br>in a similar vein another challenge that<br>comes up time and time again is what we<br>call loss and damage<br>which is just a way of saying<br>compensating vulnerable countries<br>for the effects of extreme weather<br>events that are brought on by climate<br>change<br>again there are similar questions for<br>loss and damage payments<br>about<br>how much is owed where the compensation<br>is needed<br>and also about whether particular<br>extreme weather events can be attributed<br>to climate change at all<br>either way extreme weather events as we<br>know will continue to become more common<br>and more severe as the climate crisis<br>crisis worsens and we've seen plenty of<br>examples of this in the news recently<br>close to home and further afield<br>there are also continued discussions as<br>i said before about climate justice and<br>historical responsibility for climate<br>change<br>um particularly the<br>unique roles within the<br>overarching legal framework of developed<br>and developing countries<br>um they continue to crop up in almost<br>every circumstance that i've seen in<br>these meetings and i doubt whether we'll<br>ever see the end of it<br>and the final<br>continuing and ongoing discussion that i<br>just wanted to flag was<br>sort of the monitoring and<br>measurement of how how we're doing as an<br>international community and our efforts<br>to tackle climate change um there's a<br>there's a new topic raised at the recent<br>bond meetings for the first time called<br>the global stock take um not many topics<br>already but a new<br>discussion that opened about how we<br>measure our success in this forum<br>and it's it's a very technical process<br>that i can't profess to have understood<br>almost at all<br>but it's very complicated<br>so these are some issues that we don't<br>have resolution on but we have been able<br>to make some good progress on others<br>we've agreed guidance standardizing the<br>form and contents of nationally<br>determined contributions<br>and guidance on how parties to the paris<br>agreement can buy and sell carbon<br>credits to one another to increase their<br>climate ambitions which is known as the<br>glasgow rule book<br>but there's a lot more work to do and<br>by no means um done with the conclusion<br>of the paris agreement itself<br>so the egyptian government is hosting<br>the next conference of the parties to<br>these two treaties which is known as cop<br>27 it's the 27th meeting<br>that's being hosted in china sheikh<br>later this year i think it's in november<br>and we certainly hope that we can<br>continue to build progress on these<br>issues at that meeting<br>but as you can imagine just like in any<br>other in many other aspects of<br>international law when every country in<br>the world is sitting down and exchanging<br>views to agree an outcome it can be very<br>so before i conclude i just wanted to<br>mention a couple of other contemporary<br>climate change issues that have come up<br>in the mfat space<br>that you also might have seen mentioned<br>recently<br>the first is an issue that i've been<br>working on lately which is the<br>international efforts to seek an<br>advisory opinion from the international<br>court of justice on climate change<br>then water is leading the charge on this<br>piece of work and it's leaving the<br>charge to build international support<br>for the court to consider the<br>obligations of states to protect the<br>rights of present and future generations<br>from the adverse effects of climate<br>change<br>um some advisory opinion from the court<br>does require a majority vote in favor at<br>the un general assembly the next general<br>assembly meeting is starting in<br>september this year so we expect the<br>issue to make some progress there<br>at the recent pacific islands forum<br>which was held in suva new zealand along<br>with all the other forum countries uh<br>called on the u.n to request the opinion<br>which is particularly relevant as small<br>island developing states which comprise<br>the majority of the pacific will be<br>particularly vulnerable to the effects<br>of climate change and particularly to<br>sea level rise related to climate change<br>but at the same time it's also important<br>to make sure that if a question is posed<br>for international court of justice that<br>it's done so in a way that clarifies<br>states legal obligations that doesn't<br>muddy the waters of the delicate balance<br>struck in the paris agreement<br>and that supports ultimately greater<br>climate ambition<br>and the second sort of contemporary<br>issue that i wanted to mention is one<br>that barriers also mentioned the trade<br>agreements and climate change in that<br>space so yes we have recently concluded<br>two agreements with the uk and with the<br>eu two of the world's largest economies<br>which include<br>some pretty groundbreaking provisions on<br>climate change as far as a trade<br>agreement is concerned at least<br>so in the uk agreement new zealand and<br>the uk reaffirmed our commitments to the<br>paris agreement<br>with us for both parties to it<br>and the temperature limitation goal and<br>have agreed to promote between us trade<br>that supports its objectives<br>we've agreed to take steps to eliminate<br>harmful fossil fuel subsidies which is a<br>first in any trade deal that new zealand<br>has struck<br>and in our trade agreement with the eu<br>each side's paris agreement commitments<br>are now subject to binding dispute<br>resolution in the context of a trade<br>agreement which is the first time<br>we've agreed something like that<br>so the unprecedented forward-leaning<br>nature of these agreements in the trade<br>context and just indicates that<br>international climate law has continued<br>to grow beyond its narrow mandate or<br>sort of its more narrow mandate shall we<br>say<br>so much so that countries now using the<br>issue to define and enhance the<br>relationships between them even in<br>spaces that were traditionally seen as<br>unrelated<br>so that's all i had to say and i'm sure<br>i'm running out of time um and i wanted<br>to open up for a discussion but i want<br>to thank you all for your attention and<br>thank you very much that was fabulous so<br>what i thought we would do as we as we<br>did previously um we'll<br>bare if you want to come back up again<br>in that case so we can have a look at<br>you on the screen as well so i will keep<br>an eye on zoom and also um any questions<br>from the room also you can ask of either<br>or both um i know i've scrubbed some<br>questions down<br>so i will<br>step over here and see if anyone wants<br>to ask any questions anywhere<br>faithful first of all and then alberto<br>and okay and then trevor and then<br>right<br>see you then<br>thank you both so much that was that was<br>fabulous and um<br>right up my street so<br>however many questions were allowed<br>really julia should we just do one for<br>the time being<br>i am jake so okay<br>um<br>you<br>mentioned uh particularly aaron<br>you mentioned the uh the absence of<br>binding legal obligations<br>in<br>um and actually what's left then is is<br>so much relying on<br>political pressure on will on<br>and so i'm wondering with the next cop<br>due<br>in shaman shake at the end of the year<br>um<br>how<br>different<br>an environment are we going to see<br>around cop 27 and what might be the<br>consequences of that compared to<br>some<br>relatively successful protest and<br>well it's it's always a million dollar<br>question i suppose with with cops as how<br>much pressure can we make at each one um<br>i think with the glasgow climate pact<br>for example it was looking until the<br>11th hour like we weren't going to get<br>anywhere on sorry the glasgow climate<br>pact as the<br>the agreement reached that um countries<br>would phase down their coal<br>consumption<br>and it looked like we weren't going to<br>get there until because china and india<br>held off until the very last minute on<br>the phase out language they preferred<br>face down<br>but i suppose if you'd asked me the same<br>question a year ago i wouldn't have been<br>able to tell you whether that would have<br>gone through either um<br>so to be honest it comes down to the the<br>will of the people in the room the<br>mandates they have and it's it's often<br>very hard to know in advance what to<br>expect the kind of issues that i<br>mentioned before lots of damage condom<br>finance are the ones that we will talk<br>about<br>the global stock take is due to take<br>place by the end of next year<br>so there'll be a lot of discussion on<br>that um there wasn't much progress to be<br>honest at bonn<br>in in june this year on that um<br>sorry i feel like i've just gone around<br>in circles instead of answering a<br>question but it kind of is like that and<br>the uns people seem to be perfectly<br>honest<br>thank you very much i think it was our<br>birthday next<br>thank you so much<br>well thanks uh both for<br>great presentations and and i have a<br>question for andrew and and uh so<br>regarding the the icj advisory opinion<br>and what are the ranges what is the<br>range of questions that that<br>the general assembly<br>is considering or the members<br>what kind of option with different<br>options regarding the questions<br>is the general assembly exploring or<br>will eventually explode<br>that's a good question and that's<br>actually the question we have as well um<br>we don't we don't actually know the<br>question the campaign is being led by<br>it's just how the question is ultimately<br>framed to the icj is essential because<br>if it disrupts the delicate balance in<br>the paris agreement then it could be<br>could be counterproductive<br>with the only formulations we've seen of<br>the questions so far are along the lines<br>i read off read off before<br>obligations of states to protect the<br>rights of present and future generations<br>from the adverse effects of climate<br>change but that's not the final question<br>that's just an example that we've seen<br>and actually new zealand's not a part of<br>the<br>discussions for<br>shaping up the final question that's<br>that's being done with a smaller group<br>of pacific island states um but we'll be<br>we'll be watching that closely and<br>making sure that it's<br>it's taking us forward<br>thanks a lot<br>thank you very much<br>oh thanks so much for the speech so my<br>question is about climate finance and<br>100 billion dollar a year<br>from developed country to developing<br>country so my question is about new<br>zealand so how<br>do you think that like in which you in<br>which stage we are in supporting for<br>example especially the pacific<br>region<br>and because if you look to the global<br>level we never in the last six years we<br>never reached to the 100<br>billion euro and also there's a question<br>about for example the funding<br>that<br>are this fund used for renewable energy<br>or not but in terms of new zealand how<br>do you<br>assess<br>financing<br>especially<br>yeah i think you're right and the focus<br>on the pacific is definitely the same<br>one that new zealand as a country has so<br>we do we do a few things in that space<br>we have we have i think it's 1.3 billion<br>we've dedicated to supporting pacific<br>climate resilience and climate<br>development<br>um we also support many pacific island<br>countries to physically attend the<br>cop meetings so that their voices are<br>heard particularly the cook islands and<br>nue and we have particular legal<br>obligations to tokolao<br>um<br>so i think<br>you're right that more needs to be done<br>but as far as<br>what we're doing to support the pacific<br>that's certainly our focus and i think<br>we're definitely devoting plenty of<br>resources to it and i don't know if it's<br>not even plenty a lot of resources to i<br>perhaps the one thing one thing i'd add<br>is that a lot of um<br>discussion within a country like within<br>new zealand<br>uh about something like finance or loss<br>and damage<br>uh this is the fact that to most of the<br>international community the whole thing<br>is a question of equity and fairness and<br>justice<br>you mentioned climate justice and and<br>how<br>heavily that weighs on the minds of<br>most of the people who had these at<br>these meetings um<br>you know there's that great book by kim<br>andy robinson ministry for the future<br>come across that and it's got this<br>classic line where<br>the<br>people facing you know deaths of 20<br>million people in uh india this is<br>fiction but it's you know future fiction<br>uh turn around and look at the westerner<br>and spits out you did this<br>you did this you know and<br>and that's how a lot of people um<br>in many countries see climate they see<br>it as an equity issue<br>decolonization<br>um<br>fairness between states<br>uh accountability responsibility and and<br>that's kind of missing within the<br>national debate isn't it it doesn't come<br>up that much but um<br>people are wondering why do we have to<br>make all these efforts when we're<br>already the most efficient producers of<br>uh v4 or<br>milk powder<br>thank you<br>i believe it's gay next actually<br>yeah<br>my question thank you my question kind<br>of follows on to the equity point i was<br>just wondering with lawson uh damages in<br>the duty to compensate um<br>has<br>well a you know is that firm and b<br>how has loss and damage<br>been<br>defined how broad is it how narrow is it<br>is just catastrophes or is it increased<br>costs or has anybody fleshed out what<br>that<br>what that would<br>what that what that term actually means<br>lots of changes<br>yeah<br>i think i think the answer is no i'm not<br>100 sure about that just given my<br>relatively limited engagement with the<br>with lost damage but i think that's one<br>of the main issues is what does it cover<br>when is it ode um<br>i don't and i don't think we've landed<br>on a definition for it yet either<br>yeah<br>but yeah how are people gonna yeah<br>yeah<br>it's in the paris agreement awesome<br>damage but it's not defined there<br>and<br>different countries have different views<br>depending on how it affects<br>the specific circumstances<br>yeah okay that was my question<br>if anybody had anything besides those<br>there's two<br>a lot of discussion on it to be honest i<br>don't i don't know what the where the<br>current<br>lentil point is but it's it's not going<br>away anytime soon thank you thank you<br>so we've got trevor then sam and then<br>rachel online so over to trevor<br>uh thank you uh<br>two very brilliant presentations thank<br>you thank you very much um<br>i have uh one observation and one<br>question<br>the observation is in relation to how do<br>we monitor how we're doing<br>is the oxford climate tracker<br>which is<br>updated quite regularly<br>it's new zealand and a number of other<br>jurisdictions in the unsatisfactory<br>category<br>where on<br>current policies if<br>they're to be pursued<br>would lead to a four degree warming<br>world and not a 1.5 degree<br>the question relates to<br>the trade agreements<br>and<br>there<br>are we just seeing something that's sort<br>of mirroring what's happening<br>in national<br>uh jurisdictions and debates<br>where i<br>the action is increasingly outside of<br>standard<br>uh climate action instruments no one's<br>litigating climate change law in terms<br>of statutory<br>they're taking judicial review cases<br>they're seeking amendments to the<br>bill of rights for a clean and healthy<br>environment<br>here's the<br>angle that's being pursued now through<br>trade agreements just really a mirror of<br>well on your statement i completely<br>agree um there's many trackers and all<br>of them are not particularly<br>satisfactory even of<br>particularly complementary even if new<br>zealand's updated nbc and we're not<br>alone in that i think most developed<br>countries are still showing<br>unsaid unsatisfactory one shows that<br>it's highly insufficient i think<br>um<br>yeah it's<br>pretty agreeable um<br>and on your question about trade<br>agreements i'm afraid i'm not a trade<br>lawyer so i couldn't probably give a<br>good answer but my my feeling is<br>that where countries are entering into a<br>bilateral free trade agreement and<br>they're putting<br>climate change considerations into it<br>it's because they regard it as an<br>important way of<br>structuring their agreement even in a in<br>a trade space<br>but as far as whether it's<br>along the lines of plant litigation i'm<br>i suppose what i get added is that the<br>consequences are different you know if<br>if uh<br>one<br>party tackles the other<br>uh in the processes<br>and<br>in the conclusion of the of the<br>adjudication is that new zealand can't<br>do what it's done and it has to do<br>better then that will actually be<br>binding on new zealand and parliamentary<br>sovereignty won't get us out of that<br>without essentially disowning the<br>thanks barry<br>thank you<br>so we've got sam and then we've got<br>rachel opie and nalini singh as well<br>thank you nalini i'll come on to you<br>after rachel sam<br>brilliant thanks i'm i'm really<br>interested in your experience working in<br>the antarctic space as well as the<br>climate change space and my question's<br>about a comparison between those two<br>experiences um new zealand's obviously<br>been a real champion of the antarctic<br>treaty and seems to see its role as a<br>real champion<br>of promoting that treaty<br>uh do you think the country<br>pardon me<br>do you think the country sees its role<br>as as similar in the climate change<br>space as being a champion or is it more<br>it's a really good question<br>i suppose the role we have in the<br>antarctic treaty system is<br>more concentrated because there are<br>fewer members i mean the antarctic 3d<br>system antarctic treaty consultative<br>meeting has 54<br>members compared to<br>197 i think it is for the untriple c<br>um and new zealand has a historical<br>claim to a part of antarctica<br>um we have a long history of antarctic<br>science and we're a gateway country to<br>the southern ocean in antarctica so in<br>some ways our position in that forum is<br>magnified compared to the u.n in triple<br>c which is purposefully<br>meant to be about every single country<br>having common but differentiated<br>responsibilities<br>but there's a lot of parallels too<br>because<br>what happens in international climate<br>happens in antarctica more than anywhere<br>else there's 65 meters of of latent sea<br>level rise in if if antarctica were to<br>melt which is completely disastrous and<br>unthinkable<br>so we have to be champions of both it's<br>not about choosing at all<br>thanks<br>thank you<br>and now we come on to rachel opie so<br>rachel over to you<br>yora and thank you very much um thank<br>you both for um the introductions to the<br>work that you're currently and deeply<br>involved in it's extremely interesting<br>um my question<br>might not be and i fully appreciate this<br>um within your areas and so<br>please shout out if that's the case but<br>i'm really interested to know um if you<br>can comment at all on<br>what might be new zealand's position<br>on the evolving international crime of<br>ecocide particularly as it might<br>correspond to any future action um<br>or responses to the lack of action on<br>really sorry i don't know i don't think<br>i can comment on that<br>to be honest<br>all right no that's that's interesting<br>thank you no thanks i just wanted to<br>check whether it might be something<br>that's come across your desk thanks very<br>much<br>barry do you have any thoughts on that<br>well there's a lot of interesting<br>challenging<br>on the front foot uh efforts in legal<br>scholarship to<br>and in advocacy to work out new ways to<br>to do things and and that is one of them<br>so<br>which ones will come home as being being<br>effective<br>uh in bringing about real change i don't<br>i don't know um<br>a lot of the things we take for granted<br>now of course are things that you know<br>before they came in were thought to be<br>crazy stuff so um we have to keep our<br>ears open don't we yeah<br>yeah we certainly do i think i'm i'm i'm<br>happy to see i think it might be<br>progressing beyond the the zone of crazy<br>stuff but like you're right that it's<br>still<br>um in its development but thank you very<br>much<br>thank you rachel<br>hi kiara um this is more of a question<br>for<br>professor um<br>barry barton um<br>you mentioned um<br>the urgency of climate change and um<br>despite a lot of rhetoric there there<br>hadn't been much action<br>one thing i've been thinking about a lot<br>is um<br>the weather that minister mahuta has<br>sort of thrown to us which is what does<br>indigeneity mean in in development<br>assistance and i suppose in particular<br>in climate development assistance<br>and one of the criticisms that um<br>you know are often leveled at uh<br>development work across the board um<br>is the lack of meaningful participation<br>and<br>um<br>partnership<br>and and really building relationships<br>with people on the ground um which takes<br>time<br>and<br>and into our maori and as well as many<br>pacific cultures um you know it's a it's<br>a thousand cups of tea<br>um so how do we balance those two things<br>in terms of going fast um but also you<br>know ensuring that we really are<br>um are upholding both our treaty<br>obligations but as well um really<br>honoring pacific whanau and their mana<br>and agency<br>and um<br>in those relationships in that process<br>um in in this<br>i'm not deflecting it but rob joseph is<br>going to to talk to us shortly about the<br>the way that uh<br>new zealand's uh international<br>positioning<br>has has has changed substantially in<br>relation to<br>the maori dimension of new zealand<br>um<br>there is a lot that uh<br>new zealand generally uh needs to learn<br>from maori about understanding uh the<br>relationship between humans and the<br>environment and and<br>climate change is is one of them<br>absolutely<br>um<br>as i understand it many maori people see<br>the<br>climate justice issues uh affecting or<br>being ones that<br>entail their interests in a substantial<br>way and and you know that's that's very<br>obvious in some circumstances<br>i quite agree that uh about a thousand<br>cups of tea<br>and and a lot of these things aren't<br>going to change without<br>uh<br>work and effort and struggle everywhere<br>what we need to remember is that the<br>international law dimensions are there<br>are only one part of it they're dealing<br>with relations between states<br>and and nobody's involved in that would<br>suggest that that's the end of the day<br>and that you<br>bring it through into international law<br>and institutions<br>uh but that isn't the end either uh and<br>and bringing us through into how people<br>think<br>and and and talk to each other and talk<br>and<br>how do they find ways<br>that they can change<br>um<br>a lot of those things are are absolutely<br>incremental uh you know and there is no<br>sort of giant uh policy measure that can<br>be taken as soon as we do that<br>we're done you know it's it's not like<br>that and climate change perhaps you know<br>one of the differences from antarctica<br>uh is that<br>it in a way especially the way we use<br>energy and the way that we consume food<br>uh it affects every dimension of how we<br>live<br>uh it's not a not a point form problem<br>yeah it pervades everything in terms in<br>terms of our our civilization our<br>economies<br>our way of life that makes it tough<br>thank you barry i just had um<br>bruce burson has just commented and<br>bruce i'm gonna i'm gonna call you in<br>that case i'm just gonna leap in before<br>the others that have put their hands up<br>as well he says that he's a consultant<br>at m and climate mobility<br>and he said there are things that we're<br>doing which relate to nalini's questions<br>so perhaps bruce if i could ask you to<br>speak on this as well thank you<br>well thanks i won't be long um kiara<br>thank you for giving me the opportunity<br>look yeah nalini um absolutely right and<br>it's part of the climate mobility action<br>plan that was announced in 2018 by<br>minister<br>peters uh mfat have been embarking on a<br>number of activities in relation to that<br>and i'm advising on an<br>external basis in relation to that and<br>we've just had a procurement process<br>we're contracting for that to<br>really try and ground<br>um understandings on on what a climate<br>effective future looks like for pacific<br>communities in terms of<br>human agency do they stay do they go if<br>they do decide to go where might that be<br>and part of the function of that is to<br>build from the ground up and using<br>specific methodologies and pacific<br>researchers the truly<br>organic indigenous understanding of the<br>issue to try and drive<br>um<br>more sensitive and nuanced development<br>policy going forward and perhaps in long<br>term might even fit into immigration<br>settings um you can find it all<br>in terms of reference for the project<br>are all publicly available on mfat's<br>website so just something to say that's<br>something that is front and center of<br>the project that i'm involved in um<br>within that um<br>and is trying to do exactly as you say<br>should be done and uh it's quite<br>exciting hope hopefully to be finished<br>contracting and begin to uh<br>have the research underway uh later in<br>the<br>just wanted to jump in there and say<br>that thanks very much<br>thank you very much indeed bruce<br>so we have plus who's going to be asking<br>a question next thank you one of the<br>ideas that i think will be really good<br>for reducing excessive consumption and<br>reducing their impact on the climate is<br>to tax aviation gas<br>apparently uh for international reasons<br>aviation gas is not taxed at all<br>and they would if they did able to tax<br>it<br>there would be an income stream to fund<br>a lot of initiatives in developing<br>countries so has there been any<br>i might be wrong but i don't think<br>aviation has come up much in this in the<br>united triple c paris space i think it's<br>done more in the in iko the<br>international civil aviation<br>organization i'd be wrong about that but<br>i certainly haven't come across it that<br>specific point raised in a big degree i<br>yeah<br>it's um<br>it's it's the international civil<br>aviation organization that has been<br>working on that and there's parallel<br>process uh in in the uh with in relation<br>to international uh shipping<br>so um<br>there is no tax uh and there's no<br>there's no um obligation to surrender<br>new zealand units for aircraft leaving<br>new zealand or arriving there is<br>nationally<br>here new zealand um<br>has to pay<br>to surrender units for domestic travel<br>for the international yes it's out there<br>it's it's one of the wedges you know<br>it's sort of three or four percent of<br>open global emissions uh not<br>insignificant and and there are<br>apprehensions that it being um<br>particulate matter being emitted into<br>the higher levels of the atmosphere as<br>thank you very much<br>so we've got a number of people waiting<br>to ask questions so um i believe i've<br>got this correct if we can go to nathan<br>then emmeline and then alberto and then<br>gay and then i<br>very cognizant of time and i've already<br>had to call the questions to a halt at<br>that particular point so nathan please<br>thank you<br>thanks thank you both um<br>a good question<br>for both of you really you both<br>mentioned the nationally determined<br>contributions um the ndc's what we saw<br>at cop was a raising of the bible by<br>many countries in that respect including<br>new zealand but we've also seen as<br>trevor reminds us that many of those new<br>pledges are still<br>falling far short of the<br>necessary target<br>there was also a lot of discussion at<br>the last cop particularly from african<br>nations around trying to move towards<br>annual redetermination of national<br>of ndc's and to try to sort of ratchet<br>things up are we going to see a<br>more ambitious<br>ndc from new zealand anytime<br>soon or are we going to have to wait for<br>the next five years<br>i'm afraid i work in foreign affairs and<br>what the government does nationally is<br>kind of<br>you're right i mean<br>i think on current projections all of<br>the targets even if they were met to<br>2030 would still see a 2.4 degree<br>temperature increase so it's clear that<br>much more doesn't need to be done across<br>i suppose the existing rules under the<br>paris agreement are that we we are<br>obliged to do it every five years i<br>think we can do it uh<br>more rapidly um<br>uh i like animation governments not<br>wanting to go through that you know from<br>domestic point of view any more times<br>than they have to<br>um<br>uh<br>would it make a difference<br>there would be<br>significant effort required in in what<br>um aaron has mentioned in in the the<br>assessments measuring<br>um and<br>reporting um and<br>those people would probably<br>uh<br>run from rooms screaming about just how<br>finnishly complex<br>that would be<br>thank you<br>emily someone's a very short specific<br>question so in relation to the um<br>climate change response act and its<br>reference to t congratulations<br>consultation with ewi<br>is there someone other than obviously we<br>have the ministry of climate change but<br>who is there a specific role position<br>or someone and in fact that they're like<br>the go-to person in relation<br>to meeting i guess those<br>commitments by the government under that<br>legislation<br>like i was just trying to like do you<br>have someone is there someone an impact<br>who was there that doesn't administer<br>the climate change response act that's<br>administered through the ministry for<br>the environment and that's the domestic<br>facing agency so infants kind of<br>responsible for the international<br>negotiation side of things but the<br>domestic framework is administered by<br>domestic agencies ministry for the<br>environment ministry for primary<br>industries<br>there is a climate change division<br>within mfat<br>that exclusively focuses on our<br>international engagement on climate<br>change issues<br>and within that division there's not a<br>specific role it's just like there were<br>people like that i think bruce was<br>talking from he's in the moon he wrecks<br>the m-fat yeah quite a little bit it's<br>just general people that work in this<br>it's not a specific role but if your<br>question's about the climate change<br>response act then it's not an it's not<br>an impact-driven um piece of legislation<br>or just more of a specific role someone<br>that is with an mfat because you're<br>talking about i think bruce might have<br>an answer yeah there is there's a maori<br>policy unit um and we if you look at the<br>if you look at the um at the terms of<br>reference uh operationalizing the<br>climate mobility action plan you'll see<br>that it's very heavily based on tertiary<br>obligations<br>quite frankly it it is impossible for me<br>to conceive of a situation where we're<br>beginning to have discussions around<br>mobility that don't involve<br>lived experiences of maori people in<br>terms of their own mobility in a<br>post-colonial situation so it's front<br>and center of the work that i do and<br>there's a specific unit i don't think i<br>can give out that person's name uh i<br>there is a multi-policy unit and we've<br>been heavily engaged with it as well as<br>partners at mpp and things of that<br>nature so yes there is<br>thank you thank you very much indeed<br>thank you emily as well so we've got two<br>more questions that i absolutely how<br>we'll have to call it to close<br>unfortunately so alberto and then gay<br>please thank you<br>thank you julie that is a question<br>so how do you think that the<br>war in ukraine<br>will affect the climate change<br>negotiations<br>well we didn't see much um disruption<br>from the war at the recent subsidiary<br>body meetings in june uh there were some<br>strong statements delivered at the start<br>but then we got on with our business and<br>that's exactly what happened at the<br>annual antarctic treaty meeting in in<br>may as well<br>um<br>so i hope we can find a way to<br>to obviously hold russia to account for<br>what it's the terrible things that's<br>done while also not letting our work<br>slip<br>the effects on<br>international flows we've already seen<br>that the european union is<br>agreed not to import as much<br>any russian<br>fossil fuels i just don't know what<br>effects that will have on the global<br>demand for those products but as far as<br>the negotiations go so far we've managed<br>thank you<br>the invasion's sending huge ripples<br>through energy markets and and through<br>european<br>uh climate and energy policy<br>yeah<br>they need to go on about it but uh<br>and they pulled different directions you<br>know from a european power company's<br>point of view it is oh we'll keep the<br>coal plants open for another few years<br>but at the same time it is well<br>shouldn't we be focusing more on energy<br>efficiency measures<br>so uh you know it's it's real turmoil<br>world oil prices are high<br>um<br>russia can still manage to sell its oil<br>at discounted prices they're doing quite<br>well out of it<br>but it's it's uh<br>it's a lot going on yeah<br>not all of it very satisfactory in terms<br>of<br>thank you<br>okay<br>last but not least<br>hopefully um<br>just in regard to um<br>climate mobility and things like that<br>is there any<br>treaty work going on or under<br>consideration<br>about<br>if people in the pacific<br>do<br>lose their physical territory and it<br>becomes an uninhabitable and they have<br>to move is there any work going on about<br>to preserve their nationhood or<br>sovereignty<br>what's going on in that space<br>new zealand has supported a declaration<br>on preserving maritime zones um within<br>the i think the pacific islands forum<br>so that as sea levels rise and at holes<br>that would normally give rise give<br>rights for maritime boundaries uh<br>engulfed um that there will be<br>um further work done to preserve those<br>zones at least among specific islands<br>what about<br>preserving the maritime zones but what<br>about the people themselves preserving<br>their<br>community hood or nation yeah<br>there's definitely work being done on it<br>but i'm not the crosstalk i'm afraid<br>yeah there is there is work and it<br>sounds like our artist online can help<br>us with it but uh<br>you know migration with with dignity or<br>yes free scan<br>a big part of the thinking<br>that there has been talk quite a lot of<br>talk about climate refugees it's got a<br>good<br>sound to it but actually specifically<br>people say they don't want to be<br>regarded as refugees<br>and it doesn't really fit the<br>definitions accepted definitions of<br>refugee status<br>migration paths is going to be<br>what we're looking at<br>and and preserving nationhood is<br>something<br>bruce did you want to jump in if you had<br>bruce<br>you're on mute<br>so i don't work for infect so i'm not<br>speaking for infit but i can certainly<br>say that they're that are watching brief<br>across<br>the issue of of state or the<br>implications to statehood i sit on an<br>international law committee that's<br>intersecting with the international law<br>commission's work on the space we<br>drafted something called the city<br>declaration<br>which was picked up and that was in the<br>work program of the international law<br>commission so there is our ongoing<br>program of work around what sea level<br>rise might mean if anything for<br>statehood but my view on that that the<br>uh the discussion is a bit overblown<br>i mean if you actually look at the way<br>in which states have<br>responded to um<br>changes in any of the indicators of<br>state or the extended ones is they're<br>pragmatic<br>and i think they're actually made a very<br>interesting argument for example i think<br>at the la at this the last general<br>assembly um<br>that you know the international law<br>regime around the 1933 convention uh the<br>montevideo convention talks about state<br>formation it says absolutely nothing<br>around state extinction and so<br>um there's that issue to consider<br>there's some really interesting<br>arguments being made by the<br>international law commission which i<br>think can be developed quite further<br>but i think ultimately um<br>it's going to be dealt with in the realm<br>of politics not international law if<br>there's a place for international law to<br>try to sharpen and focus some of the<br>debates but ultimately i think it's<br>going to be settled in the realm of<br>international politics and not<br>international law but certainly i know<br>there's a in fact i've got to watch your<br>eye on on these developments so i can't<br>comment on what they're actually doing<br>in-house<br>thank you very much indeed bruce that's<br>great<br>i think we should thank our speakers<br>very much indeed for fabulous session<br>and we need to go and have a wee break<br>tea break coffee break come for break so<br>we'll come back um 15 minutes so half<br>past on to our final speaker who will<br>also be fabulous i'm sure thank you very<br>much<br>we are now on to our final guest speaker<br>who is going to be equally as fabulous<br>as the former guest speakers as well and<br>this gentleman is dr robert joseph<br>and uh dr joseph has tribal affiliations<br>in the east and west coasts<br>and he is an associate professor at<br>diploma faculty of law at the university<br>of waikato<br>he is the current director of the maori<br>and indigenous governance center at<br>waikato university<br>and he is also the current founding<br>member<br>tito mata in the ministry for foreign<br>affairs and trade<br>dealing with maori interest treaty of<br>waitangi<br>and international<br>free trade policy laws and agreements<br>and um dr joseph was a uh claude<br>mccarthy and fulbright scholar the lassa<br>at harvard university and wired at<br>university you would have known that<br>and um<br>he<br>is um<br>a representative on a number of<br>international consortia including the<br>international intertribal trade and<br>investment organization<br>and the international indigenous<br>government<br>governance consortium<br>yes<br>this is the<br>graveyard shift your time<br>so<br>i'll try and do this in some good time<br>i'm looking at<br>maori the treaty of waitangi and free<br>trade agreements it's kind of following<br>along<br>on our theme about international law<br>some important developments in the space<br>but<br>going into the whole<br>area<br>as juliet mentioned i am a member of the<br>which is a<br>new committee with the ministry of<br>foreign affairs and trade<br>um<br>it's quite an important committee too<br>and i'll talk about that a bit later on<br>i do have an output i kind of suspected<br>here keep you going<br>so i've got a number of pictures<br>i'll try and keep this to 15<br>20 minutes too<br>and then i'll be open to questions<br>so<br>yeah so these um<br>all of these diagrams i have that's to<br>help us learn and help us stay awake and<br>when you're sharing about maori i think<br>so uh first i'll talk about<br>the origin of maori it's important in<br>our context today<br>because the origin of maori there's<br>different schools of thought some say<br>they come from the east from china<br>taiwan i have spent some time with<br>indigenous peoples in taiwan and they<br>claimed and come from there<br>others say other schools thought we come<br>from the west after the americas we do<br>have strong relationships with the<br>eastern pacific<br>now what's important about these origins<br>whichever school of thought<br>we um<br>advocate that maori were great seafarers<br>great navigators sometimes referred to<br>as levitt the<br>vikings of the pacific<br>and they're navigating the biggest body<br>of water<br>in the world i.e tomorrow or the pacific<br>ocean<br>um<br>depending on what school of thought<br>again<br>during the time of the vikings and uh<br>other european nations were afraid to go<br>out of sight of land but they had not<br>waka doesn't quite capture the canoe it<br>wasn't a canoe waka was ships<br>you couldn't you couldn't row across the<br>pacific right<br>so that this big waka and um<br>what they used to do was international<br>travels a lot of things from our oral<br>accounts they were treating<br>they were engaging a lot of trade yes<br>they were warring too you know it's good<br>conflict and in fact a lot of wars over<br>trade<br>so they were doing that in other things<br>but contrary to what some<br>anthropologists say they<br>they accidentally came here not so<br>they were avid navigators they were<br>great seafarers<br>and also great international traders<br>historically traditionally so maori were<br>great risk takers innovators and<br>entrepreneurs<br>right historically and other indigenous<br>peoples on my head now just need to<br>switch quickly to how did they engage<br>and trade what were their laws<br>the legal system that was based on<br>tikanga maoi<br>i'll show you real quickly i don't have<br>time to get deeply into this i'll just<br>is similar to international<br>public international law<br>i say that in a number of respects one<br>it was based on custom<br>practice<br>two also on kawenata or agreements or<br>treaties<br>and<br>there's a third area which is similar to<br>use cogens<br>which is these inherent wrongs maori had<br>that notion as well right so tikka<br>mamali was similar<br>to international law in those respects i<br>just want to highlight though in the<br>maori world<br>maori is relational not transactional<br>it's based on relationships<br>and rights and responsibilities<br>associated in those relationships<br>i think in some of the ways<br>international law has some<br>similarities it was also<br>and i'm assuming you understand<br>as a legal system<br>of maori is always also<br>values based<br>not rules based right we have these key<br>values<br>contrary to legal positivism tikanga<br>maori is a<br>legal system<br>it's relational and strong emphasis on<br>morality<br>tikanga means doing what's right<br>just correct or appropriate so there's<br>an inherent morality particularly so<br>it's relational it's values based not<br>based<br>now with that<br>background of foundation<br>with um settler contact first in 1642<br>the dutch print was<br>footprint was light the english was a<br>lot stronger in 1769<br>but almost immediately after captain<br>cook came here<br>there was a lot of commerce going on a<br>lot of trade going on not first<br>internally but also internationally<br>and<br>the first trade items<br>are the main<br>trade items international new zealand<br>well from<br>all that maori were engaging strongly in<br>two by the way<br>with<br>whaling<br>and seals<br>then timber then the flax trade and<br>other commodities<br>unfortunately there were some seedy<br>areas of international trade<br>historically too such as the in<br>human trafficking to be frank slavery<br>prostitution<br>and these other challenge challenging<br>areas such as alcohol tobacco<br>and other addictive substances which<br>unfortunately maori is still grappling<br>with today<br>as are others but maori we were engaged<br>in this and it's why<br>i guess thesis they were starting to<br>shift and the toronto contrary to the<br>title there<br>but all this trade going on<br>engaging in it<br>in 1835 they signed a declaration of<br>independence<br>the declaration of independence they<br>signed this with the british<br>you don't know what the impetus from the<br>maori perspective was for this<br>declaration<br>no okay<br>it was trade<br>international trade was the impetus for<br>this formality what happened really<br>briefly in 1830 some maori ships with<br>their goods were impounded in poi hakina<br>which is sydney sydney harbour<br>port jackson<br>the old nate and poi hakuna their goods<br>were shipped up there for international<br>trade and they were impounded for<br>breaching maritime law and international<br>law they weren't a recognized nation<br>they didn't have a flag on their ships<br>so they're impounded which was a slight<br>in the manner or slight to the mana of<br>the chiefs at the time<br>as a result of that they came back here<br>discussed with the british resident<br>james busby we need a declaration so we<br>can be un<br>so we could trade internationally<br>without any barriers without any<br>obstacles incidentally they had a flag<br>debate at the time<br>and shows that flag up at the top a very<br>british flag<br>they acknowledged in 1835<br>great britain was the strongest nation<br>they ruled the waves<br>so they wanted to go under or with them<br>to assist them for the international<br>trade so i share this with you just to<br>highlight that maori were<br>engaged very strongly in international<br>change historically in some ways or even<br>controlling international trade and the<br>economy<br>now the treaty of waitangi carried on<br>their their position amongst other<br>things depending on what your view is on<br>the translations and so on<br>i'll just say this one thing that they<br>did<br>want to guaranteed<br>from a multi-pacifi perspective in terms<br>of consensus and eden<br>was prosperity<br>was carrying on with their trade<br>and<br>after the treaty we entered a period of<br>maori referred to as fairawa<br>well the golden age of maori<br>developments with maori engaging a lot<br>stronger in international trade and also<br>national trade for that matter<br>and the king of putta at the top there<br>one of the reasons he was asked to be<br>the king in this area<br>is because of the amazing economic<br>prosperity in this area as well as a few<br>other<br>cultural considerations as whakapapa<br>having what we call manafort<br>has ascribed mana from his genealogy but<br>also<br>or has achieved mana from what he done<br>in life<br>prosperity his progress in war and a<br>number of other things that's why he was<br>selected to be or nominated to be the<br>king<br>uh waikato tainu are now focused in this<br>area<br>there was a lot of prosperity in this<br>area a lot of international trade going<br>on maori had their own<br>flower mills<br>their own newspapers<br>and even here they have your own bank<br>again a lot of this is not well-known<br>but it is factual<br>we'll just provide a real quick example<br>okay it's eight minutes so far from<br>the gentleman on your left there's one<br>in papita from<br>uh<br>area from the uppercut<br>and governor gray on the right governor<br>governor gray came in 1846 1852<br>there was a lot of economic development<br>going on here this area's name known as<br>the granary of the north island<br>farming orchards<br>wheat<br>and juani papita out at rangiolfia just<br>outside of telugu they built three<br>flower mills<br>in their village<br>and then the first flower that they'd<br>ground from their wheat<br>uh so governor graham came and visited<br>them they gifted it to governor grey<br>as a gift to give to queen victoria oh i<br>forgot to mention to you the declaration<br>of independence and the treaty in the<br>maori world<br>they are agreements<br>covenants<br>covenants agreements and similar to<br>judaism and cohen in the maori world as<br>a binding agreement between parties<br>what happened here was they sent their<br>first fruits up to queen victoria<br>in 1849<br>have all their correspondence by<br>governor grey queen victoria was<br>startled by it in the colonial office<br>they were startled by this too but she<br>reciprocated by sending two of these<br>paintings<br>they were very prosperous they had three<br>churches catholic church in anglican<br>churches<br>but these portraits of the royal family<br>hung in the churches group now to maori<br>specifically<br>that<br>was a kawainata they govern a covenant<br>or agreement<br>between ngati apokura<br>and the british monarch queen victoria<br>specifically at a tribal level<br>the treaty was at a<br>pan maori level national level<br>and so<br>you had all this trade going on there's<br>just some of the statistics so maori<br>were shipping all the goods up the<br>waikato river the waipa river up to<br>auckland and elsewhere<br>there's some of the stats i need to go<br>fast there's some more of them<br>12 000 pounds<br>which in 1854<br>was a lot of<br>money they were also engaging in<br>international trade sending some of<br>their goods over to australia<br>to the gold field and also to san<br>francisco to the gold field zoo<br>and i've got a lot of information on<br>this they're engaging heavily in<br>the red line is the rivers the waikato<br>river and the waipa river they were very<br>important number of reasons but<br>economically as aqua highways for<br>shipping their goods<br>the blue and the red<br>squares are the flower mills<br>in the waikato from 1846 to 1861<br>which is why this area was known as the<br>greenery of the north island so a lot of<br>economic development maori were in<br>effect controlling the economy and the<br>biggest tax payers<br>and also international trade kafir as<br>you can see there was where they used to<br>send their goods over to australia into<br>the pacific and elsewhere<br>as place of great prosperity<br>so<br>maori were innovative<br>international traders this is what james<br>balance military historian said about<br>also<br>university historian said about maori<br>with mighty were capable and competitive<br>entrepreneurs who could produce<br>harvest commodities such as flax timber<br>on a large scale in this context the<br>cooperative structure of internal tribal<br>organization and system of mutual<br>obligation<br>implied by the custom of utu with<br>distinct assets<br>close quote so that's our great new<br>zealand stern that's the penguin history<br>of new zealand that's from his book<br>there<br>so what happened<br>great traders controlling the economy<br>and controlling international trade what<br>happened<br>is interesting when you look at the<br>ukraine war<br>um<br>so<br>the rumor was there was genocide<br>occurring in in the ukraine<br>funnily enough in a similar manner<br>the war in the y cuttle was generated by<br>a rumor<br>that the waikato tribes were going to<br>invade auckland<br>auckland city<br>so before they invade auckland city we<br>better invade them<br>and that's what happened<br>so he breached a lot of the tikkun<br>governor great he could call it a maori<br>too actually<br>that worked a lot molly so there are<br>these wars going on one thing i'll say<br>is most wars over two things when we<br>boil it down<br>sovereignty and property<br>right i'll almost guarantee that's what<br>the ukraine's about to<br>but anyway so that happens and that's<br>colonialism globalism where you're<br>displaced from the sites of power that's<br>what happened to maori in the economy<br>law<br>the environment<br>international trade too so from this<br>period prosperity maori we're now<br>legally institutionally locked out of<br>international trade<br>fast forward to today<br>we have these treaty settlements going<br>on which are about among other things<br>rectifying the past<br>and these breaches of<br>uh the treaty historic and contemporary<br>breaches approximately 80 have been<br>signed to date<br>depending who you're talking to it's<br>highly political<br>possibly halfway there according to<br>someone<br>so if all these treaty settlements going<br>on there's a lot of economic development<br>being resurrected and so on and<br>international trade maori engaging again<br>in the space you have treated waiting<br>principles you know all about these<br>three p's partnership protection<br>participation<br>i would like to add a third sorry a<br>fourth p<br>shared prosperity two it's not just<br>procedural it's outcome focused too<br>like maori had when they signed the<br>treaty and they were controlling<br>international trade and the economy<br>but as a result of treaty settlements<br>and maori land trusts and incorporations<br>of other maori corporates like today<br>there are over ten thousand mild<br>corporates corporate organizations<br>engaging in international not<br>international economic development in<br>some shape or form a number of them are<br>engaging in international trade too<br>so that today the latest statistics is a<br>growing maori economy<br>maori controlled 50 percent of fisheries<br>that's commercial fisheries<br>40 percent of forestry 30 of lamb<br>production 30 of sheep and beef<br>10 percent of kiwi fruit and 10 percent<br>of dairy<br>challenge in this area like it was<br>historically its primary sect the focus<br>they are diversifying into other areas<br>energy infrastructure social procurement<br>telecommunications<br>ip intellectual property and other areas<br>so maori are investing overseas one of<br>their biggest partners was china and as<br>i mentioned earlier chicago maori modern<br>legal system is relational and values<br>based<br>international trade is relational from a<br>monthly perspective relational and<br>values based<br>what are our shared values to enter into<br>a relationship<br>once we have trust<br>right never mind the transaction<br>the relationship's fundamental first<br>and once that's set now let's talk<br>business and i believe i understand<br>that's how maori um commercial fisheries<br>got the partnership with nasui<br>they're our partners for the commercial<br>fishing for hokkaido<br>where other new zealanders were trying<br>to engage in a lot of business and trade<br>with the japanese it was a lot faster<br>with maori another asian nations because<br>similar values<br>similar customs<br>and so on<br>anyway so fast forward to today a lot of<br>international trade going on maori<br>engaging in it then<br>the maori economy currently valued at<br>five more minutes it's<br>currently valued at 70 billion<br>so a lot of economic development going<br>on<br>and trade so it's part of this remember<br>i mentioned motor locked out of the<br>international trade<br>sector now we're getting back into it<br>and what amphant did in 2019<br>was the established te tomata<br>it's a treaty partnership between<br>ministry of foreign affairs and trade<br>and this maori committee i just happened<br>to be at the final national hui at the<br>time and was nominated on to this<br>with all accidental and i've been there<br>ever since then my wife's whinging about<br>the time i put into this<br>but it is an important form<br>so this uh mata is about a treaty<br>partnership in the private sector in the<br>international trade space<br>we have a lot more women on it now too<br>by the way three women now but those are<br>the nominations there were a number of<br>hui that were held the final who had<br>asked for nominations for this committee<br>but this committee actually assists mfat<br>with his treaty obligations<br>with free trade agreements policy<br>um the world is changing in<br>international trade space due to covet<br>so things and politics of protectionism<br>so trying to make the playing field with<br>fda's a bit more<br>equitable particularly in terms of labor<br>smes right place of women human rights<br>environment<br>sustainability climate change<br>and also indigenous communities<br>and you know<br>yeah<br>now as specifically new zealand we've<br>already talked about the uk new zealand<br>free trade agreement<br>and also the<br>oh<br>we have this toki right<br>if you're not at the tables of power<br>you're on the menu<br>in the past maori have been on the menu<br>now our mother is actually sitting at<br>these tables of power<br>when they were negotiating these free<br>trade agreements we were contributing<br>directly to the ftas<br>i have to confess we had to fight truth<br>and nail<br>to include in regards an indigenous<br>chapter and both ftas<br>a lot of politicking going on i<br>specifically went through the with the<br>uk ambassador and other leaders there to<br>remind them of the declaration of<br>independence the treaty this agreement<br>of this<br>ngati apakura and these other<br>developments that happened historically<br>here<br>which cemented from the maori<br>perspective anyway<br>this relationship between maori and the<br>british crew<br>and so we had some responsibilities and<br>obligations that were ongoing they<br>finally relented or some politicians<br>coming in and i have to say this in the<br>11th hour 59th minute<br>indigenous chapter included in both<br>in fact the european union one signed<br>about three weeks ago the european union<br>ambassador came and spoke at a<br>symposium we ran here<br>and he actually mentioned<br>that the role of our mother was<br>important in helping you understand<br>what maori wanted and also aligning our<br>maori values with some of the important<br>european values<br>and<br>when you have a look at it some of the<br>winds the farmers are grumbling includes<br>the maori farmers too and they said the<br>european farmers are gambling<br>but it's been really good for a lot of<br>maori corporates in the commercial<br>fisheries space kiwi fruit other fruit<br>and vegetables<br>and manuka<br>amongst others<br>so we've been sitting at the table we're<br>also sitting with these other<br>free trade agreements that are currently<br>being negotiated i have some booklets<br>here which describe all of these that<br>have told me commissioned if anyone's<br>interested you can come and get some of<br>these from me<br>after all i said to say this and finish<br>off here i'm the new zealand<br>representative on this organization the<br>international inter-tribal trade an<br>investment organization some of you<br>might<br>recognize the gentleman at the end on<br>the right here<br>our former dean<br>um on this organization and others what<br>we're trying to do is facilitate<br>indigenous trade<br>and direct indigenous to indigenous<br>trade right and our free trade<br>agreements but also directly to as we<br>did historically we're trying to<br>resurrect some of these old<br>relationships we're getting there too<br>starting with uh some of the casinos in<br>oklahoma on their reserve<br>getting some of our maori commercial<br>fishing<br>just working really almost there on that<br>so from a maori perspective when we look<br>at international trade<br>our view is its commerce through culture<br>finance through papa and trade through<br>tradition<br>so we've entered into a free trade<br>agreement with the indigenous peoples in<br>taiwan<br>2020 within australia with aborigines<br>and trying to do a few more<br>but<br>we can we're not locked out of the<br>international trade space anymore we're<br>gaining more momentum there and so my<br>no that was great that was so<br>fascinating thank you robert so oh we've<br>got time for questions<br>um<br>as ever i will monitor chat and<br>wave at me whatever but first and<br>foremost forgot emily thank you this is<br>a very important question so<br>sorry about the comment that i said<br>about james belch being man i'm a bit of<br>a super fan of him and so anyway my<br>question is<br>in relation to this never-ending debate<br>you know could new zealand become a<br>dependent<br>independent country do you think in<br>relation to<br>how we have progressed and even maori<br>have progress in relation to<br>international trade<br>that's not gonna that won't be in our<br>best interest what's your view<br>i for sure answer it's not in our best<br>interest i don't think any country is<br>really independent in terms of classic<br>sovereignty<br>that's what free trade agreements are<br>about you're surrendering some of your<br>sovereignty and independence<br>for your vital interests<br>so we're not<br>maybe russian would be proclaiming<br>they're totally independent but even<br>then yeah i don't think it would be good<br>i agree<br>after seeing your presentation there's<br>so can i have a copy of the slides<br>yes sir and do you mind if i pitch some<br>of that information yeah sure i'm hoping<br>pictures would keep you awake<br>my question though is if you're um if<br>maori are involved in some of these free<br>trade agreements<br>um<br>how do maori business<br>engage with t<br>thai mother i mean is it something you<br>do as a general thing or is it something<br>that each maori business can approach<br>you<br>for<br>i see that's a good question um how do<br>my businesses engage with photographers<br>the<br>that is<br>i guess trying to champion maori<br>interests in the space<br>there are others so we're not the only<br>one<br>but in terms of us engaging with maori<br>businesses and maori generally<br>what we've held over the last two and a<br>half years is we take we bring mfat<br>and<br>and the<br>ministers of trade and others other key<br>players to maori communities<br>and that's what we did three weeks ago<br>we had this symposium here and we've<br>done it in rotorua<br>nelson gisborne<br>up in pai here we're bringing them to<br>our maori communities and it's an<br>opportunity for our maori to come and<br>talk with them to find out what's<br>happening in space what's beneficial for<br>them<br>challenged engage so on and so forth<br>that's one of our best ways of trying to<br>be accountable to our people<br>also i guess through social media<br>we have a website<br>online<br>trying to send out all our information<br>to our maori cookbooks we do have a<br>database<br>thousands i forget how much but a lot of<br>our maori businesses who are working in<br>this space we have them on our database<br>and send them all<br>so our newsletters so forth but it's not<br>easy being accountable to the maori<br>community we don't know in any community<br>for that matter<br>but we're trying to<br>in that space<br>so running that out if you could just<br>trade deals that have been done between<br>uk and individual maori uh<br>corporates in the lead up to the frayed<br>free trade agreement because there's<br>been quite a lot of action in that space<br>over the past two three years yes there<br>was a lot of action um the british high<br>commission actually was attending all of<br>our<br>regional symposium<br>original meetings she was there and<br>hosted<br>um you know dinners the night before it<br>started<br>tomorrow and maori corporates were<br>invited there and engaging directly with<br>us spent a lot of time with them<br>and we were you know sort of championing<br>a lot of our<br>our corporations interests directly with<br>them too as well as with the european<br>union<br>uh ambassador leaders<br>so and also<br>at our regional meetings<br>they're usually one or two days the<br>first half<br>as the government mfat presents and<br>minister and so on the second half is<br>the local maori corporates present<br>to give them an idea of where in the<br>space and we need to work with you right<br>how can we you know benefit best from<br>these free trade agreements<br>and so there's a lot of activity on<br>proactive activity going on from the<br>maori corporates without thomas and some<br>of these other<br>committees<br>working in these particular such as<br>professor jamie kelsey who's online<br>she's involved in one of the other maori<br>committees and others to<br>proactively<br>um assist<br>maori corporates in the space<br>and that's your question<br>and i just thought it was<br>good just to get some of that other<br>background out there yeah<br>it's been very proactive a lot of work a<br>lot of resources<br>going into this<br>thank you very much and we've got a<br>question from ann up on the zoom screen<br>and<br>auckland<br>um so i hear a lot what you're saying<br>about<br>getting the advantages of the fda's out<br>to maori businesses but a key effect of<br>the fts is their effect on regulatory<br>autonomy and the restrictions that they<br>bring for states when they sign up to<br>these<br>and i wonder<br>what input have you had in the<br>development of these rules<br>and<br>do you think that these new indigenous<br>chapters provide enough protection<br>so that we do retain space<br>within new zealand<br>to<br>regulate it for maori interest in a way<br>that<br>so we were<br>pushing strong for maori interests<br>and it's more substantive<br>however some of the results of the<br>indigenous chapter<br>example for the european union<br>i mentioned that commercial fisheries<br>are gaining access into the european<br>union<br>from day one when it was implemented and<br>with<br>and as i mentioned earlier<br>maori corporates control 50 of that<br>industry<br>and so for maori which that's a big word<br>not the maori farmers same with the new<br>zealand general farmers those big<br>challenges but we were focusing in those<br>areas more substantive<br>sort of<br>implications or<br>substantive areas of the fgas<br>and the importance of the treaty the<br>importance of the historic relationship<br>and future relationship and what this<br>means<br>in terms of<br>actual benefits<br>for maori communities<br>i'll just say this too<br>in new zealand<br>one in four jobs<br>in new zealand are dependent on<br>international trade<br>that's a very important area for our<br>country<br>thank you yeah<br>we could carry on a discussion later by<br>email<br>so we've got a few more questions or a<br>few more people who want to ask<br>questions so next up is tano i hope i've<br>pronounced your name correctly there<br>thank you very much for your um your<br>presentation<br>full disclosure i work at the ministry<br>of foreign affairs and trade in the<br>trading economic group<br>um noting the<br>uh<br>significant increase in activity<br>uh from maori on international trade<br>matters in recent years tomato<br>established in 2019<br>i wonder if you might um<br>cast your vision forward 10<br>15 20 years from now<br>um<br>and<br>and tell us what you see what that looks<br>like<br>that's a million-dollar question that<br>party<br>um<br>what would you like to see<br>yeah yeah<br>okay can i just start answering it by uh<br>tokyo by<br>after they lost everything in the war<br>their lands were confiscated they were<br>popularized and so on<br>this guiding whakatauki for tainui going<br>forward<br>was<br>where there is no vision that people<br>perish<br>they needed a shared vision<br>under the<br>supporter of the king and tongue to<br>carry them forward which led to the<br>treaty settlement and all the economic<br>development going on now<br>so it was intergenerational they're<br>getting a similar respect<br>we need a cohesive vision for our people<br>our communities<br>and then the corporates<br>going forward not the other way around<br>i have to disclose<br>some uh the challenges going on with the<br>maori economy is our tribal corporates<br>are becoming<br>billionaires<br>but our tribal communities are still<br>poor<br>poor health poor housing undereducated<br>and so on and so forth so there's a<br>disconnect there<br>so they need to be directed by the<br>communities rather than the corporates<br>and with our wider governance vision and<br>economic development international trade<br>going forward<br>it has to incorporate within that vision<br>what i call a<br>that was me<br>the fourties of maori governance<br>has to incorporate traditional<br>transactional<br>um transcendental and transformational<br>governance<br>currently it's focusing on transaction<br>it has to incorporate those only three<br>as well<br>the traditional transactional<br>transcendental and transformational<br>coming back more specifically to your<br>question<br>i think in 10 years time might be going<br>to be key players<br>in international trade again 10 20 years<br>if we carry on on this<br>this trend<br>as it were<br>with our free trade agreements<br>supporting maori development more<br>maori in the trade space<br>from my experience working overseas too<br>i have to admit<br>being maori<br>is an advantage<br>an advantage for us here and i'll<br>maintain that at an institutional<br>national level too<br>in terms of what's important to us our<br>values<br>and relationships then transactions<br>right including many of these issues<br>we've discussed today about climate<br>change<br>maori subscribe to this to those values<br>and so on so i'm hoping and answered<br>your question tania might be bigger<br>players in the international training<br>area<br>but also their communities are<br>significantly improving with that<br>economic growth too<br>thank you very much we've got i think<br>time for just two more questions so<br>we've got dara and we've got alberta oh<br>last we'll fit you in a third one as<br>well in that case songs is quick<br>so i'm i'm all for free trade agreements<br>i see them as<br>a way for not just only maori but for<br>all communities to improve their places<br>and spaces<br>but the thing about maori particular<br>that worries me about these free trade<br>agreements is that they're revolving<br>doors<br>they're too wastery how do maori protect<br>their donor<br>you know how do we protect that here<br>because you know it's all very well for<br>us to say let's engage in international<br>trade and<br>and i agree with you maori we're big<br>traders i can remember my grandparents<br>uh talking about this years ago<br>but they were trading in sydney they<br>were trading outside of new zealand and<br>protecting<br>you know their senua how do we protect<br>that donga from all of these free trade<br>agreements um<br>would be better you talked with<br>professor kelsey about that one<br>um<br>yeah we've got to protect our target i<br>suppose with free trade agreements<br>some might say we could be vulnerable<br>to the whole international space going<br>on<br>dependent on these rules functioning of<br>but in terms of specific<br>protections of maori tongue in terms of<br>intellectual property<br>pvr all of those yeah all those things i<br>don't know if you're aware of the<br>big dispute going on as we speak on<br>ip around manuka<br>is much sought after internationally<br>for its medicinal properties<br>and it's worth a lot of money<br>i've seen it in the airports and<br>overseas and almost fell over about how<br>much it costs them<br>but there's a big debate going on with<br>australian corporates trying to claim<br>they have manuka as well and they're<br>using that label manuka<br>you're trying to uh the trust that's<br>leading someone else<br>they've been taking them<br>to task about it and saying that's a<br>maori word not an australian word you<br>know it's all that debate<br>what's going on but<br>um that's what this<br>report's about geographic indicators and<br>maori interests and point p<br>you know what's that i can give that to<br>you<br>but the free trade agreement<br>and there we've been negotiating the<br>importance of geographic indicators and<br>iep<br>that's important there and in the<br>european union<br>fta includes kahane protection of it and<br>getting access into the european union<br>with no tariffs<br>yeah it's still vulnerable though<br>goods are overseas and it's hard to<br>protect ip<br>in the international<br>arena<br>it seems to be trendy in some countries<br>the haka<br>so it's hard to protect<br>but<br>hopefully in our free trading so we can<br>get better protections in there for them<br>but yeah it's as you say a<br>two-way door going both ways your<br>strengths and vulnerabilities weaknesses<br>thank you<br>thank you rob<br>so<br>the the involvement of of<br>our interest in trade negotiations is a<br>recent developer development<br>what are the challenges that you think<br>that play ahead for these participation<br>name of the tomatoes specifically<br>what could be taro mata or<br>yeah i can comment on the term<br>but there's a number of challenges one<br>of them is<br>we're doing this in the main<br>um<br>you know out of good will<br>and it's quite exhausting it's taking a<br>lot of time and<br>energy from us and we're here it is out<br>of good will or do we get paid for<br>meetings we attend but it's quite<br>minimal with respect to impact<br>i think that's a government issue that<br>um yeah<br>as i mentioned my wife<br>kind of complaining about me being old<br>mr buddy saying in effect again<br>million dollar advice for peanuts<br>we're doing so you know there's that<br>challenge and the challenge of burnout<br>for us<br>i'm involved in too many things<br>and my teaching here too of course<br>but you know a lot of tribal matters our<br>kids<br>other committees<br>which is important for pbrf by the way<br>justification in some ways but yeah and<br>so<br>there's those challenges about<br>resourcing<br>um<br>the challenge another challenge for us<br>as atonement is some of these other<br>respect competing committees<br>um but we have to take our head off to<br>the leadership and ministry of foreign<br>affairs and train particularly van<br>gaalis<br>he's a great ambassador<br>for new zealand an international trade<br>our interests but also support for maori<br>in this space too so we've got a key um<br>leader with an mfat who's supporting us<br>but in that respect what happens if he<br>leaves so there's those challenges for<br>us<br>as to tomata<br>numerous others funding<br>um<br>competing interests i mentioned earlier<br>how we were nominated at the national<br>gui<br>now we're trying to formalize processes<br>more than institutionalize them all we<br>have a constitution and all these other<br>things<br>and<br>um i think<br>i know it's subjective but we've done<br>quite a lot<br>since our establishment in 2019<br>with these reports mobilizing our people<br>our corporates with our involvement in<br>the fdas<br>and so on<br>and so<br>often once you<br>start getting some good momentum<br>and others want to try and come in and<br>you know play on that that's the<br>challenge of multi governance too by the<br>way<br>um and so there's those challenges and<br>loss of institutional memory<br>and you know original vision somewhat<br>and something<br>some of the<br>key<br>challenges i see for us as a team<br>thanks so much thank you and we will<br>finish with a question from you thank<br>you yeah i was just i was thinking about<br>the disparity between the modern<br>i mean it seems strange to me that a lot<br>you know like<br>you know 50 of prisoners are maori you<br>know you would have thought there would<br>be a good pathway for a lot of people in<br>prisons but is it<br>is is there problems with like the<br>ownership you know like do if we have<br>control ultimately<br>he have control over this or who owns<br>maori<br>with the commercial fisheries settlement<br>which was in 1992<br>there were a lot of challenges over<br>there commissioners and maori initially<br>were<br>given ten percent<br>of fishing quota<br>so the partnership was<br>1910 ratio<br>and after that<br>in 2004 one of the challenges was<br>who are the beneficiaries of the<br>settlement<br>and which corporate represents those<br>beneficiaries<br>and i went to court<br>three or four times went to the privy<br>council too actually trying to<br>define who is an ewe<br>and particularly in terms of the<br>commercial fisheries<br>so you have that<br>and then who represents those ewe<br>interests<br>and so they all had to establish their<br>own mios or mandated ewe organizations<br>and a corporate entity to represent them<br>which usually company<br>what's happened since then<br>was uh some of them went weren't as<br>astute<br>in this industry<br>what they've been doing is some of them<br>have been<br>leasing their quota<br>to<br>non-maori corporates or to other maori<br>corporates some of them have also been<br>aggregating the quota interests<br>the uh<br>icp<br>standpoint let's say<br>a partnership limited liability<br>partnership<br>established by<br>15 smaller ewings with this quota so<br>that they could pull their interests<br>together and build some scale<br>so you've got that<br>um<br>development where others have been you<br>know just leasing it to more mild you<br>know for<br>you know for profit<br>and so as a result of all that<br>yeah they haven't always taken on<br>maori or<br>helped maori in this industry<br>right where you're getting they're just<br>employing who's the best one for the job<br>it is a challenge though<br>i have to say<br>nothing in the mighty world or something<br>and<br>you know it's one thing i've been<br>involved with trust we want to employ<br>well some have been in jail and<br>you know not uh haven't been brought up<br>in good<br>environment<br>but then trying to employ them and<br>making sure they turn up to work and<br>they're not drunk you know all those<br>types of issues it's sort of occurred to<br>those<br>challenges<br>but at the same time supposed to be<br>trying to generate a profit<br>but acknowledging those other cultural<br>social issues too<br>so we're trying to tackle that but i<br>have to confess with maori<br>maori corporates at present we're<br>becoming too corporatized<br>yeah and i've written a book about that<br>actually now further into that<br>in more detail<br>thank you very much indeed i think we<br>need to see<br>thank you so much julie then<br>well just to thank you and all those<br>presents here and also those online<br>for your attendance and today<br>but i think it has been a great event in<br>learned a lot about international law<br>and also about domestic law the<br>interaction between international<br>and domestic law that is<br>not always evident<br>when we talk about international law<br>issues<br>so<br>i hope you have enjoyed the<br>these three sessions<br>there is a recording so we will<br>be available soon on the university on<br>the faculty's<br>website<br>thanks a lot obviously to our speakers<br>from mfat and and from pepperinga and uh<br>for the<br>exceptional uh presentations to you for<br>your for your questions
