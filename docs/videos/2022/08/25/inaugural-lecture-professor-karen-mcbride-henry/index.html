Professor Karen McBride-Henry discusses her research exploring the experience of parents with children under two years of age who have been repeatedly admitted to hospital with acute respiratory infections. Parents describe hospitals as ‘in-hospital’ and share the broader social impacts of repeated hospitalisations on their families.   <br><br>Through her lecture, Professor McBride-Henry reflects on the policy and healthcare implications of her research into families managing recurring respiratory illness with repeated hospitalisation for their young children.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity:

colleagues<br>students and our wider community to the<br>inaugural lecturer of professor of<br>nursing karen mcbride henry<br>i'm jennifer windsor acting vice<br>chancellor tejeringawaka<br>university of wellington and it's my<br>pleasure to welcome people here in<br>person this evening and also to welcome<br>the very many people who have asked for<br>the video of this event as well<br>professor mcbride henry completed her<br>first degree in nursing in arizona in<br>the u.s<br>before moving back to new zealand in<br>1994 and building her career as a<br>registered nurse in south auckland<br>she later returned to academia<br>completing her phd in nursing at massey<br>university in 2004.<br>she joined our university as a research<br>fellow fellow in 2006 and was director<br>of the human services research center<br>from 2019 to the start of 2021.<br>karen's known as a superb postgraduate<br>and phd supervisor and mentor as well as<br>a highly talented and engaged scholar<br>and she was named a professor in 2020<br>21.<br>professor mcbride henry's research and<br>scholarship is preeminent in the way<br>that it draws on both health policy and<br>health promotion<br>and how she focuses on how patients<br>experience access to health services as<br>consumers<br>now i think we all know that this has<br>always been a critically important area<br>of research and practice and it has<br>perhaps unfortunately taken the covert<br>pandemic with its frequent news reports<br>of the preparation of the health sector<br>and the challenges for and dedication of<br>frontline nurses and other healthcare<br>professionals<br>to highlight for us what patients their<br>families whanau have always known<br>that patient experiences are fundamental<br>to health care<br>and<br>moreover<br>that we rely every day<br>on the leadership of scholar<br>practitioners like karen who work to<br>understand and improve patient<br>experience<br>most recently karen has examined how<br>individuals with disabilities have<br>accessed health and disability services<br>during covert and she's also examined<br>the social stresses of lockdowns and<br>access to health services during this<br>time<br>i'd point out though that her recent<br>research on the pandemic<br>builds on her extensive body of work<br>across a broad range of other areas that<br>includes everything from experiences of<br>breastfeeding to access to prescription<br>medicines to the really important topic<br>that she'll talk about tonight<br>the experiences of patients of i'm sorry<br>the experience of parents of the<br>repeated hospital admissions<br>of their young children with acute<br>illness<br>and the societal and policy implications<br>of how best to support family whanau and<br>community resiliency around kawai can be<br>really traumatic circumstances<br>i think you'll see tonight<br>that karen's scholarship is undeniably<br>impactful<br>and perhaps particularly so because her<br>research is marked by its focus on<br>people's lived<br>experiences what's important about some<br>of karen's work is that her research<br>methodology often includes qualitative<br>as well as quantitative insights through<br>interviews and surveys and patient<br>narratives it's all at the front line<br>from the ground up<br>now scholars often aspire to show the<br>real world impact of their research its<br>contemporary relevance and there's just<br>no question and no need for me to talk<br>about that tonight<br>because karen's programmatic research<br>and practice<br>is a very direct compelling and<br>meaningful application<br>of that intersection of research and<br>practice<br>and i'd go so far as saying<br>that i think karen's career focus on<br>strong patient and community outcomes<br>and positive change<br>is a value-driven lens that has<br>karen<br>thank you<br>many congratulations on your<br>professorship<br>and now it is my great pleasure<br>to invite professor karen mcbride henry<br>to the podium<br>it is such an honor to be standing here<br>this evening talking to you all<br>and<br>it's slightly overwhelming but it is an<br>absolute pleasure to be here um and i<br>thank you for coming this evening i<br>appreciate that your time is precious<br>and the fact that you were willing to<br>come and share it with<br>me this evening<br>means a lot so<br>i also want to acknowledge the<br>distinguished<br>members of academia that are sitting<br>here in the room<br>my colleagues<br>so before i broach the topic that you've<br>come here to listen to<br>on such auspicious occasions we have the<br>opportunity<br>to provide you with a little bit of<br>insight into who i am as a person and to<br>acknowledge those that have played a key<br>role in my life<br>and in my scholarship journey<br>so i wanted to um start with the fact<br>that it's not too surprising that i<br>became a nurse<br>i have grandparents who are nurses a<br>mother who is a nurse<br>two sisters who are nurses and numerous<br>cousins who are also nurses so one might<br>argue that it's in our dna<br>um and it is um<br>so having<br>been raised with all of these stories<br>about nursing um it was a privilege to<br>be able apologies to um<br>to explore<br>nursing in more depth um i wanted to<br>just acknowledge a key set of people in<br>my life my parents david neville and<br>mcbride my mother has traveled here and<br>is with us tonight<br>and my father is watching us<br>currently live streamed<br>um i also wanted to acknowledge my<br>parents-in-law<br>my father-in-law is a theoretic a<br>nuclear physicist and he kindly read an<br>early draft of my phd<br>he thought it was slightly mind-bending<br>but provided me with some thoughtful<br>feedback<br>and i'm ever so grateful with his input<br>into my very early academic career<br>and my mother-in-law lisa henry is no<br>longer with us but she was also a nurse<br>so as you can see very much surrounded<br>by nurses<br>i also wanted to acknowledge my sisters<br>um cherisa tania and sarah<br>and also my beloved husband norm<br>who is also a theory theoretical<br>physicist so again we have interesting<br>conversations around our dining room<br>table<br>and also my children isaac matthew elise<br>and samuel<br>you constantly encouraged me to be all<br>that i am capable of being so i want to<br>thank you<br>as mentioned earlier<br>i moved to arizona and<br>studied there<br>and<br>was inspired by my nursing academics<br>colleagues that were there as teachers<br>and i remember standing outside the<br>library one day of grand canyon<br>university saying i think i'm going to<br>get my phd at one point in my life<br>so there i kind of set a goal for myself<br>and i'm<br>slightly relentless in my pursuit of<br>that goal<br>so i came back to new zealand enrolled<br>in a master's program and into my phd<br>whilst working in a number of<br>nursing settings from acute care<br>emergency department and into primary<br>health care and public health positions<br>and had the honor of working with<br>incredible clinicians and academics<br>whilst i mentored and<br>that i was mentored by as i grew in my<br>scholarship<br>i also want to acknowledge<br>in addition to all of my many colleagues<br>for whom i am very grateful<br>for their constant support over many<br>years um i wanted to also acknowledge dr<br>michael rogaski<br>he is an academic who constantly calls<br>me to rethink and challenge knowledge<br>theories and norms<br>and it is a privilege to<br>in my discipline it is typical to work<br>in research teams so the work that i<br>present tonight isn't<br>solely my own although i led this<br>research<br>from beginning to end i also wanted to<br>acknowledge theresa miller<br>dr adrian trinham and dr tara officer<br>for their input<br>also as mentioned by professor windsor<br>my research involves people trusting me<br>with their stories with their tonga<br>their treasures and i'm always deeply<br>honored that they are willing to do that<br>and i hope that<br>tonight i honor<br>their<br>gift to me<br>and to us<br>as it offers us a different way of<br>understanding and seeing the world in<br>which we live<br>so without further ado<br>um i wanted to just mention some<br>inspiration<br>behind my research<br>so when i was a young academic i read an<br>awful lot of hassell heidegger miller<br>ponte gartema they really formed the<br>philosophical basis for my research and<br>heidi had this wonderful way of<br>calling you to think differently and he<br>always said that<br>that being is always revealed in the no<br>thing or the nothingness<br>and although this is a complete<br>transliteration of what he intended<br>for me it was a call to think about<br>research differently it was about going<br>to the edge of what we know<br>foraging in the darkness to provide new<br>knowledge and some light and so i love<br>this quote from heidegger who said a<br>boundary is not<br>that at which something stops<br>it is that from which something begins<br>its presence<br>so<br>i'm my research has always been driven<br>by a desire to go to the boundary of<br>what is known<br>so lower respiratory infections those of<br>you that work in hospitals know that it<br>is one of the primary reasons why young<br>children are admitted to hospitals<br>here in aotearoa um lower<br>respiratory infections create a<br>significant health burden<br>and<br>children are more likely to be admitted<br>with lower respiratory tract infections<br>than in other international comparative<br>countries<br>so children in the lowest socioeconomic<br>quintile<br>as you can see a full point<br>nine times more likely to be admitted<br>and in the first two<br>years of life<br>um<br>children that suffer from lower<br>respiratory infections<br>go on and a portion of them go on and<br>end up with a lifelong lung condition<br>that sometimes is life<br>shortening so um<br>it's<br>it's a significant health issue for new<br>zealanders<br>we<br>didn't know we knew the numbers of<br>children that were sick we knew the<br>numbers of children that were readmitted<br>but what we didn't know was what was the<br>impact on the families of being<br>constantly readmitted when we went to<br>the literature to kind of answer some of<br>those questions<br>we found out there was actually not much<br>to know in terms of acute respiratory<br>admissions and the impact on families<br>but what we did know is that studies of<br>children admitted to the icu<br>their families<br>were very stressed experience<br>post-traumatic stress type symptoms and<br>that they needed their basic needs met<br>i.e they needed to know where to find<br>food<br>they needed to know where to park their<br>cars<br>they needed to know how to navigate the<br>hospital system<br>we also discovered that within australia<br>families spend 589 dollars per day that<br>their child is admitted<br>so that's on lost wages<br>paying for parking<br>paying for extra child care all of those<br>things<br>impact the amount that it costs families<br>in addition<br>there is a body of research that looks<br>at chronically ill children<br>and um<br>that research shows that families slowly<br>and reluctantly take charge of their<br>children's illnesses<br>and that they<br>the family dynamics are really disrupted<br>as a result of repeated hospitalizations<br>however<br>there was still an awful lot of gaps in<br>our knowledge so again i can back to the<br>edge of what we know and trying to<br>discover things that are undiscovered<br>we didn't actually understand what the<br>impact<br>was on families if their child was<br>admitted repeatedly<br>and so and there was nothing globally<br>available on what happened if your child<br>suffered recurrent acute illness so we<br>know what it was for chronic illness so<br>there's a myriad of chronic conditions<br>that affect children so we understand a<br>little bit about what impacts them but<br>we knew nothing about what happens if<br>your child's acutely ill and the<br>impact on families<br>so we conducted a piece of research that<br>aimed to examine parental or primary<br>caregivers perceptions on the impact of<br>having a child<br>repeatedly hospitalized with a lower<br>the research site was an 82 bed<br>children's hospital<br>and the population in the area consisted<br>of 24 maori<br>29.1<br>pacific and 26.4 european and 18.5<br>asian<br>58 of the birth cohort in this area<br>lives in the most deprived quintile in<br>new zealand and 25 of those with the<br>lower respiratory tract infections that<br>are admitted to hospital<br>have seven or more people living in<br>their house<br>and<br>33 live with four or more children in<br>their homes<br>and we began the study with an intense<br>series and round of cultural<br>consultations obviously knowing that we<br>were stepping into spaces where tangents<br>maori populations would<br>um<br>would need to be taken care of um<br>very carefully along with our pacific<br>populations um and so<br>we did a round of consultation went<br>through ethics review boards and<br>committees<br>um<br>and we<br>received ethics approval for this study<br>in addition the wider research team<br>included two maori<br>and one samoan researcher and they<br>supported us in terms of reviewing the<br>analysis<br>and<br>of the findings of the study<br>and with all the research protocols<br>before we begin<br>as with any research<br>there is always a methodology that<br>underpins and drives and creates the<br>principles by which you can conduct the<br>research<br>so we used reflective life called<br>research for this<br>um project again it is built on the work<br>of heidegger<br>and gartema and merlo ponti um and there<br>are three main principles that we drew<br>on to guide us in our research<br>so the notion of openness this is about<br>attending to a phenomenon or an<br>experience afresh with no preconceived<br>ideas about what you might find<br>and given that we knew nothing it was<br>quite easy<br>to approach the field of research not<br>knowing too much<br>um in this case<br>the notion of historicity means that<br>accepts the premise that we're all<br>thrown into a world<br>it's a situation in history that moment<br>in history creates<br>a lot of knowledge and understandings<br>and it's with all of that history that<br>we approach a research<br>phenomenon<br>so again mindful that our<br>pre-interpretations cloud and<br>potentially influence how we might<br>interpret<br>results<br>and finally hermeneutic circle<br>this premise and this principle says<br>that interpretations are never finished<br>tonight as you're sitting here you will<br>have your own interpretations and your<br>mind will wander off and<br>you'll make your own interpretations of<br>the material that i'll present<br>so um i invite you to do this<br>because it's in those spaces that new<br>thinking<br>happens<br>and then from that perspective we can<br>start collectively impacting the world<br>so i just wanted to offer a note of<br>caution some of the narratives that i'm<br>going to present are quite challenging<br>to hear<br>um<br>even though it's been a couple of years<br>um since we<br>conducted this research and i have since<br>published it i still come across some of<br>the narratives and they evoke a very<br>strong visceral response for me<br>even though i've been sitting and<br>dwelling with these narratives for some<br>time so i just wanted to warn you that<br>some of these<br>are quite hard narratives to hear<br>and there are a lot of narratives<br>because this isn't my experience this is<br>the experience of the participants<br>who<br>so to be eligible to participate in this<br>study<br>a family had to have a child under the<br>age of two years who had been admitted<br>more than twice with a respiratory<br>illness and the participants<br>that we interviewed<br>were<br>had children admitted between three and<br>ten times<br>at the point at which we interviewed<br>some of them had<br>multiple children that were being<br>repeatedly admitted<br>um<br>so<br>six family groups identified as maori<br>five families were samoan and two were<br>both samoan and tongan<br>and there was one tongan family<br>the people in the study lived with<br>between one and eight adults<br>and<br>with between two and eight children in<br>their homes<br>under the age of five<br>and the interviews were conducted in<br>english<br>and they were transcribed and recorded<br>the analysis of the interviews resulted<br>in<br>not unexpectedly new knowledge<br>about the experience of being in<br>hospital and how families navigated<br>their community<br>when they were<br>when they were had a child who was<br>frequently hospitalized because of lower<br>respiratory infections<br>the key thing when their children first<br>became unwell<br>is that they felt powerless<br>the participants will had<br>um<br>multiple<br>hospital admissions as i mentioned um<br>and when their child first became unwell<br>they faced a new situation they had not<br>previously experienced and they had no<br>knowledge of how to protect their child<br>when reflecting on this all of the<br>participants<br>emotionally recounted their distress<br>during their child's initial illness<br>so i'm going to read the narratives<br>it freaks me out<br>every time he gets sick i think he's<br>going to go<br>and i'm not going to have any have him<br>anymore my boy when he died in my arms<br>he stopped breathing and my brother was<br>trying to bang him on the back to help<br>him breathe<br>but it wasn't working my dad grabbed him<br>and put his mouth to his and sucked out<br>all the mucus and pus and blood up<br>from his throat and we rushed him<br>straight here<br>they were able to observe and comprehend<br>the impact of the illness on their<br>infants and young child but they<br>acknowledged that they were powerless to<br>actually relieve the burden of their<br>child's suffering<br>the impact of watching their child<br>struggle to breathe<br>and the power powerlessness that they<br>felt<br>meant that it introduced fear into the<br>parenting experience<br>they were afraid that they would lose<br>their children<br>and they lived<br>i am just scared i might lose my kids<br>because they're quite young<br>i am just scared because i'm a single<br>mum<br>and there are three<br>when it is hard for them to breathe it<br>just scares me a lot too<br>these early experiences with<br>participants<br>living in fear<br>and having a sense of powerlessness<br>because they couldn't prevent the next<br>round of illness that was coming<br>it is because of me<br>once she starts getting sick i think<br>what day did i not dress her up properly<br>for where we were going she my mother<br>gets angry at me<br>because she hates seeing her come in and<br>out of the hospital<br>they just think it's the way that i<br>dress her<br>sometimes i think they're right<br>participants in this study constantly<br>blamed themselves for their child's<br>illness<br>the lack of agency that they had over<br>their child's well-being meant that they<br>analyzed their parenting behavior and<br>attributed illness to taking their child<br>outside<br>their inability to pay for housing<br>adequate heat<br>and inappropriate clothing<br>in addition the family members also<br>accused them of being poor parents<br>and that just added to the emotional<br>the family<br>all had stories of their experience with<br>the hospital system<br>and also with<br>hospitals<br>and in addition to taking the blame the<br>parents also discussed<br>being at<br>when a child was sick enough to present<br>to hospital the parents quickly realized<br>that things did not always progress<br>smoothly<br>families would present in emergency<br>departments and expect their child to<br>receive the necessary assistant<br>assistance including prompt diagnosis<br>and treatment<br>they spoke of the general lack of<br>understanding of how their<br>child's recurrent illness affected them<br>on a moment-by-moment basis<br>which resulted in feelings of isolation<br>this<br>mother said<br>i need help<br>i call them the nurse and they take too<br>long to respond<br>that is when i get really angry and<br>frustrated<br>getting the extra help to help me look<br>after her<br>i was really exhausted and tired and i<br>asked if i could turn the tv on<br>and the nurse just looked at me and she<br>just started laughing<br>she made me feel really down and out so<br>i just went back into the room and<br>pulled my eyes out<br>again<br>people don't really understand you try<br>and explain them to<br>explain it to them<br>the parents felt powerless to<br>help their child<br>they took the blame<br>and they were also at the mercy of<br>health care professionals treatment of<br>them<br>this resulted in parents describing<br>the families all had stories of their<br>experience with the hospital system<br>and they spoke about the challenge of of<br>having a little control over foreign<br>environment<br>and being at the mercy of health care<br>practitioners skills<br>and attitudes<br>and the hospital was an inhospitable<br>space<br>so in this<br>narrative it was a<br>appearance of a child<br>the mother said when we got to the<br>hospital her oxygen levels were at 92<br>and then half an hour later she was at<br>89.<br>in that time she'd not been given any<br>oxygen she'd not been given any inhalers<br>we could see her health declining<br>you come into a place a hospital where<br>you're actually supposed to look after<br>people<br>and they cannot pick up on the signals<br>of illness in my child when they're<br>there to actually do that<br>if you don't<br>if you don't want to do it give me the<br>tools<br>so that i<br>can<br>do it myself but they would not let me<br>why did we come here to the hospital we<br>could have gotten more here at kfc<br>it's a fast food outlet<br>and here you can see the parents are<br>actually quite knowledgeable they<br>understand oxygen saturation levels they<br>understand exactly<br>what<br>their child needed but because of<br>pressure in the hospital systems<br>the parents weren't able to respond<br>and their parents had to watch their<br>children over<br>over time and they were able to<br>recognize that their daughter was<br>getting sicker and sicker<br>and they they tried to persuade each<br>other to go and seek help from the<br>health professionals but they didn't<br>expect that they would receive<br>any care from the health professionals<br>at that time<br>so they felt powerless to help their<br>daughter<br>they struggled to reconcile the parental<br>knowledge of their child with their<br>ability to recognize the seriousness of<br>our illness<br>against the lack of the response from<br>and it<br>it's interesting because currently our<br>health system is under so much more<br>pressure than when we collected these<br>narratives so an hour wait probably now<br>is a six hour wait<br>um<br>as a side note<br>um<br>the other thing that got impacted<br>is that relationships with partners and<br>family members were also challenged<br>so there were disruptive connections i<br>told him my partner if it gets any worse<br>i'm going to take my son with me<br>and go to my family until he stops<br>smoking<br>i'm looking out for my son's health<br>because he keeps smoking and it does not<br>matter if he smokes outside he comes in<br>and it smells on his clothes and his<br>hands<br>the study participants<br>spoke of how the repeated<br>hospitalizations<br>impacted negatively on their familial<br>and community connections<br>in particular<br>as mentioned before with their partners<br>the frequency with which the families or<br>parents needed to request assistance<br>from extended family also caused stress<br>and meant that<br>parents weren't able to fulfill their<br>they also talked about being separated<br>and the impact that this had<br>over half the participants had more than<br>one child and they all struggled to<br>leave their other child at home<br>this was a mother of eight<br>and she said the kids get really angry<br>because every time<br>they know i'm in hospital they're like<br>ah<br>she's always with her<br>i'm really close with both my boys and<br>my girls but they've and they feel sorry<br>for her that she's in hospital but they<br>also feel like she is taking me away<br>but it's definitely not like that<br>now i have got to be here for her<br>i try and spend as much time as i have<br>with the<br>separation and disrupted normal family<br>functioning<br>was the result<br>of the hospitalizations<br>they were aware the children left at<br>home really struggled emotionally from<br>but over time<br>as they were continually hospitalized<br>what it<br>led to the illnesses<br>and the fear that the participants<br>experienced when their child became sick<br>was a really powerful motivator to try<br>and keep their children well<br>one mother said this i pretty much say<br>no please like can you keep your guys<br>kids on the other side don't bring them<br>over here<br>sounds somewhat like a covered narrative<br>um<br>because i'm scared my son might catch<br>something and then we have to rush back<br>here to hospital<br>because if and everyone at home is<br>cautious with him it's our main problem<br>because every time we see his chest come<br>parents frequently kept their child<br>socially isolated<br>and they progressive um<br>because they understood that the risks<br>of mixing with others meant that they<br>would end up in a hospital again<br>and participants over time gained this<br>knowledge as they considered the events<br>they came to know the signs of<br>respiratory illness<br>and determined the triggers<br>as well<br>and they saw<br>what their child looked like when they<br>were healthy and they recognized them<br>when they were in a downward spiral so<br>that they did their best to<br>intervene before it led to a hospital<br>admission<br>the recognition of the illness<br>trajectory meant that participants<br>learnt how to respond<br>and how the illness progressed when<br>their child became ill<br>despite this knowledge<br>sickness often left to emergency<br>when he's normal he's fine<br>but i know when he is getting sick<br>when he starts this breathing and his<br>wheezing<br>and i know that he has got sick when he<br>starts wheezing i must bring him here to<br>hospital<br>despite this knowledge of the sickness<br>it often led to emergency department<br>visits<br>and once in hospital participants<br>increasingly gained knowledge of the<br>treatment that their children needed<br>they began to know how to respond<br>i look at him and i see he's not really<br>okay<br>the only option is to bring him into<br>hospital<br>that is coming<br>you don't know when it's coming<br>when it comes you have to prepare<br>yourself for what is going to happen<br>next<br>this mother poignantly stated that<br>there's no communicating with an illness<br>and<br>her child's condition announced itself<br>and that signaled the returned hospital<br>although the ability to understand the<br>child's response to the illness<br>and it was crucial<br>and as a result they began to seek<br>treatment sooner<br>they also learned to understand the<br>system<br>when she was first in hospital seeing<br>other nurses tend to her and everything<br>i just stood back<br>and did not really take part in it<br>i just let them do their job<br>but i learned from everything that i had<br>observed<br>kind of took that role upon myself<br>i felt like a nurse and a mother instead<br>of waiting for the nurses i just go<br>at first the hospital environment was<br>unfamiliar for these participants but<br>gradually they appreciated the system<br>technology and treatment and became more<br>at ease<br>in the space<br>and were able to adopt the role of<br>parent-ness<br>which led some of the participants to<br>describe the hospital as a home away<br>from home<br>this mother said this is like a second<br>like we live here because everyone knows<br>i'm here and we're just like it's like<br>we're coming home<br>the grandmother<br>followed on and said yeah we're coming<br>given the number of hospital admissions<br>the parents started to feel<br>comfort in the hospital the stem partly<br>because they were familiar with the<br>staff and the procedures but also<br>because it meant respect for them<br>for their constant vigilance when caring<br>this mother referred to the hospital as<br>a second mortgage which in part might<br>reflect the cost they pay for being in<br>hospital<br>and<br>but they learned to accept that the<br>hospital admissions were a necessary<br>part of keeping their child<br>safe and alive<br>this perspective on admissions allowed<br>families to recast the experience<br>that said the participants all spoke<br>about the fact that they needed to<br>navigate society<br>in order to keep<br>their children safe<br>and there were some narratives that<br>alluded to this earlier<br>all the participants worked really hard<br>to keep their children healthy and safe<br>they used the painful lessons that they<br>had learned from the previous hospital<br>admissions to navigate their way around<br>the risks and to keep their child well<br>they kept their children away from<br>others who might keep them<br>might cause them harm and they attempted<br>to address<br>issues such as poor quality housing<br>which was an issue for almost all the<br>with just five kids in the preschool one<br>cough one child coughed and it went<br>airborne<br>and he caught it and we had to rush him<br>back to hospital we tried again<br>the same thing<br>family start found a maori con<br>correspondents school<br>but it took about four to five months to<br>get him onto the course and they said<br>outings such as going to the grocery<br>store during winter<br>were viewed as a significant threat and<br>again i think covert has really<br>highlighted<br>and shown a light on the impact of<br>repeat hospitalization and<br>but these families worked really hard to<br>keep their children healthy and well<br>but they did discuss how they felt that<br>their lives were on hold because of<br>their child's illness<br>in addition caregivers found<br>in the study frequently discussed issues<br>around employment the financial stress<br>and issues around housing<br>that followed their children's<br>hospitalization when discussing these<br>issues the caregivers often highlighted<br>the long-term repercussions<br>that went on even after the child was<br>back home<br>leaving them with their life being on<br>hold<br>one father offered this narrative<br>my boss<br>has not been too bad so far<br>they've usually been pretty good so far<br>they just ask questions sometimes to<br>make sure that i'm not lying<br>although the father recognized that his<br>boss and his manager was being<br>supportive he understood that he was<br>vulnerable<br>in addition the<br>time the needed time off work to be with<br>a child whilst in hospital<br>meant that frequently parents got let go<br>from<br>their roles because they were too<br>and they struggled even if one person<br>was home looking after the children that<br>person was in a hospital<br>so then they struggled to look after<br>their other children<br>so it became a really stressful part of<br>their lives<br>in addition<br>it led to<br>financial burdens as a result<br>the families in the studies struggled<br>with significant financial burdens<br>because of their repeated admissions<br>some of these burdens resulted in<br>families taking pretty extreme measures<br>to put food on the table and provide<br>clothing for their children<br>and turned to finance companies to<br>support them<br>but they specialized in high-risk loans<br>and that caused other long-term issues<br>it's this is a narrative from one mother<br>it's hard for me especially<br>the children's clothes and foods<br>food i have to bring all of the finance<br>companies i'm dealing with to see if i<br>can<br>do it pay them the next day or next week<br>but the thing is they need all the<br>documents from the hospital to show that<br>i was in hospital so that they're not<br>going to give me arrears<br>it's kind of hard for them to understand<br>i don't know if they're believing me<br>oh well if you love your kids you can do<br>everything for them<br>and the way that this mother handled um<br>informing the finance companies which<br>that she'd take her children on the bus<br>she'd leave one in a hospital take her<br>other two children on the bus go to a<br>local library<br>fax<br>copy you know send the copies of her<br>hospital admissions to the finance<br>companies then travel back on the bus to<br>as a result of the financial struggles<br>there were significant ramifications for<br>our house is cold<br>we've got my nan and my auntie and my<br>cousin in the main house and my uncle in<br>the garage and then us in the back house<br>we do share a room with my cousin and<br>her two kids because she's just moved in<br>there's no insulation the house itself<br>or the roof i would not say it is a warm<br>house<br>dampness especially around the windows<br>he's always snotty quite snotty<br>but the carpet sort of comes and goes<br>he does not always have the cough<br>living in large extended family groups<br>was usual for the participants they<br>spoke a variety of different housing<br>arrangements<br>these types of family living<br>arrangements also meant that families<br>could pull their finances<br>and support each other to maximize the<br>quality of their homes<br>however the participants spoke at length<br>about how challenging their housing<br>arrangements were<br>in relation to keeping their child<br>healthy<br>often they lacked insulation were damp<br>and had no form of heating<br>despite these challenging circumstances<br>the participants made every effort to<br>protect their children and keep them<br>healthy<br>but their lives without illness were<br>still on hold<br>because there were no available<br>resources<br>to remedy the staff the housing<br>participants discussed at length how<br>they knew that housing arrangements were<br>fundamental<br>to their child's health<br>and they worked to keep their houses<br>warm and free of airborne contaminants<br>through remedies and addressing complex<br>family related issues<br>this mother said we've even changed the<br>way we live<br>like the places we sleep<br>me and my son we stay out the back<br>we have even had to make changes to our<br>house we had to get the whole house<br>insulated from earth<br>to bottom<br>to get<br>to getting a heat pump in just to suck<br>out all the bad air so he doesn't<br>breathe in<br>we have even had to stop the way we<br>actually cook<br>because we know it can trigger it<br>the grandmother said we built a new deck<br>just for him a dick for him to come out<br>and play on<br>and a spare room for him we've done all<br>for a number of the participants<br>they were in rental accommodations and<br>had absolutely no control over their<br>housing environment<br>even more at risk<br>however<br>the key thing for these family groups<br>were they or for these participants with<br>a family support<br>and the impact that the extended family<br>had for them<br>in terms of protecting their<br>well-being<br>and managing the challenges that they<br>face with a repeatedly ill child<br>the family do all that for me if i need<br>new clothes or he needs clothes or<br>something we've got my nan and my auntie<br>and my cousin in the main house and then<br>my uncle in the garage<br>and then us in the back house we had<br>however<br>one parent a mother of three preschool<br>children had limited extended family<br>support<br>she suffered significantly because of<br>her child's<br>repeated admissions and was at the mercy<br>of policies forcing her to place her<br>young child alone in an ambulance<br>because they wouldn't let her take her<br>other two children<br>she said this<br>i have to bring my family because once i<br>had to put my son in an ambulance<br>without me<br>and then i have to find who's going to<br>come<br>and look after my kids<br>isn't it funny after all these years i<br>still get choked up<br>because this is a real mother<br>it's a real mother who lives in our<br>community<br>um forgive me<br>um<br>it's not my fault it's my fault for<br>bringing them to life i let the social<br>workers and the doctors know what my<br>situation is<br>it's hard for me because i don't know<br>for families or for mothers without<br>partners and extended family support<br>the experience<br>of a repeated hospitalization was<br>harrowing<br>however where family support exists<br>caregivers ability to respond to illness<br>be in a hospital and navigate society<br>i'm coming to a close<br>but i just wanted to touch on the fact<br>that this is the first type<br>or study of this type globally no one<br>else has looked at the impact on<br>families for repeated hospitalization<br>for respiratory illness<br>despite it being one of the leading<br>causes of hospitalization of children<br>globally<br>participant group included indigenous<br>and minority peoples which again were<br>completely unrepresented in any of the<br>previous research that was done<br>on repeated hospitalizations even in<br>chronic illnesses<br>and it highlights a previously invisible<br>iniquities for members of our community<br>the participant group is small but rich<br>in experience and they were<br>unbelievably<br>generous with us for gifting us<br>so in conclusion<br>and<br>the situations where people are<br>in this predicament<br>the treatment of their children goes<br>beyond immediate illness<br>and the sick child to consider both the<br>family and the systemic issues at play<br>one means of facilitating more<br>hospitable care provision might involve<br>wrap-around support for these children<br>and families if a child is admitted more<br>than once with lower respiratory<br>infection that should trigger health<br>professionals to have a conversation<br>with these families<br>to ask what their needs are<br>and to offer referral to appropriate<br>services<br>want to acknowledge that not all<br>mainstream services are appropriate<br>or will they provide meaningful<br>meaningful support which is what<br>prompted the one mother to say she<br>doesn't want to lose custody of her<br>children<br>in addition<br>in the context of this research in<br>hospitable<br>spaces<br>were places where needs were not met<br>recognized and the voice of those who<br>were caring for the children were<br>actively silenced<br>it is imperative<br>that healthcare professionals recognize<br>the importance of creating different<br>spaces<br>in hospital<br>where they are responsive culturally<br>appropriate<br>and that connections with families are<br>sought<br>caring for a child who is frequently<br>hospitalized during the first two years<br>of life is an extremely challenging<br>experience<br>when these<br>families first<br>experience their first acute illness<br>episode for their child they<br>suffer from<br>they experience helplessness but over<br>time they gain the skills<br>and the experience that they need to<br>participants also learnt how to<br>recognize the illness trajectory and<br>they became the unexpected expert of<br>lower respiratory infections<br>and they were able to<br>seek treatment sooner<br>the process of gradually gaining illness<br>knowledge has been explored within the<br>context of chronic conditions but never<br>for acute care<br>and this study has revealed that the<br>process of coming to know<br>also exists for families<br>for young children suffering from acute<br>illness that is recurrent just as it is<br>for chronically ill children<br>however it doesn't predict this<br>knowledge doesn't protect the<br>participants from experiencing<br>challenges with child care<br>housing financial and employment<br>pressures<br>and these are significant pressures for<br>any family to address whilst remaining<br>constantly vigilant for the next illness<br>episode<br>i want to draw your attention to just<br>the last bullet point on this slide<br>around policy and family provisions<br>it's my challenge to those policy makers<br>and who are in charge of<br>directing these decisions that they open<br>up a funding stream for<br>acute illness episodes that are<br>recurrent during early childhood because<br>if they were provided with the support<br>that chronically ill child children or<br>disabled children have<br>they would not experience quite the same<br>extreme<br>i just want to again acknowledge the<br>research team<br>charissa miller dr adrian trenham dr<br>tara officer who supported this work<br>and te kahui ora maori health whanau<br>order service<br>they supported the analysis of the<br>narratives as well and dr taylor<br>percival<br>also supported the analysis<br>and<br>a variety of other people have also had<br>thank you<br>thank you very much<br>what an amazing presentation thank you<br>uh my name is erson mespau i'm a pro<br>vice chancellor<br>for the faculties of science health<br>engineering architecture and design<br>innovation<br>and it's my great pleasure and i'm<br>delighted to give the vote of thanks to<br>professor karen mike bright henry for<br>tonight's lecture<br>tehrangawaka victoria university of<br>wellington is becoming a true leader an<br>influencer in the field of healthcare<br>systems and policy<br>tonight we have had a glimpse into the<br>brilliant and impressive research<br>that professor mcroyd henry has been<br>undertaking<br>to explore the experiences of parents<br>whose young children have been<br>repeatedly hospitalized with acute<br>respiratory infections<br>to hear how many of these families have<br>found hospitals inhospitable<br>shows just how important crucial and<br>timely this research is to improve these<br>experiences<br>shining a light on what can be<br>incredibly difficult and distressing<br>time<br>has<br>has far-reaching implications in terms<br>of policy health care and ways to manage<br>while families under extended support<br>networks are resilient<br>repeated respiratory english<br>illness in children under two years of<br>age can place significant stress upon<br>their whanau including financial<br>hardship<br>it's clear from professor mike<br>perez-henry's research<br>that more is required for families to<br>thrive<br>including financial support<br>access to social support and flexibility<br>from employers<br>while their children are in hospital<br>canada's lecture<br>reminds us of all the important role<br>universities play not only in addressing<br>social and societal challenges<br>but also<br>in some of the most challenging aspects<br>of people's lives<br>our research changes how our society<br>responds to and supports those who live<br>karen sustained excellence and<br>leadership in this field has<br>significantly contributed to the<br>university's reputation in creating<br>better health systems and policy<br>and in developing a workforce that can<br>do research as well as putting the<br>outcome into practice<br>and create impact beyond university and<br>academic territories<br>that is what we call excellence with<br>purpose<br>and impact in other words karen has<br>effectively translated what she's good<br>at<br>in what she's good for in an amazing way<br>her passion for making the invisible<br>experiences visible<br>is something that will continue to<br>inspire real change and ensure<br>healthcare services truly meet people's<br>real needs<br>she is currently involved in another<br>project looking at the impacts of<br>influenza on children age five or<br>younger<br>which will no doubt have the same<br>life-changing outcomes<br>one of our university's key strengths is<br>preparing our students<br>for the careers and challenges of the<br>future and this is something that karen<br>truly exemplifies<br>her students and colleagues describe her<br>as a guiding light<br>both in terms of helping<br>them navigate its complexities of the<br>research and in cultivating a passion<br>and a culture<br>for making their learning into effective<br>use and make the make the world a better<br>place to live<br>as a passionate teacher researcher and<br>nurse<br>she has been an invaluable asset to our<br>university<br>to our faculty<br>and to the school of nursing midwifery<br>and health practice and an exceptional<br>role model for women in health and<br>academia<br>karen is one of the best jobs that i do<br>as a pro vice chancellor<br>and it is my pleasure to congratulate<br>you on a fantastic inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>i would like to invite you all to join<br>us in the common room outside for some<br>refreshments<br>but first join me again to say thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
