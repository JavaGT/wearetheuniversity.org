this<br>is very exciting and tonight we're we're<br>celebrating<br>simone marshall's promotion to professor<br>and it's it's wonderful to be here<br>for those who don't know me my name is<br>david murdock i'm the vice chancellor of<br>the university<br>and as you're probably<br>aware we've had rather a disrupted<br>program of inaugural professoral<br>lectures over the past two to three<br>years with covert and it's absolutely<br>wonderful<br>to be amongst them again and to have a<br>be able to catch up on what is quite a<br>backlog<br>of lectures<br>um<br>it is actually one of the great<br>pleasures of my of my role to be part of<br>this and and uh i think for<br>simone uh that was actually promoted<br>this year so fortunately hasn't been one<br>of the the people who've had been<br>disrupted by the covert delays<br>i will be<br>handing over<br>to david chica rico to give a more<br>detailed introduction to simone but<br>before then my main job<br>is to welcome everybody and so a big<br>welcome to those who are here<br>those who are watching online those will<br>be watching later on<br>and those from the the wider<br>university community those from the<br>wider dunedin community those from<br>elsewhere<br>but especially some special guests today<br>especially to simone's<br>whanau and friends and i believe<br>that simone's daughter lydia<br>and partner dave<br>great are here today so big big welcome<br>to you and i'm sure there are other<br>people who have<br>contributed to simone's career who are<br>watching this at various times so big<br>welcome to everybody<br>it has become a bit of a tradition at<br>this<br>in the introduction to highlight what an<br>achievement it is<br>uh to receive<br>receive professoral status at the<br>university of otago and<br>i think the main message is that it is a<br>really high bar and<br>i've<br>been an external referee for for quite a<br>few other institutions as i'm sure<br>others have here<br>and uh<br>i i have not encountered a more rigorous<br>process than the<br>process we have here at the university<br>of otago it certainly is a high bar<br>we<br>for those who don't know we<br>require outstanding performance and<br>research service and teaching<br>and importantly for the professorial<br>promotion we require leadership in using<br>more than one area so it is a high bar<br>and uh we all and<br>a big congratulations to simone for a<br>i'm very much looking forward to<br>hearing the lecture today and i'll now<br>pass over to david to give a bit more<br>professor david murdock tenacue<br>professor richard blaikie tanakwe<br>professor helen nicholson<br>tanakwe<br>professor tony valentine<br>tanakwe professor jessica palmer tanakwe<br>dave<br>daisy marshall<br>i also want to<br>um acknowledge the prior inhabitants of<br>this land taiwai panama<br>and express my gratitude to manafenoua<br>tangata fenua and subsequent pakia for<br>allowing me to make aotero new zealand<br>my adopted home<br>has a sword<br>that's right she's a swords person and i<br>say this not because i want you to fear<br>her she is in fact among the most<br>approachable<br>educators i know<br>i say this because just like any other<br>tool adopted by the human animal<br>this serves as an extension of herself<br>and in this case in this context<br>it's an extension of her scholarly<br>identity and in turn her passion for<br>what she does<br>swords and dragons are part and parcel<br>of medieval studies<br>simone does not<br>have a dragon property services have<br>deemed this a fire hazard<br>as simone puts it in her own mission<br>statement i want to build a community<br>of research expertise<br>train a new generation<br>of medievalists<br>and reveal the stories and secrets<br>medieval<br>manuscripts contain<br>that's<br>drive<br>that's vision<br>professor simone marshall has a quill<br>she's a calligrapher and she teaches a<br>lost art she learned calligraphy from<br>her father just as my own mother an<br>artist and art teacher for over six<br>decades taught me and my brother's<br>calligraphy when we were growing up<br>it's probably a lost art for me by now<br>more broadly i'm immensely proud of the<br>fact that our department continues to<br>rewrite<br>history<br>the history of women authors and other<br>marginalized writers from medieval to<br>digital culture<br>in fact the reality is our work has much<br>in common<br>if we ascribe to the gutenberg<br>parenthesis<br>theory<br>this idea that texts were both<br>more open and fluid<br>both after<br>and before the printing press and the<br>before they were bound up in these<br>then we would have more in common<br>than i perhaps would with the rest of<br>you<br>myopic prince-centric bibliophiles<br>for example chaucer's writing quite<br>fits quite comfortably among the sort of<br>texts that circulate in today's digital<br>culture his best known work was of<br>course a rather character<br>centric collection of narratives<br>which might be akin to the kind of<br>modular or micro narratives that<br>characterize digital textuality the fact<br>that the canonical order<br>of the canterbury tales is debated to<br>this day might even gesture toward the<br>texts inherently multi-linear or<br>multi-threaded<br>nature and given chaucer's celebrated<br>use of the vernacular i think he would<br>also be right behind the democratizing<br>or communitizing influence of digital<br>writing environments<br>but as this revisionist digital literary<br>reading of chaucer might<br>as it goes it must go along with other<br>post-colonial feminist<br>cross-cultural and globalizing readings<br>readings that continue to question canon<br>simone's work exemplifies<br>such an undertaking<br>and it makes me look forward to and i<br>in her first book the female voice in<br>the assembly of ladies text and context<br>in 15th century england puts into<br>practice uh<br>to use her own phrase a much needed<br>subversion of the anti-feminist<br>tradition<br>the second book titled<br>the anonymous text gave us insight into<br>that great yet every elusive literary<br>genius we all know as<br>more specifically it treated the concept<br>of anonymity as a rhetorical strategy in<br>works<br>of<br>medieval literature<br>her research has been featured<br>in a bbc radio series on the history of<br>literary anonymity<br>she's done interviews for radio new<br>zealand national and her chaucer<br>discovery featured in our very own odt<br>more recently she's undertaken<br>collaborations with scholars overseas<br>that cast a critical eye<br>over the connections between what some<br>might see as her inescapably ancient<br>field<br>and many of the persistent and indeed<br>pernicious contemporary narratives that<br>have circulated in the aftermath of the<br>christ church mosque shootings<br>over the years simone has had<br>responsibility for some of our largest<br>and most unwieldy writing papers<br>i've had the pleasure of teaching with<br>her in one relatively new creative<br>writing paper english 120 how to<br>captivate and persuade<br>where she wowed first year students with<br>epic travel narratives and then inspired<br>them to write their own<br>she has worked tirelessly in her role of<br>associate dean academic<br>and provided me with guidance on some of<br>the finer points of university<br>regulations in my role as head i'm most<br>for simone<br>the pen<br>or quill<br>need not be mightier than the sword the<br>pen and the sword are mighty<br>in equal measure<br>and they both index a scholar at the top<br>of her game noreda tenacoto tenekoto<br>tenetauto katoa please join me in<br>everyone thank you so much for coming<br>out tonight i really really do<br>appreciate to see you all here it's just<br>just wonderful<br>i would like to thank professor murdock<br>for your lovely introduction and i'd<br>also like to thank my colleague<br>david chukariko for your words i really<br>i've given my talk<br>the title this evening of<br>the good scribe<br>because it gives me the opportunity<br>to present to you some very detailed<br>examples of the research that i do<br>but also at the same time<br>it allows me the opportunity to present<br>some broad ideas as well to to think<br>about the relevance of where my research<br>fits into the wider world<br>now the good scribe<br>is the title of what will be my sixth<br>book when i finish it<br>but it occurred as a result the title<br>that is occurred as a result of an<br>interesting experience<br>so my research is in medieval english<br>literature and i am now the only person<br>working in a new zealand university in<br>this field<br>and what that means of course is that<br>most of my colleagues in my research<br>field are elsewhere in the world<br>we make a very good community there's a<br>lot of support and we<br>have a lot of conversations they occur<br>not surprisingly mostly online and often<br>via social media<br>so<br>one on one particular occasion fairly<br>recently one of my colleagues who is uh<br>in norway<br>posted this<br>this image online<br>to share with colleagues to say<br>i think i found a new poem that no one<br>else has identified before<br>which you can imagine created<br>quite a bit of interest among those of<br>us working in the field<br>i should stress though that this is not<br>unheard of<br>and i often describe my research as<br>being a little bit like the da vinci<br>code but without the car chases<br>because when analyzing manuscripts it's<br>actually not unusual to discover<br>something that no one else has seen<br>before<br>although it's not usually quite as<br>dramatic as<br>and revealing as the movies might<br>suggest<br>anyway<br>she discovered something that um had<br>probably never been noticed before and<br>if you're having a little difficulty<br>just reading that i have helpfully<br>written it out for you here and it says<br>delight not in those books which are<br>both vice and vain but exercise thyself<br>it's a very nice little couplet i think<br>i don't think we'd disagree with the<br>sentiment that it contains<br>now the conversation from my colleagues<br>that um<br>uh evolved as a result of seeing this<br>was um well it brought up all sorts of<br>different things so there is the<br>possibility that it was likely written<br>by a professional scribe<br>that it's probably written by a man<br>it's certainly written by someone who's<br>right-handed and that it's probably 16th<br>century and all of this is very<br>interesting in itself<br>but what really stayed with me among the<br>conversations about this little extract<br>was<br>one person's comment that this was<br>written by a good scribe<br>now of course that could mean any number<br>of things<br>but it caught my attention because my<br>first reaction to the image was<br>what a hell of a mess<br>i was not at all impressed<br>so<br>working with medieval manuscripts is one<br>of the skills that the medievalist needs<br>to be able to do<br>it means being able to read a range of<br>languages recognizing paleographical<br>features in the handwriting to help<br>identify when and where the text was<br>written<br>and identifying code ecological elements<br>about how the manuscript was made and<br>how that might contribute to what it<br>means<br>it's a bit of detective work and it's<br>where i get to pretend that i'm indiana<br>jones and i think it's rather thrilling<br>and exciting<br>now<br>i've got to say that i'm i'm so pleased<br>that dave and lydia are here tonight<br>it's wonderful though i do have to admit<br>that lydia is possibly not quite so<br>convinced that my work is either<br>anyway in this particular instance i<br>realized that i bring something else to<br>the study of medieval manuscripts that<br>so when i was 11 years old<br>dave has rather stolen david has rather<br>stolen my thunder here<br>when i was 11 years old my father<br>started teaching me calligraphy<br>and so when i look at this page<br>and particularly the first word delight<br>i see it from the calligrapher's point<br>of view<br>and this does not strike me as a<br>particularly good example of writing<br>so i'm going to try and do a little bit<br>of magic here tonight<br>i know i'm tempting fate but i'm going<br>to try it anyway<br>and what i want to show you<br>is i just want to<br>give you some examples of<br>what<br>what it was that irked me so much about<br>this word delight so when i started<br>learning calligraphy i recall writing<br>page after page of the letter a<br>the letter a just like that<br>followed by another a<br>and yet another a<br>and on and on it went<br>this is my first introduction to<br>calligraphy<br>and i can tell you that i got<br>increasingly frustrated with the whole<br>process because it felt as though i<br>could never get my a's consistent with<br>and<br>perhaps each a looked okay within itself<br>but it never looked like the previous a<br>and it never looked like the next day<br>and i could very quickly see even from<br>the very start of learning calligraphy<br>that that was the aim that consistency<br>is what i was<br>trying to achieve here<br>so<br>it was a little bit frustrating i'd like<br>to think with what i've done there<br>tonight i may have improved a little bit<br>from when i was 11 but i can i can still<br>see the floors they're still there so as<br>an 11 year old this frustrated me i<br>remember thinking how on earth am i<br>going to make it through the entire<br>alphabet i can't even manage the letter<br>a this is going to take a lifetime<br>now of course i didn't realize at the<br>time that i was practicing the letter a<br>that in fact i was also practicing<br>and an e<br>and then no we're not going through the<br>alphabet<br>g<br>and p and q<br>and i hope what you can see is that<br>what i discovered while i'm practicing<br>the letter a is i'm practicing all of<br>the rounded letters all of them at the<br>same time okay all of the ones that have<br>a rounded shape there's some variations<br>of course but um<br>in fact what i discovered was it didn't<br>take me quite so long to get through the<br>entire alphabet as i had feared it might<br>because i was practicing these letters<br>all along<br>and similarly<br>when i then started practicing the<br>letter i which is surprisingly difficult<br>you know to actually get a straight<br>vertical line that doesn't go all over<br>the place<br>but practicing the letter i i was also<br>inadvertently practicing<br>the letter j<br>and the letter<br>and a t<br>all requiring the same the same skill<br>okay<br>um<br>and i should add that there are all<br>sorts of combinations that one might use<br>as a calligrapher to to help<br>work on exactly that one particular<br>feature that consistency that one is<br>attempting so one might try for instance<br>this has got to be my best party piece<br>writing the word minimum it's a fabulous<br>there are some other tricks and<br>techniques involved in writing that but<br>really what i'm trying to point out to<br>you is<br>some certain things that help to<br>convince you that it's consistent okay<br>so aiming for the same height with all<br>of the upright letters um<br>aiming for the same uh for each of the<br>upright uh uh strokes which are called<br>minims um to be exactly vertical<br>aiming for the<br>not so much the width of the letter<br>because of course an m is inherently<br>wider than an i for instance but really<br>looking at the gaps between each of the<br>minims now you can see i haven't really<br>managed that exactly right but it's<br>close enough that your eye sort of fills<br>in the in the gaps and makes up for any<br>flaws in the writing<br>okay so we're aiming for that kind of<br>consistency uh in in the lettering and<br>that is what attracts the eye that's<br>what makes it um<br>a pleasant thing to look at if that<br>makes sense<br>okay<br>so when i then looked at the piece of<br>writing in the manuscript<br>i'm hoping that you can see why i<br>thought it was awful<br>the calligrapher of me was seeing that<br>this scribe had in fact<br>made a terrible mistake<br>this scribe had in fact used the wrong<br>quill<br>now i'm going to have a go<br>i'm really tempting fate here i'm going<br>to have a go at trying to replicate that<br>word that delight<br>just so we can see exactly what it is<br>and why why<br>something like that it's got a few<br>i'm not quite sure what they were<br>a few<br>little lines and some dots<br>i don't like it very much at all<br>but then we get to<br>there's a big swooshy thing there<br>now<br>i<br>it's very kind of you to applaud my<br>terrible writing<br>i mean i will say that i think i've done<br>an okay job replicating what is there i<br>still think it looks terrible<br>and i'm hoping you'll agree with me that<br>it it doesn't look attractive you may or<br>may not know why you think it it's not<br>attractive so<br>what i want to just<br>try and explain here is<br>one of the fundamentals of calligraphy<br>is that there is an optimum height<br>of a letter according to the width of<br>the pin that is used<br>and<br>in this case<br>the the<br>scribe has<br>attempted to write some very tall<br>letters with a pen that is actually too<br>narrow<br>okay um<br>it absolutely is possible to choose to<br>do that deliberately um to make<br>lettering particularly tall or<br>particularly short or for whatever<br>artistic reason<br>but there is a sort of a comfortable<br>window<br>of height according to the width of the<br>pen that<br>allows for all sorts of marvelous things<br>it allows you to to be a great deal more<br>consistent with your lettering or at<br>least to hide some inconsistencies<br>and it is<br>far more aesthetically pleasing so i'm<br>going to have a go now at rewriting this<br>because it's offending me to even look<br>at it<br>i'll try and rewrite it and<br>hopefully with a better height for the<br>size of the pen that i'm using tonight<br>i'm just getting a bit carried away you<br>know<br>and i'll put the e on the end because<br>that's what our scribe has done<br>look it's<br>it's a little better isn't it surely<br>um<br>there are still all sorts of<br>inconsistencies in my lettering there<br>absolutely they are there but they are<br>far less visible far less obvious<br>because the height of the letter is<br>better suited to the width of the pen<br>that i'm using tonight it obscures any<br>of those<br>errors imperfections slight wobbles or<br>and so forth you can see back over in<br>this one here<br>getting all of my minims absolutely<br>vertical becomes so much harder<br>when uh when i'm trying to make them<br>extremely long so much easier when the<br>lettering is a little bit shorter<br>okay now<br>i'll just<br>a tiny side note here you will note that<br>i have been using the terms pin and<br>quill interchangeably here<br>i even brought some props for us tonight<br>that's a feather<br>it is a feather let me see there we go<br>it's a real real live feather it's a<br>peacock feather<br>this is quill<br>right here<br>okay and i know i may be breaking your<br>heart because you may well be wishing<br>that a quill looked like it did in the<br>movies with a great big plume of and and<br>it's lovely and exciting but i'm afraid<br>a medieval quill does not look like that<br>and he's a nice famous example of a<br>medieval illustration of a scribe at<br>work and you can see what he's holding<br>in his right hand it looks like that it<br>looks like a pen<br>because it is<br>okay so using the word the term quill or<br>pen really it's not inappropriate to to<br>think of them as interchangeable things<br>just out of interest<br>in his left hand you'll see that our<br>scribe is holding a knife<br>and in this case he's using the knife to<br>hold down the paper the page or whatever<br>it is he's writing on the surface<br>to stop it from moving to stop it from<br>buckling while he's writing with his<br>right hand<br>but that knife he will have used to cut<br>his quill in the first place to cut it<br>to the right shape potentially if it<br>needs re-cutting he can redo that<br>as he's going along and of course that<br>is where we get the term pen knife how<br>about that everyone<br>i know you should all be going oh<br>look at that<br>slip that into a conversation this week<br>i think you should um how you know what<br>a p my pen knife is so called<br>okay<br>so the question is back to my word<br>delight why did our scribe do this<br>my colleagues who suggested that this<br>was a good scribe have identified some<br>important um characteristics here he is<br>indeed well practiced and indeed if you<br>look at the rest of the lettering<br>there we go all along here it really is<br>very quick very consistent the height of<br>the lettering is pretty much the same<br>all the way through<br>there are if you look at that h there<br>it's wonderful and then all the other<br>h's that have these lovely little<br>swooshy things on them again that's<br>another technical term um<br>you know these are consistent within<br>themselves this is a really well<br>you can tell from the h's and all the y<br>and that h there at the bottom that this<br>has also been written quite quickly<br>which is another sign of confidence it's<br>written quickly um you can tell because<br>the that final stroke is slightly wider<br>than the<br>other strokes of the letters which<br>occurs when you put a bit more pressure<br>on the page and that happens when you're<br>going a little bit faster<br>so otherwise a really competent<br>professional scribe here<br>so<br>my colleagues have said this is a good<br>scribe and identified all these<br>characteristics i i absolutely agree<br>with them but what they've said<br>in no way addresses the elephant in the<br>room<br>which is the the enormous word delight<br>looking so awful<br>okay and so what i think is that this<br>shows something more indeed our<br>professional our scribe is a<br>professional i'm sure he is probably a<br>man<br>he is almost certainly right-handed but<br>he is not an artist<br>writing is a job that he does he copies<br>documents for a living and indeed on<br>another page of this manuscript i have<br>this right here i'm sorry it's not a<br>very easy page to look at but you can<br>see from it that this same scribe has<br>used up all the available space in the<br>margins to just try out as many<br>different<br>letters as possible you can see that<br>and uh yeah and and in fact what he's<br>doing he's not just practicing letters<br>he's practicing writing them quickly<br>because that's a huge asset being able<br>to write documents very quickly<br>so<br>it could be that our scribe didn't have<br>the right size quill<br>to hand to do that lettering that's<br>possible or perhaps he didn't have the<br>means to recut his quill to the right<br>size<br>right at that moment when he needed it<br>or maybe he didn't even realize that he<br>needed a different sized quill for this<br>particular work<br>to me this looks like a professional<br>scribe having a go at writing something<br>a little bit fancy and not really<br>knowing how to do it<br>it it really shows to me that there are<br>two very different types of scribes<br>that operate at this time the very<br>functional professional scribe who<br>simply copies<br>documents very quickly for<br>whatever purpose and the more creative<br>artistic scribe who would be far more<br>practiced at<br>decorative writing<br>okay<br>there we go<br>this is a tiny insight into a tiny part<br>of my research<br>this is what i do i use the skills of<br>paleography of codecology<br>languages and in my case calligraphy<br>to read early manuscripts and say why i<br>think they're important<br>now you may be thinking that you're not<br>finding this one scribes if it's<br>particularly important to you<br>so i'll try and give you another example<br>hopefully to convince you um<br>as i've said reading medieval books we<br>almost always reveal<br>encounter something that we've never<br>found before<br>so i think it's already been mentioned<br>tonight<br>a few years ago i made a discovery<br>of an entire edition of the works of<br>geoffrey chaucer<br>that nobody seems to have known about<br>how does that even happen<br>it's 14 volumes<br>now that was pretty exciting and it is a<br>pretty important discovery too because<br>it has helped us to show how chaucer the<br>father of english poetry has been valued<br>at different times and in different<br>societies<br>now um<br>you can see just how much i've been able<br>to say tonight about a single word so<br>you can just imagine how much i could<br>say about 14 volumes<br>but you'll be pleased to know that<br>that's not going to happen because we'd<br>be here all night<br>this is a convenient segue onto other<br>things<br>okay um<br>let me tell you a little bit about<br>how i ended up here<br>so i told you about how my father taught<br>me calligraphy and how frustrating this<br>was<br>my father taught himself calligraphy<br>having been trained initially as a<br>cartographer and an architectural<br>draftsman back when these were things<br>that were done by hand<br>he first came to new zealand from india<br>as part of an agreement between his<br>school and the new zealand government<br>which is a story that has been<br>wonderfully researched and told by dr<br>jane mccabe in her<br>history phd thesis and her later books<br>on the subject and you should go and<br>have a look at them because they're<br>wonderful if there's one thing that i'm<br>really enjoying about tonight it's that<br>this gives me a lovely opportunity to<br>showcase new scholars work<br>so i suppose the story of an orphaned<br>indian boy ending up in new zealand<br>teaching himself calligraphy is the<br>perfect example of the ways in which the<br>british empire flung itself flung itself<br>out to the extremities of the globe<br>to then be internalized by those<br>colonised<br>becoming more british than the british<br>i'm sure we can probably all come up<br>with<br>a range of other examples of this but<br>that's my my personal example and it's<br>my entry point into medieval literature<br>now i do realize that i have skipped a<br>great deal between my 11 year old self<br>and then me turning up here at otago so<br>i will very quickly fill in the blanks<br>for you<br>i went to victoria university<br>where i studied theater and english and<br>i worked very briefly in theatre and<br>film in wellington<br>performance is a family trait my uncle<br>is the ballet dancer sir john trimmer<br>and both of my parents were dancers and<br>i was also for a time<br>i traveled for a fair bit going to india<br>several times to see where my father had<br>grown up<br>and i then decided that my brain was<br>turning to mush<br>so i returned to university and uh this<br>time to waikato<br>to study medieval literature with<br>professor alexandra barrett who is still<br>to this day possibly the most formidable<br>person i know and i know some of you<br>here do know her and i think you would<br>agree with me<br>from here i went to sydney university to<br>complete my phd before arriving in otago<br>and<br>one of the attractions<br>of dunedin was our or is our world-class<br>collection of medieval manuscripts<br>one of the things that i like to do<br>whenever i meet somebody new here<br>is to slip into the conversation did you<br>know<br>that dunedin has the largest collection<br>of medieval manuscripts in the southern<br>hemisphere and almost always the person<br>doesn't know this and so i launch into a<br>very detailed description of our<br>collections<br>and did you know this<br>did you you didn't know well let me tell<br>you all about them then<br>at our university library<br>our very own university library at our<br>dunedin public art gallery selwyn<br>college and knox college and the dunedin<br>public library<br>we have dozens of medieval manuscripts<br>and fragments of manuscripts dating<br>right from the 10th century that have<br>been collected and donated over the<br>years they've all been catalogued some<br>have even been digitized and<br>if you<br>admire the ones that have come<br>particularly from the dunedin public<br>library they've just launched their<br>collection of manuscripts having been<br>digitized which is very exciting<br>but very little research has been done<br>on them to say where they're from what<br>they are who owns them and why they are<br>important<br>so<br>these collections highlight dunedin as a<br>a center for the study of medieval<br>manuscripts and eat early books and as<br>i'll explain in a moment in the<br>development and growth of english as a<br>discipline<br>so i'm going to take us back in time for<br>just a moment<br>to look at where this discipline came<br>from and it's quite interesting because<br>it involves otago university a great<br>deal<br>so the study of english<br>as a university discipline originates<br>mostly in the 19th century<br>and in fact otago university was one of<br>the first universities in the world to<br>teach english literature<br>after only glasgow and edinburgh<br>the focus of english at edinburgh and<br>glasgow was a little different from what<br>we might think of english as today their<br>focus was really on rhetoric and<br>composition and the utilitarian aspects<br>of writing skills<br>otago<br>the third university to teach english<br>drew on some of the elements from<br>glasgow and edinburgh but it was also<br>influenced by a scholarly trend that was<br>only just emerging at the time which is<br>german philology<br>the universities of berlin and<br>strasbourg<br>both established professors of english<br>philology in 1872 so just after otago<br>university had begun<br>now i know that there are some of you<br>here who have heard me mention this on<br>other occasions but i'm going to do it<br>again which is to tell you about the<br>very first lectures given at otago<br>university the very first lectures<br>given at otago university by george sale<br>who was the professor of classics were<br>in fact on medieval literature<br>in the otago daily times from 1871<br>it reports sales stating that his<br>students would begin with chaucer's<br>canterbury tales before moving on to<br>shakespeare<br>he reportedly disliked the utilitarian<br>approach that he saw at glasgow in<br>edinburgh<br>and he seemed to think that the study of<br>classical and medieval texts was a<br>really valuable<br>was really valuable for the development<br>of men in the new colony<br>and so he seemed to think that there was<br>very practical benefit<br>studying english and classical<br>literature now incidentally<br>both auckland university college and<br>canterbury college followed suit a few<br>years after<br>otago where their first professors were<br>professors of both english and classics<br>now i'm going to throw in a little we<br>aside solely because it's really<br>interesting and unusual um the<br>canterbury you know uh college professor<br>of english and classics who is john<br>mcmillan brown and some of you may be<br>familiar with him as the grandfather of<br>james k baxter<br>john macmillan brown actually filled in<br>for a year at otago university in 1920<br>after the unexpected death of professor<br>thomas gilroy gilroy<br>who died<br>in the middle of delivering a lecture<br>the year before<br>so apparently macmillan brown refused to<br>take his salary for the year that he was<br>here at otago and that was later used to<br>create the macmillan brown prize that we<br>still award in english today<br>how about that i just think that's<br>really fascinating<br>so<br>otago university was<br>one of the first to teach english<br>literature in the world and was very<br>likely the first to teach medieval<br>but it does also mean that otago<br>university and the study of medieval<br>english literature we're very much bound<br>up in the colonial mentality and this<br>has been a feature of medieval english<br>studies around the world even in my own<br>education the study of medieval english<br>literature was a compulsory part<br>of a major in english and elsewhere in<br>the world that is still a requirement to<br>to study<br>medieval literature or history of the<br>english language because it's seen as a<br>as an integral part of how to study<br>english<br>now don't get me wrong i'm not saying<br>that's a bad thing and i'm not<br>advocating for the abolishing of<br>medieval literature<br>but i do feel that the motivations for<br>teaching medieval literature have<br>remained embedded in the colonial<br>mentality<br>there still seems to be an undercurrent<br>that implies one should learn medieval<br>literature in order to be a good citizen<br>now of course scholars worldwide have<br>recognized this and have made really<br>important and valuable efforts to<br>reconsider<br>where english literature fits today and<br>indeed how it fits into a modern world<br>medieval literary studies has been a<br>little slower to respond to this but i<br>am pleased to see that we now talk about<br>global medieval studies and it<br>recognises that other literatures and<br>other cultures<br>do exist indeed<br>around the world<br>now this is not to say that it's been an<br>easy transition and in fact there are<br>those who have fought tooth and nail to<br>try and stop change<br>dismissing modern re-evaluations of<br>medieval literature and one example that<br>you may find interesting and rather<br>unfortunately amusing<br>is an instance of the academic<br>organization the international<br>anglo-saxon society<br>which has recently changed its name to<br>the international society for the study<br>of early medieval england<br>there were accusations of racism and<br>bullying and it was really quite awful<br>but the society has addressed this i<br>think really making a very genuine<br>effort but<br>amidst this there was also a curious<br>increase in the membership of the<br>society<br>now an academic society in the<br>humanities might welcome an increase in<br>membership after all we are all trying<br>to attract a wider interest to the value<br>of the humanities<br>but unfortunately in this case the<br>interests seem to be coming from<br>us-based white supremacist groups<br>misunderstanding the purpose of the<br>society<br>nevertheless change is happening and<br>again this is another opportunity for me<br>to really showcase some of the new<br>younger scholars coming through<br>um<br>because<br>what i want to highlight now is one<br>particular instance right here in new<br>zealand that i just can't praise highly<br>enough<br>this is uh dr maddie williams book which<br>was published last year<br>pacific 900 to 1600 and it's a<br>re-evaluation<br>that we've really really needed in<br>medieval studies<br>this book considers south pacific<br>communities<br>in aotearoa kohu and rapa nui bringing<br>to the fore cultural elements that to<br>many in new zealand may not be new at<br>all<br>but we are really not the intended<br>audience for this book because williams<br>also compares these cultures to medieval<br>european cultures particularly viking<br>movements during this time frame<br>so the audience<br>for this book is medieval studies<br>scholars elsewhere in the world and it<br>puts pacific cultures alongside european<br>cultures in a way that's really long<br>overdue<br>um for instance one of the myths that<br>the uh of the medieval european world<br>that<br>i have to say has largely come from the<br>19th century i'm quite keen on blaming<br>the 19th century for a lot of things um<br>is the view that medieval people didn't<br>travel<br>no it's not true of course people<br>traveled across europe to asia<br>south into africa<br>across to north america but<br>no one in europe was traveling across<br>open water with the sophisticated<br>navigational tools like polynesian<br>peoples<br>and these are the sorts of comparisons<br>that williams is making in her book and<br>it's so important that we recognize this<br>to help redress that balance<br>incidentally i'll be working with dr<br>mary williams in the coming year as we<br>prepare to co-host the australian and<br>new zealand association of medieval and<br>early modern scholars conference in 2024<br>which will be co-hosted at canterbury<br>and otago universities<br>the reason being that of course otago is<br>the university that has the resources<br>for this so you can look out for that<br>all right<br>so<br>despite being the only scholar studying<br>medieval english literature in a new<br>zealand university<br>now is not the time to give up on the<br>field now is the time to show what<br>medieval studies can really mean here<br>right here right in the bottom of the<br>pacific and in fact right here at otago<br>university is the best place to be doing<br>this<br>i've mentioned already our amazing<br>european resources at our university<br>library and selwyn and knox colleges the<br>public art gallery and the public<br>library but of course we also have<br>the 500 year old waka recovered at<br>papanui inlet some years ago so this is<br>really the place where that needs to<br>happen that that reevaluation<br>i would love for more people to join<br>with me and and to contribute to this<br>effort so while we can but while we can<br>research<br>and write plenty of scholarly and<br>articles and books and so on i actually<br>think it's far more important that we<br>engage with the public<br>and there are unfortunately some<br>consequences when we don't do that well<br>so in christchurch the mosque shooting<br>from 2019 we all know about the horror<br>of the shooter broadcasting live on<br>social media<br>at the start of that broadcast he<br>proudly displayed his cache of weapons<br>that he was to use<br>and painted on his weapons you may<br>recall were the names of various<br>medieval crusaders because he was<br>convinced that we should be returning to<br>some sort of former age in which<br>european white culture reigned supreme<br>of course that age never existed it's<br>not true at all but it is a view that<br>medieval studies has at times<br>inadvertently helped to promote over the<br>generations<br>and unfortunately this is not the first<br>time this has happened here either<br>my former colleague associate professor<br>greg waite who um<br>had an<br>instance in 1990 when um<br>he was called by the police to assist in<br>their investigation into david gray<br>after the ara moana shooting that some<br>of you will remember i'm sure<br>and this was because grey's house<br>contained medieval norse material<br>so i'm afraid it has happened before and<br>i do feel like medievalists do need to<br>do better at how we communicate with the<br>public that we don't inadvertently<br>elevate european culture as somehow more<br>important or more valuable than any<br>other culture and that we bring other<br>cultures to the fore<br>so i've mentioned that i would love more<br>people to come and research with me in<br>my field i can't do it all myself<br>and there really are so many<br>opportunities to make a real difference<br>in our society and worldwide<br>so i'm going to share with you some of<br>the research projects that are underway<br>and happening right as we speak<br>so<br>one project here that has waited nearly<br>three years to get underway due to our<br>water closures but it's going to happen<br>it really is and i'm quite thrilled<br>i'm going to be working with professor<br>hannah johnson from the university of<br>pittsburgh<br>on this project deadly words muslims<br>jews and witches in the first era of<br>fake news so in this project we're<br>looking at how modern perceptions of<br>medieval european culture has been<br>misused and misinterpreted today drawing<br>on examples from the 2019 christchurch<br>mosque shooting and also the 2018<br>pittsburgh synagogue shooting<br>so our plan though is<br>not to write yet another academic tone<br>which will be read by maybe five people<br>including our mothers<br>but rather to write a book for general<br>readership and to create a podcast that<br>can bring that material into a public<br>domain because that's really where the<br>information needs to be<br>i'm also lucky enough to work with my<br>wonderful collaborator<br>former phd student dr roberto suazo<br>gomes<br>on a project literature and nationalism<br>the mythologising of chaucer and<br>cervantes<br>because of course the colonial<br>tendencies that encompass english<br>literature occurred in spanish<br>literature too and in the<br>spanish-speaking world<br>you can also look out for<br>making the medieval book which is a very<br>exciting collaboration that i'm doing<br>with the otago arts society the dunedin<br>public library the hawken library and<br>the otago university library and it's a<br>creative<br>collaboration with local artists i'm a<br>little nervous because it's a bit<br>outside what i'd normally do but it's<br>very exciting<br>and finally as uh has been mentioned i'm<br>also writing a biography of geoffrey<br>chaucer which i've entitled fabricating<br>the life of chaucer um it's intended for<br>a general readership rather than a<br>scholarly readership and it definitely<br>asks why do we need another biography of<br>chaucer i mean really we don't know that<br>much about him so how much more is there<br>to say<br>but my answer is going to be that i'm<br>actually going to look at biography it's<br>a biography of other biographies i'm<br>looking at other people's biographies of<br>chaucer<br>in order to show how chaucer has been<br>used as a vehicle for imperialism even<br>and i want to mention at this point my<br>wonderful postgraduate students who have<br>developed such amazing research projects<br>and who have created such fascinating<br>collaborations across the university i<br>want to mention this because<br>in a situation where i'm otherwise<br>isolated on my own these collaborations<br>have really shown to me<br>how much more widely<br>my research can be applicable to to<br>other disciplines so for instance i have<br>had the pleasure of working with dr<br>catherine hall in the otago medical<br>school on medieval monstrosity and<br>territology<br>with dr gwyneth mcintyre in classics<br>looking at the influence of classical<br>literature on medieval literature<br>with professor leah mcelveney in<br>scottish studies looking at medieval<br>scottish poetry and most recently uh<br>professor greg dawes in<br>religious studies on a project on early<br>embroideries in the church in new<br>zealand<br>and beyond the university as well with<br>dr jane malthus who is a fashion<br>historian um and an honorary curator at<br>the otago museum<br>looking at classical and medieval fabric<br>manufacturer you can see the<br>possibilities are really quite extensive<br>here<br>very quickly before i finish i do want<br>to mention<br>a few colleagues across new zealand and<br>around the world who have<br>continued to provide so much<br>encouragement and support so associate<br>professor chris jones from canterbury<br>university um who i've worked with on a<br>number of projects and most recently you<br>may have seen on tv because it was so<br>exciting um the work that he's done on<br>the wicked bible and at canterbury<br>quite thrilling you'll have to go and<br>look it up um professors kim phillips<br>and tracy adams at auckland university<br>professor carol kuzak from the<br>university of sydney and professor mary<br>flannery from the university of bern and<br>there are so many more people that i<br>could mention who have and who continue<br>to<br>make such a difference to my research it<br>really means that um so much when i'd<br>otherwise<br>be researching in a fairly isolated<br>situation<br>we've made it we're at the end<br>and so i really hope that you found this<br>glimpse into my research tonight<br>interesting<br>it's been a real pleasure for me to<br>share all of this with you so thank you<br>very much everyone<br>humanities at the university of otago<br>and i have the great privilege of giving<br>the vote of thanks to simone i was<br>listening to an interview this afternoon<br>while i was in the middle of dropping<br>kids off and trying to get back to work<br>and you know the things that modern-day<br>female academics do right<br>and the interview was on um national<br>radio and it was a psychologist from<br>auckland university who was bemoaning<br>what he saw as the loss amongst our<br>students of important intellectual<br>skills<br>of consideration analysis and synthesis<br>because they no longer write by hand in<br>classes<br>granted i'm sure that many of us in this<br>room and online will have a view of the<br>truth or otherwise of that claim but it<br>got me wondering how one would prove<br>this<br>and i think that someone has done that<br>she's done that this evening<br>very well she's a calligrapher she's an<br>academic<br>she's a scholar<br>and she showed us<br>through her use of calligraphy which i<br>think is probably the epitome of the<br>craft of freehand uh just how talented<br>she is and in doing so she demonstrated<br>superior skills of consideration<br>analysis and synthesis through her<br>research so bravo simone it was lovely<br>to see i i think you'll all agree with<br>me that she has delivered<br>a beautiful lecture not just an<br>interesting one but a beautiful one she<br>weaved in tales of her own story of her<br>father's story of otago's story<br>of her various research projects and of<br>recent events that all shine light on<br>her discipline of medieval english<br>literature<br>and being the only one in university<br>known to aotearoa doing this i think<br>it's entirely appropriate to claim it as<br>your discipline<br>importantly she addressed the question<br>of what<br>and how her discipline matters in the<br>world and which you currently find<br>ourselves<br>she suggested at one point that the<br>discipline of medieval english<br>literature might once have been<br>understood as advisable to learn in<br>order for one to be a good citizen of<br>the empire<br>i think professor marshall has<br>established herself as a scholar who<br>questions that once accepted truth<br>she has brought forth the voice of woman<br>and of the anon<br>and in some ways just as her calligraphy<br>lesson<br>that she gave at the beginning showed us<br>the errors and disparities in a poor<br>example of script so i think her<br>research is also doing this as is the<br>research of others that she is<br>championing<br>she's also convinced of the necessity<br>that our research must engage with our<br>wider community<br>and that we must take our research into<br>the public domain<br>and i think this is what humanities<br>scholars must keep doing<br>and i'm very proud and as i know simon<br>is that we're members of tekita adenoid<br>humanities where this is exactly what we<br>try to do every day in our work<br>so thank you thank you simone for your<br>research thank you for your detective<br>work thank you for your creativity and<br>thank you for the wonderful way in which<br>you communicate your research and we've<br>been lucky to see um the oratory version<br>of it but she's also an excellent<br>teacher of written communication as well<br>and i have the pleasure of<br>giving you a wee<br>symbol of our appreciation a gift from<br>us<br>to mark this evening and to thank you<br>uh and now to our audience those who are<br>here with us in person and those online<br>thank you so much for joining us i know<br>that um simone really appreciates that<br>as do those of us here in the front row<br>as university leaders we really<br>appreciate your support of the work that<br>we do here as scholars so thank you for<br>please come with us over to the staff<br>club it's a wee walk out in the cold i<br>hope it's not raining but it's well<br>worth it because there is food and drink<br>and a lovely warm room and we get to<br>share that food with simon to<br>congratulate her and to be with her<br>family so thank you all for coming and<br>we'll see you over there shortly</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
