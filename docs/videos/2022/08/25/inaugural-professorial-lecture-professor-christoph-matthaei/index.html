celebration of<br>kristoff's promotion to professor and<br>for those who don't know me<br>my name is david murdock i'm the vice<br>chancellor of the university and and my<br>main role here is to welcome you all and<br>it's wonderful to see so many people on<br>such a cold evening and i know there are<br>a lot more uh joining us online either<br>live stream or we'll be watching it<br>later so welcome<br>to you all welcome to the wider<br>university community uh welcome to uh<br>those from the dunedin white dunedin<br>community who are watching<br>who have come here and are watching<br>online and a particular welcome to<br>christoph's whanau and friends<br>who are both here today and<br>joining online and i do believe we have<br>some special guests today i'm<br>christoph's wife caroline<br>nice to meet you welcome along and some<br>friends<br>and i also understand that christoph<br>your your brother stefan and his<br>daughter tula are uh<br>hopefully joining us live stream while<br>hiking in the french alps so i'm really<br>hoping that's working out that would be<br>wonderful and also<br>a welcome to um<br>christoph's um mother paula but i think<br>she's probably more likely not to be<br>watching live stream but maybe later on<br>but uh welcome and i know there'll be<br>lots of other people who have<br>friends supported kristoff through his<br>career who will either be here and i<br>haven't mentioned specifically we'll be<br>joining a big welcome to to everybody<br>um<br>it's kind of a tradition in the<br>introduction to these<br>lectures to highlight the significance<br>of a promotion to professor at the<br>university of otago it is a high bar i<br>mean we expect<br>we have quite a rigorous process we<br>expect<br>our staff to<br>show sustained outstanding performance<br>in teaching research and service<br>and<br>more than that we also for this<br>promotion expect leadership<br>evidence of leadership and usually in<br>more than one area so it is a high bar<br>and i know many of<br>us are referees for overseas<br>universities and certainly my<br>experiences there there has been<br>no university more rigorous than the<br>university of otago its promotion so it<br>is a really<br>it is a major achievement and a big big<br>congratulations to to christoph for<br>achieving it<br>um<br>as you may be aware<br>um these are these are a traditional<br>event uh the inaugural professor<br>lectures to celebrate promotion to<br>professor but as you may be aware we're<br>having a big backlog at the moment<br>because of uh covet a big delay so in<br>fact kristoff was promoted to professor<br>in february last year<br>so it's been and i gather it's been this<br>is third or fourth time maybe um so we<br>finally made it which is wonderful and<br>uh it's great to be here<br>now i'm going to um<br>pass on uh<br>to<br>professor richard barker who's the pro<br>vice chancellor of science to give a<br>more detailed introduction of kristoff<br>but i do want to just before i do that<br>just make a give a personal test<br>testimonial<br>my daughter hannah is a graduate of the<br>ecology program<br>so i decided to phone her the other<br>night and say do you have any stories<br>about kristoff<br>um i was most disappointed because she<br>said no i actually couldn't think of any<br>but she gave a<br>immediate indication of how fond she was<br>of christopher's as a as a lecturer and<br>a mentor and<br>record a field trip taken together so<br>there's a<br>you know you may not remember hannah but<br>she's very discerning so that is quite a<br>compliment so it was wonderful to have<br>that connection<br>uh christoph congratulations<br>um<br>and i'm really really looking forward to<br>the lecture and i'll pass on to<br>richardson<br>tena koto tena koto tena koto katoa<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight professor christoph<br>mathai<br>to give his inaugural professorial<br>lecture at the university of otago<br>as you've just heard from our vice<br>chancellor christoph is one of our newer<br>professors at the university of otago<br>having<br>received this well-deserved promotion to<br>the position in february of last year<br>and judith however this auspicious event<br>indeed has been a long time coming<br>christoph was born in the town of<br>morsbach near heidelberg in germany and<br>then attended queenstart gymnasium in<br>mersengen near chubingan<br>you may be aware that he's interested in<br>animals<br>he recalls an early interest in the<br>malaska when aged about five he brought<br>home a bucket of snails to his horrified<br>mother<br>as his taxonomic interest broadened this<br>extended to keeping or collecting<br>tadpoles lizards and butterflies<br>budgies canaries guinea pigs and even<br>tame jackdaw i wonder what he has at<br>home now carolyn<br>and i guess it was the tadpoles that<br>made the lasting influence<br>his interest in animals and the natural<br>environment led to a german diploma in<br>biology at the university of freiburg<br>and then a phd in environmental sciences<br>in 1996 at the swiss federal institute<br>for environmental science and technology<br>in dubendorf and the swiss federal<br>institute of technology in zurich<br>the subject was disturbance and<br>invertebrate patch dynamics in a<br>pre-alpine river topic so i'm sure we're<br>going to hear more about tonight<br>to round out his preparation for an<br>academic career kristoff completed his<br>habilitacion at the university of munich<br>in aquatic ecology in 2002<br>his working life began as a<br>self-employed biologist that's a hard<br>road to<br>contracted<br>by the bavarian water management<br>authority and he wisely decided he would<br>set his sights on joining academia<br>and he did this through a succession of<br>tutor positions and post-doctoral<br>appointments which included a postdoc<br>here at otago<br>before moving on to his first academic<br>appointment as an assistant professor in<br>the department of zoology at the<br>university of munich where he prepared<br>for his habilitation<br>returning to otago and another<br>postdoctoral fellowship position<br>kristoff then moved into a senior<br>research fellow role in the department<br>of zoology in 2011<br>and then<br>a senior lecturer on what we call<br>confirmation path in 2013 and he has<br>indeed rapidly progressed through those<br>ranks culminating in tonight's<br>celebration<br>the reason for this spectacular<br>progression is of course his high level<br>of performance across all three academic<br>domains of research teaching and service<br>in research he is a pbrfa he has an h<br>index of 44 for those who know what<br>these things mean that's impressive<br>and his work comprises 108 journal<br>articles and four book chapters that's<br>been cited close to seven thousand times<br>this research of course is focused on<br>the ecology of running waters the<br>effects of natural disturbances and<br>human induced multiple stresses on<br>stream communities and ecosystems and<br>how to go about restoring these<br>environments<br>he has been highly successful in<br>attracting research funding with more<br>than three and a half million dollars in<br>research grants since 1996 both here in<br>new zealand<br>and uh while overseas and he was just<br>recently named as a collaborator on a 10<br>million euro multiple stressor project<br>led by german researchers<br>his research is both recognised and<br>appreciated for its excellence and in<br>2017 his team received the new zealand<br>river story award for research aimed at<br>improving the health of our rivers<br>his postgraduate teaching has also been<br>award winning he was the otago<br>university students association<br>supervisor of the year in 2011 and was<br>again nominated for this distinction in<br>2018<br>and this followed early recognition that<br>he received to his teaching at the<br>university of munich<br>he has supervised some 25 phd students<br>17 who have completed so there's a bunch<br>out there have got some work to do<br>get cracking<br>and a further 34<br>msc or diplom students<br>many of these students have also<br>themselves won prizes for their work<br>it's not just postgraduate teaching<br>where professor matai excels<br>one of the best measures that we have is<br>our students own experiences the vice<br>chancellor just to test it very powerful<br>this information and as part of his<br>promotion package we looked at student<br>evaluations of his teaching that<br>extended from 2017 through to 2020<br>and every single one of them placed his<br>teaching in the top two categories<br>for overall effectiveness and this is a<br>rare occurrence amongst our teachers<br>he is not just a great teacher he wants<br>to be a better teacher and to help<br>others achieve the same<br>and he has participated as a<br>co-investigator on quality improvement<br>grants and also grants from our<br>committee for the advancement of<br>learning and teaching at the university<br>all aimed at better understanding and<br>improving teaching practice at the<br>university<br>in service christoph has been director<br>of our magnificent ecology degree<br>program<br>since january 2020 and he was previously<br>deputy director of that program and he<br>was the department statistics<br>coordinator from 2013 2019 an incredibly<br>important position i may say<br>he is active in community outreach and<br>and this includes setting up a project<br>looking at the health of the kaikoura<br>stream which is used by kaikai valley<br>high school students<br>to learn about human impacts on aquatic<br>ecosystems<br>and his professional service also<br>extends to to looking under at and<br>understanding these impacts and this<br>includes providing advice<br>to the environmental protection agency<br>and the office of parliamentary<br>commissioner for the environment as well<br>as the otago regional council and<br>ministry for the environment<br>it's enough from me<br>tonight we are going to hear a lot more<br>about this passion for freshwater<br>ecology and some more detail on covering<br>some of the highlights that i've just<br>skimmed over<br>so please join me in welcoming hear<br>good evening or good afternoon ladies<br>and gentlemen and thank you for the kind<br>introduction both david and richard<br>maybe i don't need to say that much<br>anymore after this<br>so uh starting with sort of a brief<br>overview of my lecture<br>so first i'll say a few words about the<br>early days before university my<br>undergrad studies<br>then i'll talk about<br>research on flood disturbance and river<br>restoration that<br>as i've did between 1990 and 2002<br>and then i'll focus on coming back to<br>otago universities of the works since<br>2002 mostly multiple stresses and<br>extreme research and i'll close with a<br>few<br>briefs of reflections on supervision the<br>ecology program and teaching<br>so<br>this is sort of the place where i grew<br>up in in uh southern germany a small<br>town you can't see it on that map uh in<br>southern germany<br>and this is i started out<br>the only nudity i'm going to show<br>tonight<br>and uh this you could say are my<br>mountains the swabian alps they sort of<br>look a bit like uh mountains we've<br>chopped the tops off but still they go<br>up to like a thousand meters and they're<br>really pretty so especially in spring or<br>in autumn so a nice place to grow up<br>and these are some photos about growing<br>up<br>um<br>the jackdaw was already mentioned he<br>really he lived with us for about 10<br>years or really an important character<br>then there's my grandmother mata there<br>my father gunther my brother stefan my<br>mother paola<br>and there you can also see the budding<br>naturalist with the butterfly net<br>and it's interesting because i always<br>cared about animals and and my brother<br>he loved rocks<br>and my brother then he became a<br>geologist and he's now professor at the<br>university of melbourne so both of us<br>ended up really quite far away from this<br>sleepy town in southern germany<br>before i started university<br>this was the time when in germany it was<br>either it was mandatory either military<br>service or a social service and so i<br>worked with handicapped children for 15<br>months in the kindergarten for<br>handicapped children so they were<br>mentally and and physically handicapped<br>and that was a really important time in<br>my life i really enjoyed it i learned a<br>lot about working with children working<br>with people<br>and also i learned that life can really<br>be quite unfair so this was say yeah it<br>was an important time i even thought<br>about working in this area<br>but i then did go to university to<br>university of freiburg so in the<br>southwestern corner of germany just<br>close to switzer to france<br>freiburg at the time was a fairly<br>conservative fairly hierarchical<br>university i found it a little bit<br>disappointing but what was really good<br>this turned out to be one of only two<br>places<br>in germany where he could major in<br>freshwater ecology<br>and i found the freshwater ecologists<br>they they appealed to me and so that's<br>what i ended up doing<br>and i also<br>i wanted to do my<br>master's thesis on an applied topic and<br>so i ended up<br>still being enrolled in university of<br>freiburg but going for the master thesis<br>to munich to the bavarian water<br>management authority<br>and the topic of my<br>master's thesis was an ecological<br>evaluation of the first stream<br>restoration project in bavaria they just<br>got going with that and i did enjoy that<br>and also as richard had mentioned i was<br>able to work commissioned for that water<br>management authority for a year which<br>was a good job like as a student after<br>my student days i earned good money but<br>i did and i could have done it another<br>year but i did realize that during the<br>idea that i did want to do a phd<br>and so then i started looking around and<br>ended up in zurich so still not all that<br>far from where i grew up and so this is<br>a photo with my father from that time<br>who guinda mate who sadly passed away 10<br>years after completed my phd and you can<br>definitely see where i got my chubby<br>so the topic of my<br>phd was disturbance in invertebrate<br>patch dynamics in the pre-alpine river<br>now the university of zurich eth is<br>actually a top 10 ranked university in<br>the world this was not something i had<br>been aware at the time when i went there<br>what was important for me was it was a<br>funded phd position and then another<br>thing i really enjoyed was that both my<br>supervisors they actually gave me a lot<br>of freedom to design my own phd project<br>and what was interesting i was inspired<br>by this conceptual paper from 1989 the<br>patch dynamic concept of stream<br>community ecology which was written by a<br>scientist called colin townsend who at<br>the time was at the university in the uk<br>but just a few years later this same<br>colin townsend moved to new zealand and<br>became the head of department of the<br>zoology department at otago so you'll<br>learn more hear more about colin later<br>on so he inspired me essentially with uh<br>to do my phd topic<br>so now i'll give you a bit of background<br>about my phd topic so if we consider<br>factors that influence the structure and<br>function of living communities so<br>probably the best known ones are<br>competition and predation and parasitism<br>also plays an important role maybe a bit<br>less studied mutualism that organisms<br>help each other plays an important role<br>too and then there's disturbance<br>so the first four are biological factors<br>disturbance is a bit different so what<br>is disturbance you can define it as any<br>discrete event in time that interrupts<br>an ongoing process or changes a settled<br>state<br>and so typically disturbances displace<br>or kill organisms they influence the<br>availability of space or food or they<br>change the physical environment<br>so on the other hand so disturbances if<br>you get killed or displaced is not so<br>good but on the other hand disturbances<br>open up space and they free up resources<br>that can then be taken over by new<br>individuals so disturbances have both<br>positive consequences and negative<br>consequences so you could argue to some<br>extent all ecosystems need disturbances<br>disturbances do occur pretty much in all<br>ecosystems the only question is how big<br>will they be and how often they will<br>occur<br>and ecologists typically talk about<br>natural disturbances and most often<br>physical disturbances so fire high winds<br>landslides floods<br>occasionally talk about biological<br>disturbances imagine a herd of elephants<br>moving through a savannah can cause a<br>lot of damage<br>and then there's also disturbances<br>caused by humans and i've given two<br>examples but in the last 20 years or so<br>typically when it's about humans then<br>people talk about stresses<br>and disturbances also of the natural<br>disturbances and so i'll talk about<br>stresses in the second half of my<br>lecture<br>so then if we consider which factors<br>influence the structure and function of<br>living communities in running waters<br>then clearly like in in running waters<br>the influence of physical disturbance is<br>particularly strong and it's mainly the<br>bad moving floods droughts matter in<br>some regions of the world too but<br>overall it's mainly the floods<br>and so that's sort of the background so<br>these are for my phd there were five<br>publications from that time and four of<br>them were manipulative field experiments<br>i've always do i love doing manipulative<br>experiments one was a literature review<br>and i'll talk briefly about this one<br>study<br>and so this was work done<br>in the river necker in northern<br>switzerland and this is a river which on<br>average floods once a month so it's<br>frequently disturbed and that's of<br>course really good if you want to do<br>flood research<br>and so at that time<br>there were a lot of<br>experiments where people tried to<br>simulate floods of by doing physical<br>disturbances in in streams<br>and uh but the the crucial point is<br>about whenever you do an experiment you<br>have to ask yourself just how realistic<br>can that be and so<br>for<br>disturbance experiments in streams the<br>crucial point is to which extent can<br>they actually simulate a natural flood<br>and in this study i was actually able to<br>look at that directly so we had up there<br>you can see uh that there or maybe i'll<br>use the mouse here so these were um<br>experimental plots like three by three<br>meter plots that we uh disturbed<br>physically like we had a team of four<br>people kicking and raking disturb them<br>as much as possible and then there were<br>another five plots and they were<br>actually plots that had been disturbed<br>during a natural flood<br>and so this is so if you can see here<br>these are the invertebrates living in<br>the stream bed and so this is the total<br>abundance of those invertebrates and<br>there you can see this was the abundance<br>before that flood came and then it<br>knocked it back by about 90 then there<br>was a lag phase and then the abundances<br>went up again to about 200 000 per<br>square meter and 19 days after the flood<br>we started the experimental disturbance<br>and then you could compare some of the<br>two trajectories and you can see that if<br>there's a lag phase when it comes to<br>total abundance<br>but these are three common uh stream<br>invertebrates like a mayfly larvae a<br>stone fly larvae a water mite and there<br>you can actually see that the recovery<br>trajectories are really quite similar<br>and so so in this study we concluded<br>that our experiment did allow a<br>realistic simulation of several<br>important effects of a large flood uh on<br>the invertebrate community and this<br>large flood it only occurred once every<br>five years on average so it was really<br>fairly large so it was surprising that<br>he could simulate it that well<br>with an experiment and it was only the<br>second time this had been done<br>and you really have to say you needed<br>quite a lot of good luck for that<br>because basically you first needed a big<br>flood and then he needed a nice stable<br>period of about 40 days to also do your<br>experimental disturbance and so this was<br>in 1994 when i got lucky but in 1993<br>that same river flooded 10 times in 12<br>weeks so i tried all the time was<br>completely hopeless so so yeah you have<br>to be lucky when you're doing flood<br>research<br>okay so that was my phd<br>so after that then i did come<br>to otago university for the first time<br>to do a post-doc and i was really<br>excited because i met colin townsend at<br>the conference we got along well and of<br>course every ecologist knows colin<br>townsend because he's written he's one<br>of the three authors of the key textbook<br>in ecology but for me it was really also<br>exciting because he had written this<br>patch dynamics concept which had<br>inspired my phd so it was really cool<br>for me that i could go and do a postdoc<br>with colin and i managed to get funds<br>from the swiss national science<br>foundation<br>to do that and uh so the topic was flood<br>refugee for stream invertebrates and<br>basically it built on my phd it<br>continued on from there<br>and uh so again we got lucky we got lots<br>of floods so there were seven papers<br>from from this postdoc two were actually<br>from the honors thesis of dean olsen who<br>was the first honor student i<br>co-supervised uh in at otago and dane<br>would have been here tonight except that<br>unfortunately his partner got coveted so<br>he has to isolate<br>yeah so i'll talk briefly about two of<br>these studies<br>these were done at the qyburn in central<br>otago so you can look at this river you<br>can see again it's got quite an unstable<br>bed um it's got a high sort of gravel<br>supply from from the steep catchment it<br>is in central otago but because it's in<br>the mountains it does really flood so<br>it's a nice<br>system to do disturbance research and<br>also probably some of you will know just<br>around the corner is dancey's past pub<br>which is a really great great place to<br>stay after a long day of field work<br>so what we did in this<br>these two papers was the first thing we<br>wanted to know if you've got bed<br>movements during floods is it all or<br>nothing or are they patchy and we looked<br>at the surface bed stability and at the<br>time geomorphologists and ecologists<br>thought either the bed moves or it<br>doesn't and we thought maybe it's it's a<br>bit more complicated so we came up with<br>this slightly insane sort of approach of<br>marking hundreds of surface stones that<br>were only like 50 centimeters apart we<br>had also an extra long drill bit<br>were able to mark them in situ in place<br>we didn't have to shift them<br>and then we could relocate we could find<br>them again after four floods and we<br>could see whether they remained stable<br>or whether they moved<br>and so then when we looked at the<br>patterns of stone disturbance it was<br>patchy and that was sort of the first<br>study to show this and there was some<br>variations of a cross we had three<br>different sites with 400 stones each so<br>and three different sites there was some<br>variation across the sites and events<br>but at the same time it was reasonably<br>predictable essentially the bigger a<br>stone was the more likely it was remains<br>to remain stable and also whether it was<br>embedded or whether it was lying loosely<br>on the surface so that sort of made<br>sense and what was exciting for us then<br>we asked the question so how does this<br>patchiness of bed disturbance which<br>people hadn't expected how does it<br>affect the stream organisms and we did a<br>study where we found out that actually<br>stable surface stones can serve as flood<br>refuge for invertebrates so either the<br>invertebrates stay on these stable<br>stones or they even move there and we<br>sort of did some video studies where we<br>sort of confirmed that behavior of the<br>invertebrates and i can actually see<br>chris abba clean the audience over there<br>and he was really played a key role in<br>collecting these samples so great to see<br>you here too<br>okay so after that<br>i then uh went went back to germany and<br>i spent four years at the university of<br>munich<br>working with sebastian diehl sebastian<br>diehl is a freshwater ecologist who<br>mainly works in<br>lakes in standing waters there's a lot<br>of ecological modeling and my role in<br>munich was to build up a running water<br>ecology teaching program and a research<br>group<br>and also as richard had mentioned during<br>that time<br>i completed my habilitation<br>which is the highest possible academic<br>degree in german-speaking countries and<br>what it is is essentially a bigger phd<br>on top of your phd a bunch of<br>publications you have to fit together<br>with a certain topic and it's a funny<br>thing that habilitation because in<br>germany it's a big deal so if you want<br>to become a university academic in<br>germany you need that habilitation even<br>now<br>outside of germany nobody cares<br>and nobody even knows what it is really<br>so yeah so that's the habitation<br>um i'll pick one example from that time<br>and that was a restoration project and<br>that was a restoration project where<br>there was a phd student harad huber and<br>two masters students dominique paulie<br>and claude acosta involved and the<br>question was how does river restoration<br>affect bed morphology geomorphology and<br>the benthic river invertebrates<br>and so this was quite a large<br>restoration project about 60 million new<br>zealand dollars and it's a river that<br>runs right through munich and<br>essentially in this study we used what's<br>called a becky design a before after<br>control impact design where we had one<br>year of before data two years of after<br>data and we had three reaches they were<br>one kilometer long each so one was a<br>channelized reach which remained<br>channelized during the entire time<br>that was our negative control the next<br>one was the restored range the impact<br>reach it remained channelized for the<br>first year and then they went in with<br>heavy machinery and sort of<br>open it up and then there were several<br>floods that did more work so it became<br>quite diverse<br>and then fortunately we also had a<br>natural reach which was about 10<br>kilometers upstream which was quite uh<br>natural and he could sort of compare<br>that as well so we had a negative<br>control in the positive control<br>so when first we looked at the bed<br>movement patterns during floods and<br>again this river floods quite a lot so<br>before the restoration we had six floods<br>so in the natural reach<br>the<br>the bed movement patterns were quite<br>diverse<br>so you've got local scour you've got<br>local uh sedimentary position you've got<br>quite a lot of stable patches as well so<br>a patchy mosaic of bed movement patterns<br>whereas in the channelized rage it was a<br>lot more homogeneous it was mainly<br>either scour or fill<br>and there were hardly any stable patches<br>so quite a different pattern and that<br>was uh the same sort of say this is the<br>resort range before it was<br>restored so that was homogeneous and the<br>channelized reach also had this<br>homogeneous bed movement pattern<br>and then after the restoration and those<br>two years there were 11 floods and so<br>then basically the patterns remained the<br>same for the natural reach they remained<br>diverse and in the channelized reach<br>they remained homogeneous and nicely in<br>the restored range they did go from uh<br>homogeneous to diverse so in fact they<br>became really similar to the bed<br>movement patterns in the natural reach<br>and that was what we had been hoping<br>would happen and then also when we<br>looked at the river invertebrate<br>communities when we looked at their<br>taxon richness or measure of<br>biodiversity at the restored range that<br>increased significantly compared to the<br>two control reaches<br>and also the<br>diversity of ept attacks out there<br>that's the mayflies the stoneflies and<br>the caddisflies and that was<br>a really good thing to happen because<br>those ept insect larvae they're used<br>around the world to determine ecological<br>stream health so if you have more ept<br>organisms in your community it's a<br>healthier stream essentially or<br>healthier river<br>so that means that in terms of the<br>biological effects ecological effects it<br>was a successful restoration and you<br>could say well isn't that what you would<br>expect<br>well perhaps but<br>we have to be aware that literally<br>there's many billions of dollars that<br>have been spent on river restoration<br>since the 1990s mainly in north america<br>a lot of them in europe as well with the<br>water framework directive<br>but if you ask the question how many of<br>them are successful and there's these<br>are review articles so they've reviewed<br>the literature there's six of them<br>and the answer to that question<br>unfortunately is not many<br>and so so what's happening there well<br>uh when you when you look more closely<br>the restoration of the hydromorphology<br>is often successful that so if it does<br>become more diverse so you could say the<br>habitat quality should be improved to<br>aquatic organisms but still<br>when you then look at the river<br>organisms then their responses are often<br>really weak or completely absent<br>so then we can ask why was the river<br>issa restoration successful<br>and these are sort of three of the key<br>criteria that in those reviews have been<br>recommended with restoration project<br>should do<br>so the first question has the natural<br>flow regime been restored well partly at<br>least because the flood disturbance<br>regime is still quite natural i told you<br>there were like 17 floods in those three<br>years so floods are common the bed is<br>unstable it's frequently moved and also<br>the bed load supply from the catchment<br>of river from from the bavarian alps is<br>quite high which it should be in this<br>river<br>and then also have been existing<br>upstream high quality catchments have<br>they been protected yes that is the case<br>and that's a really cool thing if you<br>consider munich a city of 2 million<br>people so they're sizable natural river<br>sections just 10 kilometers upstream<br>and then a third<br>natural ecosystem processes and<br>connectivity have they been<br>re-established in the restored river<br>segments yes that has been the case as<br>well both in the restored sections and<br>then also in those natural river<br>sections upstream so that's probably why<br>this restoration project was an<br>exception to the rule<br>okay so<br>this was my example from from munich<br>so<br>in the normal course of things or my<br>plan had been after i completed the<br>rehabilitation<br>then i would would have applied for<br>associate professorships in germany or<br>switzerland that's the first permanent<br>academic positions that's what you're<br>qualified to do once you've completed<br>the habitation<br>but that's not what happened what<br>happened instead<br>was that i met caroline<br>and so so this was in 2001 i managed to<br>get some funds from the german research<br>foundation so i could come to otago on a<br>six-month research sabbatical and i<br>brought along a phd student and a<br>master's student and i met caroline and<br>after a few months we knew that we<br>wanted to stay together<br>and at that time caroline already had<br>she was a senior lecturer in the human<br>nutrition department otago so she had a<br>permanent position and i didn't so<br>something had to be done<br>and so then up until then i had always<br>done what you typically do in science in<br>academia you move to where the next job<br>is<br>but then i decide i won't do that i want<br>to live with caroline in dunedin and i<br>hope that the job will sort itself out<br>and i have to say that was<br>probably the most important decision in<br>my life and probably the best decision<br>in my life<br>it was also<br>what it meant is that then i returned<br>permanently to new zealand<br>and then it did mean that i was on soft<br>money for more than 10 years until june<br>2013 so project uh based and this in<br>terms of my career this certainly was a<br>risky decision some people would use<br>other words for that<br>and uh i really have to say that in the<br>end i i got lucky and and i i'm still<br>really grateful to the department of<br>zoology<br>that they actually hired me in 2013<br>because it was really that close that it<br>didn't hire me so<br>the people who thought it was extremely<br>risky they did have a point<br>and i certainly wouldn't recommend it if<br>you want to have a straight academic<br>career<br>but anyway it turned out well for me<br>in this context i really also have to<br>say i really have to thank colin<br>townsend<br>and colin thompson not only he gave me a<br>job in 2002 so i could come back and<br>live with caroline but also really he<br>has been the most important scientific<br>mentor in my academic career<br>and we wrote more than 40 papers<br>together so certainly learned a lot<br>about academic writing scientific<br>writing from collin we also<br>co-supervised quite a few phd students<br>mentored two post-docs together<br>and he certainly made me a lot more an<br>open-minded and more successful<br>collaborator when i started out i was a<br>bit narrow-minded a bit arrogant<br>you can be when you're young and you<br>think you know what you're doing so that<br>colin really really gave me really good<br>advice in that regard<br>and then also later on<br>this was important too that he gave me<br>the freedom and the independence to make<br>my own mark and then it has to be said<br>his decision to go and face retirement<br>in 2012 was really timely for me<br>because a few years later it probably<br>would have been too late for me because<br>i was getting too old<br>so<br>coming back to dunedin<br>i worked on multiple stresses and so now<br>a bit of background about the multiple<br>stresses research so we'll start out<br>with this what is a stressor<br>so a stressor can be defined as a<br>variable that as a result of human<br>activity and that's really important<br>exceeds its range of normal variation<br>and then affects animal and plant<br>communities and often it affects them in<br>negative ways but really important as a<br>result of human activity so stressors<br>usually there are stressors there are<br>several stresses acting and they can<br>interact as well and how do they<br>interact well there's of basically two<br>fundamental options there can either be<br>a simple multiple stressor effect where<br>the effects of all stresses combined<br>are equal to typically the sum of the<br>individual effects and you've got an<br>additive multiple stressor effect<br>or it could be a complex interaction<br>where the combined effect is either<br>smaller or larger than one would predict<br>based on the single stressor effects<br>involved and if the combined effect is<br>smaller you call it an antagonistic<br>interaction and if it's larger you call<br>it a synergistic interaction<br>multiple stresses<br>are also really important for resource<br>managers because resource managers they<br>need to know not just that an ecosystem<br>has been affected but also they need to<br>know the causes of this harm and<br>typically they want to define thresholds<br>of harm beyond which an ecosystem<br>shouldn't be allowed to move<br>and because there's in present-day<br>ecosystems there's always<br>almost always multiple stresses at work<br>managers may get it wrong if these<br>stresses interact in unexpected ways<br>multiple stressors is a rapidly growing<br>research area so you can sort of see in<br>the 1990s no one worked on multiple<br>stresses but now as events from about<br>2010 it really took off so this is<br>publications citations per year in these<br>two fields and you can see now we're up<br>to like 30 000 citations a year and more<br>than 700 publications and that arrow we<br>started doing our multiple stresses<br>research in 2003 so we started fairly<br>early in that development<br>probably one of the reasons why there's<br>so much more multiple stresses research<br>now is because they're relevant for<br>global problems and so i've just picked<br>a few examples so they are believed to<br>drive the global declines of honeybees<br>so pesticides varroa mites possibly<br>diesel fumes are stresses<br>also amphibians not a happy frog that<br>one pesticides kitrid fungus climate<br>change are stresses<br>and then also a classic one is<br>freshwater biodiversity and so<br>freshwater biodiversity globally is<br>declining faster than terrestrial<br>biodiversity or marine biodiversity or<br>so closer to home<br>the multiple stresses research that<br>is a lot of it is<br>linked to land use changes in southern<br>new zealand so where sort of in at least<br>in<br>european times you often start out with<br>either say an ungraced tussock stream<br>or some kind of<br>pasture um and and often of a lower<br>intensity pasture like sheep or sheep<br>and beef grazing where you've got some<br>tussock margin strips but then there's<br>also the more intensive dairy and deer<br>farming and certainly<br>in the last two decades that has been<br>sort of the big change of going going<br>from some<br>tussock or sheep or sheep and beef<br>pasture to dairy farming and so when<br>that happens<br>what's happening uh in streams and so<br>we'll look at that sort of in in two<br>steps<br>so if catchment land use changes say<br>from sheep and beef pasture to dairy<br>farming then often the physical<br>chemistry of the stream changes so that<br>shade may change if repair and<br>vegetation is removed<br>nutrient concentrations often increase<br>pollutants like pesticides often<br>increase the fine sediment budget often<br>increases and the flow regime can change<br>if there's water abstraction for<br>irrigation so all of these can change<br>and then you have the sort of a<br>simplified stream food web where you've<br>got the primer to produces the algae<br>invertebrate consumers and then you've<br>got bakir and fungi contributing and the<br>fish as top predators so essentially<br>what happens is that catchment land use<br>changes physical chemistry changes and<br>that in turn influences the ecology but<br>how it influenced the ecology and how<br>those different stresses interact that's<br>where it gets complicated and that's<br>where the research comes in<br>there's different approaches<br>to understanding multiple stresses<br>so multiple stressor theory hasn't been<br>around for all that long so<br>to advance that is still important it's<br>happening quite a bit<br>you can do field surveys which are the<br>most realistic thing to do you go out in<br>the field and measure things but of<br>course they lack control because you're<br>just measuring there's a lot of<br>confounding variation<br>on the other end of the scale you can do<br>lab experiments which are highly<br>controlled but often it has to be said<br>their realism is in question because<br>they're so simplified<br>and then somewhere in the middle our<br>field experiments which when done well<br>hopefully will be reasonably controlled<br>and reasonably realistic and then<br>finally if you've done quite a lot of<br>the earlier research then you can also<br>do ecological modeling which allows<br>scaling up in space or time<br>and we've used in our research we've<br>used all five approaches<br>more than 60 publications so far and<br>today i'll talk mainly about some<br>so<br>we've done more than 16 stream surveys<br>they're really good starting points so<br>to get an idea what's going on the<br>stream survey is a logical thing to do<br>and then we've done these experiments at<br>different spatial scales so we've done<br>several in 50 meter reaches where we had<br>up to 12 streams<br>then we went to two and a half meter<br>channels<br>we had 18 of these channels and then we<br>went to these smaller circular channels<br>where we had 128 channels this is the<br>extreme system you're going to hear<br>quite a bit more about that and then<br>also lab experiments in these small<br>containers in the lab where we had sort<br>of 40 to 50 of these<br>and you have to be sort of aware that if<br>you look at think about scale and<br>realism that these are the most<br>realistic experiments in terms of the<br>scale but they have the least control<br>and here you sort of increase the<br>replication and the experimental control<br>so it's a trade-off between those two<br>and we are the only research group in<br>the world that has run experiments<br>across all these different scales and<br>approaches<br>creatures were studying quite a lot of<br>different ones so not just stream<br>invertebrates but also algae and<br>bacteria<br>then<br>studying fish as well and things like<br>ecosystem processes like leaf<br>decomposition where aquatic fungi come<br>in and we've also used genetic or<br>genomic methods mainly on invertebrates<br>and bacteria<br>and so now what's the extreme system so<br>it is an experimental stream channel set<br>up that we built at the cowell river in<br>north otago and in this context i really<br>have to acknowledge the role of jay<br>pigott<br>so jay pickett<br>we've got a long association so he did a<br>summer bursary uh with us in 2004<br>then he worked as a research assistant<br>in the stream team then he did his<br>masters there which was upgraded to a<br>phd and then later on he did his postdoc<br>or postdoc with with us as well and<br>since 2017<br>he's an academic at trinity college<br>dublin where he's in ireland where he's<br>a senior lecturer now and the thing is<br>that i got the idea for this system at a<br>conference i think in about 2004 and<br>then i got together with jay and we<br>talked about whether we might be able to<br>build something like that but actually<br>jay did most of the engineering of this<br>and he was only like 23 at the time it<br>was really impressive so without jay<br>this thing would not exist we even have<br>an extreme systems limited accompany a<br>limited company since 2013.<br>so to give you one example of<br>an extreme experiment how it works this<br>was from sam mccauley's phd a study we<br>published in global change biology<br>because it had a climate change angle<br>so where we investigated the individual<br>and combined effects of pesticide pulses<br>imidacloprid is the most commonly used<br>insecticide in the world and raised<br>water temperature<br>climate change angle and then we did<br>this on stream invertebrates in fast and<br>slow flowing micro habitats because<br>often in fast flowing micro habitats you<br>have more of these pollution sensitive<br>organisms and so we wanted to see<br>whether there was a difference<br>and so the system<br>is like this so you've got the river<br>behind and you've got these 12 header<br>tanks<br>eight header tanks the water gets pumped<br>in from the river brings organisms with<br>it uh from the river and then it's<br>gravity fed in these channels so you've<br>got 128 of these circular stream<br>channels stream mesocosms<br>in sam's experiment we also had gas flow<br>through gas water heaters because we<br>heated half the channels<br>and then this is looking at one channel<br>so the water comes in<br>at these inflow jets and then it sort of<br>goes around in circles but it also flows<br>out in the middle and importantly it<br>brings in these organisms like the<br>invertebrates<br>bacteria algae and then the<br>invertebrates they can decide whether<br>they want to stay or whether i want to<br>leave the channels again so it's a<br>dynamic<br>system it's an open flow dynamic system<br>and in sam's experiment we have first<br>had three weeks where we manipulate the<br>flow velocity<br>basically to create those different<br>communities and then we had 24 days<br>where we still manipulate flow velocity<br>but then we also did the heating and we<br>added the pesticide in three different<br>pulses and the water temperature was<br>raised by three degrees to simulates of<br>a high emission scenario for new zealand<br>and then we had four environmentally<br>realistic concentrations of that<br>pesticide<br>and response variables basically we're<br>looking at invertebrate community<br>dynamics so first we're looking at the<br>drift so you've got drift nets that you<br>put on and you can sort of measure how<br>many of the organisms leave the channels<br>because they don't like the conditions<br>you do that so over uh 48 hours maybe<br>you get some like 100 organisms in that<br>in 48 hours<br>at the end of the experiment you collect<br>the whole channel bit there you get<br>maybe a thousand to three thousand<br>organisms and then also we can study the<br>emerged adult insects these are hair<br>nets so you capture the<br>emerged adult insects<br>we do have to ask this question how<br>realistic can these little cake tins be<br>because that's what they are they're<br>microwave cake tins<br>and the answer to that question is<br>surprisingly realistic and the key<br>features are that they allow the natural<br>immigration and immigration of stream<br>organisms that's really the key features<br>because a stream is an open it's the<br>ultimate open system and then also<br>remember that we did these larger scale<br>studies so we can also<br>compare our findings across the<br>different approaches and often the<br>patterns are really surprisingly<br>consistent which is reassuring and so<br>this is<br>what one of the referees of one of our<br>papers concluded this system is a rare<br>combination of strict control excellent<br>statistical power and a high degree of<br>realism<br>so these are the extreme experiments<br>that we've done in new zealand since<br>2007. you can see we've gone a bit wild<br>there so 13.<br>a lot of different stresses a lot of<br>them involved fine sediment then also<br>nutrient enrichment was common then we<br>had also several were linked to climate<br>change so we had temperature in three<br>where we increased temperature one we<br>even increased co2 that was a recent one<br>that has never been done before<br>and then there were two where we had<br>pesticides uh and also we had an<br>antibiotic and we had an uh<br>nitrification inhibitor so really quite<br>a wide range of<br>experiments and in fact the stress is<br>manipulated and you can also see a lot<br>of<br>postgrad students and also several<br>postdocs so a lot of work<br>in in this<br>research<br>so now if i combine<br>some of our<br>key findings from 12 years of multiple<br>stressors research in a single slide so<br>this is not just the extreme experiments<br>but everything<br>then we can say<br>first land use effects on streams<br>there's almost always multiple stresses<br>at work and we have found that by<br>combining surveys and experiments it<br>helps us understand multiple stresses<br>and then nutrient enrichment actually a<br>bit surprisingly often at least in new<br>zealand it has positive effects at lower<br>levels but then it can become harmful at<br>higher levels and also when it's<br>combined with other stresses but it's<br>not so bad on its own and that was<br>something like 15 years ago that's all<br>that people cared about<br>eutrophication nutrient enrichment not<br>that bad really if it's just nutrients<br>but<br>fine sediment by contrast is a different<br>story so fine sediment has mainly<br>negative effects even on its own it's<br>got more pervasive effects than<br>nutrients and we've learned over the<br>years that fine sediment is really like<br>a master stressor in running waters<br>unfortunately we talked a lot to policy<br>makers and resource managers and they<br>realized that now so now<br>say that mfe knows that fine sediment is<br>a master stressor in running waters<br>water abstraction we found also that it<br>has mainly negative effects on its own<br>but then it also made effects of the<br>elevated fine sediment worse because you<br>had synergistic interactions with the<br>fine sediment and so along similar lines<br>if you have streams that are already<br>subjected to one or more stresses<br>they're likely to be affected more<br>severely by global warming because again<br>due to stressor interactions and then<br>finally we did some work on pesticides<br>mainly glyphosate and we found that that<br>could have negative effects as well i<br>will come back to pesticides a bit later<br>because there's more to that story<br>so<br>i did already say<br>that fortunately our research did<br>contribute to policy changes when it<br>came to uh sediment effects on streams<br>and so i've spent a lot of time over the<br>last 10 15 years talking to people from<br>mlv<br>regional councils policy makers and this<br>basically was because all this<br>complicated stuff you have to boil it<br>down to a clear message<br>and that was the message keep the fine<br>settlement out of streams it's bad<br>enough on its own and then there are<br>several other stresses that make its<br>richard already mentioned it in 2017 we<br>were fortunate enough to receive the new<br>zealand river story award for our<br>contributions to improving the<br>ecological health of new zealand's<br>rivers and streams<br>and this photo shows me<br>well i had to give an oscar-style<br>acceptance speech in a room<br>full of important people politicians and<br>so on you can see i was a bit concerned<br>our extreme research so it has happened<br>a lot in new zealand but also actually a<br>lot has happened overseas and this is<br>something where jay piguet is really a<br>key driver<br>and so jay has got this vision that he<br>wants to create a global collaborative<br>network of extreme systems so let's see<br>how he's doing so we started in in 2007<br>then in 2013 we had a second system in<br>in germany 2021 they got a third that's<br>where that big grant they got the big<br>grant<br>in 2016 a third system in ireland<br>2018 and 19 a system in china and the<br>system in japan<br>and 2022 in brazil there were some covet<br>delays but now we've got one in brazil<br>and then also this year another new<br>system will be built in the uk at oxford<br>university and interestingly there's two<br>postdocs involved one is james orr who's<br>one of jay's phd students or former phd<br>students and one is sam mccauley who did<br>this phd with me and jay was a<br>co-supervisor<br>and then also in 2022 we've got this new<br>project where we want to perform ultra<br>deep metagenomic analyses on microbial<br>communities in at least four of these<br>extreme systems of around the world i<br>don't even know what that is but my my<br>collaborators in germany do<br>and so yeah so that's you could sort of<br>say that jay's vision is starting to<br>become reality and so far 22 experiments<br>and more than 30 publications and those<br>numbers are rising every year<br>okay<br>so with that i'll return briefly to the<br>pesticides and this is of a bit of a<br>grim story so this was a high pr profile<br>article that was in science in 2013 and<br>uh with data from<br>the united nations and this is basically<br>the pesticide use on hectares of<br>cropland<br>and if you look so that we've got four<br>uses categories and there's new zealand<br>unfortunately it's in the highest<br>category it's pretty close to the usage<br>of china<br>and it's way higher than the uk<br>uh or france or canada or the us<br>so it's not looking good and when you<br>look at the 2020 data the latest data<br>it's not looking much better<br>so<br>if you put that together<br>the reality in 2022 really quite<br>disturbing fun pun intended<br>new zealand impul imports a lot of tons<br>of pesticides each year so the neonic<br>insecticides they're quite controversial<br>overseas we still use them those alone<br>we import more than 50 tonnes in 2019.<br>that's a lot and as i said our annual<br>pesticide use on croplands is much<br>higher than in many other countries<br>but unfortunately we don't have any<br>monitoring of concentrations or<br>frequency of occurrence of pesticides in<br>new zealand surface fresh waters there's<br>hardly any data available we did the<br>first stream survey of pesticides in new<br>zealand we sort of was like a shot in<br>the dark 36 agricultural streams we<br>looked for seven pesticides and we found<br>all seven pesticides and we found them<br>even at a single site or seven so<br>they're definitely there but the big big<br>question is in how high are the<br>concentrations and that's just where we<br>need monitoring we really know hardly<br>anything<br>so then we've published seven papers<br>about this in the last three years and<br>they were based on<br>five lab experiments and one extreme<br>experiment and in those we found strong<br>negative effects of emitter chloride<br>that most commonly used insecticide in<br>the world<br>on the pollution sensitive mayfly larvae<br>delitidium in the lab experiments and<br>then also on the latidium and other ept<br>insect larvae in the stream communities<br>in sam mccauley's extreme experiment<br>and importantly those negative effects<br>occurred at field realistic pesticide<br>concentrations based on overseas data<br>but the concentrations in new zealand<br>streams are actually likely to be higher<br>because our pesticide usage is higher so<br>overall<br>israeli there is an urgent need for<br>nationwide pesticide monitoring and more<br>research and i'm hoping that in my<br>remaining time at otago that i<br>contribute<br>to making some things happen there but i<br>know four fine said i mean it took me 10<br>years<br>so it's not going to happen overnight<br>but that's what i'm hoping to make<br>happen<br>okay and finally why should we care<br>about this ept insect larvae just<br>remembering they are key indicators of<br>stream health used around the world and<br>losing them would equal poor ecological<br>health of new zealand streams in the eye<br>of the world if you think about our<br>clean green image wouldn't be good<br>but then also they are a preferred food<br>both for native fish and for brown trout<br>and so that means they're important for<br>sustaining both the native fish<br>biodiversity but then also healthy trout<br>populations for recreational and guided<br>fishing<br>and then finally those emerged adult<br>insects if you think about a mayfly<br>hatch they're actually really important<br>food for things like repairing spiders<br>birds and other animals so it's it's<br>also important for the terrestrial food<br>web it's not just what's happening in<br>the streams it basically affects the<br>terrestrial food web as well so really<br>we should care about these mayflies<br>and stoneflies and caddisflies<br>now i've got four minutes what's left<br>about<br>other things and this one here<br>this one took me a while to put together<br>you could say it was a labor of love<br>so uh that's<br>not quite all of my postgrad students<br>i've supervised at otago like 55 3 i<br>couldn't show and then there's 21<br>overseas so 76 in total i never added up<br>it's 41 female 35 males so it's a nice<br>mix i never added it up before<br>and i have to say that uh what's always<br>fascinated me about supervision is that<br>well there are sort of some tried and<br>proven supervision tools but at the end<br>of the day to some extent each student<br>is unique<br>so with each new grad student you learn<br>something new and it does keep you on<br>your toes but it also makes it really<br>really rewarding and what's also great<br>to see like there's quite a few say if<br>we look uh there's omar lasales julia<br>hun who came first and did an honours<br>degree with me and then they came back<br>into the phd so there's quite a few of<br>those several uh masters upgrades a lot<br>of those students went and got really<br>good jobs afterwards which is great<br>because in germany as ecologists it's<br>not that easy also mostly in new zealand<br>but also overseas three university<br>academics there's probably several more<br>to come so really really rewarding and<br>to the the postgrad students who are<br>there today i'd really like to say to<br>all of you well thanks for choosing me<br>it's been really really good fun it's a<br>so and then also a few words about the<br>ecology degree program<br>so as richard said like i've taught into<br>the program since 2013<br>when deputy director for five years now<br>a director for two and a half years and<br>again it's a great this is the core<br>teaching team it's a great really great<br>team but it's not just the core teaching<br>team it's also the academic staff<br>members from five different departments<br>we've got many guest lecturers we've got<br>a great admin team so it's just a really<br>great bunch of people to work with we<br>had quite a lot of growth in the last<br>five years which so brought some<br>challenges as well but mostly good fun<br>and i really have to say this is the<br>kind of ecology program i would have<br>loved to have<br>as an undergrad student at freiburg<br>university which was a bit dry and<br>boring but there was nothing like that<br>there<br>and then my teaching at otago these are<br>the nine courses i have taught in<br>and i've<br>really really enjoyed teaching in all of<br>them i've just of highlighted two one is<br>i do like stats and experimental design<br>and and it's not the easiest thing<br>teaching stats and design to ecologists<br>and zoologists but when it does work<br>and i've coordinated that course now<br>coming up for 10 years then it does<br>really<br>it's it's a it's a really good feeling<br>too and and so you always tried to tweak<br>it and make it make it even even better<br>and then there's the other course is the<br>tropical field ecology and uh and this<br>was i was really fortunate that was run<br>three times i was fortunate enough i<br>could go along twice<br>and i was able to work with the amazing<br>phil bishop and um<br>yeah so this is sort of a classic photo<br>so this is where we're in a peat swamp<br>and uh and i think it was phil's aim on<br>that day it was a tropical downpour to<br>get the entire group as wet and as muddy<br>as possible because we were up to our<br>knees in this peat swamp and we were<br>looking for<br>pitcher plants and there might be some<br>bats in there and actually we found some<br>bats in the pitcher plants but the thing<br>is look at phil he loved every second of<br>it and he can look at me and you can see<br>that i'm a bit more ambivalent about<br>this experience and i'm even wearing a<br>wimpy umbrella<br>yeah phil we still miss you a hell of a<br>lot<br>okay and so that's it so this is the<br>thank you slide where i probably have<br>forgotten quite a lot of people i would<br>like to thank my family friends overseas<br>and<br>new zealand and australia my friends<br>overseas also thank you for forgiving me<br>for deserting them moving to the other<br>side of the world<br>and my family then the aquatic ecology<br>departments outside of otago where i've<br>worked before coming to otago there's<br>already department in the ecology<br>program at otago it's really been great<br>working with you it's a biology<br>department it's a really collegial<br>department it's an excellent place to<br>work i'm really happy to be working<br>there and as i said i'm still grateful<br>that you did hire me<br>and then all my postgrad students<br>collaborators undergrad students i've<br>taught the land owners for access to the<br>study sites and finally<br>a huge thank you to you caroline i i<br>can't thank you enough for all the<br>support and the love you've given me the<br>last 20 years and it's been really an<br>amazing time<br>so thank you<br>and with that<br>i'll stop<br>i will say<br>i will comment on christoph's<br>ipl shortly we've heard about stresses<br>and stresses come in all forms shapes<br>and sizes and amongst those are stresses<br>associated with singing in public<br>and this is the opportunity for those<br>who are happy to<br>to exercise their vocal cords to please<br>come and join in for our waiata<br>i also know that it is<br>probably not commonplace to<br>um applaud after the waiata<br>um but i would like to ask you to give<br>these people a thumbs up after the<br>waiata so we can get them to do this<br>so<br>my<br>oh<br>oh<br>hey<br>foreign to you all um it's wonderful to<br>see you here um a special greeting of<br>course to<br>um to christoph and his family whether<br>that's<br>here or through live stream<br>it's really wonderful that you can all<br>attend to this wonderful event<br>also welcome to um<br>colleagues staff<br>students from the department i'm great<br>that you could be here great that you<br>could sing just a wonderful voices it's<br>just fantastic<br>um and of course welcome to all guests<br>i'm mark lockman the head of department<br>in zoology<br>and i'm i'm proud<br>and it's a real privilege to say a few<br>words about kristoff's presentation<br>and<br>some of what i'll present<br>will be<br>i guess resounding what professor<br>richard barker has already mentioned<br>um christoph came to zoology in 2022 at<br>2002<br>and once tenured in 2013 he made a<br>really meteoritic<br>meteoric ascent to full professor<br>which only took him eight years<br>now that progression from senior<br>lecturer to full professor is reflected<br>in a high international standing in the<br>field of<br>river health and stresses in freshwater<br>river systems<br>indeed christoph has a long list of<br>global collaborators and we've seen that<br>it's it's absolutely remarkable<br>i think<br>um and that long list of<br>collaborators is matched by i think an<br>equally impressive list of funding<br>agents not just in new zealand but<br>literally from a good number of<br>countries um all across the word world<br>chris if you gave a wonderful outline of<br>stream health and disturbances<br>as an animal physiologist i comment the<br>word stress from a slightly different<br>angle but<br>we both see it in the same way it is a<br>disturbance<br>and often that disturbance can be<br>unsettling at best<br>um<br>inevitably all that work that you've<br>done is reflected indeed in this age<br>index that professor barker has<br>commented on an eight index of 44 for<br>those of you who don't know what that<br>means believe me that's an impressive<br>achievement<br>as a department<br>i think we are benefiting tremendously<br>from the contributions that you made and<br>the reputation that you have brought and<br>built up i mean i think um as a<br>department we we benefit from that so<br>reputation is not confined to<br>christoph's research<br>again there have been comments made<br>around teaching<br>of course he is the director of the<br>ecology program<br>and<br>that program is managed really<br>effectively and in the last few years<br>what we've seen is an increase in head<br>count to well over 400 in the last few<br>years and these are undergraduate<br>accounts only so on top of that we have<br>our research students<br>so thank you for managing that<br>and for your contributions and<br>christoph is a wonderful educator again<br>i'm<br>i actually haven't seen the slides<br>beforehand but but it is actually<br>evident in everything he does<br>um the dedication to teaching and the<br>dedication commitment to his students is<br>consistent<br>that's reflected in the ousa awards<br>but also<br>in the awards that at least 20 of his<br>students have managed to accrue over the<br>years so<br>these are awards at university level or<br>awards that come with conference<br>presentations and what have you um<br>really very impressive<br>christoph's interest in river health<br>extend to a general appreciation of the<br>outdoors um he's a keen tramper and<br>mountaineer<br>and has explored and climbed widely<br>around<br>mount cook<br>fieldland and mount aspiring national<br>parks<br>he's also done a lot of running and i've<br>benefited from that personally i'm a i'm<br>a keen runner<br>not relevant to you but<br>knowing that i could talk to christopher<br>about running and get some tips around a<br>so-called run walk method and i'm sure<br>he'll be happy to talk to tell you all<br>about this um<br>has been really valuable for me who's<br>i would like to leave you with a<br>whakatauki that seems relevant to your<br>work<br>if the water is healthy the land will be<br>nourished<br>if the land will be nourished the people<br>kira kristoff for your wonderful correl<br>once again it's a real pride to stand<br>here and<br>thank you so much for everything that<br>you've done for the department of<br>zoology<br>i'd like to present this on behalf of<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
