From low resolution pixel-based sprites to cutting-edge real-time 3D graphics, the medium of video games has become much more than pure recreation and its influence can be found in a variety of industries. This lecture will broadly talk about where video games have come from, what they have become, and where they could be going.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts

in the new game design program<br>so i'm here to talk to you a little bit<br>about games<br>uh where to start with games well in the<br>last 20 years video games have gone from<br>sort of an enthusiast hobby<br>into a billion dollar industry that has<br>surpassed even the film industry most<br>recently<br>but where to start with what is<br>admittedly a bit of a broad field i<br>thought we'd do a bit of a history<br>lecture so<br>if we scale way back to the early 60s we<br>have the first video game which was<br>called space war<br>made in mit with a computer probably the<br>size of my office from there<br>we headed into the early rounds of<br>arcades and atari hit strong with pong<br>after pong you have a million pong<br>clones<br>the original arcade machine doesn't look<br>anything like we've probably known today<br>it looked like something out of a space<br>odyssey<br>now at this time the technology isn't<br>quite there to bring that gaming<br>experience into the home so games are<br>relegated mostly to the arcades and then<br>from there<br>we gradually start to build as<br>technology improves and we start getting<br>more game experience so for those of you<br>familiar with pong it's nothing very<br>special by today's standards however<br>from there we start to head into things<br>when namco come on to the scene with<br>things like pac-man mrs pac-man and<br>eventually nintendo hit with donkey kong<br>meanwhile all this is going on most of<br>the arcade machines that we know and<br>remember today are based in japan over<br>in the united states in southern<br>california they start working on the<br>atari 2600 which was probably one of the<br>most successful first home consoles<br>it takes off like crazy after that<br>distributors start treating games as<br>something of a novelty toy and they<br>start pumping money into it without<br>really any consideration for the quality<br>of the games that they're putting out<br>now for those of you familiar with game<br>history there is a massive crash in the<br>early 80s as far as the game industry is<br>concerned it went from making buckets of<br>money to making none<br>consumers were returning their games<br>tenfold and a lot of this is attributed<br>to<br>the game et<br>everyone remembers et the film et phone<br>home no one remembers et the game at<br>least not for good reasons they made<br>millions of copies of et to promote the<br>film and then following on from that<br>they return all these games the games<br>industry tanks at least in north america<br>and there is a staggering period in the<br>early 80s from about 81 until maybe 83.<br>next into the arena steps nintendo with<br>the nes or the nintendo entertainment<br>system which was one of the<br>probably the first major home console to<br>gain traction worldwide and not just in<br>the us and that is where we get super<br>mario brothers immediately following<br>that games blow up again the home<br>console becomes the place and the<br>arcades begin a slow and gradual decline<br>as the home experience begins to match<br>and eventually outpace the arcade<br>experience following in the steps of<br>nintendo you have sega sega release the<br>master system and then following that<br>genesis nintendo released the nintendo<br>entertainment system and then the very<br>well named super nintendo entertainment<br>system while this is all happening pcs<br>have gotten a lot smaller in the last 20<br>years uh pcs are now in the home and<br>what you have are these enthusiasts<br>working on pcs and starting to program<br>their own games from there these<br>developers would eventually take over<br>the mantle in the 90s and we go from 2d<br>to 3d we go from 2d sprites to read<br>real-time 3d models and we start to hit<br>the area that i grew up with and that<br>many of my peers grew up with and that<br>some of you may have even grown up with<br>we had the playstation we had the<br>nintendo 64 we hit the saturn<br>now while the arcades are dying a slow<br>death<br>to put it nicely home consoles start to<br>explode and video games become something<br>of the cutting edge for real-time<br>technology some of the technology used<br>in games starts to be used in films and<br>vice versa skipping forward to the let's<br>say late 2010s maybe early<br>naughties is probably the appropriate<br>term pcs become more widespread they've<br>become more affordable suddenly they're<br>in everyone's homes now that they're in<br>everyone's homes everyone has access to<br>the tools<br>that were used for game development so<br>you start to see the emergence of<br>independent games<br>games produced without major studio<br>distribution or studio backing or<br>funding<br>and you start to see things like<br>probably one of the most well-known<br>examples is fears or maybe super meat<br>boy games produced by teams of two to<br>three as opposed to 20 to 30 or even 100<br>to 200 and we reached today i'm aware<br>there's a very condensed games history<br>but where are we now<br>games are still very much at the cutting<br>edge you have vr you have ar you have<br>home consoles you have pc<br>you're starting to explore different<br>uses of video game technology in<br>different fields for example the use of<br>the unreal engine and film and you're<br>starting to see people<br>who probably had very little interest in<br>games using games as a medium to tell<br>the stories that they want to tell so<br>hopefully you found something<br>interesting in that very condensed<br>history of video games if you have any<br>further questions feel free to contact<br>us here to heading walker school of<br>design innovation we look forward to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
