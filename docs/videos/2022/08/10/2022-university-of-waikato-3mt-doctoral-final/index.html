for this evening<br>before I explain the order of events and<br>and how this event will run I thought<br>I'd share an experience with you<br>I recently went to the movie Maverick<br>Top Gun<br>have you seen it it's two hours and 11<br>minutes of non-stop action<br>as a professor of geography and<br>assistant Vice Chancellor sustainability<br>I couldn't even begin to calculate the<br>carbon emissions<br>but I could analyze the movie's themes<br>such as<br>economies dedicated to war and built on<br>hegemonic masculinities softened up with<br>a bit of heteronormative romance<br>or revolving around holding up the<br>United States geopolitical World<br>position as a superpower<br>who's going to save all of us from the<br>bad people<br>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie<br>I enjoyed the obvious performance of<br>such themes I also enjoyed that I could<br>put these themes into words<br>being an academic<br>doing research as our presenters will<br>show tonight teaches us to analyze and<br>represent our arguments<br>even if they're about movies that we<br>take our dad to see<br>universities as all of us know here<br>tonight<br>are places where where we can test and<br>contest ideas<br>the other thing about that movie that<br>reinforced for me is that one needs to<br>focus single-mindedly on the issues and<br>doing a thesis a PhD thesis is just like<br>this it has to be at the Forefront of<br>your mind<br>so as the MC for the next maybe two<br>hours to and 11 minutes 2 hours and 11<br>minutes please sit back enjoy our<br>students as they present their<br>incredible research projects it promises<br>to be non-stop action<br>um but first I'd like to invite<br>Professor Karen Bryan our dean of tamata<br>kairanga school of graduate research who<br>will extend a warm welcome to your given<br>all right just make sure<br>TOA<br>uh<br>a very warm welcome indeed to the three<br>minute thesis competition for 2020 2022<br>sorry<br>Coke hiring Brian Toko inoue I'm Karen<br>Bryan I'm the new Dean of tamata<br>kairangi I'm the school of graduate<br>research and um well at tamata karangi<br>we are we're kind of helpers we help our<br>divisions the faculty and all our<br>academic supervisors from around the<br>university to guide our doctoral<br>students through their research Journey<br>to the final completion<br>and we have 600 more than 600 students<br>working throughout the university their<br>projects are very diverse and I'm<br>learning about them a lot even from<br>areas outside my own which is science<br>um and we help them a lot not just uh<br>through motivation and that kind of<br>thing but also the general skills they<br>need to succeed and it's not the skills<br>that are happening while they're<br>enrolled in their PHD but also the ones<br>that they need afterwards<br>our graduates go into a really wide<br>range of high-level jobs and I say high<br>level because that's the added skills<br>that they have allows them to get into<br>those jobs and quite a few of them end<br>up overseas we have graduates who've<br>become CEOs Chief scientists politicians<br>and even academics<br>well all sorts but one thing in common<br>is that they can think through complex<br>problems and they can find pathways<br>through them for themselves but they<br>also learn that to do that for people<br>around them we're really proud of our<br>doctoral program<br>um the reason that we support so many<br>doctoral students at waikato is that<br>they form the Cornerstone of our<br>research strength and reputation they<br>are the foundation<br>they're really Innovative and they have<br>the chance and the focus to be<br>Innovative the books the papers the<br>Theses they're writing they'll be read<br>and valued by people all over the world<br>our students get citations in readers<br>from everywhere<br>um helping our relatively small<br>University allowing it to bat before but<br>about higher than its weight we do<br>really well in rankings considering our<br>size<br>um we're also known in the community for<br>really good quality relevant research<br>our students are really connected to the<br>region<br>they are often funded by our very<br>generous donors and our industry<br>Partners quite a few of them went to<br>waikato themselves<br>now back to this event<br>of the skills that graduates need the<br>ability to tell a research story and it<br>is a story you're telling when you're up<br>here on presenting in a captivating way<br>that can reach a really wide range of<br>people and bring them forward is really<br>really important<br>Garner the days that we can sit on our<br>Ivory Towers and work on interesting but<br>kind of obscure problems<br>today we're facing a bit of a crisis a<br>climate crisis a biodiversity crisis a<br>world with pandemics<br>kind of unstable Politics the economics<br>are unsure it's kind of a day when we<br>really need all hands to the pump<br>and our doctoral students are clever<br>they can think in really innovative ways<br>and but they need to be able to convince<br>you that they're part of that solution<br>they're sort of those future engines of<br>innovation<br>which brings me to this particular event<br>the thesis uh I mean the three-minute<br>thesis is about the art of communicating<br>research to an interested but not<br>necessarily specialized audience it's a<br>chance also to celebrate the exciting<br>types of research we're doing at waikato<br>and so it's our pleasure to present you<br>this research tonight<br>um it's not it's not just a waikato<br>event why Kato event it's actually a<br>global competition now<br>it originated at the University of<br>Queensland in Australia in 2008 so it's<br>more than 10 years old now<br>the idea came came for it when they were<br>having a big drought<br>and the people were recommended that<br>they shouldn't stay in the shower too<br>long because use up water and in fact<br>they should only have a shower for three<br>minutes so lots of people got egg timers<br>um to time their three-minute showers<br>and the dean of the University of<br>Queensland the dean of the graduate<br>school so me I guess in that position<br>um was thinking about this having their<br>three-minute shower and thought wow we<br>could have a competition just like this<br>well it's now held over 600 universities<br>and institutions and in 59 different<br>countries<br>and in 2016 it expanded from just being<br>trans Tasman to include a number of<br>Asian universities<br>and so now it's called officially the<br>Asia Pacific 3mt competition and that's<br>where the winner<br>of tonight's competition will be headed<br>virtually in October<br>okay and the one interesting and cool<br>thing about 3mt is the rules are the<br>same all over the world they have just<br>three minutes not three minutes and one<br>second not three minutes mine they have<br>three minutes and no more they can't try<br>twice just the ones it's only one shot<br>they have one static PowerPoint slide<br>which should literally be tortured for<br>me because I love animations I'm not<br>allowed to use that and it needs to be<br>pitched to a non-specialist intelligent<br>audience and they will be judged by a<br>panel of academic and non-academic<br>people looking at the three areas of the<br>three Criterion comprehension engagement<br>and communication<br>so now I'll hand you back to our MC<br>Professor Johnson who'll introduce you<br>to our judges and explain the details of<br>tonight's competition before I do I want<br>to thank you all very much for coming<br>we're delighted to host you delighted<br>that you've come to hear our students<br>and supporting them and to support them<br>um I'd also like to thank the advisors<br>that have been putting so much work into<br>this event and the events team at the<br>the Arts Center and they've been put a<br>huge amount of work into this and of<br>course our judges who Linda is going to<br>introduce much more eloquently than I<br>thank you Professor Brian I will go<br>right into introducing the judges we are<br>delighted to have you here thank you<br>again from me<br>is committed to improving outcomes for<br>Maori and and supporting treaty<br>relationships holds a number of<br>directorships including director of<br>tainoi group Holdings Meridian energy in<br>Auckland Airport Tania is also a member<br>of our waitangi tribunal the deputy<br>chair of waitangi national trusts and<br>chairs the sustainable Seas National<br>Science challenge as a member of the<br>Deep South National Science challenge<br>board as well<br>thank you so much for being here<br>uh and another judge Marlene Julian<br>Marlene has four uh many years I've been<br>involved in the not-for-profit sector<br>having been a trustee for the Brian<br>Perry charitable trust uh formerly Peery<br>foundation for 30 years and Marlene was<br>instrumental in establishing poet the<br>peri-outdoor education trust Remains the<br>chair of that organization<br>uh this this particular organizations<br>working with low decile secondary<br>schools through engaging them with<br>outdoor experiences so thank you very<br>much for coming and being here tonight<br>and judging<br>um the third judge Keith Gallagher is<br>is with us tonight thank you Keith for<br>being here works as an electrics<br>engineer and wire up wairarapa has<br>worked in wairarapa England Auckland and<br>now in<br>as Electronics technical leader<br>associated with the university for a<br>number of years currently the<br>engineering Advisory Board chairperson<br>and and contains another a number of<br>community roles including Trustee of the<br>Galaga charitable trust and Gallagher<br>Foundation importantly he's a husband<br>and father of three busy children as<br>well that's wonderful so a round of<br>thank you so much for being here and<br>making this happen and spending your<br>evening with us we also have another<br>very important person here as Professor<br>Brian mentioned it's only three minutes<br>and so we have a time keeper Andrea<br>Carney sitting down here<br>with the very important iPad now the<br>iPad runs down the minutes so our<br>speakers here our presenters will be<br>able to see that iPad<br>when it gets to 30 minutes before the<br>end of that<br>Andrea will hold up this an orange card<br>so they know that the time is near the<br>end so thank you very much Andrea for<br>being that time keeper<br>let me explain the<br>now the winner of this evening will<br>receive the professor John D mccrore<br>Memorial Awards<br>and one thousand dollars to put towards<br>their research<br>the winner will also compete against<br>candidates if we who as we've heard from<br>more than 40 other tertiary institutions<br>and this is in the Asia Pacific virtual<br>3mt semi-finals<br>um and that's due for Monday the 26th of<br>September<br>potentially also the Asia Pacific 3mt<br>finals on Wednesday the 19th of October<br>now the runner-up will also receive a<br>prize five hundred dollars<br>towards to put towards their research<br>there is another prize and it's the<br>People's Choice of prize so you will see<br>in the program you'll also see around<br>the building on the walls a QR code<br>and after we've had the presentations we<br>invite you to vote for your favorite<br>presentation and you'll and we'll do<br>that during the break and I'll remind<br>you before we do break that that's one<br>of our jobs to do over the break as<br>you're deliberating and talking about<br>the competition will run like this so<br>each fireless with their three minutes<br>um each each file is of course has been<br>practicing long and hard<br>um I will call the finalists through<br>one of each file is one by one the<br>timekeeper will be ready<br>and we'll move through them fairly<br>quickly through that and I must let you<br>know that one of our presenters tonight<br>cannot be here is home isolating but<br>will be with us virtually<br>to talk about their research and that is<br>Christopher Dunn so unfortunately<br>Christopher can't be included in part of<br>the competition but still wishes to<br>share their research so I'm really<br>delighted that Christopher can do that<br>in terms of housekeeping in the building<br>if you please check your cell phones are<br>off we very much do not need to<br>interrupt our three minutes with<br>someone's phone beeping or ringing<br>uh also please keep still as the<br>presenters are delivering their three<br>minutes of thesis<br>if there is an event that we need to<br>evacuate the building<br>please follow the instructions of your<br>crew or the staff here follow the exit<br>signs out into the foyer and then out<br>into the concrete pad you'll be directed<br>outside there the bathrooms are<br>opposites the refreshment area down the<br>main area and left if you need to use<br>right we're at that particular time<br>where I can start to introduce each<br>speaker<br>so<br>I am delighted to be able to bring<br>forward<br>the very first Speaker just checking<br>that I've got all everything ready yes<br>um our first Speaker tonight is Chris<br>Koto and good evening whether it be<br>potatoes kumara rice or bread most of us<br>have a favorite starch filled food that<br>we truly love surprisingly kiwi fruit<br>Vines also love starch so much so that<br>every Autumn they fill themselves up<br>with starch then have a nice long sleep<br>over winter and when they wake up again<br>in Spring they use their starch reserves<br>to grow new tissues including leaves<br>roots and flowers<br>in this way low starch content in<br>kiwifruit wood can limit flour<br>production in Spring reducing fruit<br>yields and lowering profitability<br>what you can see on my slide and not<br>what most people think some crazy new<br>varieties of fruit they are in fact<br>cross-sectional slices of kiwifruit wood<br>each no thicker than a human hair<br>blood slices have been stained and then<br>imaged under a microscope<br>in the top left iodine has been used to<br>stain starch black the beige regions are<br>tough wood fibers and the white circles<br>are xylem vessels which are essentially<br>water pipes<br>well this makes for a cool picture we<br>want to be able to use these images to<br>quantify the amount of starch stored in<br>the wood<br>we can do this using machine learning<br>based tools to process and simplify<br>these images at a far greater rate than<br>any human could<br>an example of this is shown in the<br>bottom left where an image has been<br>simplified down to three colors black<br>yellow and white to extract quantitative<br>data we simply tell you the number of<br>pixels of each color in the image<br>this by itself can give us very useful<br>information but it's only half the story<br>to get the full picture of what's going<br>on in the wood we also need to know what<br>the starch storage capacity is is it may<br>not necessarily be filled out due to<br>adverse growing conditions<br>we can assist less using a combination<br>of two different stains and you can see<br>this in the top right<br>here cells that can store starch appear<br>blue purple althoughs it cannot store<br>starch appear magenta red<br>again we can use machine learning based<br>tools to process these images and<br>extract quantitative data<br>in my research I plan to use these<br>techniques to assist how environmental<br>conditions and management practices<br>influence what anatomy and how this<br>affects starch storage capacity the<br>total amount of starch and the<br>proportion of the capacity that's<br>actually filled up<br>by providing these insights to Kiwi<br>Fruit Growers they will be able to<br>maximize their wood starch storage<br>resulting in increased flower production<br>higher fruit yields and increased<br>profits<br>it is my hope that this will further<br>strengthen the 2.7 billion dollar New<br>Zealand kiwi fruit industry and give<br>both kiwifruit Growers and consumers yet<br>one more reason to truly love starch I'm<br>foreign<br>if you need to chat or move around<br>between contestants you can absolutely<br>do that while we get ready for the next<br>one<br>um<br>it's a tough job for the judges as they<br>make their notes<br>yeah<br>wonderful to be underway<br>there will be an intermission after all<br>the presenters have gone through their<br>we're ready for our next presenter<br>I'm delighted to welcome Lakshmi musi to<br>it can be used to build houses cars<br>spacecrafts and even human body parts<br>the answer is 3D printing a 3D printers<br>mechanism is not very different from<br>that of your desktop printers a desktop<br>printer creates a digital file and<br>deposits ink onto a paper to form a<br>document whereas a 3D printer reads a<br>computer design and deposits material<br>onto the print bed to form a physical<br>object nearly anything you can imagine<br>can now be turned into a computer design<br>and can be 3D printed<br>as the 3D printing industry grows so<br>does the use of plastic as a raw<br>material for 3D printing the 3D printing<br>industry is already responsible for<br>generating 5000 tons of plastic waste<br>this is the issue that my PhD addresses<br>the aim of my research is to develop<br>strong sustainable and smart materials<br>that can be used for 3D printing<br>I work with a compostable plastic which<br>is made out of renewable resources<br>called polylactide<br>polylactide however by itself is not<br>strong enough to 3D print components<br>such as your car doors or aircraft<br>panels my research focuses on<br>reinforcing polylactide with plant<br>fibers to maintain its sustainability at<br>the same time improve its strength to 3D<br>print such strong components<br>at this stage I was not only able to<br>develop but also test some material<br>combinations that had almost doubled the<br>strength from where I started in the<br>coming months I will be working on<br>enhancing this strength further while<br>optimizing the methods to produce these<br>materials but my research does not end<br>there I will also be looking at smart<br>Behavior mechanisms in these materials<br>now you might be wondering what makes<br>this material smart how does a material<br>qualify to be called smart as I said<br>earlier these materials are made of<br>plant fibers and plants are inherently<br>intelligent they respond to changes in<br>their surroundings you must have noticed<br>how some leaves or flowers open and<br>close as a response to sunlight or rain<br>what if I told you that our materials<br>could do the same thing<br>an example can be seen in my slide on<br>the bottom left side here where a flat<br>structure was 3D printed in our lab<br>using the sustainable materials<br>when this flat structure comes in<br>contact with water it unfolds itself<br>into a table<br>this is just one example of how we can<br>use sustainable materials for smart<br>manufacturing I believe that the sky is<br>the limit and we can transform all our<br>manufacturing methods to be more<br>sustainable while being smarter through<br>wonderful thank you Lakshmi wonderful<br>research how fantastic<br>these are inspiring<br>horrific<br>right<br>how's the feeling of relaxation Chris<br>Heartbreakers heartbeat is coming down<br>wonderful<br>it's all so excellent to see everyone's<br>supporters here thank you supporters<br>supervisors family whanau friends<br>terrific<br>experience<br>what<br>right we are now ready for our third<br>presentation<br>please welcome<br>are you curious about New Zealand<br>Chinese media content and Chinese<br>communities preferred political parties<br>here's my story when I was a community<br>radio broadcaster at Hamilton around<br>2020 election time and the audience is<br>called in to ask about their interest<br>political news but they couldn't fund<br>the information on which political<br>parties benefit for themselves and they<br>didn't want to follow their kids to vote<br>for the specific political party<br>and those experience make me to explore<br>the Chinese diaspora media use and<br>political engagement in otiola New<br>Zealand<br>I'm using the mixed research method the<br>quantitative research completed last<br>year with more than 200 respondents and<br>I'm doing qualitative research with over<br>30 participants to express their ideas<br>experiences opinions about media use and<br>political engagement in New Zealand<br>and there are two innovations first of<br>all it's about social media WeChat<br>WeChat is kind of WhatsApp and in my<br>study over 90 of participants used or<br>using recharge uh in 2017 both labor and<br>National Party launched WeChat account<br>late released some articles news party<br>policies to help those migrants who<br>can't understand English to help them<br>access the information<br>the second one is about voting the same<br>results with uh past studies which is<br>Chinese communities still prefer the<br>National Party other than other parties<br>however there is a split for the<br>preferred prime minister<br>why I hope and have fun answer in a<br>further qualitative study<br>so I hope this study can help Chinese<br>new zealanders to understand the diverse<br>media sphere in Australia New Zealand to<br>help them develop an independent<br>thinking on government policies party<br>policies and voting decisions<br>and thank you<br>imagine saying that's excellent<br>wonderful<br>that brings us to that<br>um<br>three speakers<br>um<br>it's an intense time as we consider each<br>presentation<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>I'm very delighted to welcome Kimberly<br>my research on a topic that very few<br>people want to talk about<br>it's a list of important things but<br>governments tend to sweep it under the<br>rug<br>it's too complicated they say<br>and it is to be fair<br>but 34 of all new zealanders are<br>suffering from this health issue with<br>huge inequity at 51 Maori and 71<br>Pacifica all suffering from this health<br>issue and our rural areas suffer even<br>more with less resources or support<br>services and<br>it's not even just this health issue<br>it's what this health issue leads into<br>it's diabetes heart disease stroke<br>cancer depression anxiety social<br>isolation spiritual disconnect early<br>death<br>and suicide<br>this health issue cripples individuals<br>quality of life memories and whanau are<br>torn apart by losing their loved ones<br>too soon communities are struggling and<br>the health system can't cope<br>it will crumble if this is not addressed<br>yet it's preventable treatable<br>reversible whatever you want to call it<br>either way we need to talk about the<br>health issue that is obesity<br>now the Ministry of Health position<br>general practice is best suited to<br>deliver this care you know they see<br>their patients a lot over time and it<br>takes time to lose weight it it makes<br>sense<br>but despite weight loss options<br>available obesity rates have continued<br>to rise<br>and the quality of life of our people<br>our children our makapuna has only<br>gotten worse<br>something is not working<br>my research looked to find out what was<br>going wrong in this space<br>so I interviewed GPS nurses Maori health<br>professionals and compared their views<br>with their patients clients and rural<br>community members and expecting to find<br>a whole bunch of little issues that<br>could be nice and easily fixed but no<br>now what we found was a far bigger<br>problem<br>turns out<br>most of the clinicians and clients<br>actually disagree with the Ministry of<br>Health and they want a specialist<br>obesity service located outside of<br>general practice<br>my research Works to bring the views of<br>our Ministry of Health our clients and<br>our clinicians together so we can make a<br>comprehensive multi-layered culturally<br>safe solution to improve health outcomes<br>for all of us<br>my research is vital at reducing<br>inequity and is currently being used as<br>evidence in the New Zealand Health<br>reforms<br>my research along with the voices of<br>these rural communities will ensure that<br>our future Generations don't have to<br>Kimberly awesome thank you so much well<br>done<br>good<br>thought-provoking<br>presentations<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>well we are ready for the last<br>contestant<br>um as I mentioned before we do have<br>someone zooming into us but they aren't<br>part of the competition<br>but please welcome the last presenter<br>foreign<br>the story of childhood homelessness is<br>my story<br>I experienced homelessness as the child<br>of happily married parents with<br>full-time jobs<br>not The Stereotype associated with<br>homelessness and yet this experience and<br>the associated trauma means the<br>likelihood that I would be here studying<br>at the doctoral level is so low that I<br>am a statistical anomaly<br>homelessness is an adverse childhood<br>experience and like various forms of<br>abuse and neglect causes far-reaching<br>trauma<br>in 2021 there are a series of headlines<br>that showed that the issue of<br>homelessness is seen in New Zealand<br>Society we know that there are New<br>Zealand children living in<br>cars on the streets and an overcrowded<br>or emergency housing<br>however this courage this coverage is<br>very reminiscent of the old adage that<br>children should be seen and not heard<br>the media is showing we see that there<br>is an issue with childhood homelessness<br>but we are not hearing the voices of<br>my research<br>is about<br>the impact that childhood homelessness<br>has on education and this is based on<br>the acknowledged Gateway that education<br>has on the positive impact on life<br>course outcomes<br>my research is in narrative inquiry<br>designed to capture the stories of these<br>children<br>I will conduct semi-structured<br>conversations with these children with<br>an integrated art project to be painted<br>as with talk so that they can share<br>their stories the children children aged<br>8 to 12 who have experienced<br>homelessness<br>This research is important because these<br>children need to be heard they matter<br>and the more that we understand the more<br>we're going to be able to support them<br>it is not these children's fault that<br>they are homeless and yet they are the<br>ones that stand to pay the highest price<br>it is imperative that we give these<br>children a voice and power this is about<br>Justice<br>it is time<br>to give these children a voice and a<br>place in the conversation because the<br>this will ensure that they are empowered<br>and we are empowered to support them to<br>help them help themselves<br>because the only way to capture these<br>stories stories like mine is to listen<br>look at that<br>well done thank you so much<br>um wonderful to hear that research as<br>well I mentioned before that we do have<br>someone joining us on screen I'll just<br>give the judges a bit of time to make<br>their notes and then we'll cross to<br>Christopher Dunn<br>um<br>foreign<br>wonderful<br>now with the um<br>the use of our Zoom technology will<br>look at things frustrating to more<br>people on this slide I wouldn't think<br>their problem is<br>well they were doing an important work<br>on mobile prices<br>which they thought had plenty of<br>charging them enough to get the job done<br>but don't you hold it the references it<br>has 20 charge left in it and then<br>something remains to ice and goes flat<br>that you want to buy the capacity bars<br>are supposed to give you an idea of how<br>many charging Cycles the batteries have<br>left in them and hence how many more<br>ideas of Life the car has left<br>amazing having the punishment if it is<br>really wants to know how long the<br>bachelor empowering it is going to last<br>and unfortunately the current prediction<br>tell us approximately how long the<br>battery will last so the cardiologist<br>has to build in a large safety factor<br>and replace the battery long before it<br>has been worn out<br>so despite Decades of chemical and<br>Engineering research prediction of<br>battery life is still unsurprisingly in<br>exact science why is this<br>well I'm in this because the voltage and<br>current measurements the researchers use<br>to design a theoretical circuit models<br>that go into battle Management Systems<br>have been named in the wrong place and<br>in the wrong way<br>so my connection environmental regiments<br>using charge discharge waves and<br>frequencies that correspond to the<br>actual usage cycles of rear batteries<br>that are charged so damnly only from<br>rookly now unfortunately these<br>frequencies are very low and modulants<br>are difficult to make and take a long<br>time but if you can make these<br>measurements we'll get into the region<br>of the graph that you can see on the<br>slide with a question mark in it so<br>we're looking in this region because we<br>know that it contains a lot of valuable<br>information corresponds to the Daily or<br>weekly voltage cycles of real<br>rechargeable batteries and because I<br>know that nobody has looked here before<br>now I've been doing this for just over<br>18 months now and I think I'm getting<br>pretty good at it and my colleagues and<br>I consumes this information to construct<br>battery models and management systems<br>that are much more realistic than the<br>ones being used at the moment<br>to stop your cell phones and laptops<br>from dying and we thought they still<br>have plenty of charging them to give you<br>more confidence when you're going to buy<br>that used electric vehicle<br>and to stop vulnerable patients having<br>to go into hospital to have bad<br>thank you Christopher<br>um that brings the 3mt PHD thesis<br>presentation to an end but before we<br>go to our intermission I'd like to<br>invite all the finalists to the stage<br>for a robust Round of Applause so please<br>foreign<br>do we have a seat and I'll tell I'll<br>tell everyone what's happening next but<br>you can you can feel the tension<br>released from the room can't you it's a<br>our people are much more in a happy<br>State now without having to worry about<br>the three minutes and what they're<br>saying within three minutes so a really<br>wonderful round of presentations thank<br>you everyone<br>now we won't go to an intermission there<br>will be light Refreshments just set up<br>in the playhouse for you and the cash<br>bar is open but before we go there I'd<br>like to remind everyone<br>to use the QR code to vote for The<br>People's Choice so don't forget this and<br>we have about till about seven o'clock<br>till we're due back in here so you've<br>got make sure you do that within the<br>first 20 minutes<br>what we will do is when we return<br>um<br>when we come back here we will be<br>treated to another presentation the<br>winner of the Masters 3mt Jesse Barnett<br>will present their particular<br>award-winning presentation to us<br>so um and then after we hear from Jessie<br>then we will<br>allocate prizes to the winners<br>so thank you very much everyone and<br>thank you presenters we'll see you back<br>here at seven o'clock<br>foreign<br>just<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>welcome back to the final part of this<br>evening's event so I hope people got a<br>chance to eat and drink something and<br>catch up when we left in the first part<br>of the evening we could feel the tension<br>just<br>float away from our contestants and now<br>we feel it's back again so we've got to<br>that part of the evening where we're<br>waiting<br>to find out who the winners are before<br>we do that however I'm delighted to be<br>able to introduce our three Mt Masters<br>winner<br>so please<br>um Jesse Burnett<br>please welcome Jesse to the stage and<br>thank you time keeper again for keeping<br>how many people here have been so tired<br>that you've started making mistakes<br>maybe too tired to drive<br>how many of you have been so tired that<br>you've truly struggled to get out of bed<br>that just being awake and thinking basic<br>thoughts was exhausting you may have<br>experienced this if you've had covid or<br>tiredness and fatigue are interesting<br>because on the one hand tiredness is<br>such an everyday experience and on the<br>other severe fatigue can be<br>devastatingly debilitating<br>yet we tend to conflate these two things<br>and struggle both to acknowledge and<br>tell these stories<br>how many stories can you think of in<br>which tiredness or fatigue play a<br>central role<br>I would actually say quite a few<br>the trick is it doesn't tend to be<br>explicit we tend to locate fatigue in<br>the margins in a passing comment a<br>metaphor or the overall tiredness of the<br>language used<br>take for example kafka's short story The<br>Metamorphosis the one where the guy<br>wakes up as an oversized insect<br>we can think of this story in a number<br>of ways but really we have the story of<br>a young man The Sole Provider for his<br>family who awakes when wanting to find<br>that he's overslept and his body has<br>betrayed him such that he cannot get out<br>of bed to go fulfill his role as a<br>productive member of society in the<br>workforce<br>as he struggles to get out of bed he<br>fears he'll be blamed a perfectly<br>healthy malingerer<br>he blames himself what's the use lying<br>idle in bed<br>when his family and boss see his State<br>their support is not forthcoming<br>if you've been following the recent news<br>on Long covet or other fatiguing<br>conditions some of these narrative<br>threads might sound familiar<br>in my research I compare modernist<br>Fiction with those um kind of recent<br>newspaper articles on long covid and<br>patients are regularly quoted citing<br>these same fears of lack of support<br>struggles returning to work disbelief<br>and self-blame<br>in a time when long covid is affecting<br>so many people and other fatiguing<br>conditions are as well<br>Stories We Tell help shape experiences<br>and reality<br>not only do we rely on the language of<br>story to convey our experiences but it<br>also helps to inform the perspective and<br>expectations of the rest of our society<br>it helps inform the perspectives of<br>medical professionals politicians<br>employers friends family<br>and in the last 100 years the stories we<br>we need to pay attention to the stories<br>we've told in order to help shape and<br>learn from the stories we're going to<br>tell now as always stories matter thank<br>you<br>thank you so much Jesse wonderful to<br>hear that and too and congratulations<br>again for your uh for your win for the<br>Masters 3mt<br>so we do come to that time in the<br>evening where we get to find out<br>um the um the way in which the judges<br>have allocated the prizes<br>um we do have a chance now to get some<br>generic feedback for everyone<br>but also from me I would like to say to<br>all of the contestants well done it was<br>amazing and inspiring and being here on<br>the stage and working through nerves and<br>delivering your presentations was<br>fantastic so well done everyone so I'll<br>at this stage I'll invite<br>um but honey to do the general feedback<br>and then we'll go through presenting the<br>prizes from People's Choice to second to<br>uh first but we'll also discuss this<br>beautiful award that they're getting as<br>well<br>foreign<br>it's my privilege to give some feedback<br>on behalf of the judging panel and uh<br>I'm not sure that I can keep it to three<br>minutes but I'll give it a go<br>um we were so impressed by all of the<br>presenters this evening and we recognize<br>that an enormous amount of work goes<br>into that three minutes and that you've<br>probably been practicing for ages and<br>um in in preparing for this for this<br>evening and<br>um how impressive it is that you can get<br>up and recite<br>uh for three minutes the presentation<br>that you've put so much preparation into<br>so<br>um congratulations to all of you on your<br>memory work and your preparation that's<br>gone into this evening<br>it was really difficult to judge uh<br>there were such a variety of topics<br>really different<br>topics and they're difficult to compare<br>we recognize that you're at different<br>stages of your research as well so while<br>some may be able to talk more about<br>conclusions others are still sex sign<br>posting or signaling where the research<br>is going and so we took that into<br>account and we also recognize that with<br>this competition puts you well out of<br>your comfort zone to have to come up<br>here and to distill what is quite<br>complex complicated research<br>questions<br>into a three-minute simple language<br>recital of your work so congratulations<br>to you all for what you've achieved we<br>thought it was utterly fascinating and<br>interesting and really impressive so<br>irrespective of the outcome of the<br>awards you should<br>um consider that it's an incredible<br>achievement in that we were all totally<br>impressed with what you delivered this<br>evening also a word for Christopher who<br>was online we thought that was a that he<br>made a great effort as well and it was a<br>real shame that he wasn't able to<br>participate<br>um so on behalf of the judges our<br>sincere thanks and congratulations for<br>what you've all achieved it was<br>absolutely our privilege to witness your<br>presentations and we we think you were<br>foreign<br>thank you very much so we get to that<br>point now<br>and I would like to invite Marlene to<br>the stage to first present<br>I'm glad I don't have an envelope to rip<br>um so this year the People's Choice<br>Award goes to Kris Kramer Walter for his<br>oh I know this is<br>congratulations Chris<br>um<br>now I'm going to invite Keith to come to<br>the stage and present the runner-up<br>Awards remember this award is the 500<br>towards research<br>um so Keith please come and<br>um I'm pleased to present this award um<br>this was the<br>hottest contended award between the<br>judges and we found it worked out quite<br>well because Chris was the person we<br>argued about to be honest<br>um Kimberly<br>let her up<br>congratulations Kimberly<br>um<br>very exciting here<br>um before we do announce the winner I'd<br>like to invite widumu for key to come<br>back and to actually tell us more about<br>the meaning and significance of this<br>beautiful award that John D McCraw Award<br>winner is a research associate with us<br>at farewell<br>working with other researchers such as<br>Bruce Clarkson and a deep deep interest<br>and connection to the fenua here to the<br>place<br>and around so I'm really delighted you<br>can be here to tell us more about the<br>award but do tell us about that<br>I think I was one of those students at<br>high school that might have got a PhD<br>with a box uh past high school with<br>difficulty<br>with a for absence<br>anyway Kelly everyone I'm for those who<br>may have remembered my late father<br>haripuki he was the cobarter of this uh<br>this institution this University<br>um but I do belong together<br>I talked about the actual original old<br>name of this land<br>which literally the relabel of voltipski<br>Street<br>to be called putikitiki which was the<br>Gully that extended where the Hamilton<br>East school as well it was actually<br>delay with the entire block<br>of lead and the meaning behind the name<br>actually refers to the the top knot<br>IRA and the feathers that we collected<br>the tail feathers that were collected<br>from Lee huya and there's a other birds<br>as well so that is the actual name of<br>I just got to briefly talk about<br>professor<br>John Davidson mccrawal<br>I first met Professor McCraw at the<br>waikato University five me and another<br>friend of mine Dante bonica we were<br>demonstrating<br>uh for a very pet gallery of uh very<br>interested uh people of the community<br>the age of Technology of Stowe tool<br>making<br>and making Stone answers<br>so for a good six hours I said I'll let<br>that hard slate floor on the second<br>Gallery there while John was said he'll<br>have very comfortable leather chair a<br>little corner just watching uh my every<br>move<br>and then the conversation started from<br>there<br>how science could actually work together<br>and the narratives and the the analysis<br>that we looked we looked into our<br>traditional stories like um how did you<br>know from that perspective that I was<br>able to bring to Professor mccrroll were<br>able to work collaboratively around the<br>science aspects of things geology the<br>soil mapping of soils around along the<br>riverbank<br>and uh Joel really professable crew<br>really inspired me he was also one of<br>the foundation professors of this<br>University along with Professor uh<br>uh James Ritchie as well Mr James Richie<br>was a wonderful mentor to many of our<br>young people with waikato Taylor<br>um the<br>the ticket that I carved here was<br>entirely carved with stone tools but<br>I've always caused my mind to go to the<br>British Museum and swap swap it for the<br>original for the original bring it home<br>but it's a symbol of the following<br>it was generally held by the talking<br>who was almost like the equivalent of a<br>professor<br>so it's a tribute to the scholarship to<br>the aspirations<br>of our many of our PhD students in many<br>ways they they are the Mavericks of this<br>world<br>and that from every way of thinking is<br>something we should be encouraging and<br>cultivating<br>you know they have that sense of uh<br>being able to challenge oneself to think<br>outside the square and to enjoy the<br>learning pathway that we do<br>so the trophy that is here today is is a<br>it's worthy to acknowledge the manner<br>uh that goes with the the type of<br>research that<br>these years have proceeded tonight<br>I'm really really always impressed with<br>what I see<br>I'll leave with some of the wise words<br>of my late father Harry<br>the more one knows the less they know<br>so it's all true life one of the things<br>that I always enjoy is the always the<br>opportunity to be humble would love to<br>learn and to take on new ideas at every<br>opportunity<br>so it's me kill a tattoo and I'll hand<br>if you move along and on get you to stay<br>here while we do this next part of it<br>um and I'm really delighted to welcome<br>back Tania to introduce uh to announce<br>the winner<br>foreign<br>the judges were unanimous and deciding<br>that the winner of the 3mt doctoral<br>with the trophy as well yeah<br>we'll just make some<br>final remarks and then I'll keep<br>and congratulations everyone it really<br>was an impressive<br>um array of research and presentations<br>so we're really delighted and<br>totally impressed as as the judges were<br>um it's my pleasure now to bring our<br>evening to an end to wrap up proceedings<br>and I want to thank everyone thank the<br>judges for their incredible work tonight<br>uh never easy doing this job and we<br>could hear them debating<br>um and Talking Through upstairs so thank<br>you so much thank you all the supporters<br>of the speakers who have come here<br>tonight uh parents whanau friends<br>supervisors uh wonderful to have that<br>support here with our presenters<br>um a huge thank you to tamata karangi<br>staff gosh they need their own Round of<br>Applause<br>it's a um it certainly is a big event to<br>put on and to make sure it's done<br>correctly to those rules for the<br>presenters to go on and then compete in<br>the next stage<br>and the and the event isn't really over<br>yet so Tina was telling me that she now<br>has to organize<br>um<br>recordings of the of the winners and<br>then to get that into the to the to the<br>next event so thank you so much<br>um<br>as whittemu has said you know we need to<br>be Mavericks and to continue the theme I<br>started with with Top Gun it has been a<br>top evening we have stretched uh the<br>ways in which we think about certain<br>Knowledge from our research projects we<br>know that you are breaking new ground<br>which is fantastic and exactly what you<br>should be doing as our top PhD students<br>before people leave we will need the<br>contestants to stay and the judges to<br>stay for some photographs and we're as<br>well but at this point I'll ask where do<br>we come back and do our closing cut Ikea<br>would it be awesome<br>tattoo</p></main><footer
