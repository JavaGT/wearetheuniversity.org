greetings to everyone who<br>has joined us here this evening to this<br>the third panel in the university of<br>otago's winter symposium series<br>my name is hugh campbell and i'll be<br>your host tonight<br>first up i'd like to send a big thank<br>you to all of you for joining us and<br>participating in this event we are<br>hugely gratified by how many people have<br>tuned in to join us this evening<br>thank you also to this panel of<br>university of otago academics for<br>agreeing to spend an evening with us<br>here in the council chamber of the<br>university<br>usually when we enter this particular<br>room we are about to debate some<br>detailed minutiae about the processes<br>and procedures of the university which<br>in their own way are quite important<br>tonight we sit in the council chamber to<br>talk about some of the undeniably most<br>important challenges we are facing as a<br>planet<br>thank you for agreeing to join us<br>and thank you to all the other academics<br>who have helped shape the panel tonight<br>particularly alex mcmillan who has been<br>a vital contributor to the discussions<br>that have shaped tonight's event<br>i also want to say a big thank you to<br>the university staff who have been<br>working hard under crazy pandemic<br>conditions to get us assembled and ready<br>to go tonight<br>and i want to acknowledge and thank<br>everyone who has shared the pandemic<br>experience with the university and its<br>staff<br>whether it's our families our treaty<br>partners and the local roonaka the wider<br>community of who've turned to the<br>university for advice and guidance from<br>some of our experts on public health<br>with just the great mass of other people<br>who have helped us as university staff<br>to keep the show on the road and to keep<br>reflecting on what this pandemic means<br>for the future in our tower new zealand<br>so thank you all and welcome all<br>tenacious<br>the topic of tonight's panel is very<br>familiar and i'll open with a couple of<br>observations<br>first the one key quality of this<br>pandemic is that no one has been able to<br>escape it in some ways shape or form<br>i've heard it described in many quarters<br>as a black swan event<br>an event that is disruptive and shocking<br>because it is comparatively rare<br>and clear we really weren't prepared for<br>it<br>however for those using th that language<br>i respectfully disagree<br>this is generally considered to be the<br>sixth pandemic in the 21st century with<br>at least two of them including swine flu<br>and avian flu being definitively traced<br>to intensive farming practices<br>some to climate change and another bunch<br>to habitat destruction to make room for<br>resource extraction farming and urban<br>development that has squeezed wild<br>ecosystems into tighter and tighter<br>spaces and made zoonotic transfer of<br>pathogens from animals to humans all the<br>more likely<br>when it comes to understanding the<br>nature and scope of what we're<br>experiencing i don't think it's a black<br>swan event rather a black elephant event<br>it's the elephant in the room something<br>that was always likely to happen someday<br>it was just slightly unknown as to when<br>that day would come<br>yet given six prior pandemic events in<br>the last 22 years alone we can now see<br>that in hindsight<br>we were lucky to dodge a lot of previous<br>bullets and it was inevitable the<br>elephant in the room a virus that<br>transmitted rapidly had serious effects<br>and was hard to contain would eventually<br>happen<br>my second initial observation is<br>embedded in the first<br>our 21st century pandemics have been<br>caused in great part because of<br>environmental pressures<br>each of the previous ones was recognized<br>as such but luck combined with some<br>reasonable public health responses meant<br>that up until now we could keep running<br>just a few steps ahead of the<br>consequences of our environmental<br>actions<br>this one is different<br>consequently i see this pandemic as<br>revealing a lot about the state of the<br>world it has been a<br>profound event for our understanding of<br>public health<br>the subject of our previous panel and it<br>has also revealed the deep fractures and<br>socio-economic inequalities that might<br>have been previously less visible in our<br>tower new<br>which is the subject of our next panel<br>but it's also revealed some startling<br>things about our environmental footprint<br>our resource and energy use our<br>consumption patterns and the fragility<br>of a whole lot of underlying systems<br>like agriculture food and transport<br>here to tease these issues out in much<br>more detail are three wonderful<br>panelists i'm delighted to welcome along<br>associate professor michael jack the<br>co-director of the otago energy research<br>center<br>professor craig bunt who is our brand<br>new professor of agricultural innovation<br>and associate professor lisa mcneil from<br>our department of marketing<br>all have a particular interest in an<br>aspect of the environmental impacts<br>of our everyday activities from energy<br>use to food to retail purchasing and<br>each has been thinking a great deal not<br>only about how the pandemic changed<br>these things but also whether these<br>changes are permanent or temporary and<br>whether they signal key pathways forward<br>to sustainable transitions in the face<br>of other existential crises like climate<br>change<br>first up michael who is in our<br>department of physics and is a leading<br>thinker and researcher on sustainable<br>energy transitions he has a particular<br>interest in what kind of energy systems<br>we will need to survive the 21st century<br>particularly the challenge of<br>transitioning away from an energy system<br>based on fossil fuels michael over to<br>you<br>thank you thank you<br>um so<br>i guess the some of us who have been<br>thinking about climate change and energy<br>use for a long time<br>um we see every year<br>fossil fuels increasing year on year<br>and you know sometimes it feels like<br>we're on the titanic and we're heading<br>for an iceberg and there's no way to<br>turn the ship<br>but the great thing about<br>covert<br>from an energy perspective was that it<br>showed us<br>that we're able to<br>act collectively and make very large<br>very rapid changes to energy use and<br>greenhouse gas emissions<br>um so i just want to give you some<br>statistics just to show you the size of<br>of the change that that we were able to<br>bring about or that occurred because of<br>this the covert type lockdowns<br>so the international energy agency<br>reported there was that there was a nine<br>percent drop in oil demand in 2020<br>okay this included around 16<br>drop in the in quarter 2 of 2020 jet<br>fuel in particular dropped<br>41<br>with passenger air traffic um<br>66 below<br>2019 levels<br>um in new zealand aviation fuels for for<br>international travel dropped by 80 in<br>the june quarter<br>and domestic aviation fuels by 60 and<br>petrol by 30<br>so these are all really big numbers and<br>kind of to put this in perspective um<br>following the 1979 oil crisis energy<br>used for international travel um only<br>fell by 19<br>okay so these are the sort of<br>um<br>uh<br>very large changes very significant um<br>changes that we need to see if we're if<br>we're going to reduce greenhouse gas<br>reduction so<br>in a way it showed us you know what we<br>could do if we acted collectively and i<br>think related to this um covert also<br>showed us that um<br>the usual way of doing things is not the<br>only option and i think that that was<br>really important and we'll probably hear<br>it in the other talks as well<br>um and you know one trend is this this<br>idea of working from home rather than<br>having to commute to work for example<br>just as an example<br>um the second thing i think covert<br>taught us<br>was the value of detailed<br>real-time data for making important<br>decisions<br>so there was this amazing level of data<br>you could get access to<br>around how covert was progressing in<br>countries right across the world so you<br>could see<br>um the the positive cases that were<br>occurring in in each country the<br>immunization rates<br>hospitalizations and even sort of down<br>to the percentage of different strains<br>that were occurring<br>and um i reflected on this um well so so<br>this this translated into real concrete<br>actions um shutting the border<br>lockdowns and<br>in just one part of the country sort of<br>detailed actions the way we that we<br>could use this data for<br>and um i guess i reflected on on<br>this access to data and kind of the the<br>difficulties we actually have um<br>accessing data related to energy use and<br>greenhouse gas emissions in in contrast<br>to this<br>and you know i just want to give you one<br>example of this from my field um so new<br>zealand has one of the highest<br>implementations of smart meter data in<br>the world and<br>um access to this data if we if we<br>anonymized it<br>could provide detailed insights into how<br>new zealand does use electricity<br>um<br>and this could be used for a whole<br>variety of things<br>from new business models for sharing<br>solar pv between your neighbor what's<br>going to happen if everyone<br>started charging their electric vehicle<br>at the same time how we might be able to<br>be more flexible<br>in our demand to match a variable<br>renewables<br>so many researchers such as myself are<br>frustrated by the kind of<br>lack of data that is crucial to to<br>modeling that that future transition<br>um so i think i'll stop there because is<br>that<br>yeah that's fascinating i mean i think<br>um<br>yes thank you michael and the question<br>that comes to my mind is<br>uh clearly there was a massive change in<br>terms of our uh our place of work a lot<br>of us began working from home so<br>can you see in the data the extent to<br>which working from home may have shifted<br>the needle in terms of our overall<br>energy profile so so that i guess the<br>the really extreme<br>um<br>dramatic shift was in was in transport<br>so aviation and also um transport fuels<br>working from home did change um<br>electricity demand so<br>so i just have some numbers from new<br>zealand for example um commercial demand<br>for electricity dropped<br>four point four percent on residential<br>demand by um two point three percent um<br>these changes were um kind of outside<br>the range of changes you might see in<br>the last five years but they are still<br>kind of quite small compared to<br>transport that's interesting yes<br>certainly centered transport there all<br>right many follow-up questions to come<br>but of course people will be watching<br>online will know you can start to send<br>those questions and then we'll come back<br>too<br>uh we'll come back to michael um once uh<br>all three of our panelists have had a<br>chance to speak<br>so next i want to invite craig bunn to<br>join the conversation craig is the new<br>professor of agricultural innovation and<br>is spearheading some really exciting<br>developments at the university of otago<br>on how to<br>revision our future agricultural systems<br>drawing on science drawing mataranga<br>on the ground observations about what a<br>future food and farming system uh might<br>need to look like so tanaka craig and<br>over to you<br>thank you<br>you'd think this long into a pandemic<br>i'd be used to talking into a camera<br>that one thank you<br>and i'll look at my notes i'm a big<br>believer in open book um assessments and<br>presentations<br>so i'll talk a little bit about<br>emissions and<br>and transport as well in the agri sector<br>um emissions across the country and<br>different sectors and different<br>industries and our daily lives have<br>dropped during the pandemic and they're<br>starting to come back up again as we go<br>back to whatever the new normal is going<br>to be move towards the new normal<br>and agricultural emissions did drop a<br>little bit during the pandemic and<br>they're starting to come up again<br>but that shouldn't be seen as an<br>opportunity there to identify how that<br>happened and that might lead us to other<br>ways of reducing emissions in the<br>agricultural sector it was probably down<br>to transport um<br>what was moved around what was was<br>absolutely what was necessary to move<br>around particularly during lockdowns<br>which meant<br>some other things were simply put off<br>until later and so yes there were<br>emission reductions but we probably<br>won't see that have a long term<br>impact or change in practices<br>we've all heard a lot about how the<br>export agri market has has boomed<br>and the latest data is pointing to just<br>over 50 billion<br>for the last year<br>we're a nation that's very very good at<br>exporting food and and we hear a lot<br>these days 5 million feeding feeding 50<br>million<br>and this boom in export has has occurred<br>with the pandemic<br>with with war in europe<br>inflation<br>and so um it's a little surprising that<br>that boom is probably going to be around<br>for the next two to three years at about<br>many of the disruptions where we observe<br>encountered during the and have<br>encountered during the pandemic<br>not to be expected there was pressure<br>put on labor there's pressure put on on<br>materials<br>um<br>they've always been there the the form<br>was perhaps just changed by the pandemic<br>it's always been a challenge to get<br>people to work in the agri sector<br>what we saw<br>during the pandemic was a perhaps noble<br>reliance on cheap labor coming into the<br>country couldn't come into the country<br>there was a lot of<br>concern about finding enough people to<br>work in the agri sector<br>i personally<br>liked hearing the stories about how<br>wages were having to go up<br>i<br>liked that we could see<br>much of the country moving away from a<br>low-wage economy so there's perhaps<br>lessons to be learned there um<br>let's let's not go back to everything<br>back to the old old normal<br>but we're a nation of wonderful food<br>exporters but i don't think we could say<br>the same about our food distribution<br>internally<br>while our agri essential workers were<br>going to work every day they were<br>ensuring our farms and our processes and<br>our producers of food were operating<br>we didn't necessarily have shortages of<br>food but we had<br>we're now seeing other impacts due to<br>covert and the disruption of supplies<br>around the world and the supply chains<br>we're seeing the disruption from europe<br>with war particularly around cereals<br>and so something like wheat which new<br>zealand has typically only grown half as<br>much as it needs and we import the other<br>half and now we're seeing challenges<br>there<br>and so starting to put a spotlight on<br>the internal food and security we have<br>and where before we might not have<br>thought about where our food was coming<br>from and perhaps naively thought it was<br>all grown here<br>so a lot of our cereals are imported<br>we're pretty good at growing and meeting<br>our vegetable needs but there are<br>exceptions<br>we import more more garlic than we um<br>grow ourselves for ourselves<br>we're not a big producer of nuts or<br>pulses and so we have a reliance on<br>importation of those and<br>i think we we're now starting to feel<br>the impact of what's going on out in the<br>wider world<br>something as simple as the price of<br>bread if that goes up does not mean the<br>farmer is making more we have a finite<br>amount of land we can grow wheat on and<br>so they can't just double wheat<br>production and make more money<br>what a farmer is making on on wheat<br>today is based on a contract they filled<br>last year as well yet they're paying<br>input prices today to grow that wheat so<br>they're getting squeezed perhaps you<br>could say on on both ends the cost of<br>what's going in to be able to produce<br>the wheat<br>and what they agreed they would sell it<br>for last year so it may be going up in<br>the supermarket but that doesn't mean<br>and now we're entering a phase where we<br>think coverts going out but more has<br>been piled onto the agri sector<br>uh climate change commission has brought<br>out its recent um comments around<br>emissions reductions uh hiewake ikanoa<br>the agri sector proposal for emissions<br>reduction has come out<br>the government's plans around emissions<br>reductions there's a lot to digest at<br>the moment and it's it's coming out<br>sometimes daily but certainly every few<br>weeks something new to look at<br>while also addressing the ongoing<br>impacts of the pandemic they're merging<br>issues with the war in europe and<br>and i just finished with now the agri<br>sector is saying<br>um what<br>what a mouth<br>could could we just have a break could<br>we just slow down and deal with what we<br>have to at the moment but but<br>the agri sector is something that has<br>always had at the forefront of its mind<br>the fear of a pandemic and it was always<br>foot and mouth and and we're now having<br>to look at the possibility of that while<br>still<br>trying to deal with what's happened over<br>the last three<br>years i mean do you think put mouth is<br>one of those black elephant events uh<br>what are the chances we get unscathed<br>for the next 50 years in new zealand i i<br>think if we thought we'd always keep it<br>out that's incredibly naive um it will<br>come here one day it is definitely a<br>black elephant heading this way that's<br>how we respond to it um<br>we'll we'll be telling um<br>there are things that have<br>been um<br>planned in advance<br>we at least have the advantage of<br>seeing what's happened in other<br>countries<br>well before so with the pandemic we had<br>months of warning<br>with foot and mouth in many situations<br>we've got years worth of warning we've<br>seen how other other countries have<br>responded to it and we can take those<br>lessons on yes it might be a uniquely<br>new zealand thing like that that we're<br>vastly better prepared for an<br>agricultural pandemic than the human<br>ones um and i'm wondering i mean<br>craig you really have painted a very<br>clear picture of the extraordinary<br>difference between new zealand as this<br>incredibly successful export platform<br>for agricultural products<br>the most export-oriented agricultural<br>producer in the world but those<br>fractures that began to open up<br>within our domestic food economy um so<br>really<br>do you have any suggestions as to what<br>you think mainstream agriculture in new<br>zealand or what agriculture in new<br>zealand could do to improve food<br>security<br>it needs to diversify local food for<br>local production um talk of diversity in<br>the agri sector was probably always<br>framed in terms of<br>producing another product for export<br>um<br>varying what you do on farm for export i<br>think we need a<br>allowed conversation around diversifying<br>what we produce locally<br>maybe as consumers changing our<br>expectations on what we want to find in<br>the supermarket<br>um but that there are things around the<br>the staples where we need to look at<br>ways that we can either grow more but<br>certainly waste less<br>something like bread is is<br>either the most or the second most<br>wasted product out there if we could<br>have that would make a big difference in<br>terms of what we produce locally to eat<br>and what we have to rely on for<br>importing<br>indeed well i suspect um<br>mentioning some of those topics may have<br>just sent the questioners flying to<br>their keyboards out there on online land<br>so in the meantime i very much like to<br>bring lisa mcneil into this conversation<br>lisa is a leading thinker in research on<br>consumer behavior with a particular<br>interest in sustainable consumption and<br>how we confront unsustainable practices<br>in a range of settings from fast fashion<br>well the pandemic is really interesting<br>from a consumer behaviour perspective<br>because it gives us an opportunity to<br>look at what have been quite rapid<br>shifts in terms of consumer lifestyle<br>changes<br>if we think about these shifts we can<br>roughly categorise them in four key<br>areas<br>and really all of these areas are<br>centered on this idea of perhaps<br>resetting behaviour in quite a<br>disruptive fashion<br>if we think about finance and spending<br>there's increased financial insecurity<br>or financial concern on the part of most<br>new zealand consumers and that's really<br>meant that people have started to think<br>about their priorities for spending<br>thinking carefully about what is<br>actually important to them<br>and really one of the effects of that<br>has been a focus on the benefit to local<br>suppliers local producers where<br>consumers are asking that challenging<br>question of where should my money go<br>should it actually stay within my local<br>community or should it be used to<br>support new zealand business and that's<br>been quite a positive outcome of this<br>disruptive state<br>in terms of e-commerce we have seen a<br>really rapid move towards more consumers<br>embracing e-commerce channels even<br>consumers that were previously resistant<br>to using these channels or in<br>marketplaces that were traditionally a<br>face-to-face marketplace<br>that hasn't necessarily been a good<br>thing<br>often when somebody's making that shift<br>to e-commerce they're not necessarily<br>weighing up what is the net cost of<br>getting that product to me versus me<br>going to the product in a store for<br>example<br>but there are some positives that we can<br>reflect on<br>what we really saw in terms of the move<br>to the e-commerce space was quite a<br>radical change radical disruption<br>and that was really needed i think to<br>change people's perceptions of what<br>actually needs to take place<br>face-to-face versus perhaps what doesn't<br>need to<br>we're all resistant to that kind of<br>change so sometimes force change such as<br>what we saw throughout the pandemic is<br>what's actually needed to get people to<br>reflect on how change might be good um a<br>really great example of this i think is<br>a movement that has endured in some<br>context for the provision of online<br>health services<br>if you take you know the example of<br>mental health and well-being counselling<br>services that can be provided online<br>what we're actually seeing in new<br>zealand is that these services are now<br>beginning to reach communities who<br>either couldn't or didn't want to access<br>these in a face-to-face setting<br>and the fact that we've seen that<br>benefit and realized that this is<br>actually a good thing for health<br>provision means that we can actually<br>build on that foundation and think about<br>what else we can do to reach communities<br>like that<br>in new zealand we've also seen a huge<br>growth in what we term as the homescape<br>economy so people really reflecting<br>again on what's valuable to them and<br>often that is the home the friends the<br>family the whanau everybody that they<br>welcome into their home and even the<br>wider community<br>what that means is that a lot of the<br>focus for that financial reset or<br>spending has been centered on the home<br>or on the local community people perhaps<br>might be thinking more about<br>tourism domestically or tourism in their<br>local area rather than international<br>tourism they might be thinking about<br>changing their perhaps food purchasing<br>habits to support local suppliers local<br>growers<br>it gives us a lot of opportunity to<br>develop on this from a sustainability<br>perspective<br>there's a lot of evidence out there if<br>you have a look at um you know what's<br>trending on instagram or youtube or<br>tiktok that people are really embracing<br>this whole sort of make from scratch or<br>repair or do things ourselves and this<br>is an opportunity for us to build upon<br>that<br>just the example of the growth of fake<br>aways as a result of the pandemic you<br>know making your<br>making your false takeaway at home from<br>scratch and enjoying doing it and<br>keeping on doing it<br>really sort of underpins this type of<br>thinking<br>we also saw a disruption to traditional<br>brand loyalty as a result of the<br>pandemic and and much of that again was<br>centered around that movement to<br>considering small local or niche<br>providers of the the goods and services<br>that we consume<br>and this really says that we've got huge<br>potential the potential to really start<br>to develop and grow and support the<br>markets that we might not have<br>anticipated as having great growth so a<br>good example might be<br>locally produced clothing things that we<br>can take back to the maker for repair or<br>we can take back to have remade when<br>they go out of style or fashion<br>this type of thing actually offers a lot<br>of opportunity for us to perhaps<br>reconfigure how we perceive<br>what we consume and what's valuable to<br>us in terms of what we consume<br>thank you<br>it's it's fascinating i think that<br>of all the topics here um<br>we're discussing here it's like<br>when i think back to lockdown i think of<br>going through that experience it's like<br>how it disrupted the retail sort of<br>relationship was the thing that sort of<br>hit you most that plus a lot more time<br>on a bike or going for walks<br>um always within the neighborhood<br>um so i'm wondering<br>i mean<br>that experience of suddenly only being<br>allowed access to a very limited kind of<br>set of set of goods only essential goods<br>we were able to purchase there for a<br>while did that have an impact as do you<br>think yeah that was a really interesting<br>period because obviously consumer<br>spending dropped quite dramatically in<br>certain categories um you know<br>ostensibly we could only buy<br>what was deemed essential and you know<br>those categories were a bit fuzzy around<br>the edges of what was really essential<br>but we were limited and so we spent less<br>but then when the markets opened up<br>again we saw that immediate spike you<br>know people were quite excited about<br>being able to consume again they were<br>lining up for takeaways for example<br>what's been interesting is while we did<br>have that spike and consumer spending<br>has actually recovered to a degree<br>what we're actually seeing is people<br>starting to be a little bit more<br>thoughtful about how they're spending<br>now and so perhaps there might have been<br>a bit of that frivolous spending<br>directly after the lockdowns when things<br>became more available but on the whole i<br>think the new zealand consumers become a<br>lot more conscious about where their<br>money is actually going and what's<br>actually important to them in terms of<br>that spending<br>interesting well thank you panelists for<br>those opening thoughts and and<br>yes really opened up a lot of<br>interesting areas and i suspect that's<br>um i was going to say triggered a<br>reaction but i can't use that word now i<br>suspect that some gender reaction out<br>there with people who are listening in<br>and we have quite a bit of time<br>available now to see<br>see what people want us to talk about<br>now what i'll say is that i think well<br>the pandemic is enormously broad and its<br>environmental impacts are enormously<br>broad so let's take on what we can<br>uh we'll do by cell or whole if we need<br>to but i think maybe some of the<br>questions we might just have to pass on<br>but let's have a go now<br>yes uh thank you out there in online<br>land because the first question you've<br>sent in uh is a doozy<br>uh so the first question is have our<br>leaders done enough to shape a more<br>sustainable society<br>well who wants to go first on that one<br>but michael well i could i could have a<br>go because i guess um<br>what was interesting about the<br>international discussion um after the<br>pandemic was really around<br>the economic stimulus packages and<br>um you know focusing those towards<br>mitigating climate change that was the<br>kind of rhetoric internationally so the<br>international energy agency for example<br>they said<br>make clean energy transitions um the<br>center of economic recovery plans um<br>and it's interesting sort of to see how<br>the new zealand government responded to<br>that so they had you know this<br>extraordinary<br>large recovery fund<br>around three billion of that went to the<br>energy industry<br>and um<br>there are there are people out there who<br>track where this sort of money goes um<br>and<br>they were categorizing it whether it<br>went to the fossil fuel industry or for<br>the clean um to clean energy<br>and for new zealand it was around about<br>45<br>to fossil fuels and 54 to clean energy<br>so from an international perspective<br>that was quite a dismal<br>um<br>breakdown with even australia putting<br>thirty percent into fossil fuels and<br>sixty into into um to clean energy so i<br>think<br>new zealand fell down i think a bit<br>definitely the gold medal for australia<br>on that one i'm afraid that's right um<br>now that is that is a little concerning<br>i mean certainly it's been a period of<br>time it's been so interesting<br>do you think green hydrogen is something<br>that's come to the fore<br>yeah well probably yes there are there<br>are i mean there are a bunch of things<br>that um that are that are new and and<br>part of the new discussion yeah<br>interesting<br>lisa do you have uh thoughts about how<br>our political leaders have proposed<br>look i think you know<br>have they done enough enough is an<br>interesting concept isn't it i would say<br>no they've never done enough but i think<br>that might always be the answer with a<br>problem as complex as sustainability<br>in terms of questioning leadership as<br>well we have to say okay where is that<br>leadership are we talking about you know<br>local leadership at<br>dunedin um in in the otago region or are<br>we talking about you know government<br>leadership um i think most of us<br>depending on the area that we work in<br>could come up with suggestions for<br>things that should be done and could be<br>done that haven't yet<br>yeah<br>craig i've got a few thoughts about<br>agriculture how do you feel like we've<br>uh<br>i think we have a number of leaders in<br>agriculture who definitely do not say<br>enough about sustainability<br>and<br>aren't leading in sustainability<br>that said we have other leaders<br>political<br>in the sector and elsewhere<br>that um perhaps oversimplify<br>we cut out synthetic nitrogen all our<br>problems will be solved and and that's<br>just<br>far too naive but it gets too much<br>traction as if that's a simple and easy<br>solution if we do that all we'll be fine<br>so we need leaders who<br>are able to present just how complex the<br>issues are<br>and also bring out<br>possible solutions and ones that aren't<br>just there to get a good sound bite or<br>an easy agreement<br>presenting the hard solutions is going<br>to require some very excellent<br>leadership yes<br>yes i agree i mean there are there is a<br>real dynamic in terms of<br>change on the land that there there seem<br>to be two speeds i mean at one cent in<br>one level you're talking about sort of<br>the sound bite kind of response which<br>isn't really helping us because there's<br>a very complex collision of things<br>happening in rural new zealand at the<br>moment with a pandemic along with a<br>whole lot of other environmental<br>dynamics as you mentioned in your<br>opening statement coming due<br>or being long overdue to be dealt with<br>around about now so it feels like a it<br>feels like a very high pressure moment<br>um<br>and<br>maybe the pandemic is uh<br>maybe the pandemic has taken it off the<br>radar screen to a certain extent but<br>it's very much there isn't it<br>across the sector um satisfaction and<br>then<br>thoughts on you know where the economy<br>is going the agri economy<br>level of exports it's<br>the lowest it's been in in a generation<br>and i think it's it's yeah that's down<br>to no one thing<br>it's dealing with all of this at once<br>and<br>yeah there's nobody who's trying to<br>to address as much as possible<br>everybody's focusing on their little bit<br>so somebody might be talking about um<br>carbon sequestration<br>as if that's the answer another is<br>talking about alternative fertilizers as<br>if that's the answer or we'll all go<br>vegan as um if that's the answer<br>none of these are<br>death nails to agriculture as some might<br>say<br>or others might say that such and such a<br>leader is trying to kill agriculture<br>i don't think that that's the case<br>agriculture has always changed and<br>adapted that's what humans do<br>um what<br>agriculture will be in the future it'd<br>be great to have a crystal ball you<br>would make a lot of money if you knew<br>that um something new will come about<br>and we have to hope that it isn't<br>chasing just the bottom line of<br>financial outcome<br>we need more conversations around triple<br>bottom lines of is it good for the<br>environment is it good for society<br>and those leaders<br>aren't necessarily there yet i don't<br>think<br>interesting i think possibly you and i<br>need to be careful not to speak<br>agriculture too much uh given the shared<br>interest we do have<br>uh academic freedom though but uh we do<br>not know i mean in terms of<br>it's not the only issue out there it's<br>just happening to be an incredibly big<br>one yes<br>now uh next um<br>extremely well targeted questioning from<br>um from the online world<br>question says we made many positive<br>changes during lockdowns<br>shopping locally cutting transport have<br>we missed opportunities to ingrain these<br>in society and i would probably add and<br>say do we have a sense of how<br>comparative we've done compared to other<br>countries<br>uh in terms of taking this opportunity<br>to ingrain different ways of doing<br>things<br>what's to go first on that one<br>you know short answer yes<br>you know to be blunt i think it was easy<br>for many to slip back into previous<br>habits in fact you know people sort of<br>relished the opportunity to go back to<br>normal and that really was something<br>that um was you know promoted perhaps in<br>the way that even organizations<br>talked about the the change after coming<br>out of lockdown etc<br>and there were a lot of opportunities<br>just thinking back to the previous<br>question where<br>we really could have done with stronger<br>leadership um in this area you know<br>really really good example in terms of<br>the way that we manage shopping in this<br>country and you know online purchasing<br>we had a pandemic situation where<br>organizations were nominated to provide<br>essential goods and they were able to do<br>so um to have them transported to the<br>consumer's homes<br>there was little to no um<br>concern really by<br>people who were allowing this sort of<br>change around the packaging that those<br>goods arrived in or you know the form of<br>transit used to get the goods there<br>there was little consideration of<br>whether if you were purchasing a central<br>good should they come first from a local<br>supplier as opposed to a supplier at the<br>other end of the country so i do think<br>we have missed opportunities and it is<br>easy we can all say that as consumers to<br>slide backwards a little bit in terms of<br>of good habits you know anyone who's<br>perhaps started a gym membership and has<br>lived backwards knows that it is easy to<br>do so i think perhaps we could do better<br>yes that's interesting i'm reminded of<br>an economist of yesteryear who said you<br>know you need to have your alternatives<br>in place ready for when the crisis comes<br>my feeling is that we probably<br>we arrived with um with a few gaps in<br>the in in the shelf labels alternatives<br>that we badly need uh when the crisis<br>comes or what we need to be moving<br>towards and perhaps that's what one of<br>the things that really got exposed now<br>do either of you two want to<br>take on that question or should we move<br>on to the next one i can see that uh<br>michael's looking at the screen and<br>going i like that one<br>so shall i read it out<br>okay so the next excellent question is<br>do you expect to see a rise in the<br>amount of trends sport use again or is<br>it suspected there may be a slow<br>increase as people get used to being<br>able to travel as they once did well<br>i've been interested to hear what you<br>say i've just come back from my first<br>overseas trip with mixed reviews<br>um so tell us<br>yeah i i um<br>this is one of those crystal ball things<br>um where<br>um<br>who knows what's going to happen i guess<br>i mean there does seem to be this<br>feeling that we don't need to travel as<br>much i mean i think i think<br>the<br>the being able to meet online has become<br>quite a normal<br>thing now<br>that we kind of<br>i guess feel<br>less<br>um you know less need to to be traveling<br>um<br>just to to sort of meet people and and<br>and have a meeting i guess um and so<br>yeah i imagine that is that is something<br>that we will sort of um bed in after the<br>after the um<br>after you know in longer term<br>um yes it's interesting isn't it i mean<br>i sense that this is one of those<br>spaces where<br>the more sustainable course of action<br>also turns out to be the most<br>economically efficient course of action<br>it just it's it's it was cultural<br>inertia that stops you going there it's<br>a bit like food waste isn't it in the<br>sense that food waste is one of those<br>things where people doing the right<br>thing for sustainability<br>suddenly end up saving a whole lot of<br>money on their food bill as well and i<br>saw this great aha moment we should have<br>been doing this ages ago i wonder<br>whether transport's the same<br>whether we really do need to as<br>academics whether we need to be<br>traveling overseas to the northern<br>hemisphere multiple times a year yeah i<br>think that cultural um inertia idea is<br>exactly<br>yeah<br>craig any thoughts in this area or shall<br>we<br>i'm just i'm observing in my personal<br>life i i hope<br>the increased use of public transport<br>sticks with some people um some people<br>if things so-called getting better<br>inflation drops petrol drops or whatever<br>might go back to the private car<br>um but i hope a significant portion<br>we're now using public transport stick<br>with it yes<br>thank you<br>right well um here we have a special<br>request for lisa from her fan base and<br>the public<br>um what has covert's effect been on<br>consumer packaging and waste is there a<br>tension between perceptions of<br>protecting public health from infection<br>and effects on environmental health you<br>begin to go there you get a second<br>chance right<br>um<br>yes there is uh attention in that area<br>particularly<br>supermarkets as an example have<br>mentioned a swing where consumers who<br>previously were happy to buy products<br>unbagged unpackaged etc fruit and<br>vegetables<br>through the pandemic have moved back to<br>expecting things to be wrapped in<br>plastic there's been a rise again in<br>sales of products like glad wrap as an<br>example where there had been a slight<br>decline in those markets we're seeing a<br>lot more<br>sales in the category of cleaning<br>products<br>things that may not be necessary but<br>certainly make people feel<br>safer<br>you know chemical based products<br>products packaged in plastic so this<br>certainly has been a sort of a knock-on<br>effect of people's fear about covert and<br>fear about<br>illness and what they're actually doing<br>for the environment<br>yes yes that's that feels like a very<br>particular um<br>uh a very particular tension a<br>particular<br>attention is very relevant of this<br>particular moment in the nature of a<br>crisis to reveal those particular<br>contradictions doesn't it the problem is<br>though when you have attention like that<br>it brings about the opportunity for that<br>behavior to embed again and so we lose<br>all that positive stuff and you know we<br>start sliding back into saying it's<br>normal to wrap our products and layers<br>and layers of plastic<br>yes absolutely<br>right and<br>now uh<br>craig supporters out there in online<br>land uh have asked this question<br>but craig you mentioned the need to<br>shift to local production of food how<br>might this shift be encouraged<br>if we think of um<br>something like<br>oat milk<br>most of it is made overseas<br>a lot of it um until recently if it was<br>made from new zealand oats was still<br>made overseas<br>so oatmeal is a good example of<br>something that has needed<br>our local<br>production ability to do that<br>so there are brands here now that use<br>new zealand notes and process it here<br>and and so there's local production<br>we're seeing um<br>uh likely that there will be a<br>production facility set up in southland<br>so<br>we should see a move towards something<br>like oat milk being grown and made here<br>so i think we need to see see more of<br>that<br>there are some other<br>interesting unique<br>quirks and blocks we now are able to<br>grow hemp for<br>seed for oil<br>and for the protein from it to put into<br>food or hemp for fiber<br>but we can't use any of the waste<br>material from that industry for as a as<br>a stock feed<br>so one leaf off<br>a hemp plant is a violation of the<br>misuse of drugs act<br>so<br>where we could be growing something that<br>is disease tolerant drought tolerant<br>produces food and fiber and is a great<br>product for us<br>none of that can be used as a stock feed<br>as i say an alternative to pk palm<br>kernel expeller because we're this weird<br>little line in the misuse of drugs act<br>so we need some of those barriers to be<br>removed that sounds interesting i mean i<br>think<br>do you think there's a sense in which<br>there's a whole raft of food regulation<br>which is basically designed to<br>to address the large actors and the<br>large players in the food system it just<br>becomes very very hard for small players<br>to enter<br>into local food production yeah i think<br>there's some of that the hemp one's a<br>unique real quirky one um<br>but it's also<br>new zealand<br>is a small country or a small population<br>in a large country<br>um<br>we simply don't have<br>the capacity for some things<br>not necessarily food related but say<br>rendering of offal from an abattoir<br>you can collect from that the bone and<br>meat meal and turn that into pet food we<br>we have a very good industry doing that<br>a lot of it's exported around the world<br>the tallow from that industry can be<br>turned into a biodiesel but we export<br>the tallow to singapore because we don't<br>have a production capacity here as well<br>because we could just never do it at<br>scale<br>so um we need to think carefully about<br>what we are producing and can we<br>actually handle it locally at scale to<br>be able to utilize it here<br>interesting<br>yeah mike i think the next one's going<br>to be for you although we can all weigh<br>in because this is something that we've<br>all been thinking about lately so the<br>question is should mass terrorism<br>continue as it was before covert i<br>suspect that was a rhetorical question<br>from whichever wise soul from out there<br>sent it through to us<br>is it a rhetorical question like that<br>well yeah so i guess yeah i mean<br>emissions from aviation um are<br>i guess some of the most difficult um<br>uh greenhouse gas emissions to reduce<br>there's there's not a lot of options for<br>international travel um<br>and so<br>um within a country um there there are<br>more and more options where we're<br>looking at um small electric planes for<br>example that can that can do kind of<br>domestic travel but international travel<br>is one of those really<br>difficult areas that um<br>you know there could be aviation drop in<br>biofuels for example but i think before<br>any of that comes along<br>then the only real option is to reduce<br>the amount of international travel that<br>that<br>we do<br>as a way to reduce greenhouse gas<br>yes<br>you sounded very apologetic about this<br>but it's really one of the major issues<br>facing new zealand i mean we've talked a<br>lot about the massive agricultural<br>platform in new zealand but the the<br>importance of tourism as an economic<br>growth driver particularly in certain<br>places in the south island can't be<br>underestimated but i mean before the pen<br>we were having these discussions before<br>the pandemic happened we were talking<br>about you know there had already been<br>discussions underway what does the<br>future of queenstown look like if<br>there's a 90 reduction in international<br>air travel as probably they will need to<br>be to cope with climate change and we<br>did have an experiment with all<br>travelling locally and a lot of us loved<br>it<br>um so yes thank you for that question<br>um<br>so<br>i suspect uh whilst this is addressed to<br>all panelists it's again your fan base<br>is out there lisa could the panelists<br>tell us their thoughts on recycling and<br>rescuing of food and clothing are there<br>opportunities to reduce waste and to<br>make an enticing thing to do rather than<br>as a concept only for those experiencing<br>low income or poverty take it away lisa<br>well i think maybe if i address a family<br>member<br>maybe if i address the clothing question<br>and perhaps um you know somebody else<br>might like to think about the food<br>question<br>in terms of clothing<br>traditional clothing production has has<br>operated on this take make waste cycle<br>and and we've all been conditioned as<br>consumers to accept that as the only<br>option<br>we do have opportunities to change the<br>way people actually see that cycle we<br>have opportunities to actually have<br>people really think about what is the<br>actual life cycle of a garment and what<br>is my responsibility in regard to that<br>life cycle and that means changing what<br>you buy thinking really carefully about<br>how long you're going to use it or have<br>it for<br>thinking carefully about how you launder<br>the things that you have thinking<br>carefully about either the repair skills<br>that you yourself have or have access to<br>or what you're prepared to do to repair<br>to remake to extend the life but also<br>from a manufacturing perspective putting<br>pressure on<br>the people that are doing the take make<br>and the waste to actually take<br>responsibility at the end point as well<br>for what they're actually putting out<br>into<br>the consumer world<br>we as consumers have to change our<br>mindset around this concept of fashion<br>to really buy into that but i think<br>now is a great opportunity to actually<br>do that i think we're probably at quite<br>a freeing moment in that context<br>yeah interesting um there's kind of a<br>generational shift in a way isn't there<br>because i mean like my daughters<br>they only buy recycled<br>clothing yeah absolutely and you know if<br>we can take that where they think that<br>that is actually what's important and<br>valuable to them in regards to fashion<br>and get everyone to buy into it it would<br>be really helpful i frankly think it's<br>been under<br>underused as a marketing strategy for<br>the benefits of coming to the university<br>of otago as a student is that you cannot<br>survive without becoming extremely<br>reliant on the local lab shops<br>particularly as winter approaches<br>excellent um<br>so<br>the next question is a<br>this is a challenging one i suspect a<br>few assumptions builds into it<br>so i'll just give you the question given<br>escalating oil prices will be the new<br>normal<br>and the fact that renewable energy will<br>not be able to match our current level<br>of energy consumption in new zealand you<br>can address that<br>if you want seriously addressing how we<br>meet local and regional needs across all<br>industries particularly the basics food<br>clothing building materials to how<br>things more manufacturing accenture are<br>we going to be able to do it so i<br>suspect michael that's very much pitched<br>at you which is<br>are we on track to actually be able to<br>have<br>um renewable energy production that will<br>match the current trajectory of<br>consumption or are we going to have to<br>downscale<br>demand as well as changing our supply<br>yeah so i think there are two things<br>there i think<br>um<br>the kind of<br>transition that we need to undergo is<br>both<br>and<br>increasing energy efficiency which means<br>that we're we're kind of getting more<br>for how much energy we use<br>and then on top of that<br>renewable energy<br>and<br>i i really like the example of electric<br>vehicles here because<br>if you move from a internal combustion<br>engine to an electric vehicle you're<br>going from something that's around 30<br>efficient if you're lucky<br>more like 17 probably once you take into<br>the account the the time you spent at<br>lights or or whatever<br>um to to something that is much much<br>more efficient so an electric um<br>vehicle can be<br>um you know it can use a fifth of the<br>energy that a that a internal combustion<br>engine uses and so we're not we're<br>talking about going from um you know<br>five barrels of oil to the equivalent um<br>one<br>barrel of electricity so so you know<br>that efficiency gain is is coming<br>with sort of new technology as well as<br>the fact that now our<br>our energy is going to come from<br>renewable sources so that's the way we<br>can do it<br>it's those two things in combination the<br>energy efficiency plus<br>renewable energy<br>thank you for that um<br>craig<br>a question for you do we have some<br>innovators in agriculture demonstrating<br>the way forward for a resilient diverse<br>food production system that addresses<br>local and regional hunger and what role<br>is mataranga maori playing in that<br>innovation<br>was that also a member of your family<br>that's in vienna<br>um<br>i would roll both questions into to<br>to<br>very strong yes<br>i wish um the media when talking about<br>agriculture and if so if it's talking<br>about the exports<br>would just go to ewe agribusiness<br>and and not make them the<br>and ue agree businesses doing better<br>that that should be a focus because we<br>can learn so much more from that how<br>they operate how they're<br>multi-generational how far forward they<br>are looking<br>um<br>and and<br>the the<br>products they're looking at<br>what they're looking at they what they<br>can tap into in their local runaka where<br>we're<br>something that they have have<br>you know 400 years of knowledge<br>and and<br>how that could be<br>the next the next wonder product um<br>we've we've i i was so happy to see a um<br>an announcement some weeks ago of a<br>project to look at developing some<br>native plants into a coffee<br>we have species here that are the same<br>family as coffee<br>that's how we should be looking at the<br>potential impact on on our weekly coffee<br>and how more expensive it's going to be<br>to import it<br>we may actually be<br>sitting on something here that we we can<br>grow and tap into<br>um so there there has<br>always been that<br>scenario of people tap into the amazon<br>for the biodiversity that's there<br>we have it here we have knowledge here<br>about what is there at our doorstep but<br>it's always a story that is a oh and by<br>the way it should be the leading story<br>yeah interesting i i can't help but<br>respond and say<br>you know i think yes absolutely to all<br>that and i think<br>um<br>it's really through a series of<br>particular historical moments and in<br>particular dynamics around colonization<br>and where britain's food needs were at<br>the time we were columnists<br>that we ended up with this incredible<br>dominance of pastoral farming and<br>animal-based agriculture i mean how much<br>do you think the future basically looks<br>like um<br>a a<br>slightly less<br>uh focus on animals and more on plants<br>and resource marine resources definitely<br>we we could all do with less red meat on<br>our plate if we have red meat on our<br>plate<br>we should be looking at a lot more<br>plants and varied plants in our diet we<br>know we could grow them here but we're<br>very good at monocultures beard our<br>pasture beard our vineyards better<br>pine plantations so we need to move away<br>from that<br>um<br>we haven't had seaweed in our diet<br>until very recently in terms of the wrap<br>around<br>um<br>our sushi that there's a lot more<br>seaweed we we could have in that art and<br>we should<br>we're going to have to learn how to be<br>able to harvest that sustainably to not<br>have impact or rather than harvesting it<br>from<br>the natural environment so to speak<br>learn learn how to grow it as an<br>agricultural crop but also in waterways<br>it's going to be challenging because<br>we're already seeing um issues in terms<br>of say salmon farming getting too warm<br>in the mulberry sounds they have to move<br>out to<br>talk straight but what happens if cook<br>straight becomes too warm if they have<br>to move south um<br>then<br>who actually is able to do that and that<br>will that will become a very big<br>challenge i think yeah yeah thank you<br>for that<br>and um<br>i think probably as uh we're heading<br>towards the end uh we need we need to<br>confront a final question and a chance<br>for the panel to think about this<br>one final question<br>so<br>in light of all that we've discussed<br>tonight and and i think that<br>um i've really appreciated hearing you<br>do a deep dive into your areas of<br>draw reflections on that<br>but for someone listening out there if<br>from your area what you had to do one<br>thing what was the one what well<br>not the only thing but what would be the<br>first or the main thing you'd think<br>about in terms of shifting the levers of<br>change so lisa do you want to go first<br>sure<br>for me<br>i think that the one thing everybody<br>could do is really make a commitment to<br>themselves<br>to consume<br>whatever they consume more consciously<br>to think before they choose think before<br>they buy think before they use think<br>think of it nice and succinct that was<br>yes that was relevant to us<br>i have to give a very similar answer<br>um if it's something like a wool item of<br>clothing<br>um don't buy that because<br>you're going to feel good because if it<br>goes into a landfill of rots<br>wool is an amazing complex fibre<br>that should be seen as something more<br>than can rot it's already locked carbon<br>in why why throw it away we need to move<br>away from that the description used for<br>the fashion take make weights make waste<br>no wall should not make you feel good<br>about that um so yeah buy less waste<br>less<br>would it be the same about food waste<br>yes definitely um<br>part of its education and understanding<br>what we don't need to throw away but<br>also identifying where you can still<br>make use of that<br>yes thank you<br>michael<br>um yeah so i guess i i think the<br>probably the biggest<br>um<br>i'm worried about what you're going to<br>say as an academic very worried about<br>the same thing<br>yeah you should be um so so the thing i<br>think you could probably do<br>that would have the most influences is<br>is take you just halve your<br>international travel so instead of<br>taking two trips a year or however many<br>trips a year you take internationally<br>just take one<br>or one every two years or um uh just<br>reduce it to about a half of what you're<br>doing at the moment<br>and i think that would have a quite an<br>impact on on your you know straight away<br>on on your greenhouse gas emissions
