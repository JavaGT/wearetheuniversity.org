everyone and welcome to this<br>wonderful celebration of promotion to<br>Professor of Rebecca Campbell our<br>inaugural prophecy stal lecture my name<br>is Richard Blakey I'm Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor research and Enterprise here<br>at the University of atago it's my<br>pleasure and privilege to welcome you<br>here tonight and set the scene for the<br>event that we have before<br>us um I bring apologies from the vice<br>Chancellor Professor Murdoch who is very<br>very sorry he can't be with with us but<br>um also as we're welcoming guests online<br>know that Professor Murdoch uh will take<br>the opportunity if he can uh should this<br>be recorded to to catch up with the<br>proceedings because this is is a very<br>important time for our academic<br>leadership at the University not only to<br>celebrate the success of our most<br>successful uh academic staff and<br>reaching that Pinnacle promotion of<br>Professor but also just to have time<br>where we can uncouple from the other<br>things that we have in our lives uh and<br>actually just sit back and enjoy and<br>reflect on the wonderful work that our<br>leading uh academic staff can engage in<br>so it is a celebration of achievement<br>and um for that uh congratulations<br>Rebecca on that achievement it's also a<br>time to celebrate with our uh academic<br>community so welcome to colleagues<br>members of the theen and wider public so<br>welcome to members of the public both<br>here and I understand as far away as<br>California uh for your father and<br>stepmom Jim and Deborah as far away as<br>the UK for your sister Liz um but also<br>acknowledging your fine hour here uh<br>your uh mom Karen who I understand is<br>here um your husband Andrew uh kids<br>Charlotte and Eli and some in-laws uh<br>Jane and Christine and others who might<br>be here supporting you welcome on behalf<br>of the University it's our pleasure to<br>host you here on this beautiful denan<br>evening so to those in California it is<br>um it is 50° here um Fahrenheit uh and<br>uh we have a liquid Sunshine that is in<br>abundance today so we are we are<br>um I'm going to hand over to Professor<br>gimel to give um a formal introduction<br>to you for the for the um lecture but to<br>set the scene uh promotion to the<br>professor at the University of Tigo is a<br>big deal and we put on our gowns to<br>celebrate uh we undertake a very<br>rigorous process to assess people who<br>wish to be considered for that promotion<br>uh including the use of international<br>referees to Benchmark performance<br>against other leading universities and<br>the CR criteria are pretty simple but<br>really really hard to achieve that we<br>have three core areas of University<br>activity for academic staff of teaching<br>research and service service both the UN<br>the university and our wider academic<br>and non-academic communities and our<br>academic staff members must achieve a<br>very high and sustained level of<br>achievement in in at least two of those<br>areas to Warrant promotion and in having<br>a a look at Rebecca's CV I can see that<br>level of achievement is exceptionally<br>high in all three Rebecca is an<br>outstanding and very successful<br>researcher um don't I will mention this<br>we don't we don't just use U money as a<br>measure of success but bringing in more<br>than $15 million of extra mural funding<br>and leading an HRC program those are<br>really really uh difficult and uh high<br>levels of<br>achievement uh she is internationally<br>recognized for that research she is a<br>very popular teacher and supervisor of<br>research students um highly sought after<br>having supervised or being a supervisor<br>for 9 phds 3 M's and more than 20 honors<br>students and her University Service um<br>and service to the discipline is very<br>very extensive and represented at the<br>highest level so um we're very pleased<br>and I'm very pleased to be here to to uh<br>to warmly congratulate you on behalf of<br>the university for your well-deserved<br>promotion Rebecca<br>uh and we'll hand over to Professor Neil<br>gimmel to give you a more formal in<br>introduction<br>noroo thank you very<br>no no my high my so it's my very great<br>pleasure to greet you and welcome you to<br>Professor Rebecca Campbell's and noral<br>professorial<br>lecture um Richard's already Illustrated<br>I think uh the depth of achievement that<br>Rebecca has uh and why this propor<br>professorial uh promotion was so richly<br>deserved um Rebecca is quite simply an<br>outstanding colleague she is an<br>accomplished teacher a fantastic<br>researcher a research mentor of the<br>highest caliber and actually an<br>exceptional academic contributor and<br>colleague so congratulations Rebecca<br>we're so very very proud of<br>you Rebecca uh started her academic<br>Journey uh some part further from here<br>where indeed the sunshine is not liquid<br>uh it is indeed Sunshine so she started<br>in Cal Poly and completed a BSC there uh<br>before moving on to the Oregon Health<br>and Science University or OSU for short<br>uh where she completed her PhD studies<br>and relatively record time I'd have to<br>say for the United States uh so again<br>always looking as somebody who was going<br>to progress and Achieve exceptionally<br>she came to New Zealand uh almost 20<br>years ago uh and commenced as a<br>postdoctoral fellow in the department of<br>physiology and she has stayed there ever<br>since and I think physiology is<br>extremely lucky to have you as an<br>academic uh contributor to that<br>department and we're very very proud of<br>you also in the school the only thing<br>you could have done better was to have<br>joined the Department of<br>anatomy bit of parochialism coming<br>through there<br>sorry um so following that post-doctoral<br>Fellowship uh Rebecca moved through as a<br>research fellow and then became a<br>lecturer in the department of physiology<br>ology in 2009 so in a very relatively<br>short period of time she established<br>herself as a leading academic<br>neuroendocrinology um Rebecca's<br>achievements as a researcher I'll go<br>through in a little bit of detail uh but<br>just to acknowledge that as well as<br>being an exceptional academic uh Rebecca<br>currently holds uh the role of deputy<br>director of the center for<br>neuroendocrinology and she's also the<br>deputy head of Department uh research<br>for physiology and sits on the Morris<br>Wilkins Center of research Excellence<br>leadership Forum so these are all<br>additional activities that distinguish<br>somebody as being not just a fantastic<br>teacher and researcher but also uh<br>somebody who we can rely on to undertake<br>uh challenging tasks at times previously<br>she's been the associate in research for<br>the school of biomedical sciences and I<br>remember working with Rebecca when she<br>started that role in was uh amazed at<br>how much energy and enthusiasm and drive<br>she brought to that role we're very<br>appreciative of your time that you spent<br>working on that to uh bring the school<br>uh<br>forward but it's really and I guess this<br>is I mean Richard has already<br>Illustrated that we are recognizing<br>three things when we promote Professor<br>but one of the things that really<br>distinguishes uh our professors often is<br>their research<br>achievements uh which are benchmarked<br>internationally as Richard has already<br>said and Rebecca's research actually<br>touches uh to me quite personally<br>because it works in an area that<br>interfaces between the brain and<br>reproductive systems and for those of<br>you who don't know me I have some<br>interest in<br>reproduction and really it's about<br>focusing on how androgens which are male<br>hormones impact the female brain<br>predominantly male hormones uh and how<br>that then impacts the development of<br>pathology of a disease called polycystic<br>ovary syndrome and polycystic ovy<br>syndrome uh probably affects many of<br>people who are listening online and also<br>some in the audience it's the most<br>common endocrine disorder amongst women<br>that can affect in some populations up<br>to one in five women uh of childbearing<br>age and it can be quite devastating in<br>terms of its um its<br>effects and despite its high prevalence<br>we know relatively little about uh its<br>cause and indeed we have relatively few<br>clues about its treatment but Rebecca is<br>leading the way in terms of developing<br>ways to better understand this and treat<br>this disorder her team has discovered<br>that Android and excess drives changes<br>in the female brain and that they are<br>associated with the development<br>maintenance of PCOS like<br>features and she has focused on novel<br>ways to prevent and reverse this<br>predominantly working with uh mine or<br>rodent<br>models um I could go on at length and<br>have been known to but I will uh draw it<br>short because I don't want to steal<br>Rebecca's Thunder she's going to give us<br>a wonderful IPL I'm sure and I'm going<br>to invite her to the stage to deliver<br>that address<br>here thank you so much um Deputy Vice<br>Chancellor Blakey and<br>my Dean uh Neil gel for that really kind<br>and generous introduction I'm kind of<br>Blown<br>Away um and to the rest of you taoto<br>taoto<br>tenoa Miana k<br>manena no konia AO Co L Campbell<br>tooa so for those um that aren't from<br>here that are streaming in I've given<br>you my Mii in Mai I've greeted you and I<br>have acknowledged the people of the land<br>and I've introduced<br>myself so thank you so much for um being<br>part of this those of you that have made<br>it out tonight on this really horrible<br>weather night thank you for for braving<br>the weather to be here means a great<br>deal to me and uh thank you also to<br>those that are streaming in um as<br>Richard kindly mentioned um my dad dad<br>my stepmom in the US my sister in the UK<br>and friends from several places in the<br>US it's great to have you guys here um<br>and I'm really excited to be able to<br>share with all of you my friends and my<br>family and uh my colleagues a little bit<br>about what I do um and the title of my<br>talk is um a little bit of a play on<br>words because as you'll see uh through<br>the work that I'm going to talk about a<br>lot of of my work involves harnessing<br>light H generally in the form of lasers<br>and microscopes to be able to visualize<br>these beautiful cells in the brain to be<br>able to better understand their<br>structure and uh infer more about their<br>function but I'm not just going to talk<br>to you about science uh the other goal<br>of my talk is really to honor and<br>acknowledge all of the amazing people<br>that have supported me on my career<br>journey and in my life uh this Marti<br>proverb asks what is the most important<br>thing in the world well let me tell you<br>hey tangata heang he Tanga it is people<br>it is people it is<br>people and in the spirit of<br>that I really want to dedicate this<br>lecture to my family uh both my family<br>of origin that raised me I'm really<br>excited to have my mom here tonight um<br>also the family that I've chosen and<br>inherited and the family that I'm<br>raising and also to those who are no<br>longer with us and I'll tell you a<br>little bit more about some of these<br>people as I<br>go so just like a good thesis or a good<br>research article starts with some<br>background I'm going to start with a<br>little bit of background about me tell<br>you a little bit about my research<br>journey and throw some science in as<br>well so I hail from the sunny Southern<br>California<br>coast um I've been a lover of the beach<br>and apparently Wonder Woman from a very<br>early<br>age and I was very fortunate to be born<br>into a family where I was loved and<br>supported and where learning was always<br>highly valued so these are my parents<br>this is uh my mom Karen who's able to be<br>here tonight uh my mom's always been my<br>greatest cheerleader and an amazing role<br>model for me uh this is a picture of her<br>in uh the Texas A&amp;M yearbook from where<br>uh she got her master's degree in<br>history she taught at the high school<br>and Junior College level and um yeah<br>it's just awesome to have you here Mom<br>and this is my dad Jim you can see him<br>here in his PhD regalia so my dad is a<br>retired organic chemistry<br>professor um he likes to tell people<br>though that he um teaches sex education<br>he said it's makes it more fun at<br>parties nobody really wants to talk to<br>an organic chemist apparently um from my<br>dad I've learned a lot about the value<br>of hard work and he's really modeled a<br>love of lifelong<br>learning um I'm also really grateful to<br>my wonderful stepmom Deborah here hello<br>to you guys in California and I've also<br>been lucky to be surrounded by some<br>fantastic siblings uh and step siblings<br>you guys are all amazing and I just want<br>to<br>particularly uh make a shout out to my<br>two older sisters you guys really paved<br>the way for me in life in general uh but<br>also in science and Academia so my<br>sister Elizabeth Libby um taught science<br>for many many years and is now a head of<br>school in the UK and my sister Pam is a<br>professor of<br>psychology um in<br>California but I didn't always want to<br>be a scientist even though I went to a<br>high school where um they had a very<br>good reputation for um a great science<br>program and I loved my uh biology<br>teacher Mr jundanian or Mr Jay as we<br>called him and he was very famous for<br>winning the local Science Olympiad and<br>even though I really loved uh science I<br>had nothing to do with winning these uh<br>competitions because I had many other<br>extracurricular activities and some of<br>you may not know that I uh captained our<br>very compet comptitive drill team for<br>many years so this is mostly what I was<br>I was doing in high school and I was<br>also having a wonderful time with this<br>crew of friends who really became my<br>lifelong friends this is us about 30<br>years ago and this is us just last<br>month but by the time I finished high<br>school I had figured out that I really<br>loved science and I like the idea of<br>helping people so I ended up moving a<br>few hours up north uh to become a Premed<br>major at calp San<br>lispo and the Beautiful Central Coast<br>and again this time is mostly punctuated<br>for me by the amazing people uh these<br>are my flatmates or housemates I suppose<br>as we call them in the US and these are<br>still my precious friends but there were<br>many things uh that happened during<br>these years at cowp which really<br>ultimately led me to where I am<br>today so the first of those things was<br>that um during my Premed program we were<br>encouraged to work in clinics or in<br>hospitals and I ended up working in an<br>Obstetrics and Gynecology office and<br>this is where I first learned about<br>polycystic ovary syndrome and the<br>devastating effect that it has on women<br>and um really learned to Value uh<br>Women's Health and how little we really<br>understand about it but I also learned<br>that being a physician was probably not<br>for me so that was the first thing that<br>happened the second thing that happened<br>was that I had the pleasure of<br>interacting with uh this inspiring woman<br>she was a young Scrappy academic who had<br>just left her postto at UCSF and come to<br>calply and she was so excited about her<br>teaching and research and I could see in<br>her uh potentially what I might be able<br>to become if I went down this research<br>and academic path and it's just reminded<br>me of the value of role models for all<br>of our students<br>the third thing that happened was that I<br>decided to spend a year abroad and I<br>ended up more by process of elimination<br>than anything else at Lincoln University<br>in Christ Church and two really<br>important things happened there so the<br>first is that I had a chance to do some<br>whole animal physiology and in<br>particular<br>neuroendocrinology with Gran Burell who<br>was very inspiring and also happened to<br>be Professor Greg Anderson's PhD<br>supervisor at the time uh so I got<br>really excited about the idea of being<br>able to test what's going on in the<br>brain and measure hormones in the<br>periphery the other really important<br>thing that happened was that I met the<br>love of my life and my future husband<br>Andrew so by the time I finished my<br>years at cowo I knew that I was probably<br>not going to medical school was probably<br>going to go to graduate school and check<br>out research and I was probably going to<br>spend a lot more time in New Zealand and<br>uh my family took it relatively<br>well<br>so being inspired by my time in the<br>clinic I decided that I wanted to do<br>research on the ovary and so that took<br>me to Oregon Health and Science<br>University up in beautiful Portland<br>Oregon you can see U Mount Hood here in<br>the<br>distance and although I intended to join<br>a lab that studied the ovary through the<br>course of my first year lab rotations I<br>had the opportunity to work in some labs<br>that were looking at the neuronal<br>control of the ovary and I decided that<br>perhaps I should be studying the organ<br>in the body that controls the ovaries<br>and so I ended up uh joining the<br>laboratory of Susan Smith who is a<br>formidable scientist and inspiring<br>Mentor uh she was the director of The<br>Institute that I worked at um and I'm<br>really um so thankful for all of her<br>support and I also had the opportunity<br>to work with Kevin Grove who was a lab<br>manager at the time um incredibly<br>supportive I knew nothing and he<br>essentially taught me everything I<br>know so um my project was about looking<br>at the circuits in the brain that<br>integrate signals about<br>metabolism with the circuits in the<br>brain that signal reproductive function<br>and specifically I was investigating how<br>negative energy balance uh is able to<br>suppress reproductive D<br>function so just to set the stage for uh<br>this concept give you the rationale so<br>we know that individuals that are either<br>um underweight or overweight will<br>frequently suffer from<br>infertility and lifestyle changes that<br>bring those individuals into a healthier<br>weight will move them into a place where<br>fertility is generally restored so we<br>know that energy balance and fertility<br>are tightly linked and we know that this<br>is actually happening in the<br>brain so here's a brain and I'm going to<br>gently introduce you to the circuits I<br>want to tell you about today so there's<br>an area at the base of the brain known<br>as the<br>hypothalamus and in this region of the<br>brain there are networks of neurons that<br>ultimately uh control the release of<br>hormones from the<br>brain that then go on to drive patterned<br>secretion of additional hormones from<br>the pituitary gland which go on to<br>regulate what happens at the<br>ovary and this includes things like<br>ovulation and also the production of<br>genetal steroid hormones like estrogens<br>and progesterone and androgens like<br>testosterone and these hormones have<br>important feedback effects at the level<br>of the brain through this neuronal<br>network that controls hormone<br>output but this network is not only<br>responding to steroid hormones from the<br>periphery it's also importantly uh<br>responding to other types of signals<br>that signal whether it's an appropriate<br>time for reproduction to occur so this<br>includes things like energy balance and<br>nutrition and stress and at the time um<br>that we were looking at this this was 25<br>years ago how this was actually<br>happening in the brain um was really<br>poorly understood we were just beginning<br>to understand it<br>and so I'm not going to go into any<br>great detail about the data that I<br>collected in my PhD I just wanted to<br>highlight this as a time in which I<br>learned how to use antibodies and<br>fluorescent markers and fancy<br>microscopes to be able to identify<br>specific cells in the brain and The<br>receptors that they express and the<br>interconnections between neurons uh that<br>are passing on information about things<br>like energy balance<br>so these are just some images that I<br>took with my phone out of my printed<br>thesis because I can't access the floppy<br>disc<br>anymore yeah I should have probably done<br>something about that earlier um but you<br>can see some of these beautiful cells<br>and all of these um connections from<br>other cells these are axons these long<br>um fibers that come off of neurons and<br>we looked at um where receptors were<br>expressed on these cells to identify a<br>little bit of the the um functional<br>anatomy of energy balance signals that<br>control reproductive function I was<br>pleased to have some of this work Grace<br>the cover of<br>endocrinology and I just wanted to show<br>you my summary diagram for my thesis<br>it's very complicated I won't walk you<br>through it uh but just to say that we<br>were able to set the stage for<br>understanding which neurons in the brain<br>are communicating to other neurons in<br>the brain and able to respond to these<br>signals about energy balance this is me<br>looking very happy after I've just um<br>defended my thesis publicly uh and yeah<br>again I'm really grateful to Susan and<br>Kevin for all of their support through<br>these<br>years and I can't leave this period of<br>my life without acknowledging um uh very<br>um wonderful people that were my mentors<br>and supporters and Friends through our<br>time in Portland<br>and so at the end of this uh of my PhD<br>or close to the end of my PhD um Andrew<br>had moved to the us and we were quite<br>happily settled there and we didn't<br>really intend to leave the us but I<br>received a newspaper clipping it was<br>actually a an article out of the<br>Southland times that had been sent from<br>Andrew's family talking about a<br>researcher in Cambridge who was moving<br>to otago to establish a research center<br>on<br>neuroendocrinology and I thought gosh<br>what a great opportunity to go and do<br>some research I'm really interested in<br>and also to be back near Andrew's family<br>for a little bit we thought we'd come<br>back for three years and then we'd go<br>back to the US and get real jobs we<br>didn't really think we were moving here<br>for Life uh but that was 20 years<br>ago and it's because it's so<br>good so um so this was Alan herbison who<br>was moving from Cambridge um and I was<br>really pleased to be able to join his<br>lab so this is the early lab you may<br>recognize some of these young fresh<br>faces and he established the center for<br>neuroc chronology and this is our our<br>newly minted group and I'm really<br>grateful for This research group of um<br>really collegial and collaborative<br>colleagues it's been an amazing group to<br>be a part of we do a lot of<br>baking uh and these are all the<br>individuals I think that had something<br>to do with the US I think we'd all<br>studied in the US and we were<br>celebrating the 4th of July<br>so um so these were some great years as<br>a post-doctoral fellow and a research<br>fellow in the herbison laboratory and<br>the projects that I worked on were<br>really um somewhat similar and a bit of<br>an extension of those things that i'<br>done as a PhD<br>student the focus was really uh though<br>not on energy balance but on these gal<br>steroid hormones and defining the<br>neuronal circuits through which they<br>were working to regulate reproductive<br>function in the brain um in addition we<br>were also interested in looking at these<br>neurons which are the final output<br>neurons of this large neuronal Network<br>that regulates reproductive function<br>these are known as the gonadotrope and<br>releasing hormone neurons or G&amp;R neurons<br>and I was interested in determining uh<br>how these neurons are poised to receive<br>and integrate all of the different<br>signals that they're receiving from<br>other cells to um Reg at their function<br>in the varied ways that they need to<br>behave over the life course of<br>reproductive<br>function and one of the really cool<br>Parts about uh the work that I was able<br>to do was that it involved um these new<br>transgenic models and tools that were<br>just coming online at the time so why do<br>we need transgenic tools what are these<br>uh well I'll give you a rationale for<br>why we need these so I like to tell my<br>students that the cortex and the typic<br>campus and the cerebellum are the salad<br>bar of the brain so they're full of um<br>cells that are all similar to one<br>another a nice neat little rows they're<br>easier to kind of go in and identify and<br>study they're not really that easy but<br>easier than the hypothalamus which is<br>really like the soup of the brain so the<br>hypothalamus is full of all different<br>types of neurons that are sitting right<br>next to one another and so it can be<br>really challenging to go in and study a<br>specific spefic cell type in the<br>brain and the gation neurons in<br>particular are quite challenging because<br>they're really scattered throughout this<br>soup of the<br>hypothalamus and so we've really needed<br>better tools to be able to Target and<br>study these neurons and what I want to<br>do is just walk you through one study in<br>my uh postdoctural years that took<br>advantage of some of these transgenic<br>tools and tell you about how that model<br>enabled us to learn a little bit more<br>about the central regulation of<br>fertility so that model is a relatively<br>simple model it's um takes advantage of<br>a gene in jellyfish uh that expresses a<br>green fluoresent<br>protein and uh alen herbison had<br>generated a mouse model in which that<br>protein is expressed exclusively in the<br>G&amp;R neurons so what that means is that<br>we can look at the brain and we can<br>actually visualize these neurons and<br>their scattered distribution through out<br>the brain and then we can do lots of<br>cool things we can actually patch on to<br>these cells with tiny glass micro<br>pipets and we can fill them with low<br>molecular weight dyes we can also record<br>their activity and pull out their<br>intracellular contents to study them um<br>but one of the projects that I was<br>involved in was in collaboration with<br>San in the<br>lab and we were filling these cells and<br>recognizing that the morphology of these<br>these neurons when we filled them with<br>these low molecular weight dyes was<br>quite different to what we had um<br>previously appreciated and it really<br>began to change the way that we think<br>about how these cells are regulated so<br>if you just look at this uh higher<br>magnification<br>cell you can see that when we fill these<br>all of a sudden we can appreciate all of<br>these new features so one thing I'll<br>point out are just all these tiny little<br>uh protrusions these are known as spine<br>and in most neurons these spines are<br>sites of synaptic input so this gave us<br>a way to measure the amount of input<br>that was coming to these cells and take<br>a look at the different types of inputs<br>that these cells were<br>receiving the other thing that we<br>noticed was that the input zone of these<br>cells which is known as the dendrite was<br>incredibly long much longer than we had<br>uh previously<br>appreciated and even at the very distal<br>ends of these dendrites these input<br>zones we were seeing all these spiny<br>protrusions suggesting that these cells<br>were receiving inputs at parts of the<br>neuron we had never actually even been<br>able to see<br>before and so several studies of this<br>nature allowed us to understand a little<br>bit more about how G&amp;R function how GNR<br>neurons function in the short medium and<br>long term and so if you just look at<br>these lines over here these different<br>different patterns of lines are<br>indicating the activity and the hormonal<br>output of these neurons on an hourly<br>basis so we see these pulses of<br>secretion on a daily basis so we see<br>changes in the output uh for example<br>over the female Ester cycle and also<br>over the lifespan so we see activity<br>elevated around birth and then again<br>with pubertal onset and so I won't go<br>into the details again but sever of<br>these studies helped us to appreciate<br>how genr neurons do this how they behave<br>so<br>differently so one of the studies um<br>involved looking at<br>um there we go yes uh looking at these<br>GNR neurons and how they were associated<br>with one another uh one of the big<br>questions we've had is how this<br>scattered population is synchronized and<br>can behave together as a unit to<br>generate these pulses of activity and by<br>looking at these GNR neurons and how<br>they relate to one another we were able<br>to posit hypotheses about how these um<br>neurons might be behaving together to<br>secrete these pulses which are required<br>for Reproductive function we also found<br>by looking at the shape or the<br>morphology of these neurons that there<br>were sometimes dramatic changes in the<br>shape of these cells at times when the<br>activity of these neurons was increased<br>so in the female cycle at the time of<br>ovul ovulation and also with pubertal<br>onset we see that the morphology of<br>these neurons is changing suggesting<br>that there are there's plasticity or<br>changes in the intervation to these<br>cells now I'm really proud about um<br>several of the studies that I was able<br>to do in the herbison lab um this<br>morphological work was also aligned with<br>some work we were doing with viruses to<br>map the circuits that regulate GnRH Nur<br>but by far the um experimental outcome<br>that I'm most proud of during<br>my my postto and my research fellow<br>years um are these guys so during these<br>years uh we had Charlotte and Elijah Eli<br>who are here in the audience um yeah<br>best experimental outcome ever still<br>collecting data it's kind of<br>longitudinal um but yeah they're<br>remarkable people and yeah you guys are<br>uh the best thing I ever<br>did um now having uh kids when you're<br>aspiring to be an academic is a little<br>bit challenging um but I had amazing<br>support both from the University of<br>atago and my department and my<br>supervisor uh but also at home um Andrew<br>is an amazing um father and partner and<br>they say it takes a village to raise a<br>family and so we uh have an amazing<br>Village so I'm really super grateful too<br>to my mom Karen and the wonderful<br>aunties to my children Jane Campbell and<br>Christine Donnelly who are also here I<br>honestly couldn't do what I've done over<br>the last um couple of decades without<br>your love and support so thank you very<br>much and I I just want to highlight here<br>I love this picture this is my mom<br>carrying a very collicky Charlotte while<br>I'm presenting at the society for<br>neuroscience conference so there was<br>village so fast forward a few years and<br>in 2009 I was thrilled to be appointed<br>uh as a lecturer in the department of<br>physiology which has been a wonderful<br>place to work and I'm very grateful for<br>my early lab uh these individuals really<br>established all of the work that we've<br>been able to do over the last several<br>years and I want to make a special shout<br>out to Mel Prescott who I think is in<br>the audience um so Mel has been with me<br>since the beginning she's uh an<br>exceptional lab manager and honestly I<br>don't think my lab would run without her<br>uh so thank you Mel for everything<br>you've done we all love you and you can<br>never<br>leave um so this is a slide from my 2009<br>job talk and so it gives you an idea of<br>some of the things that our lab was<br>focused on but I just want to spend the<br>rest of the time talking about this<br>project which was really aspirational at<br>the time which was to understand what's<br>happening in the brain in this common<br>endocrine disorder polycystic ovary<br>syndrome or<br>PCOS so uh what is<br>PCOS so a PCOS diagnosis involves um two<br>or three of these Cardinal features so<br>they include Androgen excess or elevated<br>uh maleik hormones or male typical<br>hormones like testosterone menstrual<br>irregularities and a polycystic<br>appearance of the ovary so it's quite a<br>heterogeneous disorder it's also<br>associated with several comorbidities so<br>it's associated with a metabolic<br>syndrome including obesity and insulin<br>resistance and women with PCOS are at a<br>higher risk for developing anxiety and<br>depression um some Cancers and also<br>cardiovascular<br>disease and it's also really common so<br>as Neil said um it's estimated that<br>probably more than one in 10 women in<br>their reproductive years will suffer<br>from PCOS and it's currently the most um<br>common cause of infertility associated<br>with<br>anovulation and Beyond just the the pain<br>and suffering of the women who are<br>coping with PCOS it has a huge um health<br>care cost so the healthare cost in the<br>USA alone is exorbitant and we don't<br>really know what the health care costs<br>are here in New<br>Zealand all of the treatment for PCOS is<br>symptom based and that's because we<br>understand so little about it and<br>there's currently no<br>cure so this was a space that I was<br>really interested in in getting into and<br>trying to get at what causes PCOS and<br>how we can reverse<br>it so why do we think the brain is<br>involved<br>well hopefully you're you've stayed with<br>me by now and and and this is a<br>comfortable concept that the brain and<br>the ovary have this two-way<br>communication so signals from the brain<br>are controlling what happens at the<br>ovary and the ovary has signals in the<br>form of hormones that signal back to the<br>brain to keep this balance in<br>homeostasis well we know in polycystic<br>OV syndrome that this um communication<br>is broken down so the brain appears to<br>be insensitive to the signals that are<br>coming from the ovary and because of<br>that you then have hyperactive signals<br>coming from the brain back to the ovary<br>and we know that this drives many of the<br>pathological features that we see at the<br>ovary in PCOS<br>patients so how do we know this how do<br>we know there's this communication<br>breakdown well we can measure evidence<br>of the hormones uh resulting from this<br>axis in the peripheral blood so we can<br>look at luteinizing hormone which you<br>can see here and we see that its rate of<br>secretion um and its level of secretion<br>is dramatically increased in patients<br>with PCOS compared to healthy<br>controls so this uh is reflecting<br>increased GN secretion from the<br>brain and we know that this disordered<br>pattern of hormones is driving many of<br>the downstream features<br>so this impairs ovulation it causes an<br>increase in Androgen production and<br>androgens are associated with all of<br>these overt and distressing symptoms of<br>PCOS which include excess hair growth<br>male pattern baldness and<br>acne what we also know about uh PCOS is<br>that it takes a lot higher gatal steroid<br>hormone levels of estrogen and<br>progesterone to slow down this<br>hyperactive secreet<br>and that tells us that the brain is<br>become insensitive to this steroid<br>hormone feedback that would ordinarily<br>slow down this<br>secretion so that really points to the<br>brain as a Central site for pathology<br>and PCOS and this is something that I<br>thought given what I'd learned in my PhD<br>and my postto that I could apply to this<br>problem now I'm most interested in women<br>and uh clinical PCOS but to study this<br>question in women currently is<br>impossible we just don't have the tools<br>to look at uh circuit level um um<br>problems in the human brain and so we're<br>dependent on animal models but animal<br>models have a couple of<br>advantages uh so the first is that the<br>hypothalamus that we're interested in is<br>highly conserved across M million<br>species so we can learn what's going on<br>in the hypothalamus of a mouse and we<br>can translate that back to the clinic<br>and secondly uh using these murine<br>models allows us to take advantage of<br>all of these transgenic tools uh that<br>allow us to begin to pick apart what's<br>level and before I tell you about the<br>work that we've done in this space I<br>think it's really important to just take<br>a moment and uh honor and thank those<br>that have come before me in this space<br>uh so these are all of the people that<br>have whose work um really set the stage<br>for us to do what we do so these two<br>clinicians described uh this hormone<br>output that suggests that the brain is<br>involved and all of these uh basic<br>researchers have begun to identify how<br>androgens are acting in the female brain<br>and I'm really proud at this point in my<br>career to call actually all of these<br>friends so the first thing we needed to<br>do in the lab was to establish a model<br>and establishing a model can be<br>difficult if you don't actually know<br>what causes a disease but we do know<br>that excess Androgen exposure early in<br>development is strongly linked with PCOS<br>development with puberty and that's<br>represented here by this red line so we<br>can take advantage of this knowledge and<br>we can model an that Express pcus<br>features by exposing them to elevated<br>androgens early in<br>development if we um expose pregnant<br>dams to high androgens late in gestation<br>we see that their female Offspring<br>develop many of these<br>features and so we've gone about<br>characterizing this model they have<br>Androgen excess they have modified<br>morphology of their ovaries and they are<br>acyclic so they have they don't have<br>normal Cycles and importantly this<br>increased hormone output uh from the<br>brain is also evident in this model so<br>obviously different scale but we see in<br>our preclinical model this hyperactive<br>secretion of<br>hormone so what I want to do is give you<br>the takeaway message first and then<br>using as few graphs as possible<br>hopefully provide you with some evidence<br>to support these<br>claims so what I'm going to tell you is<br>that prenatal Androgen excess programs<br>changes in the brain programs uh changes<br>in the wiring to these gen neurons and<br>in particular changes uh wiring coming<br>from Gaba neurons neurons that signal<br>with<br>Gaba I'll show you that if we activate<br>this circuit that we've identified we<br>can elicit a PCOS like phenotype<br>suggesting that the pathology in this<br>circuit is sufficient to drive PCOS and<br>I'll also show you that that these<br>circuit abnormalities are programmed<br>early likely associated with changes in<br>microa pruning I'll tell you what microa<br>are and uh that importantly this circuit<br>remains plastic and we can actually<br>reverse these changes with anti-androgen<br>treatment okay so Alicia Moore uh was my<br>first PhD student<br>um wonderful student she has her own<br>group um<br>in uh the US now and I was going to say<br>I I learned how to be a supervisor with<br>Alicia thank you Alicia uh no she was<br>amazing and the thing that she went<br>about doing in the lab was trying to<br>identify the inputs to the G&amp;R neurons<br>to map those inputs and see if they were<br>different in our model of PCOS and so<br>one way to do this is to label for pre<br>synaptic Terminals and so this is a G&amp;R<br>neuron and all these little red dots are<br>indicating these uh pre synaptic<br>Terminals and so she could map them<br>along the length of this input Zone to<br>the<br>cell and what she found was that there<br>was a significant increase in the amount<br>of input coming from these neurons that<br>signal with Gaba so what is Gaba this is<br>um a bit of Neuroscience<br>101 um so we'll start on this side and<br>then I'll go to this side so um Gaba is<br>a neurotransmitter it's secreted from<br>nerve terminals in the brain crosses<br>this little synaptic CFT and it binds to<br>a variety of receptors one of these<br>receptors is a channel that allows ions<br>to enter the cell and when it does that<br>it's generally inhibitory to cells but<br>the genh neurons are special they have<br>high intracellular chloride and so it<br>means that when Gaba signals to these<br>cells it can be excitatory so we'd found<br>this increase in inputs from a neuron<br>that can excite the G&amp;R neurons in a<br>model in which we have hyperactive<br>secretion of hormone from these<br>cells now this um data um aligned with<br>data that was coming out of other groups<br>and also with some evidence in the<br>clinic so we' known for quite a while<br>that Gaba acting anti-epileptic drugs<br>could drive a PCOS like phenotype or<br>PCOS features in otherwise<br>reproductively healthy women and more<br>recently it's been shown that PCOS<br>patients have a higher level of Gaba in<br>fluid I'll just pass that<br>one so um identifying this increase in<br>inputs to the GH neurons coming from<br>Gaba neurons was kind of exciting but we<br>needed to find out where these neurons<br>were coming from so another thing that<br>Alicia did was to take advantage of<br>transgenic tools and viruses that love<br>to pass through neurons<br>and she looked at different populations<br>of gaban neurons in the brain and<br>followed their long axons to see which<br>of those were connected with the GNR<br>neurons and you can see those here<br>labeled as red and she found that when<br>she targeted the population of Gaba<br>neurons in an area of the brain known as<br>the arcu nucleus which is an area uh we<br>know is important for steroid hormone<br>feedback and she followed the long axons<br>of these cells she found that many of<br>these axons were contacting the GnRH<br>neurons and if she looked in our animals<br>that model PCOS the amount of contact<br>from these neurons was nearly doubled so<br>we had identified a specific<br>circuit that appears to have enhanced<br>inovation to the GNR<br>neurons so this gave us um an anatomical<br>framework for a potential mechanism of<br>hyperactive uh regulation of the these<br>neurons in a PCOS like<br>state so then we wanted to ask several<br>other questions we wanted to know what<br>happens when we activate this circuit is<br>it actually a functional circuit if we<br>activate it do we get hormone secretion<br>and secondly is this thing that we're<br>seeing in the brain this miswiring is it<br>actually responsible for driving PCOS<br>like features so we wanted to<br>chronically activate this population and<br>see if we could recapitulate PCOS<br>features<br>developing and so the way that we did<br>this was using a couple of um novel<br>transgenic tools one of these is known<br>as optogenetics this allows us to turn<br>neurons on um acutely and what this does<br>is it uses light to turn specific<br>neurons on and<br>off to address whether chronic elevation<br>of this population drives PCOS features<br>we use something known as chemogenetics<br>uh this uses designer receptors and<br>designer drugs that allow us to dial up<br>populations and so this first question<br>was addressed by uh Dr Maro Silva who uh<br>was another PhD student my lab he's<br>since done a postdoc in France and he<br>now has a research position at at<br>Harvard so he took advantage of these<br>tools known as Channel redops so these<br>are blue light sensitive sodium channels<br>which means that if you shine a specific<br>wavelength of light onto them they open<br>the channel sodium ions come in and this<br>causes<br>excitation and so he was able to express<br>these receptors specifically in this<br>population of Gaba<br>neurons and then insert Optical fibers<br>that allowed him to flash this blue<br>light onto the terminals of these cells<br>excite them and get them to release<br>neurotransmitter and in the meantime he<br>measured hormone secretion from the<br>periphery so he flashes blue light he's<br>measuring hormones and what he found was<br>that when he turned the blue light on he<br>was able to drive secretion of<br>luteinizing hormone in the periphery and<br>this is a proxy for G&amp;R secretion coming<br>from the brain so this suggested that we<br>had a functional<br>circuit this next question was addressed<br>by Dr elod D roier who's was a wonderful<br>uh postto and research fellow in the lab<br>she had a hercus fellowship and she's<br>recently moved back to France to lead<br>her own<br>group so she took advantage of these uh<br>these other tools known as dreads which<br>stands for designer receptors<br>exclusively activated by designer<br>drugs and so these receptors could be<br>selectively expressed in our population<br>of Gaba neurons again<br>and then by delivering a designer drug<br>that only acts on this receptor we were<br>able to dial up the activity of these<br>neurons over<br>time and what she asked was whether in<br>reproductively fit animals increasing<br>the activity of this population over<br>time with the delivery of this designer<br>drug in the water would elicit the<br>development of these PCOS like<br>features and what she found without<br>showing you any graphs at all uh was<br>that this did recapitulate many of the<br>features of PCOS so we saw that these<br>animals had increased testosterone after<br>they'd been on this drug their estr<br>cyclicity was impaired um they had<br>evidence for reduced ovulation and a<br>trend toward hyperactivity of this<br>reproductive<br>axis so these data suggested that we'd<br>identified a functional circuit then<br>that when activated chronically was able<br>to drive PCOS suggesting that this<br>impairment was sufficient to drive PCOS<br>pathology so that raised several other<br>questions we wanted to know okay well<br>how does this happen when does this<br>circuit abnormality develop and really<br>importantly for Therapeutics can it be<br>reversed so these questions uh were<br>addressed by Maro and also another<br>really talented um um recently completed<br>PhD student in the lab Dr Aisha Sati and<br>what they did was to look at this<br>circuit and what might be causing these<br>changes over the life course of PCOS<br>development and what Mara found was that<br>at about 3 weeks of age in our model<br>just prior to pubertal Onset and this<br>increase in androgens that we<br>see the Gaba input to the g&amp;h neurons is<br>already elevated and elevated to levels<br>that we see in the adults so this is uh<br>this suggests that these wiring changes<br>are programmed early by this excess<br>Androgen<br>exposure and what Aisha did through her<br>PhD was to<br>identify that um probably what was<br>happening was involving these funnyl<br>looking cells here these are microa they<br>are the innate immune cells of the brain<br>and they're also really important in<br>pruning back copses in the developing<br>brain so they eat up all of the excess<br>copses that are not required to give an<br>adult appropriate complement of inputs<br>to Any Given cell so she found by<br>looking at a time point just prior to<br>when we see this enhanced Gaba input to<br>the GnRH neurons uh that something was<br>going on and so again we used transgenic<br>animals to do this so these animals have<br>green fluorescent protein in in the<br>microa this beautiful looking cell here<br>and what Aisha did was that she labeled<br>for fosic vesicles so these are<br>essentially the trash compactor of the<br>microglia so they eat up synapses that<br>are not required and they put the debris<br>into these vesicles and she also looked<br>for evidence of De debris from gabit<br>terminals specifically and so hopefully<br>if I do this you can see that a little<br>bit more closely so we turn around these<br>beautiful images that Aisha um oh let's<br>just go back one more<br>time there we<br>go um we'll just move right along we<br>have more moving microglia um hopefully<br>you can appreciate those trash<br>compactors of the cell here in blue and<br>the the pink here is the debris of uh<br>Gaba terminals that have been fagos toed<br>or eaten by these microglia so she was<br>able to measure this in our uh controls<br>and our PCOS like animals I'm not sure<br>what happened to my little movie here uh<br>but what she found was that there was a<br>reduced volume of gabit terminal debris<br>in the fosic vessicles of microa in our<br>brains from our PCOS like mice<br>suggesting that there's a reduction and<br>the refinement of these Gaba copses onto<br>the G&amp;R neurons and then that might<br>inovation but excitingly uh we find that<br>we can uh reverse these circuit changes<br>even though they've been programmed<br>early so this is maro's work and he<br>found that anti-androgen treatment uh<br>for several weeks was able to restore uh<br>completely normal level of Gaba input to<br>these G&amp;R neurons<br>and this was associated with a<br>restoration of cycling an improved<br>morphology of the ovary and evidence for<br>increased ovulation in these<br>animals and so of course we were very<br>interested in taking what we had learned<br>about this anti-androgen therapy that<br>was able to reduce this pathological<br>circuit and ask what's happening in<br>women and the ability to do this was<br>really born out of the time that I spent<br>on my research and study leave my RSL<br>and I just want to take a moment to<br>thank the University thank my department<br>for my research and study leave um such<br>an important time and I really value and<br>it's um it's paid back in dividends so<br>much for all the research we've been<br>doing in the lab so picked up the whole<br>family and for six months we hit the<br>road and we did a whole lot of things uh<br>including a lab project at the Suk<br>Institute in in Ed Callaway's lab which<br>is a whole additional talk which I won't<br>give you tonight um but during that time<br>importantly I got to spend some time<br>with this lovely woman Inger sunstrom<br>parama at the University of ubsa in<br>Sweden she's a research clinician In<br>Obstetrics and Gynecology and while I<br>was there we looked at some of her data<br>and we wrote a paper and we also thought<br>up some ways in which we could start to<br>probe the clinical data for how<br>anti-androgen therapy may impact<br>reproductive function in women with<br>PCOS and so that study became part of a<br>health research Council funded program<br>um that I lead alongside Greg Anderson<br>and Christine donon and all these lovely<br>people and um what we did and this<br>involved Elie here who's in the back<br>along with Inger and her colleague<br>evangelia elenis was to um look at<br>retrospective data retrospective<br>clinical data to ask um to look at the<br>association of anti-androgens and<br>fertility rate and essentially we found<br>two really important<br>things the uh and I I'll just tell you<br>first that uh what we did so we used the<br>amazing um patient data that's available<br>in Sweden so we had records from over<br>200,000 women and we we could ask about<br>their pcrs diagnosis um what uh drugs<br>they were taking we could look at their<br>fertility rate we could look at all this<br>amazing data and what we found was that<br>women uh that were hyper<br>androgenic had the lowest fertility rate<br>so these high androgens are um really<br>associated with impaired fertility and<br>importantly we found that if these women<br>were taking anti-androgen treatment<br>early they had a better fertility rate<br>than those who were initiating<br>anti-androgen treatment later and so<br>what this tells us is that early<br>diagnosis uh and treatment could be<br>really key in the prevention of<br>fertility related morbidity in women<br>with PCOS and this is really important<br>because anti-androgen therapies had<br>never been associated with any<br>restoration of reproductive function in<br>and so in the last part hopefully you<br>can take away these<br>messages um that we've been able to use<br>preclinical models to um make<br>discoveries about modified neuronal<br>wiring that might underpin PCOS<br>pathology and although these programs<br>appear to be um these changes appear to<br>be programmed we can reverse them with<br>anti-androgen drugs and retrospective<br>data suggests that early use of these<br>anti-androgens correlates with greater<br>fertility<br>rates so now I get to congratulate you<br>for making it through the heavy science<br>part of my talk well<br>done um and I hope that you will just<br>bear with me for a few more minutes uh<br>while I take a moment to just thank a<br>whole lot of really fabulous<br>people oh before I do that gotten ahead<br>of myself let me tell you what I'm doing<br>next um<br>so where have these studies led to what<br>we're doing now in the lab what we're<br>funded to do at the moment uh given what<br>we know now about anti-androgen therapy<br>restoring fertility we're really<br>interested in what the key Androgen<br>targets are in the brain so we're using<br>some really cool transgenic tools to<br>take Androgen receptors out of specific<br>cells and see how this impacts<br>reproductive function okay now I'm going<br>pictures okay so none of the work that<br>I've just shared with you would be<br>possible without<br>these incredible people so the members<br>of my laboratory team I'm just going to<br>cycle through some pictures of their<br>beautiful faces and the fun

it for me to<br>thank you for being here and listening<br>to me for this whole time and also for<br>taking time out to celebrate this with<br>okay<br>McDonald so my name is f McDonald and<br>I'm head of Department of physiology and<br>fortunate enough to be have been<br>Rebecca's um hod for the last nearly<br>five years and it's my pleasure to give<br>a formal thank you to Rebecca what a<br>wonderful talk um and many many<br>congratulations on your promotion and um<br>as I wrote the promotion application you<br>know it was very um so welld deserved um<br>so congratulations again and I want to<br>comment on a few of the things about<br>your talk that have really showcased<br>your strengths and things that we've<br>seen along your<br>journey um the passion that you have for<br>neurophysiology for those connections<br>you know that's very obvious and it's<br>clear now from your student days that<br>that that's been there for a long<br>time and and also you have this theme uh<br>you tried you know the ovary was always<br>there but you had to go via the brain to<br>to to get that connection between the<br>brain and reproductive function and<br>fertility and I remember cuz I was on<br>your interview panel in 2009 when we<br>employed you as a lecturer and you came<br>out of nowhere with this well I'm going<br>to work on PCOS and we all looked around<br>what is what is this you're a um a<br>neuroscientist um but it's so wonderful<br>to see that Journey that story that has<br>come through and you've made some<br>amazing contributions in that field you<br>have an International Community now that<br>you're part of and you know the future<br>is bright in terms of making a<br>difference and moving from the<br>preclinical to clinical which we're<br>really excited to<br>see one key theme I think of Rebecca's<br>work is her um getting ahead of the game<br>on the tools and whether it's<br>transgenics the dreads the Imaging<br>you're amazing you know all those years<br>in the PHD lab I'm sure getting the<br>Imaging and the working at the knobs on<br>the conf fcal you know that I think<br>that's been really pivotal for you to<br>get to where you are we all know that<br>putting in kind of those fresh exciting<br>techniques into your Grant applications<br>really make a difference so I think<br>that's something that you've done<br>incredibly well and used your<br>collaborations and connections as um to<br>enhance<br>that and then I think as well which has<br>been kind of touched on already is that<br>you have made made yourself big in the<br>international Arena and that's very<br>obvious from you know those PCOS gurus<br>who you know you collaborate with and<br>have published with that's very very<br>impressive we're in denen you know<br>they're all around the world and through<br>your work you've become part of that<br>community and as I think Neil said<br>you're involved in governing bodies for<br>PCOS for example that International PCOS<br>Society helping to organize conferences<br>that are the Pinnacle International<br>conferences and various editorial duties<br>reading chapters today um so working<br>with allowing scientists to to publish<br>their work in in a very good journals<br>but it's not only that your strength as<br>a as a researcher as kind of a a<br>colleague and a yeah superb um postgrad<br>Supervisor has meant that Rebecca's been<br>tapped on the shoulder and and or put<br>herself forward for these many roles<br>that support research in the department<br>um as yep my Deputy H research as um<br>chair of our research committee and<br>member of our research committee the<br>associate de research for the school<br>your post graduate um coordinator for a<br>couple years you 400 level convenor for<br>four years you've made an enormous<br>contribution to the research culture and<br>physiology so and that's really come<br>through again through your your journey<br>I guess and sharing with others and<br>supporting others so that's really I'm<br>appreciated and you have been recognized<br>for this through several Awards emerging<br>researcher award in the school level and<br>distinguished researcher award just a<br>couple of years ago on the school um so<br>you've brought you know the research but<br>it it moves out into all those other the<br>teaching the service and supporting um<br>an excellent culture of research<br>and finally I think um Rebecca has shown<br>us today her skills at scientific<br>communication you all know what a how<br>the brain controls fertility and<br>reproduction now so thank you so much<br>for that very clear and Illuminating um<br>talk so I think I'll just stop there and<br>say please join me again in thanking<br>and I have the pleasure of giving you a<br>gift on behalf of the university to mark<br>this occasion um so enjoy that thankk</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
