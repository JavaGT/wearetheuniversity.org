form<br>through the University of Auckland<br>website one of the questions that I<br>always get coming through is what should<br>I put in my CV and what should I write<br>about in the Russian statement so<br>starting with the CV we want to get a<br>broad sense of who you are as a human as<br>well as what your dance background is<br>and whatever you want to put into that<br>CV that you send to the most important<br>things about you you should write those<br>things down but some useful bits to<br>include are your dance background so<br>whatever dance learning you've done<br>leading up to this application point and<br>that might be your studio dance it might<br>be your crew that you're with your<br>hip-hop crew might be your NCA Dance<br>Experience it might be Community Dance<br>work performances that you've done<br>competitions it can be anything but<br>getting a sense of the overall pathway<br>of your dance interest and the different<br>influences that you've had are really<br>valuable for us to see we like to know<br>if you're engaged in the community<br>somewhere if you do work with your<br>church or with any local community<br>groups if you have been teaching dance<br>we want to know about that we want to<br>know what your interests are your other<br>Hobbies if you play basketball in the<br>weekend put that in<br>all of those things help us to get a<br>sense of what's important to you who you<br>are and what kind of person we might be<br>inviting into the program you also need<br>to provide a written statement and in<br>that it can be maybe a page or half a<br>page<br>really articulating perhaps why you want<br>to come to dance studies what you're<br>aiming to do when you graduate or<br>anything else about your dance Journey<br>or your life Journey that you want us to<br>know and we really value those two<br>documents because as I said we want to<br>know who you are as a person it's not<br>just about your dancing and your dance<br>background we're looking for<br>well-rounded humans who are going to<br>contribute back to dance studies just as<br>much as we help help you get where<br>you're going<br>um so that's step one from there you'll<br>be invited to join a workshop audition<br>were you nervous how was your experience<br>of auditioning no wasn't nerve-wracking<br>at all I think coming into the space it<br>felt very warm and inclusive and<br>everyone kind of got really stuck into<br>it I remember the the dance study<br>students who led the audition when I was<br>the auditioning they were really getting<br>the monster and then they allowed us to<br>kind of interact with each other and<br>co-create and form together the dance<br>rather than it kind of being a you're<br>there and I'm here type situation it was<br>really great just being able to relax<br>into the process and yeah I felt super<br>super comfortable and that's typically<br>held on a weekend and it is very<br>informal so you might think of an<br>audition<br>we have to wear a leotard and you have a<br>number and there's people at the front<br>of the room with a white tablecloth and<br>a cup of water it's not like that at all<br>we try to keep it really friendly I hope<br>it was friendly<br>um really friendly we have our students<br>our current students will teach that<br>Workshop have you taught that what yeah<br>yeah so you've been on both sides where<br>you've auditioned and you're in<br>facilitating yeah that Workshop usually<br>includes a warm-up maybe a game doing<br>some phrases of material so learning<br>learning some movement and then also<br>some choreographic work as well and in<br>that we want to see who you are how you<br>interact with other people in the room<br>what kind of energy you bring what kind<br>of person you are then at the end of<br>that session there's time for one-on-one<br>chats with the staff members who are<br>observing and we just want to get to<br>know you a little bit better but there's<br>also an opportunity for you to ask us<br>questions because it's just is important<br>that you know what you're getting<br>yourself into and that you feel like<br>dance studies is the right place for you<br>as well as us thinking about whether<br>you're a good fit for us while we're<br>doing those we really like for<br>applicants to chat to the current<br>students and through that process you<br>can ask them questions perhaps that you<br>think they might be able to answer<br>better or maybe you don't want to ask<br>the staff and we leave you to it to have<br>a chat with the current students to get<br>a sense of what dance studies life is<br>truly like as a student and that<br>audition process<br>we don't look for the perfect dancer<br>with a particular body type<br>you should turn up as who you are we<br>want you to wear what you're comfortable<br>wearing we don't need you to bring any<br>particular dance gear you don't need to<br>prepare a solo or anything to perform to<br>us we will facilitate that workshop and<br>show you everything that you need to<br>learn along the way<br>um we try and keep it fun and friendly<br>and with a bit of banter and a bit of<br>laughter because if you're feeling</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
