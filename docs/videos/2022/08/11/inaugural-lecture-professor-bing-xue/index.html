distinguished<br>guests to colleagues<br>to students<br>and to our broader public<br>to the inaugural lecture<br>of professor of artificial intelligence<br>being sure<br>from the school of engineering<br>and computer science<br>i'm jennifer windsor acting vice<br>chancellor of teherangawaka victoria<br>university of wellington and it's a<br>really great pleasure to see all of you<br>this evening<br>and to recognize the work of someone who<br>has been an extraordinarily impactful<br>member of our university community for<br>over a decade<br>professor zhi is a world leading expert<br>in artificial intelligence<br>she first joined our university as a phd<br>student in 2010<br>she was named a professor in 2021<br>now what's immediately obvious from this<br>time frame<br>is that bing has moved through our<br>academic ranks to professor unusually<br>and extraordinarily quickly<br>and while it's very tempting to make<br>much of the time frame itself<br>it's the underlying importance<br>innovation and generative nature of her<br>career to which i'd like to draw most<br>attention here<br>with her colleagues and broader research<br>group<br>bing has packed a great deal into this<br>time and she's made superb contributions<br>and been a great influencer across<br>research<br>teaching engagement and in her<br>leadership<br>she achieved our early career research<br>excellence award in 2017<br>and the research excellence award in<br>2019<br>she supervised over 50 students and is<br>known to be deeply invested in the<br>academic journeys of each of them<br>indeed she was awarded the faculty of<br>engineering supervisor of the year award<br>in 2018.<br>i believe that professor joy is also now<br>deputy head of school<br>and she will lead the new artificial<br>intelligence major in 2023<br>she's also part of a group of people in<br>the faculty of engineering supporting<br>female<br>and gender diverse students<br>and she chairs<br>the woman in engineering affinity group<br>for a new zealand chapter of the<br>institute of electrical and electronics<br>engineers<br>she is the first woman<br>to be named professor in our faculty of<br>engineering<br>artificial intelligence<br>ai<br>machine based learning of data<br>ai can have significant benefits in its<br>relative speed efficiency<br>user access<br>that humans can't quite do yet<br>and so in its ability to solve very<br>complex data problems it has some<br>immediate and important applicability to<br>a whole wide range of real world problem<br>spaces whether that's biology<br>medicine aquaculture<br>transportation entertainment you name it<br>this is work of the future as well as<br>work of the now<br>and much of bing's work for which he<br>secured over 20 million dollars in<br>funding<br>isn't the basics it's in data mining<br>feature selection classification and<br>image analysis<br>swarm intelligence and evolutionary<br>computation<br>the idea of computer programs<br>continually evolving or improving from<br>an originally random group of programs<br>i'm going to give just one example of<br>the impact of bing's research program<br>her work on ai algorithms to detect skin<br>cancer from excuse me to detect skin<br>cancer from images has been cited all<br>around the world<br>and it could provide a future early<br>detection method for skin cancer<br>so<br>what bing does in this basic science<br>approach i would argue as potent<br>exhilarating and aspirational<br>and in her inaugural<br>bing will discuss the ai work she and<br>colleagues are doing<br>that very well may help us all shape a<br>sustainable and inequitable future for<br>us all<br>aspirational indeed<br>and perhaps<br>many congratulations and thank you<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce<br>professor bing ji<br>thanks jennifer and tina koto tina koto<br>tina koto kotwa<br>thanks everyone for coming to minogue<br>lecture especially in this very cold<br>so i'm professor of artificial<br>intelligence many of you know me so or<br>you can from tell i'm from china and<br>china have the largest population in the<br>world and my province have the largest<br>population in china<br>but this map is not about the population<br>for some some of you probably can guess<br>so this map is actually about how<br>difficult to enter the university in<br>china so the difficulty of the<br>myself unfortunately<br>but probably not unexpected<br>as i were had to take my university<br>entry exam<br>in the central china in this year the<br>black the province with black color<br>this<br>our province this year has a 1.2<br>1.2.5 million<br>students<br>takes the university entry exam<br>that's where i did my my undergraduate<br>and then<br>i moved down to the south to another<br>province with a black color<br>so<br>over the years i have been very lucky i<br>had to say with a difficult time when i<br>was very young so prepared me very well<br>for the future<br>then we talk about artificial<br>intelligence you know we often talk<br>about artificial intelligence so ai's<br>but it's everywhere is<br>and it's it's not only one thing so it's<br>a multi-disciplinary area<br>and whole of my academic career<br>from my undergraduate to a master's math<br>study i found out that actually i have<br>always been in the multi-disciplinary<br>areas<br>i did my undergraduates<br>i was doing the major information<br>management and information system<br>this is a major that you may find it in<br>a different school<br>at different universities you know some<br>university head in the school for<br>business school of management and school<br>for information science or school for<br>computer science<br>i think i was very lucky i was together<br>with the school for computer science i<br>will be able to learn a lot of computer<br>science courses in my undergraduate<br>then i moved to a master study<br>and<br>the corresponding master's degree there<br>in china was management science and<br>engineering<br>i did that in sunday university in china<br>with various thoughts in china next to<br>and i did that in the management<br>school and as in my university so there<br>was another i would do the science<br>version of management science and<br>engineering there is an engineering<br>version of management science and<br>engineering so i go study a lot of<br>engineering courses during my master's<br>study<br>and a group of supervisors in our school<br>in the management school was passionate<br>with computer science so they love<br>patent recognition distributed computing<br>at that time<br>so i got to learn courses from again<br>from computer science in the master<br>level<br>however<br>i feel so have learned many many many<br>different courses<br>and also statistics operational research<br>mathematics<br>even economics<br>accounting marketing all those things<br>i feel like a law i know a lot of things<br>i also feel slow i know nothing<br>i don't know where my career is going to<br>be<br>at some point of my master's study<br>i actually<br>enjoyed the test to do<br>cpi i thought i probably can work as a<br>content<br>then after that i changed my mind<br>because we do finance courses i thought<br>i probably can do c f a so that gave me<br>until<br>i go with my friend take a course called<br>data mining machine learning<br>i was amazed how this algorithm can<br>discover the patterns from the data that<br>i never thought about<br>how they classify or group data<br>into different different classes<br>and how they visualize the data<br>until now i feel like now i found my<br>passion<br>so i did my thesis master thesis<br>kind of using artificial intelligence<br>algorithms<br>then i decided to have a career in<br>artificial intelligence i studied my i<br>applied<br>to study overseas<br>and i was lucky enough in 2010 i got a<br>scholarship from victoria university<br>wellington from my university now and<br>study here<br>i feel like i start working artificial<br>intelligence that kind of open the door<br>to a new world<br>that's i feel passionate about<br>and<br>i submitted my sister at the end of 2013<br>the general president graduated around<br>2013 or 2014-ish<br>and has always been with<br>vuw since 2010<br>so i did my post talk i did my lecture<br>and senior lecturer<br>associate professor and now i'm a food<br>professor and that's why i'm giving this<br>so with my career path<br>so the the<br>the most question i got is people think<br>do you sleep<br>i didn't go there today from jennifer<br>again<br>and yes<br>there's many many times my husband would<br>say you're crazy right<br>whenever he wake up he wake up at the<br>end of the night with two o'clock maybe<br>three o'clock i'm still working i will<br>see you become very angry about it<br>but i feel like there's more things<br>because i really love the research i did<br>but the longer time i stay here at this<br>university with small roles i become a<br>supervisor and the lecturer i'm teaching<br>and program directors and also deputy<br>head of school<br>i feel like i'm so lucky to have a<br>student career that's<br>but of course the only many other stuff<br>you know the with your career progress<br>you have a lot of other stuff you have<br>those tasks responsibilities and<br>meetings you see this on the professor's<br>calendar you hardly find any space in<br>their calendar to book a meeting<br>so how many people asking that how you<br>manage that<br>you know i use one of the important<br>terms one of important<br>techniques in artificial intelligence<br>it's very important that i call it<br>multitask<br>i do many things at the same time<br>so i'll touch that point later as well<br>so that's what i at<br>university outside the university<br>in the international community<br>so<br>it's actually<br>only the past let's say six seven years<br>or five six years<br>you know i have been working<br>in many different areas<br>so<br>from the conference in term<br>international conferences at the pc<br>member<br>and<br>now these days i'm becoming a general<br>chair or comp inviter the general chair<br>of conference chairs<br>so one of the major conferences actually<br>we hosted<br>here in 2019 the iwo congress on<br>evolution computation so that was the<br>largest conference in the illusion<br>computation research area<br>and has never been hosted in new zealand<br>so<br>so we beat the conference<br>and there was become a very successful<br>conference in the ipoe computing tennis<br>society history<br>and professor margaret helen gave us<br>a speech in the conference dinner<br>for that conference i will be a<br>conference chair for 2024 that has been<br>already decided<br>last year<br>and for journals<br>you know<br>will become some stage of your when your<br>publication your research get noticed by<br>others and you will be invited to be uh<br>like the associate associate editors<br>so i become the social editors of nearly<br>10 journals<br>including almost all the top journals in<br>my field<br>and earlier this year i was invited to<br>consider to be editor-in-chief of one of<br>the free transaction journals<br>and for the first time i said no<br>sorry i need some sleep<br>and also i feel like i have many<br>students here at the university and i<br>have<br>at some point you have to prioritize<br>what you do<br>and then commit<br>international committees and volunteers<br>and also international talks you know at<br>the beginning you give<br>paper presentation international<br>conferences<br>and this year i then in recent years i<br>started being invited to give k notes to<br>give tutorials<br>and also this year i was invited by ipp<br>congress world congress on computer<br>intelligence<br>that's the conference normally have 2<br>000 people over 2000 people next is a<br>combination of three big conferences in<br>evolution computation in<br>fuzzy systems and neural networks<br>so i just gave the plenary talk<br>in<br>july so just a few weeks two weeks ago<br>so i was particularly proud of this<br>plenary talk because in 2010<br>so one of the plenary talk was given<br>by a turing test<br>turn award winner<br>the two award winner is like the nobel<br>prize in artificial intelligence it's<br>the highest specific<br>dis recognition awards in the computing<br>and there's a lot of other work they<br>have been doing for for example women in<br>computing intelligence society that have<br>been helping many women students or<br>female early career researchers for<br>developing their careers as well so i<br>have i'm passionate with doing that i'm<br>still doing that for me for many years<br>so with all those my research<br>and uh there's another award that i just<br>announced so i was awarded the<br>2023 iop computing channel society<br>outstanding early career award<br>so i mentioned this award because it's a<br>super super difficult to have to be to<br>get this award<br>so that again across three areas in<br>natural pre-computing intelligence<br>and people were saying this is even<br>harder for than a pioneer award because<br>pioneer award for the three areas<br>because three awards three persons got<br>hit every year and this one you got only<br>one person<br>it hires a very high standards in some<br>years because no one got it<br>so i will have i will receive this award<br>this award in next in summer the<br>conference one of the conferences<br>so<br>now talk about myself let's talk about<br>more about artificial intelligence<br>so i'm not sure how many of you have<br>great so this is a movie that released<br>in 20 2001 directed by steven<br>spielberg so that's a very famous<br>director<br>so this is a very good movie<br>so it tells you a few<br>very beautiful but sad stories<br>about artificial intelligence about<br>robots<br>and<br>humanized the problems<br>but in particular this little boy in the<br>middle<br>he has a very sad story he was adopted<br>by a family<br>but then later was abandoned by the<br>family because the real boy in the<br>family can forgive this robot to doing<br>something that considered being<br>dangerous to human but this voice<br>actually robert is a very kind<br>person kind of personality<br>he got emotions<br>in with the fan when he's staying with<br>the family<br>and there was a really good story and a<br>lot of things we still should think<br>about it in from this movie<br>so actually there was a one thing<br>you know the you know we think about<br>whether is ai being dangerous or is a<br>and there's one thing actually i don't<br>believe i did not believe it's true i do<br>not believe the artificial intelligence<br>robots can have emotions i still do not<br>believe<br>but this movie kind of at that time made<br>me believe one thing artificial<br>intelligence or about robots as i was<br>intense that's what 21 years ago<br>but still then many people at this time<br>still have this misconception<br>if you google artificial intelligence<br>from google images you'll find many<br>images we have a robot there but we<br>often say artificial intelligence not<br>about robots not only about robots it's<br>and then come to 20 2015 2016.<br>okay<br>now many people<br>knows this knows artificial intelligence<br>from this<br>half ago from the go challenge match<br>and many from this news as many people<br>start thinking artificial intelligence<br>deep learning okay<br>so artificial intelligence equals to<br>deep learning<br>or people know a bit more of artificial<br>intelligence they will say oh actually<br>artificial intelligence equals to<br>machine learning and machine learning<br>including deep learning<br>and even more and people will say<br>actually you know that deep learning is<br>deep neural networks<br>so then you'll see artificial<br>intelligence equals machine learning<br>extra deep learning excellent deep<br>well<br>it's not true right many of us know it's<br>not true<br>so my artificial intelligence is a lot<br>more than just machine learning and like<br>just deep learning<br>so if we define so what is artificial<br>intelligence<br>i have to say there's no agree the<br>definition you can define artificial<br>intelligence from many different point<br>of views<br>so some of the key points<br>in terms of think<br>sense or act<br>so that involves<br>like humans<br>that think who acts like humans<br>as a group together<br>based on the early definitions from the<br>father of<br>of ai john mccarthy so our ai group<br>come up with this following definition<br>so actually intelligence is a science<br>and engineering of in making intelligent<br>machines that can<br>act learn from experience to perform<br>tasks for human<br>so the first half of this definition is<br>not we created it's actually<br>we inherited from the very early<br>definition<br>we particularly like particularly like<br>the science and engineering of making<br>intelligent machines<br>this justified very well<br>that we offering artificial intelligence<br>degrees and science degree and in the<br>so<br>if we define artificial intelligence<br>so<br>you know these days if you're talking<br>about the most advanced<br>techniques intoxicating intelligence<br>unfortunately still deep learning<br>i see a lot about different neural<br>networks<br>whenever you go to very difficult tasks<br>you know if you don't know what<br>technique to try okay try deep learning<br>try different neural networks<br>so you can even dream even bigger right<br>this<br>is the beginning i talk about the<br>multi-task learning in artificial<br>intelligence<br>so the lead of google ai so jeff ding<br>who proposed an idea last year in<br>october 2021 he talked about<br>a pathway<br>a new<br>large-scale multi-task learning<br>architecture<br>the idea is to build a single model<br>that can generalize across millions of<br>tasks you can generalize many tasks as<br>you want<br>so but bring a single model<br>and then in made this year just two or<br>three months ago the worker published<br>the using a evolutionary approach<br>to build this large-scale multi-task<br>learning system<br>they will be able<br>to achieve to address simultaneously<br>68<br>image classification tasks<br>and achieved<br>status results<br>the task destiny considers including the<br>most very very difficult tasks for<br>example the imagenet c510 of c500<br>each of them was considered is<br>considered as a difficult task in many<br>so that's amazing results<br>so using the evolutionary approach<br>which victoria university of wellington<br>so we have a world leading research<br>group in evolutionary computation we're<br>also doing the research on evolution<br>competition for the automatic design of<br>deep neural network architectures<br>but we're not even close to this point<br>well the thing is when we're looking at<br>you know you probably say that you<br>well actually after this system was<br>published after the paper was published<br>many people were not happy with it<br>the reason is<br>look at<br>how much resources they needed<br>for a single run it needs<br>178<br>810 tpu hours that equals to 57<br>thousand us dollars<br>okay i was talking looking at counting<br>my fundings i had a master<br>that i got that's a must now go to seven<br>hundred thousand dollar u.s new zealand<br>dollars that has been that i need to<br>pass two runs of the proposals<br>and for computer science for ist the<br>passing rate is about five percent<br>and the whole master fund i will be able<br>to run<br>7.57 runs for his single system<br>but wait is it even worse<br>because before i will be able to run<br>this system i will need to do probably<br>hundreds so from thousand times of<br>parameter tuning for the architecture<br>if i counting all the funding they have<br>in the research group or probably in the<br>school in the faculty i would still<br>wouldn't be able to get this point until<br>so that's why<br>many many people in the internet would<br>discuss that you know we don't believe<br>on the research they did by these top<br>institutions<br>and that comes to another point about<br>artificial intelligence recent years<br>people were saying so the advances about<br>hatchery intelligence is more about the<br>hardware right you do a lot of resources<br>you can do a lot of things then you can<br>get the good results<br>as one of the researchers who work at an<br>institut at the university or<br>institution that who do not have<br>thousands ten thousands of computation<br>resources<br>but now it feels like a sudden find a<br>different way to think about it<br>i think positively<br>those research tell us what is possible<br>they use a lot of results now our task<br>is to find a way to reduce the<br>computational<br>cost<br>i suddenly feel it gave me a great idea<br>for my next mastering proposal<br>see this is what's possible and i'm<br>so actually that leads to some of the<br>research we're currently doing<br>so we're doing the ultimate design of<br>the deep learning models<br>so this is a topic we have been working<br>on that for several years<br>so the very first work kind of in the<br>neural architecture search was did by<br>google<br>again they used thousands of gpus that<br>way probably for so many years with all<br>our fundings we believe we have very<br>good amount of fundings we got how many<br>55<br>but their system got easily thousands of<br>gpus needed<br>but<br>we will still be able to get to<br>work<br>on new technologies new algorithms to<br>reduce the computing power and increase<br>the accuracies<br>so the work we did is to ultimately<br>design architecture without<br>trying an error of parameter tunings or<br>and actually if i describe in a very<br>simple way or straightforward way is for<br>example here is a deep neural network<br>architecture<br>and the words it looks like you have a<br>lot of blocks it's like the kids playing<br>lego<br>but of course if you generalize you can<br>imagine the search space is a thousand<br>times bigger<br>and then we design new techniques to<br>explore the surfaces effectively and<br>efficiently<br>so to show just some ideas<br>so we are using evolution computation<br>algorithm to automate design of the deep<br>learning models<br>in the other beginning the core probably<br>start with the three of a small model<br>and it can literally grow into a bigger<br>model<br>and with a better performance<br>and at the end it will give us<br>normally it will give us<br>a brand new<br>not manually designed do not need<br>a lot of trial error or domain expertise<br>design network that help us to improve<br>the classification performance for<br>example on the image data set<br>so this is what we have been doing and<br>last month the my plenary talk is about<br>using evolution computation for design<br>of<br>so<br>good the deep neural networks<br>give us the promising performance on<br>many many different<br>tasks what is the limitations they have<br>for the deep learning models the problem<br>is it's often have a huge<br>architecture in terms of architecture we<br>say it's many hundreds or even thousands<br>of layers in the network<br>that leads to<br>millions<br>hundreds of millions of parameters<br>okay you for example you give them a<br>task to distinguish to classify the<br>image as a wolf or a dog<br>you pass the image to the huge neural<br>network<br>as it gave you a label<br>however you have no idea what did the<br>neural network do what does the deep<br>model do<br>how does it comes to give us a label as<br>a wolf or a dog<br>unfortunately in many cases<br>it tells me tell us something that's<br>something even not misleading but<br>sometimes even wrong<br>for example distinguish these two images<br>if we go deeper to the model sometimes<br>we find<br>it's the label of the wolf is more of<br>the label of the background being the<br>snow<br>if you take off<br>the the the objects of the wolf or the<br>dog<br>but just give the background it still<br>gave you the label<br>so we have no idea so how the neural<br>network making this<br>the decision<br>this is this is the dangers right<br>so if we don't know how the decisions<br>were made<br>how can we trust the model<br>especially on the very um<br>critical areas for example<br>disease<br>diagnosis<br>or some other very important areas<br>so we can't believe we can't trust those<br>systems then<br>so the idea is we need to do it explore<br>unexplainable models<br>so following some of the work that we<br>have been doing in our research group as<br>well so we develop tree-based models<br>okay<br>so with the three-piece model instead of<br>the network-based model you will be able<br>or it's much easier to follow the<br>decision-making process<br>here's the three you can looking at from<br>the leaf nodes let's step by step<br>combine decisions<br>and come up with a final decision<br>we also doing a lot of feature learning<br>for example to select features<br>to select the most important features<br>let's say<br>five features from hundreds of thousands<br>of features those five are the most<br>important features that affect your<br>decision making so they are the most<br>critical causes for the problem<br>for example here what we have for the<br>common data set<br>for this data set<br>if you can imagine it's a it's a<br>spreadsheet so it has<br>7129 columns<br>so each represent that feature so each<br>of them was provided to us and asked us<br>to do a classification task tell us this<br>row<br>is belong to two classes one o or aml<br>so represented by a blue and a red color<br>out of this over 7000 features our model<br>will be able to construct a very simple<br>a very simple trace structure<br>that can perfectly separate these two<br>classes<br>but get rid of the features<br>or the attribute columns that are<br>relevant to the task will be able to<br>focus on the most informative most<br>relevant information from the data<br>and though we'll be able to follow how<br>the three make decisions<br>it can as simple as just use a very<br>simple arithmetic operators to combine<br>them<br>and to perfectly separate instance of<br>different classes<br>but of course<br>this will be a relative simple example<br>for difficult tasks we still need to<br>have a very difficult a<br>kind of a large tree to make a decision<br>but at least by selecting the most<br>important features<br>and by using the tree-based model allow<br>us to looking at how the decision was<br>made from the leaf node to the parents<br>node internals and up until the root<br>notes will be able at least potentially<br>the following the decision making<br>process to understand how the decisions<br>were made<br>so that gave us the potential to do the<br>explainable ii to build interpretable<br>as a lot of research we have been doing<br>we have we have done and<br>so<br>under more of recent years<br>instead of we were doing what we are<br>good at<br>the ai research and we're looking at<br>what we are good for our research are<br>good for<br>so apparently ai<br>is helpful in everywhere so we are using<br>but you know where should we you where<br>should ai<br>do what you know what ai should be<br>allowed to do<br>right that's something that's not only<br>about ethics<br>it can sometimes become a legal thing<br>right it's about the privacy and who is<br>using the ai techniques the more<br>powerful the ai techniques<br>is actually can be more disruptive<br>and<br>there are there are weapons using ai<br>system to build for the ai system used<br>by the wrong person the more powerful<br>the more dangerous it can be<br>what we need to do is to build a system<br>that is bias free<br>that count for human values<br>and that is transparent accountable and<br>i mean are the different factors we need<br>to consider<br>and those systems<br>should factor those affect all those<br>factors<br>within the decision making process<br>in some especially in some morally<br>significant situations<br>so that means that we need a lot of<br>policies regulations and laws to<br>regulate when we need to with artificial<br>intelligence and this has been another<br>very hot topic recently kind of<br>research in mind<br>so looking at what we have been doing<br>here so one of the examples given so<br>jennifer also talk about the examples<br>that we did in our research<br>so here we're also using the tray-based<br>machine learning model to do skin cancer<br>detection<br>skin cancer<br>is one of the top<br>deadly cancer for<br>in the in the world and for new zealand<br>it's particularly<br>not in the good situations particularly<br>that over 300 new zealanders die because<br>of the melanoma<br>so what we have done so we built a<br>tree-based model that can automatically<br>detect and classify<br>benign images or melanoma images<br>by feeding them the images to the<br>tray-based model<br>and the system automatically learn this<br>model<br>and more importantly we will be able to<br>see what featured or what information<br>are captured by this tree-based model<br>for this particular example we're<br>looking at there's one feature<br>highlighted in pink so there's a feature<br>154<br>and we're looking back to the data<br>we found this this particular feature is<br>captured the corner<br>of the moor in the image<br>and this<br>corner<br>is<br>is one of the rules that's used by<br>dermatologists in clinics<br>so that explains why our model using<br>this feature to make this particular<br>decision<br>and so that's something we have been<br>working on and we are we will be<br>continue working on that<br>some other regions<br>called biomarker identification<br>so<br>biomarkers was treated as how<br>cancers<br>release their secret<br>so they can appear in different forms<br>so also we're using our techniques<br>for our particular example for example<br>this called apple plus mz dataset<br>it have<br>7763 features<br>you can consider 77<br>1773<br>columns in the spreadsheet okay<br>among them so five of them are<br>labeled as biomarkers by the expert by<br>biologists<br>so that are the key<br>we need to looking for<br>and our algorithm i'll be able to find<br>all of the five<br>and also in the tree model structure the<br>ubc able to see them<br>so actually<br>our<br>ai system is more creative<br>so not only find these five biomarkers<br>it found something different as well<br>it found some other combinations of<br>features from the 700 733<br>features they found another combination<br>this also can perfectly achieve 100<br>accuracy for distinguish<br>the incidence of different classes so<br>dizzy for example disease can cancer or<br>not cancer<br>so that is particularly important<br>because that tells us<br>more about the problem domain they give<br>insights to the dominant experts<br>and provide enable the deeper<br>understanding of the problems so that<br>means they are introductions interaction<br>between the features<br>because of the interaction that will<br>never be we never thought of is actually<br>that can also tell us whether the person<br>so this is another so another example we<br>have been working on<br>is the muscle farm<br>we have one working on the mast farm<br>particularly<br>we currently working on the muscle float<br>avoid detection<br>so<br>this is a very beautiful picture of the<br>month of farm<br>but in a bad weather<br>it's completely different<br>so with the wind with storm day<br>the many farms lost many of these boys<br>it would blow to everywhere in the beach<br>so our algorithms was to detect without<br>you sending a person in a very bad day<br>to the sea<br>we<br>we use the camera there and we're using<br>algorithm sitting in the lab to<br>ultimately detect whether<br>and how many of the boys have lost<br>and we will be able to<br>after the day we'll be able to send this<br>farm to the workers to fix this problem<br>and also task is<br>those boys are fixed<br>when they first plant these muscles<br>without very very little<br>and you can imagine with the growth of<br>the muscles is becoming heavier and the<br>boys appear to draw down<br>and our system was to<br>detect how when and how many we need to<br>add more muscle flows there<br>so that<br>will significantly reduce the human<br>labor and also and the of course money<br>involved<br>so this is another project we're working<br>on is the fish for the fish industry<br>so we are kind of working this a lot<br>with the plant and food research crown<br>research institute<br>so we work with the plant set side and<br>also the food side<br>with the plant side we work with team<br>that we're using ai techniques<br>to<br>estimate the length of the fish without<br>actually catching the fish<br>based on the length of the fish and<br>other data will automatically predict<br>the weight of the fish<br>and monitoring the growth of the fish<br>and predict the health condition<br>and also estimate or plan the feedings<br>and<br>after the fish was kept<br>so work with another group kind of form<br>full side of the plant food research<br>institute we're working on the cyber<br>marine projects<br>that's to find a way to maximize how to<br>utilize to maximal value of the fish and<br>how much of the fish should go to the<br>restaurant how much of the fish to doing<br>fish oils<br>how much of them going to exams so there<br>are different ways that we we're using<br>the historic data to learn model and to<br>maximize their value<br>so those are all the new zealand primary<br>industries<br>some more that's closely related to us<br>wellington trees identifications<br>not sure many how many you know that's<br>actually in new zealand every 10 years<br>the the nissan government will scan<br>the tree of all trees in one city of new<br>zealand<br>the last time this scan the city was<br>wellington<br>and we work with another crown research<br>institute lance here<br>with a joint project with singapore<br>they're working with working on<br>identification of the wellington trees<br>you see the tree on the street the each<br>of them have a label and we have the the<br>remote sensing images we can find this<br>in the database<br>our task is to segment different trees<br>and to develop systems that can<br>automatically identify the species of<br>the trees<br>so in order to monitoring<br>the whole<br>the trees in the whole wellington region<br>and also from generalized to other<br>so some of these those are some examples<br>that we're working on<br>so i'm not able to list all the work we<br>will do we have been doing<br>so we're actually currently<br>having proposing<br>the<br>the uw<br>data science and the ai center<br>so<br>so working with professor monte john i<br>believe and richard and myself we have<br>for the past<br>years or more that we have with the<br>support from the division from the<br>faculty<br>so we are developing these<br>data science and ai center<br>our vision is to achieve research<br>excellence<br>and innovation and sustainable data<br>science ai<br>of focus<br>to develop advanced fundamental research<br>innovative masters techniques<br>4k<br>applications<br>now leading to<br>the knowledge advancement with<br>significant impact<br>economic social environmental and health<br>outcomes<br>here are we have<br>we have six technology themes<br>which we have international reputation<br>or leadership<br>and we have different application<br>domains<br>most most of them working on the primary<br>industry and the important areas that<br>closely related to our daily life<br>particularly for new zealand<br>and we also work with maori and the<br>pacific invasion much longer<br>we have a lot of planning around there<br>and we hope that we'll be able to show<br>so we're not only doing research we're<br>not only doing publications we're not<br>only applying fundings<br>we also as a group<br>doing our as a lecture as an exam staff<br>at the university so we are not only<br>doing our own research we are also<br>focusing only<br>education<br>we this year we developed the very first<br>new zealand very first and only<br>so we start from next year<br>we were actually<br>the very first one who developed the<br>postgraduate majors in ai that started<br>in 2021 and has been going very<br>successfully<br>okay so that's<br>my talk i would like to thanks<br>all the people i have been working with<br>you know my colleagues my postdoc<br>students in particularly many of you<br>know professor montjejang<br>so the most important person in my<br>career<br>he's probably also the most important<br>last but not least<br>my family<br>the other two most important person in<br>my life<br>my husband dr emin hong he's also he has<br>the phd in artificial intelligence<br>he's he's the best<br>husband i can ever imagine<br>so<br>when we first sit together he said his<br>goal is to support me become a professor<br>now i achieve the goal achieve our goal<br>you probably should think about the next<br>goal<br>all right thanks everyone this is of my<br>my name is essan mizbahi<br>i'm the pro vice chancellor for<br>wellington faculties of science health<br>engineering architecture and design<br>innovation<br>and i'm delighted<br>to give the world of thanks to professor<br>bing shu<br>for tonight's lecture<br>what i'm going to say now is not really<br>it's not that written in here the<br>subject of artificial intelligence is<br>very close to my heart<br>and you can imagine how difficult for me<br>is not to talk about it<br>um<br>i really enjoyed your presentation that<br>it looked like from the time i started<br>doing artificial intelligence how much<br>change has been there<br>when i started working artificial<br>intelligence i'm telling you there was<br>no computers around<br>so you can imagine um what would it look<br>like<br>is the world leader in the future<br>defining interdisciplinary field of<br>artificial intelligence<br>tonight we have had just the glimpse<br>into the cutting edge of artificial<br>intelligence research that professor xu<br>and her colleagues have been undertaking<br>in the areas of machine learning<br>data mining and image analysis<br>and she showed their efforts to solve a<br>range of real world problems<br>a very great example of<br>not showing what you're good at but for<br>your good for<br>professor xu has demonstrated just how<br>far-reaching and transformative<br>the outcomes of<br>her research can be<br>advancing all aspects of our lives from<br>healthcare agriculture aquaculture and<br>beyond<br>a lecture reminds us of the importance<br>important role of university<br>in building the future of our society<br>and our communities<br>by providing the space to pursue<br>knowledge<br>and<br>apply knowledge into different fields of<br>professor<br>sustained excellence and leadership in<br>this field has significantly contributed<br>to the university's international<br>reputation<br>in artificial intelligence and machine<br>learning<br>one of victoria university of<br>one of victor university of wellington's<br>key strengths is preparing our students<br>for the jobs and challenges of the<br>future and this is something that<br>professor xu<br>truly<br>exemplifies<br>her career has gone from his strength to<br>strength<br>twice she has been awarded the<br>prestigious marsden fund grant the<br>hallmark of excellence for research in<br>new zealand<br>she was also the recipient of victoria<br>university's staff excellence awards in<br>both 2017 and 2020 as noted<br>by acting voice chancellor<br>as a passionate teacher researcher and<br>director of our innovative artificial<br>intelligence programs<br>she has been an invaluable asset to the<br>school of engineering and computer<br>science<br>and an exceptional role model for women<br>in engineering<br>ping<br>you're amazing<br>this is probably the most<br>exciting part of my job to stand here<br>and then talk about my professors<br>it's my pleasure<br>and it's our university's pleasure to<br>congratulate you on the fantastic<br>inaugural professional professorial<br>lecture<br>and with this i would like to invite<br>everyone today here to join us in the<br>common room outside for some<br>refreshments<br>but if but first before i leave you i<br>would like you to join me again to thank<br>professor xu for such a fantastic</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
