everything<br>else that isn't design.<br>Design is about bringing<br>together the content of life<br>and finding ways for us to engage with it.<br>(upbeat music)<br>I guess if we think about<br>design in its traditional sense,<br>we think of objects, we<br>think of cool objects,<br>but it's really a changing space.<br>Design is also about experiences,<br>how we engage with things,<br>just think about your phone.<br>So what we need to be able to do,<br>and what we need to<br>understand about people<br>is so much more than it ever was before.<br>Really the study of design<br>is so much broader than just<br>aesthetics or form finding,<br>it's really about people.<br>(upbeat music)<br>One of the biggest<br>questions you're probably<br>asking yourself is what do I need to be?<br>Who do I need to be?<br>What do I need to know to<br>come to the School of Design.<br>If you're the kind of student<br>that likes drawing or likes being creative<br>or like working in teams<br>or likes collaboration.<br>If you're the kind of<br>student that likes robotics,<br>if you're the kind of student<br>that likes website design<br>or photography, there's<br>a lot of different things<br>that design as a field can hold for you.<br>And here in the School<br>of Design Innovation,<br>we aim to offer first year<br>students a world-class experience<br>that really can expose you<br>to lots of different ways<br>of communicating and making and working.<br>And the world of design<br>can really open up a lot<br>of different pathways<br>for absolutely anybody.<br>I guess a big question<br>is who needs a designer?<br>Who needs design?<br>Well, everything and everyone.<br>If you're a person that cares about<br>the way that we experience the world,<br>whether that's the way we travel<br>through an environment like<br>an airport or a hospital<br>or a public space,<br>and how you sort of navigate those spaces<br>and wayfinding and communication,<br>or the way that we interact<br>with each other in different<br>environments, whether that's<br>in our physical environment<br>or in an online environment,<br>If you're someone that is interested<br>in the way that social media<br>is impacting our communities,<br>if you're interested in<br>sustainability and how that is<br>really vital part of every conversation<br>that we should be having as designers<br>or as students, or as citizens.<br>This course has all of these<br>different elements converging<br>in different classroom<br>environments, in different projects.<br>Really we're looking for curiosity,<br>energy and understanding that<br>the world is a changing place<br>and that you want to be<br>an active player in that.<br>The kinds of students<br>that might be interested<br>in approaching Victoria's<br>Bachelor of Design Innovation<br>programme would be students<br>that are leaving school,<br>but also people that might be<br>looking for a career change.<br>So if you're a student<br>that cares about people,<br>place, the planet, your community,<br>and making these all positive places<br>then the School of Design<br>Innovation is for you.<br>(upbeat music)<br>We have lecturers and<br>academic staff from all around<br>the world that specialise in<br>various aspects of design.<br>And we have a workroom with<br>cutting edge technology<br>that students want to come here<br>and experience from all over the world.<br>Graduating with a Bachelor<br>of Design Innovation,<br>positions you incredibly<br>well for really being<br>the arbiter of your own choices<br>in terms of where you<br>want to go in design.<br>There are a lot of design agencies<br>that you might imagine<br>yourself working at,<br>but there's also a lot of<br>freelancing and entrepreneurship<br>that goes along with the design skills<br>and communication skills that you gain<br>from this programme of study.<br>Half of the careers you could take<br>haven't even been invented yet.<br>The Bachelor of Design<br>Innovation is about arming our<br>students and graduates with<br>the skills and knowledge<br>that they need to participate in<br>the global conversation about innovation.<br>A Bachelor of Design<br>Innovation enables you<br>to confidently stand at the cutting edge,<br>to play a part as tech evolves,<br>as design evolves, as the world changes.<br>So many of the students that enrol<br>at the School of Design<br>Innovation care deeply<br>about people and place,<br>the planet and the people<br>in their communities.<br>So as a design school,<br>it's our responsibility to<br>really grow these<br>initiatives for the students,<br>with the students, and enable them<br>to be those agents of change.<br>Look around the room you're sitting in,<br>how much of it is designed.<br>Look at the systems that<br>you're using or a part of.<br>Look at the services you<br>use. Design as a discipline<br>is a changing and fluid space.<br>So with a Bachelor of Design Innovation,<br>you're able to respond to the<br>change that the discipline is<br>undergoing, but also the areas<br>that design can contribute to.<br>(upbeat music)<br>The Bachelor of Design Innovation is<br>a really broad programme where<br>you have a large body of<br>students that are interested<br>in a lot of different aspects<br>of design and broader.<br>We have students that are<br>focusing primarily on design,<br>but we also have a lot<br>of students from around<br>the whole of the Victoria campus<br>that might be mixing design<br>with other disciplines.<br>The programme of study<br>here is really flexible.<br>So you get to really choose<br>how you want to manage it.<br>Your programme of study in the<br>Bachelor of Design Innovation<br>is tailored by you, so<br>you have some core courses<br>that you will be taking<br>alongside everybody else<br>in your degree programme,<br>but you are available<br>to mix and match different courses<br>from all across the School<br>of Design Innovation.<br>You can choose your major<br>and then broadly take<br>and look at many other of the programmes,<br>taking courses from different programmes<br>to support what it is you're trying to do,<br>or you can really hunker down<br>and study completely within that programme.<br>Your programme of study in the<br>Bachelor of Design Innovation<br>can be unique to you only.<br>You know, we have some<br>core design principles<br>that we base our courses<br>on, but we're not here<br>to tell you how things should look,<br>or how things should feel<br>or how things should behave.<br>We're here to arm you<br>with analytical skills<br>and communication skills<br>and design skills primarily<br>that help you to form your own language.<br>Apart from the traditional skills<br>that you would learn at a design school,<br>that we might call hard skills,<br>where you're learning software, hardware<br>to work with technologies,<br>there's also an abundance of<br>soft skills that you'll learn.<br>Once you complete this degree,<br>you'll be better equipped<br>to work with people,<br>work within communities,<br>work with your clients<br>to really discover and<br>research what it is they need.<br>(upbeat music)<br>One of the great things about<br>studying in Wellington,<br>is we're not just the political capital,<br>we're also the creative capital.<br>The proximity that our students have<br>to leading industry professionals<br>in the fields of design<br>and innovation are really<br>incredible unique<br>opportunities for our students.<br>So being a part of that, right<br>at the heart of all of<br>that, is really exciting.<br>We are lucky here in Wellington to be<br>in a thriving innovation landscape.<br>The capital city of New Zealand is filled<br>with creative and innovative<br>and progressive people<br>doing really fascinating<br>things, and I think our students<br>really benefit from that environment.<br>You know, we are all here,<br>but we're engaging globally.<br>We have graduates that<br>are all over the world,<br>making change.<br>The design discipline is changing,<br>and so is the world<br>that it contributes to.<br>Graduating with a Bachelor<br>of Design Innovation<br>really enables you into career paths,<br>that beyond the ones who<br>possibly already know.<br>What excites me about<br>lecturing in the field of design<br>is that I'm able to talk<br>about the ways that design<br>has actually been a hotbed of innovation<br>for the whole world to draw from.<br>There's a common understanding<br>amongst designers that,<br>you know, you don't notice good design,<br>you only notice bad design<br>when something doesn't work,<br>when something jars.<br>So great design can help<br>make our lives seamless.<br>The biggest lesson<br>I've learned from design<br>is that humans aren't always right,<br>and we need your<br>curiosity, your questions,<br>your hard questions and your energy<br>to really move this world forward.<br>It doesn't really matter<br>what background you're from<br>or what you're interested in.<br>This programme of study<br>isn't just for people<br>that are interested in design.<br>Design is about the way we<br>process and shape information<br>and objects and the way we<br>interface with the world.<br>So if you want to use your<br>curiosity and your energy to be<br>an active agent of change,<br>come and study with us at the<br>Bachelor of Design Innovation.<br>We look forward to<br>welcoming you to Wellington<br>and to our school soon.<br>(upbeat music)</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
