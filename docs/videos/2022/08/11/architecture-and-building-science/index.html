There's some<br>really big challenges<br>and opportunities within that space.<br>How to make buildings affordable<br>so that we can have warm, dry,<br>safe housing for everybody<br>and how to make buildings<br>constructed better and quicker<br>so that that also impacts on<br>the deliverables of buildings.<br>(soft ambient music)<br>How do we live together?<br>It's seems so simple.<br>It's a basic question,<br>but it's an incredibly complicated answer<br>to which architecture<br>contributes enormously.<br>(soft ambient music)<br>So the degree is about the principles<br>of how does a building work,<br>starting from the ground up.<br>So what's the soil?<br>What's the foundations?<br>How do you keep water out of the walls?<br>How do you keep the building warm?<br>How do you stop sound<br>moving through the partition<br>so that if you're in a<br>high density apartment,<br>your neighbors party late<br>at night at two o'clock<br>in the morning,<br>isn't gonna stop you from going to sleep.<br>How do you stop fire spreading<br>from one building or tenancy to another?<br>So it's all about how<br>does a building perform<br>and how do we make that building better?<br>(soft ambient music)<br>I think the key thing<br>about what you learn<br>in this programme is that you're<br>mixing up three main threads<br>of knowledge.<br>The first one is probably technical.<br>So there's a whole lot of technical things<br>that you'll learn about the processes<br>that we go through and also<br>the how buildings work.<br>The second one is the<br>cultural context of work.<br>So, the ideas, the world of<br>ideas that shape architecture<br>and that architecture shapes.<br>And the third one is really<br>your own creative voice.<br>That's about you finding out<br>what kind of architecture<br>really pushes your buttons.<br>So there's a very strong theme<br>about sustainability that runs<br>through the courses that we<br>do and project management too.<br>So how do you actually<br>manage a project efficiently<br>so that you get the deliverables<br>on cost on time, managing the risks<br>so that everybody makes<br>a reasonable profit<br>at the end of the project.<br>I think the core of the<br>whole programme is studio.<br>That's really where your<br>creative voice gets nurtured.<br>And everyone is an individual in studio.<br>There's no universal rule<br>about how to do good<br>architectural projects.<br>That forms the bulk of your curriculum,<br>and then all specialist<br>subjects in history and theory<br>or technologies feed into that.<br>So a lot of the<br>things that students do,<br>is problem solving,<br>so different types of problem solving,<br>starting with simple case studies,<br>building up to much more<br>complex building types<br>and more complex case studies.<br>So a lot of it's very real<br>applied focus projects<br>because we live in our laboratory.<br>It's not like we have in the chemistry lab<br>where you have to go<br>in and work at a bench.<br>When you go home,<br>when you go to work,<br>when you go to the shops,<br>you're in your laboratory<br>and you can go around and look<br>and see and touch and feel<br>what it is that you're learning about.<br>And so the projects and the<br>problem solving that students do,<br>is very grounded in real life examples,<br>whether it be a school<br>or the house that they live in.<br>So in studio,<br>which really simulates live projects,<br>you'll start by thinking through the brief<br>and you'll work through site analysis<br>and those sorts of things often,<br>and through sketching, drawing, modeling,<br>those sorts of things,<br>you'll start to imagine this new building<br>and you'll work with technologies<br>that simulate things<br>like thermal performance<br>and sunlight access and<br>those sorts of issues,<br>right through to final<br>kind of finished models,<br>let's say digital and<br>physical models of a proposal.<br>It changes their life<br>because they then think<br>about the building that they live in,<br>work and play in differently.<br>So you can't go to the swimming pool<br>and not now see where the defects are<br>or where the surfaces are.<br>How can you do this better?<br>How can you make this more sustainable?<br>So it changes how you look at the world.<br>Well, you're never<br>gonna look at buildings,<br>towns or cities the same way ever again.<br>(soft ambient music)<br>Most of our graduates do go<br>into the construction industry<br>as practicing architects,<br>but some certainly go into<br>other creative disciplines.<br>Because Weta is here in Wellington,<br>it's a relatively easy transition to go<br>into the film industry and some do.<br>Lots of our technical,<br>our tools crossover with that industry.<br>But lots of others will go<br>into some of the other arts.<br>It could be fashion, could be pottery,<br>it could be painting even.<br>Some go into working for<br>the territorial authorities<br>like the councils.<br>They might be working in a<br>project management office<br>where they're helping with the deliverables,<br>the time, costs, management,<br>the resources, the plant, the labour<br>for getting a project together.<br>They might be working in<br>an architectural office<br>alongside other designers,<br>making the building performance<br>and the detail and work.<br>They might be working for a manufacturer<br>looking at how to make<br>an innovative materials.<br>But we've got graduates who<br>are doing all sorts of things<br>from making innovative walls<br>like the cross-frame system,<br>or they might be working for Kainga Ora<br>trying to build more<br>innovative social housing.<br>So the careers are really<br>varied where they can go.<br>You're gonna be part of an<br>industry where no two days<br>are ever the same.<br>You're not stuck at a desk,<br>you're out and about.<br>You're on construction sites,<br>you're meeting with clients,<br>you're looking at<br>innovation in different ways<br>to see how we can make<br>buildings that perform better.<br>You're part of a very fast moving career<br>where the problems are so huge.<br>You're never gonna be short of work.<br>There's a huge demand for<br>building science graduates.<br>(soft ambient music)<br>Now I've lived in some<br>amazing cities around the world,<br>Amsterdam, Rome, Sydney,<br>London, and they're all great.<br>But, Welly is better than all of them.<br>You know, it's so colourful.<br>It's so easy to walk around.<br>There's a constant<br>banging into other people<br>and other disciplines, other creatives.<br>And I really, really love it for that.<br>One it's really compact.<br>There's good accommodation, really good cafes<br>and a vibrant social life for students<br>close to the university.<br>But an important feature<br>is that a building science programme,<br>that's embedded in the<br>School of Architecture,<br>gives a really good<br>experience and grounding<br>in terms of the different disciplines<br>that you're exposed to while<br>you're doing your study.<br>So you're gonna be working<br>with architectural historians<br>in design theory,<br>as well as building science.<br>So it balances out the<br>experiences and the knowledge<br>that you get as a student.<br>But we also,<br>being very close and<br>connected to industry,<br>we have lots of guest lecturers come in<br>and there's opportunities for students<br>to get out and to see what<br>the practitioners are doing<br>so that you get lots<br>of real life case study<br>and practical knowledge too.<br>Well, the Wellington<br>School of Architecture<br>I think is incredibly special.<br>We have all these disciplines<br>under one roof and, more and more,<br>we need graduates and practitioners<br>who can slide easily across disciplines<br>and collaborate at the drop of a hat.<br>That is the way that we work.<br>It is massively in<br>demand around the world.<br>It makes us unique in New Zealand<br>and it makes us rare in the world.<br>So the technology that is coming about<br>is really significant.<br>It is really gonna change<br>how a building is put together.<br>100 years ago,<br>our buildings, towns and<br>cities were vastly different<br>to the buildings we're making today.<br>And in 100 years time,<br>all we can be sure about,<br>is that there'll be very different again.<br>And it's gonna be a fun ride to get there.<br>(soft ambient music)</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
