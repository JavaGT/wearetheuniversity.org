government launched<br>its report on orangutan<br>last year i think it was i was watching<br>the news and who was reading the report<br>shane walker what an awesome panel we've<br>got tonight these are our panelists<br>tonight the process is quite simple i'm<br>going to invite each of our<br>members to speak for about five minutes<br>on the topic of inequality<br>in an aotearoa<br>they may ruffle a few feathers they may<br>throw out a few challenges and at the<br>end of it all we're going to have a bit<br>of a panel discussion<br>and then we're gonna take your questions<br>because your questions your views are<br>important to us<br>so as you can see we have an awesome<br>panel we have a difficult topic<br>we're not here to look pretty we're not<br>here to sound nice we may ruffle a few<br>feathers we may take it to the edge and<br>why not<br>this is the winter symposium of otago<br>university so let's get the ball rolling<br>our first speaker tonight our usa<br>president<br>and thank you for that wonderful<br>introduction<br>um and malala to all our panelists as<br>well um as mentioned my name is<br>and i'm very grateful to have this<br>opportunity to give my views around<br>inequality and altera<br>and so in my thoughts and preparation uh<br>for this talk i was trying to think of<br>what's what's relative to me in regards<br>to inequality in aotearoa and i think<br>the best perspective<br>to give is is that of someone who i<br>guess it is an end user of a lot of the<br>policies and<br>and government initiatives and<br>strategies that come out but also<br>as someone in my current position um as<br>a president as someone doing a doctorate<br>as a mother of two who likes to think<br>she's well informed<br>um<br>who's<br>beyond that is someone that is a i guess<br>an advocate or<br>a translator um someone who's constantly<br>uh<br>trying to navigate bureaucracy so that<br>my family are able to partake in in the<br>forms that they receive at work and<br>income for for example so<br>for me when i think of the first time<br>that i came in contact with the system<br>especially um was like you said at the<br>age of five<br>it was in the moment of walking into<br>winds at the time which is msd i learned<br>that<br>me being able to translate<br>how food supplements were how the food<br>grant work and how accommodation<br>supplement work would be the determining<br>factor for my mother who didn't speak<br>very good english um<br>and the determining factor of whether we<br>ate that night<br>and so um<br>i think i also realized at the age of 11<br>that i had to find ways in which i can<br>translate their<br>i guess the heaviness of health and<br>medical words uh into tongan words so<br>that my mom was able to advocate for the<br>needs that we needed in health but also<br>be able to advocate that we're not in<br>any danger<br>and as we know the health system has had<br>its you know ups and downs and still<br>today we see it<br>um and so that is something i'm still<br>having to do to do today and just in<br>fact today i got a call from my mom<br>saying she went in to<br>get support around uh arthritis and<br>all they focused on was the weight that<br>she had gained the last time they seen<br>her and at that point you know having to<br>tell my mum that<br>you know that she doesn't have to worry<br>and their her needs are<br>are important you know you<br>you merely feel like you question why<br>you're in these positions of privilege<br>when um<br>you're a part of a system that you're<br>trying to help your family navigate but<br>also change<br>and so as you see these tears it is a<br>bit of frustration<br>but also the different hats you have to<br>wear and<br>i think what i'm trying to get across is<br>is how do we change that and do better<br>so that young people today do not have<br>to experience what i go through and it's<br>unfortunate that it's still what's<br>happening today<br>um<br>as i said here i often wonder if um<br>you know the things that we do<br>do is is is really going to make that<br>change and i'm hopeful i really am<br>hopeful and i don't want to to<br>disregard any work that people do in the<br>system and outside of the system but i<br>think it's really important to realize<br>that in amongst the work that we do and<br>the fight and change that we try to<br>bring<br>alongside that people are still trying<br>to access these supports and still<br>trying to navigate and figure out how<br>they have to arm themselves and be<br>resilient all the time just to get help<br>and so um<br>i guess the perspective i want to bring<br>to this corridor is the importance of<br>you know asking ourselves that you know<br>whether what we're doing is bigger than<br>ourselves and then whether what we're<br>doing is actually the best that we can<br>do<br>and so um there will be no uh academic<br>research coming from my mouth today i<br>can guarantee you that<br>but if anything i'm happy to be<br>vulnerable in this space uh give<br>perspective<br>but also uplift the voices of the<br>communities that i'm really fortunate to<br>to represent and also advocate for<br>and so i hope<br>and i do pray<br>that one day um<br>you know we don't replicate the system<br>that has become the status quo and so if<br>i think of inequality<br>i think of our students today who are<br>currently uh living off the bare minimum<br>from nation allowances who come to me to<br>my office and say<br>if i don't meet my rent i'm going to<br>drop out and these are third-year<br>students multi-pacific students who<br>have to send money back home or who have<br>to<br>find a side hustle that we know isn't<br>safe just to get by and it's like in<br>2022<br>that i saw the reality of the<br>discussions that i'm having to say to<br>students that you know there are<br>supports out there when you know<br>yourself<br>that you struggle to access them and so<br>um what are we doing what i want to<br>leave here as i finish is<br>do we really want uh young people in the<br>future if future future leaders in our<br>country to have to<br>constantly talk about resilience and<br>you know applaud people for being<br>resilient or do we want to find a way in<br>which our system means that they don't<br>have to<br>wear that all the time so that's all i<br>want to say thank you<br>thank you melissa you touched on a<br>number of things and yesterday while we<br>were talking you had us all in tears<br>yeah<br>it's personal isn't it very<br>very important it's very it's it's our<br>own whanau<br>we're dealing with what gives you hope<br>um actually what gives me hope but also<br>makes me sad something i said to shane<br>is that<br>my family's hope at the moment is me<br>becoming having a doctorate<br>and so<br>as much as it's like what that's what<br>your family's hope is if that's what i<br>can do<br>to give them hope<br>in their lives right now then i will do<br>that and so um at the same time i have a<br>mother who<br>raised children on her own<br>uh who works<br>all these hours to help me get through<br>my study um tell me that and amongst the<br>opportunities that i have you know<br>you've always got to carry people with<br>you and so that's my hope<br>um today yeah tell them<br>my law thank you for sharing<br>one thing one word that melissa used and<br>i'd like everyone out there to to think<br>about marissa use the word privilege<br>privilege think about that moving along<br>professor richie over to you yorotato<br>thank you esteem chair um and for the<br>introduction thank you as well um i<br>should correct and say i formally was um<br>chief science advisor<br>to ministry of social development and<br>its um knowledge role job of a<br>spectacular person professor tracy<br>mcintosh<br>melissa's um kodi raw<br>is um<br>it's compelling<br>uh because it's authentic<br>it's not wrapped up in weasel words<br>uric speak<br>or any<br>captured by any form of sophistry<br>which is i think what drives most of us<br>nuts especially those that have been<br>working in this area trying to<br>um lean into it and do something helpful<br>for in my case over a quarter of a<br>century<br>but i'm going to give you a very quick<br>overview of<br>a moderately hopeful<br>scenario<br>and i'm speaking more directly to<br>researchers than to<br>any other group because the story starts<br>with research and in particular research<br>we did in the early 2000s from the<br>dunedin study<br>that showed that if you are<br>born into socio-economic disadvantage<br>and remain there for the whole of your<br>child and by that i'm talking about up<br>to the age of 15 years<br>the long-term consequences for physical<br>health and mental wellbeing<br>are<br>potent<br>and detrimental<br>and interestingly up until that point no<br>one had conclusively shown<br>whether if you grow out of poverty into<br>the upper echelons of the socio-economic<br>spectrum by adulthood whether that would<br>undo<br>or mitigate<br>the initial and early impact of<br>childhood poverty so this paper that we<br>we published in 2002 did exactly that<br>and showed unequivocally that what<br>happens in childhood has long lasting<br>echoes down through the life force and<br>the echoes are all adverse when poverty<br>is a classic distal as opposed to<br>proximal or near<br>risk factor for a whole range of bad<br>outcomes<br>uh this<br>initial paper was part of the reason<br>i along with my um colleague and friend<br>philippe harden chapman were asked to be<br>part of a group<br>and i brought this along because i had<br>to read it the other day to remember<br>what was in it<br>russell wills<br>instigated report on<br>solutions to child poverty<br>in new zealand evidence for action<br>no longer evidence for talking talking<br>talking and nice reports evidence for<br>action now<br>if you look at this you can see that the<br>first three points of 78 take away<br>messages<br>there are quite a resemblance to the<br>content of the<br>child property reduction act<br>in fact the then opposition member in a<br>private member's bill i believe jacinda<br>ardern<br>took from this report<br>much of the core<br>message<br>related to how one could tackle this<br>wicked problem<br>wicked is now i think would code for<br>don't go there because it's too tough<br>now this was an interesting moment in<br>time where the research was it was<br>brought together<br>a minister from the opposition thought i<br>liked the look of that<br>and it led subsequently once boss labour<br>were in power to some significant<br>legends of change<br>and also fed into the production of the<br>child and youth wellbeing report<br>so you saw a relationship it's never<br>linear by the way research doesn't come<br>out and all of a sudden the government<br>changes because politics always trumps<br>research<br>but what we saw was a flow of<br>information through different<br>parts of society to the stage where it<br>ended up being discussed in our<br>parliament and ended up being debated<br>and getting cross-party support for the<br>key initiatives that have flowed from<br>this<br>early work such that poverty has to be<br>reported on<br>five different ways<br>every year and there are three year<br>targets and there's a ten year or 9 year<br>target<br>so far the data suggests that<br>things are moving in the right direction<br>not fast enough though<br>never is fast enough<br>every day a child spends in poverty is a<br>it's unconscionable that we sit around<br>waiting for things to happen<br>and i think there's enormous frustration<br>because these gaps or inequalities have<br>been there forever it seems and we know<br>the<br>rationale and the story behind it we now<br>need to grip it up as i say in um<br>officials land in wellington<br>and shake it so we can make some real<br>changes remember that they said evidence<br>for action<br>best<br>efforts are being made by many<br>and i cast no aspersions on<br>all those efforts but it has to be<br>ratcheted up<br>because we still have<br>scandalous high rates of child poverty<br>we cannot sit by and tolerate that<br>that's not for someone else to take care<br>of we all need to chip in<br>and<br>this we do excuse me<br>things will not manifestly change<br>that i guess is my bottom line we can<br>through research and other things get to<br>get to a certain point but it needs to<br>go much further and i know my<br>colleagues on the panel are going to<br>talk about what that might look like so<br>thank you for listening and i look<br>forward to further discussion after our<br>presentations<br>thank you thank you richard<br>you mentioned<br>25 years ago i was thinking 25 years ago<br>my parents were alive now i'm here 25<br>years into the future my grandchildren<br>will be in their 40s and i'm left with a<br>question<br>is inequality intergenerational now<br>yes and that's the double whammy of<br>course<br>so if you grow up in poverty you learn<br>the rules about poverty which is don't<br>expect too much<br>and that maybe you're not as good as<br>someone else and you don't have the<br>resources to access opportunity to<br>improve yourself and that becomes<br>a part of the family history and<br>understanding of how the world works and<br>if i was in that boat<br>i'd be pretty pissed off<br>and i'd be pretty angry and so the<br>people that<br>are in that situation currently have<br>every right to voice their displeasure<br>and disappointment<br>and they should not be marginalized in<br>terms of political ideology as being<br>their own<br>benefits as being lazy they're not they<br>want to get out there and participate in<br>society<br>and sadly and i suppose this will be<br>touched on for sure uh by shane and<br>others<br>it's not an equal playing field so<br>proportionally more maori and pacifica<br>are enduring poverty and all its<br>unpleasantness than pakiha and that<br>hasn't changed either yet we've<br>recognized that discrepancy for 30 plus<br>years as well there's a number of<br>real challenges that we are moving in<br>the right direction about but we need to<br>speed it up<br>was it ever discussed about having<br>a treaty clause in the poverty reduction<br>act<br>it was discussed<br>but it wasn't discussed as it is<br>discussed today<br>i think that the good news in the last<br>10 years the authority is now talked<br>about um with insight<br>and understanding of the implications of<br>what went on before and what that tells<br>us about where we should go and how we<br>should go forward ten years ago philippa<br>you can correct me if i'm wrong we<br>understood that this was important<br>the uh ethos or the the values that sat<br>behind that treaty are essential for the<br>future of terror in new zealand<br>um but it wouldn't i don't think it<br>um headed its front and center as you<br>would see now in most documents<br>is that about right this is really<br>really great you know this is unscripted<br>conversation that is happening thank you<br>richie<br>privilege intergenerational i'm looking<br>forward to what you have to say helen<br>thank you so much wayne<br>so my research focuses on the gap<br>between ceo and worker pay levels and i<br>now have more than 20 years of data and<br>what we see from that is this<br>growing gap between people who are very<br>highly paid and the lower paid workers<br>in the organization measured by mean and<br>by median are using the household labor<br>force uh survey data and that data is<br>quite generous it's<br>estimated that in 2022 an individual was<br>getting uh 35 dollars per hour at the<br>mean level and 30 dollars per hour<br>the median level so if we think of that<br>relative to<br>the minimum wage at the moment in new<br>zealand which is 2120<br>if i was to make my ratios relative to<br>the minimum wage they would be even<br>larger than they are so at the mean<br>level it suggests<br>median pay levels in new zealand<br>relative to ceos on lists of companies<br>set between 15 and 18 times<br>so those individuals at the highest<br>level of the organization are earning<br>considerably more and that's grown by<br>243 percent over that time period<br>relative to income<br>to workers that's only grown at about<br>100 so we're talking about significant<br>changes in pay over time growing at much<br>higher rates if i think about living on<br>minimum income<br>21.20 now is 848 dollars a week that's<br>pre-tax<br>so even if we don't take the tax off or<br>adjust the kiwisaver paying rent paying<br>electricity buying food if you've got<br>school-aged children having enough money<br>to buy petrol or to buy a bus to get to<br>get your children to school every day<br>it's really really hard and that doesn't<br>include clothing or additional costs<br>that might come through medical<br>uncertainty or potentially a car failure<br>which might drive someone to have to<br>borrow at high costs of borrowing<br>because they can't borrow money directly<br>from the bank so it's<br>a very difficult cycle to break<br>in addition our research shows that it<br>doesn't stop when you retire some people<br>think when you get the pension life<br>potential will be easier<br>that has an adequacy rate measured<br>through the oecd of approximately 40<br>which means you're achieving 40 of what<br>you would have achieved while working<br>and often people retire with debt still<br>paying mortgages or find out that they<br>have to work much longer after the 65<br>year old retirement age in new zealand<br>so all of these are contributing<br>severely to child poverty because these<br>households are impacted daily<br>through the income that comes<br>from those individuals working at home<br>um<br>i picked up from what you were saying<br>breaking the cycles of inequality one<br>minute if you were the minister of<br>finance how would you break those cycles<br>of inequality thank you wayne so i think<br>it's really really important that we<br>look at what's happening in our low<br>decile schools<br>i think one way to address this poverty<br>cycle is to have children going to<br>school and staying at school until year<br>13 with the option of going into<br>tertiary or additional training so that<br>they end up having the opportunity of<br>choice where they work what they do<br>and earning enough money that they<br>aren't living constantly in poverty when<br>you have choice you have dignity<br>thank you alan so privilege<br>intergenerational cycles of inequality<br>over to you shane<br>ah<br>um<br>and<br>friends who have turned up for this<br>conversation<br>my connection<br>to the kaupapa of<br>inequality<br>really goes back to<br>my wife and i and actually she should be<br>sitting here<br>because because she<br>has far more of a claim to the hard<br>yards that were done when we did this<br>mahi<br>but we fostered and fangirled 192 young<br>people over 12 years<br>and<br>one of the disturbing things<br>and<br>it was often often<br>you know people would immediately say<br>you know the parents<br>um they'd use this term kind of bad<br>parents and all that kind of thing but<br>often<br>young people were coming to us<br>because of um<br>really neglect and deprivation<br>and one of the things that we quickly<br>came to was<br>not to think of parents badly because we<br>had their children in care and to really<br>work hard about thinking about them<br>differently<br>because socially<br>they were already mistreated badly<br>and<br>you know when pua tiatatu came out the<br>report on the department of social<br>welfare that challenged its racism and<br>the subsequent 1989 cypnef act<br>the numbers of maori children that were<br>in care dropped to the lowest numbers<br>they've ever been<br>in the following three years<br>but quickly after that<br>what i saw as an<br>insidious evil<br>the public sector<br>and<br>and whatever department you were in you<br>started to get the same kind of chief<br>executives with the same kind of<br>imperatives<br>and<br>and i remember the first time i heard a<br>government department called a business<br>or a company<br>and at the time i let it slide<br>but today if i hear it<br>i let people know<br>that they're not a business that<br>actually they're a public service that i<br>i pay taxes for and i want the best<br>for young people and<br>one of the things that's very clear from<br>the research of the likes of my<br>colleague emily cadell<br>and the research that her and len cook<br>put in<br>at the waitangi tribunal inquiry into<br>orangutaki last year<br>was the clear links between<br>deprivation<br>ethnicity<br>and intervention by the state now you<br>can repeat<br>those same stats<br>in a number of other places<br>and i couldn't believe that<br>you know kind of 30 years later we're<br>making the same mistake again and so<br>when i started to look at the numbers of<br>maori children who were in care<br>it became very clear to me that based on<br>a safety risk approach<br>they were<br>removing children and i'll use this term<br>badly in in a clumsy way but i mean to<br>to try and fix them<br>in a whole number of different ways and<br>and we had record numbers of maori<br>children in care<br>and<br>the problem was<br>they are coming back home to a home near<br>you they come back to our communities<br>and it was as if<br>those those tamariki or those rangatahi<br>were the primary client of a number of<br>organizations<br>and their whanau were the secondary<br>client in other words they were an<br>appendage in other words they were<br>saying we can't afford to work with the<br>parents or anyone else we'll just<br>concentrate our money our putiya on this<br>individual hence record numbers of<br>children and care but also<br>rampant<br>approaches to safety and risk<br>and<br>i<br>i my analogy for this is something you'd<br>see at the end of a um<br>a mafia movie and it's not a very nice<br>one<br>but i think and i really believe this<br>about the public service<br>that in a number of places<br>several different ministries<br>and several different pieces of<br>legislation<br>they need<br>a um<br>a treaty of waitangi clause<br>that includes things like<br>the mana of all of our children not just<br>maori<br>you know but the public finance act<br>should have that in it the poverty<br>reduction act should have a treaty<br>clause in it and i have a whole number<br>of other acts where i think we should<br>have it as well<br>um<br>because<br>if you if we're going to continue to<br>think<br>that the corporatization of the public<br>sector is a good idea<br>then all we're saying to poor people<br>and those who<br>who suffer the disempowerment<br>and the daily pain<br>that goes with this all we're saying to<br>them<br>is um<br>it's nothing personal it's just business<br>and i'm sick of thinking like that and i<br>want to work with people who think<br>differently<br>and probably<br>what really sparked me up was during<br>covert<br>especially when i saw the kopapa maori<br>ngos<br>and<br>the eewee<br>raw poo like takaika<br>and ngos like tahoe water<br>during covert<br>they they just went nuts<br>they<br>risked their own health they got ride in<br>amongst whanau if you go to the<br>facilities of both of those<br>organizations now<br>their workers when they go to homes<br>they take kai there's a hall there where<br>you play basketball that's full of kai<br>because<br>this is how they're dealing with poverty<br>now the fact that they're doing<br>something about it<br>is good but it's still not dealing with<br>the structural cause of it<br>thirty thousand empty homes in auckland<br>as a you know as a as a consequence of<br>the white line test and a number of<br>i kind of think how can we have thirty<br>thousand empty homes<br>when children and whanau are sleeping in<br>cars<br>700 a week for a three-bedroom home<br>how do we let that happen<br>a duopoly controlling supermarkets<br>you know<br>supermarket staff are wanting to wear<br>body cams<br>and<br>everyone is thinking that's because it's<br>covered i think it's because people are<br>sick and tired of what they have to<br>leave in that shop and what they can't<br>afford to take home<br>because when i go shopping now and i<br>have a huge capacity<br>in terms of what i what i can purchase<br>in a shop but i cannot imagine what it<br>is like for a mother with a child who<br>it's not personal it's just business<br>thank you that's what i say well that<br>you<br>packed a lot into that<br>190 plus children your your you and your<br>wife have<br>have brought up over the years and and<br>reading all your bios it shows to me<br>that you all have<br>life experience when it comes to this<br>and there's no substitute for life<br>experience and<br>shane you mentioned the treaty of<br>waitangi is co-governance the answer or<br>wrong answer<br>i look i um<br>i i think it is i think if we're going<br>to have<br>an honest conversation<br>in dealing<br>with housing and dealing with employment<br>and dealing with income<br>it starts on the basis of to treat your<br>waitangi<br>the health authority is the first cab<br>off the rank i think there is<br>opportunity for a number of others<br>especially as we are capacity building<br>in other sectors<br>i'd like to point out te triti or<br>waitangi invites everyone who was in<br>aotearoa<br>onto the soil<br>and says<br>be part of our whenua<br>and<br>rather than seeing it as being divisive<br>or threatening<br>i think it is one of the unique things<br>that divides us worldwide<br>when when my daughter went to live in<br>germany i was worried that i would lose<br>her heart<br>to being european and that i would never<br>get her back to ulti at all<br>but one of the things that<br>really amazed me<br>was<br>the things that<br>her friends in germany wanted to know<br>about being maori<br>and so she came home from germany<br>utterly convinced about her place in<br>altea<br>but also what she had to contribute to<br>this country<br>being modding and i think<br>for me that's part of i think our<br>overall response<br>and this talk about inequality<br>when we go to the ballot box you know i<br>don't want to vote<br>for the same old rubbish<br>i'm sick of it<br>i'm sick of<br>human beings being turned into cost<br>centers<br>you know when when a<br>a child turns up at auranga tamariki<br>it shouldn't be<br>an issue of<br>what this could cost because good child<br>protection work is costly it's not cheap<br>building relationships costs money you<br>have to work hard at it<br>and so<br>a broad question i would ask across all<br>of these ministries is how do we uphold<br>the mana of all children and i think to<br>treaty is a good starting point for that<br>conversation killed us<br>and i'll shut up because philippa's got<br>to get going<br>the<br>word privilege intergenerational<br>cycle<br>the treaty of whitehall<br>for this discussion tonight and i'm so<br>looking forward to what you have to say<br>forever<br>um<br>so it is a it's a real pleasure to be<br>with you all i've been writing i took<br>action from your uh uh<br>speak ritchie um uh you're the<br>translator melissa and i'm a translator<br>in a different way your ability to move<br>between a whole lot of people um you're<br>one about stressing the growth and<br>inequalities in terms of income<br>and and when you're kind of um<br>the breadth and the there's this fungi<br>that you're doing and the and the the<br>recognition of the system and how we've<br>got to improve that and the central<br>place of thirty so i'm gonna pick up<br>some of that um particularly in relation<br>to housing<br>um because having a home is a central<br>aspect of people's lives and and the<br>cornerstone basically of trust in<br>society and its institutions you can't<br>you don't trust people um on where i<br>walk to work at scott excuse the<br>language it says um uh what should i do<br>for anyone what the has anyone ever<br>done for me you know so if people feel<br>like that excuse me<br>um then they're not going to be kind of<br>actually um<br>contributing so i think a safe warm<br>secure affordable house in a community<br>that's inclusive um is central to<br>people's health and well-being<br>but i want to briefly talk about the<br>problem first which we're very familiar<br>with because housing is the issue i<br>think for the election and for our<br>society<br>um sadly since 1991 the rates of<br>ownership have really declined and there<br>are some shocking ethnic inequalities<br>so in in 2018 when the last census was<br>um two only two-thirds of um new<br>zealanders i lived in a home that they<br>owned um it's higher proportion for<br>pakiha it's 70<br>it's under half for maori and it's even<br>lower it's low 30s for pacifica<br>so that's<br>means that<br>some people are secure in their housing<br>and some people aren't so that's the<br>structural um<br>insecurity and we've just when my<br>colleagues finished<br>um um<br>well partway through a project on<br>eviction and how destabilizing that is<br>for families having to move out of<br>community and children moving around and<br>the more times that they move one of<br>them very good doctorate done by kim<br>nathan the more likely they are<br>to have behavioral and social problems<br>so we found that too<br>there are now 27 000 people on the<br>ministry of social development waiting<br>list<br>so it's been going up like this just<br>slowed very recently that's 27 000<br>people who can't afford private rental<br>and are living in cars or crowding with<br>relatives i've worked with colleagues<br>on a severe housing deprivation and<br>found that there are close to 4 000<br>people who are not in shelter so they're<br>in traditional sense homeless<br>about 8 000 people were in temporary<br>accommodation the emergency housing the<br>the motels<br>30 000 people were in severely crowded<br>houses and we know from<br>if you can't afford<br>a rent the way to make it a bit cheaper<br>is get more people into the house and<br>it's a it's a it's an economic<br>um choice in most the time not a not a<br>cultural court<br>um choice because everybody likes<br>privacy and being able to talk to people<br>with lots of other people around and we<br>did a study looking at<br>things that you need in your house like<br>electricity<br>there are sixty thousand households who<br>are either um and severe deprivation<br>either lacking electricity potable water<br>um shocking because and particularly in<br>rural areas so the problem there's too<br>many people living in poor quality<br>houses in new zealand there are too few<br>houses according to kiwi bank actually<br>they've been recently the the the<br>position is<br>um<br>improving i know that a year ago it was<br>57 000 houses short now we think there's<br>about 23 000 houses short and this is<br>due to the building um in the private<br>sector about and and kainga which i have<br>the privilege i was pointed to um by the<br>government um<br>so i'm part of this largest building<br>exercise that's been since the after the<br>second world war<br>and the idea is to get more affordable<br>homes both to rent and to buy and secure<br>ones not when you're when you're kicked<br>out<br>so um i briefly talked just about um the<br>research group that i set up with my<br>colleagues that's hiking oranga the<br>housing and health research program and<br>we decided we weren't just going to<br>describe inequality and how it was<br>growing we were going to look at the<br>things that would make a difference so<br>we did very robust studies about<br>retrofitting insulation to houses<br>ventilations heating<br>stopping<br>injuries where people fall in their<br>houses making it easier for disabled<br>people to get into their houses and this<br>is linked to the whi chair committee<br>that<br>worked out the housing and health<br>guidelines and we're now linked through<br>to the who and we know that that makes a<br>big difference to a number of<br>hospitalizations there how children do<br>in school how many days they miss off<br>school and my colleague um<br>professor neville pearce has been doing<br>that um actually monetizing all those um<br>differences<br>so um the worst thing of course is<br>private rental housing in new zealand<br>and um this<br>30 000 empty homes are basically because<br>whoever owns them is waiting around for<br>capital gains and they don't care about<br>the rent in fact rent in wealthy areas<br>is usually cheaper than in poorer areas<br>because it's their it's not the rent<br>that's going to make them wealthy it's<br>going to be the capital gains<br>so we we did a lot of work we did a set<br>up a rental warranty fitness which<br>paved the way for the healthy home<br>standards and i guess that's the thing i<br>feel proudest about really so if you're<br>in a flat<br>in in<br>in dunedin um that basically by the<br>middle of next year whether the<br>university owns it um kangaroo owns it<br>the local community the presbyterian<br>church they have to have<br>it has to have<br>high level of insulation it has to have<br>ventilation and it has to have heating<br>so that it can be heated to 18 degrees<br>so that's a big change um from<br>flats that some people crashed<br>and in cairo that<br>and to pick up your trends i was given<br>the opportunity to take those research<br>results which after all were paid by the<br>taxpayers the work that we did and<br>actually say this is how it can make the<br>houses better and that's very very<br>exciting so that's linking together um i<br>must stop i'm going like that<br>it links the links between the<br>university and the bodies like<br>which is homes and communities and<br>that's been set up not one of those<br>business making places i mean we have to<br>be<br>flying i mean we we have to<br>make sure that everything adds up over a<br>long period but we've been giving given<br>funding to raise bonds<br>well-being green bonds so they have<br>enough money to keep it going so there's<br>not a boom and bust<br>and um this year we've built um 1800<br>houses and there's um since kangaroo was<br>set up in<br>2009 we sought five and a half thousand<br>houses so it's a very very exciting<br>because there are sixty eight thousand<br>of those homes we we house about<br>380<br>um thousand people and so your point<br>about was is very similar where<br>people grumble like they feel that<br>somebody's misbehaving next door but the<br>idea is that we help people to sustain<br>tenancies in the communities which we<br>give lots of resources to make sure<br>there's parks there increasingly<br>cycleways and walkways so<br>it's a very exciting space for me to be<br>in and<br>so i<br>think things are difficult and i really<br>really um<br>realize that they're much more difficult<br>um for maori and pacifica but things are<br>definitely changing and for the better<br>and i'm personally working with kangora<br>whether we're helping to build<br>papakaianga housing and onenoid mata and<br>that's on mri reserve land and it's like<br>very exciting and it's a co-governance<br>thing with the with the actually in this<br>case an urban authority it's very<br>exciting so i'm<br>fizzing with it all<br>thank you thank you can i i said it you<br>know based construction company that<br>only had to have an roi of three percent<br>yeah imagine what they could do to the<br>market<br>murray companies are prioritized in<br>tangora and apprenticeships and stuff<br>like that<br>i said at the very beginning that we've<br>got an awesome panel and we have some of<br>the country's best thinkers on our panel<br>tonight and i think they've just proven<br>this i'm going to say to the panel thank<br>you very much grab a drink of water have<br>a one minute break and we've got<br>questions coming in and we're going to<br>start engaging with our audience and the<br>questions they they have<br>are asking<br>and this first question we're not going<br>to take because it says<br>wrong one guys hey don't go to sky tv<br>now okay they<br>lose all know the answer to that the<br>answer is bring back buck okay<br>so our first question and i'm gonna pose<br>this to the whole panel if anybody would<br>like to uh answer this question<br>how can we persuade the top 10 percent<br>of new zealanders who own nearly 60 of<br>new zealand's wealth<br>to filter or distribute that wealth to<br>the bottom 50 percent<br>who own only 2 percent of new zealand's<br>wealth would anybody like to give that<br>one ago i'll open by saying okay thank<br>you shane i've come across<br>some amazing<br>philanthropy<br>from um different sectors<br>and i'm the chair of voice<br>and the um<br>the larger organizations and individuals<br>that support<br>that mahi<br>magnificent<br>but that's by relationship and it's one<br>relationship at a time<br>and<br>for me the movement of wealth to that<br>group<br>has been significant<br>in the last 20 years<br>and i think about how we can move it<br>back<br>i don't think we can rely on the market<br>to mitigate this<br>i do think we have to use some levers<br>in our country but also<br>appeal to<br>those people on the basis of<br>and i've decided to call the market<br>those who have capital and i think about<br>it now as being people<br>and<br>and also<br>this kind of mantra that we've almost<br>got from it that greed is good well it's<br>not<br>you know the things that it's doing in<br>our nation and i don't think<br>the 10 percent<br>that owns percent of altitude<br>want to leave a legacy of greed<br>i think they want to leave a legacy<br>of building a better country that their<br>mark on this country would be for those<br>things<br>anybody else want to give that<br>i'm happy to go um<br>and<br>i'll probably say something a little<br>weird for some a pointy headed academic<br>like me<br>um<br>but a really obvious thing to do is to<br>introduce a capital gains tax<br>now this is a political football<br>but<br>a proper one a hard one<br>no escape things there's some forms of<br>it and the the bottom line on that is<br>not the politicians that are at fault<br>they make the decision so in that sense<br>they are but what they're trying to the<br>politics of new zealand as the middle<br>politics of the middle ground<br>and because it's politically<br>unacceptable so no political parties<br>prepared to go down that path<br>the middle ground has to sit<br>it has to agree upon set up some new<br>rules and all lean into it and let<br>politicians know so it becomes something<br>that goes back onto the table<br>and it's not a radical proposition most<br>every other jurisdiction like similar to<br>new zealand um it's a no-brainer yeah<br>we're this outlier<br>and of course<br>some of this distortion<br>of the<br>money<br>distribution<br>um maybe a lot of it is driven by this<br>idea that you invest in bricks and<br>mortar<br>and that's how wealth grows forget<br>income how wealth grows and that's<br>what's the guy's name the kitty people<br>um<br>his book basically said for most of<br>human history that's been the way it's<br>been an aberrative<br>aberration point in the first part of<br>the last century but we're now going<br>back to that well you don't<br>you should not let<br>those forces<br>overrun you where you can push back and<br>there are simple levers that can be<br>pulled they will have an effect<br>it won't solve the problem overnight and<br>that's naive but it will make a<br>difference<br>um so why are we holding back on that um<br>just on that i mean i agree about a<br>wealth tax and pakitti says actually<br>that most investment all around the<br>world because there's been housing<br>bubbles in most of the western countries<br>has been in buildings not on land<br>anymore and that's the largest asset<br>people own and somebody talked about the<br>intergenerational stuff that's why the<br>privilege gets passed along and your<br>grandparents and your parents haven't<br>owned a house you are not going to have<br>enough money to buy a house so i think<br>the wealth tax is very important and<br>piquetty in his book the capital really<br>makes the point that unless the<br>government intervenes there might be<br>very good people doing charity but it's<br>a drop in the bucket really compared to<br>what is needed absolutely and exactly so<br>the way that question was posed was<br>interesting how do we persuade<br>you don't yeah that requires goodwill<br>and<br>motivation from both sides you make it a<br>requirement yeah that's what legislation<br>is for but that's for the greater good<br>isn't there an argument that says that<br>there's too much government in our lives<br>well who's argument yeah who's saying<br>that<br>i'm sorry but these who are not in<br>government at the moment<br>that argument generally have capital<br>yeah because<br>don't want to redistribute it and you<br>and your point that you made before<br>about 30 000 what they call ghost houses<br>nobody in them<br>if we were in barcelona or in spain they<br>tax them and they do also in england too<br>because you provide these sort of<br>deserts you know as with an island all<br>these big booming houses and they're all<br>empty and then they're vandalized and so<br>i think we should<br>you know we could get some good examples<br>from other parts in the odc and tax<br>people who choose to leave their houses<br>empty for a huge amount of time<br>let oppose this question to helen<br>are there any countries we can look to<br>and learn from as good examples of doing<br>things right to solve some of these<br>problems<br>and certainly there are if you look in<br>the<br>practice around the scandinavian<br>countries norway and sweden actually<br>shane and i were talking about this the<br>other day you know good healthcare good<br>social<br>systems in place to ensure that people<br>have good places to live safe clean warm<br>places to live number one priority food<br>to eat on a regular basis<br>forms of employment that give them<br>adequate income to live not large levels<br>of income necessarily but are certainly<br>a social system that looks after<br>everybody equally so you don't see these<br>huge divides between people who are<br>really really struggling and those who<br>are just making ends meet and can i just<br>think that the issue of debt which<br>plagues one reason why people can't get<br>into a house because they've got debt<br>they can't stop paying a mortgage but if<br>you're in finland and you give a<br>speeding fine it's 10 times<br>the amount of money and the and the cop<br>looks up honestly you can see what your<br>your um salary is and if you're a<br>multi-millionaire you pay<br>hundreds of thousands in a five yeah i<br>think the record in finland is two<br>hundred thousand years<br>a guy got a speeding ticket yeah yeah i<br>i got that amount for the other day<br>melissa<br>quite often the question like this what<br>can we learn from other countries we<br>immediately run off to europe and we<br>totally ignore the pacific<br>what can we learn from the<br>pacific i definitely think what we can<br>learn from the pacific is um<br>for me i totally think it's wrapping<br>ourselves around tau mali and te karmari<br>because in the pacific like samoa they<br>do have a matai system alongside the<br>government system and not that i'm<br>saying that there has been a way but<br>what i'm saying is there is a central<br>point in which we base our practices our<br>values regardless of your cultural<br>religious background there is a certain<br>point in which we come together and we<br>sort of base the way in which we<br>interact and<br>if anything there's this massive uh<br>method but there's a big emphasis on<br>when you make a decision you think about<br>how it affects you the person next to<br>you the people around you<br>and then you think about who's left out<br>in their conversation and then who is<br>going to<br>um you know what are the consequences of<br>those who weren't a part of that<br>discussion and so i'm not saying it<br>doesn't happen here but<br>in terms of normalizing that type of<br>thinking and mentality i think is<br>something that we could look to for the<br>pacific and not to say you know studying<br>my doctor in the pacific region we've<br>got some things we need to work on but<br>that is usually some of the values that<br>i'm not anti-business or anti-capitalism<br>in any way shape or form<br>um<br>i'm i'm kaita who<br>and i would consider us to be<br>one of the<br>best collective capitalists<br>corporates in the country and we are but<br>the benefits<br>are for a broad group of people<br>the benefits<br>of the investments that that tribe makes<br>comes back to 33 or 34 000 people<br>now<br>i guess what i'm after when you start to<br>to look at these issues<br>is more distributive justice<br>because<br>for me when i think about child<br>protection<br>and the fact that<br>poor people<br>generally add on being maori or pacifica<br>and you're six times more likely to end<br>up with a child in care<br>or to come to notice or<br>or 18 times more likely in the worst<br>deprivation deciles<br>to<br>have abuse substantiated when you put<br>those things together<br>um<br>we have to start dealing with<br>those kind of things that are viewed as<br>wicked problems as richie has said<br>in far broader ways and so<br>you know when when if you get it down to<br>a practice level when a social worker or<br>a teacher or any other human service<br>worker is there and they're having to<br>deal with kind of the behavior<br>behavioral issues of a child or an adult<br>um<br>you can't<br>you can't disregard housing<br>you can't disregard food<br>you can't disregard energy you can't<br>disregard clothes<br>they are all parts of the way that we<br>feel fully human<br>and so<br>i am<br>i've been lucky enough to be teaching up<br>in norway since 2007<br>and i love teaching up there and i have<br>a whanau up there that<br>that just such a wonderful place to be<br>but<br>one of the<br>and<br>like other parts of scandinavia<br>they operate on the basis that in in um<br>companies and in some government<br>departments the ce can't earn more than<br>10 times what the the lowest paid worker<br>earns yeah i love that<br>you know i just think japan too is like<br>that you know like<br>a country that thinks like that i think<br>is a fairer country and i think by<br>nature<br>um<br>the people of alteora we think we like<br>to give people a fair go but<br>if we really look at it honestly at the<br>moment we're not giving the poor a fair<br>go and we're not giving particular<br>sections of society a fair go and we<br>have to have<br>you know honest and robust conversations<br>about it<br>great great answer you know individual<br>wealth versus<br>collective wealth yeah great now i'm<br>going to pose this question to you too<br>which was it's about issues and<br>recommendations and whatnot<br>hey great<br>questions people keep them rolling in<br>why is it that groups are formed to help<br>solve these issues recommendations are<br>made but those recommendations are never<br>really<br>they never made a reality where does the<br>issue lie richie so what did you say<br>say what you said um do you remember<br>what you said yesterday about them about<br>implementation oh yeah so i was going to<br>go there oh my god what did i say<br>yesterday<br>yes so and this is often the case i can<br>have great research great policy<br>developed from research<br>and then basically there's a failure to<br>implement<br>properly<br>so<br>more often what you see in<br>in<br>poor ideas<br>implemented halfway okay<br>when the day over great ideas that are<br>poorly implemented<br>so the implementation is this is the<br>is the mysterious black box of social<br>policy why can't we take these good<br>ideas and roll them out and make them<br>stick in real people's lives<br>there's a whole bunch of<br>answers probably none of which is<br>sufficient unto itself but you've got<br>the<br>bizarrely siloed<br>ministerial set up where every silo is<br>incentivized to do well against its<br>other silos when the best approach is<br>honestly cross-sectoral<br>and that's been known and obvious for a<br>long time but<br>when i was a science advisor i asked<br>everyone i met including ministers after<br>about a year in the job could they point<br>me in the direction of a single example<br>of cross sector or cooperation that was<br>sustainable<br>not it was set up and ran for a bit that<br>was sustainable because that's the way<br>we need to to go<br>and i'm still waiting for an answer<br>there's no examples of the success so<br>what is that about what's the perverse<br>incentivization of people in their silos<br>to hit their kpis to grab as much<br>resource rather than share<br>and you know that's a core challenge and<br>we need to have an honest more honest<br>open discussion about how that works we<br>need to have public servants<br>who call out these perverse<br>incentives<br>and speak to the government of the day<br>in a without fear of favor approach now<br>apparently that was<br>dear when i was<br>knee-high to a grasshopper 30-40 years<br>ago that was the way things happened in<br>new zealand but somehow there's been a<br>politicization<br>and a dampening or a dilution of the<br>public service without fear or favor<br>approach such that<br>it's become highly politicized and that<br>needs to be turned back you need to rip<br>the scab off that and to have those<br>conversations is very hard because<br>people<br>who are in the seats right now don't<br>particularly like engaging in those<br>conversations<br>i know i'm i'm an optimist by nature<br>we all are here yeah yeah but i i do<br>think in housing it got to such a<br>terrible state and the the the when we<br>moved to say selling off houses the<br>affordable houses to private um<br>landlords<br>um who didn't have to do them up or<br>anything i think we've moved back to<br>saying<br>and it's not just our research there's<br>quite a number of people who are doing<br>it these this is the kind of things that<br>you should be doing they're set out<br>clearly we work with<br>acc because their injuries are occur in<br>the home we work with the councils<br>because they're trying to<br>make sure that the city doesn't spread<br>out so we were thinking about trying to<br>um make cities that are more resilient<br>for<br>the kind of climate change events that<br>we're going to get we're thinking about<br>where schooling is it's no use building<br>there aren't schools and and the most<br>exciting thing that's happening at the<br>moment which i think is the advantage<br>that we have as a small society<br>is that um the chair of um<br>goshi and he's also had roles in the<br>health service and he knows that<br>basically people get stuck in a hospital<br>because there's nowhere for them to go<br>outside people get stuck in prisons for<br>bail or amman because there's nowhere<br>for them to go um so<br>that we have to start joining up and we<br>have sustaining tenancies and supporting<br>tenancies for people and those kind of<br>conditions it's complicated<br>um obviously people have very complex<br>lives and<br>not everybody would choose some people<br>as neighbors but there are you know 300<br>000 tenants and just a very few of them<br>in trouble so i do think housing is a<br>very good example at the moment that's<br>great and<br>in those communities<br>we all need love yeah we all need<br>someone to smile at us yeah like<br>like yesterday i was um<br>i we'd had our hui for this and i was at<br>new world and as i walked into new world<br>there was a young fella sitting on the<br>ground playing a guitar<br>for some monies<br>and um<br>i got my groceries came out put it in<br>the car and then headed back to say<br>hello to the young fella<br>and put some money in this thing and um<br>and<br>i could just see<br>see the looks from people that were<br>saying<br>don't encourage them you know what i<br>mean it was and<br>but anyway<br>he was playing a guitar i don't care if<br>he's clapping<br>singing out of tune or whatever he was<br>doing something and anyway put the<br>monies in his thing and<br>and then i looked at him and i said<br>i think i know you bro<br>and then he said shane walker i know you<br>and<br>and so in answer the question<br>the best way that the average citizen<br>can contribute meaningfully to<br>addressing the issues of inequality<br>it starts in our neighborhoods<br>in the places where we shop<br>and in the care we have<br>for those who have less than us<br>or whose behaviour<br>might show that they're not being cared<br>for<br>properly it starts with our compassion<br>it starts with the way that if someone<br>is standing in the middle of the road<br>trying to direct traffic with a bottle<br>in one hand and hitting cars in the<br>other we don't stand on either side of<br>the sidewalk and laugh<br>you know we get the right people there<br>straight away and we try and get that<br>person off the road so<br>i don't think it's just up to those who<br>have political influence<br>i think this kind of movement is ground<br>up<br>where and again during covert we've seen<br>what kiwis are capable of<br>but also during covert<br>we saw how quickly the government could<br>move to spend 45 billion dollars<br>now why can't we deal with poverty when<br>we're only a country of<br>i think i know that person actually<br>because i remember the person that knew<br>well playing the guitar yeah singing and<br>i still put money in this<br>in a suitcase there and he actually<br>stopped singing and said thank you yeah<br>amazing kindness can go a wrong way<br>question for helen<br>is the concept of universal basic income<br>worth considering<br>i i think it is and i mean my data<br>already relies on you know information<br>about<br>mean and median income levels and<br>looking at<br>where they are relative to higher income<br>levels so<br>setting a basic income with<br>consideration<br>i think it is but people are worth more<br>than that and i think firms have to<br>start thinking about how do you value<br>your employees<br>you know when i look at the median data<br>for 2022 some firms you know their<br>median income levels<br>are around 47 000 a year which is twenty<br>three dollars an hour that's just<br>slightly more than the minimum wage at<br>the moment so that really brings into<br>question well how much do you value the<br>people who work for you who are often<br>front-facing who are providing that<br>in-service or product they're the last<br>connection that that customer has with<br>your business and thinking more about<br>how do you affect change in a way that<br>shows value to those people so that they<br>can also participate in the profit<br>sharing<br>opportunities that come through the the<br>growth of your enterprise and the<br>quality of what you do so i think it has<br>to go beyond just thinking about<br>minimums<br>we really need to think about<br>adding value to individuals in a way<br>that is recognized through how they<br>contribute to<br>what the business does as a whole all<br>right thank you alan shorter question<br>and i'm going to direct this one admiral<br>how can tertiary education providers<br>increase student retention particularly<br>of students from low ses backgrounds<br>um<br>i i firmly believe which is the<br>conversation we have quite often um<br>here at university is the approach of<br>meaningful engagement and that's through<br>the holistic approach of understanding<br>that with parity groups as seen by tec<br>and emoe<br>um you know pacific a maori student says<br>you don't just focus in on the student<br>it's what comes with the student it's<br>who's around the student<br>the environment um and it's also looking<br>at<br>the structures that you have in place<br>within your tertiary education provider<br>and<br>whether they are competent and being<br>able to address<br>some of our parity groups and the<br>competent is in not just cultural<br>competency because i think when we say<br>cultural competency it's more<br>the behavioral application of cultural<br>competence i think that's not enough it<br>needs to have more of a lens around<br>cultural intelligence and so<br>i think and that's more the<br>understanding of why<br>students struggle to put their hand up<br>in lectures you know why students need<br>to go to a tonguey that might take ten<br>days for two weeks<br>and then understanding that um grades<br>are also a massive contributor to<br>retention so being<br>empathetic in grades and not saying i'm<br>not saying you know let's lessen the<br>standard of of um of our grades but more<br>so understanding that<br>whatever grade you give a student that<br>you've considered their background<br>especially if they've come for extension<br>but also<br>um<br>what they can do for them and them<br>staying here because it doesn't seem<br>like a big thing that tissue education<br>providers have fully grasped but we have<br>as student association<br>their grades are a huge<br>um<br>assessment method of the wrong essays<br>does that have to change oh<br>big time i think these other ways of<br>being as i go into this doctor but i<br>think there's other ways of being able<br>to measure the student's understanding<br>and then how do you agree with you but<br>yeah i also think um<br>i think i think<br>and particularly for oral cultures for<br>cultures where<br>people are generally more extroverted<br>better on their feet and the way they<br>can think and all that kind of things<br>we do have to look at other forms of<br>assessment<br>because you know if you think of the<br>the stuff that's regurgitated at stage<br>one and two when really you're after<br>thinking thinking and you're wanting<br>people to grasp kind of broad concepts<br>and work their way through them<br>i think<br>we've got to be really creative in<br>assessments and again it's another thing<br>that came out of covert<br>people started to think differently<br>about a whole lot of those things<br>and also<br>what's the point of all this knowledge<br>if we can't change that don't change<br>that well we don't work towards it well<br>the themes are coming through the<br>questions is about how do we change<br>right yes uh and i mean that's the<br>that's the real question<br>and if you were talking about<br>significant change that is required in<br>this space or for example<br>tamariki and how they operate<br>you are<br>challenged at on multiple fronts<br>what happened with<br>as i remember because i was on the small<br>group that wrote the report that led to<br>the government of the day<br>setting up aurangataki to try and<br>improve upon children a young person's<br>family service<br>is that<br>it was accepted<br>the idea of culture change was something<br>easy to talk about and became incredibly<br>difficult to do in<br>a sen in a in essence was not done there<br>was a change in building<br>there was a change of name but the same<br>people from the old organization moved<br>into the driver's seat and so what did<br>you get after five or six years of the<br>change not much of it and what it<br>changed in a<br>in an honest attempt to improve things<br>was some things got changed for the<br>worse as we all well aware of in new<br>zealand now<br>so the irony of it for me at least is<br>that<br>every time this issue comes up in the<br>context of waranga tamariki everyone<br>says there's a thousand reports<br>why don't we just get on and fix the<br>problem i get that<br>but the report i was involved in made a<br>very important point<br>more than a hundred times someone's gone<br>through and counted the number of times<br>this was set which is if this does not<br>work for maori it will not work for new<br>zealand because 68 of the clients<br>children and care<br>were those people<br>maori right<br>that's what i mean so<br>if you didn't build a service that was<br>attuned and prioritized maori<br>world views ways of preferred ways of<br>operating it was doomed to failure and<br>guess what happened<br>and it's not over<br>and it's still recoverable but it's been<br>much longer to get to that cultural<br>change position where things will<br>fundamentally alter<br>now<br>that sounds like i'm blaming someone i'm<br>not blaming anyone because real change<br>is bloody hard human beings<br>by definition are almost invested in the<br>status quo because they don't like<br>uncertainty and they don't particularly<br>like change so what we're up against<br>here is something's always been a<br>challenge throughout history and across<br>the world<br>so if we can just get that on the table<br>and stop blaming each other and stop<br>passing the buck uh do what we can at<br>our level and position and then<br>hopefully when we move to more<br>collective orientation in society as<br>opposed to individual individual sort of<br>american id<br>things will start to<br>accrue and aggregate and we'll get a bit<br>of wind in ourselves<br>but i do think that we need to work out<br>a<br>a method of interacting with each other<br>depending you know regardless of<br>political background or beliefs in a way<br>we don't do the typical new zealand<br>things which is either<br>be pleasant and stab the people behind<br>their back once they're out of the room<br>or get incredibly strident and start<br>yelling there's a medium middle ground<br>where we can express our views honestly<br>to get to the root of the problem but<br>respectfully and i don't think<br>culturally we're quite up to that yet<br>but i don't be interested in what my<br>panel<br>colleagues think about that we're going<br>to start wrapping up soon one final<br>question<br>shane you're the one who's passionate<br>about child political poverty what are<br>the effective factors that contribute to<br>child poverty and how can we get rid of<br>it i think that everyone here is utterly<br>passionate about child poverty and i<br>also think<br>most of ultiro new zealanders<br>i'm i'm trying to<br>to think<br>in what i think is a new way of thinking<br>about this<br>and that is<br>what does a decolonized<br>child protection system look like in<br>aotearoa in the 21st century<br>and the first thing i would say<br>is we're all on the same side<br>it's not an issue of separating us and<br>government<br>we all have to work in this and so i<br>for me i i see<br>housing employment education<br>justice corrections<br>health<br>maori ngos<br>community ngos<br>kainga order the whole nine yards<br>us<br>rather than us and them because i think<br>the first thing and it's probably and<br>a number of my colleagues especially<br>maori colleagues may not like this<br>but<br>i don't think the state can ever<br>abrogate its responsibility for this so<br>therefore the state will always have a<br>role<br>and so when i think about<br>by maori for maori and with maori<br>i think if it's<br>if it's good for maori it will be good<br>for all of us and so<br>and so when i think about<br>if we start to front load and invest<br>in all those things for children and so<br>for instance in kaianga aura we<br>prioritize 70 of those houses<br>for and please are not speaking you know<br>this is just these are just ideas<br>for<br>children that have families<br>we say to family court judges or<br>district court judges you can't sentence<br>anyone unless a report has been done on<br>the status of those children<br>we say<br>to employers if you employ someone who<br>has three kids<br>we'll give you a tax incentive for you<br>to employ those kids which by the way is<br>what they did with drug addicts in<br>portugal you know they paid people to<br>employ them their rates of addiction<br>went through the floor<br>you know their rates of overdoses went<br>through the floor and no it didn't lead<br>to other drugs<br>you know so<br>we can start thinking about this far<br>more broadly<br>can i pick up on that and say that we<br>need to have a sharing of control and<br>resource between government<br>and communities and that will start with<br>genuine respect for the wisdom that<br>exists within communities and you see<br>grassroots examples of that the all over<br>news at around new zealand<br>the vaccination issue it was um<br>highlighted the capacity of certain<br>groups within society to get up and get<br>going without<br>as some might put it government<br>interference<br>what we need is a genuine devolution of<br>power from central to a more equal<br>equitable sharing of power control and<br>resources and resources in other words<br>politicians<br>go back to their old<br>kind of in theory role which is the<br>servants of the people so the people<br>really matter but these days they can<br>sit around the top table or<br>representatives of the of the people to<br>make these decisions about how we attack<br>wicked problems like poverty<br>yeah i was just going to make the point<br>in the question before about um what<br>could we do mostly i mean i think<br>really good public housing that<br>community absolutely councillors and<br>critical and often ask people what<br>portion of do you think we have in new<br>zealand of that what's your proportion<br>of public housing do you think we've got<br>fifteen percent just<br>uh yeah i'd guess um i guess fifteen<br>four percent or percent four percent and<br>that and if you're in public housing<br>that that that proportion is set by<br>ministry of housing and urban<br>development and goes through msd we<br>can't just build more we have to decide<br>that is a not not enough um housing<br>public housing of very good quality very<br>well supported and<br>if you're in the private rental sector<br>other than paying with your own public<br>housing you pay 25 of your household<br>income no more than that but actually<br>there are many people now paying 50 60<br>of their income just to try and have a<br>roof over their head so i think that<br>that's we've got to get the balance<br>correct there um and just we've had one<br>that we've flipped over here can i just<br>talk about that that that the power<br>block about saying um when the<br>government announced today where the<br>question do you want to know that the<br>question was asked can i say well shall<br>i say that they asked that there was a<br>going to be a tax on the um<br>um the administration the contracting<br>the people who arranged<br>kiwi bank and it was immediately oh<br>they're just going to tax our kiwi bank<br>it isn't it was financial services but<br>there was a push back from the industry<br>really really heavily and and the<br>government has you know pulled in<br>um yeah<br>so we've got just a few minutes left and<br>and here's a question for all of our<br>panelists<br>what are we doing right in aotearoa are<br>we making progress<br>and if you had the power to make one<br>change what would it be let's go<br>backwards because i want to end with<br>melissa so philippa<br>uh what are we doing right<br>i think if we can<br>continue to get our kids to school every<br>day if we can support each other and<br>community like richie is saying we have<br>to to look after one another and similar<br>to what shane has been saying when<br>someone's in need reach out help them<br>encourage them when you see a family<br>struggling do something to make a<br>difference<br>one thing that we could do<br>if i wanted to make change one one thing<br>i would do is bring more support into<br>schools i think schools are essential<br>part of our community where children are<br>involved so bringing in mentors bringing<br>in people who can get alongside families<br>where they need support connecting<br>families to schools to medical resources<br>and other resources that they need and<br>helping to solve problems at that level<br>rather than leaving individuals to rely<br>on agencies that would be my one final<br>recommendation<br>thank you shane<br>i've got a few things i'd like to do one<br>minute<br>okay um<br>i would like the um<br>all of the ces of some of the ministries<br>i've mentioned<br>to have treaty courses and<br>child-friendly clauses<br>in their kpis<br>just for starters but also subsequent<br>policy to reflect that<br>in terms of housing education<br>corrections and all of all of that<br>um<br>and then as a parting shot<br>if<br>if i had<br>you know um<br>a hundred million dollars at the moment<br>i'd like to buy something that competes<br>with the duopoly that controls our<br>supermarkets<br>and put cheap food<br>for all of alte at all<br>because when i think about housing food<br>and energy<br>the basics that make each of us feel<br>fully human<br>and we've let the market control that<br>okay and so what are we doing right and<br>i think we've just gone through them you<br>know the most<br>traumatic thing many of us all go in our<br>lifetimes in kobat and i just finished<br>writing a book with colleagues from 15<br>countries around the world and there's<br>no doubt we've come out of that much<br>better than any other country<br>i i mean<br>it's like i think we often the radio<br>turns on and people are complaining<br>about things and this and that and stuff<br>but there are many things that we're<br>making progress in you know with all the<br>issues that we've adjusted<br>i feel really proud about the sort of<br>co-governance and tatirty you know i<br>compare what's happening in australia<br>and i think oh my goodness and so if i<br>had the power to make change i'd i'd<br>take the lessons from covert that we<br>were too slow and actually reaching out<br>in a formal way to pacific and maori<br>communities and making that at the<br>beginning and and starting from there<br>the next time something happens and if i<br>had power to do something i'd say take<br>up your 15 percent of public housing and<br>i'd make sure that was money that<br>enabled us to do this picking up the<br>kids who are going through<br>apprenticeships the murray companies and<br>the last thing i do is i instead of<br>setting all our wood overseas i'd have<br>to cross laminated timber and build a<br>new<br>iconic kind of state housing<br>i love it<br>magnificent<br>uh so what are we doing right well we've<br>uh<br>we've targeted uh<br>poverty as a major issue we have some<br>legislation that will support us moving<br>further in the right direction we need<br>to put that on steroids<br>and if there was<br>the power to do to make a single change<br>it would be to convince all political<br>parties<br>that prevention<br>is worth investing in everyone will<br>acknowledge yeah the rationale for yeah<br>yeah<br>the nature of politics and three-year<br>cycles<br>they don't want to invest in something<br>now that the next crew the crew after<br>that will get the plaudits for they need<br>to get beyond those selfish needs and<br>probably invest in prevention<br>nipping in the bud the many causal<br>pathways that lead to including and<br>driven largely by poverty not solely<br>nipping that in the bud as early as you<br>can so we don't have 6 000<br>young people through no fault of their<br>own ripped from their<br>whanau<br>for various reasons which is a traumatic<br>event unto itself<br>and once you're in the system guess what<br>happens you get bounced from pillar to<br>post and get a sense of no one cares<br>about me no one loves me and there's no<br>stability ever um waiting for me and<br>that is further damaging so we've got to<br>inquiry into state abuse<br>but there's a soft form of abuse it's<br>not intended of course but that is the<br>consequence<br>uh so if we can drop it from six<br>thousand by ninety percent in the next<br>ten years that'd be great and the same<br>with prisons<br>exactly the same way<br>well actually i know we this is a good<br>news story<br>under the radar<br>the prison population has dropped by 3<br>000 yeah in the last<br>um<br>four years five years now in real<br>figures<br>that's 300 million<br>in savings and savings that can go into<br>preventative things exactly into front<br>loading<br>for<br>children and whanau and<br>celebrate they're gonna have to end it<br>here melissa<br>all right um we could do it all night<br>what are we doing right<br>i think i want to give this time and<br>acknowledge our you know communities our<br>grassroots communities um for their<br>mobilization and work behind the scenes<br>um and that's not off the work of<br>government they didn't have to wait<br>especially during covert i think we need<br>to recognize that they are champions of<br>the communities and slowly but surely<br>i think um you know those in power are<br>starting to listen which is good and i'm<br>hopeful that that relationship<br>um can lead to something greater and if<br>i had a power it would be to install<br>more bravery<br>um in a lot of our decision makers you<br>know and it's it's a young person we<br>often sit and talk and we're like man<br>someone just just be brave like capital<br>gain sex just do it you know that moment<br>we all waited for and so<br>justin bravery would be you know show us<br>so that we can feel that we're stepping<br>into something that is already safe and<br>already ready what the difference it<br>thank you everyone<br>thank you to our panel for your<br>contributions tonight thank you to all<br>those
