degree<br>we're really focusing on welcoming you<br>to the university introducing you to how<br>university<br>life works and we're sort of looking to<br>bring you into three main conversations<br>so writing ideas reading would be one<br>kind of catchment and then studio life<br>and then workshops and so we do that<br>through three courses when you first<br>arrive with us the ideas writing courses<br>really teaching you about the language<br>we will be using<br>ways to unpack ideas ways to learn how<br>to connect your ideas to other people's<br>ideas<br>through reading writing listening<br>sharing so and then in the studio papers<br>we start introducing you work in a<br>studio with a lot of other students a<br>lot of staff and we'll start bringing<br>projects<br>along and you start to kind of<br>experiment with just different<br>disciplines that we will<br>that are compulsory for the first year<br>so we run through performance sculpture<br>photography painting print and a kind of<br>social practice so you move through<br>these courses quite quickly as a way of<br>kind of giving you a big range of<br>experience some of that you may be<br>familiar with and some that you won't be<br>familiar with and that is really popular<br>with our students and often they will<br>tell us that the ones that they didn't<br>want to do end up being their favorite<br>so that's a really rich and exciting<br>experience<br>then also the workshops are a really<br>important part of studying to study at<br>elon and what we do is there's a course<br>that's just for workshops that's through<br>so for a nine week period<br>every week you'll be in a different<br>workshop facility in our school and it's<br>students love those course to bits<br>because they'll make a little<br>experimental object in every single<br>workshop so they'll learn something<br>about metal the metal workshop the wood<br>workshop a clay workshop a casting<br>workshop digital printing video<br>photography and they'll get to meet the<br>technicians and understand what's<br>available it's kind of like laying out a<br>small sport of all the things that<br>you'll get to play with in your time at<br>elam so it's a very exciting and fun<br>course and all of these three courses<br>are just geared up to get you into the<br>school get you understanding what's<br>going on and from there you start to<br>make your own choices about courses<br>about what excites you and where you<br>want to direct your practice so we sort<br>of start you all together and then you<br>start to branch out into your own<br>spaces<br>because design is a relatively broad<br>discipline in itself<br>there are a whole lot of different<br>opportunities<br>for the students to experience along the<br>way so the two<br>primary courses or foundational courses<br>in the first year are<br>one that's more theoretical<br>and involves a bit of writing it<br>explores the history of design<br>it gets students to think a little bit<br>more critically<br>about design practice and to be able to<br>position it in<br>in terms of written and theoretical<br>discourse and then we've got a more<br>practically orientated<br>studio course<br>where<br>you will focus on learning<br>particular technologies and different<br>ways of making all focused on<br>different projects<br>and<br>in first year the focus is really around<br>physical making um so using digital<br>technologies 3d printing laser cutting<br>etc so again like fine arts i'm getting<br>a really good understanding of the of<br>the workshop of the fab lab space that<br>we have and<br>using those<br>new found<br>prototype outcomes<br>and<br>most of that happens in the first<br>semester second semester is very much<br>this opportunity to start to<br>elect and select um courses um and we we<br>have four different pillars one around<br>emerging technology one around community<br>and sort of social practice<br>one around global issues which is around<br>sustainability and the last one is<br>focused on business<br>and so<br>there are different elective courses in<br>each of those pillars that students get<br>to take in the second semester and<br>continue to take throughout the program<br>so again that sort of customization<br>already comes through<br>first year consists of courses in media<br>and communication and architectural<br>technology<br>and in architectural history in theory<br>the the core of the program ultimately<br>is the design studio the design program<br>and<br>media<br>tech and history theory criticism as<br>well as eventually practice and<br>management all feed into<br>the design studio and start to inform<br>inform your practice and form the way<br>that you make so a lot of people come<br>come to the program<br>with varying backgrounds from varying<br>backgrounds<br>varying skills<br>and it's about trying to find your place<br>for that skill or that skill base<br>within<br>within the discipline so you're making<br>you're making models you're making<br>drawings you're making any<br>different kind of digital propositions<br>augmented reality potentially<br>so that's a really big introduction in<br>that first and that first part<br>and then it gradually becomes more and<br>more specific<br>as we go through<br>in terms of employment and in design or<br>after studying in the design program<br>uh<br>our program is very much it's porous<br>in the sense that we try as much as<br>possible to bring industry into the<br>program and also to get students out of<br>the studio space into into the world<br>outside so we<br>have multiple<br>industry partners that come in<br>for particular projects so in a sense as<br>a student in the design program you are<br>building your social capital<br>you're building your<br>your connections and your networks while<br>you're actually learning in the program<br>so that by the time you leave<br>you already know<br>a fair amount of<br>i suppose industry professionals<br>again that might be tailored towards<br>your particular areas of interest at the<br>moment i think there are<br>significant job opportunities when you<br>start to look up<br>design jobs and you start to see the<br>hosts that come up<br>so with regards to design research<br>strategy<br>service design positions<br>and i suppose you know one of the things<br>that's really important to think about<br>is that the world is changing so fast<br>and so<br>a lot of the time the way that curricula<br>developed is that by the time students<br>get out into the world you know the jobs<br>have really shifted and i think i can<br>almost guarantee you that a design<br>education is one that is going to enable<br>you to have the skills and the thinking<br>and the ability to engage with the world<br>that will prepare you for a very wide<br>range of jobs once you leave the design<br>program<br>a bfa graduate<br>is someone who<br>really charts their own path and i mean<br>i could say from the years of speaking<br>of teaching at elon that i've seen<br>students thrive in the cultural sector<br>curatorial sector being artists<br>moving to design moving to architecture<br>i guess what we focus on is we focus on<br>teaching you about art teaching you how<br>to<br>gain confidence in your ideas and gain<br>confidence in your understanding of the<br>wider context in which you work you know<br>so that<br>you go to a gallery and you read a wall<br>text and you understand it and you can<br>say no i'm not really into that idea you<br>know you know your position you've<br>figured out how to articulate your<br>perspective on how things<br>sit or at least how to ask questions in<br>an interesting way so we're teaching you<br>about art but we're also teaching you<br>how to be inquisitive how to be in the<br>world and how to reflect what's going on<br>around you in a really creative way and<br>to think outside the box so what we<br>often say i suppose is that yes we're<br>teaching you how to be an artist or to<br>work in any type of creative sector that<br>you want to but we're also thinking you<br>how to be a resilient individual and a<br>creative individual in a world that's<br>really changing very quickly i mean<br>architecture's<br>vocationally focused<br>without being vocational<br>we have an accredited program<br>to become a registered architect you<br>need to essentially need to have done<br>five years<br>inside a<br>an accredited program inside a school of<br>architecture our final two years is what<br>is accredited so that's a profession<br>what we call a professional pathway and<br>yes it's geared towards<br>people becoming architects and the<br>larger proportion of our students<br>leave<br>our<br>either either at the end of our bas or<br>the end of our remark prof and go out<br>and get work as as architects in the<br>profession<br>there are many who<br>will complete the bas<br>and then find<br>that they don't want to go on and become<br>a professional architect but the skills<br>that they've gathered are<br>equally applicable in other disciplines<br>we have<br>other students who will<br>all go out and from the bas and do<br>any number of things<br>but a lot of it has to do with the<br>building industry there are others who<br>web design and<br>app companies<br>and then of course then we get others<br>who will go out from the bas and get<br>work<br>and doing other things inside the<br>building<br>industry most of our studio teachers are<br>practicing architects who come in<br>and um<br>such as their commitment to the<br>discipline<br>they're dedicating their time to<br>teaching and<br>our students<br>up and coming architects<br>so that's a wonderful way to kind of use<br>the word social capital it's a way to<br>meet and start building on building<br>networks through your studio<br>teachers and the people who come in and<br>critique and review the work we always<br>think that the the most powerful network<br>that you'll develop with us is each<br>other<br>um you know you'll i love the first day<br>at elon when students arrive because<br>they've all been that that kid in their<br>school that's interested in art and then<br>on the first day they meet all the other<br>ones<br>and it's so exciting for those people to<br>sort of find this network so that bond<br>grows through your time at halum and<br>they become your power network and they<br>will help change the future generations<br>of the cultural landscape of new zealand<br>so that's where the true power is but we<br>also of course do lots of things to<br>connect you to<br>different partners we go to galleries<br>we'll introduce you to curators and lots<br>of other artists in the time that you're<br>there and different organizations that<br>work in different ways in the cultural<br>sector so<br>it's definitely a very connected<br>experience and then as a graduating<br>student we get professional photos taken<br>of your work that get profiled on our<br>elim artists website which is a really<br>amazing resource for<br>showing off all of our students and<br>their amazing achievements while they're<br>at elim so<br>there's lots of ways that we will<br>connect you to the big sprawling arts<br>community of new zealand if you're<br>inspired by the built environment<br>um whether that be physical whether it<br>be digital whether that's an augmented<br>reality whether it's<br>potentially a movie set or whether it's<br>your house or whether it's the city if<br>you're inspired by the built environment<br>and how that sh impacts and shapes<br>people<br>and how<br>you might like to shape that<br>then it's an<br>architecture i think is<br>yeah i mean i think i think design is is<br>really looking at the the social<br>technological<br>physical environment or<br>and how those all come together so it's<br>it provides you with a way of engaging<br>with complexity it begins with you<br>seeing the world and seeing that there<br>is change that's necessary<br>and then being able to have the tools<br>and provide you with the tools to be<br>able to look at this complexity and then<br>say okay how do i intervene into the<br>world and those<br>interventions<br>can be<br>um technological can be physical can be<br>systems um can be services<br>it could be social yeah so i mean they<br>they're at a whole range of different<br>dimensions<br>um but relatively bored because<br>ultimately the solution needs to be able<br>to respond to the complexity of the of<br>the problem at hand and so yeah if you<br>think fine arts it's sort of i guess<br>maybe an in more independent path in the<br>sense that you fill your basket with the<br>things you're interested and the output<br>is what you choose it to be um and it<br>and then that is enormous excitement and<br>also challenge right because you sort of<br>you it's a very open<br>frame of what you do and you know<br>whereas you might end up working with<br>clients related to buildings and<br>infrastructure<br>you might work with clients related to<br>other outcomes often the relationship of<br>an artist is either independent or<br>constantly changing related to galleries<br>or exhibitions or even<br>you know instagram or whatever your sort<br>of independent operation is i think we<br>like to stay in this sort of speculative<br>and<br>development of ideas and the production<br>of objects for sharing and making and<br>images i think there's a there's a<br>there's a fundamental difference between<br>architecture and fine arts and possibly<br>between design and<br>and fine arts as well is that<br>we are often<br>working on representations<br>of a thing that will be made by other<br>people<br>whereas artists are often working on the<br>final object itself<br>i think that<br>definitely something that i learnt in<br>school was<br>putting yourself into a box too early on<br>really did limit you know your<br>opportunities going forward and so<br>yeah at school i took multiple subjects<br>and sort of experimented and tried to<br>see exactly where my passions<br>sat i think that that's important<br>allowing allowing opportunities and<br>looking for them but at the same time<br>yeah when you find something that just<br>really kind of has that spark inside you<br>um you know trust trust that instinct i<br>think it's probably one of our most<br>powerful<br>senses although we don't really talk<br>about it as a sense it's really it's<br>really hard at the moment the world is<br>so<br>it's so complicated and it is changing<br>so fast<br>um<br>that yeah this idea that you're kind of<br>going to dedicate yourself to a<br>particular<br>stream of study<br>again<br>i think that i mean the way that we<br>talked about design architecture and<br>fine arts today any one of those<br>disciplines would allow you<br>to be flexible<br>and to be able to<br>undertake creative practice um<br>ultimately<br>in a in a way that's quite satisfying um<br>and that's cool you gotta you gotta<br>enjoy what you do yeah<br>think about the<br>bigger picture and make decisions you<br>know if if a friend<br>creates a definition for you of what art<br>is there's a million other definitions<br>in the world and you'll find the one<br>that works for you so i suppose it's<br>like think bigger than just what's<br>around you would be<br>my immediate thought</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
