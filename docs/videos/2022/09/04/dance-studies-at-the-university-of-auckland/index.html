lecturer and<br>the undergraduate advisor in dance<br>studies at the university of auckland i<br>desperately love dance because of the<br>ways that it brings people together and<br>it brings people together who maybe<br>wouldn't ordinarily<br>uh find each other in the world i think<br>when you come to dance studies<br>especially<br>there's a number of people in the room<br>who are incredibly diverse and bring a<br>wealth of knowledge different<br>backgrounds different journeys different<br>ideas about what dance means and that<br>connection that happens in the dance<br>studio can be really magical and very<br>transformative<br>i think it's an incredibly exciting<br>experience to have<br>and joining me today is danielle 20man<br>who is a recent graduate of the bachelor<br>of dance studies kia ora my name is<br>danielle twenty-man and i'm a fresh<br>undergraduate student here at the<br>university of auckland<br>why i love dance is because i feel like<br>i get to share my passion with so many<br>people and get to make connections with<br>people as well<br>on many different levels and discover<br>many different things<br>about who we are what we have to offer<br>so my first year i was definitely<br>challenged in a really great way and it<br>felt very rewarding to go through it and<br>to learn about all kinds of dance i<br>especially loved the choreography paper<br>at the end of the year because i feel<br>like after everything we did in the year<br>it kind of was a moment for us to bring<br>in everything we<br>had learned over the time and bring in<br>all the different aspects of dance and<br>get to share it with all our people and<br>all our loved ones and kind of<br>yeah yeah it's a nice culmination of all<br>of the things that end of year yeah<br>performance choreography performance<br>everyone has a chance to show who they<br>are and what they've learned and what<br>they've taken away from<br>the whole year in the bachelor of dance<br>studies we work predominantly in the<br>dance studio and we're right now in our<br>beautiful building in the heart of the<br>university of auckland city campus we've<br>got three studios in this building and<br>then upstairs we have our social area<br>and all of our staff offices and it's a<br>really great place to be but in most of<br>your courses you'll be in the dance<br>studio<br>sitting on the floor in a circle with<br>your teachers with your peers<br>you'll be dancing you'll be talking<br>you'll be looking at video material<br>reading material you'll be having<br>discussions but this is really where it<br>all takes place the timetables were<br>different in semester one and semester<br>two it just depended on what courses you<br>had and when but um yeah there wasn't a<br>consistent nine to five kind of day it<br>just depended on when you were coming in<br>and for what subjects in each paper you<br>tend to have<br>two or three classes a week and each<br>class will be around two hours um so<br>your timetable sort of looks a little<br>bit bitsy doesn't it but actually<br>you end up being quite busy with extra<br>rehearsals<br>what kinds of things would you be doing<br>in amongst your class<br>yeah definitely practicing and<br>rehearsing with peers outside of class<br>um i think<br>yeah for the assessments for that kind<br>of part of it but then we'd also be<br>collaborating and working on different<br>uh<br>lesson plans different structures for<br>writing essays writing essays getting<br>together having study groups<br>yeah to kind of<br>get the work done okay<br>yeah yeah so in your first year of a<br>bachelor of dance studies uh you'll be<br>doing eight different papers so four in<br>each semester and the first year of<br>dance studies is really to provide a<br>broad foundational learning experience<br>and dance in a variety of areas<br>the papers that you'll find yourself<br>doing your dance education paper where<br>you learn all about<br>who you are as a dance teacher as an<br>educator and what kind of educational<br>facilitator<br>you might like to be in the future you<br>have your contemporary dance<br>vocabularies paper<br>which i'm teaching at the moment with<br>our amazing first year cohort<br>we learn dance phrases we learn dance<br>technique you do a kapahaka paper and a<br>pacific music and dance paper which are<br>really central to being a dance<br>practitioner in aotearoa and oceania and<br>then in your second semester you're<br>going to do<br>choreography with me again and we have a<br>really great time in that paper you do<br>kinesiology learning all about how your<br>body works and learning about how to<br>move safely and facilitate other<br>people's movements safely you have your<br>dance history paper learning about<br>important practitioners artists<br>who have<br>transformed what dance means to us in<br>the 21st century and then you have a<br>dance writing paper so looking at<br>academic writing looking at dance<br>like creative writing poetry<br>transforming movement into writing as<br>well and so really really broad spectrum<br>of of papers and experiences in dance so<br>some dancing some performing some<br>choreographing some teaching some<br>learning and following<br>you do presentations you do dance film<br>projects you do<br>essays have i missed anything picture<br>coaches<br>so it's really looking at<br>how can you communicate what you're<br>learning and dance in a variety of<br>different modes and so you're developing<br>that portfolio of skills in your first<br>year all of those papers across the<br>board will then be developed when you go<br>into your second and third year of your<br>bachelor of dance studies so those are<br>the foundational ones and then obviously<br>you're jumping up a level and then upper<br>level again into your third year in<br>terms of the critical thinking and the<br>expectations for the rigor of your<br>so many of you will want to know how do<br>i get in<br>and to gain entry into the bachelor of<br>dance studies first of all you need to<br>fill out the online application form<br>through the university of auckland<br>website one of the questions that i<br>always get um coming through is what<br>should i put in my cv and what should i<br>write about in the written statement<br>so starting with the cv we want to get a<br>broad sense of who you are as a human as<br>well as what your dance background is<br>and whatever you want to put into that<br>cv that you think are the most important<br>things about you you should write those<br>things down but some useful bits to<br>include are your dance backgrounds so<br>whatever dance learning you've done<br>leading up uh to this application point<br>and that might be your studio dance it<br>might be your crew that you're with your<br>hip-hop crew might be your nca dance<br>experience it might be community dance<br>work performances that you've done<br>competitions it can be anything but<br>getting a sense of the overall pathway<br>of your dance interest and the different<br>influences that you've had<br>are really valuable for us to see<br>we like to know if you're engaged in the<br>community somewhere if you do work with<br>your church or<br>with any local community groups if you<br>have been teaching dance we want to know<br>about that we want to know what your<br>interests are your other hobbies if you<br>play basketball in the weekend put that<br>in and all of those things help us to<br>get a sense of<br>what's important to you who you are<br>and what kind of person we might be<br>inviting into the program you also need<br>to provide a written statement and in<br>that it can be maybe a page a half a<br>page um<br>really articulating perhaps why you want<br>to come to dance studies what you're<br>aiming to do when you graduate<br>or anything else about your dance<br>journey or your life journey that you<br>want us to know and we really value<br>those two documents because as i said we<br>want to know who you are as a person<br>it's not just about your dancing and<br>your dance background we're looking for<br>well-rounded humans<br>who are going to contribute back to<br>dance studies just as much as<br>we help help you get where you're going<br>so that's step one<br>from there you'll be invited to join a<br>workshop audition were you nervous how<br>was your experience of auditioning no it<br>wasn't nerve-wracking at all i think<br>coming into the space it felt very warm<br>and inclusive and everyone kind of got<br>really stuck into it i remember<br>the the dance study students who led the<br>audition when i was the auditioner they<br>were<br>really getting the monster and then they<br>allowed us to<br>kind of interact with each other and<br>co-create and form together the dance<br>rather than it kind of being a<br>you're there and i'm here<br>type situation it was really great just<br>being able to relax into the process and<br>yeah i felt super super comfortable and<br>that's typically held on a weekend and<br>it is very informal so you might<br>think of an audition<br>where you have to wear a leotard<br>and you have a number<br>and there's people at the front of the<br>room with a white tablecloth and a cup<br>of water it's not like that at all we<br>try to keep it really friendly and i<br>hope it was friendly<br>really friendly we have our students um<br>our current students will teach that<br>workshop have you taught that what you<br>have haven't you yeah one yeah so you've<br>been on both sides where you've<br>auditioned and you've been facilitating<br>yeah that workshop usually includes a<br>warm-up maybe a game<br>doing some phrases of material so<br>learning learning some movement and then<br>also some choreographic work as well and<br>in that we want to see<br>who you are<br>how you interact with other people in<br>the room what kind of energy you bring<br>what kind of person you are then at the<br>end of that session there's time for<br>one-on-one chats with the staff members<br>who are observing and we just want to<br>get to know you a little bit better but<br>there's also an opportunity for you to<br>ask us questions because it's just as<br>important that you know what you're<br>getting yourself into and that you feel<br>like dance studies is the right place<br>for you<br>as well as us thinking about whether<br>you're a good fit for us while we're<br>doing those we really like for<br>applicants to chat to the current<br>students and through that process you<br>can ask them questions perhaps that you<br>think they might be able to answer<br>better<br>or maybe you don't want to ask the staff<br>and we leave you to it to have a chat<br>with the current students<br>to get a sense of what dance studies<br>life is<br>truly like as a student<br>in that audition process um<br>we don't look for<br>the perfect dancer with a particular<br>body type<br>you should turn up<br>as who you are we want you to wear what<br>you're comfortable wearing we don't need<br>you to bring any particular dance gear<br>you don't need to prepare a solo or<br>anything to perform to us we will<br>facilitate that workshop<br>and show you everything that you need to<br>learn along the way um<br>we try and keep it fun and friendly and<br>with a bit of banter and a bit of<br>laughter because if you're feeling<br>relaxed then you'll show your best self<br>tell us about your journey in<br>into dance studies oh my goodness yeah<br>so i grew up dancing from a very young<br>age and i was in studios in the<br>community but then when i went to high<br>school i studied ncea<br>dance studies and that's where i was<br>kind of opened up to a broader range of<br>the possibilities and the potentialities<br>and dance<br>and yeah my high school teacher was the<br>one who encouraged me to take a step<br>into dance studies and to learn it<br>we have had people in the program<br>who have<br>been in hip-hop crews we've got a strong<br>hip-hop culture within dance studies<br>lots of students coming in through that<br>pathway through local crews<br>throughout the country we have students<br>who have come in through the ncea dance<br>pathway and they've done lots of stage<br>challenge<br>and you dance and learning in local<br>dance studios and perhaps training in<br>western dance forms like ballet or<br>contemporary or jazz other students um<br>coming in from a cultural<br>background who maybe have done polyfest<br>they've been very involved in<br>perhaps community or<br>high school<br>kappa haka groups we do have students<br>who have done very little dance training<br>before and maybe they're unfamiliar with<br>contemporary dance technique or some of<br>the other styles that we teach<br>when you apply for the bachelor of dance<br>studies it's important to recognize that<br>we intentionally seek out a really<br>diverse range of people we want to know<br>who you are as a mover<br>who you want to be as a creative as a<br>practitioner and how dance has impacted<br>you in your life and maybe where you<br>want to take dance in the future what i<br>would say to my younger self before<br>studying dance studies is to definitely<br>keep an open mind<br>you learn so many different things from<br>so many different people and i think<br>yeah in terms of keeping an open mind<br>you never know where you're going to end<br>up in the end and you never know what<br>possibilities and opportunities are<br>going to present themselves to you so in<br>keeping that open mind saying yes to<br>everything that does present itself to<br>you you can find yourself in some really<br>wonderful places and having some really<br>wonderful experiences with so many<br>different people<br>and yeah it's an exciting journey to go<br>on</p></main><footer
