program<br>actually we're training uh practitioners<br>you know dealing with the kind of<br>the problems and we know that because of<br>the complexity of urban issues the the<br>challenges and the issues and problems<br>are changing constantly so we change and<br>restructure or progress actually to<br>address these type of issues and<br>also teach the kind of the skills<br>to our students to deal with this kind<br>of the<br>the problems in future because there are<br>the general exchange of planners<br>definitely they should deal with this<br>kind of other stations so two years back<br>we restructured the undergrad program<br>here so it's which means that we move to<br>the kind of the balance between the<br>practice and the theory so the main<br>transformation is that actually we move<br>from a kind of the<br>theory base to more practice based 50 of<br>the<br>the semester first semester for example<br>is the studio<br>and another half divided in the two<br>lecture based courses<br>so in the first semester students will<br>learn about uh planning introduction to<br>minimum introduction to planning so<br>students will learn about the history of<br>the cities and the problems and why we<br>have a planning as a discipline you know<br>and what's the role of the planners<br>at the beginning and then they will<br>learn about some<br>social issues uh regarding to<br>uh urban urban planning<br>uh and at the same time in studio they<br>will learn about the basic things<br>softwares and uh and kind of the skills<br>are drawing and what we need to know you<br>know and this is required for the design<br>perspective especially<br>in the second semester we move to the<br>other level again we have a same<br>structure um half a system semester is<br>uh is a kind of studio based it's a 50<br>percent and<br>the second half again divided into two<br>lecture based ones we focus on economics<br>which is the very important<br>uh for um<br>for planners because we are living a<br>kind of market-based system so we need<br>to know how the city is working based on<br>the economy and financial system<br>second one we looked at the<br>environmental issues<br>and we learned about environmental<br>indexes what we have regarding to the<br>sustainability resilience you know well<br>being in this kind of<br>dimensions and<br>we translate this kind of knowledge into<br>the kind of uh studio-based activities<br>so as you can see we built the kind of<br>the basic knowledge in the first year<br>regarding to the multi-dimensions of the<br>planning because planning is<br>interdisciplinary<br>and also we focus on the practice so<br>what we learn in a lecture based on most<br>of the time inform what we are doing in<br>studios<br>so for studios most of the time we<br>invite people who come from the practice<br>to teach studios and cover city-based<br>type of activities because again we<br>train the next generation of the<br>planners and the practice is the base of<br>our actions in the future<br>uh what do you think mike in my first<br>year we did economics as i mentioned<br>before introduction to urban planning<br>we did law that's great um and<br>two studios and one of the<br>graphing kind of<br>courses as well visualization yes yeah<br>that's the one um<br>i personally really loved studio because<br>it it was kind of a way to like<br>think about how we're solving the issues<br>um as we learn from like the theory<br>classes and like<br>how we can accommodate those in like<br>future developments<br>and it was quite rewarding because<br>you feel like you're doing a real<br>project and you're getting a taste for<br>like<br>um life after uni um<br>actually in practice which was really<br>interesting<br>fantastic absolutely it's one of the<br>reasons actually we realized that our<br>students like more<br>kind of the<br>studio type of activities instead of you<br>know just the theory one so but<br>um at the same time you know uh<br>i think what what's covered there<br>in all the studios we try to<br>uh address the the kind of the tangible<br>issues we have in our cities like<br>housing traffic you know social<br>inequality though and so it's kind of<br>the things we cover in the studio as<br>well in the theory at the same time<br>so um yeah in that case we i think we<br>design kind of infrastructure or program<br>the way you know especially for the ones<br>like yourself but really like this kind<br>of building environment finding the<br>solutions for<br>urban issues by living in a city facing<br>this kind of things it's your everyday<br>life but you're feeling this kind of the<br>problems you're stuck in the traffic and<br>somebody should address it it's the role<br>of the planet isn't it yeah so we are<br>dealing with the kind of the tangible<br>problems and as a residents and the<br>planners we try to address them but we<br>learn some theories in the class and<br>then try to absolutely and practice it<br>in the studio do you think we were quite<br>successful in that case<br>yeah i feel like we are um<br>i mean it really just all starts to come<br>together like after first year um<br>because<br>you started to get like a<br>taste of more and more like issues<br>that's in our city and like how they all<br>like work together that's correct um and<br>then<br>you have to think in like a way that<br>like kind of solves all these issues<br>which<br>um<br>challenging<br>definitely but um also it's what keeps<br>keeps it interesting<br>i think<br>we we address all kind of the urban<br>issues and not just the urban one i can<br>say you know we have sometimes we have a<br>kind of the bigger picture like a<br>climate change you know so it's a range<br>of the issues in different special<br>levels you know sometimes the national<br>level sometimes the regional level<br>sometimes the city level and<br>even we go to the neighborhood level and<br>i feel like a huge part of it is<br>predicting what's going to happen<br>absolutely in the future whether like<br>population change or<br>um climate change yeah and we're trying<br>to like prepare everything<br>ready for those changes because we're<br>forecast about the future and we plan<br>for the current issues but also we have<br>long perspectives you know like 5 10 or<br>25 years you know perspective in our<br>plans<br>so it's kind of the way we try actually<br>to develop our plans and policies to<br>address the existing issues and also<br>predict potential issues in the future i<br>think in economics you um<br>you must get investigated a lot about<br>the housing isn't it it's very hot topic<br>here<br>so<br>it's another tangible problem we have<br>yeah<br>but we are thinking about solutions in<br>the planning you know for housing what<br>do you think dude um<br>we just learned like housing is a wicked<br>problem it's all linked to everything<br>else but um<br>yeah no like i i think is really<br>interesting how like housing is um<br>so like interconnected with like<br>defining sector like even<br>with a small thing like lower interest<br>rate that's<br>like from the central government a<br>finance like financial system you know<br>kind of that contributes in this kind of<br>problem<br>and also connections with the housing<br>for example with other sectors like<br>infrastructure transportation for<br>example investment but intensification<br>investigation has some consequences like<br>increasing the traffic potentially yeah<br>we have if we have a kind of the car<br>based model so as a planner all the time<br>thinking about infrastructure<br>transportation beside the housing<br>because housing should be considered<br>connection with the other problems lack<br>of infrastructure yeah we're doing like<br>a<br>assignment right now based on like<br>um<br>transit oriented development so we're<br>trying to like intensify<br>um some of the neighborhoods around like<br>the central uh city rail link stations<br>um which was quite interesting because<br>like<br>obviously<br>we've never seen like<br>anything of that scale in new zealand<br>before and like we're trying to like<br>picture how everything's going to work<br>together and how to create like a<br>nice neighborhood for people to actually<br>want to live in yeah you know we're<br>dealing with the kind of the existing<br>problems but at the same time we're<br>thinking about the future ones like<br>you know electric cars you know or<br>automations in urban automations and<br>this kind of things as well so how we<br>can deal with this because cities will<br>because planners they are kind of the<br>multitasks people isn't it yeah so they<br>can do it for like urban design type of<br>jobs they can be like a transfer planner<br>infrastructure planner urban economists<br>you know and also consulting process so<br>it's a range of the things you know<br>options for them and different<br>organizations it's a private and public<br>sector but for the ones that are coming<br>to this program in the planning program<br>um during the time they can because we<br>cover range of the issues<br>and urban issues and the dimensions<br>um and then<br>different roles they can play at the end<br>and different options you have they can<br>find the best<br>job you know work for them in the future<br>i came into this degree thinking i'm<br>really interested in transport planning<br>now i'm thinking about something<br>completely different um<br>so do you see this among your classmates<br>as well you know the shift you know yeah<br>definitely i know a few people they<br>know<br>exactly what they want to do and they're<br>working towards echo but a lot of a lot<br>of us<br>we might not know a lot about everything<br>when we come into university and like<br>after a couple years we suddenly kind of<br>like have like<br>this different perspective on the world<br>and we're trying to<br>yeah like do something that can fix the<br>problems<br>so what do you think what how you<br>distinguish yourself from the architects<br>i feel like<br>we're not just looking at one specific<br>thing we're looking at how it all<br>again connects together and<br>how it affects like<br>people and<br>the community as a whole and what like<br>benefit and cost it will have<br>we have a lot of overlaps you know with<br>architects and also engineers as well<br>but the<br>especially with the architects uh the<br>main difference we have they look they<br>mainly focus on the one project or maybe<br>a site you know and so the skill is<br>quite different from<br>what what what we are doing and the kind<br>of the level of the pro problems we are<br>dealing with because we most of the time<br>we are speaking about the neighborhood<br>level that's a kind of the smallest type<br>of level we are speaking and then we are<br>going to the kind of the city level you<br>know so this scale of the pro problems<br>and<br>as you're absolutely right the<br>connections between the the problems you<br>know and the complex is quite different<br>you know so we don't have a client<br>like architect you know most of them are<br>working with the communities we are<br>working for local governments and<br>interest groups there which is quite<br>different from architects there most of<br>the time they are working for you know<br>private companies or a kind of<br>particular type of client and uh and<br>even for communities but it's kind of<br>smaller file but for us the scale is<br>different and the level of service we<br>provide is quite different from that<br>because they're supposed to fix the<br>issues based on the building built<br>environment the arc will shape and<br>create that built environment<br>so the tools they have is quite<br>different from us<br>we have that kind of things in the urban<br>urban design type of projects but we<br>have other tools like plans and policies<br>which is quite different from the tools<br>they have yeah so the nature of our work<br>because we become more and more<br>urbanized we have more<br>problems in cities so we need to deal<br>with it and it's the role of the<br>planners around urban planners and<br>policy makers and urban designers<br>actually to<br>this this kind of the complex issues so<br>the people they really like to find<br>solutions we are problem solvers somehow<br>and uh so if you really like to become<br>the kind of the problem solver in your<br>community in your city and help your<br>city and<br>even<br>nationwide you know uh planning would be<br>a good option for you it's it's a huge<br>responsibility for uh to become atlanta<br>because a kind of the bad plan or a kind<br>of wrong decision as a policy maker will<br>address the impact on your community<br>your city and your nation and in your<br>environment and not just the immediate<br>one it will be the the consequence would<br>be quite long<br>so in in that case you need to be<br>ethical and moral about what you are<br>doing and if you really like this kind<br>of atmosphere<br>i think new uh<br>planning would be the best option for<br>you we have a range of the options for<br>you guys you know when you graduate uh<br>you can be a<br>kind of urban planner working for a<br>private sector or a transfer plan<br>infrastructure planner working on the<br>consulting uh and also urban design so<br>it's basically the range of the option<br>you will have<br>and also you can work for the private<br>sector and public sector we have a very<br>good market you know because as i<br>mentioned that we have more and more you<br>know problems and unfortunately cities<br>but it seems it means that actually we<br>have more job opportunities for planners<br>yeah so it's it's a growing type of you<br>know discipline what do you think<br>what kind of the motivations you had to<br>come and join us<br>i feel like as a young fellow because<br>it's quite interesting i want to<br>understand this i feel like if you're<br>slightly interested in social justice or<br>like if you like to get political<br>um about you know<br>the issues like the big debates<br>um i think planning might<br>might be worth your consideration<br>because like you're obviously<br>playing a real part in changing all<br>those things and like<br>if you're interested in those i feel<br>like yeah<br>let's see<br>which was the kind of motivation you've<br>had yeah i mean i was um<br>i still am like very interested in<br>finding<br>like<br>things that will mitigate climate change<br>and like<br>actually just provide a better future<br>for<br>everyone and<br>that was my goal coming in and i don't<br>feel like that's changed</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
