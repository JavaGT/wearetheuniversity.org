He uri tēnei nō <br>Waikato-Tainui, Ngāti Tahinga. <br>Ko Alyla Hoeta tōku ingoa.<br>Kia ora, everyone. My name is Ayla. <br>I’m from Waikato-Tainui. That's <br>my hapū and my iwi (tribe).<br>And I'm a lecturer in the Design programme<br>at the University of Auckland.<br>And my main kaupapa, or my main paper that I teach<br>is Identity, Indigeneity and Place.<br>And then I also help co-teach <br>on other papers such as  <br>Design and Creative<br>Communities and Design Methods.<br>What my kaupapa (philosophy) is really <br>about is bringing mātauranga Māori into <br>our design practice and weaving in some <br>of our tūpuna (ancestral) knowledge<br>into how we navigate design as <br>practitioners and people connected to <br>Tāmaki Makaurau and living in this place.<br>And so that's important for me to <br>not only bring it into the papers  <br>that I'm helping to teach but <br>also across the Design school.<br>So, kia ora.<br>About five years ago I returned <br>from my post in Germany <br>to start my own design practice in New Zealand<br>which is still going today, called Mass Design.<br>And when I heard about this school starting,<br>a design school with a new vision,<br>really looking at the future of <br>our society and thinking about <br>the question of what kind of designers do we need,<br>I was very interested and started talking about,<br>you know, being a part of this conversation.<br>And when the school started, <br>I had the opportunity to join.<br>Since I started with industrial <br>design because I loved art <br>and I loved graphic and visual expression<br>and it was super technical, <br>industrial design in Argentina.<br>And I learned how to make <br>all these amazing things.<br>but then, after working for a while I wanted more,<br>and I was very privileged to get a <br>grant to study at Politecnico di Milano <br>which is a very good design school in Italy.<br>And there I studied something really new<br>that was called Product Service System Design.<br>So, it told us that design goes beyond products<br>and it goes over to services and experiences<br>and you connect all that through systems thinking.<br>And it happens that that kind <br>of mātauranga, of knowledge,<br>is very useful for trying <br>to tackle global problems.<br>So, very complex problems like the<br>environmental ones.<br>So, I ended up shifting from product making into <br>trying to use design methods <br>for environmental problems,<br>And because I had to learn more, <br>I ended up doing a PhD on <br>environmental engineering.<br>So, I feel like I have both sides of the story.<br>So, I have the most expressive, emotional, <br>empathic side that design brings,<br>and then I have the technical <br>side that engineering brings.<br>Right now, what I do at the <br>University of Auckland is<br>I do mostly design for sustainability.<br>That has a very strong social-cultural <br>part that it's called Social Innovation.<br>So, I teach a paper called Creative Communities<br>and that's one of the core papers of year two<br>that teaches designers to <br>be facilitators of change.<br>So, you'll learn how to run a workshop and how to<br>empower groups of people, to empower the community<br>to find solutions to their own problems<br>through a creative process.<br>Then I teach another paper called <br>Design and the Natural Environment <br>and in that paper, we go a <br>bit beyond sustainability,  <br>and we go into<br>environmental conservation.<br>That is a big field in New Zealand.<br>So, environmental conservation is <br>a field that is quite conservative <br>and there is, right now, we're in the right <br>time to look for innovation on that area.<br>So, design methods can help conservation.<br>And also because I love animals, <br>and I'm a diver, so I love diving.<br>So, right now, our students are going to be doing  <br>marine restoration<br>and regenerative tourism this year.<br>So, that's an exciting topic to explore.<br>And then I teach Design <br>Impacts at the masters level, <br>and that's a more technical paper where we get to<br>explore the ways we plan for impact and<br>how we measure and track impact.<br>So, like carbon related things <br>and also, cultural impacts.<br>So, that's mostly my design journey and<br>we really hope to see you here.<br>Kia ora. I'm Diana Albarrán González.  <br>I am a lecturer and Deputy Director of <br>Design here at the University of Auckland.<br>And we have two students <br>with us today, Rikka and Jed.<br>I'm Rikka Ly.<br>I went to Northcote College, and I did <br>art design, project design, <br>calculus, statistics and English.<br>Hi, I’m Jedediah Solomon. <br>I went to Macleans College<br>and the core subjects I took were <br>design and visual communications,<br>and design and digital technologies, <br>amongst math, English and physics.<br>The reason I chose to go to university here  <br>was because of the broad conjoint<br>programmes they offered.<br>I particularly had a passion <br>for design, of course,<br>and computer science and this conjoint <br>allowed me to get the best of both worlds.<br>I think like most people I used <br>to think design was nothing more  <br>than a coat of paint you put <br>on at the end of a project.<br>Something that makes the product look <br>visually appealing for customers.<br>And it wasn't until I started coming <br>to uni and started learning more <br>about the design process and the <br>tools and techniques behind it<br>that I understood design as  <br>more of a problem-solving method <br>and more as a way of thinking,<br>rather than something to just <br>make it look visually appealing.<br>What was your first week like?<br>If you think back on your <br>first approach into university, <br>what are the things that really stood out<br>and mark your experience <br>here that you can remember?<br>I think the culture. It's something...uni <br>culture is something that shouldn't <br>surprise you. I didn't really <br>think about it that much.<br>My first week at uni in Design <br>there were a lot of icebreakers, <br>and usually icebreakers, they're <br>supposed to break the ice,<br>but usually they don't really go anywhere.<br>But the people at design are... <br>they're really, they're great.<br>And there are some people that I met <br>through the icebreakers that I’m still... <br>they've just ended up being <br>the best friends to date.<br>And even people that aren't <br>my really close friends, <br>I’ve just had great chats with them,<br>group project experiences or <br>just experiences outside of uni.<br>I got an internship through one of the people <br>that I didn't actually talk <br>to her in the first week,<br>but through the design degree <br>and getting to know the people <br>and getting to know them a bit <br>more you get opportunities.<br>Like, for example, she was like, "I <br>have a friend who wants an intern."<br>"You do computer science and design."<br>And I was like, "Oh, yo!"<br>And then I interviewed and he liked <br>me and so I became an intern there.<br>And then a girl that I met in first year,<br>she was an exchange student,<br>went back to Taiwan in the second year, I think,<br>because of Covid.<br>But we call every single week,<br>every single week on a Sunday,<br>and she's one of my best friends.<br>And I just, I don't think I could <br>have gotten that in any other degree.<br>I think that just the people <br>in design are just different.<br>For me, the main learning I’ve had <br>so far in the Design programme is <br>I don't need to box myself in as a designer.<br>It's more than just focusing on UX design.<br>It's more than just focusing on graphics design.<br>Instead, even though I am an individual,<br>I can work on a multitude of projects,<br>and that learning has been enforced by the <br>numerous papers we are offered here to take,<br>whether it's business design, digital <br>design, working in virtual reality.<br>Topics I never thought I would have <br>even thought of working within before, <br>there's now things that <br>not only am I interested in  <br>but things I actually have <br>the opportunity to work in.<br>Like if we talk about activities as you asked,<br>what activities have I done that really <br>enforced this is being able to go out <br>there in the real world and <br>work on a multitude of projects.<br>I’ve been blessed to have the <br>opportunity to work in everything from <br>web design, as we discussed earlier,<br>to 3D modelling, working in <br>VR, working in game design,<br>and even to working on a robotic arm,<br>which is something I never considered in my past.<br>And the Design programme's broad optional <br>papers has allowed me to see that <br>my future as a designer doesn't <br>need to be boxed to one name.<br>And I guess going forward when I graduate, <br>I’m still not sure what I want to do, but I know <br>that there's a multitude of options out there.<br>Being in control of a project and being able <br>to direct where it leads and where the people  <br>need it, I found that that's important to me.<br>And at the moment, I am working <br>in a bit of a professional...  <br>well, a professional<br>context.<br>I work for a startup named Say My Name,<br>and we we make sure that international <br>remote work is a little bit easier by  <br>promoting name pronunciations, <br>correct name pronunciations.<br>and I’ve brought my social work into <br>that but also, I realised some of the...<br>some of the things that we use in the<br>Design degree and the planning<br>like Miro, Notion, design frameworks, <br>they use that in there too.<br>And just joining this startup <br>has made me realise how important <br>the design frameworks that design teaches us are.<br>One of the things that I love personally<br>about design is that it could be very<br>trans-disciplinary.<br>So, that means that you work with people <br>with very diverse backgrounds and expertise.<br>We have so many conjoints.<br>So, we have, like, Design and Law,<br>Design and Computer Science, like yourselves,<br>Design and Engineering.<br>There's so many possibilities and we have 11<br>different conjoints.<br>So, thinking about this, how has this influenced <br>your experience in the Design programme,<br>as being as conjoint students?<br>What are the benefits or <br>the things that you really <br>feel that have benefitted you <br>from doing a conjoint degree?<br>Design at its core is not something <br>that can be done in isolation.<br>It's not something like science where <br>you can just continue to pursue science.<br>Rather, it is a field where you have to work with <br>others, and it thrives when you work with others.<br>It's not a matter of you can't be without others, <br>like, a single person can still <br>complete the whole design project,<br>but they still utilise skills from other fields,<br>such as for us with computer science.<br>You need to be able to not <br>only make something look  <br>nice but also make it a reality, <br>which is something I really enjoy.<br>Not being able to just, <br>you know, make a prototype, <br>a sketch that looks great,<br>but that point when I bring in my <br>computer science skills from my conjoint.<br>I think there's so many different conjoints here  <br>and a lot of them were things <br>I never considered before,<br>like Design and Law was not really <br>something I even thought of being valid,<br>but once we started going into <br>group projects I was able to  <br>work with people that took these conjoints and <br>I was able to see how valuable it really was and<br>because we work in such an environment, it's like  <br>even though I don't particularly <br>want to focus on that skill,<br>I’m able to rely on those that <br>have trained in that skill <br>and see how I should best <br>interact with them going forward,<br>especially in my work career because <br>everyone has their own unique language,<br>especially doing computer science, <br>we're always talking about bits  <br>and bytes and whatever nonsense there is, <br>whatever terminology buzzwords there are.<br>And every conjoint has a bit of that.<br>And this environment where we found <br>ourselves in is an environment that <br>helps us to best prepare <br>ourselves for the real world.</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
