a<br>really a great pleasure to be here at<br>the celebration of Peter Adams promotion<br>to professor and I must say these are<br>um of all the tasks I have these<br>most people wants to be involved in<br>these events and as you're probably<br>aware we've had quite a disruption over<br>the last few years with covert<br>and a lot of these inaugural<br>professorial lectures we have had<br>canceled or put off and so it's great to<br>be back in the swing of things in fact<br>we've got four this week alone three in<br>Dunedin and one in in<br>Christchurch so it's it's wonderful to<br>be back and of course we have them we're<br>beaming them online as well as in person<br>so I think it's increased the<br>um the ability of people to attend which<br>is fantastic<br>my main role is really just to um to<br>welcome everybody here today and I know<br>we have welcome everyone here who's here<br>in person uh welcome everyone who's<br>joining online either live or later on<br>those part of the The Wider university<br>community<br>Dunedin Community but especially<br>um one one to acknowledge Peter his<br>whanau and friends and I gather today we<br>Peter's parents Jeff and Helen Adams are<br>here wonderful<br>Peter's partner Tony and Son Owen I<br>think are also here one to see you here<br>sister Jillian and partner Richard and<br>then I understand that maybe joining by<br>live stream from Wellington Peter's<br>daughter Harriet and then maybe brother<br>from Sydney joining um<br>but the live stream as well so welcome<br>to everybody great to have you here<br>now I'm going to leave it to to Anthony<br>to give a more detailed<br>um uh introduction to Peter and Peter's<br>biography but I guess I just um always<br>like to see if there's some point of<br>contact I think the main point of<br>contact that I have with Peter is the<br>fact that a large proportion of my<br>family go to his Summer Schools every<br>year I hear about them repeatedly and<br>I've never attended that I hear a lot<br>about them and they're clearly highly<br>highly successful<br>um uh congratulations Peter on this<br>really well deserved promotion<br>um I'm somebody who can't imagine living<br>without music and so I'm really really<br>Keen to hear your lecture today very<br>much looking forward to it and I'll hand<br>over to to Anthony to give a bit more<br>yeah Kira Koto everybody and um it's<br>lovely to be introducing<br>my old friend Peter Adams to this oh<br>so used to these things that you forget<br>about them uh it's been it's lovely to<br>be introducing my old friend uh Peter<br>tonight<br>for his IPL I've been colleagues with<br>Peter for over 30 years and we've shared<br>the common interests of composition and<br>conducting I first encountered Peter in<br>the National Youth Choir way back in<br>1979<br>when the choir first started sadly I<br>didn't get to know him at that point<br>because the choir was very tribal you<br>either belong to the Christchurch tribe<br>or the Dunedin tribe or this<br>um however a few years later I got to<br>see him conduct the Christchurch Youth<br>Orchestra he may not be aware of this<br>and I remember thinking at the time<br>there's a sprightly intelligent looking<br>character with a fine head of hair<br>thanks<br>and a few years later I moved to Dunedin<br>to become Mozart fellow and so began a<br>long friendship with Peter who was an<br>assistant a research assistant at the<br>time in the music department<br>and he's been an integral part of what<br>was the music department and has become<br>the School of Performing Arts since the<br>1980s he made an outstanding<br>contribution both as a teacher and a<br>musical leader he's really been the glue<br>that's held the Department's curriculum<br>together over three years of change and<br>I'd Hazard a guess that he's possibly<br>taught more on more papers than anyone<br>um he's played pivotal roles in music<br>technology music theory composition<br>music history music Aesthetics and I<br>could go on<br>he's been important uh conduit for our<br>wind and Brass performance students<br>himself being a top quality clarinetist<br>who could have had a career as a<br>professional performer should he have<br>chosen that path<br>he's had important leadership roles in<br>the school and a style has always been<br>collaborative no fuss getting the job<br>done efficiently and effectively<br>um his knowledge of degree structures<br>and course approval is second to none I<br>am constantly amazed Harry calmly<br>answers any inquiry I have about a<br>student path<br>his cheerful nature is much appreciated<br>by the staff and the students and he's<br>always willing to help he helped out<br>last year when I was uh when I was Ill<br>so he's very a collegial person<br>he's also open-minded by nature and<br>happy to explore new options and way<br>back in the 1990s he was a willing party<br>to developing the music technology<br>stream which as it was called back then<br>which has become a very important<br>pathway for us now known as music<br>production<br>Peter's been a major figure in the wider<br>music Community he's well known<br>nationally and internationally as a<br>conductor in the Brass Band world for<br>highlight being a tour to China with the<br>National Youth Brass Band<br>he's also led the local Saint Kilda<br>Brass Band becoming national champions<br>his concerto for violin and brass band<br>was a world first in 2007. very unusual<br>combination<br>Peter's also worked for the Dunedin<br>Symphony Orchestra as a conductor and<br>clarinetist the city choir he's<br>conducted New Zealand secondary schools<br>Dunedin youth he's had a big role with<br>young people over the years and he's<br>been a Mainstay of the waitaki music<br>Summer music school for many years<br>I think it's also Peter's generous<br>nature that's greatly appreciated he's<br>very willing to give his time to fellow<br>musicians so much so that on occasions<br>he's had to be in two places at once but<br>this is a skill that musicians develop<br>as they get older<br>in recent years his composition gained<br>the recognition it deserves via<br>performances recordings and Publications<br>including recordings with rattle records<br>he's not been one to push his own Barrow<br>but he's written some top quality works<br>that could stand alongside the best that<br>aotearoa has to offer<br>um I remember some years ago driving<br>home at night and hearing some beautiful<br>music on the radio and I thought gosh<br>that's subtle and nicely scored and<br>simple rich and it turned out to be<br>Peter's quartet looked to the far<br>Horizon which I think we might hear a<br>little bit off tonight<br>and uh Peter's music demonstrates some<br>distinctive qualities uh Southern<br>identity I think in my opinion a certain<br>understated quality with evocations of<br>landscape and culture from this part of<br>the world<br>however it also Springs from an<br>intellectual tradition that appreciates<br>music for its own sake and for its<br>scientific foundations as Peter will<br>explain Peter feels strongly that the<br>best music is not simply entertainment<br>or a comfort blanket it engages with us<br>intellectually and emotionally and is<br>essential part of Being Human<br>hence the title of his talk tonight why<br>Music Matters to me and why it should<br>matter to you<br>Peter will take us far back in history<br>and demonstrate the important role that<br>music has played and philosophy and<br>learning Her Imagination is a key<br>element in music's function and how is<br>life and music connects with these ideas<br>so we look forward to it greatly Peter<br>now and<br>um now I'm just going to ask the staff<br>the School of Performing Arts to come<br>down and we're going to sing our school<br>word<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>Maori<br>kayakanui<br>uh okay I<br>foreign<br>welcome to you all especially to my<br>colleagues to my family to my friends to<br>The Wider university community to the<br>music musical community of Dunedin I<br>really appreciate your attendance and<br>support tonight thank you very much<br>Kiora<br>I'd like to begin with a quote from Paul<br>McCartney in music there's a lot of<br>magic in what we do there's a lot of<br>mystery that you can't explain<br>and he's right there's so much that is<br>mysterious about music is it a language<br>and if it is what does it say and how<br>does it say it<br>I know of no other substance or artifact<br>that we respond to intellectually<br>emotionally sensually and physically in<br>equal measure and all simultaneously<br>the beat and Rhythm makes us move and<br>dance harmonies touch us emotionally<br>the brain perceives patterns hierarchies<br>organization and as we will see music<br>especially feeds our imagination<br>we know that music is universal<br>it's been part of human culture for many<br>thousands of years<br>the first instruments we know of were<br>simple bone flutes discovered in Germany<br>dating from 43 000 years before present<br>the exact origins of Music remains<br>obscure though with commentators in<br>disagreement over whether it Rose before<br>or after or simultaneously with the<br>origins of human language<br>most cultures have their own mythical<br>Origins concerning the invention of<br>Music generally rooted in their<br>respective mythological religious or<br>philosophical beliefs<br>so if we're unsure when music began we<br>seem just as unclear about music's<br>function so let me talk about that a<br>little bit because we live in a society<br>that puts music into the Arts and<br>entertainment section of the newspaper<br>and actually serious music has very<br>little to do with entertainment in fact<br>it's almost the opposite<br>music works on the imagination it's an<br>art form that's perceived by the ears<br>and not the eyes and this is a vital<br>distinction<br>the brain does not hear music as<br>representing something in the way it<br>does visually with Visual and literary<br>Arts so we can't compose music Anthony<br>and I and others that is a tree a nude<br>or a teapot<br>music bypasses the representational and<br>it inhabits the world of what<br>schopenhauer called the inner experience<br>or the imagination<br>Plato and the ancient Greeks called it<br>the soul<br>so let's trigger your imaginations for a<br>minute I'd like to begin with some music<br>the piece that Anthony actually was<br>mentioning the opening of my 2015 string<br>quartet looked to the far Horizon it's<br>performed by the Jade string quartet of<br>Auckland recorded on a rattle record CD<br>entitled parlor games<br>this music does not represent anything<br>the word I like is evokes I hope this<br>music will evoke certain moods and<br>certain characters It Might Recall<br>associations with places Landscapes<br>other music every listener will have<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>I think I was thinking of bleached Skies<br>when I wrote that and I was also setting<br>out the ingredients of the piece in<br>those opening minutes<br>well the first people to really<br>understand how Music Works were the<br>ancient Greeks<br>the Greeks said that music and astronomy<br>were two sides of the same coin<br>astronomy was seen as a study of<br>relationships between observable<br>external objects and music was seen as<br>the study of relationships between<br>invisible temporary hidden internal<br>objects within us<br>Plato himself devotes substantial<br>attention to music in both the Republic<br>and laws conceiving of music as an art<br>that can bypass reason in the intellect<br>and penetrate into our innermost self<br>impacting even the constitution of our<br>character<br>to use Plato's two terms music acts as a<br>charm on our inner life shaping this<br>life to its pattern<br>and I think Shakespeare also had insight<br>into this charm of Music the famous<br>passage from The Merchant of Venice the<br>man that hath no music in himself nor is<br>not moved with Concord of sweet sounds<br>music and astronomy found themselves the<br>basis for the quadrivium the upper<br>division of the medieval education in<br>the liberal arts which consisted of four<br>related subjects as they saw it<br>arithmetic geometry music and astronomy<br>number of course being the common<br>denominator amongst these subjects as<br>I've said astronomy looks out at<br>observable near ageless phenomena the<br>stars and the planets that have been<br>there for an eternity while music looks<br>inward at invisible perceived with the<br>ear not the eye remember temporal<br>internal objects within us<br>the quadrivium curriculum LED people to<br>see the relations between things<br>helping to overcome the old opposition<br>between Humanities and Sciences the<br>physics and Mathematics of the natural<br>order of things the natural world<br>underpins both music and astronomy as<br>Pythagoras of course showed<br>music is as much a science as it is an<br>art and therefore you can understand why<br>a university is a university when we<br>have such subjects in the curriculum<br>music intersects and balances the<br>relationship between the humanities and<br>the sciences and as Plato saw it the<br>four areas of the river of the<br>quadrivium each contribute to the<br>formation and ordering of what he called<br>the soul and this this Mysterious World<br>of inner experience and Imagination that<br>music feeds and why to me it is so<br>important and matters so much<br>here in the music program of this<br>University we focus not just on the<br>study of music but on the practice of it<br>it's one thing to think about music<br>historically and culturally to describe<br>it and to analyze it and we do that of<br>course but to practice music is what has<br>happened for centuries and that's what<br>we try to do here help our students in<br>the practice of Music my friends and<br>colleagues in the School of Performing<br>Arts are practitioners distinguished<br>performers composers songwriters and<br>producers<br>and I do what I do make music and assist<br>others in making it because it turns out<br>it's the thing that I seem to be best at<br>being visually impaired with the genetic<br>eye condition retinitis Pigmentosa I<br>can't trust my eyes as much as I can<br>trust my ears although my partner would<br>probably disagree with that statement<br>and she would say that I have that<br>music is a language that has always<br>spoken very clearly to me the paradoxes<br>that it's not translatable<br>but it provokes and it stimulates the<br>imagination that is in its way as<br>my own practice started as a young boy I<br>came from a musical family my parents<br>loved music my father was a Hi-Fi buff<br>and the stereo would be on with a<br>Catholic mix of classical jazz and<br>popular musics everything from Sydney<br>beche to Jean Sebelius to Carly Simon<br>there has been research to show that<br>exposure to music in the first five<br>years of life is crucial to the<br>development of musicality and this<br>saturation in music was crucial I think<br>for my sisters and myself<br>my uncle Glenn was a world-class Viola<br>player he became principal Viola of the<br>New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and then<br>moved over to the London Symphony<br>Orchestra in the days when it was<br>conducted by Andre Previn<br>my parents encouraged my sisters and<br>myself to learn instruments the girls<br>took up violin and so of course I had to<br>do something different I took up the<br>clarinet and saxophone<br>nearly always the first foray into music<br>for most of us is through performance<br>creating music as a composer or<br>songwriter seems to come later learning<br>the language of Music first through<br>practice on an instrument or through<br>singing underpins creativity<br>in our family this exposure to music<br>bore fruit my sister Jillian was an<br>accomplished violinist who later sang in<br>choirs the youngest Miranda is a<br>professional violinist associate concept<br>Master of the Auckland philharmonia<br>Orchestra my parents are here tonight<br>Jeff and Helen Jeff whose Long career at<br>the in the newspaper took him to editor<br>of the otago Daily Times a mum who had a<br>very long nursing career<br>and I want to thank them particularly<br>for their support and their<br>encouragement of all of our families<br>music<br>and for always checking also that we<br>kids did our practice<br>thank you<br>growing up here in Dunedin I started<br>claring it with where's Faulkner a<br>wonderful Dunedin musician who used to<br>be the musical director of the capping<br>shows<br>I showed an aptitude for the instrument<br>and quite quickly so lessons often<br>consisted of us playing through of all<br>things Iris jigs as well as sight<br>reading most of his Jazz Arrangements<br>my best friend was Trevor Coleman some<br>of you will know Trevor he has a dma<br>from this University of Emmy nominated<br>composer well he and I were grew up<br>together in Saint Claire he lived around<br>the corner we hung out together all the<br>time and we both learned instruments at<br>Saturday morning music classes in the<br>early 1970s we entered into the Caroline<br>Bay Talent contest in Timaru<br>this was our first ever public<br>performance preserved here for posterity<br>in this Photograph we were very excited<br>to go through to the finals we were<br>shouted fish and chips for that feat<br>what Masterpiece did we play<br>Trevor and I both attended King's High<br>School where we came under the influence<br>of the very charismatic music Master<br>Peter Warwick who also also taught<br>history he might have taught Tony<br>Valentine actually and I'm not sure<br>he was the epitome of cool long-haired<br>and owner of a Ford Capri posters of<br>which adorned the music room walls<br>he identified talented musical boys as<br>third formers and took us out of art<br>class and gave us extra music<br>essentially hot housing this little<br>group and guiding us to school<br>certificate and then University entrance<br>music he ran a school orchestra in a<br>brass band and he was instrumental in<br>developing my passion for music<br>having a musical family around me and<br>having completed bursary music at school<br>the idea of becoming a musician didn't<br>seem strange in fact I never really<br>considered any other career path so I<br>studied music here at otago University<br>and did an honors degree in clarinet<br>performance and in composition<br>the department as it was then in those<br>days was small but thriving under the<br>professorship of John Drummond<br>John Jack Spears Patrick little and John<br>Barker nurtured my musical interests and<br>inspired and motivated me to continue my<br>music<br>I found that I enjoyed composition<br>at University and an early piece sings<br>Daphne that set the words of Janet frame<br>from owls do cry one the Philip Neal<br>Memorial prize and composition<br>by this time I'd been playing clarinet<br>in the Dunedin Youth Orchestra and then<br>the Dunedin Civic Orchestra as it was<br>called in those days and I had been<br>teaching it the Saturday morning music<br>classes there the music director the<br>human Dynamo that is Art brusser<br>um asked me to assist him in conducting<br>the senior Orchestra and this was my<br>first step into conducting an area that<br>I've embraced for over 40 years through<br>to the present day you'll forgive me but<br>I was conducting a brass band from<br>invercargill in the otago Southland<br>championships on Sunday and I'm<br>conducting the local Saint Kilda Brass<br>Band in a concert this coming Sunday<br>um art brusser taught me the galvanizing<br>value of energy and enthusiasm if we are<br>contagious with these it rubs off onto<br>our students onto our musicians and onto<br>people who we deal with it's always been<br>my philosophy to have that energy and<br>enthusiasm<br>my undergraduate degree had exposed me<br>to performing composing conducting and<br>to Contemporary Art music and now the<br>time had come to think about<br>specializing<br>most of my musical friends went overseas<br>to continue their performance studies at<br>music conservatories and I was tempted<br>to do this but I had also decided that I<br>wanted a broader musical career in a<br>University Music Department if possible<br>Jack Spears was my role model as a<br>lecturer here he was able to continue to<br>mix conducting performing on his<br>instrument composing teaching and<br>analyzing music and I consider myself<br>extremely fortunate to have been taught<br>by him and then to have been sort of his<br>replacement in a sense and to be able to<br>Commonwealth and William georgetti<br>scholarships took me to London and<br>King's College where I did a master's<br>degree in music theory and in analysis<br>the 80s were a bit of a wild time and uh<br>I want my colleagues to particularly<br>note the hair<br>long gone<br>and also the appalling taste in mustard<br>colored clothing<br>that was the 80s for you<br>this master's degree gave me the tools<br>to penetrate beneath the surface of a<br>piece of music to understand its<br>organization its cellular growth and its<br>coherence all very useful and score<br>preparation as a conductor and later for<br>tertiary level teaching<br>I remained in London for nearly five<br>years I began a PhD at Kings on the<br>chromatic Harmony of Frederick delius<br>wonderful composer but I got put aside<br>as my freelance career gained some<br>traction I conducted a choir of former<br>music students in London played clarinet<br>freelancing in many little ad hoc<br>orchestras that were put together to go<br>out and accompany the many Coral<br>societies scattered around the south of<br>England and I also taught some clarinet<br>and saxophone in several schools<br>in the summer of 1982 and 1983 I<br>attended the famous dartington Summer<br>music school where I spent an intensive<br>Fortnight studying composition with<br>Peter Maxwell Davies and conducting with<br>John Carew<br>John Carew was the teacher of Simon<br>Rattle so he had a good pedigree if you<br>like Max as he was known was something<br>of a cult figure in the British<br>contemporary music scene and his classes<br>were very stimulating but also<br>intimidating his intense glare would<br>often put you on the spot as he waited<br>internally for an answer to a complex<br>question<br>my Sonata for clarinet and Viola was the<br>result of my study with max written in<br>1983 for New Zealand performers in<br>London that I had known back in New<br>Zealand through the National Youth<br>Orchestra clarinetist Rachel Vernon and<br>violus John Rogers it was premiered at<br>New Zealand house on the Haymarket the<br>work was quickly recorded a year later<br>back home by Radio New Zealand<br>the extract I want to play you now was<br>recorded more recently in 2015 as part<br>of the ReSound project a project<br>re-recording New Zealand works of<br>importance and it again features my good<br>friend Rachel on the clarinet and the<br>late Peter Barbara Barbara on viola the<br>work is both lyrical and angular<br>dissonant and expressionist reflecting<br>the early 1980s the time it was written<br>and the influence of Peter Maxwell<br>Davies<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>that's rather like looking at an old<br>photograph in which you don't quite<br>recognize yourself<br>that's not a long long time ago and<br>almost a different language to me<br>that New Zealand House Performance of my<br>Sonata was one of the first occasions<br>that I had taken out a young English<br>woman Tony plant<br>as a rock chick she was not very<br>impressed with my piece and my dissonant<br>modern musical language but she<br>continued to go out of me nevertheless<br>so I was a winner in 1987 we returned<br>together to Dunedin I had some part-time<br>work at the University and as an<br>itinerant woodwind teacher in schools<br>along with some private music teaching<br>the sort of portfolio musician actually<br>that we are training our students to<br>become today<br>we settled and in 1990 I began my full<br>full-time career here at the University<br>after getting the position of assistant<br>lecturer in music the very first rung on<br>the academic ladder in those days<br>here is my application photo taken by<br>Tony<br>as you can see I was doing my best<br>brooding intense look<br>if I could<br>1990<br>at this University no internet no email<br>no cell phones the vice Chancellor Robin<br>was truly a pleasure for me to work<br>alongside my previous teachers here in<br>the department and to be part of a very<br>significant transformation in music<br>education led by John Drummond as we<br>first embraced the academic study of<br>popular music and I can remember<br>Elizabeth Kerr denouncing this on Radio<br>New Zealand that universities would soon<br>be studying popular literature<br>heaven forbid and other things and then<br>after popular music we brought in our<br>courses on music technology and then<br>finally of course courses in<br>contemporary Rock performance and<br>songwriting introducing the first<br>contemporary popular music degree in the<br>entire southern hemisphere in 2000 we<br>should remember that everyone's copied<br>us since and go anywhere and learn<br>electric guitar but in 2000 we were the<br>first in the whole Southern Hemisphere<br>and one of the only about a dozen in the<br>world<br>so the 1990s were an extreme extremely<br>busy time for me I'd returned to Dunedin<br>when uh when several long-standing<br>Community organizations were actually<br>looking for musical Direction<br>very quickly I found myself conducting<br>the city choir to Eden That Was Then<br>known as The Scholar contorum the<br>Dunedin Youth Orchestra and the Dunedin<br>Symphonia as the Dunedin Symphony<br>Orchestra was then known orchestras and<br>other centers wanted my services and in<br>the Saint Kilda Brass Band came knocking<br>on my door an association that's<br>continued to this day after that<br>operatago came to the party and I<br>frequently found myself out three or<br>four nights a week rehearsing while<br>working here by day and bringing up a<br>over my career I seem to have conducted<br>more than 400 performances with<br>ensembles that range from youth<br>orchestras to choirs professional<br>orchestras to Brass bands opera<br>companies to musical theater groups<br>all this tells you as I find it hard to<br>say no<br>as Anthony mentioned I especially like<br>working with young people and I've also<br>really enjoyed leading 14 annual waitaki<br>summer music camps organized by my good<br>friend Paul Clayman and Professor Tim<br>Wilkinson<br>let's take a moment to look at this<br>practice of conducting<br>for many years my primary research was<br>my professional practice as a conductor<br>and a conductor in performance of course<br>has got one of the most visible jobs in<br>the world but despite this many people<br>are rather baffled but what they<br>actually by what they actually do what<br>difference does the conductor making<br>answering that question is difficult<br>because conductors do so many things<br>both on and off the podium in fact the<br>role of the conductor is always evolving<br>how we think of a conductor now didn't<br>develop until the early 20th century<br>long after Mozart Beethoven and bark had<br>passed<br>there are plenty of stereotypes and<br>surrounding conductors they're<br>dictatorial egotistical<br>mysterious old elitist almost<br>exclusively male<br>however these stereotypes are<br>increasingly out of date there are now a<br>growing number of female conductors new<br>zealanders leading the way in this<br>regard with our own ex-student Holly<br>matherson prominent and Gemma new just<br>appointed the first ever female musical<br>director of the New Zealand Symphony<br>Orchestra<br>there's also been a lot of important<br>work done recently to disrupt and dispel<br>these stereotypes conductors will not<br>get away with abuse rudeness or<br>negativity they are one Cog in a complex<br>machine that goes to making a satisfying<br>performance<br>and in the 21st century they need to<br>work collaboratively and collegially<br>with their fellow musicians<br>and to illustrate this here is a clip I<br>show my conducting students I ask them<br>what is happening here what's going on<br>and I apologize it's fairly low quality<br>thank you<br>foreign<br>answers from my students and some will<br>tell me he told them to deliberately<br>come in on my fourth rebound<br>others will say no he started before<br>they were ready and so on<br>but finally we actually get to the point<br>this conductor has done something to<br>upset this Orchestra you might have<br>noticed they weren't smiling none of<br>them were tapping their their bows or<br>applauding as he entered<br>and therefore they don't actually come<br>in when he directs them to they make a<br>fool of them Beethoven five opens with<br>that famous three note motive and it<br>comes after a rebound after literally a<br>vigorous kickoff papa papa<br>can you imagine the sock of not having<br>that rebound<br>when you expect it and he's left<br>floundering this Orchestra we're<br>reminding the conductor where the real<br>it's a great lesson for all of us<br>so at a basic level conducting is very<br>simple the time keeping aspect keeps an<br>orchestra or a choir in time and<br>together<br>regulatory gestures control Dynamics and<br>balances looks and other gestures Q<br>players for entrances after many bars of<br>inactivity and so on but that's just the<br>starting point<br>most importantly a conductor serves as a<br>messenger for the composer it's their<br>responsibility to understand the music<br>and to convey it through gesture so that<br>the musicians in The Ensemble understand<br>perfectly<br>those musicians can then transmit a<br>unified vision of the music out to the<br>audience many individual voices as it<br>were becoming one unified voice<br>in the 18th century conductors and<br>leaders used a big staff that they would<br>pound on the grout to keep musicians in<br>time this was quite effective in one<br>sense everyone could hear it but then<br>the composer Lolly stabbed himself in<br>the foot<br>got gangrene and died<br>so people began to look for a better way<br>to do it<br>so nowadays conductors use either a<br>baton or just their hands there are many<br>set patterns and gestures which<br>communicate key features of the music<br>universally understood over the years<br>the job has developed into something<br>which is primarily artistic to integrate<br>the musical interpretations of all the<br>musicians on stage into a bigger picture<br>so the conductor develops their gesture<br>to shape the music a skill which<br>involves psychology body language<br>knowledge of music history and style a<br>sensitivity actually to everything that<br>makes us human<br>it's a bit more than just waving your<br>whistle the conduct S as a sort of guide<br>and teacher we rehearse to play the<br>music well and in a unified way<br>especially when it's new or difficult<br>and then when something goes wrong it's<br>the conductor's job to spot this and to<br>fix it and many things can and do go<br>wrong in rehearsal a section may not be<br>playing together very well the<br>percussion all the brass may be too loud<br>or people come in early or late or they<br>don't come in it at all at all reminds<br>me of the old joke<br>you know why do Viola players never go<br>to parties<br>yes it's pretty bad I know<br>the older jokes tend to be each piece of<br>music has many decisions that have to be<br>made about it for example the tempo or<br>speed of the music and how it changes<br>how fast does allegro Lively printed on<br>the front of so many first movements of<br>Classical period works is it the same<br>speed in each piece that we see that<br>word written<br>no it's not other decisions we might may<br>conclude the subtleties and volume<br>across dozens of musicians thus Forte<br>loud mean the same thing to a violinist<br>as it does to a trumpet player<br>and Dynamics aren't just a volume<br>control and a loudness<br>they have a character or a mood<br>associated to them is this piano soft<br>volume tender or is it intimate or is it<br>Dolce sweet<br>is this Forte loud dynamic organ-like or<br>laser-like blazing or<br>one letter changed blaring<br>the pacing of tension and release<br>through a piece where does the tension<br>lead to where does it resolve itself<br>these are all decisions we are looking<br>and trying to make<br>so these are what we investigate while<br>preparing to conduct a piece much like<br>painting a picture the conductor begins<br>with a vision and it then executes their<br>craft to the best of their ability to<br>make it real<br>the orchestra can play without them but<br>every Orchestra member will play it<br>differently the conductor considers<br>every oh don't turn two pages<br>foreign<br>yes I have sorry<br>okay there it is<br>conductor considers every aspect of the<br>music and how to make it as inspiring<br>and faithful to the composer's<br>intentions as possible then they work<br>with the orchestra to make a unified<br>Vision come alive<br>there's a symbiotic relationship between<br>composer performer and audience<br>imagination is a key word here a<br>successful piece of music requires at<br>least three different imaginations and<br>intellects brought together the composer<br>brings their imagination and craft to<br>the construction and notation of the<br>piece the performers bring their<br>imagination and craft to the realization<br>of that construction into sound the<br>listeners audience bring their<br>imagination into and attention to the<br>performance hopefully allowing the music<br>to take them out of themselves in some<br>way<br>as I said earlier if music in the<br>auditory system do not convey<br>representations of objects and if we<br>can't make translations of any<br>particular piece into English or any<br>other language then what is a piece of<br>music saying<br>well actually I think that is the wrong<br>question and I don't think we should ask<br>it<br>the best I can do is just perhaps<br>suggest instead that we ask what does<br>the music arouse within us and let us<br>say to ourselves<br>and there I go again that Greeks<br>internal inner experience that Plato was<br>looking to the far Horizon that title of<br>that 2015 string quartet is rather an<br>apt metaphor for my compositional output<br>playing the long game and awaiting the<br>arrival of things that seem distant and<br>far away for many years that distant<br>Horizon was where I looked for four four<br>performances and recognitions of my<br>compositional activity it always seemed<br>to play second fiddle to my teaching<br>conducting and other performing<br>activities and then in that<br>serendipitous way that life does these<br>things you find that what was on the<br>horizon has actually snuck up on you and<br>it's now right under your nose<br>the last eight years have seen quite a<br>dramatic increase in performances and<br>recordings of my work<br>I compose at a fairly slow pace perhaps<br>just two or possibly three works are<br>completed in any year<br>but most of my work has now seen the<br>light of day through performances and<br>recordings<br>Anthony's mentioned my concerto velasca<br>for violin and Brass Band it was the<br>idea of our violin lecturer at the time<br>Kevin lafon<br>and it's funnily enough although it's<br>got this crazy idea of balancing brass<br>instruments and percussion with an<br>acoustic violin the work's actually been<br>performed in Dunedin Auckland Portland<br>and the United States and recorded in<br>2009 on a CD<br>as well<br>I've also written two larger works for<br>orchestra one of which we'll hear an<br>extract from in a minute in a minute two<br>string quartets three works for<br>symphonic wind band many chamber works<br>for smaller ensembles<br>so my music is abstract in the sense<br>that there's no program no story behind<br>it other than what I try to evoke as<br>there's that word again in terms of<br>moods and characters and then what the<br>listener brings to the music with their<br>imagination and all the associations and<br>resonances that that music might have<br>with them<br>there's not much mystery about making<br>something from a recipe<br>but much remains to be said I think<br>about the process of originating some<br>new ideas in the form of musical<br>composition<br>creation is not just a matter of getting<br>into some sort of excited mental state<br>as in a brainstorming session for<br>instance but it seems to be me to be a<br>much more complex mysterious process<br>that is in some way of course derived<br>from the composers inner experience and<br>Imagination<br>composition mixes creativity with craft<br>technique is necessary to manipulate<br>ideas create a structure make sure that<br>every detail belongs in the work<br>imagination and the creative Force are<br>the vision and the ideas lying behind<br>the piece and then these find their<br>outlet and specific maladies harmonies<br>and rhythms<br>as composers we create a new and<br>Innovative recipe for ourselves for each<br>new work and then we set about cooking<br>putting together this process of using<br>our experience and understanding to<br>create new works that will hopefully<br>provoke the listener's interest<br>so I'd like to play you now my final<br>extract from my orchestral work hurry<br>our Prelude and variations for orchestra<br>composed in 2010 and the beginning of<br>2011 a scheduled performance in 2012<br>fell through and the work remained<br>unheard of and unheard until out of the<br>blue it was programmed by the Dunedin<br>Symphony Orchestra in 2018 with a former<br>student Declan Evans conducting<br>and you will also see my colleagues<br>Tessa Peterson leading the orchestra as<br>concert master and Helene de plessis<br>leading the cellos in this extract<br>the workers inspired by the huriyawa<br>parasite on the karatane peninsula the<br>landscape Cliffs blowholes seas and<br>skies<br>and this extract is from the Middle the<br>music is a temporal art it unfolds over<br>time and this entails that you listeners<br>do not experience the whole work at once<br>nor in an order of your choosing<br>consequently the order of presentation<br>is fundamental to the experience of the<br>musical content and these facts are born<br>in Mind by us composers we try and<br>create purposeful goal-directed movement<br>this extract illustrates this I hope<br>here I take you the listener on a<br>journey beginning with a gentle cluster<br>Harmony and a solo oboe played by my old<br>friend Nick Cornish through a growing<br>dialogue with the other woodwind<br>including Professor Stephen cranefield<br>on clarinet who I taught as a lad<br>funnily enough<br>and then it grows into a full orchestral<br>Tutti with the theme growing into a more<br>impassioned cello Melody<br>and this is what I mean about the<br>composer directing The Listener over<br>time in a purposeful way in live<br>performance you have no choice but to<br>experience this music in the order of<br>presentation that I have made with<br>structures and relationships that I<br>develop over time<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>One Last Time back to the Greeks let me<br>give you a final example of how I think<br>music reaches those places that words<br>and other things can't describe one of<br>the most profound musical compositions<br>of the last 100 years is the Couture<br>palafanda top quartet for the End of<br>Time written by French composer Olivier<br>messian in 1940.<br>I was lucky enough to perform this piece<br>with Terence and other colleagues in the<br>early 1990s and I still teach it as a<br>400 level class and use techniques from<br>this work in composition teaching<br>messian was just 31 years old when<br>France entered the war against Nazi<br>Germany he was captured by the Germans<br>imprisoned in a concentration camp where<br>a sympathetic prison guard gave him some<br>manuscript paper and a place to compose<br>the toilet block<br>there were three other professional<br>musicians in that camp and messian wrote<br>his quartet with these specific players<br>in mind it was performed in January 1941<br>to 4 000 fellow prisoners along with<br>some guards standing in Sub-Zero<br>temperatures in the freezing winter<br>today it is one of the most famous<br>Masterworks in the repertoire<br>given what we have since learned about<br>life in concentration camps why would<br>anyone spend their time and energy<br>writing or playing music<br>conditions as a captive were horrendous<br>and yet from these concentration camps<br>we have poetry we have music we have<br>visual art it wasn't just this one<br>fanatic messian many many people created<br>artworks<br>it begs the question why<br>well in a place where people only<br>focused on the bare necessities of<br>survival the obvious conclusion is Art<br>and music is essential for life<br>the camps were without hope without<br>dignity without basic respect but they<br>were not without art and music<br>art and music is part of survival it's<br>part of the human Spirit an unquenchable<br>expression of Who We Are the Arts are<br>one of the ways in which we say I am<br>alive and my life has meaning<br>and this is not just for the producers<br>of art or the performers who bring music<br>and Stage Arts to life but it's also<br>necessary for the audiences who receive<br>it<br>from my own experiences I have come to<br>understand that music is not a luxury a<br>lavish thing that we fund from leftovers<br>of our budgets nor is it a play thing or<br>an amusement or a Pastime music is<br>actually a basic need of human survival<br>music is one of the ways we make sense<br>of Our Lives one of the ways in which we<br>express feelings when we have no words a<br>way for us to understand things with our<br>hearts when we can't with our minds<br>music allows us to move around those big<br>invisible pieces of ourselves and<br>rearrange our insides so that we can<br>find an outlet and express what we feel<br>when we haven't the words and can't talk<br>about it<br>referencing Plato one last time<br>I'm a cynic by inclination but I believe<br>that with music and art you could yet<br>Perhaps even save the planet<br>if there is to be a future for Humanity<br>if there is to be a settled time of<br>Harmony of Peace of an interwar of<br>mutual understanding of quality of<br>fairness<br>I don't expect it will come from a<br>government a military force or a<br>corporation<br>it probably won't come from the<br>religions of the world either which<br>together seem to have brought us as much<br>War as they have peace if there is a<br>future time of Peace for Humanity I<br>expect it might actually come from the<br>composers and artists because we feed<br>that inner soul and in the end that's<br>what we've always done and that's what<br>I have been privileged to work with<br>wonderful colleagues<br>ours is a vibrant school and Performing<br>Arts with truly creative people and I<br>have been very happy here throughout my<br>career I really want to thank the<br>academic and general staff in the School<br>of Music Theater Performing Arts for all<br>their support collegiality and<br>friendship over the years<br>I really very much want to thank my<br>family for all their support as well and<br>finally my thanks to the university for<br>its support<br>over many years and for showing faith in<br>what I do it's very much appreciated and<br>a final shout out to the many musical<br>organizations and musicians here in<br>Dunedin especially but in other centers<br>thank you<br>otago<br>um as my in my role as the pro Vice<br>Chancellor for the Humanities I have the<br>honor of providing the vote of thanks to<br>Professor Adams this evening<br>and I wanted to start with a personal<br>anecdote and that is that um at our<br>graduation ceremonies I have the<br>pleasure of sitting next to the pro-vice<br>chancellor of Sciences<br>and in one of my first ceremonies as the<br>PVC in that role just after we had had<br>the pleasure of listening to a musical<br>item from one of the students who I<br>think in that scene was accompanied by<br>Professor Terence Dennis<br>and several times since he has<br>emphasized to me and to other members of<br>the University's management team just<br>how important music and the Performing<br>Arts are<br>in tonight press Adams I wanted to<br>recognize the able argument that you put<br>forward that music is both science and<br>humanities<br>and that music doesn't just entertain us<br>and isn't simply about entertainment but<br>it's far more important than that that<br>it opens up different ways for us to<br>think and to see the world it enables us<br>to interact with each other socially<br>emotionally and cerebrally<br>in the first half of your lecture it was<br>a real pleasure I think for all of us to<br>listen to your story of your upbringing<br>and your musical education and how you<br>came to where you are today<br>and in the second half of your lecture<br>you took us more closely into your<br>discipline itself<br>and you described the art and the<br>science of both the conductor and the<br>composer and I found what was so<br>interesting in your discussion of both<br>of those roles a clear call and I<br>suppose a composition of what it is to<br>be an academic in whichever discipline<br>we find ourselves in so as a conductor<br>you talked about the skill of the<br>conductor lying in the sensitivity to<br>everything that makes us human<br>and I think all of us and all of our<br>Fields would hope that in some ways we<br>do that too and perhaps how jealous we<br>are that you get to do it most cleanly<br>and then as composer you talked about<br>the composer's role<br>being to evoke ideas and feelings and to<br>reflect the place and time in which the<br>composing is being done and again I<br>would say that I hope that's something<br>that all of us as academics and those<br>who are involved in the University find<br>that we are engaged in I also wanted to<br>just make two points to you Peter<br>personally one is and I think I say this<br>on path of your colleagues as well how<br>much I appreciate and I think they<br>appreciate your commitment to your<br>organization to be organized to be<br>thorough to be unflappable and I know<br>that Professor Richie mentioned that in<br>relation to the crucial support you<br>provide the school and course advice and<br>program leadership and I just thought<br>I'd share with you that<br>ipl's as we mentioned in the beginning<br>are a regular feature particularly this<br>year in our calendar and I ask for the<br>draft lecture of each of the IPL that I<br>have to that I have the pleasure of<br>thinking afterwards and in most of them<br>it's about like a student handing an<br>assignment<br>comes in very late and normally very<br>clearly it's draft Jess it's just a<br>draft<br>and 99 of the time when I'm listening it<br>certainly was the draft because what was<br>presented was not what I got which it<br>was mine because I end up I end up<br>getting to read or hear two great<br>lectures<br>but in the case of Professor Adams not<br>only did what he give me<br>um<br>represent almost almost to the to the<br>letter what he delivered to you but it<br>came in I think almost five minutes<br>after the request went out for it so<br>Bravo<br>and then secondly um I want to pick up<br>on something else you said in your<br>lecture and that was<br>um<br>the admiration you have for those who<br>can demonstrate the energy and<br>enthusiasm for music<br>and um I'm probably giving away too much<br>but before the lecture Peter was telling<br>us about how frustrating it was to be<br>restricted to a script in the way that<br>he normally isn't when he's in front of<br>a class as many of us uh you know we can<br>we can go off script but in an in an<br>event this important it's really<br>important to have your script with you<br>and he sort of was expressing how<br>frustrating that was well I wanted to<br>say that regardless of what might have<br>felt like a restriction Peter you were<br>nevertheless incredibly entertaining in<br>a good sense and also your passion and<br>your enthusiasm came through loudly and<br>clearly and so I'm very jealous of all<br>of your students because I imagine they<br>have a wonderful time<br>so I want to say Peter to you that I'm<br>really glad that at otago it was decided<br>somewhere in the midst of time that in<br>our University we would seat music and<br>the other Performing Arts<br>withinui the division of humanities even<br>if that makes the PVC Sciences slightly<br>jealous<br>so thank you thank you Peter for<br>choosing to be a musician but thank you<br>also for choosing the university path<br>when you could have chosen others and<br>yet you chose to combine it with your<br>musicianship as well so<br>a small gift is a token of appreciation<br>and Remembrance for this evening thank<br>you congratulations</p></main><footer
