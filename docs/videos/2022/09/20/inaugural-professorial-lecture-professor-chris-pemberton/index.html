do<br>this by celebrating it and a professor<br>Chris Pemberton way<br>it's<br>I think that's the first time I've been<br>for those who don't know me my name's<br>David Murdock the the vice Chancellor of<br>the University of otago and I'm really<br>glad I got through that last sentence<br>because the Temptations Standing Here is<br>to say Dean and head of Campus so I got<br>through that<br>um big welcome to everybody<br>um this is the a very special occasion<br>as Caesars indicated uh this is the the<br>celebration of Chris pemberton's<br>promotion to Professor and really this<br>is one of my great Pleasures the great<br>pleasures of my role is to take part in<br>in these inaugural professorial lectures<br>and there's as you're probably aware<br>we've put off a lot of them being very<br>disrupted by the covert pandemic we're<br>now catching up<br>Chris is the fourth this week and it's<br>really been wonderful to be able to hear<br>from our academics from all over the<br>university and now we have them live<br>streamed and are recorded and you can<br>watch them afterwards so I really<br>encourage you I know coming from a<br>Health Sciences you tend to focus on<br>Health Sciences but I really encourage<br>you to look around at the other ipls<br>that are happening at the moment and and<br>see what a amazing<br>colleagues are doing around the<br>University<br>my main role is to welcome everybody and<br>so big big welcome to everyone who's<br>here everyone who's joining online<br>either live or delayed<br>and I know coming from The Wider<br>university community but also the wider<br>Christchurch community and Beyond<br>but but special<br>um acknowledgment to Chris's uh whanau<br>and and friends and I think here today<br>we have wife Megan<br>and uh daughter Rebecca<br>uh friend I think friend well jacinta is<br>here I think Mike count was now unable<br>to join him maybe joining later and also<br>I know there are quite a few other<br>whanau and others who'll be watching<br>online so big welcome everyone it's<br>really wonderful to have you here today<br>to take part in this wonderful event<br>and before I hand over to Richard Gary<br>who's going to give more detail about<br>Chris's background really just a<br>personal note Chris we've known each<br>other a while and I really have<br>you know enjoyed all the interactions<br>we've had over the years enjoyed your<br>enthusiasm and passion for your research<br>but also just really want to acknowledge<br>that you are one of our staff and<br>scientists who have a very good<br>commercial Instinct and I'm sure you'll<br>be uh reflecting on that and part of<br>your talk and that's something that is<br>University scientists don't often have<br>in fact it's it's uncommon and you<br>certainly have had that instinct<br>throughout I guess throughout your<br>career certainly the career that I've<br>known uh so congratulations<br>um this is really a well-deserved<br>promotion really looking forward to the<br>lecture and I will pass over to Richard<br>one<br>uh it is my absolute pleasure to<br>introduce Chris Pemberton to you all<br>today although if you're here you<br>probably don't need much of an<br>introduction to him because you're here<br>to support him to celebrate the amazing<br>work that he's done over such a<br>prolonged period of time David just said<br>that this is one of the best things he<br>does on his job this is the best thing I<br>do in my job is depart as head of<br>Department because really the the the<br>the the how well the department does its<br>successes are reflected in its people<br>and today we have one of the great<br>people when the department coming<br>forward and I've known Chris for a long<br>time I think we've been around the<br>department probably for a similar time<br>and I think even I fled with someone who<br>is a research assistant with him way<br>back at the very start of this uh of<br>this journey so really a lot of stuff<br>has been going on over a long period of<br>time and he makes up one of the really<br>important aspects of the Christchurch<br>Heart Institute which is a really strong<br>uh group in our department in the school<br>and the university as a whole so it<br>reflects that as well so here's the<br>biography to tell you all about him and<br>what he's been up to so Chris began his<br>research at the University Canterbury<br>where he completed a masters in animal<br>physiology majoring in neurophysiology<br>he then spent 14 months at Lincoln<br>University trying to coax deer into a<br>research study holding pen<br>but he gave up and came to the<br>University of<br>otago in Christchurch to do his PhD<br>under the guidance of professors Espina<br>and Yandel<br>after completing his PhD on the<br>biochemical forms of BNP and<br>experimental heart failure he took his<br>family to the farthest place away from<br>New Zealand in the world that was to<br>Finland where he gained postdoctoral<br>training and isolated organ techniques<br>and making angels in the snow to<br>celebrate PhD celebrations so we can't<br>do that today I'm not quite sure if<br>angels in the dirt really work quite as<br>well as in the snow<br>upon his return to the Department of<br>Medicine at University of otago in<br>Christchurch he established one of the<br>and he established the isolated heart<br>facility at the Christchurch Heart<br>Institute led by Professor Mark Richards<br>and using this facility both as a<br>research Discovery tool and<br>physiological testing platform the main<br>focus of Christmas research has been the<br>discovery of ice of circulating factors<br>in the blood that could potentially be<br>used to address areas of unmet clinical<br>need and the diagnosis and measurement<br>of patients with cardiovascular disease<br>in 2011 he was awarded the health<br>research Council Lily medal I just<br>wanted to pause there because the lady<br>middle was one of the most amazing<br>Awards you can get from the ehrc for an<br>amazing breakthrough this is not just a<br>career of research but one piece of<br>something a breakthrough so for Chris to<br>get that from our from our school here I<br>think is an amazing achievement I just<br>like to to Really acknowledge that here<br>and he currently heads the translational<br>biodiscovery laboratory and is a member<br>of the senior leadership team of the<br>Christchurch Heart Institute he's also a<br>chief scientific officer of the<br>diagnostic company Upstream medical<br>Technologies which he co-founded in<br>2015.<br>so Chris's talk today will cover a wide<br>range of study areas including going<br>right back to his Masters and will<br>include caterpillars and attempt to<br>rewrite a small part of textbooks how to<br>tell someone how to tell if someone has<br>a dodgy coronary arteries and a bit of a<br>side hustle involving covert Chris thank<br>you very much you're very welcome to<br>come up here and tell us about your<br>amazing career date thank you<br>can you hear me<br>that's a shame<br>um<br>so we have prestigious Maori Dean it's<br>Merry language week and apparently I'm<br>the first person to wear this cloak no<br>pressure<br>a VC Prof Murdoch profitable Prof priest<br>Prof Geary<br>Oklahoma<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>I'll cut toy<br>apologies<br>that was awful um thank you for tuning<br>up<br>um I know you're here for the food but<br>you've got to listen to me for the next<br>30 to 40 minutes so I would just like to<br>say it's nothing personal but I really<br>enjoyed rolling you all<br>um that was something I wanted to do for<br>a while so I'm going to talk about what<br>I've done and the people who are most<br>important in the time that I've spent<br>here at the Fantastic Institution<br>so the first biology lesson that I got<br>was that trout are worth catching<br>I got that from a very young age the<br>second one I got was that dogs are great<br>mates and will drink beer but they're<br>absolutely useless at digging ditches<br>um<br>going to school well that was not very<br>good and the only person who really<br>understood me was my French teacher who<br>wrote Chris would do a lot better if he<br>stopped chatting in class and I think<br>that's quite a Common Thread among a lot<br>of students at that time and we all<br>start out with bright ideas and a fresh<br>new bag and looking good and then<br>somewhere along the way it all tends to<br>custard and you end up looking like that<br>that was at the end of year swimming<br>Sports at school<br>um going to University<br>um that was a lot of fun and we had a<br>great group of people in my masters<br>cohort really smart intelligent<br>fantastic people and as per usual it all<br>tend to cast it on Saturday night and<br>what's really scary is that this guy<br>here was learning how to fly Skyhawks<br>for the New Zealand Air Force and he's<br>probably taken a lot of people around<br>the country on a 737 or something now so<br>that's that haunts me still to this day<br>so caterpillars that's the first part of<br>it and as a bright-eyed student<br>the project that I undertook in<br>neurophysiology was to figure out what<br>the piranha moth larvae don't like to<br>eat and the piranha moth are those<br>really big moths that fly around in the<br>spring they're really annoying birds<br>love them because they're very tasty but<br>the larvae are actually quite a big<br>problem and they're a big problem at the<br>time it was worth tens of million<br>dollars of lost agriculture because they<br>would get into the grass and they would<br>literally you could go into a paddock<br>and you could lift it like carpet they<br>would just ruin everything<br>but the best things about it that really<br>intrigued me was that you've got a free<br>Apple computer from the dsir and there<br>was six thousand dollars of working<br>expenses<br>and that's them there these little<br>critters that live in the soil and they<br>basically eat away like the the grass<br>scrub and other things as well<br>um and they've got to face only a mother<br>could love<br>um<br>and that's the scanning electron<br>micrograph of what they look like<br>because the first thing we had to do was<br>figure out well how do these things<br>sense what's around them to know what to<br>eat<br>so we took a lot of pictures on the ECM<br>mug shots like this<br>and it's these things here so this is at<br>the end of its antenna and this is on<br>its mouth around here<br>and these things are actually sensory<br>organs<br>so there's quite a few of different<br>links on the antenna and there's quite a<br>number of different arrays at the um on<br>the mandible and in the maxilla as well<br>and the way that they're structured is<br>that they have a hole at the top or a<br>pore and you've got these axonal<br>projections which run along here down to<br>the exons and they taste literally the<br>whatever's in and you can have these as<br>a a fluid sensory or an ear sensory<br>system as well and you can visualize<br>these with a stain called methylene blue<br>and it's probably not as apparent but<br>you can see the blue exons here and they<br>extend up to there so it's a selfie of a<br>a bug bug tooth<br>um and then the primary reason once<br>we've done all this anatomical<br>assessments the next thing we wanted to<br>do was well what do they like to eat can<br>we figure out what they don't like to<br>eat<br>and to do that you had to record it<br>using all these electrodes so you had a<br>a glass filled per pit and it had a<br>um a sodium chloride in silver chloride<br>electrode in it and you could change<br>whatever you wanted in the fluid and<br>that electrode and you put it over the<br>maxilla and you could and measure<br>whatever you wanted and it was in the<br>setup here<br>and you could have the recording side so<br>you basically cut the head off the<br>caterpillar and put it in a base of<br>sucrose and that would keep it alive for<br>a couple of hours and then you put it<br>all through an amp and it would go<br>through another quad amp to an<br>oscilloscope and you could record it and<br>put it onto the amazing Apple computer<br>that we had and you could also put it to<br>the speaker and there was a PhD student<br>who was looking at uh another insect at<br>this time in the lab and we figured out<br>that we could reroute the speaker to<br>play whatever we wanted you could dampen<br>down the signal from your experiment and<br>play music through it and when the<br>supervisor was actually there of course<br>we had to play something that was you<br>know suitable he was okay with that but<br>when he wasn't there it was more like<br>that<br>um that was a lot of fun<br>and So eventually by the end of it we<br>worked out the structure of what the<br>caterpillar's sensory organs were like<br>and then we thought okay the what are we<br>going to put into them to see what<br>happens and the very clever people at<br>the dsir who were funding the project<br>had worked out that there's this thing<br>called Faison which is quite common and<br>and it's quite abundant in legumes and<br>beans and things like that and then the<br>caterpillars don't eat the beans<br>and they worked out what the structure<br>of this thing was and for the chemist<br>it's a terracapan derivative<br>isoflavonoids to the non-chemist it's<br>just the thing with a whole lot of rings<br>on it<br>and you could get a different structure<br>it tastes awful<br>I'm not going to say how we found that<br>out but it tastes awful and what<br>happened was that we would put this in<br>this solution with a whole bunch of<br>different things in the caterpillars<br>they really loved sucrose and fructose<br>but the big thing that they loved was<br>phenylalanine<br>and if you put 0.1 mole of phenylalanine<br>on and you had the recording you can see<br>all the impulses going off crazy like<br>here if you add the Faison disappeared<br>it was gone and we thought this is<br>pretty cool we found something they<br>don't like so then the whole idea was<br>you could naturally breed it or<br>genetically introduce phasiolin into the<br>grass and you would perhaps reduce their<br>preference for feeding it and this is my<br>first introduction to how bureaucracy<br>can affect science because then at that<br>point the DSi completely restructured<br>all that work was lost and it went off<br>into something else and so that was the<br>first lesson learned and this is a book<br>I used to read as a kid about a<br>Schoolboy called Nigel molesworth and a<br>rule of life there's only one thing in<br>cricket and that is the straight back<br>keep your bat straight nor will be right<br>in life as in cricket but when my batter<br>straight I still get bold<br>is that a moment so have a slosh you're<br>going to get bold but it's much more<br>satisfactory to go out in the blaze of<br>glory<br>so at that point you have a masters and<br>and things are looking pretty good and<br>you think this is quite good I want to<br>carry on but I got distracted<br>um<br>didn't I yes<br>um and I went off to Lincoln as a lot of<br>people here have done the number of<br>people actually here in the medical<br>school who in some phase or form have<br>gone through Lincoln is incredible I<br>went to work for Prof ground Burrell<br>looking at deer antlers and the whole<br>interesting thing about them is that<br>deer grow antlers in the summer and then<br>they run around but then they take all<br>of that<br>um bone growth and um what's the word<br>ossification everything and they put it<br>back into their skeleton so the whole<br>point of that project was if we can<br>figure out how they do this then maybe<br>therapeutic treatment options available<br>um for osteoporosis or things like that<br>and so the structure of the deer antler<br>they have all these different cells<br>you've got<br>um I can't see it here I'm going to put<br>these on this is what happens when you<br>become a professor you need glasses<br>um you know they've got these reserved<br>mesenchymals or stem cells here at the<br>top at the end of the antler and you've<br>got all these other different cell types<br>and so we were sampling from the neck<br>veins to try and get through a<br>representative<br>sample of what was going on inside these<br>antlers now that only lasted for about<br>12 months because<br>while having the deer in the crates like<br>that photo shows you only use Hinds<br>because they're much more pliable and<br>you get in there with a stag and it's<br>all over and you had to come from behind<br>the Stag and the Hind and put your hand<br>over the eyes like that and of course I<br>was the guy who had to do this and that<br>was usually the result<br>and so after several repeated statements<br>from deer and some fairly highly acute<br>inflammatory responses from you know<br>where I thought now that I've had enough<br>of this<br>and ended up going coming to to<br>Christchurch and at that time<br>well around the city was the reputation<br>of professment and Tim meandl as real<br>gung-ho these are the this is the team<br>you want to work for that was a parent<br>so<br>I came in and I presented myself and<br>they must have seen something useful and<br>they agreed to take me on as a PhD<br>student for which I'm eternally grateful<br>um<br>so the question at that time was was BMP<br>now the Christchurch talks a lot about<br>BNP we know a lot about it<br>um and the problem that they had at the<br>time was that it was emerging as a<br>potential cardiac marker and it's it's<br>been a market now for a number of<br>decades now and it's released from the<br>heart<br>um in response to increased wall<br>pressures and stress and hypoxia as well<br>can make a release and it does this and<br>there was a big problem at the time<br>patients with heart value they would<br>come in and they would have breathless<br>symptoms but how could you tell the<br>diagnosis apart and that was a tricky<br>thing and BNP was emerging at that time<br>as a potential solution to the problem<br>it's now in the guidelines this is from<br>the European Society of Cardiology it's<br>their guidelines and you can see here<br>that BMP NT Pro BNP it's a class one<br>level of evidence it's a class one<br>recommendation with the level B of<br>evidence so it's it's fairly well<br>ingrained in the um in the guidelines<br>but it wasn't at the time and there were<br>some issues that we that we were wanting<br>to solve<br>and you had to use an animal model<br>because you just couldn't do certain<br>things to humans not even medical<br>students it was unethical<br>and so some of the questions that we had<br>was how much does the BMP biochemistry<br>form change from when it's released from<br>the heart into the peripheral<br>circulation so and as heart failure<br>develops does the production and the<br>processing change and what are the forms<br>that are relevant to the sheet model<br>because you need to know exactly how<br>your model is performing and are they<br>cleared in the same way and all of those<br>things are important because if you're<br>going to design a test or measure<br>something in the blood and it's going to<br>be useful in your model all of the<br>clinicians you want to make sure you're<br>not missing something<br>so these are the very clever folk who<br>live on the third floor they don't look<br>like trouble at all and they have their<br>very well characterized model of heart<br>failure where they basically stick<br>pacing wires in the heart and they Pace<br>it for at set rates for a certain period<br>of time and the Sheep develop<br>all the characteristics of hemodynamic<br>and neurohumeral that is hormonal heart<br>failure and it's an excellent model and<br>they're a highly skilled world-renowned<br>team for doing this<br>so the first thing I'm going to bore you<br>now with a little bit of biochemistry<br>the first thing we did was create the<br>assay and it seemed to perform very well<br>when you could measure off here this is<br>the standard curve and you can measure<br>off here what you achieve level and the<br>sample was so the first thing we're<br>trying to figure out do the do the forms<br>differ from the from the heart and the<br>circulation is it is it cleaved in some<br>way and these profiles here are just<br>size exclusion chromatography which if<br>you see this peak here which looks like<br>that and if it's if it's this end over<br>here it means it's a bigger molecular<br>weight than it would be if it alluded<br>down here and each of the peaks in each<br>of these profiles showed that the gross<br>overall biochemistry was the same there<br>weren't major changes between the heart<br>and the periphery unlike ANP which is<br>down here and you can see it's got a bit<br>more of a complex profile so that was<br>the first part of the question on a<br>gross assessment the ovine BMP forms<br>didn't change much between the heart and<br>the peripheral circulation<br>what happens when you ramp up heart<br>failure and so you ramp up heart failure<br>here by<br>increasing the heart rate you can see<br>here as it increases from 120 through to<br>225 beats per minute what happens is<br>your left atrial pressure so the<br>pressure inside the left atrium and the<br>Sheep's heart was going up the left<br>ventricular pressures were going down<br>mean arterial pressures changing and the<br>cardiac output went down as well and you<br>if you altered the heart rate the the<br>animal would respond accordingly and you<br>could have beautiful changes and so this<br>was a fantastic model for this and we<br>knew exactly what was going on in terms<br>of the model and its induction<br>and cut a long story short again more<br>chromatography size exclusion up here<br>and this is a different form of it<br>called ion exchange chromatography where<br>you can tease out what's underlying<br>under here and the only difference<br>really was this peak here this one here<br>called number four and this only<br>appeared in the Sheep who had severe<br>heart failure and in the normal sheep it<br>was just the same here so as a general<br>rule there was a slight change in the<br>beam forms that were measured across<br>heart failure but the assay still<br>detected them all so that was a good<br>thing<br>then we came to the next problem which<br>was BMP and NT Pro BNP so BNP has<br>produced um as a parent and then it's<br>cut in half and you have BNP and what's<br>called NT Pro BMP coming from that<br>and then we had to figure out how NT Pro<br>BMP performed in that particular model<br>as well and to cut a long story short<br>they have very different conference<br>concentration profiles so the<br>chromatography here is is a better way<br>of looking at it and so you can see<br>these Peaks here this is the NT probe<br>BNP and the BMP here they're about the<br>same size<br>in the same size here but when you put<br>the Sheep into heart failure the NT<br>probingp vastly outweighs the the BMP<br>and so this was<br>um an interesting point and that both<br>BMP and NT probe BNP were relevant to<br>the Sheep heart value model but<br>anti-probium he was lasting a lot longer<br>and the question is why is it doing that<br>so we went on to the next thing<br>which was are they cleared are they<br>produced or are they cleared at<br>different rates<br>and the shorter answer is we used a<br>mathematical technique for the<br>mathematicians in the room wherever it<br>is there is called deconvolution which<br>basically is a fancy way of saying we<br>know what you're doing<br>um and the whole basis behind that was<br>is we would paste the sheet and it would<br>induce an increase in both of them but<br>the BMP would drop away very quickly but<br>the NT Pro BNP would take a lot longer<br>and using d convolution by subtracting<br>because they're produced from the same<br>parent by subtracting the BMP which we<br>know the half-life you then take that<br>away from what the NT Pro BMP and this<br>is the delay curve here that we can see<br>the BMP and the amp came down very<br>quickly but the NT Pro BNP took a lot<br>longer and it ended up being about 69<br>minutes versus about four or five maybe<br>eight minutes in the Sheep here for BNP<br>so we had quite a much longer half-life<br>and this is reflected here as also<br>if you block the clearance pathway<br>for BMP so you can stop its cleavage or<br>you can stop it being<br>removed from the circulation you see the<br>BMP levels here and the normal animals<br>they're all around the 60s as soon as<br>you start blocking it it goes up and it<br>ends up at 168 rosinty Pro BMP is<br>tracking along and was quite happy so<br>that was the first evidence that they're<br>cleared from quite different Pathways so<br>this was all very good and got written<br>up in a book and that was great<br>um but it's not over so this is the<br>latest algorithm from the European<br>Society of Cardiology here and you can<br>see here patient comes in you're<br>breathless you do all the clinical thing<br>and the first thing you order that's the<br>recommendation NT probing P or BNP<br>they've both used<br>but<br>all of that biochemistry stuff I've just<br>I've just told you about it doesn't end<br>there because<br>the genetics of BNP such produced in the<br>nucleus that comes out it's cleaved<br>one's biologically active one's not<br>biologically active it's got sugar<br>groups it's glycosylated on the NT Pro<br>BMP it's got all these other different<br>things and people in our group Lindley<br>and alamander are looking at this<br>because this actually has implications<br>particularly the potentially the<br>glycosylation because big things<br>um impact on the diagnostic performance<br>of BNP such as obesity<br>atrial fibrillation things like that and<br>there may be ethnic differences which<br>are reflected in the amount of<br>glycosylation which is in here and this<br>is important so<br>um things never end they're always carry<br>on<br>so that was the second lesson that was<br>learned you come out and you've got a<br>newly minted PhD and you're thinking oh<br>I'm ready to take on the world but then<br>you realize that an essay is submitted<br>or a thesis is submitted but it's never<br>finished yours is just one thing now to<br>those who are writing up a thesis don't<br>get depressed that's not what that means<br>your thesis is important<br>um<br>but carry on so then we went off to<br>Finland and finland's a beautiful<br>country it's got the lovely Northern<br>Lights there that we took a photo of but<br>one of the drawbacks of that was that<br>you end up sending Christmas cards and<br>things like that with the real Santa and<br>we're all very excited about this this<br>chap here was very excited she was a<br>little bit nervous he wasn't interested<br>at all<br>um but they have this really amazing<br>thing you can do there and it's called<br>The Wife Carrying competition now<br>it just has to be a wife doesn't have to<br>be your wife it could be anybody's wife<br>and it was suggested that perhaps we<br>could partake of this the look I got<br>back no way<br>and she was right<br>um and but the big attraction of that is<br>you win your combined weight and beer<br>and that was the big attraction but<br>anyway all we could do was Observe<br>the reason I went to Finland was to<br>learn how to run this and this is the<br>isolated heart and so this is a red<br>heart<br>and you take it out of the animal<br>obviously and put a cannula in it and<br>then you can oops can I do that again<br>no it won't anyway you saw it beating<br>that's good and then you cannulate the<br>left ventricle so you can get precious<br>and you can Pace it here but it's you<br>can also measure the coronary artery<br>what's happening the construction or<br>relaxation of the coronary arteries and<br>it works very well just through<br>measurement up here with these cannula<br>and the pressure here so you can use it<br>to measure what's happening to the<br>relaxation of<br>or the construction of the coronary<br>arteries in the heart and that's what<br>this data here is we published on the<br>hormone called ghrelin which comes from<br>the Gap it's a gap hormone but it has<br>quite a prominent cardiac activity and<br>if you give it at the right dose and<br>dose responsive it increases the<br>constriction in the arteries over a<br>period of time or you can use it to<br>measure contractility and we would you<br>this is from Jaco pihila who was in The<br>Finish lab and he came back to<br>Christchurch into the postdoc with us as<br>well<br>and this is looking at EPO erythropo<br>Wheaton which at the time was undergoing<br>kind of a bit of Interest as a<br>cardioprotective unfortunately it fell<br>out in clinical trials but you could<br>measure the improvements there that it<br>did with contractilities such as<br>developed pressure there it would<br>increase it and then it would improve it<br>in the reperfusion phase of ischemia<br>reperfusion so that was what the model<br>was all learned about<br>then came back to Christchurch and was<br>reading a textbook and we all know what<br>textbooks are like they are the Bible<br>they are the the word and you have to<br>learn all this and they're kind of like<br>an old school teacher who says that I've<br>been here for 30 years I've always said<br>that and I'm not going to change and I<br>was looking at this one day and reading<br>it and I was looking at the paper from<br>nature that I had in front of me and I<br>thought no I don't believe that textbook<br>I'm going with the paper from nature<br>and it concerned this thing<br>called a signal peptide and a brief<br>biochemical refresher here and or new<br>for people who don't know it so when<br>you're making a protein in your body you<br>have the ribosome and your RNA and it<br>gets together with a thing called the<br>signal recognition paddle and GTP and<br>they go hey that's cool let's hang and<br>they all form a complex and it goes into<br>this thing called the endoplasmic<br>reticulum and this little bit just here<br>this little bit here is called the<br>signal peptide and it's the very first<br>bit that gets made<br>and that bit then gets chucked away and<br>that's what the textbook was saying that<br>gets once it's done that it's it's told<br>it's given all the information where the<br>proteins mean to go<br>and that's all it does and the textbook<br>was saying this and it was reading the<br>paper and it kind of I didn't the whole<br>thing didn't gel and this is how science<br>works you know things get um pushed<br>along and that hypothesis came from this<br>guy here Gunter Global who got the Nobel<br>Prize for it in the 1970s for working<br>all this out<br>so we went back to our favorite<br>molecule BNP and it has a 26 amino acid<br>long signal peptide and we thought let's<br>make an assay to it which we did<br>and so Mercury Surrey wardina did a lot<br>of this work she was a clinical<br>cardiologist<br>who spent a lot of time walking the<br>wards in the hospital in the middle of<br>the night getting blood off these people<br>who'd had heart attacks quite amazing<br>the the tenacity with which she did this<br>and so we set up an essay and measured a<br>whole bunch of<br>data and samples and this is from work<br>from swaytonia and Matt Richards who did<br>An Elegant study called the gradient<br>study where they put cannulas into<br>people who are in the Intensive and the<br>intensivist and the clinical cath lab<br>anyway they were there because they were<br>clinically indicated to be there and<br>while they had them there sway Tony and<br>Mac would take blood samples from<br>various venous bodies beds draining<br>organs and also the the arterial flow as<br>well and this confirmed what we already<br>knew that BMP or NT Pro BMP was<br>primarily coming from the heart that's<br>what this peak here means and the signal<br>peptide of it was also coming from the<br>heart but it was coming from a whole<br>bunch of other places as well and this<br>caused a bit of scratching because we<br>thought it was exclusively a cardiac<br>hormone<br>so we went to Dunedin to the very clever<br>toast and Clifton down there<br>who was a mass spec expert of renown and<br>ran the ran the facility down there and<br>so we purified out what our essay was<br>measuring<br>and what we thought was Airbnb and he<br>first thing he said to me was never<br>wastes pure thoughts on an impure<br>protein which is very good advice so we<br>made sure we had the preparation very<br>pure<br>and then we ran it through a reverse<br>phase hplc column and got all these<br>different Peaks and then he went looked<br>at all the different Peaks and it was<br>there but it had all these modifications<br>on it and so it was 142 Daltons bigger<br>than it should have been or 102 or 128<br>and he said to me this is weird I've not<br>seen this before<br>and he went and looked in the literature<br>and he said actually these things are<br>real<br>um and I'm convinced that you're<br>actually measuring what you're measuring<br>but this is a bit of a big deal because<br>this is the first time I've seen this on<br>something like this kind of protein so I<br>went okay that's great<br>so we published that and but the big<br>thing with BNP signal peptide at the<br>time was that in patients who were<br>coming in with a heart attack<br>um the markers at the time called<br>troponin and ckmb they took a few hours<br>to come to their Peak and they would<br>rise but they weren't really at their<br>Peak until say 8 to 12 hours after the<br>event BMP signal peptide Rose very<br>quickly it was up and then came back<br>down so by the time these things were<br>peaking BMP signal pictowed was<br>basically done and gone and then BNP and<br>NT Pro BNP would rise later as well and<br>it would only do it in these patients<br>who were having an Emi in this case is a<br>steamy and so this was very good and<br>this is where Siri was doing the law now<br>Siri hates having a photo taken and she<br>hated having a photo taken so much<br>even though she's now in Australia and<br>here this I dug this out this is the ABC<br>News in Queensland 2018 and they've<br>basically saved a woman's life and this<br>was a big deal that made the news and<br>she's still trying to hide behind a<br>piece of equipment here to get out of<br>the photo so if Suri watches Us online<br>I've got you now on the photo and there<br>you are<br>the next bit of work that we did was<br>patients who had suspected coronary<br>artery disease<br>and then we wanted to know how quickly<br>can this thing be turned on and off BNP<br>signal peptide that is the answer is<br>very quickly and so Siri took great<br>Delight in subjecting actual clinical<br>patients but then also members of the<br>chi to what's called a dobutamine stress<br>echo which is where you lie on the table<br>you have a whole bunch of lie lines and<br>you and you're very prone and she gives<br>you this drug called dobutamine it makes<br>your heart pump faster and then it gives<br>you a bit of atropine just to to top it<br>off and it's quite a soporific<br>experience it's otherworldly but what we<br>found was that BMP signal peptide went<br>up very quickly but other known cardiac<br>markers such as troponin anti-pro BNP<br>didn't really work but this was a so we<br>confirmed that BMP signal peptide could<br>go up and down very quickly but what was<br>really interesting to us was that the<br>high sensitive troponin tea would go up<br>even in normal people which is in the<br>blue here and they would go above the<br>99th percentile of what was considered<br>normal and so when we first looked at<br>this we Mark commented to me Mark<br>Richard said have we been giving people<br>heart attacks all this time that we'd be<br>doing and the answer is no and it's a<br>bit more complex but that confirmed that<br>BMP signal peptide was actually an<br>inducible marker of ischemia<br>the next thing we thought well okay it's<br>coming out we can measure it does it do<br>anything and we did a lot of work here<br>in isolated Red Hats and sheep and so<br>this we presented this at the European<br>Congress of Cardiology in 2018. and so<br>we did the isolated heart model where we<br>would give it as a potential therapeutic<br>before a period of 40 minutes ischemia<br>or at reperfusion only and this is<br>really more clinically relevant because<br>you don't give someone a drug before<br>they're going to have a heart attack<br>you're usually doing it afterwards<br>and to cut a long story short in the<br>isolated heart the troponin reduction<br>was massive this was beforehand it would<br>drop and then it would be released<br>afterwards believe it or not there's<br>actually believe it or not<br>um these cells actually here are you<br>know you can actually measure them and<br>count the numbers which was a fun job<br>but there was a reduction in tunnel<br>positive sand which means that there<br>were less cells that were being killed<br>and it was doing this through the<br>phosphate pathway and it was almost<br>doing it exclusively through<br>phosphorylated irk1 so you can see here<br>the blue bars getting increased as we're<br>giving an increased dose of BMP signal<br>peptide and phosphoric2 nothing was<br>at the same time there's an<br>intracellular protein called for called<br>akt and phosphorylated akt goes up it<br>automatically goes up it's a natural<br>defense mechanism that your heart cells<br>have when they undergo a period of<br>ischemia and BRP signal peptide at the<br>same doses that was turning irk1 on<br>wasn't doing anything to akt when you<br>went to a higher dose it would reduce<br>the akt and this actually fitted with a<br>lot of other observations we had if you<br>give too much of it it actually turns<br>into a deleterious<br>agent which is consistent with a<br>U-shaped curve that you see in therapies<br>and drugs<br>so then we went from the isolated heart<br>to the Sheep because we've got a lot of<br>them and we've got a very good model and<br>Chris and Miriam and others worked<br>together and they made a ligation model<br>of my cattle if it was a snare so they<br>would ligate off<br>um the artery for a period of time and<br>the sheep and then you would have an<br>infection and that's just a picture<br>there of the surgical<br>workup and so we did a number of animals<br>and the interesting thing here was that<br>it didn't really do anything to the<br>hemodynamics as it was going on and it<br>didn't really do anything on<br>echocardiography except maybe<br>a um maybe a 10 increase in the ejection<br>fraction of the hearts that received BMP<br>signal peptide afterwards<br>but then<br>in terms of the troponin we've got a<br>similar result to what was happening in<br>the isolated heart so these are the<br>achieved levels of what we were infusing<br>into the enemy you can see it's all over<br>the place and then it drops away very<br>quickly yet despite all that we got this<br>massive reduction in what was released<br>in the troponin from the hearts<br>and then the actual area of the heart<br>that was affected was the final size of<br>the in fact and the heart was reduced as<br>well it's the red versus the blue here<br>and the tunnel staying controlling again<br>the number of cells that were being<br>programmed to die was actually reduced<br>and then the caspase 3 stating there was<br>a tendency for that to be reducing<br>caspase 3 is a marker of program cell<br>death in this particular situation<br>so this was all very good and I just<br>want to acknowledge all the people here<br>who took part in that study because it<br>was quite a lot of work so we've got<br>Siri there as well and Jackie Cannon who<br>was helping with the caspase 3. prisca<br>who did a lot of the western blotting<br>and Chris and Matt who were involved<br>with the Syria when doing the um the<br>Sheep work so at the end of the day we<br>we'd shown that not only does this thing<br>circulate but it actually has biological<br>activity as well and it does it through<br>the akt and the Earth Pathways which is<br>why it got accepted into the European<br>Congress Cardiology for this particular<br>tool which was quite good and a fair<br>reflection of all the hard work of<br>everybody who've been involved with it<br>while all that was going on we had a<br>number of different essays to different<br>signal peptides being made so we had all<br>the naturopic peptides sorted out<br>ghrelin that hunger hormone I talked<br>about before insulin and EPO and we had<br>a number of Publications that came out<br>and we had all this stuff and we didn't<br>want it to end in this way so you do all<br>this work over a number of years and you<br>just get one<br>thing and everybody else all was at it<br>and at this point we had discussions<br>with otago innovation in Dunedin and we<br>set up this company called<br>Upstream medical Technologies I<br>originally just wanted to call it<br>Upstream but<br>arguments that's just law anyway I<br>relented and we called it Upstream<br>medical Technologies and this is the<br>website which is this is the updated<br>website which is about to go live<br>hopefully in the next month or two our<br>current website is a bit Naf really<br>um but that's what we do and it was set<br>up through otago Innovation and I have<br>to say you know David Christensen and<br>others from otago Innovation and Colin<br>Dawson who was there at the time they<br>were very supportive and very keen to<br>push this through which and it happened<br>and this is the extreme Upstream team<br>so we're led by um Kieran Gina who's the<br>CEO who is also a partner in Pacific<br>Channel who are a major funders at the<br>moment Jan Powell who works at ECR but<br>she had a lot of time at a company<br>called Shire In America which is a big<br>advice kind of consulting company and<br>funders and Jackie Lee from the lab<br>she's our CTO we succon Herbert Jessica<br>who is our scientist in<br>uh we want to give her a full-time job<br>if we can do it these are our advisory<br>boards so we've got Frank peacock from<br>Houston James Januzzi from Harvard mate<br>which is of course Martin tan who's an<br>ed advisor and Martin if you're watching<br>we really want to make you CMOS so<br>please<br>um call me<br>um Louise Cullen who's a colleague of<br>Martin Tan in the Ed department and John<br>Pickering who is the sky master<br>there's that word<br>um<br>consultant he does a lot of our<br>excellent statistical analyzes there's<br>Garth Hendry he's actually a graduate<br>from the University of otago and PhD in<br>Biochemistry and he decided one day that<br>sitting down a lot and writing patents<br>on other people's work was much more<br>interesting and he's actually doing very<br>well at it now he's an excellent paint<br>lawyer he lives in England so this is<br>the entire team we have working with us<br>as well David Christensen from oil is on<br>the board along with Roland and Colin<br>who are also part of Pacific Channel<br>so what do we do and this is just an<br>indication of what happens when you set<br>up a company and you think you have an<br>idea and you think it's going to go okay<br>we've got 40 issued patents<br>and we've got one which we're hoping to<br>get through that's to be confirmed but<br>if we can get that into the company<br>it'll be really great two of those<br>patents are actively leading now in what<br>we're actually doing and pursuing and<br>getting further fundraising so that's<br>just an indication you can get a lot of<br>patents but the hit rate doesn't<br>necessarily transfer into a product<br>this is from the European Society of<br>Cardiology and this is a sort of a<br>schematic of what's called chronic<br>coronary syndromes so people go through<br>life<br>and they have what's called a<br>subclinical phase where you by virtue of<br>just getting old your cardiovascular<br>risk increases we all know that then you<br>might have some kind of symptoms or<br>something like that then you might<br>actually have an event<br>and the whole point of therapy and<br>monitoring of people is to take them<br>away from this high risk red area here<br>and get them down into the green area<br>where their risk is low<br>and the whole point of what we're trying<br>to do is to provide monitoring tools so<br>that we can take people from here if<br>they're there and get them down to there<br>they sounded quite good didn't they um<br>anyway so we've got two studies that are<br>going on in<br>um this is what's called a receiver<br>operating curve here and for the sake of<br>brevity you want a line that goes up<br>here to this left hand corner and go<br>straight across and that's what's called<br>an area under the curve of one if you<br>achieve that you are you have achieved a<br>diagnostic Bliss you have the perfect<br>test and you know you can drop the mic<br>and go home you'll never get better than<br>that if you have a test that goes along<br>this orange line it's like flipping a<br>coin and you really should start looking<br>for another job<br>and what we've got here we've done 1900<br>patients from space study here in<br>Christchurch in a study called Fast<br>Track which is a multi-center study in<br>the US and we've actually what we've<br>done is we've improved this green line<br>This doesn't look like much this red<br>line to Green Line difference here<br>doesn't look like much but it actually<br>means everything it's an improvement of<br>around about 17 in specificity and I'll<br>come to that in a bit a bit more later<br>so that's for the diagnosis of unstable<br>angina in the Ed what about the people<br>who come to the Ed they're not having a<br>heart attack but the doctors still<br>suspicious about whether they may<br>present within the next 12 months again<br>our Market C is this is the regression<br>it's a significant regression it adds to<br>troponin and a history of coronary<br>artery disease or whether they're going<br>to come back again we're inching this<br>line across here this orange curve we're<br>inching it over here to the one and only<br>when you add those two hour markers and<br>troponin together are you getting<br>significant Improvement in that<br>predictive ability<br>and it also<br>correlates with people who've had the<br>history of coronary artery disease as<br>well which fits in so if you include<br>troponin our microc a patient's risk of<br>cholesterol in their age you can have a<br>good significant predictive ability of<br>whether they're going to have coronary<br>artery disease or not so that's all<br>interesting<br>this is the latest one that we're trying<br>to get into the company and hopefully we<br>can we'll see how it goes<br>and what this does is troponin tea is<br>one of the gold standard biomackers for<br>the diagnosis of Mi this thing called<br>macadee you realize I'm calling the<br>Maxine macadee because if I did I<br>wouldn't have a job this is what<br>business does to you you're allowed to<br>be vague<br>and those who are doing the work know<br>what it is but you know it's um just one<br>of those things this particular graph<br>here we took this to Barcelona<br>um two three weeks ago at a conference<br>and I presented this to the people from<br>Roche Diagnostics that our Market day<br>was actually improving the rule out here<br>so we're improving the predictive<br>probability of someone who doesn't have<br>a coronary event when the hstnt is very<br>low we're improving it from 89 to 95<br>percent<br>I showed him this and he literally<br>thumped the table and got up out of his<br>chair and he goes I've never seen<br>anything do this such a prone and tea<br>before so we found that quite<br>encouraging so hope if anyone from<br>Russia's watching call me you know<br>that's good<br>um and then this is the final this all<br>of that kind of stuff works into this<br>and this has been worked out by the very<br>very clever John Pickering and this is<br>because this is bread and butter this is<br>what he does clinical pathways in the<br>hospital if you come in this is based on<br>our 1900 patients if you come in you get<br>everything done to you at Nord hours and<br>a group of people are going to be sent<br>off because they're definitely having an<br>MI<br>and then you can get graded into the<br>next category of unstable angina which<br>is one of the next ACS conditions you're<br>worried about as to whether they're<br>having UA and you've got low risk<br>intermediate risk and then high risk if<br>you then take the Delta of our marker<br>between naught and two hours you end up<br>being able to boot out 19 more patients<br>who are at low risk and can go somewhere<br>else and you're capturing another<br>two-thirds more of people who are at<br>high risk with a ppv of 25.6 which means<br>one in four of them is actually going to<br>definitely be an unstable angina<br>and when we put this in front of our<br>Consulting board and other cardiologists<br>in Barcelona they thought this is<br>actually pretty good particularly taken<br>with the ppv there they thought that was<br>quite good<br>so this is all positive stuff going<br>forward and we're hoping to carry on but<br>I'd just like to share with you<br>um<br>experiences of getting money out of<br>private equity and Venture it's not like<br>getting money out of a grant when you<br>write a grant although the methods are<br>the same it's a business plan and a way<br>getting money out of venture capital<br>people is a totally different piece when<br>you go to the HRC or the MB even if they<br>don't give you any money<br>they know that you know that they've got<br>money<br>it's a different story here so<br>um these are the top five repeated<br>replies that have come back asking VC<br>fans and private funders the most<br>important rule for Success the first<br>thing is how did you get this number<br>the next thing is please stop don't ever<br>call again<br>then they say what get out of my<br>driveway Dean it's my children Can See<br>For the Love of God please leave and it<br>usually finishes with yes that's home<br>officer there you go so these people are<br>very very close tested and you have to<br>in in the commercial world it's all<br>about relationships and there's a phrase<br>that they use it's called the quality of<br>the money and that doesn't mean just the<br>money it means do they believe in you I<br>mean they it's personal which is a bit<br>scary isn't it anyway<br>um but once once you break those<br>barriers and they believe in what's<br>going on<br>um they will back you to the hilt it's<br>and they will follow up with money it's<br>a it's a really interesting roller<br>coaster ride<br>so next we're getting to covert<br>um everybody's sick of covert from the<br>uh from the full-on frontal lobotomy<br>that you would get here from that<br>through to staying at home you know day<br>one to five everybody knows what that<br>difference looks like and just some<br>words of wisdom from Nigel molesworth<br>again history started badly and it's<br>been getting steadily worse and I think<br>we can all relate to that in some way<br>so sitting at the those of you who heard<br>the story before I'm sorry but I'm going<br>to say it again for those who haven't I<br>was sitting at the dinner table and I<br>got a call from Richard Blakey at home<br>because we were locked down and he said<br>mb's putting out money<br>um you should try and get some of it<br>okay<br>and I wrote an email and I looked at it<br>and I thought this is great and I wrote<br>a expression of interests 17 minutes<br>later I got an email back from mimby<br>saying this is great apply one month<br>later they gave us a million dollars now<br>if anybody from MB is watching please<br>repeat that over and over again it is a<br>very efficient way of dolling them it<br>was it was an unreal experience I don't<br>think we've ever seen anything like that<br>again<br>so we got money from MB to develop what<br>which are antibody essays to measure<br>antibodies and people in response to<br>covert everybody knows what antibodies<br>vaccines the whole nine yards there so<br>we raise them in rabbits and goats and<br>then we set up our own essays and these<br>were developing our tests in the<br>recruiting patients via the nickel<br>Center<br>and that was the whole the whole shebang<br>in terms of making the tests so we make<br>the essays the measure the covert<br>antibodies we want to measure the spike<br>protein as well which is coming from<br>just not just the vaccine but the virus<br>as well<br>and then to apply existing clinical<br>tests and novel ones to see how they<br>perform we wanted to bleed up to 3 000<br>people and collaborate with anyone and<br>everyone our tests were being performed<br>on What's called the luminex machine<br>here of which Sarah is the queen<br>and we were<br>benchmarking those against the Roche<br>machine<br>so this is a very long-winded way of<br>showing what happens across Pfizer<br>vaccination so it's comparing our essays<br>and the Roche essay against people who<br>have been vaccinated and New Zealand was<br>a really unique place at that time<br>because we didn't have covert but we had<br>the vaccine so everybody was getting<br>vaccinated so we were kind of like this<br>really amazing unique incubator<br>and what happened here was that this is<br>our luminex assays and you would have<br>antibodies created to the spike protein<br>as well as to the receptor binding<br>domain of the of the virus and that<br>these Benchmark very well against the<br>Roche cobass essay where you would see<br>they set everything to zero because with<br>blessed German efficiency if you did not<br>have the condition your value must be<br>zero they've never heard of this thing<br>called interference<br>um but you would get these beautiful<br>Cubes but our essays were working just<br>as well<br>we then measured about nine we've<br>actually measured 11 but this is nine<br>different markers across the period of<br>vaccination I still don't think this has<br>been published which is why we're<br>putting this together and basically what<br>this graph shows is that for NT probe<br>and P TNT a whole bunch of different<br>markers that are used in Immunology<br>hematology inflammation studies and<br>everything getting vaccinated across<br>previous before first vaccination one<br>your second vaccination then two weeks<br>after your second vaccination nothing<br>really changed everything pretty much<br>stayed the same apart from gdf 15 which<br>in about 60 percent of individuals would<br>show some kind of differential response<br>wasn't major but it would change a<br>little bit this actually fitted fits<br>with what's coming out in the literature<br>GTA 15 it's everywhere it's used in<br>cardiovascular medicine but it's<br>actually quite a responsive marker in<br>covert biology so it's actually going to<br>um it's probably going to be used for a<br>long time coming in that setting<br>the other thing was could we figure out<br>based on what your Baseline levels of<br>certain markers were what was going to<br>happen to your vaccination it turns out<br>that if you combine<br>your fibrinogen level and super which<br>has been studied in our lab By Janice<br>two Harris<br>your Baseline level would predict so if<br>the higher the combination of those two<br>markers your four-month Roche antibody<br>level would be low but if they lower<br>they were the higher so there's an<br>inverse relationship going on there so<br>that's very small numbers but that was<br>interesting<br>the other thing that interested people<br>was vitamin D because everybody was<br>running and said hey vitamin D vitamin C<br>do all this you know you won't get<br>covered well no that's not how it works<br>vitamin C and vitamin D May assist your<br>immune system but they're not going to<br>give you immunity that's that's very<br>clear and what this showed was that<br>there was a trend<br>with your previous vitamin D level here<br>at the pre-vaccination you would tend to<br>have a higher response of your um<br>uh antibody levels to the vaccination<br>were measured by the cobass essay we use<br>this essay because it's a an indicated<br>one<br>um and your vitamin it's a slight<br>positive relationship there with your<br>vitamin D levels it's not significant<br>it's interesting and that's really about<br>it<br>so and the essays that Sarah has created<br>are very very good and I just want to<br>make a shout out here for IGA I think<br>IGA has been neglected far too much<br>because if you look at the area under<br>the curves here the clinical essays from<br>Roche and the cobest to the IBD and also<br>to the nuclear capsid protein are pretty<br>good<br>in our own IGG essay is working good but<br>IG a here is up there and<br>I'd I'd be really interested to know<br>from immunologists and and infectious<br>disease people it just seems IGA seems<br>to be the unsung hero and all this and<br>when warrants further inspection<br>now how long do antibodies last for<br>again we could do this because the<br>vaccine from Pfizer only gives you<br>antibodies to the spike protein so we've<br>got 23 people who've been vaccinated in<br>no covert and then 30 people post<br>covered in through the study and we and<br>we watched so here this is the spike<br>protein and you can see this is the two<br>week and then four month after<br>vaccination these are Decay but they've<br>got measurable Spike protein antibodies<br>and then out for a period of time<br>there's still there some of these people<br>have been re-vaccinated after covert<br>infection<br>for the nuclear capsid protein as<br>expected vaccination here gives you no<br>nuclear capsid antibodies and so you can<br>use this to figure out who's been<br>vaccinated and not had covert and vice<br>versa and it turns out that out to two<br>years afterwards this still measurable<br>antibody responses so your memory cells<br>and your immune system your B memory<br>cells that are floating around are still<br>tuning out this stuff even after two<br>years what that means we don't know but<br>and so on that particular study what I<br>really want to thank Scott loffler and<br>Aaron it's really hard to get a picture<br>of Aaron is has he done something does<br>he look but the covert Queens here<br>Lorraine Judy Sarah and Jackie always<br>ready to fight the good fight Steve<br>Chambers The Godfather of infectious<br>diseases here on campus he was being<br>extremely helpful Barry and Judy in<br>hematology doing T-cell work absolutely<br>fantastic and John or Donald Trump would<br>call immunologist and Paula Keating from<br>the cdhb as well<br>absolutely fantastic collaboration very<br>very much appreciate of it and hopefully<br>we can continue it in the future<br>so finally<br>um I just want to thank a few few people<br>who've been quite important along the<br>way<br>obviously my parents for conceiving of<br>the idea of conceiving me<br>um that's fantastic and for teaching me<br>things that are all important about life<br>and what to do and for introducing me to<br>the greatest Valley on the face of the<br>planet there will be no discussion<br>entered into here this is the waitaki<br>valley and this is facing west up to<br>araki just taken from a family batch and<br>we had many a good time this is actually<br>a photo of my parents on a motorbike<br>that had just been bought by the farmer<br>on Whose Land Air batches and he came<br>along and Dad tipped mum on the shoulder<br>and they stole it and they went into<br>Courier and didn't come back for an hour<br>because they went and had a cup of tea<br>so that was the kind of thing that we<br>got up to my brother Nick as well were<br>very supportive and these are my two<br>brothers Steve and Phil this is at<br>Phil's graduation in Cambridge and this<br>is one of the peculiar I'm so clever in<br>New Zealand this is one of the peculiar<br>peculiarities of English sort of upper<br>upper brick universities<br>both of them graduated from Cambridge<br>and Steve was a fellow and this is<br>Phil's graduation and this person here<br>had just come across to Stephen and told<br>and Phil's pointing this out and<br>Stephen's smiling because Steven said<br>I'm a fellow I can walk wherever I like<br>and she meant who<br>only in England right<br>all about the grass which is ironic<br>because I did caterpillars at the start<br>so you know anyway<br>um and then there's love and<br>or wouldn't with anyone else<br>but you did push me off the stairs there<br>so you can get the photo to your whole<br>self<br>um and then these guys um two of them<br>like to play dress up<br>um and this was at her it was a mission<br>to the bar yeah he'd already been to the<br>bar and you can tell by his drunken look<br>but anyway<br>um there in London now this guy's in<br>Wellington finishing up his well doing a<br>very good job of trying not to finish<br>his b combat he's he's getting there<br>um this one's in the audience there<br>um cutting here and making sick beats<br>yeah and then this guy he's a lot of<br>trouble and unfortunately the Apple<br>doesn't fall far from the tree but he's<br>a good kid<br>um and then also to colleagues Hora Mahi<br>um I couldn't find a better group to<br>work with absolutely fantastic<br>particularly these guys here know<br>um but Matt Liu Sarah Noel Liz Joe<br>Janice Tim Sarah I've done here Andrew<br>Mark<br>who's doing an mbchb and a PhD at the<br>same time<br>why anyway<br>Sarah Lindley and then Jackie<br>Joy Kirsten who's just come on board<br>karanya Kirsten Jay a PhD student and<br>Taylor Keys who's done a midsize honors<br>with us while he's lifting weights or<br>something there absolutely fantastic<br>team I'm very privileged to kind of be<br>standing here on the back of all the<br>um and I particularly want to thank<br>these kairahi or mentors in particular<br>uh Tim and Eric for believing me in the<br>start and giving me the introduction to<br>the PHD and I'd like to thank Eric in<br>particular<br>for when I was doing my PhD you also<br>wrote my PhD in pin on the other side of<br>the printed page and I could not believe<br>that I would give you 20 pages and I<br>would get 20 pages of writing back<br>absolutely amazing absolutely amazing<br>um also Prof nickels everybody's got a<br>Gary story and we've named our center<br>after him but your encouragement and<br>support along the way has been<br>absolutely fantastic<br>I'll put this photo up here because he's<br>getting another award how many awards<br>can a guy get but he's got his suitable<br>optimism there you know not content with<br>running the chi he disappears off to<br>another country and builds another<br>research group there I think a lot of us<br>here realize the contribution that Mark<br>has made and the support he's given<br>absolutely fantastic<br>so if you're watching this online Mark<br>your support and encouragement over the<br>years has been an awful lot<br>Mountain team the<br>um from the Ed Department he's a great<br>guy Martin Tanner I really want to thank<br>does he know he's not here I really want<br>to thank him for letting us loose and<br>being able to walk around the Ed with<br>him and actually watch what goes on the<br>amount of learning that happens is<br>fantastic<br>and then<br>I can't count the number of times that<br>studies and ethics proposals and just<br>general conversations and making things<br>happen and now I know you won the baking<br>Bake Off award there<br>but Lorraine you're an absolute treasure<br>and you've done pretty good for the<br>young girl from Bell Maine I think and<br>it's been a real honor and privilege to<br>have worked with you<br>so<br>finally<br>it was recently suggested via a send or<br>email issue here<br>she better be here that you are what you<br>wear<br>and that you can always change careers<br>if it doesn't work out maybe to<br>now you come to work in a blue top and<br>all hell breaks loose<br>and I thought this was highly unfair and<br>so I think it needs to be judged up a<br>little so we need Chris what's Miriam<br>done now<br>uh neck yellow had nothing to do with it<br>but she took the photo and the<br>instigator Miriam it wasn't me and I'll<br>just say that you know all of that's<br>been put together by Revenge as a dish<br>best served cold at ipl's meat so on<br>that Wiggly note I'd like to thank you<br>all for listening and the kai is almost<br>here thank you very much<br>foreign<br>and<br>cardiovascular disease and we've<br>certainly had that and our careers<br>introducing boundaries so in that<br>episode I was trying to think about<br>things that are coming out of this<br>um<br>and these are the things that I came up<br>with so I won't reiterate the content<br>because a lot of it but uh I think the<br>things that I identified with were kind<br>of the interesting of science student so<br>curiosity which is obviously driven to<br>science and there's lots of different<br>parts of Science and back then where you<br>see something and think what's going on<br>there and you follow it up it's very<br>fantastic<br>mentorship and teamwork is obviously a<br>really big part of How We Do Science and<br>it's being a big part of your doing<br>science and it's really fantastic to see<br>you at knowledge of all the people we've<br>and I think the the way that<br>you spend from the biochemistry and some<br>of this I haven't really understood and<br>uh I've crossed through to thinking<br>about<br>um diagnosis of prognosis and continuity<br>treatment is just a brilliant<br>illustration of translational science<br>and what we'll do really well in the<br>University<br>areas<br>um<br>the uh commercialization<br>um and some of our new company and<br>trying to interact with a whole another<br>world of finance and so on this was<br>really interesting for when I have never<br>tried to do here<br>at the producer making and the um the<br>potential for uh coming up with ways of<br>diagnosing people's prognosis so that we<br>can reduce the arrests which is<br>obviously important and I guess finally<br>in terms of the politics it's just worth<br>noting that kind of excellencies as one<br>of the biggest causes of death and loss<br>of quality life of New Zealand days and<br>many countries so this is a really<br>important area to be doing this and so<br>thank you very much for explaining all<br>therapist I think Melania long has been<br>curious I'm very grateful for you in<br>terms of character new career and I<br>really hope they are both being said<br>about the longest many many of you the<br>same first language<br>and research boldness of what I think<br>that really was a beautiful Timber<br>actually brought all the characters that<br>you've had in your career and um I know<br>it's far more proud of you but I hope<br>you also know that the euroc team is<br>really proud of you we're really<br>grateful to have you at the topic<br>and actually look forward to new<br>adventures and what else you would do<br>and now that we have to address it as<br>Professor Pinkerton<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
