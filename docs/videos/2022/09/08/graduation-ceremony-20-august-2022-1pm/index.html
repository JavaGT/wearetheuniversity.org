recent years universities in new<br>zealand and worldwide have placed<br>increasing emphasis on their research<br>performance and on the commercialization<br>of research<br>turning very clever research outcomes<br>into products and services that are good<br>for society<br>and commercially valuable<br>one such one such success arising from<br>university of otago research is pacific<br>edge limited a cancer diagnostics<br>company specialising in discovering<br>building and commercializing innovative<br>cancer diagnostic tests<br>this afternoon's guest speaker is david<br>darling former chief executive officer<br>of pacific edge who retired from this<br>role earlier this year<br>mr mr darling has over 40 years business<br>experience in the development and<br>international commercialisation of<br>biomedical and biotechnology businesses<br>and products<br>he led pacific edge from its early<br>inception<br>contributing significantly to its global<br>strategy and achievements<br>please join me in welcoming mr david<br>darling to deliver the graduation<br>address<br>good afternoon<br>it's an honor and a privilege to be here<br>to give the graduation address on your<br>special day<br>i'd like to acknowledge the academic and<br>leadership teams from the university of<br>otago<br>parents and other distinguished guests<br>here today and of course the graduates<br>for august 2022<br>my name is david darling and i've<br>recently retired as the ceo of pacific<br>edge a global business that develops and<br>commercializes molecular diagnostics for<br>the better detection and management of<br>cancer<br>a company that was developed and runs<br>its global business from right here in<br>dunedin<br>firstly congratulations on your<br>graduation this is a big milestone for<br>you all and represents a significant<br>amount of mahi<br>many lectures exams late nights liters<br>of beer and perpetual parties i'm sure<br>i spent some time thinking about what i<br>could say to you today that would be<br>relevant or what you may want to hear or<br>even some stories that i could tell and<br>perhaps some thoughts to share with you<br>i can remember my graduations just but i<br>can't remember who the speaker was<br>or what the speaker had to say<br>so it can't have been that compelling<br>and it probably didn't have any impact<br>i decided that today i would talk to you<br>about making a difference<br>and to share with you some of our<br>pacific edge story<br>it started with the death of a young<br>girl from a complication caused by<br>cancer<br>it's the story of a small band of people<br>who left the security of their known<br>jobs and academic labs to go to the dark<br>side and have a go<br>in the world of cancer we at pacific<br>edge all knew that the tools that<br>physicians used to detect and manage<br>cancer were poor<br>our vision<br>was of discovering and<br>commercializing our vision involves<br>discovering and commercializing<br>non-invasive molecular tests for early<br>detection and better management of<br>cancer to make a difference<br>but i want to start by talking to you<br>about what happened to me when i was six<br>years old<br>i drowned in a flooded sheep dip that<br>was full of insecticide and i was found<br>more than five minutes later 12 feet<br>down on the bottom about as technically<br>dead as you can get<br>i was pulled out and given this new<br>technique called mouth-to-mouth<br>resuscitation by my uncle who had just<br>graduated the course a few months<br>earlier<br>the impact of my misadventures didn't<br>end there<br>in my twenties i was shot in the head<br>i felt the impact and the shock<br>realization a bit like getting hit in<br>the head with a hockey stick<br>luckily it hit the bone and lodged<br>itself behind my eye<br>eight hours later at 9 pm on a sunday<br>night a physician was called back to the<br>hospital to do the surgery and patch me<br>up<br>i got to be thinking about this and<br>realized a couple of things<br>secondly that you can always use a<br>little bit of luck<br>and thirdly that it's all about the<br>people<br>each of the people that patch me up had<br>all graduated and that their actions on<br>those days mattered<br>they made a difference to me and because<br>of that i was alive and was able to be<br>part of a small group of technicians and<br>scientists most of whom who had<br>graduated from the university of otago<br>that dared to dream to make a difference<br>i'm talking about pacific edge our<br>global cancer diagnostics company<br>our blue skies hypothesis at the start<br>was that tumor cells would express genes<br>differentially to those of normal cells<br>no one at this time knew this to be true<br>at about the same time the human genome<br>had just been sequenced and a company<br>had just started up in germany making<br>short sections of the coding for each of<br>the 32 000 human genes<br>so diving into the deep end with nothing<br>more than a few pacific pesos in the<br>bank account and a huge vision<br>we bought a bunch of these short<br>synthetic genes from germany build<br>ourselves a robot and started pin<br>printing 32 000 genes onto glass slides<br>for each patient<br>and then set about testing tumor tissue<br>and matching normal tissue from hundreds<br>of patients in five cancers<br>gastric colorectal endometrial melanoma<br>and bladder cancer<br>this time of discovery lasted three and<br>a half years at the end of which we dove<br>into our gene expression database for<br>the first of many aha moments<br>we found that our hypothesis to be true<br>and we were able to identify gene<br>signatures for our five cancers today<br>our patent attorneys tell us<br>that we have one of the largest patent<br>portfolios in new zealand<br>of the five cancers that we were working<br>on we chose bladder cancer to be the<br>first one to commercialize<br>we asked the urologists if we could do<br>one thing for you that would make a<br>they told us and we made that molecular<br>test it's called cx bladder detect<br>we went on to find out that urologists<br>had many clinical issues that we could<br>help with<br>over the years<br>the science and technology development<br>was unrelenting there wasn't an easy way<br>there was no root map and in commercial<br>science this simply wasn't an option to<br>quit<br>we had to find a way through<br>or around the many roadblocks<br>today we have four proprietary molecular<br>tests in the market that cover clinical<br>decision making across the entire<br>bladder cancer pathway<br>this new technology and approach to<br>urology is comprehensive<br>and revolutionary<br>pacific edge and the small team of<br>people in dunedin and in the us became<br>the leading company in the world to take<br>this approach and successfully deliver<br>commercial outcomes for patients and<br>physicians alike<br>cx bladder products are accurate and<br>they are disruptive to medical practice<br>and yet despite this disruption<br>new zealand neurologists have embraced<br>the explainer they've added these tests<br>to the standard of care and in many<br>cases cx bladder has replaced the<br>previous gold standard cystoscopy<br>today new zealand neurologists lead the<br>world many of them no longer practice<br>urology the same way they were trained<br>they are making a significant difference<br>pacific edge has commercial operations<br>in new zealand australia singapore and<br>the united states we employ 86 people<br>30 of whom are in dunedin our global<br>head office and the place where we do<br>the new product development and product<br>improvement we have a dedicated team of<br>54 people in the us driving our<br>commercial sales<br>however the<br>global logistics the digital marketing<br>and the coding of de novo software and<br>technology that runs our tests are all<br>operated from dunedin<br>i have often paused to look back at the<br>distance that each and every one of our<br>team has traveled in making all this<br>happen<br>often from a start point as an academic<br>scientist a technician or a software<br>coder<br>every day they make a difference in the<br>company that impacts positively on<br>people's lives<br>in 2020 pacific edge's commercial growth<br>rate propelled us into the nzx's s p 50<br>index<br>ranked 38 with a market capitalization<br>of close to a billion dollars<br>to date we have invested close to 200<br>million dollars of shareholders funds<br>and in 2021 we raised a further 100<br>million dollars to further the growth of<br>the company<br>today we continue to deliver and look<br>back and consider ourselves a 20-year<br>overnight success<br>throughout our journey this small group<br>of people stood up to be counted<br>they had many barriers to overcome from<br>the technological to the commercial to<br>regulatory and to reimbursement<br>from the doubters who repeatedly poured<br>cold water on us<br>to the press that seemed hell-bent on<br>discrediting us to the urologists who<br>wanted to protect their businesses and<br>the many investors who were looking for<br>commercial success<br>on a daily basis there was turmoil and<br>often chaos<br>we were working often in a state of<br>ambiguity and there was always pressure<br>to perform<br>and yet<br>despite this we persevered<br>we overcame all of this and built a<br>billion dollar company<br>so in your journey there will be risk<br>you're likely to fail with some of your<br>endeavors<br>it may well be painful<br>it may test you to your core<br>you need to embrace it<br>get over it stand up again focus and<br>move on<br>most of the time the only things that<br>you may be able to control will be your<br>attitude and your perseverance<br>always look for the positive because<br>when you're positive the negatives<br>dissipate and the doubters don't matter<br>throughout our 20-year journey to build<br>and grow pacific edge the things that<br>stand out to me<br>have all been to do with our people<br>it's always about our people<br>their will to succeed their unflappable<br>belief that we will prevail and their<br>ability to find humor and even the<br>toughest times<br>hitangata hitangata hitangata it is the<br>people the people the people<br>and our esprit de corps of pacific edge<br>is never ever ever give up<br>my challenge to you as you go forward in<br>your life and your career is to stand up<br>and be counted<br>to believe in yourself<br>accept that there will be risk and then<br>go out there and make a difference<br>it doesn't always need to be a big<br>difference<br>it may be just to pull a small boy out<br>of a flooded sheepdom<br>do this and you too may be blessed with<br>a life less ordinary<br>thank you and congratulations to you all<br>for your thoughtful and engaging address<br>this afternoon<br>we trust that your encouragement to<br>persevere through challenges will<br>resonate with our graduates as
