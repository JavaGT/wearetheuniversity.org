we're<br>very grateful for that I'll introduce<br>in recent years universities in New<br>Zealand and worldwide have placed<br>increasing emphasis on their research<br>performance and on the commercialization<br>of research turning very clever research<br>outcomes into products or services that<br>are good for society and commercially<br>valuable at the same time<br>one such success arriving arising from<br>the University of otago is Pacific Edge<br>Limited a cancer Diagnostics company<br>specializing in discovering building and<br>commercializing Innovative cancer<br>diagnostic tests<br>this afternoon's guest speaker is David<br>darling former Chief Executive Officer<br>of Pacific Edge who retired from this<br>Mr darling has over 40 years experience<br>in the development and international<br>commercialization of biomedical and<br>biotechnology businesses and products<br>and he led Pacific Edge from its early<br>Inception contributing significantly to<br>its Global strategy and its significant<br>achievements<br>please join me in welcoming Mr David<br>darling to deliver the graduation<br>address<br>good afternoon it's an honor and a<br>privilege to be here to give the<br>graduation address on your special day<br>I would like to acknowledge the academic<br>and Leadership teams from the University<br>of otago parents and other distinguished<br>guests here today and of course the<br>graduates for August 2022.<br>my name is David darling and I have<br>recently retired as the CEO of Pacific<br>Edge a global business that develops and<br>commercializes molecular diagnostics for<br>the better detection and management of<br>cancer<br>a company that was developed and runs<br>its Global business from right here in<br>Dunedin<br>firstly congratulations on your<br>graduation this is the big milestone for<br>you all and represents a significant<br>amount of Mahi many lectures exams late<br>nights liters of beer and Perpetual<br>parties I'm sure<br>I spent some time thinking about what I<br>could say to you today that would be<br>relevant or what you may want to hear or<br>even what stories I could tell and<br>perhaps some thoughts to share with you<br>I can remember my graduations just but I<br>can't remember who the speaker was or<br>what the speaker had to say<br>like so it kind of been that compelling<br>and it probably didn't have any impact<br>on my immediate future<br>I decided that today I would talk to you<br>about making a difference<br>and to share with you some of our<br>Pacific age story<br>it started with the death of a young<br>girl from a complication caused by<br>cancer it's a story of a small band of<br>people who left the security of their<br>known jobs and academic labs to go to<br>the dark side and have a go<br>in the world of cancer we at Pacific Air<br>Jordan you that the tools that<br>Physicians use to detect and manage<br>cancer were poor<br>our vision involved discovering and<br>commercializing non-invasive molecular<br>tests for early detection and better<br>management of cancer to make a<br>difference<br>I want to start by talking to you about<br>what happened to me when I was six years<br>old I drowned in a flooded sheep dip<br>that was full of insecticide and I was<br>found more than five minutes later 12<br>feet down on the bottom about as<br>technically dead as you can get I was<br>pulled out and given this new technique<br>called mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by<br>my uncle who had just graduated the<br>course a few months earlier<br>the impact of my Misadventures didn't<br>end there<br>in my 20s I was shot on the head<br>I felt the impact and the shock<br>realization a bit like getting hit in<br>the head with a hockey stick<br>luckily it hit the bone and lodged<br>itself behind my eye eight hours later<br>at 9pm on a Sunday night physician was<br>called back to the hospital to do the<br>surgery and Patch me up<br>I got to be thinking about this and<br>realized a couple of things<br>firstly that I'm clearly hard to kill<br>secondly that you can always use a<br>little bit of luck<br>and thirdly that it's all about the<br>people<br>each of the people that patched me up<br>had all graduated and that their actions<br>on those days mattered<br>they made a difference to me and because<br>of that I was alive and I was able to be<br>part of a small group of technologists<br>and scientists most of whom who had<br>graduated from the University of otago<br>that dared to dream to make a difference<br>I'm talking about Pacific Edge our<br>Global cancer Diagnostics company<br>our blue skies hypothesis at the start<br>was that tumor cells would Express genes<br>differentially to those of normal cells<br>no one at this time knew this to be true<br>at about the same time the human genome<br>had just been sequenced and a company<br>had just started up in Germany making<br>short sections of coding for each of the<br>32 000 human genes<br>diving into the deep end with nothing<br>more than a few Pacific pesos in the<br>bank account and a huge Vision we bought<br>a bunch of these short synthetic genes<br>from Germany built ourselves a robot and<br>started pin printing 32 000 genes onto a<br>glass slide for each patient<br>and then said about testing tumor tissue<br>and matching normal tissue from hundreds<br>of patients and five cancers gastric<br>colorectal endometrial melanoma and<br>bladder cancer<br>this time of Discovery lasted three and<br>a half years at the end of which we dove<br>into our gene expression database for<br>the first of many aha moments<br>we found our hypothesis to be true and<br>we were able to identify Gene signatures<br>for our five cancers<br>today our patent attorneys tell us that<br>we have one of the largest patent<br>portfolios in New Zealand<br>of the five cancers that we were working<br>on we chose bladder cancer to be the<br>first one to commercialize<br>we asked the urologists if we could do<br>one thing for you that would make a<br>difference what would that be<br>they told us and we made that test it's<br>called sea exploded detect<br>we went on to find out that urologists<br>had many clinical issues that we could<br>help with<br>over these years the Science and<br>Technology development was unrelenting<br>there wasn't an easy way there was no<br>root map and in commercial science there<br>simply wasn't an option to quit<br>we had to find a way through or around<br>the mini roadblocks<br>today we have four proprietary molecular<br>tests in the market that cover clinical<br>decision making across the entire<br>bladder cancer pathway<br>this new technology and approach to<br>Urology is comprehensive and<br>revolutionary<br>Pacific Edge and the small team of<br>people in Dunedin and the U.S became the<br>leading company in the world to take<br>this approach and successfully deliver<br>commercial outcomes for patients and<br>Physicians alike<br>now she explained products are accurate<br>and they are disruptive to Medical<br>practice and yet despite this disruption<br>New Zealand urologists have embraced CX<br>bladder they have added these tools to<br>their standard of care and in many<br>instances CX splatter has replaced the<br>previous gold standard cystoscopy<br>today New Zealand urologists lead the<br>world many of them no longer practice<br>Urology the way they were trained they<br>are making a significant difference<br>today Pacific Edge has commercial<br>operations in New Zealand Australia<br>Singapore and the USA we employ 86<br>people 30 of whom are in Dunedin our<br>Global head office and the place where<br>we do the new product development and<br>product Improvement<br>we have a dedicated team of 54 people in<br>the U.S driving our commercial sales<br>however the gold the global logistics<br>the digital marketing the coding of the<br>de novo software and technology that<br>runs our tests are all operated from<br>Dunedin<br>I've often paused to look back at the<br>distance that each and every one of our<br>team have traveled and making this all<br>happen<br>often from a start Point as an academic<br>scientist a technician or a software<br>coder<br>every day they make a difference in the<br>company that impacts positively on<br>people's lives<br>in 2020 Pacific ages commercial growth<br>rate propelled us into the nzx S p50<br>index rank 38 with the market<br>capitalization of close to 1 billion<br>dollars<br>to date we have invested close to 200<br>million dollars of shareholders funds<br>and in 2021 we raised a further 100<br>million dollars to further the growth of<br>the company<br>today we continue to deliver and look<br>back and consider ourselves a 20-year<br>overnight success<br>throughout our journey this small group<br>of people stood up to be counted they<br>had many barriers to overcome from the<br>technological to the commercial to<br>Regulatory and to the reimbursement from<br>the from the doubters who repeatedly<br>poured cold water on us<br>to the press that seemed hell-bent on<br>discrediting us to the urologists who<br>wanted to protect their businesses and<br>the many investors who were looking for<br>commercial success<br>on a daily basis there was turmoil and<br>often chaos<br>we were working often in a state of<br>ambiguity and there was always pressure<br>to perform and yet despite this we<br>persevered<br>we overcame all of this and build a<br>billion dollar company<br>so in your journey there will be risk<br>you are likely to fail with some of your<br>endeavors it may well be painful it may<br>test you to your core<br>you need to embrace it get over it<br>stand up again focus and move on<br>most of the time the only things that<br>you may be able to control will be your<br>attitude and your perseverance<br>always look for the positive because<br>when you're positive the negatives<br>dissipate and the doubters don't matter<br>throughout our 20-year Journey To Build<br>and Grow Pacific Edge the things that<br>stand out to me have been all been to do<br>with our people<br>it's always about our people<br>they're well to succeed their<br>unflappable belief that we will prevail<br>and their ability to find humor and even<br>the toughest times<br>it<br>is the people the people the people<br>now it's free to court a Pacific Edge is<br>never ever ever give up<br>my challenge to you as you go forward in<br>your life and your career is to stand up<br>and be counted to believe in yourself<br>except that there will be risk and then<br>go out there and make a difference<br>it doesn't always need to be a big<br>difference it may just be to pull a<br>small boy out of a flooded sheep that<br>do this and you may too will be blessed<br>with a life less ordinary<br>thank you and congratulations to you all<br>on your graduation<br>David thank you very much for your<br>thoughtful and engaging address this<br>afternoon<br>we trust that your encouragement to<br>persevere through challenges will<br>resonate with our graduates as they<br>embark on the next
