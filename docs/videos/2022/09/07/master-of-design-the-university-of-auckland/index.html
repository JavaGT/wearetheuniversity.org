font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm Nazia, and I'm studying a Master of Design.<br>So, before I started this programme, I <br>thought that people had to be either creative  <br>or practical, and I considered <br>myself to be practical.<br>But the Master of Design programme taught me <br>that everyone is capable of both of those skills,  <br>and it really allowed me to embrace <br>my creativity and my practicality.<br>So, I actually fell into the <br>world of design by accident.<br>So, I studied public health, and I was <br>working in strategy at the hospital,  <br>and I was exposed to design thinking <br>as a way to help patient outcomes,<br>and I realised that this is a really awesome  <br>strategy to problem solve, and <br>I wanted to do it full-time.<br>I chose the University of Auckland <br>Master of Design programme  <br>because I really wanted to gain an <br>understanding of design theories and concepts.<br>But, I was very conscious of the fact that <br>I don't come from a design background,  <br>and this programme is quite unique in that <br>you don't have to have a design background.<br>So, my classmates, they've <br>come from a range of fields.<br>The Master of Design welcomes people from any <br>professional or academic discipline, and because  <br>it can be studied part-time or full-time, either <br>as a taught masters or research masters, it aims  <br>to fit into your life, and it helps you build on <br>or change your career path and academic pursuit.<br>I think there's often a misunderstanding <br>of what design actually means.<br>A lot of people think it's purely visual, and <br>they think of graphic design or fashion design,  <br>but design's a lot more than that.<br>It involves creating positive change in society, <br>and it involves a different way of thinking.<br>The Master of Design is important because you'll <br>learn how to be ready for the future of work  <br>and use design-led thinking <br>to make a positive impact.<br>So, people who are creative problem solvers, <br>critical thinkers, and they're confident  <br>in the use of technology, they'll be able <br>to remain resilient as the world changes.<br>So, you'll become strong in these <br>skills by studying a Master of Design  <br>which enhances your employability, and it <br>enables you to provide design leadership  <br>across a variety of sectors like health, <br>business, transportation, and so much more.<br>There's a range of papers that you <br>can study around things like design  <br>methodology, design technology, design practice.<br>There's also an internship paper.<br>For that paper, we worked in <br>teams with a real-life client.<br>In this case, Johnson &amp; Johnson.<br>So, we really had to apply design <br>thinking to identify a problem  <br>in their business and figure <br>out a way of solving it,<br>and that was fantastic being able to deal <br>with a real-life client and see what kinds  <br>of design problems come up in everyday life.<br>So, I'm fascinated by the field of design <br>research, and in my future career, I really  <br>want to problem solve and work with people <br>to understand what's going on in their lives.<br>But, there's a range of fields that people <br>who study the Master of Design can go into.<br>So, things like design strategy, <br>things like service design,  <br>or things like user experience design.<br>My personal favourite was the masters computer <br>lab which honestly became my home away from home.<br>So, they have really powerful <br>computers and speakers and things that  <br>help you produce work that you're proud of.<br>There's also the FabLab, and there's <br>technicians at the FabLab who are honestly  <br>so helpful, and they're really <br>happy for you to pester them  <br>to figure out, you know, what technology <br>you need to support your learning journey.<br>Beyond just the studying aspect, there's so <br>many warm and inviting spaces on campus where  <br>I was able to just hang <br>out with friends and relax.<br>The Design school is incredibly supportive, and <br>the staff and students, they all have your back.<br>And so, I've learned a lot <br>from the lecturers who are  <br>experts in their fields, but I've also <br>learned a lot from my classmates because  <br>they come from a range of different backgrounds, <br>and they all bring quite unique strengths.<br>If I had to summarise the Design school <br>in one word, I'd say "collaborative."<br>At Design, we're guided by our <br>whakataukī (Māori proverb), which  <br>means "together we're weaving <br>the realisation of potential."<br>So, I hope you'll join us to study <br>Design at the University of Auckland.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
