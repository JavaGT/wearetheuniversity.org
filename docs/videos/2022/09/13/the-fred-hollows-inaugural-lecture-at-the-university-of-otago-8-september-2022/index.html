i'm have the<br>pleasure of being the deputy vice<br>chancellor academic here<br>and i'd like to<br>warmly welcome you all to this very<br>special lecture it's a real pleasure for<br>you all to be here and<br>particularly as this is the inaugural<br>fred hollows inaugural lecture<br>so it's a special opportunity for us at<br>the university to recognize one of our<br>alumni<br>and to particularly recognize fred<br>hollow's pioneering work<br>and also<br>to recognize the marquee that the fred<br>hollows foundation does<br>the way it undertakes eye health care<br>and also trains the teams that will<br>continue that work in the future<br>i too am delighted to welcome dr gabby<br>hollows as patron of the fred hollows<br>foundation and also craig fisher and sir<br>martin and wright<br>and i look forward to john to you<br>speaking later this evening<br>i'd also like to acknowledge all of you<br>who are friends and um<br>supporters of the fred's hollows<br>foundation<br>so this is obviously<br>our inaugural lecture to to commemorate<br>fred hollows<br>but it's also a time for us to deepen<br>our relationship with the fred hollows<br>university so fed hollows foundation so<br>later this evening we will be signing an<br>mou that marks that relationship between<br>the university and the foundation<br>and that mou recognises our desire for<br>the two organizations to work more<br>closely together particularly in the<br>pacific<br>so the university otago is situated in<br>the pacific<br>and we're committed to helping our<br>pacific students to thrive and also<br>supporting pacific communities in<br>aotearoa and new zealand and the wider<br>region<br>and our relationship with the fred<br>hollows<br>foundation reflects that commitment to<br>our pacific neighbours<br>and as part of that relationship we'll<br>be exploring the possibilities of some<br>internships for some of our pacific<br>health science students<br>in the foundation centers in fiji and<br>other parts of the pacific<br>you're probably aware that we already<br>have close relationships with some parts<br>of the pacific<br>particularly with fiji national<br>university and the cook islands and the<br>national university of samar<br>and i've been fortunate to be<br>a member of the council for the national<br>university of samar for the last six<br>years<br>and for me this has been a very special<br>experience both personally and<br>academically<br>it's really brought home to me the<br>importance of<br>true collaboration<br>and the realization that as new<br>zealanders we may be able to provide<br>expertise in some areas<br>but we have much to learn from our<br>neighbors and and colleagues in the<br>pacific<br>so before i hand over i also would like<br>to hope that this is just the beginning<br>of the fred hollows lectures<br>and that this can become a an annual<br>event where we can continue to celebrate<br>the inspirational work of fred hollows<br>okay<br>i'm just going to um play a short video<br>um and really highlights the work of<br>fred hollows um i'm a bit of a fred<br>hollows geek fan so i've watched a lot<br>of videos over the years so it's amazing<br>documentaries if you really want to<br>watch much more some beautiful 60<br>minutes so this is just a summary of all<br>his work and just really appreciate how<br>much of a heart he had<br>for helping the most poorest people in<br>this world<br>do<br>do<br>that every eye is an eye<br>when you're doing the surgery there that<br>is just as important as if you were<br>doing eye surgery<br>on the prime minister or the king<br>just like to welcome to this<br>stage<br>the board chair of the fred hollows<br>foundation new zealand<br>craig fisher who was speaking on behalf<br>of audrema ceo of the fred hollows<br>and warm pacific greetings to you all<br>tonight<br>the fred hollows<br>broader whanau<br>and university of otago<br>um<br>i just get to say a few words tonight<br>here to mark the milestone that is the<br>30th anniversary of the fred hollows<br>foundation<br>being established<br>and the work of<br>fred<br>is a son of<br>tipoti dunedin<br>fred is a son of<br>university of otago<br>fred is a kiwi icon<br>he's an australian icon too<br>and i don't know if everyone knows here<br>but fred is the only new zealander to<br>have been made australian of the year<br>which is a pretty special thing<br>so in the spirit of trans tasman sharing<br>we have shared our kiwi son fred with<br>the australians and more importantly<br>with the world<br>and with<br>countries that need help<br>because they don't have<br>as good a health and education systems<br>as we have here in new zealand and in<br>australia<br>and that's driven fred and it's driven<br>all of us who have been involved in the<br>fred hollows foundation since then<br>to carry on his legacy<br>it's really important that i make a few<br>acknowledgements<br>firstly the acknowledgement to gabby<br>hollows gabby is our patron<br>and a patron of the australian<br>foundation as well<br>and more than a patron she<br>worked alongside fred for years<br>and since fred's sad passing has<br>continued to work alongside everyone in<br>the foundation<br>motivating<br>going beyond the call of duty<br>to make sure that there's support<br>wherever possible so thank you gabby for<br>all that you have done<br>it really is appreciated<br>i'd also like to<br>acknowledge the another<br>son of dunedin<br>associate professor gordon sanderson the<br>late gordon sanderson who was briefly a<br>trustee of the fred hollows foundation<br>new zealand and a beloved trustee we we<br>all miss him desperately<br>he made such an impact in the time that<br>he was with us<br>and<br>we felt a real loss of the connection of<br>otago with with the passing off gordon<br>also to note that<br>martin enright one of the other current<br>trustees here at the moment and the<br>reason for noting martin is twofold<br>firstly he's not a sir sorry<br>um we do have a sir on the board but<br>it's not him it's another martin<br>just to confuse things<br>but martin is a third generation<br>graduate of the university of otago<br>so i think that's pretty impressive his<br>parents and grandparents<br>so um yeah nice to nice to have that<br>what i really want to do those quickly<br>is to acknowledge that for all the good<br>work that's been done there's lots more<br>to do in the pacific<br>and<br>there's good work being done but there's<br>always more and we need help<br>we need partnerships we need people to<br>care<br>and thank you to all of you here that<br>have cared in your special ways but like<br>helen has said i really hope that this<br>can be the start of an inaugural<br>annual lecture<br>to ensure that we keep the icon of fred<br>hollows and what he did and what he<br>stood for alive<br>globally nine out of ten people that are<br>blind<br>and that's a pretty horrifying statistic<br>it can be relatively easily fixed<br>blindness also is unfair<br>we did a rapid assessment of<br>avoidable blindness in papua new guinea<br>a little while ago and that showed us<br>that 61 of those that were blind or<br>female<br>so that's quite an imbalance in terms of<br>gender<br>and that<br>sort of statistic happens in some other<br>countries as well so definitely<br>something we need to address<br>we're really looking forward to engaging<br>with the university of otago the<br>community the facility the students the<br>alumni<br>and inviting really everyone to be a<br>part of this sightsaving journey because<br>it is something that's practical and<br>possible<br>and it's been proven that we can make a<br>real difference<br>wherever we can we'd like to<br>encourage<br>especially pacific medical students<br>to actively get involved in this there's<br>opportunities for outreach<br>to help uh hone the skills to learn more<br>and<br>maybe get inspired to actually work in<br>in<br>some specific countries as well<br>so that would be a wonderful thing<br>but i'd just like to finish off with<br>thanking all of the donors because i met<br>a couple of donors out here before and<br>people who quietly told me that they'd<br>been donating for 20 years plus<br>that enables our team to train more<br>doctors and nurses from the pacific for<br>the pacific in the pacific<br>to do the work that we do so to each and<br>every one of you who has helped in<br>whatever way<br>thank you very much on behalf of the<br>foundation<br>thank you very much craig<br>um<br>i'm really excited<br>really excited thank you so much thank<br>you so much for what you've just shared<br>but thank you so much for coming on<br>board<br>um because we're fighting a fight and<br>and you've mentioned what that fight is<br>and to have your involvement to help<br>get more of our future doctors trained<br>to do what you do um to do what the<br>foundation does is really exciting um<br>just<br>getting together with um joe and the<br>team<br>and just whenever they talk about<br>red and the foundation there's always so<br>much passion and so much excitement and<br>we all want to work in an environment<br>where everyone loves what they do<br>and we really feel it in the people that<br>we've got to engage with um just<br>recently so thank you so much<br>and definitely<br>it's exciting for our pacific training<br>doctors our pacific students who are<br>here at the university of otago<br>to have this funding into the university<br>of otago to help get more of our trained<br>our<br>get more health professionals out<br>with this vision and to improve vision<br>so so thank you very much<br>so we'd like to thank you craig<br>thank you for what you've shared<br>and we have a small gift um to give to<br>you<br>um<br>oh yeah yeah thanks xavier<br>could you please put our hands together<br>and please forgive me and we also have<br>a gift for kaumatua<br>i got a bit excited with the bright<br>lights so forgive me and thank you very<br>very much reverend alofa thank you so<br>much for your aloha and always um coming<br>and and supporting um all our<br>engagements so we have a small gift for<br>it's all the way from the solomon<br>islands<br>and we got told that danine was a little<br>chilly today but he was looking forward<br>to the snow<br>so<br>we can give dr john cetu a very big warm<br>welcome he's the medical director of the<br>fred hollows foundation new zealand<br>he's been delivering eye care uh into<br>the pacific region for over 30 years and<br>when we think about an inaugural speaker<br>i don't think there's anybody more<br>deserving and we're very honored that<br>you've come all the way from the<br>beautiful solomon islands to odopoki at<br>the netherlands so<br>thank you<br>warm pacific greetings<br>to you all here today<br>thank you for the lovely introduction<br>xavier<br>dr xavier<br>thank you so much to otago university<br>for hosting this<br>wonderful event tonight<br>in particular<br>va or tatau<br>i'm very happy to be<br>here tonight to deliver this first<br>of hopefully many lectures<br>in the future<br>when i started delivering eye care in<br>there were hardly any ophthalmologists<br>or eye nurses in the pacific islands<br>region<br>eye care was virtually<br>delivered<br>there were very high levels of blindness<br>in the region blindness and including<br>visual impairment<br>and a large backlog of treatable<br>blindness especially<br>cataracts<br>fast forward today<br>fred hollows foundation new zealand has<br>trained<br>327 eye doctors and nurses<br>from 13 different countries<br>in the pacific region plus t molester<br>and interestingly 80 percent<br>of which are still active in ikea across<br>the region<br>this map shows the location of the<br>graduates that the fred hollis has<br>trained<br>and continues to support also through<br>its comprehensive workforce support<br>program<br>where senior clinicians<br>continue to mentor and provide<br>continuous professional development<br>support<br>many of whom are only eye care<br>specialists in their clinics or<br>so<br>who has brought us all here today and<br>enabled this impact<br>a visionary<br>fred hollows<br>and his wife<br>gabby hollows<br>who we are so privileged<br>gabby<br>you are the reason that fred's legacy is<br>so strong<br>30 years on<br>and the impact that your foundation has<br>had is<br>immeasurable<br>professor fred hollis put<br>simply is a real<br>legend<br>although i never had the privilege of<br>i wish that i did<br>it would have been amazing to learn<br>some of the early techniques in surgery<br>in eye care from fred himself<br>watch him operate<br>as well to have as well as to have<br>conversations<br>ikea in developing countries<br>the work of threat holders making eye<br>care accessible<br>to the poorer parts of the world<br>through the manufacturing of<br>affordable high quality intraocular<br>lenses<br>has greatly<br>inspired me throughout my career<br>for those who do not know intraocular<br>lenses are artificial lenses that<br>replace<br>the cartridge lens<br>during surgery<br>this is what the surgeons put in after<br>now back when i first started working in<br>eye care cataracts were removed and eyes<br>were stitched up again with very thin<br>nylon<br>threads sutures<br>and the patients were giving thick<br>glasses<br>very thick glasses like the bottom of<br>all<br>cooked bottles<br>though the quality of the<br>the restored vision was not the same as<br>with<br>but still the vision is really great<br>it is still dramatic the visual recovery<br>patients can see well again after living<br>in darkness<br>for many many years<br>they were very happy even wearing the<br>very thick cutter glasses we call them<br>plus stems that's the actual power of<br>i recall the visiting teams bringing in<br>intraocular lenses<br>around the late 80s that's when i was a<br>young chap<br>i learned the techniques of inserting<br>intraocular lenses at<br>in adelaide and flinders medical center<br>in australia in the late 80s<br>where i was training for a year i recall<br>back in the solomons i used to save<br>these<br>intra ocular lenses<br>when the team which the teams brought<br>after they leave i saved them for the<br>special<br>younger patients<br>now we insert these lenses<br>into<br>every single eye that needs<br>cataract surgery cataract removed and<br>foundation who started<br>producing these lenses in<br>for the developing world<br>in the the intraocular lens laboratories<br>in nepal and eritrea<br>he brought the prices down from during<br>those days it was um 500 600<br>us dollars<br>it brought the prices right down to five<br>dollars now in and in some places 4.50<br>making them really affordable<br>so clearly you can see that<br>fred was not only an ophthalmologist<br>and a humanitarian but he was also a<br>savvy businessman he knows<br>many in the family community in<br>australia during those days australia<br>and new zealand they were skeptical<br>about the manufacturing and introduction<br>of these lenses in the developing<br>countries they thought that it would<br>never work<br>but fred had a vision<br>and was<br>determined<br>to make these lenses accessible and<br>affordable<br>to the rest of the world who could not<br>in 1994 the fred hollows<br>intraocular lenses<br>laboratory<br>was opened in till ganga<br>in nepal where the himalayas are<br>and<br>in the same year<br>also in eritrea another laboratory was<br>opened<br>manufacturing these special lenses<br>and both of these laboratories these<br>factories are still in operation today<br>along with many others now doing the<br>same thing<br>and this enables<br>for us<br>to provide<br>good cataract surgery to millions<br>of people<br>sadly<br>fred<br>never got to see this reality and he<br>on<br>so just before that<br>before the landslides opened<br>but the foundation was<br>established still<br>to keep fred's dream alive<br>and i'm sure he would be astounded<br>if he were here today to see the impact<br>of his legacy<br>across the world<br>as gabby says<br>he would be doing<br>i have been asked today to talk about my<br>journey in ikea including my 21 years<br>at the fred hollis foundation<br>i don't really like talking about myself<br>very much<br>but i will do my best to<br>share some of my story with you in the<br>hope that perhaps<br>some<br>inspire<br>perhaps inspiring some<br>young throbbing doctors and health<br>professionals<br>i was a young doctor fresh out of med<br>school<br>in 1984<br>and just completed my medical<br>registration as a regional medical<br>officer in papua new guinea<br>i returned home to the solomon islands<br>in 1986<br>and started as a general doctor<br>covering the outpatients<br>and emergency and surgery<br>looking after the pigs world as well<br>so i had to be<br>to be able to survive during those days<br>there was an extreme shortage of<br>doctors<br>only a handful of local doctors<br>but many expats during those days<br>so a year later i was assigned to the<br>general surgery department<br>fixing bones<br>and sometimes doing caesarean sections<br>of course there were many photos of the<br>early days<br>there were no smartphones then<br>and the photos that i did have were<br>taken<br>by a tsunami as a result of climate<br>change<br>so it's fault of climate change we have<br>to do something about climate change<br>in the early days i'd admired i really<br>admired much the missing teams from<br>australia and new zealand<br>and also from japan and other countries<br>europe uk u.s visiting uh the solomons<br>and the region<br>but mostly from the australian and new<br>zealand teams<br>i was assigned to assist<br>these teams working with them and even<br>accompanying them<br>peeping over their shoulders<br>observing and learning as much as i<br>could<br>that's how i developed interest in<br>ophthalmologies<br>i was inspired by the dramatic<br>transformation of blind patients<br>who could suddenly see<br>just after 15 minutes 10 minutes 15<br>minutes operation<br>you could transform somebody's life very<br>quickly<br>i had a few mentors like dr colstead<br>the late dick galbraith from the aspect<br>team dr richard le measure to mention a<br>few<br>they taught me basic ophthalmology and<br>eye surgery such as cartoon surgery<br>i got told that i had potential<br>i thought that was big<br>that got me excited and my interest<br>exploded<br>after i did a few procedures i reassured<br>myself hey<br>this isn't too hard this isn't<br>impossible<br>i can do it<br>if the tv worker can do it i can too<br>in my language<br>vaca means boat<br>and tiavaka means the boat people<br>well that's how the first white people<br>came to our shows by big boats<br>back when i first started working in eye<br>care cataracts were removed and the eyes<br>and very with very thin thin nylon<br>sutures and patients were given three<br>i started providing some information<br>informal training over my five years in<br>one hour to half a dozen<br>and one eye doctor<br>and half a dozen nurses were trained and<br>two well-equipped eye clinics<br>were established<br>these photos are of the one auto<br>national eye center which the foundation<br>significantly upgraded in 2019<br>dr castle van otter's only<br>ophthalmologist is pictured<br>so i began my love affair with<br>ophthalmology after<br>the first one to two years i got called<br>the eye doctor<br>with a<br>without a qualification<br>but i was the only doctor in solomon<br>islands who could fix eyes<br>who know how to treat basic eye<br>conditions<br>and do minor surgeries<br>our minister of health thought that the<br>skills i had acquired over the years was<br>enough to attend to basic eye care needs<br>and services for the hospital<br>i continued working as a sole eye care<br>provider<br>i care practitioner working with<br>visiting teams<br>self-learning<br>and reading whatever textbooks i could<br>get a hold of and upskilling myself<br>when visiting teams come<br>but i was not happy with this i needed<br>qualifications<br>to be recognized<br>this went on for more than six years<br>i used to ask myself was<br>i decided to leave<br>once again to undertake the postgraduate<br>diploma in ophthalmology i had no<br>support from my government<br>i sponsored myself<br>while supporting my family who came with<br>me<br>by working as at about as part-time at a<br>local private practice while studying at<br>the same time<br>after that i pursued my master's<br>highly reputed training center<br>and service provision center<br>which we have embedded within the fiji<br>health system<br>although friend holders continue to<br>support the institute<br>it is now owned by the refugee minister<br>of health cwm hospital<br>and provides the facilities for the<br>hospital's eye clinic as well<br>that replaced the old eye clinic<br>and provide professional training<br>programs<br>that now largely led and run by<br>the fiji's<br>national university so it was a<br>collaboration with the fiji national<br>university and now<br>the fnu has taken over<br>since 2007 we also been working with<br>a close pastor the divine word<br>university in madan and png<br>to deliver higher quality specialist eye<br>training<br>we are also providing support to the<br>university of papua new guinea which<br>administers<br>alongside support to training and<br>service provision the pacific eye<br>institute has become a center<br>of support to surrounding pacific island<br>countries as well working in close<br>partnership<br>with ministries<br>of health to strengthen eye care systems<br>the institute undertakes coordination<br>and planning<br>cpd<br>outreach<br>clinical governance and maintains<br>regional mentoring and support networks<br>partners<br>around the region<br>we have also supported the establishment<br>of the pat eyes<br>the pacific eye care society which is a<br>professional body of eye care workers in<br>now the pacific eye institute<br>established<br>a facility to support diabetic<br>retinopathy as well<br>funded by the fred hollis foundation<br>and this has been a hub for work<br>throughout<br>the region to provide training and<br>support<br>to<br>diabetic retinopathy services aiming to<br>strengthen diabetic retinopathy<br>prevention<br>screening and early detection<br>and treatment and integration with ncd<br>services<br>as you know in the pacific<br>ncds<br>which means non-communicable disease<br>has<br>based out of pei<br>the institute is also<br>the mobile eye clinic<br>which is a state of the art<br>mobile clinic is about 11.5 meter<br>long and has an operating theater<br>and this mobile eye clinic travels<br>around the main island of fiji which<br>level and also to 100 level as well to<br>provide sight saving services<br>another notable eye clinic is the<br>regional eye center in honeara solomon<br>islands<br>in<br>2015 the threat holders worked with the<br>solomon islands ministry of health<br>to build<br>the regional eye center the center is<br>now owned by the solomon government and<br>is run<br>by a strong cutter of solomon islands<br>eye doctors and nurses most of whom were<br>trained at<br>the pacific eye institute<br>the center is<br>totally off-grid means<br>the power is<br>totally supplied by a solar<br>and also the water source is<br>totally independent as well from the<br>town supply<br>in<br>in tanks<br>so<br>the foundation has built seven eye<br>clinics<br>in the region and currently supporting<br>111<br>across<br>13 countries<br>a lot has been done over the years<br>now over time ophthalmologists and eye<br>care nurses were trained to provide<br>eye care services in their own country<br>as i mentioned<br>previously they were depending on<br>visiting teams coming now they can do it<br>on their own<br>so these teams now provide more<br>consistent<br>and contextually appropriate eye care<br>services<br>in the appropriate<br>so the<br>the regional outreach team consists of<br>pacific ophthalmologists<br>so to date the pacific outreach team has<br>now conducted 62<br>regional outreaches<br>so just a couple of uh<br>weeks ago just want to share with you<br>our team<br>was in samoa<br>after a call from hell from samoa<br>to support the the someone<br>ophthalmologist and her team to provide<br>eye care<br>services to the populations of sawai<br>and<br>upolu<br>so there were a total of 306<br>surgeries were performed<br>and hundreds of<br>patients were<br>skin screened treated<br>examined and treated<br>so the foundation has supported over<br>81 eye surgeries to date<br>and over a million eye consultations in<br>just to give you an idea of how<br>challenging some of these outreach<br>this is us many years ago<br>i was on outreach in vanuatu in toba<br>province stroba province is<br>the most northern part of the country<br>so it's<br>not just like getting off a plane<br>these locations are incredibly remote<br>take a long<br>a boat ride like a single dugout canoe<br>but bigger made of fiberglass we had to<br>take this<br>long<br>travel for more than three hours<br>and we get to a location and we travel<br>for another three hours<br>by road as you can see in the picture<br>carrying this eye equipment to get to<br>the clinic<br>so what is a current eye health<br>situation in the pacific<br>10 million people live in the region<br>and about 10 percent are blind or<br>visually impaired<br>this works out to be around 1 million<br>people with visual impairment<br>including blindness so that is<br>that is a big load that's a<br>so while reliable<br>prevalence data in the pacific islands<br>is limited recent studies<br>show<br>a significance of the problem<br>and<br>our chair has already told you about<br>rapid assessment in png<br>which is uh<br>is quite very very high 5.6 of the<br>population<br>so this is one of the highest rates<br>globally<br>that is a concern<br>to make matters worse more challenging 7<br>out of 10 countries in the world with<br>the highest prevalence of diabetes are<br>located in the pacific<br>as you know diabetic return path is a<br>complication of diabetes<br>so these impacts on our work as well<br>and has been mentioned by previous<br>speakers 9 out of 10 people are blind<br>and they don't need to be blind because<br>they are treatable something can be done<br>for them they don't have to be blind<br>but who's going to do the job<br>the economic impact of restoring site is<br>significant<br>price waterhouse cooper research shows<br>that for every dollar<br>that is invested<br>in trying to restore site in services to<br>restore site<br>one dollar<br>more than four times that is generated<br>injected back into the local economy so<br>that is because once vision is restored<br>people become productive again and not<br>only one people one person if one person<br>is blind<br>but also the carer is also<br>relieved<br>so this is an economically viable<br>solution and sustainable investment to<br>spend some money on eye care<br>so that we save a lot of money<br>so therefore improving eye health<br>contributes to achieving this<br>sustainable development goals where<br>as formally recognized by the un general<br>and this contributes to universal<br>health coverage which the world health<br>organization keeps on talking about<br>asking member countries to work towards<br>to<br>so our health contributes to that<br>it is important to mention in the is to<br>mention is the equitable burden of<br>blindness<br>which is a pattern that we see globally<br>and it is particular<br>evident in the pacific you can see<br>there on the graph the blue bars are<br>male prevalence rates and the orange<br>bars are<br>female<br>so in png<br>61 of blindness is experienced by women<br>yet they are less likely to have<br>any intervention like cataract surgery<br>so this inequity is a concern<br>in addition to these high rates of<br>avoidable blindness and visual<br>impairment there are many challenges<br>in delivering eye care in<br>the region<br>including<br>shortage of eye nurses and after almost<br>still<br>though which have trained still their<br>gaps<br>and particularly of not<br>outside the capital cities in the rural<br>areas<br>and most doctors they want to stay in<br>let's take for example png there are<br>only approximately more than a dozen of<br>thalmulges for population of<br>nine million is it<br>so based on recommended standards like<br>double ho standards<br>png requires at least 80 ophthalmologies<br>there's only about two of<br>only about a dozen<br>that is a big task to<br>to train up this number<br>scattered population is also a barrier<br>isolated remote communities<br>meaning patients have to travel far and<br>access eye care<br>some up to<br>traveling in a boat for blind people in<br>dugout canoes can be<br>a nightmare for blind patients elderly<br>patients<br>in bigger continents like in africa<br>india people can walk from point a to b<br>but in the pacific region you have to<br>travel by sea<br>and the problem is we haven't mastered<br>the art of walking on the sea<br>not a person<br>a higher being<br>like in solomon's 102 they traveled by<br>these fiberglass canoes with powered by<br>by two-stroke engines that is very very<br>high<br>mode of transport high cost<br>so much waste you go to the other places<br>like<br>bangkok<br>they use these four stroke engines in<br>in the engines jutting onto the water<br>and those are four strokes so they<br>consume less fuel<br>and now fuel is skyrocketing<br>skyrocketing<br>also other contributing factors are<br>fear<br>fear of the unknown<br>maybe there's no carers<br>and there's poor health seeking<br>behaviors by pacific people<br>sometimes when you even go closer to<br>them<br>climate change natural disasters<br>tsunamis<br>jesus outbreak look at<br>the volcano in tonga<br>so these are i thought i'll just share<br>also one of the challenges i would like<br>to share with you is the health systems<br>in each country<br>are not well supported<br>by the country's respective ministry of<br>health<br>because they don't prioritize<br>so we aim to advocate and keep on<br>knocking on those<br>for<br>the various minister of health to keep<br>prioritizing eye care<br>and to advocate for dedicated eye health<br>resources in each country<br>of course government budgets<br>are very strict<br>very very stretched particularly now in<br>there's some success in solomon islands<br>it is strong because people like us push<br>hard<br>and<br>in solomons they include<br>budgetary<br>provision for eye care services<br>so in fact solomon islands is the only<br>pacific country which has a budget<br>provision for eye care international<br>health budget both countries still<br>cannot make that happen<br>and budget for eye services are all<br>pulled together in one bag<br>and shared by all clinical specialties<br>which can be so difficult to<br>so in the solomons we have fred hollows<br>foundation and other health development<br>the budget<br>so if we ask questions so other goal<br>posts near where are we<br>what is the end game<br>although we have come so far there's<br>still more to do as our chair has<br>mentioned<br>countries have reached various levels of<br>maturity in their eye care<br>but<br>some of the workers that we're traveling<br>some of the workers<br>are taking in water and need patching<br>the png worker<br>the png worker needs better sales and<br>more hands-on deck<br>so i'm here talking about vacas<br>because we're just like a pacific<br>which has not reached its final<br>destination yet or the end of the<br>journey<br>now unfortunately<br>kovi the bad guy has come in and<br>causing disruption to services<br>for two years most positive countries<br>are not doing anything services have<br>been<br>closed because of<br>kovid<br>and with coupled with<br>very poor i can budget this is<br>creating a lot of<br>challenges and many of the pacific<br>island countries have<br>repurposed budgets<br>for the covered effort<br>so<br>eye care has been disadvantaged<br>kovit has taught us many lessons<br>we have to be resilient<br>and adaptable<br>so i think we are much stronger now<br>after kovid<br>we learned a lot of lessons<br>i have had to figure out how to deliver<br>and<br>with our lecturers<br>how to mentor remotely<br>because of kovid<br>and including supporting students who<br>study remotely for the first time in<br>their home countries<br>so there is a need for ongoing<br>innovation to ensure ik in the region is<br>robust<br>resilient<br>particularly in the current<br>challenging world and it keeps on<br>evolving<br>but the foundation cannot do it alone we<br>will continue to work closely we need to<br>with our partners<br>to ensure fully nationally<br>determined<br>and locally led resilient and<br>sustainable<br>pacific country leaders will remain at<br>the heart of the foundation work we we<br>really need to maintain and strengthen<br>partnerships<br>we must be realistic<br>that supporting eye health system<br>strengthening<br>is a must<br>and must continue to make sure that<br>we sail on we ensure that the<br>sustainability of what we do still<br>continues<br>but one thing is sure<br>one thing is for sure<br>we cannot stop until<br>ikea is accessible<br>to the people<br>of the pacific<br>a difficult<br>so to finish up i will reflect a little<br>bit<br>i think it's my last night<br>on what i am<br>most proud of<br>as of<br>2019 we now have at least one<br>ophthalmologist<br>in all the pacific countries that we<br>with population of over 100 000 each one<br>so we have strong and long-standing<br>partnerships with the training<br>institutions the tertiary institutions<br>the universities<br>and all the ministry of health because<br>we can't do that we cannot<br>be driving this we need to work with the<br>ministry of health<br>and make them also<br>lead and drive this together<br>so we now have good young leaders<br>in the region<br>and motivated<br>it has taken 20 years to build an<br>amazing<br>eye care workforce with our partners<br>20 years<br>but it is in my dream that<br>in the future<br>there will be greater resources from the<br>ministry of health i keep on saying<br>ministry of health<br>only then we will see<br>only then<br>we will have<br>the guarantee that i care will be<br>sustained into the future<br>but just doing one thing it has to be<br>coupled with so many others<br>it is really strong<br>and ensure that it continues on<br>beyond<br>us<br>but for now i know that<br>when i slowly withdraw and step aside<br>icare can still move forward<br>with these young doctors who will<br>continue to<br>nurture the workforce<br>the growing workforce and take care of<br>eye care to the next level<br>so we can finalize our vision<br>of avoidable blindness and<br>vision impairment so maybe by then the<br>flotilla of workers will reach<br>thank you dr john so we're just going to<br>open up for some questions um some time<br>for questions so just raise your hands<br>um thank you so much um for sharing i<br>was just curious if you<br>had a preference um<br>helping pediatric patients or elderly or<br>i just wanted to hear who what's<br>the most rewarding<br>type of patient that you like working<br>with<br>i'm sorry i couldn't hear you well can<br>you repeat again please yes do you do<br>you prefer working with pediatric<br>patients<br>or the elderly or the remote for you<br>who is the most rewarding<br>patient that you work with i'm just<br>curious okay thank you<br>we attend to all types of patients which<br>come but<br>the commonest cause of blindness<br>is<br>cataracts<br>followed by refractive error<br>so<br>yes we do see pediatric patients as well<br>so we attend to them<br>and um<br>yes we<br>we we attend to all sorts of uh<br>patients that come to us<br>whether it's pediatric or<br>or the elderlies but<br>just want to share with you that<br>cataracts is the leading cause of<br>blindness so a lot of<br>patients<br>come with cataracts so there's a lot<br>more cataract surgery that needs to be<br>done<br>but as pediatric patients come in we we<br>um thank you i was just wondering what<br>were some of the preventative measures<br>that you<br>to do with like preventing the<br>sorry you have to speak louder<br>um what were some of the preventative<br>measures that<br>of preventative measures um<br>in everything we do<br>we<br>always make sure that<br>health promotion<br>awareness<br>is in place<br>in all the clinics that we work with<br>we consult patients as well<br>and we work with a minister of health<br>working with the minister of health in<br>terms of having<br>health promotion activities<br>awareness of the public health<br>media talks<br>media like<br>tvs and<br>newspapers<br>but basically<br>the ministry of health in the region are<br>leading health promotion and<br>if they are not we<br>knock on their doors and force ourselves<br>in engage crash to tell them all right<br>we need health promotion for eyes as<br>well for blindness<br>so yes we<br>we place health promotion activities um<br>in<br>very important as well<br>um<br>i hope that answers you<br>um thank you very much for a beautiful<br>presentation<br>um i actually have had cataracts myself<br>but um my question was around<br>what do you think is<br>or are the drivers that are causing that<br>gender disparity for cataracts occurring<br>in<br>females more often than males<br>um<br>yeah thank you for the question uh good<br>anyone including myself irrespective of<br>gender<br>it's just that<br>these studies show that<br>those presenting to the clinics<br>they are less females they're more male<br>so we have to<br>it's a concern to us so we have to do<br>something to address that<br>uh is it health-seeking behavior<br>is it because the<br>the women are kept at home doing cooking<br>and all that or maybe because the the<br>men say you stay home cook i go see the<br>eye doctor<br>or there's so many reasons why that is<br>happening<br>so we we try to address that as well<br>by<br>doing outreaches<br>we try to increase equity<br>we do outreaches closer to the community<br>so that<br>so that those<br>who are left out<br>can come because we are going closer to<br>their doorsteps so these are some of the<br>measures that we take<br>but yes that's a good<br>question<br>and<br>yeah we have to turn that around<br>we have to encourage<br>women to come in<br>to have their eyes checked to get the<br>surgery done<br>you see i i can surgery um usually<br>um<br>people see it back in the pacific region<br>as like uh<br>it's part of aging<br>they say it's okay<br>every old people go blind it's okay you<br>know they they sort of have that<br>mentality so we need to change that<br>yeah<br>so that's why we<br>talked to the minister of health now ik<br>is all right we try to present to them<br>the economics of ats it's important to<br>have eye care so that we fix the blind<br>person the carer is also freed up and<br>the economics of it sort of come in play<br>and to convince politicians policy<br>makers that i care<br>it is<br>it is good to invest in eye care<br>because the returns are good<br>and cataract surgery is one of the most<br>successful<br>medical intervention because you see it<br>straight away it's dramatic the changes<br>you do cardiac surgery you're very happy<br>because you see the results straight<br>away<br>compared to other health medical<br>procedures you have to wait until you<br>see the outcome<br>you have to wait long<br>so we try to preach that we try to talk<br>to<br>our health colleagues our bosses<br>and the politicians<br>that<br>it's not bad<br>doing cataract surgery providing for the<br>blind is a good thing<br>it's good<br>for our economy it's good for our people<br>so<br>when you restore a blind person's site<br>you are reliving you restoring that<br>other person who is caring for the blind<br>you're freeing that person up so the<br>blind patient becomes productive<br>and the the carer becomes productive as<br>well<br>benefit yes thank you i thank you<br>um<br>before i pick when we were outside i<br>picked up your brochure that was there<br>and had a quick flick through it<br>and<br>i just wanted to see if i'm right and<br>assuming<br>that the work of the foundation could<br>progress faster and wider if you had<br>so<br>i was sitting here thinking about the<br>question and i thought<br>perhaps the<br>way of<br>accessing more funding probably comes<br>from the grass roots people in new<br>zealand<br>and so<br>one way i was wondering about addressing<br>that is<br>could the foundation do something like<br>an extensive facebook campaign or social<br>media<br>media campaign to meet the grass<br>to put their<br>need in front of<br>a great greater number of new zealanders<br>just<br>yes that's that's a really really good<br>question and a very important question<br>because<br>yes you are right<br>the dollar sign is important no matter<br>what we do<br>the dollar sign is very important<br>because it makes it happen<br>as well you need the dollar sign you<br>need the money<br>to train more people you need the money<br>to<br>to get more supplies you need the money<br>for equipment everything training<br>so yes we we are very thankful to the<br>the kind the generosity of the new<br>zealand public<br>who<br>give freely<br>popular one is you give 26 dollars you<br>help<br>a blind person see again<br>that is quite popular because<br>people see that 26 donors is very little<br>but if they put the 26 dollars they can<br>get a blind person c again so that's<br>quite a a powerful<br>tool i would say<br>so yes we need and we are very fortunate<br>that we have a lot of<br>partners we have a lot of<br>stakeholders and a lot of donors who<br>donate<br>we have kind new zealand donors<br>who come and put in money and we have<br>corporate donors as well<br>but yes every single penny counts<br>to to move<br>our<br>our cause<br>our mission<br>all right thank you dr zatu uh for the<br>amazing work so you're doing uh i'm just<br>wondering what a patient journeys<br>looks like on a typical day at one of<br>those outreach centers sir<br>yes so<br>you would see in one of the slides in<br>vanuatu for example<br>because the islands are scattered<br>some you know like in fiji you have two<br>main islands road system is good some<br>countries the road systems are not very<br>good so some have to travel by canoe<br>some have to travel by land<br>you know up the hills the mountains down<br>across the rivers up against so<br>they they could be traveling for days we<br>have sometimes<br>in uh parts of the pacific where<br>they they could travel for two or three<br>days to get to the center<br>so<br>that is a challenge for patients so<br>sometimes the foundation<br>moves in to help<br>patients come closer so we we aid<br>we<br>help with the transportation costs as<br>well<br>and we've had donors who<br>wanted to put in for<br>for transportation<br>because that is one of the challenges<br>that<br>impedes the work<br>reducing the<br>the patients<br>turn up<br>uptake of services<br>a nurse could go<br>a screening team can go for example<br>a quite a common scenario is<br>the screen team goes and screens say 200<br>patients for surgery<br>and once the team goes in<br>only 60 70 patients turn up<br>because they had problems with<br>the challenges that i have shared with<br>you in my in my talk you know fear of<br>the unknown<br>uh<br>carers not having time<br>prioritizing eye care<br>and so many other things transportation<br>costs so we try to remove some of these<br>barriers so that<br>people it will increase the uptake of<br>services more people will come but it's<br>been<br>difficult<br>as well coupled with<br>you know health-seeking behaviors as<br>well<br>and all these things put together<br>so<br>yeah so<br>we need to address all these things but<br>we we can't<br>we can't have the answer immediately it<br>has it's a long journey for us to<br>keep on striving to<br>to try to remove some of those barriers<br>i just want to acknowledge the work that<br>you do with the foundation<br>and in our pacific communities it's<br>truly something special and i know that<br>a lot of us have family members that<br>have experienced some sort of eyesight<br>issues<br>something that i wanted to touch on was<br>a population that is often<br>i guess outcasted or people don't like<br>to talk about them and if we do they're<br>discriminated against because they're<br>not citizens in our countries and i<br>don't only speak for people in new<br>zealand<br>i guess<br>in layman's terms overstayers<br>i'll say as it is and i know people<br>don't like to talk about it but the<br>reality of our pacific peoples is we do<br>exist in many countries as overstayers<br>and we do have eyesight problems so my<br>question that i'm posing to you this<br>evening is is the fred hollows<br>foundation a safe space for our families<br>to come to you and work in partnership<br>with our family members that are<br>experiencing eyesight problems is this a<br>safe space for us to come and work in<br>partnership with you to help our family<br>members<br>yes i don't have all the answers for you<br>but<br>yeah the foundation can look at it<br>to be able to support<br>the families in<br>and<br>families out there in the pacific region<br>as well<br>and<br>sometimes when we go to visit uh one<br>pacific island country<br>we've had<br>we've had requests from<br>uh from new zealand saying oh i have got<br>an auntie i've got an uncle there well i<br>have this community here can they come<br>so we tell them yes<br>uh tell them we'll be arriving on so and<br>so date and we can<br>we can provide surgery for them<br>uh but for pacific uh people staying in<br>in new zealand uh i'm not sure how we<br>can go about that but<br>i don't have answers for that<br>but i think<br>it's something that needs to<br>to be explored and looked at<br>but i don't have the answer for you at<br>the moment but yes partnerships we can<br>you can<br>have a relationship with<br>fred hollis foundation see how<br>pacific communities can receive this<br>treatment<br>it's not<br>it's not rocket science we can<br>make that happen<br>somehow<br>like fred hollis is saying nothing is<br>impossible<br>we can do<br>hello um<br>my name is irene and<br>my sister and i are just here on behalf<br>of the solomon island community<br>in dunedin<br>dr john thank you so much for everything<br>that you do and the work that you have<br>done to<br>inspire others one of our really close<br>friends is one of the ophthalmologists<br>that works in the honyara eye clinic<br>and her<br>her stories of the work that is done<br>across the solomons has has majorly<br>affected our family we believe that you<br>possibly<br>did eye surgery on our own mother<br>back in the day and we have seen the<br>wonderful work that the fred hollows<br>foundation does for our people<br>and for our families i can tell you that<br>where i live in where our home village<br>is is many many miles away to travel to<br>get there<br>you must travel by boat for eight hours<br>by truck for ten hours and then canoe<br>for another two or three hours<br>our family members there<br>are always lacking<br>in<br>eye care<br>the mobile<br>facility is incredible and the fact that<br>our people can get access<br>it's not just about<br>the ability to travel it is the<br>responsibilities that our family members<br>have in the villages<br>and their inability to be able to leave<br>people that they're caring for or<br>helping in order to go and get eye care<br>and i think that's another reason that<br>women are<br>unable to<br>to perhaps leave those duties and<br>responsibilities to be able to go so<br>thank you so much for sharing thank you<br>so much for your own sacrifices<br>and for inspiring<br>and<br>wow it's so great to see<br>my one talks here attend<br>this lecture<br>i i feel so good thank you for coming<br>and<br>yes<br>i think i know where you come from<br>we never miss<br>a destination we always go there to do<br>surgery so i must have operated on your<br>relative yeah<br>you we've got one more that's good all<br>these questions so it's good but dr john<br>will be around here afterwards as well<br>so<br>uh doctor i i don't know that i've got a<br>an incorrect impression but it seems to<br>me that the concentrated<br>attention is on cataract surgery but in<br>your photograph there are an awful lot<br>of children<br>what sort of blindness do children<br>contract<br>it's incomprehensible to me that little<br>ones are blind<br>why does this happen<br>yes thank you that's a good uh question<br>so you can you could see that one of the<br>pictures<br>is a child with uh<br>it's a child with cataracts so you can<br>have cataract in children as well<br>so we do cataract surgery for the<br>children as well<br>so that's uh we call that congenital<br>cataracts<br>so it's not only<br>elderly as well i was talking about just<br>numbers<br>that most of them<br>the leading course globally<br>and also in the pacific is still<br>catholics<br>so<br>where there is there's so much<br>volume so much<br>burden so much patient load<br>we invest more on that<br>but we don't forget the others as well<br>so we still take care of the others<br>which are not not as uh common as<br>uh catalan but yeah just to share with<br>you<br>um<br>united nations now has uh<br>increased<br>the<br>the eye health up there<br>so they have fast resolution that i<br>health<br>must be included in all member countries<br>business<br>as<br>as a program as<br>and also the world health assembly has<br>also<br>its um<br>importance placing importance in uh<br>in<br>eye health as well so they have asked<br>all member countries<br>and most and all pacific island<br>countries are member countries of who<br>and the targets they have given is<br>that all countries<br>by the year 2030 must increase cataract<br>services and reflective error services<br>by<br>30 to 40 percent point increase<br>so that is something that is one message<br>that i<br>keep on reminding the<br>the policy makers the minister of health<br>that we we need to start looking at that<br>because you guys you signed up to it and<br>they they will ask you to present what<br>you have done for eye care for eye<br>health<br>by<br>2030 by the year 2030 so<br>so it's that's that's uh who has<br>challenged all the countries including<br>pacific island countries to do something<br>for eye health for blindness<br>such a wonderful question so it's just<br>great to see such a great<br>round of questions so<br>just on behalf of everybody<br>just put a
