reality<br>takawangawa<br>um<br>good evening everyone um my name is<br>Richard Blakey I'm the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor for research and Enterprise<br>here at the University of otago from<br>Dunedin um<br>and it's my great pleasure on behalf of<br>the vice chancellor who can't be here<br>tonight he is in Canada<br>um<br>often he will try and uh and look in on<br>ipl's if he's away but I imagine the<br>time zones in Canada means that he may<br>not be joining us tonight but it is my<br>pleasure to act on his behalf to welcome<br>you here tonight to the inaugural<br>professorial lecture of Professor Brent<br>Lovelock<br>oh come on in welcome welcome and Thrice<br>welcome<br>um<br>ipl's a wonderful occasion for<br>um<br>the inaugural Professor although they<br>are probably sometimes rather nervous<br>occasions for for the uh the person uh<br>they are wonderful occasions for uh our<br>academic Community I know as academic<br>leaders in the University we look<br>forward to these as times where we can<br>unplug from the administration and other<br>matters of the day and just reflect on<br>the outstanding achievements in teaching<br>research and service that our fine<br>academic staff undertake<br>um in in discharging their duties as<br>members of our academic staff and being<br>awarded the status of professor at the<br>University of otago is no mean feat<br>particularly to be promoted from within<br>we set very high standards and we go<br>through a very rigorous promotion<br>process whereby we demand and require<br>outstanding performance across all of<br>the components that make up an academic<br>role of teaching of research and of<br>service and we Benchmark that against<br>the highest International standards by<br>using referees we also look for strength<br>and leadership in these promotions to<br>differentiate that professorial role<br>from other roles in the University so<br>congratulations Brent on that<br>or albeit that your promotion was some<br>time ago and this uh the celebration of<br>it has been delayed by ourselves and<br>other things<br>so as well as a celebration for our<br>academic Community it's also one where<br>we welcome members of the public and for<br>those members of the public here or<br>online welcome welcome and Thrice<br>welcome and in particular we're often<br>members of um uh families of um of the<br>professor and other uh significant<br>people in their lives are present and I<br>have some shout outs for a number of<br>people Rebecca Jason Amelia Oliver and<br>Tom<br>Hobbs and Neve and a car is here kyota<br>anna so to to your whanau welcome uh to<br>Jessica Thompson and matariki Inwood<br>welcome to you too and I understand<br>Brent that your children may and<br>probably are online right now from the<br>US or the UK that's Levi Millie and<br>Oscar so to welcome in others uh others<br>who are beaming in from a far welcome my<br>role is very simple I just have to say<br>how proud we are as a university to be<br>celebrating the achievements of a new<br>professor I have really enjoyed in my<br>time here bring in with other colleagues<br>in the Department of Tourism interacting<br>with you and know that you bring forward<br>those qualities of an academic that we<br>we really really value in connecting<br>your research and your teaching to<br>people<br>your students<br>look up to you as an outstanding<br>supervised you're highly sought out<br>after for supervision your research<br>connects to communities and I got direct<br>experience of that in 2018 sitting on a<br>panel with you in invercargill for the<br>winter Symposium Series where I I<br>learned what a difference you have made<br>to communities within our theater from<br>waiheke to the catlins and Beyond in<br>your role as<br>a practically minded academic who looks<br>to apply their knowledge to the needs<br>and interests of communities I will<br>always remember<br>the person from the catlins talking<br>about the the work that you had done to<br>to develop and help them develop their<br>Regional tourism strategies so that your<br>work is leaves an indelible and enduring<br>mark on the communities of Art Heroes so<br>from me and from the University<br>congratulations on your promotion it's<br>now my pleasure to hand over to<br>Professor Robin Gould the pro Vice<br>Chancellor in the division of com this<br>Goldsmith edlam gold hockey Colma gilray<br>uh well very very warm welcome to<br>everyone here this evening and a very<br>very special welcome and acknowledgment<br>to Brent's whanau thank you very much<br>for for joining us here this evening<br>this is a very very special occasion as<br>Professor Blakey has outlined already so<br>I won't say too much further about that<br>but what I do want to say is that<br>Professor Brent Lovelock is a social<br>scientist with a passion for advancing<br>sustainable tourism through his research<br>teaching and service<br>he joined otago and the tourism<br>Department in 1999 as an assistant<br>lecturer being awarded his PhD then from<br>otago in 2001 and he has since built an<br>impressive as Prof Blake has already<br>said and diverse career working on<br>everything from coffee tourism and<br>Rwanda through to sustainable tourism in<br>the catlins he has risen steadily<br>through the ranks to be promoted to full<br>professor in 2019 and then hit a<br>department in 2020 a role in which he<br>currently continues to serve<br>so Brent's research considers how we<br>might manage tourism more efficient more<br>effectively and he's had over 80<br>peer-reviewed Publications in the field<br>including a co-authored book the ethics<br>of Tourism<br>now this book challenges us to consider<br>more ethical approaches to managing the<br>industry which is of increasing<br>relevance today of course<br>and now I'm a great fan of books not<br>only because you can hold them but also<br>as books represent a depth of<br>investigation and Analysis that often<br>catches multiple dimensions of one's<br>work and thinking so I've gone and<br>looked at some of the reviews of of the<br>book and reviewers have written of the<br>book that the ethics of Tourism is an<br>important addition towards tourism<br>sustainability Theory it has an inner<br>structure that's easy to follow combined<br>with a novelty approach and practical<br>application it's enjoyable to read and<br>could be appreciated by both academics<br>and a more General audience another<br>reviewer said that the ethics of Tourism<br>is a significant contribution to the<br>tourism literature it provides the first<br>comprehensive review of Ethics across<br>the breadth of travel and tourism<br>experiences<br>now Brent values engaging his students<br>on this topic is they will play and<br>already do a crucial role as our next<br>generation of sustainable tourism<br>managers<br>Brent's published work has been<br>impressive and impact scopus and those<br>of us who are academics will know all<br>about scopus lists almost 1 000<br>citations as of today and in each index<br>of 19. Google Scholar lists<br>2182 citations as of today with an H<br>index of 27 and an I-10 index of 51<br>which is very impressive<br>Brent has held visiting appointments in<br>Japan and India and works with a range<br>of collaborators globally from Iran<br>through to Norway<br>he supervised 20 PhD students to<br>completion in a range of areas of<br>sustained sustainable tourism and as<br>part of a university-wide team that has<br>undertaken a seven-year program of<br>research on education for sustainability<br>Brent and his collaborators have<br>received multiple research grants and<br>undertaken numerous research<br>consultancies for government industry<br>and Community Partners in 2020 he was<br>awarded as principal investigator a<br>prestigious and highly competitive<br>Marsden Grant under the title of bad<br>nature the social dimensions of invasive<br>alien species and their Management in<br>New Zealand which corresponds very<br>closely to the title for tonight's<br>lecture so without further Ado Deputy<br>device Chancellor and those here this<br>evening I am delighted to now invite<br>Professor Brent Lovelock to deliver his<br>can you hear me<br>you can<br>uh wonderful<br>thank you everyone for turning up<br>tonight<br>um some of you might be in the wrong<br>room of course you might be looking for<br>Val McDermott who's a Scottish crime<br>writer<br>but too late because the doors are<br>locked and so you're not going anywhere<br>I'm afraid<br>um<br>no but sincerely it's great to see<br>everyone here it was really really very<br>nice<br>um<br>so it's also a lot strange because it's<br>been a long time since I've actually<br>given a lecture to anyone more than<br>perhaps two people face to face because<br>of covert so and it's also a little<br>strange as as Richard said I first<br>learned about my professorial promotion<br>in 2018 late 2018<br>in those days the vice Chancellor would<br>ring each professorial applicant up and<br>give them the good or bad news<br>and I remember getting a uh a phone<br>calls it's about six months after I<br>applied for a professorship I got a<br>phone call from harleen Hayne who was<br>the VC at the time<br>and she told me the good news and she<br>said it's fantastic bring to the<br>unanimous decision you've been made Prof<br>and I said thanks very much harleen<br>that's that's a wonderful put the phone<br>down and I basked in my glory for a few<br>seconds and the phone rang again<br>and the voice said it's Harley and<br>Hayden here again Brent and I said to<br>her you made a mistake didn't you<br>yeah she said yes I was looking at the<br>um so I just got to show that Vice<br>chances can have a sense of humor so<br>thank you very much<br>um so<br>tonight I'm just going to try to explain<br>why a tourism Professor has such a a<br>wacky title up there about invasive<br>species I suppose tourists can be<br>conceived as aliens so there was a<br>connection there so I just want to chart<br>my pathway of getting into this type of<br>research and then to skip across some of<br>what I think are quite cool or exciting<br>little bits of research I've done then<br>we'll finish off talking about the<br>Marsden project which we've got funded<br>for recently<br>so um without any further Ado let's let<br>me<br>uh<br>so<br>that's my home my homeland the green<br>green lands of the manawatu that<br>ecological disaster Zone whereas raised<br>on a dairy farm there constantly leaning<br>into the sort of Westerly winds that<br>howled across as if there was a giant<br>Dyson vacuum cleaner stuck in the<br>manawatu good sort of sucking everything<br>towards it<br>um beautiful I was a flatlander<br>those are my four beers and they've did<br>a very very effective job of removing<br>almost every Vestige of native<br>vegetation and the manawatu planes and<br>so uh basically the only<br>remaining uh indication that there was<br>would have been 30 meter high you know<br>Potter cup Forest there<br>um was this tiny little wee bit of<br>native uh esplanium which grew right<br>under a bridge that went across one of<br>the streams on our farm and it was so<br>tucked in there that the cows couldn't<br>couldn't get to it and little it off and<br>it was I was always sort of quite<br>fascinated there was this this weird<br>alien Little Creek to me was alien even<br>though it was a native species and it<br>was hiding there for many many years and<br>in fact the only indication that that<br>land was once the land of the rangatani<br>people was actually a Maori ads that my<br>great-great-grandfather had plowed up<br>and sat on his mentalpiece in his house<br>so a flat Lander<br>and these are the obligatory<br>embarrassing photographs of of yourself<br>and your child is my mum and dad and my<br>and my middle brother Greg down at<br>hermitangi beach where again we were<br>invaded by alien blue bottles and my<br>regular gets stung down there great<br>Beach<br>love that<br>and there's me with one of my calves<br>because it was my my duty of course to<br>work on the farmers when I was little<br>and I helped to feed the carbs and they<br>had a champion calf every year basically<br>and I used to chop thistles for 35 cents<br>an hour and I remember my dad's face<br>when I asked him for a pay rise to 50<br>cents an hour<br>um and that was another way of<br>contacting those invasive species way<br>back in the day and of course I became a<br>super child and then a super researcher<br>apparently<br>and then I became interested in in<br>hunting shooting killing things not sure<br>if I'm allowed to say that out loud but<br>we used to go yielding down in the<br>creeks and our farm and in the<br>neighbor's Farms<br>and I know what you're thinking who's<br>that creepy kid with the guns<br>um that's me and that was when I worked<br>for the for the forest service in a<br>little Hut stuck up in the forest in the<br>middle of nowhere well that was another<br>another sort of I guess second contact<br>with invasive species which was shooting<br>rabbits and and possums we used to I<br>might had a little Volkswagen Beetle and<br>we used to take the front Bonnet off and<br>and<br>um I used to sit in the front there<br>wedged in behind the little petrol tank<br>and cruise around the back roads of the<br>manawatu shooting possums and and<br>rabbits and anything we could actually<br>see<br>um<br>and so then I invited the future where I<br>would actually<br>um engage with nature as my career so I<br>invented the future where I would<br>actually be traveling around all the<br>national parks of New Zealand by<br>helicopter preferably<br>and then dropping into these wonderful<br>places and and and doing whatever I<br>would do<br>so I applied for a forest service Cadet<br>ship and was lucky to get one<br>um and then spent a year of course in<br>amongst pine trees as you do and this is<br>a photograph of me and my fellow<br>Forester trainees back in 19 God knows<br>79 and that's familiar with the funny<br>little blue hat in the middle there and<br>ironically we have these bags on our<br>backs our planting bags and we were<br>planting large actually then this was<br>introduced European large we were<br>planting large up in the highlands of<br>the wakarara ranges in in the Hawkes Bay<br>so over the top of native tussocks and<br>any other native vegetation that might<br>have been there and we thought that was<br>a wonderful thing to do in those days of<br>course we learn our lessons don't we<br>after forestry school I went to<br>Canterbury and did a honors degree<br>that's that's him there<br>the sultry looking one but there you go<br>and so after forestry school of course<br>it was bonded to the New Zealand forest<br>service and then we had to apply for a<br>job somewhere in the country and I<br>thought it'd be nice to go to Northland<br>so I applied for Northland and got sent<br>to Southland<br>um invercargill that they precise<br>and ended up<br>doing the job that I had actually<br>dreamed about<br>which was flying around helicopters from<br>National Park to National Park and<br>undertaking a monitoring program for the<br>impacts of invasive species that is<br>mainly deer and possums and Hayes and<br>and what have you<br>so it was a dream job and we would use a<br>combination of different methods we<br>would use vegetation plus we would have<br>to count and measure the diameters of<br>everything that was growing there and<br>we'd do bird surveys<br>and we also had this other method and it<br>was called fecal palette monitoring<br>so I became a sketologist which is an<br>expert in the poos of a range of<br>different species<br>so if I can look at a possum poo like<br>like that's possum poo there and I can<br>tell you I can tell you how old it is I<br>can tell you what the person had for<br>breakfast and what was on his mind that<br>day<br>um<br>and ironically we've made some of the<br>times up up there in the forest we made<br>friends with the animals that we were<br>supposed to be monitoring with the view<br>to leading to eradication and this is a<br>little possum called Benji that we used<br>to feed from one of the Huts that we<br>based ourselves in for<br>a few months actually we got in big<br>trouble over that because the director<br>general of the forest service came to<br>visit us and he and the possum came to<br>the window going to<br>um and ironically another part of the<br>job was also looking at invasive species<br>which were considered to be invasive<br>species then this was a photograph taken<br>up behind Queenstown in a place called<br>Mount Orem which was a recreation of<br>Scenic Reserve I can't recall and so<br>these are plantings of exotic um<br>European Pines that were planted there<br>to actually stabilize their country<br>Cycles was very very slip erosion prone<br>and so our job was to go in there and<br>report on these species to see if they<br>were surviving adequately<br>and of course again it's wonderful how<br>things can change over the years of<br>course now those species have been<br>sprayed and disappeared but I remember<br>writing a report that recommended that<br>these species actually we increase our<br>um but all good things must come to an<br>end and so my days as the environmental<br>Forest are of Southland Conservancy for<br>the New Zealand Forest Service ended in<br>1987 with the end of the forest service<br>and when Department of Conservation was<br>created<br>and so I returned up to the Manawa II up<br>to my homeland and worked for Doc up<br>there for a number of years<br>um in some different roles one of them<br>was engaging with landowners through the<br>protected Natural Area program trying to<br>protect little areas of pockets the few<br>little pockets of native vegetation that<br>remained in the Manawa too<br>um there's a photograph of me in my dark<br>uniform just to prove that that's what<br>the doc uniform was was pretty cool in<br>those days actually they weren't doc<br>issued motorcycles sadly but yeah<br>um so I worked with wonderful people up<br>there like Ross castles and Don Ravine<br>and worked with some pretty amazingly<br>and uh difficult invasive species as<br>well including spartina grass and old<br>man's beard or clematus vitaba<br>but a lot of the time that I was working<br>there for doc on conservation planning<br>and Recreation planning<br>I had this there was this sort of<br>conflict going on because I thought<br>the doctor were going through some very<br>difficult times then in fact I couldn't<br>even afford to run some Vehicles I'd put<br>the vehicles up on blocks because they<br>couldn't afford the staff or the fuel to<br>actually run them and from my<br>perspective there was<br>some of the the budget or funding from<br>Doc was actually used in areas that were<br>perhaps less important and one of those<br>areas was was around managing tourism<br>and Recreation<br>at the time there was no real strategy<br>for how to do this sustainably in New<br>Zealand we had this as a New Zealand we<br>had a goal of getting three million<br>visitors to into the country by the year<br>2000 or something ridiculous like that<br>but that it has much sort of rationale<br>behind it as a fish burger it was just<br>it was just a silly thing to do so I<br>wanted to then<br>sort of investigator and visit how we<br>could have a sustainable nature-based<br>tourism and Recreation policy in New<br>Zealand and so I I left Doc and<br>approached a guy who's<br>a bit of a hero of mine Michael Hall<br>who's based up in Canterbury at the<br>moment but he was at the time at<br>Canberra University and I very shyly<br>asked him if I could be his PhD student<br>and he said go on then and so I'm backed<br>up by PhD which looked at sustainable<br>tourism management and I did my field<br>work in Canada in places like this at<br>Banff which<br>are renowned for the level of visitor<br>pressure Banff National Park it's about<br>five million visitors a year a huge<br>amount of pressure on on the communities<br>that live there and on the ecosystems<br>but Canada also was was my choice of<br>field site because they have amazing<br>mechanisms for coming to negotiated<br>outcomes in these difficult types for<br>um there's a photograph of me doing we<br>switched with a Canadian participant<br>just to prove that I was actually in<br>Canada at the time<br>and the outcome of that in my PhD well<br>one of the papers I think which was the<br>second paper that I published was why<br>it's good to be bad<br>um the role of conflict and as the title<br>suggests conflict was actually a key<br>ingredient for actually coming to<br>sustainable outcomes for for national<br>parks at that time<br>so this this interest-based negotiation<br>or the touchy fairly lovey-dovey<br>approaches weren't actually working as a<br>conflict was was the winner at the end<br>of the day<br>don't worry I'm not going to go through<br>all of my my Publications one by one<br>so I did one of these little wordy<br>things where you can I throw all the<br>titles of my papers and chapters and<br>what have you into this sort of mixing<br>machine like a big sort of tumble mixer<br>and produce this little diagram which<br>shows what your key sort of focuses Foci<br>from your research oh that's a<br>photograph of me when I was young and<br>fresh face in my first year as a<br>lecturer my god I've been beaten down<br>but you can see that there's different<br>areas of focus there in fact I remember<br>James<br>when he was hod back in the year Dart in<br>our Department of Tourism James high and<br>Professor James Heim coming to me to<br>have a chat about my research focus and<br>he strongly suggested that I just choose<br>one subject and just focus on that for<br>my entire academic career<br>great advice James I ignored James and<br>went on to actually just as this<br>picture here represents look at a number<br>of different uh topics<br>um and so if we had to sort of come up<br>with a menu for what my research focuses<br>Foci that's a silly word isn't it<br>um have been over the last 20 years this<br>would be the menu so I was an appetizer<br>we have consumptive Wildlife tourism<br>okay that's that's not about tourists<br>within nasty cough it's it's about<br>um Wildlife tourism that consumes<br>wildlife in a physical way like hunting<br>shooting and fishing basically<br>it's a consent of wildlife tourism a<br>little bit of sustainable tourism<br>planning and the main course there<br>nature-based Recreation<br>another option of ethical tourism and<br>then for dessert invasive species<br>okay so that's what I was through some<br>of those now<br>I've always had an interest as I said<br>before on on hunting and shooting and<br>fishing and that's me as a kid with the<br>shooting a hair just to vote your eyes<br>if you don't like that type of thing<br>um and so I did a number of pieces of<br>research looking at the economics of<br>hunting looking at the ethics of hunting<br>and eventually coming off the theater to<br>collection on tourism and the<br>consumption of wildlife which I think<br>was a sort of at first at the time<br>because people hadn't really I don't<br>know tourism researchers tend to engage<br>more with the sort of lovey-dovey touchy<br>feeler side of tourism in terms of<br>ecoterrorism and didn't really want to<br>get involved with the sort of Blood and<br>Guts side of of that Wildlife tourism so<br>um and I still do dabble in that area of<br>research in fact the Mars and research<br>that we're doing now but also some<br>research that I completed recently in<br>Japan on sabbatical a couple of years<br>ago<br>um involved hunting and shooting and<br>fishing and and the project in Japan is<br>quite interesting because over there<br>they have this explosion of wild pigs<br>and and deer<br>and there are some huge ramifications<br>for that in terms of the huge damage to<br>to forests to Agriculture and also<br>actually<br>impacting upon society as well in terms<br>of actual attacks on individuals so wild<br>pigs their range are increasing and so<br>they're encroaching on urban areas and<br>they have no fear of humans because that<br>that hardly ever hunted now<br>so the the population of hunters has<br>declined to almost no hunters in Japan<br>because of the Aging population because<br>of of<br>um Urban growth and Rural depopulation<br>and a number of other factors it's very<br>really difficult to get a firearms<br>license in Japan for example really<br>really expensive and it takes a long<br>long time to get it<br>um so all these factors have impacted<br>upon upon hunting<br>so at the moment the Japanese government<br>has embarked on this program of trying<br>to actually<br>um encourage the Japanese people to eat<br>the problem<br>okay uh because the Japanese people have<br>lost the appetite for eating game meat<br>or GBA as it's called over in in Japan<br>so there's a program trying to encourage<br>people to eat wild boar in Assisi and<br>also the venison from the secret deer so<br>both of those are native species through<br>Japan<br>but the problem that and what we're<br>trying to do is actually to force it on<br>the children start with the children and<br>so the the school lunches that they're<br>actually sneaking in some of this Wild<br>game meat there into the school lunches<br>and the kids thought yeah I don't really<br>like that very much and so it's probably<br>a counterproductive move in the long run<br>I think<br>um and uh but there are other obstacles<br>as well they're trying to encourage<br>Japanese housewives to buy this this<br>venison from the deer but of course<br>deer in Japan<br>they are a sacred animal and and you<br>know in in Buddhism they are sort of the<br>revered<br>um dear as a creature there so they have<br>this sort of sort of like a deity in<br>Japan and also in Japan you go to quite<br>a number of places where there are these<br>deer parks and there's some photographs<br>from excuse me Nara<br>um Deer Park now as the ancient Capital<br>so this is the Imperial deer herd and so<br>you've got Japanese people like engaging<br>very close I was there and I got bitten<br>on the bum by one of these deer because<br>I thought I had some food in my pocket<br>so there's a huge obstacles in trying to<br>eat the problem to try to<br>um address this invasive species problem<br>so this was a part of what I call my R3<br>research so R3 is is Recruitment and<br>Retention and reactivation of people<br>engaged in hunting and fishing or or<br>basically any recreational activity it<br>could be golf or anything like that<br>and so these are three models and<br>they're mainly European or American sort<br>of centric models and they don't really<br>take into account these sort of I guess<br>these cultures that have<br>a long history of of Engagement with<br>these species in a quite a different<br>manner than what we have in sort of<br>settler societies<br>um and so looking at those religious<br>um aspects was a way of actually<br>reshaping that and reconceptualizing<br>those models of of recruitment<br>so<br>uh of course in New Zealand we don't<br>have a problem with eating the problem<br>and we like eating the problem<br>and there's some Hunters taking home the<br>problem to eat<br>we eat a lot of game meat in fact I'm<br>involved in some really cool research<br>with colleagues at Lincoln University<br>led by Dr gibber your diggeragi and<br>we've just completed a survey of a<br>thousand New Zealand hunters and we're<br>looking at at how they're using Game<br>meat for food security and of course<br>food security is a huge issue in New<br>Zealand today and especially with<br>declining incomes well<br>the declining spending power of our<br>incomes<br>and so we can't really see the results<br>yet but just some really early<br>indicative results I mean 80 probably 90<br>actually I think just from memory of<br>Hunter's um fine game meat a very good<br>substitute for store-bought meat and<br>over 80 of hunters actually rely upon<br>this meat for feeding their families<br>so invasive species you know you could<br>say Predator free New Zealand get rid of<br>all invasive species but we have a large<br>sector of our society that have Reliant<br>um<br>somehow we've got on to this okay so<br>this is um the next little branch of my<br>research which looks at tourism ethics<br>um<br>and<br>so I was interested in how we can do<br>tourism better and how tourism can<br>better for<br>for people helping through tourism<br>ethically basically and so I engaged on<br>a couple of projects working with travel<br>agents and looking at what type of<br>advice they would give to people who<br>want to travel to really dangerous<br>places where they could get seriously<br>harmed or what sort of advice I'd give<br>to people who they think might be<br>traveling for nefarious purposes like I<br>don't know perhaps a middle-aged guy<br>might come in and want to travel to a<br>destination which is renowned for sex<br>tourism but with children<br>so what do you do in those situations<br>and so that was interesting research<br>because it showed how these travel<br>agents as as I guess ethical agents sort<br>of removed themselves from their ethical<br>decision making and distance themselves<br>um so I applied this What's called the<br>moral intensity sort of framework so I<br>mean they had no responsibility for<br>something which would happen ten<br>thousand kilometers away or twenty<br>thousand kilometers away which was quite<br>interesting<br>so then I took this research further and<br>thought well okay<br>there are some places that perhaps<br>shouldn't be visited<br>and so I tried to depict what the world<br>would look like if we decided all of a<br>sudden we cut we made this rule this law<br>you're not allowed to travel to anywhere<br>which has a human rights violation<br>Aha and so I used a combination of Human<br>Rights Watch uh ratings for every<br>country in the world and international<br>visitor arrival data and I came up with<br>these two scenarios okay so the red<br>countries are where you're not allowed<br>to visit<br>okay so we can see quite a few countries<br>there<br>um and everywhere else you're allowed to<br>visit okay so I redistributed regionally<br>those that those visitor numbers from<br>those banned countries and I had two<br>scenarios this is the extreme scenario<br>so you get some countries that would<br>benefit hugely from such an amazing rule<br>okay Poland Spain you'd benefit hugely<br>Indonesia would benefit hugely Japan<br>would benefit hugely from that Regional<br>re-spreading of the love the numbers of<br>visitors of Tourism<br>okay silly idea I love that paper<br>strangely enough<br>it's one of my least sighted papers<br>in fact I think I only had two citations<br>that I checked the other day and that's<br>because I chose I chose this Outlet<br>which basically the journal has no<br>internet presence whatsoever and so for<br>any any young researchers see that's the<br>wisdom of actually choosing your<br>publication Outlet very very carefully<br>I'm sure it would be cited hundreds if<br>not thousands of times if I'd gone into<br>somewhere else<br>and this is where I sort of I come clean<br>and say well actually I have visited<br>some of those countries and had a very<br>good time here thank you very much<br>um and these are some photographs this<br>one's on my office door actually so<br>people will be familiar with that that's<br>visiting uh Myanmar back in<br>1996 I think that was and this is<br>Myanmar again which I had a bit of a<br>love affair with Myanmar again and<br>on a tourism field trip that's me<br>holding hands with a a Myanmar General<br>um so yeah I'm in with the Myanmar<br>military<br>okay another bit of research and again<br>around the sort of ethical lines and how<br>can tourism do good for certain<br>Community communities or certain sort of<br>segments of society and this was looking<br>at tourism and disability<br>and this bit of research was actually<br>sparked by<br>a newspaper article in the audit where<br>um these developers wanted to put a<br>monorail from what would go from<br>Queenstown through to Milford Sound and<br>at the time a lot of people thought this<br>was hugely destructive because it was<br>going to mow through all this beautiful<br>beach forest and I and I agreed with<br>that what really niggled me when I read<br>the article was that they mentioned that<br>um<br>this will provide access to those who<br>are aged and infirm<br>access to nature for them and I thought<br>this was quite disingenuous and it<br>wasn't really dosing any data and I<br>thought it was actually really<br>exploiting people with disabilities and<br>the age at people with Mobility<br>disabilities and using them for their<br>sort of Nefarious means of getting their<br>proposal approved so I decided to<br>undertake This research<br>involving people with disabilities as<br>participants in the project to see well<br>what do you really want in terms of your<br>contact with nature and and I found that<br>they don't want these large-scale big<br>developments through the middle of beach<br>Forest they want improved contact better<br>contact with nature but mainly through<br>small-scale developments through you<br>know wheelchair tracks and through and<br>through better paths and and what have<br>you but not this type of stuff but also<br>this was<br>pretty much shot down these developers<br>um arguments and Flames now another<br>little bit of research continuing that<br>sort of Ethics theme is around medical<br>tourism<br>and this is some research which I<br>undertook with uh Dr Kirsten from the<br>Department of Defender from social<br>medicine and<br>uh<br>we engaged with a group of medical<br>tourists New Zealand medical tourists<br>who had come had traveled overseas and<br>come back after receiving treatment<br>overseas and so we were interested in<br>their experiences how they felt about<br>the ethics of medical tourism and what<br>their actual<br>experiences their medical<br>experiences were while over there in the<br>destination and then upon return to New<br>Zealand and of course there were huge<br>variations in what those people did<br>experience and some people had wonderful<br>experiences the life-saving experiences<br>and other people had a very very<br>terrible time so the common sort of<br>points that came through from this<br>research are around the difficulties of<br>finding good treatment options overseas<br>that the quality is quite varied<br>um another bit of another key theme from<br>that research was the problems<br>encountered when you try to condense<br>treatment within a very short period of<br>time to have your treatment within a<br>holiday period so you want to have two<br>weeks and you want to have a heart<br>transplant or not quite a heart<br>transplant let's just say a new valve in<br>your heart and you want to get it done<br>in two weeks and come back to New<br>Zealand dangerous don't don't do that<br>okay<br>so condensing that time is another huge<br>challenge<br>um so there are huge ethical and<br>treatment-wise some huge issues with<br>medical tourism<br>um<br>now we've continued that work or and<br>especially with<br>um uh Professor Carl Lyons from the<br>dental school looking at Dental tourism<br>most of the research on medical tourism<br>is focused on the destination region all<br>focused on the actual patients but it<br>hasn't focused on what happens back home<br>in the in the in the generating region<br>so we undertook a nationwide survey and<br>follow-up interviews with with the<br>dentist Dental professionals throughout<br>New Zealand to look at their perceptions<br>of dental tourism<br>so what it means for them when they have<br>to potentially treat Retreat<br>patients when they come back from failed<br>treatment overseas<br>it's actually it was actually quite hard<br>I think for me to find a copyright free<br>image around dentists so that's I found<br>um yeah so you can see that I'd lived<br>quite close uh to a a rural shop that<br>had sold lots of lollies and biked past<br>that on my way home<br>um every day from the school but anyway<br>so we found I get a number of common<br>themes from this research on the survey<br>and from the interviews that one it's<br>hard to find good good dental treatment<br>overseas<br>too that that<br>um informed consent is very difficult to<br>come by and form consent the quality of<br>that is very very low three they they<br>use a whole raft of different uh I guess<br>um<br>equipment machinery in your mouth and so<br>when you come back with this this new<br>stuff in your mouth New Zealand dentists<br>don't know what to do with it basically<br>um so there were some huge problems and<br>and the<br>and the quality of the trait but varied<br>hugely uh amongst the patients that our<br>New Zealand dentists did see<br>um so that is somewhat important<br>um stuff there I think there are some<br>important messages for the dental sector<br>about advising new zealanders who<br>potentially do want to travel overseas<br>to choose your provider very very<br>carefully<br>um so basically all that sort of ethical<br>work<br>um culminated in this co-authored book<br>with with Kirsten Lovelock about the<br>ethics of Tourism and we saw this as a<br>well Robin's already spoken about this<br>as a resource mainly for students but<br>also for I guess for researchers as well<br>and just a way of opening people's eyes<br>to the whole raft of different ethical<br>issues that that come about through<br>tourism so the stuff there on sex<br>tourism and disability<br>how we addressed our relationship with<br>um okay and another an important part of<br>the book actually was<br>um how we can do good for communities<br>through tourism and<br>a lot of the research that I've done on<br>that particular sub theme has been with<br>postgraduate students with PhD students<br>in particular and this is an image<br>um of from one of my current PhD<br>students sipher Islam of a lake called<br>Boga Lake which is in um the hill tracks<br>of Bangladesh and he's working there<br>with communities in trying to develop a<br>sort of monitoring system for<br>sustainable tourism because quite often<br>these communities go into this into<br>tourism they don't really think about<br>the potential impacts on their<br>communities and on the environments that<br>those communities sort of live in of the<br>growth of Tourism so this is doing some<br>very very cool stuff there around<br>sustainable tourism indicators so I'm<br>very proud of that but I've worked with<br>some amazing PhD students and it's hard<br>to pick out you know ones which are<br>great but just some examples of really<br>good good projects where these students<br>are producing really great outcomes is<br>every folk again who did research in<br>Bangladesh on communities they're<br>looking at the roles of ngos and tourism<br>development so really challenging this<br>concept of community-based Tourism<br>development<br>um some work with lanara tuipaloa and<br>Samoa working on upper Lima Island and<br>looking at the importance of engaging<br>communities at a very very very early<br>stage to get these sort of seminal<br>decisions around what tourism is going<br>to look like in those communities<br>um Sandeep basnia and Nepal looking at<br>the Delhi for<br>uh underpaid overworked hotel workers<br>the value for them and engaging in<br>unions<br>so you know it's just a few from from<br>the many<br>but Back To Nature<br>um this is the chiring a cub group and I<br>don't know why I've got oh yes that's<br>right<br>um<br>this is coming on to the nature-based<br>tourism Stream So coming back from<br>ethics back into nature-based tourism<br>and really I remember the first time I<br>went on a tramping trip and it was it<br>was a Scout trip actually so that's Cub<br>so it's I've just blocked out those Cubs<br>there because I didn't like them very<br>much<br>um<br>but this is the first trip I went on is<br>up into the rohini ranges and it was to<br>the bed bahangina<br>um Hut which eventually became one of<br>our favorite little Huts to go into and<br>we'd go up there and we'd go shooting<br>and what have you but I just opened my<br>eyes actually for<br>what nature really was you know coming<br>from the flat lands the Badlands or the<br>Manoa 2 where you know there were just<br>macrocarpus and magpies and lots of rye<br>grass and clover and now suddenly you're<br>surrounded by this lushness and and<br>there's little bugs that want to bite<br>you the whole time just really opened my<br>eyes about a different type of Nature<br>and so I decided to expand upon this<br>theme<br>in my research and working closely with<br>um Anna who's sitting over there who's<br>our co-director of our Center for<br>recreation research we engaged the<br>number of projects looking at uh how<br>people engage with nature in national<br>parks and conservation parks around the<br>south of the South Island<br>this is one of our studies we've done on<br>tanifa conservation Parks visitor<br>studies we did a number of these for the<br>Department of Conservation<br>so just looking at what visitors do what<br>they want and how to improve their<br>experiences in nature<br>and then we were lucky enough to receive<br>funding from Sport and Recreation<br>Commission which is now sport in New<br>Zealand who are interested in exploring<br>uh why people how they can get people to<br>commit to their nature-based Recreation<br>and stop them dropping out<br>from their Recreation so again it's back<br>to this R3 recruitment retention and<br>reactivation research<br>and so this uh we undertook research<br>with participants that in-depth<br>interviews from from these these people<br>who had been nature-based key<br>nature-based participants for all their<br>lives so what was the secret what was<br>the secret for them staying committed<br>for their lives and it came down to<br>actually some of their very early<br>childhood experiences being inducted<br>into that through their friends and<br>through their whanau<br>but also being allowed to have this free<br>play<br>and I'll see Claire in the audience<br>there because he did a lot of research<br>on this clear and so this sort of aligns<br>with the work that you're doing around<br>around free play and the importance of<br>getting kids out into the outdoors and<br>nature any nature it could just be a<br>scrappy little bit of a pine tree down<br>down you know the end of the road there<br>and so people used to tell us these<br>horrendous stories about them sliding<br>down these Hills on Rusty sheets of<br>corrugated iron which would just be<br>their way out their way of getting into<br>nature you know and treating giving them<br>a little bit of resilience at the same<br>time so so that early induction and that<br>resilience they got from the early play<br>was were critical to maintaining their<br>careers<br>um and nycha<br>and then another spark funded research<br>was looking at immigrants experiences of<br>of nature-based recreation in New<br>Zealand at the time there was we used to<br>do these Nationwide when I say way spark<br>you through these Nationwide surveys of<br>recreationist recreation looking at the<br>percentages of pakiha Maori Pacifica who<br>are engaged in tramping Hunting Fishing<br>blah blah blah and not find that the<br>minority ethnicities would actually have<br>lower levels of Engagement relative to<br>sort of mainstream pakeha New Zealand<br>and so we wanted to engage with these<br>recent immigrants these new new<br>zealanders to see what they actually<br>wanted from their experiences in nature<br>and we found that well people wanted<br>different things from nature but there<br>were some commonalities Pacifica for<br>example wanted to engage with their<br>families and and with food and not in<br>any you know in-depth way out in the<br>middle of the Wilderness nature but<br>something on the periphery of nature<br>Chinese new zealanders wanted to engage<br>in nature again not in a Wilderness<br>sense but nature where they could see<br>the presence of humans in nature so<br>nature framed by Humanity I guess<br>and we've talked to some people who had<br>been had had Refugee experiences and the<br>Very thought of them going and<br>sleeping in tents or in in Hut would<br>remind them of their experience in<br>refugee camps and so that was completely<br>out of the picture for them so I guess I<br>guess the key message from this type of<br>research was a sort of prescriptive<br>approach where you would have the sort<br>of mainstream parking house saying Thou<br>shalt go out into the Wilderness and do<br>your tramping trip for seven days then<br>come back doesn't work for everyone it's<br>just like saying that every kid wants to<br>and should play rugby or something like<br>that<br>um okay I need to explain a couple of<br>things in this picture<br>and<br>someone come just grab me if I do bang<br>on too long please okay so the picture<br>this little this little beast here I've<br>got Anna to thank for that so Anna<br>bought this at a a tiger Polytechnic<br>School of Art didn't you was it a no it<br>wasn't but no<br>she bought it for me anyway<br>a little to know that would appear a few<br>years later in my professorial lecture<br>okay this was as a little artwork<br>produced by an artist called um Jared<br>Howlett and he has done a series of<br>these little strange little animals and<br>they're supposed to represent like a<br>dystopian nature<br>um<br>let me explain something else<br>exocene what is exocene<br>okay you guys have heard of the<br>anthropocene right the anthropocene is<br>an era which was dominated by human<br>Humanity human<br>okay it's the same takes it on one<br>little step further well actually that's<br>quite different really it's describing<br>an era where nature is dominated by<br>invasive species basically by not native<br>nature if you know what I mean okay so<br>we live in a world where<br>a hybrid world where almost no nature is<br>pure<br>so that's the exercise and so this<br>little Beastie here is a sort of Beast<br>that you might envisage<br>in this hybrid World hybrid between<br>nature and Technology<br>native species introduced species<br>invasive non-invasive<br>anyway<br>it was fun taking the picture<br>so what are alien invasive species not<br>not not that I don't know it's it's<br>invasive alien species is the term used<br>and invasive in Invasion ecology and so<br>we try to use it in the Marsden project<br>as much as we can so invasive alien<br>species those species who come<br>to a place that's outside of their<br>natural range they might breathe and<br>spread very very rapidly and they might<br>cause problems which are ecological<br>problems economic problems or social<br>problems so they cause harm<br>okay and and there's this great book by<br>um Jeff McNeely who's a pretty well<br>known biologist called the Great wrist<br>shuffling it's about how the world is<br>changing we're shuffling these species<br>around right as we speak there are<br>species sort of spreading here and there<br>because they're invasive species<br>and of course in New Zealand we have<br>quite a whole raft of these invasive<br>species and these were introduced uh<br>money towards the end of the 19th<br>century by our acclimately a<br>climatization societies every Province<br>had their acclimatization society and<br>they'd make a list and they'd go forth<br>into the world and they would get their<br>species and bring them into New Zealand<br>at one stage they wanted to bring Lions<br>into New Zealand and buffalo for hunting<br>purposes so these species were brought<br>here to make the place more like home<br>like old blighty<br>so you know you'd have stuff which would<br>remind you of home but also to feed and<br>clothe settlers<br>so furry animals and edible animals<br>that also species to hunt so deer<br>species<br>the problem being with invasive species<br>invasive species we're looking at the<br>social Dimensions invasive species so<br>what people think about invasive species<br>I'm not a biologist okay even though<br>I've got a forestry science degree I<br>don't pretend to be a biologist<br>um the big issue with invasive species<br>and their control from this point on is<br>around the social contract for managing<br>invasive species because they're a<br>hugely expensive to maintain I think<br>around about<br>1.7 trillion US Dollars over the last 40<br>years have been spent on actually<br>managing controlling invasive species<br>in New Zealand we spend about 1.4<br>billion dollars a year managing invasive<br>species it's a lot of money that could<br>spend on hospitals education okay<br>we need a social contract to carry on<br>spending this amount of money and<br>engaging in programs like Predator free<br>2050 like save the Kiwi like project<br>Crimson will cost money and of course we<br>are all paying for this as well<br>and I didn't even notice this until I<br>was looking at my rates it was arrived<br>just the other day and found that God<br>the rates are horrendous aren't they<br>anyway it's another topic<br>that we're all paying for wild and trees<br>control in otago which is great I don't<br>mind paying two dollars and two cents<br>I'd pay more I paid 20 I'd probably pay<br>200 now I wouldn't pay two hundred<br>dollars<br>um but we're all playing and so<br>we need this ongoing commitment so the<br>social contract for this these programs<br>to continue and that's what we're<br>researching uh through this Marston<br>project uh what people think about<br>invasive species and what values they<br>assigned to those invasive species<br>the one of the Sparks for This research<br>was something I undertook a project<br>around it took 15 years ago with a<br>research researcher called David Palmer<br>who some of you might know who passed<br>away in a tramping accident a few years<br>ago and we went down to Iraq Euro<br>Stewart Island and did some research<br>there with domestic and international<br>visitors and asked them what they<br>thought about how raft a different<br>species including some native and some<br>introduced species and we came up with<br>some quite key themes that that<br>there was an awareness amongst visitors<br>that there were these problem species<br>but there was quite a difference between<br>domestics and Internationals about the<br>types of control that we should do don't<br>mention poison don't mention 1080 don't<br>mention shooting for international<br>visitors there was virtually no support<br>for those types of control mechanisms<br>even though they recognize that these<br>species these possums and deer and other<br>nasties were hugely problematic<br>and then we asked them about this<br>vehicular control method for possums<br>which you might be aware of<br>and we heard that this is a silly little<br>question we threw in just for fun<br>basically can you still do that I'm not<br>sure if we get away with these days<br>if driving a car and saw a possible<br>sitting in the middle of the road would<br>you swear to hurt the person or miss it<br>okay so hands up those who would serve<br>to miss it<br>sometimes you just can't help can you<br>Anna<br>okay but we've found quite a difference<br>there between our New Zealand visitors<br>domestic visitors and international<br>visitors okay so there's our kiwis there<br>we go 55 would say that's fair to hit it<br>Internationals oh no we can't do that<br>that's so cute<br>okay<br>so the thing is that for these invasive<br>species communities actually get value<br>from these invasive species they might<br>get value in terms of like utilitarian<br>value but often it's sort of symbolic<br>value as well and often communities<br>actually will uh adopt these species uh<br>in their Regional tourism branding for<br>example you've got uh welcome to Gore<br>It's the world capital of brown trout<br>fishing okay with the big fish there's<br>another big fish at<br>Kaya it's probably other big fish that I<br>don't know about you've got hop into<br>waimati you get to be able to get a a<br>wallaby pie they're not sure if you<br>still can<br>welcome to Moss burn the deer capital<br>and you've got a red deer statue<br>possibly I think that might be a must be<br>and again I'm not really sure and then<br>you've got the Himalayan tar<br>statue at Lake pukaki okay so you've got<br>communities that engage with us and<br>you've got visitors traveling around the<br>country and they see these signs and<br>they see these statues and they think<br>are we supposed to be celebrating the<br>presence of deer here in aotearoa New<br>Zealand or you know this or trout or<br>what have you and if anyone read this<br>morning's ODT and you read the article<br>by Joe Bennett did you see that and he<br>raised the question about trout actually<br>about Predator free and he said well<br>trout are a predator and shouldn't we be<br>controlled in trout oh no because we<br>like to cast her out into each trout and<br>so that's why we don't count them as a<br>predator we're not going to control them<br>so it's quite arbitrary really as to<br>what becomes invasive and what gets<br>controlled and whatnot but coming back<br>to Tar<br>um here's this wonderful person the 11th<br>Duke of Bedford who was lucky enough to<br>gift us some tar back in 903 him as a<br>young man and then as a Old Gentleman<br>there he was also president of the UK<br>British Cremation Society for 20 years<br>um<br>but but anyway so there we've got<br>Himalayan tar and this is one of our<br>species that we're looking at in the<br>Marsden project so we're one of our four<br>case study species himalayantar are a<br>wonderful creature beautiful beautiful<br>creature and of course there are very<br>popular for hunting both for domestic<br>hunters and for and for introduced<br>hunters and for international Hunters<br>who pay a lot of money in fact the work<br>of the Victoria and Dr Victoria Kahu and<br>I did she's from the economics<br>Department a few years ago we estimated<br>about 12 million dollars worth of value<br>from the aerial hunting of helicopter<br>assisted hunting of of Himalayan tar but<br>they do cause damage<br>um they impact upon the sub-alpine and<br>Alpine flora and fauna they eat the<br>um Mount Cook Lily which is actually<br>about a cup so there's conflicting<br>values going on there what we have to<br>take into consideration and moving<br>forward and of course when doc uh we're<br>trying to undertake control of Himalayan<br>Tire in 2020 and they had quite a big<br>program of of helicopter hunting uh<br>planned this was legally challenged by<br>the tar Foundation they were opposed to<br>the so-called Armageddon<br>Okay so<br>there are a number of challenges to<br>invasive species and one of the big<br>challenges this thing they call<br>denialism the Mars and team will hear me<br>bang on about denialism the whole time<br>so denialism is about the really the<br>idea that a species can be invasive<br>because we accept everything in this<br>hybrid world we accept these<br>translocations that happen purposefully<br>and by accident okay so Stephen J Gould<br>is one of the proponents of this<br>denialism there's no such thing as a<br>native species and that nativism is evil<br>because it can be extended to towards<br>society as well in a rejection of people<br>who are not native to our our society to<br>our communities<br>um and this is work by Fred Pierce who<br>who writes about the value of invasive<br>species in saving the world when we've<br>got these big challenges of climate<br>change so we get some invasive species<br>will be able to cope with climate change<br>and and uh<br>it will be able to sequester carbon for<br>example so we get very quick growing<br>Wilding Pines that can sequester carbon<br>or we get<br>warmer Waters and so we get some coarse<br>introduced coarse fish can survive in<br>those polluted warm Waters so they might<br>be our savior these are all contested<br>ideas of course<br>so this whole idea of a species can it<br>be native is it is it native or is it<br>introduce a challenge by species such as<br>this you recognize this of course this<br>is the silver eye or my dad used to call<br>them the wax eye one of one of our<br>favorite little birds that they come<br>around little flocks and and do their do<br>their stuff<br>and of course there was no record on New<br>Zealand of silver eye here until 1832.<br>and so they're considered<br>um to be self-introduced and therefore<br>to be native because they've established<br>breeding colonies obviously they've been<br>breeding here for years and years and<br>years<br>um but there were records from the the<br>trans Tasman sailing ships of these<br>exhausted Little Silver Eyes landing on<br>the riggings halfway Across The Tasman<br>and then staying on the boat for the<br>rest of the voyage naturally until they<br>come to aotearoa and so were they were<br>they helped were they assisted you know<br>did they get a little bit of a free ride<br>there so can we still consider them to<br>be native I'm I'm not sure and I really<br>love that today on Maori term for silver<br>eye which is uh Touhou which means uh<br>stranger so it's a stranger which has<br>arrived or a new arrival into New<br>Zealand but there are a number of<br>stranger Birds<br>um<br>which have come about too oh sorry this<br>was<br>this whole idea of it's introduced<br>therefore it's bad<br>or it's it's native therefore it's good<br>it's challenged by this this is a<br>photograph of a pile of Kia bags<br>and of course Kia had bounties on them<br>until the 1970s and didn't actually get<br>absolute protection in New Zealand until<br>1986 and so people would actually go out<br>and Hunt these things down because they<br>would pick and get the Fate off the back<br>of the of the Sheep<br>um naughty Kia it's not such a problem<br>now because the key at range has been<br>hugely reduced due to those that are<br>hunting and those bounties<br>but of course other species that have<br>come here<br>we love and we this is um a picture of<br>Dennis Glover who wrote the famous poem<br>poem The magpies the called little idle<br>Wardle doodle Pine that some of you<br>would have learned at school okay and as<br>I said I was raised with hearing this<br>called a little Ladle Wardle doodle of<br>the magpies on the farm back in the<br>monomer too so some of these introduced<br>species haven't theyggled their way into<br>into our arts and into our hearts and<br>would be hard to imagine life without<br>them<br>right okay wasn't through<br>um<br>so it's not just those experts the<br>Stephen J Goulds and what have you that<br>have these opinions about invasive<br>species everyone has an opinion about<br>invasive species this is just a<br>collection of letters to the editor from<br>the ODT over the last few weeks about<br>some pine trees that have been removed<br>in Alexandra okay because they were<br>potentially spreading<br>and creating problems spreading through<br>the beautiful tussock land okay so for<br>every letter that was saying save the<br>trees we want to keep our retrieves as<br>another letter saying no get rid of the<br>trees so hugely important and this is<br>another one of our case studies into<br>manahuna McKenzie Basin where we're<br>going to look at how these how people<br>attribute values to to some of these<br>invasive Conifer species<br>another reason why we need to be looking<br>at this and why this Marsden research is<br>really really important is because New<br>Zealand Society is changing so<br>dramatically over over the last few<br>years<br>when I say a few years the last few<br>decades and the projections that would<br>change even more dramatically moving<br>forward<br>so we've got the whole conservation<br>conversation in New Zealand has been<br>dominated by mainstream white<br>middle-class Parky house since 1970s<br>right and through until the current time<br>and so all of our policy around invasive<br>species management has also been shaped<br>by that group within Society but with<br>the demographic change that we're seeing<br>we can't guarantee that that will still<br>be the same conversation moving forward<br>that there might be different levels of<br>commitment to different species to<br>different programs and there might be<br>actually a full offer it might be an<br>increase in commitment I'm not sure and<br>that's what we're exploring in the<br>Marsden by actually engaging with these<br>different communities with new new<br>zealanders with Pacifica with Chinese<br>new zealanders with South Asian and new<br>zealanders with young new zealanders<br>what messages are they getting moving<br>forward<br>um and did you know that actually New<br>Zealand punches are above its weight in<br>terms of our invasive species overseas<br>this is uh the Arthur dendius<br>triangulatis which is probably takes the<br>prize for the ugliest invasive species<br>this is found in the UK where it eats<br>their earthworms yes<br>and there's a big big an agricultural<br>problem I had another photograph of one<br>actually engulfing in earthworm but it<br>and this is chemistry or humble<br>chemistry oh yeah the cooker and it's a<br>problem in California we're spreading<br>through in some national parks in region<br>and state parks who would have thought<br>it are you proud of our chemistry for<br>doing that are you proud of our Arthur<br>dentist triangulatis<br>leading our reverse colonization<br>and here's a little<br>um epilobium<br>that's not an epilobium oh perhaps it<br>doesn't have beloved actually<br>brunescence which is one of the main<br>agricultural pest crops in the UK rated<br>in the top 20 of the Agricultural weeds<br>in the UK<br>because it gets into all sorts of crops<br>there<br>again reverse colonization<br>so we're coming to a very very sticky<br>point in this conversation around<br>invasives you know we want to get rid of<br>the pine trees and other conifers from<br>the hills around Queenstown but there's<br>been a portioned back from some aspects<br>in the community there about that we<br>wanted to change the vegetation around<br>our town and to remove some of those<br>beautiful colorful species when it's<br>been pushed back against that as well<br>because of course these are sort of<br>iconic views of these tourist<br>destinations<br>I mean the irony is that<br>um we rely upon 100 pure New Zealand but<br>so much of our of our promotional<br>material is not really<br>um and so much of our Landscapes is not<br>really pure perhaps we're only 32 pure<br>um in fact if this was a photograph<br>taken off the little screensaver when<br>you hop into Air New Zealand flight<br>showing that the beautiful Russell<br>lupans and Russell lupins are of course<br>a nasty bit of works<br>um that are from um from Europe<br>originally and are hugely invasive in<br>fact there was a lady<br>um<br>recording I can't remember her name but<br>she was known as the super spreader<br>of<br>conifers through the tamanahuna McKenzie<br>basin this is another Super spreader<br>this is a perch this is another one of<br>our Marsden projects one of our case<br>studies this is what we call a course<br>fish okay course fish are everything<br>that accept trout and salmon so they're<br>into things like tension rut and perch<br>and what have you at some of those<br>species and Koi carp and some of those<br>species create huge damage to the<br>waterways in terms of disturbing the<br>silt and lowering the quality of the<br>water<br>um<br>and this was another Super spreader here<br>a guy who<br>uh who would spread who was a British<br>migrant and he spread a lot of these<br>fish illegally throughout the waterways<br>especially around the waikato which is<br>the epicenter of our<br>coarse fish uh<br>industry I guess and another site of one<br>of our Marsden<br>um bits of field work the problem of<br>course when you've got these invasive<br>species<br>some of them look quite nice you know<br>here's some this is the road going up to<br>Old Rocky Mount Cook alongside uh Lake<br>pukaki and you've got a mixture of<br>different conifers there and that looks<br>like oh it could be could be somewhere<br>nice in North America it could be could<br>be Europe couldn't it well let's just<br>leave those trees there shall we<br>um because if you go to control them it<br>doesn't look quite so nice does it and<br>so you can so we're involving in this<br>conversation the tourism sector tourists<br>um to try to get their perspective on<br>how they see these species and the<br>options for management or control of<br>um and just in a little pre-study we did<br>just before the Marsden begun we did a<br>survey this was uh with uh Yun who's<br>sitting here somewhere Yun hello Yoon<br>who was a master's student at a time now<br>PhD student in the department and we did<br>a survey of<br>238 I think visitors in Tema hoona and<br>around Queenstown look at their<br>attitudes and knowledge towards wild<br>conifers and don't expect to look at all<br>that but basically those that are<br>showing you there's a low level of<br>awareness of the problems of some of<br>these species but importantly also<br>differences between those um different<br>visitor Source markets as to how they<br>understand and react to those species<br>and so we could see for example if you<br>look at the the yellow and the black<br>that's bad okay<br>so those we would show that show these<br>participants pictures of the of the<br>species and talk about and then whether<br>it would educate them and say okay did<br>you know that wild conifers caused a<br>huge problem in terms of invading<br>natural toxic lands and doing this and<br>that and the other would you still like<br>to see them and so this is the<br>percentage of people and these different<br>visitor markets who will still want to<br>see these species in their tourist<br>itineraries<br>there's Russell lupines<br>we did the same thing again Russell<br>Lupine is a Nazi because it invades the<br>braided riverbeds which are really the<br>nesting sites for rybull and band of<br>doctoral and other species there and<br>also provide cover for the Predators so<br>that's it's a huge problem and again<br>very low level of awareness amongst<br>visitors that Russell Lupine actually<br>are an ecological problem even amongst<br>New Zealand visitors and you expect new<br>zealanders to know a little bit about<br>this and again these differences between<br>these different visitor markets in terms<br>of of what they want to see done with<br>these species yes I want to see them in<br>the future or no I'd like them to be<br>controlled so this is important research<br>in terms of developing messaging for<br>those different visitor markets around<br>how we move forward<br>um I'll skip through that there's the<br>Marsden team wonderful team<br>um hopefully some of them are online now<br>because they can't be with us<br>um there's Erie Metcalf is our masters<br>researcher based in of tahi Christchurch<br>is doing research on course fish and<br>coming up with some really interesting<br>stuff<br>um the Matthias who's up up there<br>Matthias baller PRD research doing work<br>on conifers<br>Anna Anna the Conifer Anna<br>Anna who's our co-leader in the project<br>there's me and there's uh clear douse<br>that who's doing research on palaka or<br>wild pigs around the whanganui and<br>finding some really important stuff up<br>there of course pigs are a huge economic<br>Pest and they spread TB but also they<br>cause damage in Forest but there are<br>hugely valued spaces in terms of of wild<br>pork and and this food security aspect<br>but also recreational aspect for<br>communities in the whanganui so due to<br>challenging in terms of coming up with a<br>control strategy for that and what it's<br>usually valuable about Marsden project<br>is it has these sort of spring-offs as<br>well and one of the spirograph little<br>projects is some work I'm doing with Dr<br>karun rawat Who's a graduate from our<br>department looking at Himalayan tar so<br>what we're doing is we're engaging with<br>Nepalese new zealanders to see what they<br>think about the control of Himalayan<br>Tower New Zealand because of course as<br>the name suggests<br>um plantar cutting from the Himalaya and<br>are native to Syrian Nepal but over<br>there they're actually a classified as<br>an a near-threatened species and so they<br>are considered to be quite special and<br>quite important by Nepalese meanwhile in<br>New Zealand we actually go through<br>shooting these things by the thousand<br>and leaving them rotting on the hillside<br>which is sort of a lot of our<br>participants we've spoken to so far<br>don't feel that's such a good approach<br>another Offspring is with Dr Stephen<br>Parker who's sitting up there and there<br>was a another graduate from our<br>department and and we're looking with<br>invasive plants as being a potential<br>um well they're not potential they<br>already are resources for herbal<br>medicine<br>and so we're engaging with who will<br>metal herbal medalists who herbalists<br>um to see what they think about<br>um some of these species and whether<br>they should be controlled or not and and<br>how we can work together with with<br>agencies who do want to control these<br>species<br>okay so it's time to say thank you I<br>think my time has come to an end<br>and so I guess the big thank you is to<br>uh for a start to my colleagues and<br>students from the Department of Tourism<br>and as a former colleagues and students<br>as well happy a bunch of people as you<br>can see<br>um it's quite bizarre to think that I've<br>been there for gosh is it 20 22 years 23<br>years oh it was actually longer you have<br>longer contact with some of your<br>colleagues than you do with members of<br>your own family my God I mean I got rid<br>of my kids they got off when they were<br>18 years old<br>um<br>um so yeah of course you know with that<br>length of time they are family and that<br>with all the trial and trials and<br>tribulations that family does bring but<br>um<br>a wonderful bunch of of people and and<br>students and my academic colleagues<br>so uh big uh<br>for you<br>that's my mum and dad very very<br>fashionable people back in the 1950s I<br>think that photograph was taken before I<br>was even conceptualized<br>um<br>um very dashing I'm not sure that's<br>probably an invasive species my Mamas<br>are wearing there<br>hopefully it's an invasive species<br>but without them this wouldn't be<br>possible<br>and to my family<br>um strange looking bunch of people<br>um but that's that's uh those are my two<br>brothers they're my older brother who's<br>a ex Dairy Farmer from the manawatu and<br>my middle brother there who lives in<br>Scotland<br>um<br>so uh big hello to you guys<br>and to my kids<br>who are doing this<br>that's Millie and she's Millie's down<br>here uh PhD at Manchester University<br>and that's Levi and his family so Jamie<br>and Julian and and his wife Jenny and<br>they're based in Seattle<br>and that's Oscar he's over in the UK<br>my kids all wonderful<br>um<br>I guess highly talented they've all got<br>master's degrees they've worked far<br>harder at University than I ever did and<br>of course money's doing her PhD and so<br>miss you heaps and can't wait to catch<br>up and hopefully we'll be seeing Millie<br>at Christmas time all going well<br>and<br>sorry<br>we're here to do fail me<br>um but it was not only my partner<br>in life but also co-director of the<br>center for recreation research a<br>wonderful lateral thinker<br>and<br>yeah<br>so that's it from me thank you very much<br>foreign<br>um<br>well done Brent<br>um good evening everyone<br>um I'm Hazel Tucker and<br>um as a long time colleague of Brent's<br>in the tourism Department<br>uh it's my absolute prep pleasure to say<br>a few words of<br>um I'd like to start by thanking<br>everyone for for coming tonight and<br>particularly acknowledge Brent's far now<br>and a big hi to Millie Oscar and Levi<br>if you manage to get up in time I hope<br>you did<br>um yeah I think Brent and I are we're<br>really relieved shall I say delighted<br>relieved that his IPL has finally<br>managed to happen because as as was said<br>earlier though there have been many many<br>delays and<br>um it's at actually been so long since<br>his promotion that the universities on<br>its third vice Chancellor<br>um since since that time<br>um<br>as we've heard<br>um tonight from Brent that his work in<br>the area of ethics and the practice of<br>our relationships with nature is<br>particularly significant we could all<br>see that<br>um<br>and I'd like to make another big shout<br>for a big shout out for his book very<br>important book and the ethics of Tourism<br>um which has been a really really<br>important resource for um for students<br>particularly but for teachers for<br>researchers practitioners and so on and<br>I was delighted to hear from Brent<br>um recently that the Publishers have<br>asked him to do begged him I think<br>um to do a second edition an updated<br>version of the book so I think we can<br>um Beyond uh ethics and nature Brent's<br>research as we we heard tonight has<br>covered a broad spectrum of<br>tourism-related themes over the years<br>um some of which he's he's had a chance<br>to tell us about tonight some some he<br>hasn't these including and these have<br>included medical tourism which he did<br>um<br>mentioned briefly<br>um but also important topics such as<br>tourism and food security poverty<br>alleviation<br>um and then subjects such as coffee<br>um and I think when you come to think<br>about it toilets aren't quite important<br>in in the tourist experience<br>particularly public toilets<br>um<br>so yeah tonight we've um we've mostly<br>learned um about the kind of core area<br>of Brent's work which is exploration of<br>human nature relationships and how these<br>relationships or how how these<br>relationships can um should best be<br>managed<br>um and that's that's been the kind of<br>core Core theme of his research and he<br>really throws into question<br>um many received wisdoms and assumptions<br>about human nature relationships for<br>example he questions how we perceive<br>um good and bad in nature and he's<br>considered the significance of of<br>broader benefits gained from certain<br>activities such as hunting<br>um which are otherwise often contested<br>on ethical grounds<br>so just to kind of sum up really<br>um as I said Brent and I go back a long<br>way we we both started in the tourism<br>department at roughly the same time<br>around kind of the year 2000.<br>um and I can therefore personally uh<br>vouch for the fact that Brent is not<br>only a great scholar we've seen that<br>tonight he's also a fantastic teacher<br>um but kind of most of all<br>um and I think all of the people in the<br>the tourism department and across the<br>school are business and so and and the<br>university would agree with me that he's<br>an absolutely awesome colleague really<br>really awesome colleague much respected<br>and much loved<br>can find it oh yes there it is<br>I would like you to come up<br>so that I can present to you a small<br>token of appreciation from the<br>University<br>thank you very much<br>hard work</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
