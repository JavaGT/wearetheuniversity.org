Tancredi, for instance, was the fourth most popular opera performed at the Kärntnerthortheater in that period, with around 134 performances; and Rossini was the second most popular opera composer at the Kärntnerthortheater in the period, with about 778 performances of his works. <br><br>This lecture explores why, in an era, we had normally assigned to Beethoven and Schubert (perhaps also admitting Lanner and Strauss), Rossini was such a hit in Vienna, looking at how opera in the home helped with this popularity. The larger context in which the ‘Rossini rage’ took place will also be considered. What was socially and politically at stake for the Viennese opera-going public? Professor Nancy November considers ways in which the performance of opera, especially Rossini's opera, in varied arrangements in the home, contributed to empowerment and agency in a time of invasion, surveillance and stringent censorship. <br><br>Recorded on 13 September 2022.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>No transcript available</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
