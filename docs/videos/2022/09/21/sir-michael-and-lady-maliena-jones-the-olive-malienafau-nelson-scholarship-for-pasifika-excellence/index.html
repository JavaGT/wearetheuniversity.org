jones<br>i<br>was born in apia<br>and i also was raised in american samoa<br>tutuila<br>which my father comes from the villages<br>i<br>hail from are safune asau<br>and<br>leone in tutuila<br>but i was<br>raised in apia eventually moved to<br>american samoa and<br>finally<br>came to new zealand when i met this<br>handsome young man and have been here<br>for 28 years now my family still live in<br>samoa and that's always going to be home<br>for me<br>and the scholarship that<br>we're establishing the olive molyneux<br>nelson<br>pacifica scholarship is a law<br>scholarship that we would like to set up<br>in honor of my grandmother my mom's mum<br>who was<br>a graduate from<br>auckland university<br>in law<br>talofa lover<br>my name is michael jones and uh<br>born here in new zealand out in west<br>auckland and i'm sam 1 and my villages<br>and also<br>connected to sapa pali in surveying so<br>i'm very proud to be a kiwi someone and<br>very grateful to<br>you know be part of<br>this wider community i'm just privileged<br>to have been with malina's able to set<br>up a foundation that we can now just do<br>this sort of mahi and we're very very<br>grateful<br>we have<br>we've been married 28 years as marlena<br>said and we do a lot of our work<br>together in the community and we love<br>doing that together<br>we have three children tiara mainna<br>she's 23 she's a auckland university<br>student studying medicine and<br>my son nicole he's 22 and he's also<br>studying<br>business<br>commerce and then a 12 year old levi<br>just very<br>grateful again to just be in a position<br>where we can partner with the university<br>of auckland and also the<br>the law school um<br>faculty here at um this wonderful<br>university institution and and i'm<br>also an<br>alumni of this<br>of auckland university so that's really<br>cool michael and i established<br>a foundation in his name and just wanted<br>to do something maybe a bit different<br>from the work that we've been doing<br>because we've been involved in<br>working with our pacific communities for<br>years and<br>i've been working with<br>youth mentoring<br>supporting our pacifica families and<br>also<br>michael and i've helped a lot in<br>establishing a school for pacifica<br>students<br>but um this is a new opportunity for us<br>to<br>maybe just do things a little bit um<br>we've worked together but<br>just the vision this foundation brings<br>is allowing us to just do things<br>a little bit different from what we've<br>been able to do before<br>and<br>i have a<br>strong belief in education<br>just something that's been ingrained<br>in me and then i suppose my children and<br>michael that<br>for us as pasvica<br>a young girl from samoa trying to make<br>your way in the big world<br>and<br>and just be able to i've always learned<br>that education is just sort of part of<br>like a passport that allows you to<br>have those opportunities but that also<br>comes from those who have gone before us<br>so<br>this scholarship is actually in honor of<br>my<br>grandmother my mom's maliena fal<br>olive maliana faun nelson<br>i never got to meet her<br>but knowing who she was<br>i was always inspired by her<br>i've always known not just from her but<br>from just we've come from along on both<br>sides of our family<br>so many people that have gone before us<br>who have contributed<br>to<br>enhancing our<br>our people in in so many different ways<br>and this is just<br>an opportunity to<br>do exactly what they've done for us in<br>our own way so<br>by establishing<br>a<br>scholarship in honor of my grandmother<br>i feel like<br>it connects me to her<br>but it also allows me to carry on just<br>that legacy that was passed down through<br>my mother and to me and to my children<br>and so<br>auckland university gave us a wonderful<br>opportunity to do something beyond<br>ourselves<br>this will be established for<br>many generations to come and hopefully<br>inspires<br>others<br>to do the same because we are blessed<br>people our pacifica people yeah the<br>significance of the<br>olive male nfl<br>nelson scholarship is that<br>you know for us it's<br>a legacy it's celebrating an amazing<br>pioneering pacifica<br>woman matriarch<br>you know she's<br>as melinda said she's inspirational to<br>all of us and particularly for pacifico<br>woman i believe you know as<br>her story is one of<br>leaving samoa in the early i don't know<br>you know<br>19th century<br>sort of<br>forged<br>something that had never been done<br>before so she broke a ceiling around<br>being the first pacifica<br>uh<br>woman female graduate um<br>and in law<br>she i suppose<br>was the first of many other things too<br>you know just because of<br>her i suppose courage<br>and her<br>i suppose passion to<br>just become<br>a lawyer<br>and<br>to serve her people and then she<br>graduated from the law faculty here at<br>oakland university<br>and went back to samoa served her people<br>was part of writing up and i suppose<br>drafting the very first<br>constitution of the independent state of<br>samoa in 1962<br>so you know those are all really<br>inspirational and powerful<br>accomplishments of this amazing woman<br>who just happens to be you know<br>my wife's grandmother and it's quite<br>special she has the same name<br>so there's all these wonderful<br>synergies and and the sense of<br>connection to this and then of course um<br>also for me i suppose being a alumni of<br>the university of auckland myself and<br>having studied here and did all my<br>education here my my university<br>education i have a very strong<br>connection here too so in every way it<br>just<br>ticked all the boxes and it felt really<br>right i'm i'm the recipient of a<br>scholarship that allowed me to study<br>here at oakland university when i was 18<br>fresh out of a school out in west<br>auckland and it was designed for<br>polynesian leadership and i'm so<br>grateful for that you know it really<br>helped me to get through those first<br>formative years they were tough but you<br>know that scholarship was awesome<br>and so you know we just have a heart to<br>see the proliferation of more<br>scholarships we'd like to see this as<br>you know how do we build more<br>you know i suppose resources around<br>supporting pacifica law students in<br>particular but could be right across the<br>university and to see more olive<br>malienophile nelson's graduate and do<br>great things and<br>make an impact and you know contribute<br>to society not just here but back in the<br>pacific too we're very big on that and<br>so our heart is to see<br>this scholarship<br>really transform and power enable young<br>pacifica<br>men and women our students<br>to really you know make a fistful of<br>their time here we know how hard it is<br>to get through study you know to<br>pacifica retention pacific success you<br>know that's paramount and we believe in<br>that we're very passionate about that so<br>we hope that this scholarship will<br>continue to<br>build a new generation of great<br>uh<br>pacific leaders so we've got a real<br>heart for service<br>leadership culture um as part of that so<br>it's all woven in it's a bit like the<br>lalanga of the weaving in this fale it's<br>all meshed in and it's woven in and<br>there's layers<br>ultimately it's a beautiful thing and<br>and we can see real beauty coming out of<br>it i'm really inspired by the young<br>people that i caught we meet at all<br>different levels<br>um i find that they are very genuine in<br>their culture and for some that have<br>actually never grown up in the islands<br>they've just<br>taken in everything that<br>they see around them whether it's from<br>their parents or their grandparents and<br>have sort of<br>created<br>what's meaningful for them in the<br>context of living in new zealand and i<br>find<br>that there's a lot of innovative young<br>people with brilliant ideas and<br>are well spoken<br>they present their culture in such a<br>beautiful way<br>and so i find it it never ceases to<br>amaze me when i keep meeting<br>really young inspiring young people that<br>use their voice for good but a lot of<br>them use their hands and feet to serve<br>others and you know i just think<br>i see it around me all the time and it<br>just inspires me<br>watching them and it just makes me<br>really proud that<br>from all<br>different pacifica nations<br>are just<br>such amazing um like lighthouses in<br>in our city and um they really shine so<br>yeah<br>i agree i mean we<br>willian and i and what inspires and<br>motivates us to do what we do every day<br>whether it's you know<br>working with you for families or<br>food banks you know that's something<br>that's become quite a big part of our<br>mahi<br>just because of the need out there but<br>it's it's seeing um our<br>tupulanga rangatahi the next generation<br>um shine and it's fulfilling their full<br>potential realizing<br>you know we see so much potential in our<br>our<br>our young people it just blows our mind<br>but the tragedy is that we see a lot of<br>that robbed you know their journey to<br>being the best has aborted or it's<br>that's undermined because of things<br>around them circumstances so you know<br>our heart has always been how do we put<br>scaffolding or put programs or<br>initiatives that can see them be the<br>very best that they can be<br>education is a key to that you know we<br>just want them to have<br>full lives where they<br>you know can<br>enjoy<br>you know<br>life and all its abundance but you know<br>but then contribute to to their streets<br>neighborhoods homes communities<br>whatever they are they serve and i think<br>my take would be more like from from<br>being a mum you know i've got a 23 year<br>old and a 22 year old so they've already<br>probably been through that stage in life<br>and<br>i've always said to them they don't have<br>to be the smartest they just have to<br>really<br>apply themselves and so you'll you hear<br>you 100 won't succeed if you don't try<br>you know if you don't put your name in<br>100 you won't<br>be um considered<br>but um you know there's nothing<br>that's too hard<br>and i think if someone's got a burning<br>desire to give it a go please give it a<br>go whoever becomes successful on the<br>other end<br>like we don't just want to provide<br>financially but we want to be able to<br>encourage that young person and and walk<br>this journey with them<br>and<br>get people around them to make it<br>possible so i know that we all think<br>that we're not capable of it but we<br>don't know until we try you never you<br>don't have to be the smartest person<br>but you just have to have a<br>passion and a desire to just see<br>a seed in your life come to fruition and<br>so you know and melina made reference to<br>her father tacey<br>olive nelson who was a you know one of<br>the champions of the independence<br>movement just one of them but he did<br>play a pretty significant role and<br>you know he was a patriot um and so was<br>marlena phil's grandmother ollie she was<br>a patriot<br>and she was so proud of<br>um who they were and they were so strong<br>in their identity and they knew what<br>they wanted to do which was<br>they wanted to be the masters of their<br>own destiny you know some more more so<br>more<br>we don't need<br>anyone telling us how to govern<br>or do our politics or our culture<br>and i think again that's<br>that's sort of the dna<br>of this scholarship and you know you<br>talk about the inspiration for pacifica<br>young woman in particular<br>that's the dna and the dna of<br>our tina of our mother of our<br>grandmother and it sort of comes through</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
