However, the changing perspectives of State members together with the legal effect of the Declaration contribute to these challenges.<br><br>Staying within the international arena, selected case studies from two fora, the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the United Nations Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, illustrate the tensions that exist between State members and Indigenous Peoples.<br><br>Despite the raft of challenges, Indigenous peoples remain resilient.<br><br>About Professor Valmaine Toki:<br>Professor Valmaine Toki is of Ngati Rehua, Ngatiwai, Ngapuhi descent.

privilege to deliver my<br>professorial lecture this evening i<br>would firstly like to thank our vice<br>chancellor professor neil quigley for<br>this generous introduction<br>acknowledge emeritus<br>margaret wilson for her wisdom and<br>guidance<br>professor alison kirkman for her belief<br>professor alpena roy<br>my depending a whanau<br>my iwi maori whanau here at the<br>university for their support and of<br>course my whanau steve kitty tamara and<br>tomata and of course<br>our pp mahina<br>my professor lecture tonight speaks to<br>the challenges that indigenous peoples<br>face<br>which is quite serendipitous given that<br>last week on august 9 we celebrated<br>indigenous peoples day as we do every<br>year and this year the theme was on the<br>role of indigenous women in the<br>preservation and transmission of<br>traditional knowledge<br>by way of introduction indigenous<br>peoples comprise about six percent of<br>global population some 476 million<br>people across 90 countries located in<br>every region<br>they include the poorest of the poor the<br>most marginalized and account for 19 of<br>the extreme poor<br>although often<br>the oldest inhabitants of nations are<br>frequently stripped of their rights<br>particularly that fundamental right of<br>self-determination or tinaranga<br>teratanga and of course rights to land<br>and rights to fenua resulting in<br>consequences for their well-being and<br>the health of their communities<br>despite data collected on indigenous<br>peoples globally the definition of<br>indigenous remains quite contentious<br>particularly in africa and<br>asia<br>so<br>for example to be indigenous do you have<br>to be a minority sometimes but not<br>always is it necessary to have that<br>unique connection to land<br>usually<br>are you required to be subject to<br>colonization usually that is the case<br>to be indigenous<br>is often a combination of various<br>criteria in the absence of a culturally<br>universally accepted definition of<br>varying definitions have emerged such as<br>the one on screen by xiao zhang<br>he's under secretary general for the<br>jose martinez kobo the special<br>repertoire on the sub-commission on<br>prevention of discrimination and<br>protection of minorities set out one of<br>the most cited definitions of the term<br>indigenous in a seminal study of the<br>problem of discrimination against<br>indigenous populations<br>on screen recognises key criteria such<br>as an historical continuity that<br>indigenous peoples often form that<br>non-non-dominant sector of communities<br>and yet determined to transmit and also<br>preserve their identity according to<br>their own their own systems<br>and further defining that historical<br>continuity component we find that an<br>indigenous person is one<br>who belongs to an indigenous community<br>through self-identification<br>as indigenous so we're talking about<br>group consciousness and is recognized<br>and accepted by the community as one of<br>its members so<br>acceptance by the group<br>jose martinez kobo provided the<br>intellectual framework through which<br>notions of indigeneity should be<br>understood centering this is important<br>centering the rights of indigenous<br>peoples themselves<br>to define who is indigenous<br>so what this does is that it preserves<br>for indigenous peoples that sovereign<br>right and power to decide who belongs to<br>them without that an external<br>interference often by the state<br>despite this often cited definition<br>we are seeing more and more minority and<br>community groups seeking to claim rights<br>through that indigenous rubric and<br>indeed during the last session of the<br>expect mechanism held in the u.n in<br>geneva we had local community groups<br>providing interventions to that effect<br>although un agencies such as the world<br>bank defer to indigenous peoples and<br>local communities as a<br>discrete classification of peoples they<br>recognize this implied conflation of<br>indigenous peoples in local communities<br>often referred to as spillage is<br>problematic<br>subsequently the three u.n entities<br>mandated within the area of indigenous<br>rights so the special rapporteur on the<br>rights of indigenous peoples the unit<br>united nations<br>permanent forum on indigenous surgeries<br>and the expert mechanism on the rights<br>of indigenous peoples will be holding<br>expert seminars this year the first is<br>at the university of arizona and that's<br>to examine and discuss the continuing<br>development of or slippage is a term<br>that they use between minority rights<br>community rights and the rights of<br>indigenous peoples<br>now perhaps if the un declaration on the<br>rights of indigenous peoples had<br>provided a definition of indigenous we<br>may or may not be in this position<br>however during the period leading up to<br>the formulation of the declaration<br>the indigenous organizations developed a<br>common position and actually rejected<br>the idea of a formal definition of<br>indigenous peoples that would be adopted<br>by the states similarly on the other<br>side the governmental<br>delegations expressed the view that it<br>was neither desirable nor necessary to<br>elaborate a universal definition of<br>indigenous peoples<br>and at its 15th session in 1997 the<br>working group concluded that a<br>definition of indigenous peoples at that<br>global level was not possible at that<br>time and certainly certainly not<br>necessary for the eventual adoption of<br>the united nations declaration on the<br>rights of indigenous peoples<br>this leads us nicely on to the<br>declaration<br>as mentioned the declaration was the<br>initiative of the working group the<br>working group on indigenous populations<br>this group was established in 1982 with<br>the mandate to develop international<br>standards concerning indigenous people's<br>rights<br>the declaration was a clear<br>manifestation of this mandate and an<br>articulation of international standards<br>on the rights of indigenous peoples<br>but it was not until some 25 years later<br>in september 2007 that the final text<br>was attacked adopted sorry by the<br>general assembly with the majority of<br>144 states in favor there are 11<br>abstentions at the time and the four<br>states we all know<br>actually oppose adoption so<br>australia canada united states and us<br>here in altar on new zealand<br>to further unpack the relevance of the<br>declaration i think it's necessary to<br>understand why these four states voted<br>against the declaration and then then<br>eventually changed their position<br>australia australia was the first to<br>reverse its position and officially<br>endorsed a declaration on the 3rd of<br>april 2009 so about the same time as a<br>rud apology<br>official endorsement requires a clear<br>unequivocal statement which briefly<br>takes place on the floor of the general<br>assembly<br>applying the standard questions and<br>nature of australia's endorsement and<br>why why because the statement made by<br>jenny macklin was not delivered in the<br>general assembly but in parliament house<br>and additionally it was not delivered on<br>the floor of the house of<br>parliament so correspondingly there's no<br>recognition in hansard<br>a closer examination of the wording of<br>his statement reveals ambivalence so<br>rather than announce that australia<br>endorsed as a declaration mackler noted<br>that australia changes its position and<br>gives it support for the declaration<br>for academics including rothwell<br>these features of australia's<br>endorsement cast serious doubts of<br>whether any legal effect will arise<br>so<br>it's unsubsequently it's unsurprising<br>that academics assert that in light of<br>of these facts the high court of<br>australia<br>would not hold the statement as legally<br>binding<br>following australia's announcement of<br>support we<br>followed up on the 20th of april 2010<br>approximately a year later with minister<br>sharples from the general assembly in<br>new york during the ninth session of the<br>united nations permanent forum on<br>indigenous issues and the then<br>honourable minister simon power from<br>parliament in wellington<br>announced that new zealand would be<br>reversing its position and officially<br>endorsing the declaration<br>unlike australia this announcement was<br>made in the general assembly and in new<br>zealand's parliament and subsequently<br>noted in hansard however the wording the<br>wording of the endorsement is parallel<br>to jenny macklin's statement<br>in his address to the united nations<br>permanent forum minister sharple stated<br>today today new zealand changes its<br>position and we are pleased to express<br>our support for the declaration<br>so like australia we do not stay we<br>reverse our position nor that we endorse<br>a declaration so what this does it<br>raises questions on the intention of the<br>statement and the nature of the<br>endorsement<br>minister staples then identified a<br>couple of areas two areas where new<br>zealand held reservations first of all<br>article 26 the rights to lands<br>territories and resources and article 9<br>the right of free prion informed consent<br>however it's unclear whether states can<br>place reservations or caveats<br>on their endorsements supporting some<br>articles but reversing or reserving<br>support on others<br>it was the opinion of the government<br>that these provisions were fundamentally<br>incompatible with first<br>our constitutional legal arrangements<br>here in altera new zealand secondly the<br>treaty of waitangi and thirdly the<br>governing the principle of governing for<br>the good for the good of all our<br>citizens however however unlike<br>ratifying an international treaty or<br>covenant it's unclear whether the<br>selective endorsement is acceptable<br>reservations to human rights treaties<br>are contentious<br>particularly with the extent of that<br>reservation undermines the goals of the<br>treaty<br>to selectively endorse an aspirational<br>human rights declaration contradicts the<br>principles of indivisibility and<br>interdependence of all human rights<br>this selective endorsement would appear<br>to be the antithesis right of what<br>a morally aspirational document such as<br>a declaration seeks to achieve<br>despite<br>despite concerns over what constitutes<br>an official endorsement the issue<br>concerning the effect and role of the<br>reservation or caveat new zealand placed<br>on the declaration is far more<br>problematic<br>in his announcement to the united<br>nations permanent forum minister sharp<br>was qualified new zealand's endorsement<br>i mean i've got what he says on screen<br>there<br>so this reservation or caveat provides<br>that new zealand's legal and<br>constitutional frameworks will do what<br>will define the bounds of new zealand's<br>engagement with the declaration<br>however we know when we look at the text<br>of the declaration we think about<br>article 46 1 it's quite clear because it<br>provides that nothing nothing in this<br>declaration may be interpreted as<br>authorizing or encouraging any action<br>which would dismember or impair totally<br>or in part the territorial integrity or<br>political unity of sovereign and<br>independent states<br>however with that being said earlier<br>this year minister jackson the minister<br>for maori development<br>who is progressing a declaration plan<br>has completed the first stage he<br>recently stated that<br>there is a lot of mahi a cross<br>government underway that's consistent<br>with the declaration but having a plan<br>having a plan sets a road map a robot of<br>actions to steadily work towards and<br>measure progress against<br>so circling back to what minister<br>sharple said in the permanent forum is<br>this the government controlling and<br>defining the bounds of new zealand's<br>engagement with the aspirational<br>not to be left behind<br>on the 12th of november 2010 the<br>canadian government announced its<br>support for the declaration<br>and one month later on 16th of december<br>2010 the united states also lent support<br>for the declaration<br>the terminology they employed does not<br>include the term endorsement but instead<br>that of statements endorsements of<br>course bring the stronger stronger<br>language<br>both refer to the declaration as being<br>not legally binding and not not a<br>statement of current international law<br>or similarly<br>that it does not reflect customary<br>international law nor indeed change<br>the canadian laws<br>both refer to the aspirational nature of<br>the declaration the language of the<br>statements employs terms such as<br>reaffirming or continuing the state's<br>commitment to indigenous peoples<br>similar to new zealand and australia the<br>support of the declaration comes with<br>reservations and caveats on screen<br>and so on on this analysis of support<br>of the declaration elicited by these<br>four countries<br>it's problematic because it compromises<br>the rights contained within the<br>declaration those fundamental rights<br>nevertheless perceived as a major<br>triumph the declaration is the only<br>international instrument that views<br>indigenous rights through an indigenous<br>lens and amalgamates indigenous<br>international rights within within one<br>document<br>prior to the declaration indigenous<br>peoples had to<br>creatively use existing international<br>covenants and conventions such as the<br>international covenant on civil and<br>political rights and i'm thinking about<br>article 27 the right to culture there<br>and of course the mahuika fishing case<br>is<br>the one that we recognize most there<br>turning uh to consider the legal effect<br>of the declaration<br>the declaration continues to have legal<br>effect in different jurisdictions<br>and what this does is highlights the<br>importance of the role of politics and<br>cause into question the legal<br>effectiveness of the declaration<br>the orthodox view is that the<br>declaration is soft law and will not be<br>binding upon the states unless it's<br>incorporated into domestic legislation<br>the doctrine of state sovereignty<br>provides a restriction a restriction on<br>international instruments such as the<br>declaration and that's to regulate the<br>matters within the realm of of the state<br>incorporation of the declaration into<br>state law is the most effective and this<br>has occurred in various jurisdictions<br>including most of our latin american<br>jurisdictions and congo brazil where the<br>recognition of indigenous rights<br>are included within their respective<br>constitutions<br>in canada we have bill c15 which<br>received royal assent last year and on<br>june 21st<br>which indicates canada's positive steps<br>to incorporating indigenous rights and<br>here in ultra new zealand as mentioned<br>we have a declaration plan<br>although a little slow and not actually<br>incorporated in any piece of legislation<br>in the absence of this direct<br>incorporation by statute there are<br>different methods of recognizing<br>international human rights instruments<br>including recourse through<br>administrative law principles<br>first we have<br>mandatory relevant consideration in new<br>zealand has been employed to treat<br>unincorporated international obligations<br>as considerations for this decision<br>maker<br>however in this instance it would<br>necessitate extending that approach<br>right from an unincorporated<br>international obligation such as a<br>treaty to an international moral<br>obligation such as a declaration<br>notwithstanding that the hua kina<br>development trust case noted that<br>international obligations include both<br>conventions and declarations such as<br>that united nations declaration on the<br>rights of indigenous peoples and given<br>the robust nature of the debate and<br>finalization of the declaration which<br>took 25 years<br>together with the overwhelming majority<br>of states who endorsed the declaration<br>144<br>these matters collectively bode well<br>however their factors these factors are<br>only persuasive only persuasive on the<br>courts and not binding<br>another equally valid point is whether<br>or not the use of a mandatory relevant<br>consideration is simply a backdooring a<br>backdooring approach to incorporate the<br>declaration and it should be the purview<br>of the legislature not the judiciary to<br>incorporate international<br>obligations such as these<br>also we have the presumption of of<br>consistency what's this it's a common<br>law principle of statutory<br>interpretation that recognizes that<br>parliament is presumed not to legislate<br>intentionally in breach of its<br>obligations<br>but as new zealand's now offered support<br>for the declaration this presumption may<br>apply however like any presumption it<br>can be rebutted by the clear wording of<br>a statute<br>when we think about a customary<br>international law<br>uh declarations can apply<br>can acquire a normative character and<br>pursuant to article 38 j of the icj<br>statute become customary international<br>law and binding on states and we know<br>that customer international law form is<br>part of our common law<br>however the test for finding customary<br>international law must be met and that's<br>of state practice and opinions or what<br>states think<br>so the state's action must be<br>intentional and then intention must<br>manifest in action<br>if we find that new zealand's action of<br>endorsing the declaration satisfies that<br>first limb and follow case law to relax<br>relax its second limb of state intention<br>then perhaps this is promising<br>according to professor gemini<br>the declaration may be understood to<br>embody or reflect to some extent<br>customary international law<br>a norm of customer international law<br>emerges or crystallizes when a<br>preponderance of states converge on a<br>common understanding of the norm's<br>content and expect future behaviour to<br>conform to conform to that norm<br>however<br>even if this was accepted new zealand<br>could rely on the initial vote<br>against the declaration and claimed that<br>persistent objector status and thus<br>immune from customary international law<br>turning to a look at case law<br>the tribunal the waitangi tribunal<br>recently reviewed the declaration as<br>relevant<br>relevant to the manner in which the<br>principles of the treaty should be<br>observed by court by crown officials<br>the approach to the declaration and why<br>2417 report was to use the declaration<br>as a tool where possible why why to<br>understand the crown's obligation in<br>specific circumstances to assist their<br>assessment of the crown's actions<br>against principles of the treaty<br>in addition our supreme court bench is<br>also also referring to the declaration<br>so we think about the takamori case and<br>the wakatsu case albeit obita but<br>nonetheless cited<br>and i always encourage my students to<br>argue the declaration and submissions<br>i say it may not be the strongest ground<br>but an additional layer to their<br>submission to hopefully work towards<br>so although<br>the orthodoxy of the declaration is that<br>it's not binding we have a wealth of<br>creative tools alongside that changing<br>approach from our branch<br>and this in and of itself is a promising<br>development when considering the legal<br>effect of the declaration<br>remembering of course the declaration<br>doesn't create any new rights but it's<br>the only international instrument that<br>views indigenous rights through an<br>indigenous lens<br>the declaration simply affirms rights<br>derived from human rights principles<br>such as equality right such as<br>self-determination<br>the declaration seeks to recognize<br>indigenous people's rights and<br>contextualize those and<br>rights in light of particular<br>characteristics and circumstances and<br>promotes measures to remedy the right's<br>historical systemic violation<br>the significance of the declaration lies<br>it lies in its effect<br>it provides a benchmark as an<br>international standard against which<br>indigenous peoples may measure state<br>action against<br>state breach of the standard provides<br>indigenous peoples with a means of<br>appeal within that international arena<br>recognized and supported by<br>u.n member states this declaration<br>contains norms that are already binding<br>in international law<br>so the declaration provides us<br>additional international instrument for<br>indigenous peoples when their rights<br>such as the right to participate fully<br>in decision making has been breached<br>indigenous peoples can now argue that<br>not only have international treaties<br>been broken but a breach of the right<br>and the declaration has occurred<br>the available remedy what's the remedy i<br>think is a little bit uncertain<br>nonetheless it would be reasonable<br>reasonable to conclude that this would<br>provide an avenue to engender effective<br>dialogue between the state and<br>indigenous peoples<br>and to further explore this<br>this possibility this possible<br>relationship i wanted to<br>quickly<br>turn to<br>consider how u.n vehicles can assist the<br>recognition of indigenous rights with a<br>couple of examples or case studies<br>first<br>during my time on the permanent forum i<br>met with the pacific caucus to hear<br>their concerns<br>the commonly held issue was that of<br>self-determination right the key<br>write article 3 right within the<br>declaration<br>so i append a study on decolonization of<br>the pacific with an extract on the<br>screen<br>remembering of course there is a<br>decolonization process within the un<br>where a committee<br>considers applications from entities<br>inscribed on the non-self-governing<br>territories list for a decolonization uh<br>process to take place<br>and indeed during the last session of<br>the expert mechanism there is a lot of<br>lobbying to the mechanism to have this<br>component of the un process are realized<br>through a proposal to the human rights<br>council<br>new zealand recently agreed to enter<br>into a decolonization process with<br>tukola who is on the list of<br>non-self-governing territories and<br>during the last decolonization session<br>in geneva last month new zealand noted<br>that<br>it is undisputed that colonization has<br>been detrimental to pacific island<br>nations that indigenous peoples have a<br>right to self-determination<br>and that decolonization of the pacific<br>is problematic<br>the third international decade for the<br>eradication of colonialism<br>notwithstanding<br>the remain pacific islands<br>seeking independence from their<br>colonisers<br>i'm hopeful that there'll be more<br>progress in that space but as i<br>mentioned that intervention only<br>occurred last month from<br>from the new zealand mission in geneva<br>so my my study that i append i included<br>was papua hawaii and french polynesia<br>and as you can imagine this wasn't<br>popular with some of the state members<br>and they actually sought to hold up the<br>report through through the un process<br>in this instance i was fortunate to have<br>the support from the nz admission in new<br>york<br>who with the addition additional support<br>of friendly states managed to avert a<br>virta veto through the un economic and<br>social council and thankfully the report<br>regressed it and was tabled<br>otherwise<br>my colleagues on the forum would have<br>been really cranky with me<br>uh the second the second case study um<br>is for my recent um expert mechanism<br>session in geneva uh the statements are<br>self self-explanatory and speak to an<br>unacceptable behaviour by a state<br>representative to an indigenous woman<br>actually from serbia<br>and she's seeking asylum in denmark due<br>to the troubles<br>from between the ukraine and russia war<br>so she's got asylum in denmark<br>denmark<br>this the first statement um or<br>intervention<br>from the floor of the expert mechanism<br>continues to state that<br>aggressive dialogue of the<br>representative of the russian state was<br>mrs yana tanaka shiva<br>including an attempt to find out her<br>personal data as a pure fact of<br>intimidation of indigenous rights<br>defenders<br>considering our long negative practice<br>in that field with russian officials<br>again<br>in a similar fashion<br>friendly states collectively made a<br>statement<br>responding to to this behaviour which<br>which happened<br>more than once during the session<br>and i've i've got the collective<br>statement made on screen so<br>this is condemning the intimidation<br>against indigenous peoples as occurred<br>with representative from the russian<br>federation<br>noting that everyone should have<br>unhindered access with international<br>bodies without fear<br>fear of reprisal<br>reaffirming the role of the expect<br>mechanism to provide advice to the human<br>rights council and to assist states to<br>achieve the ends of the declaration<br>so both both of those examples speak to<br>the importance of state and indigenous<br>peoples people's engagement and if i<br>could just maybe go off script here a<br>little bit and just mentioned something<br>else that happened<br>along the same lines during the session<br>is that we were going to the expert<br>mechanism was going to dialogue with<br>with the russian federation and we<br>invited them to<br>dialogue with us<br>they came back and they said they would<br>speak to us but only in their mission<br>across the road from the u.n and those<br>of you who have been to the union<br>engineer will know what i'm talking<br>about<br>and the um<br>their mission has got like razor wire on<br>the top and they have a guard outside<br>with a with a gun there and so we said<br>no thank you thank you but no thank you<br>because we were<br>just being a little bit mindful that um<br>perhaps if we went in there it might<br>been a little bit difficult<br>to continue uh finishing the session so<br>but we did try to<br>meet with the russian delegation to try<br>and sort of explain to them that we<br>didn't consider that behavior as being<br>acceptable and appropriate in that<br>instance<br>uh before before i conclude um just as<br>an example of how un processes assist<br>indigenous peoples<br>one of my colleagues on the expect<br>mechanism and exit cunningham she was<br>actually prevented from boarding her<br>confirmed flight to return home to<br>nicaragua<br>following her participation in the 15th<br>session of the expert mechanism<br>the airline had received an email from<br>the government of nicaragua stipulating<br>that her entry into the nicaraguan<br>territory would be refused<br>this has resulted in an escalation as<br>you would imagine to the president of<br>the human rights council<br>who has engaged in dialogue to enable<br>alexa to return home<br>i think<br>we'll be getting an update tomorrow but<br>as far as i am aware she's actually<br>still still in geneva<br>and also the pressing issue of course is<br>whether her safety can be guaranteed<br>so during this a very short chat<br>i've endeavoured to take you for a walk<br>or perhaps a sprint at times<br>on a path to recognise indigenous rights<br>and and highlight the myriad of<br>challenges that exist from first<br>minority groups and community groups<br>seeking to claim under the rubric of<br>indigenous rights to secondly when an<br>international instrument such as a<br>declaration is finally adopted after 25<br>years of drafting there are still states<br>who offer reservations to watch to what<br>is an aspirationally non-binding human<br>rights instrument to thirdly as a<br>declaration the orthodox view is that<br>it's non-binding unless incorporated<br>into the constitution but we know there<br>are creative tools to ensure these<br>fundamental<br>rights are recognized and i'm looking at<br>our law students here or our students in<br>general when i'm saying that<br>and and fourth the un system itself<br>and the vehicles mandated specifically<br>within the area of indigenous rights and<br>how political uh platforms can seek to<br>support but also undermine undermine<br>indigenous voices<br>nonetheless despite these challenges<br>indigenous peoples are resilient<br>indigenous peoples are survivors<br>and and recalling recalling of course<br>that we do not necessarily need an<br>instrument to tell us that our right of<br>self-determination that our right of<br>tenant<br>exists<br>or our right to our culture exists these<br>rights exist irrespectively of whether<br>they're captured in an international<br>um as a lawyer we know that it's helpful<br>if it is but<br>i always say to my students these rights<br>exist irrespectively they don't need to<br>be captured into a document we know<br>ourselves we exercise tinoranga<br>tiratanga at our home and our schools<br>and our churches and our community<br>so we don't need an instrument to tell<br>us are that right that right exists<br>kyoto<br>thank you all very much for attending<br>this evening for those of you who don't<br>know me my name is professor alpena roy<br>dean of teparinga faculty of law<br>it gives
