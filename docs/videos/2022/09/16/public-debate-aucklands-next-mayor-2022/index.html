election faced scrutiny at a debate hosted by Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland, and Newsroom.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>have you though reached out far enough<br>to those who are perhaps least aware<br>least motivated to get involved and to<br>vote what astounds me is how little<br>interest there is in voting and local<br>government elections and yet it is so<br>fundamentally important to people's<br>day-to-day lives quarter of our<br>population now uh what we broadly call<br>Asian Chinese and Indian being the<br>largest two groups of those and I've<br>gone out of a way to be involved with<br>that group because they're great people<br>to talk to they're quite transactional<br>you know they're really only interested<br>in whether you're they really want a<br>businessman in charge they're not too<br>fussed about policies they're quite<br>simple I like them the social media has<br>been fantastic over the last three years<br>because the feedback I'm getting is<br>people saying I've never bothered voting<br>before I'm going to this time if you<br>look at the voting data it matches the<br>very data of this University that I used<br>to work for if you own a house you tend<br>to vote and if you don't own a house you<br>tend not to vote no different for this<br>University if you're from a low decile<br>School you won't come to this University<br>because I worked here for 15 years and<br>if you come from a wealthy school you're<br>going to come to this University can you<br>name your three top climate actions I've<br>talked about phase three we're getting<br>people out of their cars onto walking<br>and and cycling so fast free is going to<br>address that yep so I've also called for<br>a mayor's Coalition on how we're going<br>to Advocate to the crown to make sure we<br>get money back from the GST we pay on<br>rates to go towards climate action and<br>urban our head and I know that's already<br>in<br>but we've got to ensure that we're<br>planting we've got more canopy cover<br>because we know that in poorer areas of<br>the city there's canopy covers only<br>eight percent and we want to get it<br>right up to 30 so it's General across<br>the city three top climate actions that<br>no make a difference no none nope you<br>know my stance on climate and everybody<br>or who's watching on and a few there<br>here won't so let me explain to it I<br>disagree with the numbers that have been<br>presented for the plan by Auckland<br>Council I do not think that those<br>numbers are what we should be concerned<br>about the first thing I do is uh shift<br>all the containers from The Wharf on<br>trains rather than trucks it gets rid of<br>the trucks out of the city<br>and 150 containers on a train only uses<br>the same diesel as 27 trucks so you get<br>win-win there get a very clear<br>assessment of exactly which parts of the<br>city will be worse damaged by increased<br>floods and um and uh adverse of weather<br>events and concentrate the money there<br>for part of the money there I'm very I<br>think the Council made a brave decision<br>to put aside a large sum for this and we<br>should maximize the benefit that we can<br>get from it okay for me it's about<br>electrifying the fleet and getting those<br>but I know it's in there but I'm not<br>sure it's fully funded it's 177 million<br>as I understand it to actually get that<br>Fleet electrified by 2030 and making<br>sure we've got infrastructure to support<br>the migration of vehicles to low and and<br>no emission Vehicles so that's a big one<br>for me<br>um I think it's I am actually this this<br>mitigation is important as well I have<br>been out to how I can seen some of the<br>challenges there I think we do need to<br>be focusing on areas at most risk<br>closing statements now three years time<br>you've been mayor for three years you're<br>reflecting on what has been achieved if<br>you've done it will be a proud city a<br>city that'll look at what we've done and<br>made sure that our children have<br>opportunities for the future we'll have<br>people looking in from overseas into our<br>city whether it's Singapore Busan Taiwan<br>Samoa thinking I want to go there<br>because like what the Auckland plan says<br>it is our Maori identity that sets us<br>apart a city that is as diverse a city<br>that welcomes inclusion a city where<br>Fair free public transport means we're<br>connected it again we're getting it to<br>our universities we're getting through<br>to meeting up with friends and family<br>that's the kind of City I want where<br>we're connected and we're going to have<br>a city that's going to grow 2.4 million<br>people in the next 18 to 20 years that's<br>a city that needs to be connected a city<br>that is respecting of one another and a<br>city that's going to be led by a mere<br>that you can be proud of that you will<br>look at and think that is Auckland that<br>is Auckland on the world stage that is<br>Auckland on the domestic stage and it's<br>time that we all lift our eyes and dream<br>again for a brand new city that's going<br>to take us forward<br>okay in three years time the city Rail<br>Link will be finished the eastern and<br>western both busways will be finished<br>the city will be cleared of construction<br>work and you'll be able to move around<br>it better the buses will be sped up with<br>it the finances will be under control<br>and will be starting to put away money<br>for new projects which we choose Light<br>Rail will be parked the three Waters<br>won't have happened the containers will<br>be delivered on trains the cars will be<br>gone and they'll be starting a new build<br>on release holds land where the cars are<br>now bringing parks and new restaurants<br>and businesses down to the city<br>and the city will be safe right across<br>from wellsford to<br>um pukekohe and we'll have a government<br>which is actually listening to Auckland<br>and a bit scared of the mayor thanks<br>very much yes I would like to be saying<br>well done to those inside Council who<br>have helped turn Auckland Council into a<br>service provider well done to that team<br>who have ended up working for the people<br>and provided them with the services that<br>they're actually wanting where their<br>rates is going to be spent and how they<br>get around the city and how services are<br>provided to them and this is right down<br>to parks and spaces Sport and Recreation<br>the ability to have a park like<br>Center in the CBD changing it to a Civic<br>District instead of a business district<br>pedestrianized the lower section of<br>Queen Street and let's have people going<br>there in a family-centric environment<br>let's have people after three years<br>saying hey my streets are clean my<br>gutters have been cleaned out my drains<br>have been unblocked the culverts are<br>cleared we've trimmed the trees from the<br>power lines all those basic core<br>services that everyone moans to me about<br>day after day I wanted three years them<br>to be saying thank you for having a<br>council that is actually doing those<br>jobs the jobs they're paid to do and the<br>main role of council is core services<br>not Social Services serving the people<br>with core Services we'll put a fiso in<br>to do social services and government<br>that's his job he'll be brilliant at it<br>I believe to unlock the potential of our<br>region and come out of covert well we<br>have to address the top issues facing us<br>so within three years I do want to have<br>made a tangible impact on the issues<br>that I've talked on the solutions that<br>I've talked about tonight<br>most importantly for me I actually want<br>to see a change in the culture how we're<br>engaging with our communities how we're<br>caring about their needs how to make<br>sure we're not inflicting things on them<br>that they're angry about I want to have<br>a more united place that people actually<br>feel when decisions are made they<br>actually trust them and respect them<br>even if they don't always like them that<br>is what I'm seeing is missing at the<br>moment and that is the difference that I<br>Sean sharp I think if they saw and Craig<br>helped each other they held themselves<br>well this and Wayne could have done a<br>bit better<br>um definitely not their best foot<br>forward<br>um I think once or later on but what<br>I've been looking at specifically is how<br>they cater to the youth and for students<br>and only two of them mentioned that so<br>we're at a university and no one talked<br>about students exactly each in their own<br>way created emotional connections with<br>the audience some of them negative some<br>of them positive that's really important<br>to make those connections if voters are<br>then going to hear the messages that<br>you're trying to sell<br>I would have expected a stronger female<br>candidate being the only female you've<br>got so much to to push for<br>um<br>that's probably just one for Craig<br>for someone who has um<br>in a lot of my friend circles and a lot<br>of the the students that I communicate<br>with a lot of controversy are<br>controversial thoughts<br>um the one comment that he said if<br>that's what the people want that's what<br>we'll do you know<br>um that's what I guess Truman would do<br>I still find the climate position by<br>Craig Lord a little bit hard to Fathom<br>but you know maybe that's just me but<br>but I do think that you know people<br>really care about climate change and the<br>student activists in this city have been<br>out in their thousands many times over<br>the last three years since the last<br>election my other big surprises where<br>was housing in this debate I think you<br>could ask any aucklander from any Walk<br>of Life that that housing and<br>intergenerational housing poverty is a<br>really critical issue for this city I<br>mean anyone can come and look at<br>Financial reports and then set up in<br>throw numbers at us right but it's it's<br>what they actually do when they get in<br>that role can they actually deliver I<br>truly don't know and it's not just them<br>it's the team behind them how inclusive<br>was their message how Visionary were<br>they how aspirational were they for our<br>city did they want us to be a global<br>city were they passionate about their<br>message and were they fiscally<br>responsible did they care about<br>co-governance and that it means<br>partnership and management under titriti<br>and did they care about marginalized<br>voters and how to get the um the youth<br>vote out and so on that basis my vote<br>goes to offesso Collins<br>learning to listen to the people and to<br>what they need it starts from the<br>students and it ends up in I guess the<br>population so I'm gonna have to say<br>official I guess the person with the<br>fewest black marks um next to his name<br>to tonight um was officer Collins<br>perhaps because he didn't put his foot</p></main><footer
