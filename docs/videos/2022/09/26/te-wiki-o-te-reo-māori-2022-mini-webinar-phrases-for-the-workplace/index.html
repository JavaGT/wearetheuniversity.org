welcome along to the first<br>day of tuition Maori<br>and this session entitled Mario Mahi<br>easy ways to use Tito Maori when at work<br>I know some of you might have attended<br>the same session last year but rest<br>assured the content is a little bit<br>different so to keep the same categories<br>of things but there's some new phrases<br>so it's not just a rinse and repeat I<br>might just give it 30 seconds or so<br>for people who are still arriving to get<br>in here and then we can um we can get<br>started with our session which will just<br>be for about 15 minutes or so<br>um also because this is set up as a<br>webinar the best way to ask questions is<br>with the Q a feature because it allows<br>you to like upvote the questions that<br>you're most interested in hearing an<br>answer to because the chat you know<br>those of you especially who have taught<br>classes will know it can get quite<br>chaotic so that q a feature is really<br>handy<br>but it looks like pretty much most<br>people are here now the numbers are so<br>down a bit so we'll we'll get started<br>with this session<br>um just a few sort of easy phrases<br>to incorporate into your work life right<br>which is what we're all kind of doing<br>now um and as a setting really I think a<br>very potent setting for being able to<br>revitalize and normalize use of Tito<br>Omari especially like in the University<br>you know I feel like it's it's a very<br>sort of welcoming place<br>um for using to do in comparison to say<br>some other places where it can feel a<br>little more<br>risky to use the language so I divided<br>the session up same categories as last<br>year because I thought they were quite<br>good categories that kind of capture<br>um the the types of things that most of<br>us tend to be doing in our work so we're<br>going to step through today uh three<br>kind of sections and phrases related to<br>these different settings or aspects of<br>work right so the first one is<br>meetings something that all of us are<br>doing quite a bit of<br>so email openings last year I did email<br>sign-offs so I thought I'd do the other<br>end this year and the last one here is<br>which means break times you'll notice<br>all of these have na at the start which<br>is a way of indicating that I'm talking<br>about the plural instead of the singular<br>so Maori that is how you indicate a<br>plural is the use of right instead of<br>not having that there<br>cool so let's get started with nahui<br>talking about some phrases that you can<br>use<br>in your meetings one of the ones I<br>thought about this like maybe this is<br>more a reflection of how I the kind of<br>meeting Simon or how I do them but um I<br>kind of was thinking about phrases I<br>used quite a bit these days and this is<br>one that comes up quite often<br>um sorry for my likeness or like you<br>might say Sorry Sorry I'm Late would be<br>I'd say in English right but this is<br>actually I found this easier to<br>translate into Maori into tirio so if<br>you wanted to say you know you turn up<br>to a meeting later you're looking kind<br>of sheepish you want to say the<br>interview this is how you could say it<br>so you would say<br>um<br>280 Tango so arohamai is also a really<br>good phrase to know until because it<br>means sorry so you can use that for any<br>situation where you need to apologize<br>for my true lady so late by itself will<br>just be two dating we put the tongue out<br>sorry for my likeness handy one to know<br>if you're like me and you sort of tend<br>to be a bit tardy with your meeting<br>attendance another one right so you<br>probably if you get to a meeting and<br>you're late then you probably miss like<br>a lot of important details that you need<br>to catch up on<br>um so you're probably going to have some<br>questions right that you need to ask to<br>get up to speed so if you wanted to say<br>I have a question how would you say that<br>in well it's actually very simple you<br>some of you might notice but others<br>might not some of these letters you see<br>you have the little macron on top like<br>party their first a and so if it has<br>that it means you hold it for longer<br>right<br>um so that changes actually the meaning<br>of the word it's like a little bit like<br>how and you know like Mandarin there's<br>different tones and Maori some of the<br>the letters you've got to hold them out<br>longer to convey the meaning right so<br>that's how you would say I have a<br>question<br>um<br>you might also if you're running the<br>meeting a common thing that we ask is<br>like do you have any questions right is<br>there something that you want to ask or<br>you might look looking at the person who<br>turned up like thinking it doesn't look<br>like they're quite on board maybe I<br>should check in with them so you might<br>want to ask them do you have a question<br>and actually it's a very similar phrase<br>but we just change the ending right so<br>instead of talking about ourselves we're<br>talking about someone else so you would<br>say<br>right do you have a question so the<br>ending is the ending has just changed<br>from the last one and still saying hey<br>partai taku I have a question we say<br>here<br>and phrased as a what's that you know<br>what infliction at the end so people<br>know that you're asking a question<br>yeah<br>um so those are some phrases for for<br>meetings right<br>um maybe if we just quickly step back so<br>we can cover those up sorry from my<br>lateness<br>do you have a question<br>time<br>right so those are our three phrases for<br>meetings hopefully those are useful the<br>next time you turn up late to a meeting<br>and you don't know what's going on<br>um uh so the next sort of segment for<br>today's session I thought we could cover<br>so ways of opening your emails and I<br>think I feel like this is something most<br>people are pretty comfortable with these<br>days I see a lot of people doing this in<br>the emails already around the university<br>which is awesome so all I really wanted<br>to do here is give you just a couple of<br>extras I suppose right because<br>I use the same analogy last year the<br>sort of car analogy but you know kyota<br>everyone I guess knows that means hello<br>hi and it's like the Toyota Corolla of<br>kind of email openings you know it's<br>solid it's reliable it's consistent you<br>can never go wrong with that so it's<br>it's totally fine it's good another one<br>though and this is one like as the Maori<br>speaker when someone uses this somewhere<br>okay I'm trying to like you know you're<br>sort of getting to that that next level<br>or using something a little bit<br>different is when people open with 10<br>dark queen right again you see the<br>macron zero on the on the air and the R<br>so it means you've got to hold them 10<br>now Queen meaning greetings to you so<br>this is sort of like a slightly sportier<br>version of the Toyota Corolla right but<br>then with just with those two things<br>right if you already have those two<br>things in your kit here and you're using<br>them you can actually there are a few<br>things you can add on right a little bit<br>like this car uh with all these things<br>kind of added on to it to make it I<br>don't know a little more interesting I<br>suppose<br>um yeah so some of these add-ons that<br>are helpful for adding on to those those<br>openings are these ones here<br>right so you can add these words onto<br>the openings to kind of<br>contextualize the opening depending on<br>who it is you're speaking to right so<br>the obvious one again many people know<br>this one Kilda Koto that's where you're<br>speaking to a group so you're saying<br>like hi everyone or you know in this in<br>the Southern States of America they<br>might say hi Yao right<br>um if you're speaking to two people<br>though instead of a group so I'm Maori<br>there is that distinction you see a lot<br>between peers or dyads and groups it's<br>different so you wouldn't say Koto if<br>you're just speaking to two other people<br>and said you were saying like<br>hello you two right so that is important<br>sometimes people are First Learning<br>today or you see them kind of figuring<br>out when to use those two things right<br>so Koto is for a group so three or more<br>Cordova is for two people another thing<br>if you're like friendly with someone or<br>you know them you know instead of saying<br>um just Kilda you can say kelder right<br>we can say<br>um you can say<br>so it's a way of sort of casualizing the<br>message and making it feel a little more<br>informal and intimate I suppose<br>um if you're talking to your team so if<br>it's email to your team you can still<br>use Koto right but if you want to show<br>that it's specific to your team you<br>could see something like<br>right High team something I use a lot<br>with the the tutors for example on my<br>course<br>um and another one that you can use if<br>you've been fortunate enough to receive<br>um Dougal McNeil's messages he's very<br>good at using this one so koamahima at<br>um that means colleagues right so it's<br>all your work colleagues basically so<br>all of these things you can add on to<br>those those initial ones 10 Aqua is a<br>little bit trickier than Kilda with<br>Kilda you can just add these things<br>straight on to the end and it makes<br>you can add all those things on it's<br>fine with tinakui you have to take out<br>the queer often right so instead of<br>saying you want to say 10 now create<br>Koto because it's saying hello you all<br>it doesn't really make sense you would<br>say Tina krito<br>right but then if you are talking to an<br>individual person you leave the queer in<br>so if I want to say<br>right hello there friend right greetings<br>friend did I leave it in<br>um with team again that's a little bit<br>trickier so you would say tinakoto right<br>hello everyone so it's quite a long one<br>um and same with<br>right so you've got a with the tinaku<br>you've got to think about whether the<br>quest stays in there or you swap it out<br>for a Koto or a corduro right so it's a<br>little bit more testy<br>um but it's good kind of practice and<br>it's good to mix it up a bit too and<br>people who who speak Maori are learning<br>Maori they'll notice you kind of you<br>know doing these things and and respect<br>the effort I certainly do when I see<br>people sort of go that next step it's<br>really going again not saying anything's<br>wrong with kyota kyota is awesome as I<br>said it's like Toyota Corolla best<br>selling car New Zealand everyone loves<br>it right it's consistent it's awesome<br>but um you can be a little bit more<br>interesting and daring with some of your<br>email openings<br>um as well as just helping to<br>contextualize the message right to the<br>specific situation you're communicating<br>in<br>um<br>so the last it's a little bit on the the<br>email openings<br>um the last sort of section and again<br>I've kept this from last year is things<br>that you can say on your break times<br>which again is another very important<br>important part of work right it's what<br>we do is it's how we socialize and<br>everything so it's good to know a few<br>phrases to use the<br>um one of the things I find is often<br>you know in terms of small talk around<br>the university question people love to<br>ask is sort of are you teaching these<br>days of academics at least right because<br>that is often a big way that academics I<br>suppose organize their calendars and and<br>you can sort of get a sense of their<br>their mood based on whether they're<br>teaching or not if they're kind of<br>frazzled and a little bit stressed out<br>chances are they are<br>um so are you teaching these days how<br>would we say that interior uh you would<br>say Kate<br>right so you can see the colors sort of<br>try and approximate the the parts of the<br>English sentence that they capture but<br>um is the word for for teach but if we<br>wanted to say teaching like anything of<br>Maori if you put at the start of<br>it it means that you're it's something<br>that you're doing right so teach is the<br>word but if we want to say that we're<br>teaching that we're doing that then we<br>would say right and that you can<br>actually put that at the start of almost<br>any word to create their their meaning<br>um so yeah out goes away for<br>teaching and these days Ian Ada right<br>everyone knows I suppose the word<br>meaning<br>um another thing that often happens on<br>break times is you react to things that<br>people say the stories that they tell<br>you or something that happens on the<br>weekend right and often it's like oh no<br>like not that they're teaching like I<br>love teaching teaching is awesome but<br>like things that could happen to them<br>and you want to express that reaction<br>and the one of the ways and Maori people<br>do this this is the most common way<br>people do is they say oh where right oh<br>where I use that with my daughter all<br>the time when we're talking and you're<br>telling me a story about something<br>shocking that happened that cool Hunger<br>you say oh where you know and it's sort<br>of just an expression of of that<br>sentiment of oh no that's not a good<br>thing<br>um so yeah it's a really good one to use<br>a very simple you know and and it's an<br>easy thing to incorporate into that sort<br>of not just the formal language of work<br>like not just emails but like the<br>informal language you know if you're<br>talking with someone and you want to<br>express that reaction oh yeah it's<br>really really good and easy way to do<br>that and the opposite of that because we<br>don't just want to react to people's<br>negative stuff we also want to know how<br>to react to the good stuff is like if<br>something happens and you must say oh<br>it's awesome it's great that's amazing<br>um there's lots of ways I was thinking<br>about this yesterday when I put these<br>slicing on actually there's a lot of<br>ways you can say it into doing mugly<br>um these are just some of them by the<br>way there's others and there's some that<br>are like specific to certain like more<br>specific to certain door here like<br>regions or Justina ewe they have their<br>own sort of idioms and ways that they<br>put this but these are some of the most<br>common ones right you might say cut away<br>you might say Tokyo you might say miharo<br>or you might say<br>right a few more words in there come out<br>there we're here is a really cool one<br>because the idea of Wiki is kind of we<br>don't have time to get into it here but<br>if you just Google Wiki Maori you'll be<br>able to find some stuff that tells you<br>it goes all the way back to the sort of<br>um the traditional kind of Maori view of<br>emotions and things and it incorporates<br>the idea of Wiki into that expression so<br>it's a really cool one in that sense<br>because it's not just a phrase It's<br>actually connecting you to that sort of<br>Maori perspective on strong emotions<br>right so it's a long thing to kind of<br>explain and it probably mess it up but<br>definitely Google it and see there's a<br>lot of resources online that will<br>explain that concept of Wiki to you so<br>it's kind of cool in that sense as well<br>not that the other ones are bad or<br>anything other ones are all totally fine<br>and valid and I use them all the time<br>myself<br>um but yeah I think it's a that last one<br>come out here where he had give us a<br>special<br>shout out to and encourage you to think<br>of ways of incorporating it in because<br>it is cool how it connects with the yeah<br>their sort of tower Maori in terms of<br>its its view of emotions uh so I think<br>that's all I had I remember from last<br>year so kumato finished<br>um I remember last year there were quite<br>a few questions that people had<br>um<br>um so Fernando asked I think it click<br>that's alive<br>does the University have any more<br>advanced courses available to our<br>students I think they they so University<br>I know does have a tadillo program that<br>they run<br>for<br>um<br>for staff I can't remember the name of<br>it on my head but I know it's on like<br>the staff intranet that they offer those<br>classes if you did want to go to the<br>next level I mean there's also the<br>tedill classes you know that that we run<br>for students that anyone can sort of<br>enrolling so that is the option too to<br>sort of go to the next level and another<br>really good question<br>um that's the name tehapai yeah<br>um and<br>Fernando asked another really good<br>question is what's the difference<br>between ah next to each other and R with<br>the macron so if you're from tainui sort<br>of waikato<br>right they often spell<br>the they don't use the macron right this<br>is sort of a tradition a difference in<br>convention they will use those two<br>letters next to each other to indicate<br>the longer are right so that is a a<br>spelling that is specific to that sort<br>of group and often if someone it's<br>actually quite handy because if someone<br>uses that in an email I can tell that<br>they're from their head or here so I can<br>sort of<br>as well so I can kind of you know make<br>that connection so it's very handy<br>sometimes too like in the word facade or<br>that isn't a macron that's actually the<br>two words next to each other and it's<br>just that the two A's happen to be side<br>by side right so they they join up but<br>yeah if you see someone using the Double<br>A's instead of a macron it's a good sign<br>that they're from the sort of White<br>Castle door here and they're using there<br>where it's belonging out<br>um<br>I think that's<br>all the questions<br>hold on uh um Mary colleagues what about<br>one colleague<br>um<br>I'll just sitting on my email what about<br>one colleague yeah<br>you would say if you wanted to say hello<br>my colleague I mean I would just say<br>like<br>I'll just keep it at Kilda or tinakui<br>but if you did want to be really<br>specific you could say<br>um<br>foreign<br>person so yes that would be using it for<br>one person if you wanted to ask that of<br>many people and say in the meeting then<br>you could say<br>um<br>right I think I might have missed that<br>up maybe someone else has said it<br>differently but I think that's how I<br>would say it or<br>um you could also say kayakoto<br>do you have any questions right so a<br>couple of different ways you could do<br>that but yeah<br>would generally be just for asking that<br>um she's like a good one how do you say<br>Hello friends plural<br>um<br>yep so adding the ma you see that right<br>or sometimes that like<br>um with my daughter and her friends you<br>might say tamarikima ma is a way of<br>saying you know all of you so you could<br>say or<br>um<br>yeah<br>right whereas if you leave the mat off<br>it's just singular right<br>is just talking to one person<br>Gilda<br>all right<br>well I think we went a little bit over<br>time but Katy Perry hopefully that's<br>been um<br>helpful and useful for all of you and<br>I'm glad I was able to get through all<br>of the questions this year because I<br>wasn't able to do that last year<br>um but yeah we'll leave it there all the<br>best for the rest of Maori hopefully<br>some of those phrases you can find a way<br>to incorporate into your day or two year<br>week and yeah all the best with it let's<br>um let's keep up the court little this</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
