so<br>um<br>yeah I think that means that we're<br>recording<br>um okay so this discussion today is just<br>looking at bilingualism<br>and what that means um for bicultural<br>Museum and so I just um this beautiful<br>picture of<br>um<br>hoodie uh who lives out here in otaki<br>um we can see that um in this picture<br>um you know that was taken all around<br>they've done a big mess of trip over to<br>um to New Zealand to Zealand<br>um and so what we can see is that are<br>paying a decent<br>um<br>physical and financial prop price to<br>making sure that aotearoa is<br>um is actively recognized as a<br>bicultural country so if we think about<br>where we where we are now this week<br>um so this week Max um<br>the 50th<br>um<br>uh 50th anniversary of the the Maori<br>language petition and what we saw was<br>um a massive turnout at Parliament on<br>Wednesday to support what we what we<br>recognize is a really massive Milestone<br>and all of these young people<br>um who are now our old people who are<br>now our komatua and we can see the<br>massive contributions that they've made<br>to ensuring that our language has<br>um has survived and is in the position<br>that we're in at the moment<br>um at a great cost<br>um to to themselves<br>um and<br>um yeah so I just want to meet you to<br>all of all of those people who have<br>ensured that we've um we've been unable<br>to actually have what we have at the<br>moment<br>so if we think about what was going on<br>in<br>um 2006 even looking at some of the<br>attitudes towards Studio Maori in 2006<br>which isn't you know that long ago<br>um<br>we saw that in the attitudes that<br>tippini corpity attitude survey<br>um so 15 of have util Maori is a<br>high priority for themselves<br>um and 35<br>indicated that they would really like to<br>be involved in things to do with Maori<br>culture and so what we see at the moment<br>is quite a massive shift in the opposite<br>direction so we've had a lot a lot more<br>uptake<br>um about who is engaging in real Maori<br>spaces<br>so um you know it's it's yeah these are<br>just some<br>some people that are really awesome<br>um so we have um you know another Rob<br>unfortunately<br>um<br>so we've had a lot of Pacquiao<br>supportives of terial Maori prior to the<br>point where we have it um at its current<br>kind of attractiveness of how attractive<br>it is to to people now and so and a lot<br>of these people on the screen and you<br>know they also sort of it wasn't a<br>neutral space to go be going into<br>interior Maori spaces when and they<br>chose to be going into those spaces so<br>um yeah<br>um you know that was perhaps there was a<br>there was a lot of risk for these<br>individuals<br>um so I also see real solidarity so a<br>lot of<br>um<br>uh coming into Maori language spaces as<br>well and is recognition for<br>um the fact that<br>um you know they want to have a<br>relationship with tunita<br>um isaki so as indigenous peoples of<br>this country and this is an alcohol<br>one of our previous graduates and as<br>well as ini so<br>um some whanau who have migrated to<br>aotearoa who have decided to to take on<br>Tyrion Maori so there are a lot of um<br>motivations for by by culturalism and by<br>those who choose to invest in this space<br>so some of my previous research has<br>looked at motivations of pagia who have<br>chose to learn terial Maori and one of<br>the things that is interesting is this<br>idea of social identity Theory and so<br>part of<br>the rationale behind some<br>um Pacquiao who have chosen to do you<br>know engage into the old Maori in the<br>past and has partly been in response to<br>um<br>kind of moving away from some of those<br>more racist views about tidio Maori so<br>so on the one hand if we if we think<br>about social identity is um<br>as you know sort of<br>positioning oneself in a way that is<br>more favorable<br>um in their own perceptions of what you<br>know what a good New Zealander might<br>look like or what what a person from<br>aotearoa looks like<br>um who is perhaps<br>um behaving in a way that is more<br>aligned to<br>um being a good citizen<br>and what we found was that a lot of<br>individuals<br>um found you know found other<br>like-minded people to support their real<br>Maori Journey so um in this particular<br>study<br>um pakia talked about the fact that<br>Maori culture acted for them as a symbol<br>of national<br>identity so rather than seeing it as<br>something that was specific to Maori and<br>they few they viewed this as being kind<br>of something more<br>um more a part of what it meant to be a<br>member of aotearoa so um yeah this is<br>you know just a couple of a couple of<br>quotes here so because I'm a New Zealand<br>Parker here you go look I'm a New<br>Zealander I don't identify with English<br>culture I don't identify with German<br>culture I'm Still A New Zealand Parker<br>Hut and if these are the official<br>languages of New Zealand I should<br>probably know them okay so there were<br>some really pragmatic<br>um decisions that were going on there<br>but they clearly linked to this idea of<br>um so what we've seen recently is is<br>kind of a a larger influx of<br>um non-maori who are learning to deal<br>and this is<br>um yeah this is creating some some new<br>challenges I suppose in the space and so<br>what Professor Allison Jones<br>um you know she's done a lot of research<br>and education and the positionality of<br>Parker<br>um in education spaces<br>um and you know<br>trying to encourage<br>um pakija to be<br>um not at the center of the discussion<br>so some of her research<br>um you know earlier research 2001 she's<br>she's had a lot of um picardo about<br>these things so in this article here<br>tangata and so she she encourages<br>pakihar to come into this real Maori<br>space<br>um<br>yeah really thinking about<br>positionality and what it means to be a<br>Parker<br>um in this space of reclamation<br>um so what we know for tonight is that<br>you know learning titillium Maori is<br>very personal<br>um anybody that's seen killed a good<br>evening<br>and<br>uh the the other night you know we saw<br>um Mike in in some in a really<br>vulnerable position and that's what a<br>lot of our tangata finra are doing when<br>they are firstly engaging in their<br>um and their ancestral language and so<br>we've got people who are engaging in<br>Tere or Maori from a number of various<br>um identity positions and for a number<br>of different reasons and so if we have<br>Maori who have come into this space<br>trying to think about what it means to<br>reclaim the language what what it means<br>to be thinking about all of the reasons<br>why they are in perhaps an institution<br>or a formal learning environment<br>learning their own ancestral language<br>um and some of the colonial violence<br>that created those conditions and that's<br>a very different experience than some of<br>those other reasons for learning<br>material that and we've just seen time<br>so this is one of the quotes from<br>another study Maori and so this is a<br>report that's available on the mataway<br>website<br>um so yeah just so this person<br>um who has a pseudonym here and so there<br>was a political kind of you know it<br>became about<br>thinking about politics of being Maori<br>and stuff and I know<br>um that parkia colleagues tries really<br>hard to do that well you know being a<br>package speaker of tidal and she tries<br>really hard to put other poker hair in<br>place when they become kind of you know<br>I'm going to answer all these questions<br>or you know so she's talking about in<br>this particular quote she's talking<br>about<br>um<br>um yeah the fact that they haven't lost<br>their language it's a it's a luxury to<br>to pick up a language<br>um<br>yeah so<br>um and also the fact that there are<br>resourcing implications so one of<br>um the recent studies showed that it<br>cost a hundred and eighty thousand<br>dollars for one couple to to um to take<br>a year off studying uh sorry to take a<br>year off work to study teddial Maori<br>um in a full immersion environment so<br>um there are different costs to actually<br>being able to engage in these spaces and<br>and we know that you know<br>um<br>this can be a massive barrier<br>so what we've seen recently is an<br>encouragement by a lot of a lot of Maori<br>people to to Really<br>um encourage peop people who are coming<br>into these Maori language spaces to act<br>with<br>um<br>with kindness with humility<br>um and yeah so as<br>um<br>talks about here<br>um if you're if you are Parker a<br>Learning Studio please be gentle with<br>Maori who haven't had the same<br>opportunity to learn their language so<br>you know there are there are a number of<br>different Dynamics going on here so you<br>know while we're all supportive of<br>biculturalism and by I'm sorry<br>bilingualism and we understand that you<br>know perhaps some of those costs or<br>perhaps unpacking some of those language<br>trauma have been a reason why some of<br>our own people haven't actually had an<br>opportunity to um to gain their Heritage<br>language so there's a lot going on in<br>our society at the moment<br>so again this this is from that manual<br>City that are saying that we've got on<br>the Tomato Hawaii website<br>um so<br>I asked<br>um our participants you know so this was<br>a national study and I asked some of our<br>participants um you know how they felt<br>about being in classes with RKO and<br>um if they could impart some<br>and words of encouragement to to pakeha<br>who were engaging in these little Maori<br>spaces what kind of advice would they<br>ask for<br>um and everybody you know a kind of<br>hands down most people said this idea of<br>you know<br> oh so um you know so thinking about<br>manakitanga is a central way of engaging<br>um acknowledging positionality<br>acknowledging the history acknowledging<br>the privilege of even being able to<br>learn to deal Maori and those were all<br>things that came through<br>um also thinking about<br>um so they raised other ideas around<br>um how often Pacquiao were comfortable<br>um asking questions<br>um so centering themselves and doing<br>Maori discussions those were things that<br>um Maori who were Learners of Terio<br>Maori<br>um asked pakihad to kind of be conscious<br>of<br>so you know this particular study was<br>done quite a few years ago now so it was<br>about eight years ago<br>um<br>but<br>um yeah what we see is that terial Maori<br>does provide parkour with tools of<br>Engagement<br>um in ways of thinking about this but<br>one of the interesting things that has<br>happened more recently is the shift in<br>the numbers of of Poker and some of our<br>classes so you know in 101 for instance<br>we had 58 of that class where Parker had<br>compared with<br>um 42 who are Maori so even just those<br>numbers that share<br>um you know sort of security and numbers<br>and<br>um that sort of changes the dynamic from<br>even just five years ago really when we<br>were um when they were um it was more of<br>a sort of an equal balance of who was<br>who was learning to deal particularly in<br>that tertiary space<br>so<br>um mainstream views okay and so what<br>we've seen is the role of the media the<br>media have played a considerable role in<br>the dehumanization of our population<br>which contributed to the stuff's<br>um apology to tangata finra so the<br>labeling of of Maori and these shows the<br>racial profiling and this all<br>contributes to a negative perception of<br>humalia so on the one hand we also see<br>that Maori are the number one<br>um racial group who are victimized in<br>New Zealand and 93 of participants in a<br>2019 study National study<br>um was Cheryl Smith and colleagues<br>um showed that yeah 93 of Maori<br>participants experience racism on a<br>daily basis so<br>um how does tidal impact on racism<br>um so what we see is you know it's a<br>national symbol of identity it's<br>something that it can help people engage<br>with Maori but really does it get to the<br>Crux of the issue which is racism<br>and so you know some of the responses<br>here<br>um so I ignore them by by Nature I'm not<br>a political you know particularly<br>confrontational person<br>um but this is kind of you know being<br>able to ignore racist comments that's<br>kind of a position of privilege as well<br>so what we've seen more recently is kind<br>of a um<br>a call I suppose to Parker how to<br>um to respond to racism that is directed<br>toward Maori<br>um and you know this participant here<br>talks about the fact that races tend to<br>respect their opinions of<br>um white people more and at the very<br>least I'll be a white person who<br>understands Maori and confront people uh<br>who I interact with<br>um in ways that might get listened to<br>yeah so I mean this is a really<br>important Point<br>um but also being careful not to speak<br>on behalf of Maori so knowing those<br>differences so this is um we're very<br>closely I'm sorry so just another<br>um what what it looks like to be a a<br>Ally in 2022 and Beyond<br>um so I really highly recommend people<br>watching and I'll other Sutherland and<br>documentary where nobody was looking<br>this is a beautiful example of what we<br>might hope to Aspire to so just a<br>reminder that language revitalization is<br>political so<br>um and this is just a comment from<br>theatrical who in response to the Lord<br>album last year so she said that the<br>work that we do to support tutil is an<br>extremely linked oh yeah look you've<br>seen that quite you can read yourselves<br>um and this is my book that's out next<br>week so<br>um there are some bits and pieces that<br>might be relevant there okay so I'll<br>so I've just got one question<br>um<br>yeah thanks for for tuning in so how do<br>you feel oh sorry how do you feel about<br>poker learning to deal on free courses<br>provided by Maori such as to hermana<br>um I had been accepted onto a course but<br>I am hesitant<br>as I have heard views that Park here<br>should step back from these courses as<br>they are intended for Maori to learn<br>them easier<br>um it really depends on the long-term<br>um nature of your<br>investment so if you're<br>um if you're just wanting to learn TDL<br>for a few uh pronunciation<br>um tips or<br>um you know you don't really have a<br>long-term goal and actually gaining<br>fluency to a communicative uh level then<br>some of the free courses<br>um in online courses are really good as<br>an option<br>um just responding to that particular<br>question<br>um yeah so<br>um but yeah the whole the whole<br>resourcing thing that that's that's an<br>issue at the moment because we have you<br>know we have the same kind of relatively<br>same amount of teachers and etc etc but<br>we've had a an increased number of<br>interests so we're just trying to manage<br>those um those competing<br>um<br>challenges but also you know I think<br>yeah if you if if you're if you have the<br>means to enroll and say like a<br>um a paid course and that's also um an<br>option<br>um that would be positive<br>so and it has asked<br>um what needs to happen to support Maori<br>who have no contact with whanau loss of<br>trust and education<br>um lots of things need to happen<br>um<br>yeah so that's part of the whole<br>the whole challenge is that a lot of<br>people are coming into the old Maori<br>spaces to reconnect with who they are<br>and through the process of gaining<br>confidence until Maori and that often<br>leads to them feeling a little bit more<br>um confident to you know make those<br>other claims also in those real Maori<br>contexts they create social<br>relationships who can act to support<br>those aspirations so it's it's kind of<br>about that the healing Nation<br>uh sorry the healing notion of um yeah<br>that point<br>um sorry Lucas Yoda<br>um what's the role of Poker learning<br>today Maori and decolonization and the<br>decolonization of the entrepreneur<br>um yeah so kind of I guess I think um<br>positionality is is very important and<br>also learning about the history of<br>aotearoa is very important<br>um and also learning about<br>um racism and how it functions<br>um in in our society so<br>um I think the the challenge that we<br>have is that we have a lot of um really<br>well intended people so well-meaning who<br>are trying to come up with solutions for<br>um what they might do<br>who to to be better treaty partners and<br>and so what has been pushed forward as<br>an answer to that is Maori so that's<br>become<br>um you know that's become kind of a<br>solution to to being bicultural<br>um but what we know is that inaudible<br>Maori classes we don't address issues of<br>systemic racism we don't address<br>Colonial violence<br>um so all of those learnings are<br>incidental learnings<br>um but they really need to be understood<br>um in order for those those things of<br>manaki tangata actually<br>um<br>yeah they be actualized in a meaningful<br>way so um lots of things that poker can<br>do to support learning after Maori the<br>other thing is is that<br>um you know they<br>um<br>can can be helpful in um in the sharing<br>of resources and study tips and you know<br>other there's other good things um that<br>can come from collaborative<br>relationships and it's just around yeah<br>making sure that um that tangita fenua<br>are at the center of those discussions<br>and that the learning experiences of<br>Tunica<br>um are the are the central<br>Focus kind of of um in some of those<br>learning contexts so I don't know if<br>that sort of answers your question but<br>hopefully<br>um<br>um<br>that is another interesting point so<br>awesome that you have<br>um yeah so particularly so for for<br>parents who have um children with<br>whakapapa Maori<br>um<br>it's really important that you know you<br>do get involved and also as a papa<br>um you know you are demonstrating to<br>your kids the value of<br>terial Maori so<br>um so Parker who have Maori children<br>um I think you know if we are thinking<br>about the priority of who needs to go to<br>these things you're the people that need<br>to be and build Maori classes the other<br>people that<br>um that are really actually<br>um there's an urgency about Teddy Al<br>Maori it's not just a nice to have it's<br>kind of um there's a functional outcome<br>for what you're doing and yeah so um<br>yeah okay<br>and yeah<br>oh you'll see your book on my bookshelf<br>um yeah it's awesome to um<br>yeah that's that's really important that<br>we that we acknowledge also where racism<br>is coming from so um these are<br>deep-seated<br>um issues and they<br>um yeah they require a lot of systemic<br>thinking a lot of breaking down<br>um<br>yeah<br>um yeah so okay this is just about the<br>the support for the immersion programs<br>um<br>I I think you know mild immersion<br>education is pretty it's it's it's a big<br>um issue for us<br>um in terms of<br>um teacher shortage<br>um resources<br>um and you know in the covert times it's<br>just become even more you know<br>we've become more aware of what those<br>issues might be<br>um<br>so um yeah resourcing I think that the<br>thing that's another way that Parker can<br>support learning to deal is is actually<br>um arguing on our behalf for the the<br>correct allocation or resources to be<br>supported uh to support our people in<br>these spaces so<br>um yeah if we had Equitable funding to<br>actually deal with the issues that we're<br>dealing with in um in our multimedia and<br>education and that is a great use of<br>your decolonizing efforts if you are a<br>non-maori in this space<br>um yeah so cute don't know me<br>um thanks for for listening to me<br>stumbling through this uh presentation<br>and<br>um I wonder if we can<br>um put up some other links to so those<br>if you want to just check out my bio the<br>um the Parker papers are all on there<br>um I think the manawatu paper is on<br>there and then yeah the book is um is on<br>the th dump<br>um<br>the up<br>okay</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
