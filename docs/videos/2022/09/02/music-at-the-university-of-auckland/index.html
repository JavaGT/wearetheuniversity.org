courses in music<br>theory and music history and other<br>aspects of music study<br>i've been involved with music for about<br>as long as i can remember my mother is a<br>choir director in the united states so i<br>grew up surrounded by music in my house<br>sang in choirs all through high school<br>and then went to university for a music<br>degree and then on to the university of<br>oxford for my post-grad study and then<br>from there went here to auckland to<br>teach at the university<br>with me here today is one of our<br>composition students rochelle fernando<br>hi i'm rochieli i study<br>composition in my honours year<br>my family was quite a musical family my<br>mom and dad started performing in church<br>and they played music around the house<br>and it kind of influenced me as a kid<br>and so i gravitated to music in high<br>school that was where i started<br>composing and so that was where my<br>passion for composition grew<br>and that that was what led me to study<br>composition university<br>we have a number of different pathways<br>here at the school of music<br>you can focus on classical performance<br>jazz composition popular music or music<br>studies music studies is our newest<br>specialization and our broadest one so<br>if either you're not quite sure where<br>you want to go with music or if you want<br>the broadest bass possible music studies<br>would be a good choice for you that<br>specialization allows you to<br>have a taster of a few composition<br>courses<br>a few performance courses if you pass<br>the audition for those<br>plus music theory and music history<br>musicology courses as well<br>in the school of music we have a lot of<br>great facilities a number of different<br>performance spaces including a black box<br>space called the kenneth myers center we<br>have our music theater<br>we have this space which is our early<br>keyboard room and it's also used for<br>teaching and for chamber music<br>we have a number of classrooms we have a<br>whole block of practice rooms<br>teaching rooms here in the main building<br>as well as in a few other buildings<br>the first year of the bachelor of music<br>is your immersion into everything<br>musical you'll be taking a set of core<br>courses which include some music theory<br>courses and a course called contemporary<br>music culture which i teach<br>which covers music in all of its social<br>functions and forms dipping into various<br>case studies of music across times and<br>across cultures to explore<br>the role that music has in the world<br>today<br>you'll also start into your<br>concentration so if you're a composition<br>student you'll take some composition<br>papers if you are an instrumentalist<br>you'll start on your work with your<br>instrument or with your voice<br>if you're in jazz you'll start on jazz<br>if you're in popular music you'll start<br>with that as well<br>so the first year is both a taster of<br>the bigger picture of music as well as<br>an introduction to the specific area of<br>study that you've chosen because our<br>school of music is a quite tight-knit<br>community you'll have the opportunity to<br>collaborate with students on other<br>streams<br>you'll meet everybody in your core<br>classes<br>and<br>through those classes you'll be able to<br>form relationships with people all<br>across the school so if you're a<br>composer you'll know who you're writing<br>music for if you're a performer you'll<br>get to know composers who you might ask<br>to write you a piece rochelle can you<br>tell us a bit about your own first year<br>experience it was really overwhelming<br>because i just came out of high school<br>and<br>there were a lot of students as<br>opposed to my<br>my music class in high school there were<br>about like five<br>students in my music class so<br>yeah it was just overwhelming<br>and like you said there were a lot of<br>classes that we could take as a taster<br>i really enjoy the theory courses<br>and<br>one of my highlights from first year was<br>in<br>our<br>composition classes we got to perform<br>the pieces that we composed ourselves as<br>a short task<br>on any instrument and one of my friends<br>did hers with kazoos and they were all<br>stacked into each other and she<br>performed amazing another highlight was<br>taking a jazz history<br>course and<br>condensing the 100 or so years of<br>mostly american jazz history was really<br>interesting for me and fascinating and<br>it kind of propelled me to my inquiry<br>now as a postgraduate student<br>so in first year we<br>per semester we would have four classes<br>um a semester<br>and um normally we would be in campus<br>every day monday to friday<br>we have at least one class a day<br>i<br>there would be a mixture of one hour<br>lectures and maybe two hour lectures<br>tutorials we had them as part of<br>the<br>kind of main<br>courses and they would normally be one<br>hour<br>so you you might find that<br>you<br>are only in a lecture or in a tutorial<br>for a few hours every week but that's<br>only the tip of the iceberg to the the<br>work that you do at university you do a<br>lot of independent work writing your<br>essay assignments<br>making your composition practicing your<br>instrument collaborating with people<br>learning from each other as well as from<br>your lectures<br>so there's a wide range of activities<br>yeah and in composition we have<br>workshops every week on fridays where<br>students and guest composers can<br>demonstrate what they've been doing<br>recently<br>encouraging the young students to<br>improve evaluate their own compositions<br>in that way<br>all of our streams have a group class so<br>if you're a voice student you'll go to<br>voice class if you're a composition<br>student you'll go to composition<br>workshop<br>if you're a piano student you'll go to<br>piano class etc<br>and that as rochelle said that's a great<br>opportunity to learn from each other and<br>from a variety of different teachers<br>my favorite part of studying at<br>university was not only the classes i<br>loved them most of them<br>but<br>just the in-between moments kind of when<br>we're gathering before the class starts<br>just talking with friends sharing our<br>favorite music<br>together<br>yeah just that collaboration just<br>camaraderie<br>with with all the music students<br>regardless regardless of specializations<br>that<br>yeah that's my favorite part of uni<br>the application and entry process for<br>our degrees is fairly straightforward in<br>addition to the standard university<br>entrance requirements some of our<br>specializations require a little bit of<br>extra input from you<br>our performance streams require an<br>audition usually in person<br>that's what we prefer<br>because we get a chance to see you in<br>real life and also you get a chance to<br>meet<br>face-to-face with one of our staff<br>members so you can see if it's a good<br>fit but if you can't make it up to<br>auckland we can easily<br>allow an online audition as well<br>so as staff members what we want to see<br>from students is what they feel shows<br>them off best<br>we don't mind if it's a very specific<br>piece or a specific type of piece<br>we want your view of your own best work<br>for performance auditions there are a<br>series of dates that open throughout the<br>year those dates are advertised online<br>and when those dates come up you can<br>arrange an in-person audition or arrange<br>to send an online portfolio through<br>we will<br>give you a time to come in and perform<br>for us<br>a selection of pieces from your<br>repertoire<br>and you'll get the chance to work with<br>one of our staff members as well<br>on<br>whatever your instrument or voice might<br>be<br>and then<br>not too long after that we will get in<br>touch with you and let you know if you<br>have an offer of a place<br>we want to see who you are what you can<br>do<br>and what you can bring to us here at the<br>school of music<br>rochelle how did you find the admissions<br>it wasn't that difficult<br>waiting for the result i guess that's<br>part of<br>the process that was kind of<br>nerve-wracking<br>especially because i really wanted to<br>get in<br>students who come to study here have all<br>sorts of prior experiences<br>some of them took had already taken<br>their musical<br>skills to a very high level at school<br>others have come to music more recently<br>we offer some bridging courses that can<br>help you get the skills that you need to<br>take our more upper level courses for<br>example if you come in without a lot of<br>music theory knowledge you can take our<br>beginner's level course but if you<br>already know a lot of theory maybe from<br>from taking<br>a levels or ncea theory modules you<br>might be able to test out of that course<br>and go straight into the next one which<br>is more specialized no matter what your<br>experience is if you've got the talent<br>and if you've got the passion and if<br>you've got the<br>essential university entrance<br>requirements we can probably find a<br>place for you rochelle what kinds of<br>experiences had you had with music<br>before you started here<br>i am also a pianist so i have a piano<br>background<br>and also i sang in choirs in high school<br>and i still do in community choirs<br>so i had some vocal experience and piano<br>experience<br>i did not take any grades for piano but<br>i was roughly a grade five by the end of<br>year 13 so that kind of helped me in<br>theory and kind of keyboard techniques<br>in ncaa level 3 which is in year 13 i<br>did a couple of composition<br>internal standards<br>performance internal standards and for<br>the examinations i did oral and theory<br>papers and i also did the scholarship<br>music where i had to do a separate exam<br>and analyzing a piece<br>within the three hours of the exam and<br>also submit a portfolio for that<br>scholarship<br>my advice for anyone out there who's<br>thinking of applying to do music here at<br>the university<br>is to start stretching your ears start<br>listening as widely as you can<br>start learning theory a lot of people<br>don't like theory but some of us<br>think that it's the most<br>enjoyable part of music because it's<br>about learning how it works from the<br>inside<br>start thinking critically about what<br>you're hearing<br>and what you're doing and why you're<br>doing it when you make your creative<br>musical decisions we have many students<br>who do conjoint degrees<br>if you're not sure that music is where<br>you want to go as a career or if you've<br>got multiple avenues that you think<br>would be interesting a conjoint might be<br>a great decision<br>i did a conjoint myself as an undergrad<br>i did music in international relations<br>oh i did a conjunct too in arts and<br>music<br>so both of us seem to have chosen the<br>music side of things but having those<br>other skills<br>are useful for my music stuff as well<br>it's given me a different perspective<br>from what a lot of people have a broader<br>and wider perspective on the music<br>what do you think is there anything that<br>you wish you'd known before you started<br>well<br>i'm a huge introvert so um my advice to<br>myself<br>in starting<br>my university journey is to not be<br>afraid to make friends um networking and<br>collaborating is the main i think the<br>main thing that i've learned um from<br>university<br>because who else can i can perform my<br>compositions right<br>um yeah that's the main thing that i<br>would tell my younger self what i would<br>say to students is just embrace the<br>university life don't take it for<br>granted<br>three four years is not as long as you<br>think so<br>join that club<br>there are a lot of clubs that you can<br>join<br>there are a lot of music related ones<br>choirs chamber ensembles</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
