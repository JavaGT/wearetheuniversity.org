welcome to the um<br>the celebration of palavoci's promotion<br>to professor<br>for those who don't know me my name's<br>david murdock i'm the vice chancellor of<br>the university of otago and it's<br>one of my<br>great pleasures to be involved in these<br>wonderful events<br>as many of you know<br>our program of inaugural professoral<br>lectures have been rather disrupted over<br>the last two or three years with covet<br>and it's a delight now to see that we<br>are we are working through our backlog<br>and indeed<br>paula was uh promoted to professor at<br>the beginning of last year i think 2021<br>and was put off at least once so it's<br>really fantastic that we are into the<br>program again<br>um<br>my role is mainly to welcome everybody<br>and so<br>really a big big welcome to everybody<br>here to everyone's watching online<br>to the wider university community and<br>dunedin community who are watching and a<br>special<br>welcome to<br>paula's whanau and friends and i believe<br>we have some special guests here paula's<br>daughter ava<br>fantastic and son manu<br>fantastic<br>welcome<br>and i believe maybe<br>paula's sister gemma and her family may<br>be watching live from italy maybe not<br>maybe later on but a big big welcome and<br>i know there'll be other people who are<br>watching who have uh been involved and<br>and helped paolo along with her career<br>over many years so uh welcome to to<br>everybody<br>it's um also a bit of a become a bit of<br>a tradition that at the start of these<br>lectures just to highlight what how uh<br>what an achievement promotion to<br>professor is at the university of otago<br>and i mean the main message is it really<br>is<br>a high bar and that we have a rigorous<br>process<br>it requires a demonstration of<br>outstanding performance in<br>research teaching and service<br>with the professoral promotions it<br>requires demonstration of leadership<br>really importantly and usually in more<br>than one area so it is a high bar it<br>involves external reviewers most of whom<br>come from overseas<br>and certainly i like maybe some quite a<br>few here review for a number of overseas<br>universities and i've never encountered<br>a more rigorous process and promotion<br>that we have at otago so it is a a<br>really high bar so um really um just to<br>acknowledge and congratulate paula for a<br>very well deserved and and significant<br>promotion<br>i'm very very much looking forward to<br>your lecture<br>and um i'm going to hand over now to<br>brian to give<br>a more detailed introduction to pella<br>thank you vice chancellor um<br>i remember when paula began her career<br>here at otago in 2003<br>there was quite a sense of<br>expectation that preceded her arrival<br>part of that was personal china scholars<br>are thin on the ground at otago so it's<br>always nice to welcome another one to<br>the fold<br>but it was also a time when<br>the chinese program was<br>still rather fragile some people had<br>come and gone and we really wanted<br>someone to come and commit to the<br>program<br>to not only provide stability but bring<br>some energy and direction to the program<br>to help lift it up and chart its way<br>forward<br>and hopefully provide some leadership<br>and very quickly it became obvious that<br>paula was going to do all of those<br>things she brought that kind of unique<br>combination of enthusiasm and generosity<br>that distinguishes her<br>immediately to all the things that she<br>had to do<br>and we felt that that the chinese<br>program was now in really safe hands and<br>quickly she established a rapport with<br>her colleagues in the program but also<br>with her wider colleagues within the<br>department of languages and cultures of<br>which<br>the chinese program was a part<br>and soon she took on those leadership<br>roles<br>heading the chinese program and also<br>hitting<br>we got together to talk about this<br>briefly before<br>and<br>when we did that i learned that paula<br>first went to china<br>when she was still an undergraduate<br>student at the<br>university of venice in 1989 and 1989 of<br>course was a very<br>dramatic year in china so i'm hoping<br>that we hear a bit more about what<br>happened<br>in 1989 but then she went back again the<br>next year uh in a more formal way as a<br>as a foreign student<br>and unlike most of us who sought to get<br>a place in one of the sort of mainstream<br>prestigious universities like peking<br>university<br>paolo went to an institution that had<br>only just started accepting<br>foreign students and this was the<br>beijing film academy<br>and this was a decision that was going<br>to affect<br>her career in ways she probably didn't<br>realize at the time<br>um<br>the<br>the chinese film industry at this time<br>was was booming uh it had a huge<br>domestic audience but it was also<br>starting to generate quite significant<br>international attention so by being a<br>student at the film academy parlour was<br>able to meet and engage with<br>many of the innovative and creative<br>people that were at the heart of that<br>dynamic film industry and i think that<br>experience<br>then led on to the decisions she made<br>about her phd which she did at indiana<br>university<br>and following getting that phd in 2002<br>she came here to otago<br>and<br>a lot of that background then started to<br>feed into a whole raft of publications<br>that began to appear book chapters and<br>articles<br>and most importantly her book<br>china on video which appeared in 2010<br>so she was now<br>generating a significant international<br>reputation with that research profile<br>and with that<br>came the poachers<br>other institutions that thought we<br>should get hold of this person i<br>remember one instance where the<br>university of chicago really tried to<br>draw her away<br>and some people at the time said she was<br>mad not to go<br>but fortunately for us she decided to<br>stay and i think that decision had a lot<br>to do with otago but also about her<br>decision<br>that dunedin and otago would be a home<br>for her and her family<br>and from our point of view we were very<br>as she settled here she also began to<br>establish<br>more links nationally<br>she became a member of the new zealand<br>asian studies society and went on to<br>become president of the society and she<br>still edits the society's journal so she<br>has a prominent role nationally<br>in the field<br>and out of that came<br>new research collaborations and i'll<br>just mention one she produced a book<br>with the poet and translator luhuei on<br>china's soft power which came out in<br>2018.<br>there are a lot of other publications i<br>could mention but i'll leave it at that<br>but i will say that one of the things<br>that distinguishes paola's scholarship<br>is that she deals with what we call the<br>other china<br>so this is not the china that we hear<br>about in the media all the time the<br>party state with its very<br>singular<br>narrow view of what china is and what it<br>means to be chinese<br>the other china is<br>the china where most chinese people live<br>their daily lives and i think anyone<br>who's been to china will know<br>that immediately you encounter this as<br>an incredibly diverse place with lots of<br>different languages lots of different<br>cultures and traditions and the<br>interaction of those things produces a<br>very dynamic<br>and stimulating environment and right<br>through parlor's research is an attempt<br>to<br>convey that other china to<br>people<br>from<br>outside the china world<br>to give those people in a sense a voice<br>to express their their hopes their<br>aspirations<br>i think there's more i could say about<br>you paolo but i think i'll leave it at<br>that and i think i'll just finish by<br>saying<br>that and i think i'm probably uh<br>expressing this on behalf of everyone<br>here that we are very glad that you are<br>our colleague so please welcome paula<br>okay<br>i think brian has done everything i<br>think i should just stand it here<br>quadriatico<br>here<br>so magritte's famous painting and the<br>actual title is actually the treachery<br>structures of images<br>is a provocative encounter between<br>images and words it's<br>this is not a pipe which reminds us that<br>there is a gap between what is and can<br>be represented and what is there in the<br>world<br>in pointing us to this gap and provoking<br>us to see and read beyond what claims to<br>be an unquestionable self-evident this<br>is a pipe<br>this is not a pipe it's not just a<br>negative statement but<br>a proposition that asks us to question<br>the unquestionable<br>well there is also humor in this<br>painting's provocative statement which<br>just a few images<br>memes from this increasingly deceptive<br>and even dangerously brand washing<br>internet not all humor is created equal<br>some of these memes seem<br>seem to simply play with the idea of<br>this is not right the treachery of<br>images others are used to comment to<br>some quite serious political and social<br>issues now i've taken my great this is<br>not as a means to share with you my<br>so i begin<br>but this is not a professor or whatever<br>you might think a professor is for one<br>thing i'm borrowed i'm wearing a<br>borrowed regalia<br>which is clearly too long for me<br>and it's not from my home university<br>it's from berkeley and it's lisa ellis<br>regalia<br>as lisa rightly said it looks very<br>medieval<br>and so it's quite fitting for this kind<br>of ritual and is the perfect metaphor<br>really for how i decided that this was<br>the only way i could handle this event<br>which is poking holes in it into it and<br>making sure i don't take myself too<br>seriously<br>so<br>okay so this is not a professor<br>and there will be a lot of find wally in<br>this lecture you know this is the easy<br>one i think you can easily find me in<br>these photos<br>but there will be some difficult uh<br>tests ahead of us so anyway let me tell<br>you though what this is going to be just<br>just to guide you in case i get lost i<br>tend to do that a lot<br>um<br>this is going to be a visual ipl<br>it will be both chronological and<br>anthological journey<br>but it will be broken with flash forward<br>and flashbacks will be interrupted<br>expanded and critique and poked<br>it will have in other words footnotes<br>which<br>many of us especially me thinks that<br>it's actually the most important thing<br>you should have in every in every<br>article or book you write but then of<br>course editors and peer reviewers think<br>is an audience and you just have to push<br>it somewhere else and so i got to<br>talk about my own footnotes<br>here so let me tell you now<br>about the title right the first thing<br>was okay this is not a piano explain<br>that now<br>lightness<br>um in this my journey to do to concert<br>likeness and open society will come back<br>the first one here is where things might<br>become serious and brian has already<br>mentioned<br>one of those events here is a<br>reimagining of the famous tank man photo<br>posted to the cinah weibo to commemorate<br>the june 4 1989 crackdown on student<br>protests in tiananmen square the image<br>was of course banned and removed from<br>the china net<br>humor is inherently democratic and<br>empowering and tyrants have no sense of<br>humor<br>lightness is a concept that i've<br>developed to describe and understand the<br>interstitial spaces of creative<br>practices that resist hegemonic cultural<br>economic and political value systems<br>they might be light but they make a<br>vital well that's what i think uh<br>contribution to the survival of open uh<br>societies and of course uh here is my<br>little summary just in case i get lost<br>you know the so lightness is<br>anti-conventional i can be playful and<br>irreverent but it's almost invaluably<br>ethically driven um it can be empowering<br>and enchanting especially in some of the<br>animation that i will show you uh and<br>invariably ask us to<br>include multiplicity rather than<br>focusing on the one right and accept<br>that there are encounters interstices<br>and chances that make the whole so like<br>cultural practices are everywhere but<br>they're not anchored to or endorsed by<br>any legitimate system of value now this<br>idea of legitimate culture is a<br>difficult one for me to to summarize um<br>i guess the way that i can i can<br>describe it is as a system in which<br>generally opposition are enclosed<br>and solidly built to mutually legitimize<br>each other binaries such like mainstream<br>and non-mainstream low brow versus<br>eyebrows popular in avant-garde dominant<br>lightness kind of doesn't fit in any of<br>that<br>does not quite create as i think<br>political design but in<br>nonetheless does create disturbance in<br>the dominant ideology and this is<br>particularly relevant for the chinese<br>context<br>where one experiences an openly invasive<br>presence of the state in the cultural<br>sphere<br>so<br>i suspect that at least the philosopher<br>here might have gotten the reference of<br>and his critique to totalitarianism and<br>what he considered totalitarian<br>philosophers<br>you probably know that he wrote this his<br>book you know the<br>open society and its enemy here in new<br>zealand he was an austrian jew who fled<br>hitler to escape nazi fascist europe<br>um<br>i loved karl popper and my knowledge of<br>copper is high school knowledge okay so<br>for those who<br>expect anything deeper than that but i i<br>loved it i love the fact that he was<br>subverting and dared to falsify the<br>uncontested truth about some of the key<br>philosopher i had been studying at the<br>time<br>so now you know what my ipl refers to<br>hopefully what comes next will explain<br>how lightness and open society have<br>become key concern of my research<br>but<br>i will become i will start with an<br>emotional her story of plural personal<br>belongings to map in fact<br>how<br>this italian woman ended up becoming a<br>scholar of china and i guess<br>uh of media and film<br>in delivering an ipl here in in athero<br>and it will be uh the story in four acts<br>will go from italy to china to the<br>states and<br>aotearoa<br>so here where i start da da ma you see i<br>got it i got the history right<br>um<br>the thing is i grew up speaking<br>possibly italian but only because my<br>dads and my mom's native dialects were<br>mutually unintelligible calabrese has<br>nothing to do with veneto<br>so i had a horrifying conservative<br>bordering fascist teacher in elementary<br>school it was all about memorization and<br>discipline<br>but i will not go that far back so i'm<br>not starting with uh so<br>i actually fast forward to 1980s 1980s<br>are you know really formative years for<br>me the years of school and this was a<br>time where italy was not quite yet out<br>of the honeydew of the<br>the years of lead as they were called<br>and those are some of the events that i<br>remember italy winning the football<br>world cup<br>and<br>the strategy bologna which was you know<br>really close to my heart into my<br>hometown and then the beginning of the<br>crack sierra and what that became one of<br>the you know most corrupted uh you know<br>period of a political of italian<br>sorry uh it was a letter on exposed<br>through the the judicial investigation<br>of manipulita but in all that i'd like<br>to point out to pertinee our president<br>an anti-fascist old man and a partisan<br>who was there at all of those occasions<br>that is where he just says<br>to the uh<br>reporters what do you want me to say<br>there is nothing to say after the<br>bombing of the terrorist bombing of the<br>bolognas<br>so here was when i started high school<br>and okay<br>so<br>i got you know my diploma of maturita<br>and now where is val waldo here or wally<br>that's me<br>um so in the italian curriculum all<br>subjects were compulsory you cannot just<br>select a few that you like<br>everything is framed was framed in<br>canon-based chronological anthological<br>structure the history of everything<br>incidentally this way of learning<br>makes it very easy to identify what to<br>falsify critique and poke holes in it so<br>the italian approach to knowledge it's<br>really a wonderful invitation you know<br>to be dissenting<br>but i was lucky enough to be accepted in<br>experimental school i don't know if you<br>can well i highlighted in english that<br>while he still had to work within the<br>structure okay<br>encourage us to really exploit<br>creatively the interests of italian<br>secondary education<br>regulations so we still need to do the<br>equivalent of ncaa the state exam so we<br>didn't escape that and that's my diploma<br>of maturita there but we were privileged<br>and we had to complete a huge<br>interdisciplinary project<br>that took forever to do<br>i chose the concept of truth as it had<br>been approaching the french theater<br>observed unesco<br>italian futurists palazzesque cardiac di<br>perella calvino castello de<br>desinigraciati shakespeare king lear and<br>of course karl popper and for latin<br>apollo and santa augustine and there was<br>math too i mean admittedly that was my<br>weakest point in the whole thing<br>so but when i say formative honestly<br>it's so true so this is the legeret's<br>idea the delightness comes really as i<br>encountered it for the first time as a<br>metaphor for freedom in palazzeski's<br>novel um spontaneity individuality are<br>two major component of his legenda his<br>provocative and irreverent perilous code<br>challenges conventions reject the poet<br>vate the nuncio kind of style and<br>instead propose the point as a clown as<br>an acrobat<br>and then of course i cannot mention<br>the love of my life without any doubt on<br>one of the writers that has most<br>influenced my own approach to knowledge<br>narrative and especially the<br>relationship between words and images<br>and here i'm just showing you my old<br>book with all my notes and i don't know<br>if you can see bellissimo with<br>exclamation points there<br>he was showing us multiple the multiple<br>paths that stories can take instead of<br>telling us<br>a single linear story okay so after all<br>that you thought okay she's going to do<br>philosophy or italian<br>at university those were indeed my<br>favorite subject surprise i did not<br>particularly like languages in high<br>school<br>but languages were the key to leave<br>italy for me and in fact i already used<br>it to go as an au pair in france and as<br>an au pair in england when i went in<br>high school so i wanted to study<br>something that would take me even<br>further from the familiar europe um so<br>i wanted to do lingua orientale that's<br>why they were called and the closest<br>university that would offer them was<br>venice<br>so<br>i could choose between hindi japanese or<br>chinese and i chose chinese because it<br>had the smallest number of students<br>i commuted every day to venice<br>it was four hours on the train<br>because my parents you know said you<br>can't go to venice we can't afford to<br>relocate you and then he said sure i can<br>commute and four hours on the train<br>every day is a fantastic way of spending<br>time read and studying it so that's all<br>i did for the next few years i studied<br>just china okay so this is there was no<br>other two major three majors minors in<br>italy it was just only china so chinese<br>history art whatever you may name it<br>including classical chinese and this is<br>one of the many things that took so much<br>of my life and so much time but never<br>did anything with it<br>but i never regret spending that time<br>uh so even my limited knowledge of<br>classical chinese that never led me<br>anywhere it was such a gift<br>incidentally<br>something else was going on in the<br>enterthesis of my university life when i<br>was not sweating over dwanza i was a<br>very very very very very very amateur<br>performer of comic theater uh but here<br>you know the reference to lightness is<br>it was a light group it was called the<br>puff this buffo which in italian makes<br>the pan also with buffalo which is humor<br>and among the three of us and like i<br>guess this is another of the easy find<br>wally thing right you can see which one<br>i am only one continued to be an actor<br>robbie became a serious doctor and i<br>went to china so here i<br>this is my china okay so it's<br>it's mostly uh hujin tao i guess the you<br>know kind of in between and now it is xi<br>jinping but when i went<br>um<br>china had just started economic reform<br>so<br>i want to go back just a step though to<br>see to show you the china that i<br>i don't have a lot of clips but this one<br>is<br>okay so can you read<br>that she's a peasant right and then she<br>but the party can take the child to look<br>after the child for a while<br>mama<br>actually i will bring the child to<br>university<br>that was my first joke don't don't<br>expect too many of these but this i<br>couldn't resist so what though i learned<br>at university in those three years was<br>really in<br>that hegemonic centralized in china was<br>clearly male dominated paradoxically a<br>society even more patriarchal than the<br>italian one that that i was so keen to<br>live<br>so that i know i knew as much of course<br>i knew about you know<br>maoism that was just around the corner<br>for us<br>but the china i met was about 10 years<br>later than the film clip that i showed<br>you um immediately i was exposed to<br>multiple like brian mentioned a lot of<br>other china not only multiple linguistic<br>identities people were speaking all sort<br>of different languages that had nothing<br>to do with putin hua with mandarin but<br>there were also all those other<br>foreigners embedded in in it that i did<br>not expect to find african students were<br>the majority of students at the uncyan i<br>did not expect to learn and discover so<br>much about our european neighboring<br>africa<br>in china<br>my friends were from morocco somalia<br>guinea<br>and egypt<br>i immediately realized that in fact this<br>was not one china and the detention<br>between what the chinese states claimed<br>as being<br>china political culturally<br>linguistically and what china really<br>meant for a multitude of people that<br>only partially or fully associated uh to<br>the idea or the imagined community of<br>china was a big gap<br>anyway i was supposed to be there only<br>for a couple of months but as what brian<br>didn't tell you that i revealed to him<br>um the reason why i stayed for an entire<br>year was that i was hired by the italian<br>chamber of commerce<br>because they were doing this you know<br>expo with leather and shoes and they<br>needed desperately somebody who could<br>translate from italian to chinese and<br>vice versa because they didn't speak<br>english so they hired me and my chinese<br>was like like so basic that it was not<br>really you know<br>i could i shouldn't i couldn't have done<br>i was this was my first you know<br>experiment as a total fraud and<br>continuing in that tradition so i was<br>translating very technical like you know<br>stuff about leather and<br>style of shoes with like oh this is very<br>good<br>so with very simple like you know at<br>this cost uh this is very expensive<br>right so this was 11 and then i would<br>repeat it more than once so just to fill<br>in the gaps<br>i was paid the exorbitant fee at the<br>time it was 1988 right of 200 us dollar<br>per day<br>so i worked i think less than a week<br>maybe five days and i made enough money<br>to pay for a whole year of studies in<br>beijing so i decided to stay i so<br>everybody else went back uh because this<br>you know was the trip organized by my<br>university and i stayed back and i just<br>stayed there and to learn more but then<br>of course in april things start to spin<br>and um<br>everyone<br>everyone seemed very excited that good<br>things were going to happen in china and<br>instead you know as you probably know um<br>the what is referred in china with just<br>two numbers leo right june 4th<br>happened later on but i told you lots of<br>flashback and and and flash forward in<br>my talk before that happened i was<br>really able to travel and and study um<br>and learn about this other china and<br>china in the 80s was huge of course but<br>you still had a human scale a rideable<br>scale not a cliche you could really ride<br>everywhere<br>automobiles were very few and as a<br>student now that i had a year-long<br>student visa i could actually live like<br>a chinese you know i could i could go to<br>the cheap place where foreigners were<br>not allowed because i could pay with the<br>chinese currency and my chinese<br>definitely had improved since you know<br>the the fraud time of the of the fair<br>and and i felt really safe i was<br>traveling by myself everywhere um and<br>just as i love the countryside the city<br>was absolutely exciting i loved the<br>people um in beijing there were cancer<br>political debates a cosmopolitan life<br>tuition that i can only describe as the<br>bruce springsting of chinese rock was<br>playing in small semi-private location<br>and we could all go see it<br>but anyway<br>back to where i was then there was the<br>big event these are my photos i mean i'm<br>sure you've seen much better ones um<br>i had no clue what was going on one<br>would bike for just an hour and a half<br>just to get to tiananmen square and end<br>up in the midst of chaos and you had no<br>idea really what was happening<br>only word of mouth and some mimiograph<br>that in fact i remember translating into<br>italian and sending back to italy<br>so i learned about what actually was<br>happening much later<br>and a thanks in fact documentary like<br>tiananmen the gate of heavenly pieces<br>produced<br>by richard gordon karma hinton and those<br>this is an audio clip of suijiang in the<br>square<br>and<br>so<br>after all that um everything was sad<br>scary confusing uncertain i went back to<br>italy this summer to take my fourth year<br>exams but i still wanted to go back to<br>china<br>um<br>no need to act as a translator as well<br>as an imposter anymore to make that<br>money i got a scholarship this time it<br>was a chinese government one china was<br>very keen for students to come back to<br>show that everything had gone back to<br>normal and so as brian already told you<br>i just chose the bfi<br>um<br>it just said open to foreign was such an<br>exciting project<br>here<br>i was only one of one ten foreigners and<br>we were given incredible amount of<br>freedom uh to access films<br>books everything um and we were given a<br>permission to study with chinese<br>students which was not common at the<br>time at the time students foreigners<br>were<br>kept strictly separated from chinese and<br>we were also given special class on<br>chinese history theory and aesthetics<br>and a couple of those two teachers i had<br>and i know brian would recognize them<br>and they later on became quite you know<br>known even in the english academia so<br>later on in 2006 in sydney at a<br>conference i even managed to meet dai<br>dai jin hua dai laushu there she had<br>become quite a star at the time and so i<br>was there and watching like hundreds of<br>chinese film every day and as as brian<br>already mentioned i was able to meet<br>some of the stars and he mentioned the<br>you know the more recent one but i<br>remember lilly lee you know one of the<br>old<br>um i thought this is not working doesn't<br>matter you can see you can see her both<br>you know in an older age and in her<br>younger look um<br>and then there was cedin seyjin is is a<br>is a legend is an institution in china<br>uh is one of those you know<br>filmmakers that really<br>has made chinese film history in in 1981<br>one of his 1964's film stage sister even<br>make it outside of china which was<br>unprecedented uh before<br>uh the fifth generation uh before that<br>kind of like this was much younger<br>shenkaga there you can see him like in<br>the back there and that is much much<br>older in in that talk that he gave on<br>yeah still on yellow earth so he was<br>becoming really the protagonist of this<br>new fifth generation of director that<br>were winning prizes at international<br>film festival so while those directors<br>and you know film stars and teachers<br>were important encounter<br>i think possibly even more important<br>were the lifelong friendships i<br>developed elizabeth and dominic<br>who actually are the reason why i speak<br>french<br>because they were from morial and and<br>then the<br>french was the lingua franca in fact<br>there was another french student and a<br>bulgarian who did not speak english so<br>we were when we were not speaking<br>chinese we were speaking fact french so<br>here you can see dominic elizabeth there<br>and soon lee jung and juchin siao those<br>friends later much much later on came to<br>visit me in in aotearoa<br>but i told you i was going to do some<br>flash forward um<br>those friends also helped me a great<br>deal<br>when i went back in 2005 for the first<br>time actually in 14 years<br>and to attend this conference now can<br>you find me in that photograph<br>this was the centennial celebration of<br>chinese cinema a big event organized<br>across two city beijing and shanghai it<br>started in beijing and then we had to<br>take actually a train to shanghai and i<br>remember paul clark being terrified that<br>he would be placed in the same place<br>with me and my kids<br>because yes i brought both of my kids<br>with me unfortunately both of them got<br>really sick when we were in china that<br>was not funny at all but um i thought<br>here is paul clark there is me can you<br>see me can you see me there okay wait<br>that gets even more funny<br>because here i am breastfeeding manu and<br>the guys you know just cover me while<br>i'm breastfeeding<br>do you did you see that that's like you<br>know this is like you know okay<br>and and ava on the other hand because<br>she was old enough so<br>at the time in china you could like get<br>free babysitting like post graduate<br>students were just you know part of<br>their duty was to free babysit also for<br>others so ava was taken around by a<br>postgraduate student there<br>so what was even more special on that<br>occasion was that my family and i don't<br>know if gemma is watching here um also<br>came to china at the time because i also<br>needed more substantial babysitting as i<br>would i got a you were urg and i had to<br>interview my documentarians gather my<br>material and somebody needed to be with<br>my kids<br>uh and they also took it of course as an<br>opportunity to visit china which was<br>fantastic so here i had my three world<br>um together my italian family my my<br>chinese friends and<br>my work it was incredible and they were<br>going around and like shift with the guy<br>holding manu there was the driver whom i<br>was like directing remotely through<br>phone because they didn't speak any<br>chinese so i was telling<br>him where to take them and there there<br>we are all together you know my my<br>family<br>and soon family and gemma's family<br>incidentally<br>um soon legend<br>became later on like this was my friend<br>like there were two students in the<br>scene in the animation department at the<br>beginning academy when was there it<br>became like this humongous business and<br>he became the president of china<br>animation institute of the belgian film<br>academy and now is the vice president of<br>beijing film academy you gotta have<br>important friends right<br>and that what allowed me to get access<br>to all these student animations then<br>later on was really crucial for me to<br>develop my research so anyway<br>i back to 1991 i graduated in bfi and<br>then i went back to italy to defend my<br>thesis remember i still hadn't finished<br>my undergraduate<br>so this was my thesis the myth of<br>stillness in chinese cinema<br>and that also changed my life because i<br>sent it to this competition<br>and i won third prize<br>it was a national competition with you<br>know on film studies thesis and the<br>first prize went to woody allen's cinema<br>thesis and the other one was on an<br>italian filmmaker and hadn't been for<br>what brian said the incredible series of<br>fortunate coincidence or events that<br>chinese cinema had become known to the<br>to the<br>broader public i don't think i would<br>have ever gotten the prize because i<br>don't think anybody bothered reading<br>these thesis that had like all this<br>complex argument hundreds of analysis of<br>cinema but they probably noticed in the<br>appendixes the famous people that i had<br>managed to interview and they thought<br>okay well it's you know 300 pages this<br>is let's you know let's reward it<br>so this is really is<br>a turning point for me um<br>because of this price this is what i'm<br>guessing and the fact that at the time<br>there were only two other books on<br>chinese cinema okay<br>so<br>the americans who love things that are<br>new right<br>decided i don't know how on earth really<br>to give me a fulbright and i'm of course<br>i had to apply for it you know it's just<br>they don't knock at your door but it was<br>a friend of mine who told me do you know<br>that there is this fulbright i was at<br>the time a secretary in a car radiator<br>factory and i just thought this was<br>going to be my life i wasn't planning on<br>being an academic and i just tried<br>and later on my now ex-husband told me<br>that my gre score was abysmal<br>and despite of this very larger his<br>score<br>i was accepted uh to do graduate work in<br>in in american university with this<br>football which isn't tremendous honor<br>and i really you know here i was in<br>georgetown with a bunch of other people<br>that really i thought they deserved to<br>be there much more than me i was<br>convinced they were gonna knock at the<br>door and say okay it was a mistake this<br>was not really for you<br>and i i went to iu and i started my<br>postgraduate studies<br>now<br>i have to jump at least 10 years now and<br>the reason i can do that is that you<br>know once you enter the black hole of<br>american graduate studies as dante would<br>say<br>abandon all hope you who enter<br>it takes forever to take to complete<br>postgraduate study in these days many of<br>you might know that graduate school<br>there<br>still requires to take classes and huge<br>exam even before you think about a<br>dissertation<br>a lot happened in those 10 years and<br>here's one in a film you would have you<br>know superimposed images and calendar<br>you know<br>and<br>i was learning how to write english i<br>got married<br>while i was learning how to write in<br>english i studied and taught<br>learning how to write in english i<br>worked for voice of america learning how<br>to write english my daughter was born<br>learning how to write english<br>this is when paradoxically my level of<br>chinese not only plateaued but in fact<br>began it's in an unstoppable decline<br>luckily for us foreign why chinese<br>people are incredibly kind and would<br>enthusiastically praise you every time<br>you utter anything in chinese so i have<br>not yet met a chinese person who doesn't<br>congratulate me for my wonderful chinese<br>even though is not good at all compared<br>to my english or my french for which i<br>so<br>while i was in the states i also<br>moved out of the italian sort of<br>anthological and you know canon based<br>of learning and i learned about the<br>wonders of theory<br>post-modern theory feminist critiques<br>which were completely unknown from<br>someone who had been trained in the old<br>school of synology i also discovered<br>topic based courses thematic approaches<br>seminar argumentative research and above<br>all comparative interdisciplinary<br>studies<br>so as i said i began to teach<br>americans they just say like you know i<br>like this sorry i'm this i shouldn't say<br>americans like that is very dismissed<br>but you know they really can take a lot<br>of that you're their postgraduate<br>students okay so they make them teach<br>they trust them with courses<br>um a course on race and ethnicity in the<br>media actually was a turning point i i<br>learned that i couldn't probably shoot<br>venture out of china as well<br>because the second asian language was<br>required for anyone doing a phd in<br>chinese and yes i went back also to<br>studying russian which i had studied as<br>an undergraduate but also seo zabila<br>it was a requirement also the graduate<br>school and knowledge of the third<br>non-asian language okay<br>big footnotes and this one i'm afraid<br>it's an important one an uncompromising<br>one<br>i know i might not win this battle but<br>it's still worth fighting it and today i<br>have a podium and so our leaders and i<br>can't believe i cannot believe david was<br>not supposed to be here and now he's<br>here so he can hear that as well<br>they'll have to listen it is the right<br>thing to do learning a language it is<br>the smart thing to do it's a useful<br>thing to do it's a vital thing to do<br>learning a language that is not your own<br>especially if your native language is<br>english is not an option is a must<br>my emphasis here is on learning not<br>fluency<br>reading the words of big philosophers<br>social activists political leaders<br>writers scientists economists of our<br>time in the original language matters it<br>takes time it is slow learning in which<br>the goal is actually never to become<br>expert but simply to learn in learning a<br>language there are no shortcuts<br>it takes time and humility you need to<br>have it because when you learn a<br>language you don't feel smart you're not<br>in control you're vulnerable<br>inadequate you're learning how to<br>pronounce and how to read and write<br>again but without that committed to<br>learning we are all still just children<br>of colonialism and it's cultural myopia<br>this is why when you want to approach a<br>culture you begin to enforce it english<br>only or mandarin only or italian only<br>right<br>this is why we are rightly starting to<br>push learning te reo here in aotearoa<br>but it should not be there or anyway i<br>could easily go on a dungeon but i have<br>i got time<br>i'm not even halfway through jessica<br>it's better that i move on<br>well anyway my thesis was in other<br>instances of me looking at in in the<br>interstices<br>chinese cinema as a field definitely was<br>growing but within it an uncharted area<br>was documentary and even in a more<br>embryonic space of digital and the web<br>my last two chapters focus on this topic<br>and then they became in fact what infor<br>my research later on in my first<br>publication<br>so i finished okay jumping into i i<br>applied for a couple of jobs that i<br>didn't get and including this like<br>chinese lecturer position at otago uh so<br>no spoiler here obviously i got the job<br>when i came to aotearoa the images i had<br>in my mind and what to expect came from<br>films like the piano which came out in<br>1993<br>and the whale rider who would just come<br>up come out the year before i arrived<br>but i knew very little of bicultural<br>terror okay<br>and<br>it was taikawati's boy<br>my name is boy<br>and welcome to my interesting world<br>okay<br>it was and remains one of the most<br>eye-opener film i've ever seen plus okay<br>i have to say thaika what it is the love<br>of my life<br>he doesn't know he doesn't know but<br>that's my you know teenager crush on him<br>well he'll never know<br>what he's missing moving on<br>so the key now for me was to localize<br>myself and in this bicultural context<br>and understanding it<br>um i started actually learning tarot<br>right away karen parinata was my first<br>teacher how lucky was i<br>um fortunately then i got pregnant and i<br>got kind of you know sidetracked by work<br>pressure so my tereo did not progress as<br>much as i wish he had but another way to<br>localize myself was develop new<br>collection new belongings both in my<br>teaching and in my research so brian<br>already<br>mentioned anza he was the one really who<br>introduced me it was my mentor it was my<br>my light in that sense<br>over the years the commitment to keep<br>this community and that asia alive has<br>really stuck with me<br>another answer<br>was to shift my focus effect on the<br>local chinese history and culture this<br>was also facilitated by the fact that<br>china itself as the center had been<br>questioned now by a lot of other<br>scholars and expanded to include<br>xenophon studies and transnational<br>diasporas this is how i discover for<br>instance rosandia a fantastic filmmaker<br>and by the way if you haven't seen her<br>work watch it have you seen cremery it's<br>like a<br>incredibly good sci-fi dystopian uh<br>series where the protagonists are<br>actually pan-asian women but it doesn't<br>really matter that they their ethnicity<br>in that constant doesn't matter anymore<br>anyway another way<br>for me<br>was to localize myself as a film and<br>media scholar in aotearoa so joining<br>fans and later was transformed in<br>sand which is the screen studies<br>association of australia and altera new<br>zealand was one of the ways and of<br>course key collaboration with my<br>colleagues in visual cultures and media<br>studies like with brett in the foreign<br>policy school but above all my leading<br>light in the dark<br>in the field of film theory my good<br>friend and colleague cassie fowler my<br>debt to kathy cannot be overstated she<br>has truly been a source of knowledge and<br>support allowing me not to feel as a<br>total imposter in the discipline with<br>within which my research is mostly<br>identified<br>you can see that i also added actually<br>yesterday a poster of kanga<br>this film i went yesterday today to the<br>screening because i was asked to<br>moderate the q a<br>and it was an incredible way also of of<br>localized asian experience in aotearoa<br>is specifically for grounding it with<br>the relation with tangata fenwa if you<br>haven't watched this film i mean it was<br>yesterday film festival i don't know if<br>it's gonna replay make sure you watch it<br>when it comes out it's the third in the<br>installation of the brown sugar apple<br>grand trilogy following uaru and um and<br>by if you have seen those water focus on<br>maori and violent pacifica and this one<br>on<br>on on pan asian uh women relations and<br>women stories<br>anyway zooming into otago and i'm sorry<br>i could not resist the lord of the rings<br>memes<br>so the institution otago okay so this<br>brian also already told you about how<br>this was<br>started i was part of a growing<br>languages and culture and a new newly<br>born chinese program<br>we had just been merged into one<br>department originally language<br>department railroy were separated in<br>individual unit spanish had hundreds of<br>students legend goals that we had as<br>many f's as law i don't know if it's<br>true<br>most of us were really new between 2003<br>and 2008 one chair was established and<br>at least eight new confirmation path<br>permanent position appointment were made<br>four in spanish two in chinese two in<br>japanese one in french and one in german<br>hai sin has<br>she's here she's here my wonderful<br>friend and<br>had pretty much created the chinese<br>program on her own and after my arrival<br>xiaohuan joined us only six months later<br>on the topic still of localizing<br>footnote okay<br>so<br>the story of institutional shift of<br>languages and culture would be too long<br>to tell<br>and we are not unique in having<br>experienced them many of us in other<br>departments and programs have been<br>through this fluctuation right now we<br>certainly don't have as many as law now<br>and had to face<br>suffer the unquestionable market<br>marketing approach to education this<br>we're told is university now it may<br>indeed be nonetheless we all need to<br>continue to question the unquestionable<br>proverb<br>has been appropriated and used to<br>celebrate our institution but its<br>meaning is far from being a true guiding<br>principle<br>over the years my new motto had been to<br>find ways to resist against the<br>inexorable push to turn us all into<br>roles function all dispensable and<br>replaceable<br>so i know i know tough decisions have to<br>be made but i thought this was my time<br>to just you know<br>put it out there and<br>the effort and the words still need to<br>be to be said<br>so<br>in jumping to today<br>i think the last thing i want to<br>cover in the context of localizing and<br>the emphasis on people that i just<br>introduced<br>is really the what we have been spending<br>with my<br>my colleagues and i time and energy for<br>the last six years so developing global<br>studies at otago this is another story<br>of finding and using the interstices<br>within our institution and its<br>established structures and regulations<br>which are inherently resistant with<br>their interdisciplinarity the most blood<br>mind-blocking one is for instance that<br>courses cannot be double coded<br>anyway i wish my appeal could be<br>dedicated to this program uh to tell you<br>more about this program which really<br>translates the anti-conventional<br>ethically driven inclusive value of<br>multiplicity into<br>creative critically thinking ethically<br>minding culturally and linguistically<br>literally and actively engaged global<br>citizens i wish you could meet some of<br>our students they're really fantastic<br>but i need to move on and i think it's<br>time now that i tell you a little bit<br>more about how all this relates to my<br>research right um i from this would not<br>be as long<br>um<br>so the first thing is really connecting<br>lightness to the moving images<br>here i guess that i have to pay homage<br>to tom gunning and his definition of the<br>exhibitionist quality of the the movies<br>that i wanted to examine and that he in<br>his famous article on the early cinema<br>attraction declared as being a<br>distinctive characteristic of the very<br>first film showing he argued that<br>although the history of cinema is<br>dominated by narrative film in its<br>earlier<br>years films were more concerned with<br>displaying their ability to show<br>something rather than creating<br>self-sufficient narrative word upon<br>screen you can see the connection with<br>calvino's visual mode of expression here<br>and how it intersects with the idea of<br>attraction and exhibitionism just as in<br>the castle of cross destiny each<br>character was showing<br>the multiple possibility of stories<br>rather than telling the story i argue<br>that in movies as well<br>images and words can be used<br>verbally in order to say something or<br>visually in order to show something and<br>that filmmakers make a fundamental<br>choice between offering explanation and<br>telling you with enclosed narrative what<br>the story is about or adding<br>complications opening up their work to<br>multiple interpretation creating filming<br>reality filmic reality as something to<br>show<br>okay uh so i<br>i move now to<br>what in film i focused on and you<br>guessed it already i moved away from<br>feature film and i went to more<br>specifically to look for this<br>exhibitionist quality in an area like<br>documentary animation in either hybrid<br>form<br>i have one<br>a very different type of woman compared<br>to the one who can read and write right<br>and is embedded into a narrative<br>um this actually it's a 1930s old uh<br>rangling film channel the goddess<br>but that's exactly the type of visual<br>conjectures that i was trying to<br>to<br>trace in documentary filmmaking<br>um i moved into<br>two area the first one is really china<br>center so very much visual conjectures<br>within china and the second one which is<br>the one that i developed later on was<br>looking into documentary as trans media<br>and transnational accented storytelling<br>so<br>i told you i i started writing on<br>documentary and i told you that karma<br>hinton and richard gordon the two<br>producers of gay the gate um<br>of heavenly peace tiananmen would come<br>back as you can see once again a series<br>of fortuitous events that led me to to<br>know them and to meet them and they<br>allowed me access to a bunch of material<br>that you know really allowed me to<br>explore chinese documentary and i thank<br>them in this particular article so the<br>the chinese documentary i was i was<br>interested in in analyzing was again the<br>documentary of the interstices the<br>periphery of the chinese avant-garde you<br>can see dai jin hua there and these are<br>you know students performing in pian um<br>the other bank actually gaussian one of<br>the two nobel prize<br>writers in china<br>or<br>a different type of of performance this<br>one is<br>oh<br>or the periphery of of the city in which<br>the flow china's floating population<br>live these are the internal migrants<br>that<br>or china's improper youth<br>so not the you know healthy and bright<br>communist<br>heroes but drug addicts<br>this is juvede by dalyan<br>or queer china that was really<br>just barely emerging area and sweden<br>and the director again i met him at the<br>here the periphery of history<br>remembering recordings china's forgotten<br>past<br>uh this is the story of uh<br>bien jung<br>the first teacher who was beaten to<br>death by the red guards in beijing<br>during the cultural revolution recorded<br>so<br>documentary moved online it became<br>digital it became really the domain of<br>the ordinary people so the filmmakers<br>became themselves um and i<br>i i looked and watched this with a with<br>a lot of hope<br>but unfortunately in a way the more<br>documentary was exploring those other<br>space in china and the more xi jinping's<br>china in fact was homogenizing and<br>centralizing the discourse so what<br>became very interesting for me was that<br>the other stories about china<br>were told increasingly outside of china<br>what i mean they were about china but<br>they were uh<br>oftentimes made by you know filmmakers<br>that were not<br>uh living in china they were visiting<br>china or where where where access in<br>china from the outside or we're not even<br>chinese like italian filmmakers as well<br>not um<br>along the tradition of antonioni and<br>here is where i use the concept of<br>accent<br>um<br>increasingly what i like to explore is<br>an accented china china that is made yes<br>by chinese people but also by all sort<br>and those are just some images from that<br>remember at the beginning i showed you<br>um<br>magritte right this this is actually<br>the village tafen village in shenzhen<br>where we we went and visited there it<br>really there is a place where copy<br>painters reproduce all sort of you know<br>famous painting in and and then for the<br>global market and so<br>but the photo on the right is my own<br>photo and the other is from the film<br>so<br>finally i guess uh it is about other<br>hybrid form of<br>of of film and in this case they are not<br>quite documentary they are all sort of<br>different type of film um<br>again<br>the the the type of film i i<br>call small screen realities uh are films<br>that have very<br>weight they are low budget uh they are<br>too volatile to ask a piece to row too<br>small<br>to warrant film scholars attention and<br>my proposition was that we should indeed<br>pay attention to them and i guess<br>i was lucky<br>because<br>my proposition was endorsed by my peers<br>and suddenly i found myself invited to<br>key sanctuaries of chinese contemporary<br>studies from berkeley to nyu goldsmith<br>college in chicago<br>but<br>this kind of films were very hard for me<br>to capture in one single<br>even broader label<br>so<br>certainly not<br>a film or even a micro cinema film not a<br>documentary what is this<br>um<br>i guess that here i add to my early<br>source of inspiration palazzeski and<br>calvino lightness here really echoes<br>milan's condor association between the<br>multiplicity of insignificant event and<br>their deep meaning in defining human<br>existence so in our contemporary social<br>and cultural space we i guess relently<br>see this kind of videos we cross paths<br>with them we're both attracted and<br>distracted by them and but we don't<br>really pay attention to them as we don't<br>recognize their meaningful<br>attractiveness but is not an event in<br>fact more significant and not worthy the<br>greater the number of fortuities<br>necessary to bring it about chance and<br>chance alone has a message for us<br>so this this what it was accidental<br>journalism video amateur author micro<br>cinema some<br>web spoof and a lot of light animation<br>those were the animation i collected<br>when<br>i went back in 2005 and then continue to<br>interest me even to today so<br>i end with animation this is what i'm<br>working currently on it's not again this<br>kind of animation<br>it's it's it's a light animation it's an<br>inhabits the space of enchantment<br>and once again i'm interested in those<br>interstitial practices and<br>unconventional and enchanting<br>here it's about our ability to be<br>enchanted by our everyday life with an<br>experience of the modern and the<br>post-modern world that emphasize<br>multiple connections rather than<br>separation opposition between technology<br>and magic observation and imagination<br>science and art knowledge and pleasure<br>and here is jade i quote from jane<br>bennett without modes of enchantment we<br>might not have the energy and<br>inspiration to enact ecological projects<br>or to context ugly and unjust modes of<br>commercialization or to respond<br>generously to human and non-humans the<br>challenge our subtle identities<br>okay i have just one clip here to show<br>you<br>so<br>so here is where i try to really i<br>coined the term animator trying to<br>capture you know the their<br>non-institutional and unofficial<br>location defined by both amateur and<br>artisan quality a light type of<br>authorship the challenges complicates<br>and expands the scholarly discourse on<br>the moving image<br>they're light again as i said but they<br>are handmade and they are embodied and<br>they really<br>needs to be reconnected to earlier<br>practices such the uh<br>performance of of of of um<br>shadow plays but even earlier than that<br>the idea of pictures for use and<br>pleasure<br>the vernacular that goes back to the<br>idea that there is a space for anonymity<br>forgery duplication and flag<br>fluctuating locations<br>so this is my animator right um is i<br>call it post digital not this is not my<br>term a term that really is very useful<br>even if it sucks in certain ways and<br>everything that pause right um because<br>it recenters being human in a digital<br>world you know to to be<br>not just defined by technology but in<br>fact to own it to to to re-center as i<br>said the human in and localizing its<br>agency in this technological world and<br>so these are some images from my<br>animator<br>finally this light enchanting attractive<br>animation has also a very complex<br>relationship with the state promoted<br>soft power brian mentioned<br>edited that volume in which my<br>colleagues lohui and i have challenged<br>this idea of soft power and my own<br>contribution<br>so you can focus on the animation<br>themselves<br>so<br>this kind of animation has really as i<br>said a complex relationship with the<br>state promoter soft powers supported by<br>commission<br>uh by<br>the state and and sometimes also<br>promoted by spontaneous nationalist and<br>patriotic animation<br>so what we what we think is that culture<br>and chinese online screen culture in<br>particular cannot be simply assessed as<br>either succeeding or failing to promote<br>china soft power this kind of animation<br>might have very little to do with the<br>wondrous but unruly power of um<br>attracting animation<br>yet while does it might not get what you<br>want in world politics and is therefore<br>an inadequate tool for developing or<br>measuring soft power the attraction what<br>i call the light power of this animation<br>is a vital inventive creativity that may<br>not be what chinese leaders want but is<br>in fact what chinese culture needs<br>okay<br>i'm moving now towards the end you guys<br>are almost made it what truly matters<br>okay<br>i cannot pretend i did not want to<br>become a professor and this has just<br>happened to me right<br>i'm here in fact because endorsement<br>giving legitimate you know institution<br>and the legitimate experts have<br>validated my work you know doing<br>precisely what i think you know we<br>shouldn't be doing<br>and yet<br>it was what happened in the intros<br>thesis what goes often and seen and<br>recognized what i<br>in fact i could not put in my promotion<br>application that matters the most<br>slow learning hard work<br>interdisciplinary encounters chances and<br>most importantly the motivation and the<br>strength<br>that i found in the people i met i<br>worked and lived with not institutional<br>roles or student acts but really<br>embodied communities and family<br>hoppori and whanau<br>so<br>and<br>in my application for promotion guys i<br>have to take i had to tick a box in<br>which i actually had to declare i was<br>outstanding and that's you know the word<br>has been used kid you not i barely stand<br>out i'm a very short woman<br>in ending this known ipl i want to<br>acknowledge instead many many people a<br>lot of<br>extraordinary teachers colleagues<br>friends and family whose shoulder indeed<br>i'm truly standing on<br>so here are my wonderful colleagues in<br>languages and cultures i try to find<br>photos where all of you could be<br>captured i<br>couldn't but there are some people who<br>are no longer with that did you see<br>kelly there linda right<br>and of course their students<br>as i said<br>wonderful students these are our<br>global studies students sandra sophie<br>there you can see<br>i wish i could mention them all<br>and there are<br>more than friends my whanau my friend<br>julia gotham and emilio<br>mar where would i be without you really<br>honestly<br>and linda and neil<br>more than than family friends part of my<br>family<br>kathy you looked after my kids in so<br>many ways i can't even count them<br>and<br>fafete<br>and lina my we are here at the youtube<br>concert i don't know if you can<br>we went together<br>and grazia erica and arigato toki she's<br>in manchester now<br>um<br>thank you philippe and ellen<br>and yes thank you andy<br>and gratia gemma nico fausta anita and<br>wally<br>and the best for last<br>my wonderful kids ava and mano you<br>really are all that matters and winnipeg<br>and that i could do your last where is<br>wally<br>in that photo<br>i think you can probably see me there<br>but here is where i am and i hope i'm<br>not gonna cry<br>one of the reasons this ipl turned into<br>a trip in memory lane and you can guess<br>how long it took me to find all the<br>visual material evidence pieces of this<br>puzzle<br>is that i'm feeling right now a great<br>sense of loss and wanted to regain a<br>sense of presence<br>so i'm ending by celebrating this moment<br>with you mama papa francais sergio<br>my dad never quite understood what was i<br>doing and my mom actually<br>imagined that my everyday work<br>was an ipl<br>that i was a learned professorisa at<br>universita and then i wouldn't pass<br>knowledge<br>from a podium to a big audience of<br>cheering students<br>possibly not dressed in this medieval<br>regalia but you know in an elegant<br>italian style<br>if they were here my papa would probably<br>say cuz salute which is in calabrese<br>and my mom would be proud that i'm<br>wearing<br>everything that she got me she made this<br>for me this was the last nice sweater<br>she got me<br>they would not quite understand that i'm<br>here because my work was validated by<br>legitimate expert was cited by other<br>scholars had a so-called impact in my<br>field and all the other leadership<br>achievement in teaching they actually<br>belonged to the generation in which<br>what students thought about their<br>teacher was totally irrelevant and the<br>idea that i would even want to create an<br>interdisciplinary program like global<br>studies would be incomprehensible to<br>them<br>but i know that they were proud that i<br>did whatever i did and they were so<br>impressed that i was doing it in english<br>they actually were that i was teaching<br>chinese and raising two children on my<br>own and that i made sure that they would<br>speak italian and they would spend time<br>in italy with their family and they<br>would know their roots<br>my mom and dad would have probably liked<br>this event<br>even more if there were some sort of<br>oscar statue<br>or a medal<br>which you guys<br>didn't give me<br>they could now talk<br>and hold and they would have certainly<br>appreciated the tribute to hopori and<br>whanau possibly they would have<br>preferred that i read out loud the names<br>to make sure i didn't forget anyone like<br>for instance all my aunties and uncles<br>that were not mentioned<br>and of course this really needed for<br>them some sort of wrapping up music at<br>in an earlier version of this iphone<br>that i rehearsed multiple times i wanted<br>to end by singing poetro which i had<br>translated in chinese for one of my<br>classes for a moon festival and i had<br>italian as well already<br>but every time i started poor hotel i<br>started crying<br>and choked up even just saying that word<br>so instead of giving you this very<br>i i'm ending with a smile<br>and one more lord of the rings mems and<br>that's for you ava<br>it's over<br>it's done mr frodo<br>and of course i went over time<br>so typical of me<br>i overthink i overdo i over share my son<br>often says to me that i think take<br>things<br>especially work too intensely that i<br>should lighten up<br>considering the insane amount of time<br>spent preparing this and the<br>unbelievable anxiety<br>up until four o'clock in the morning<br>yesterday that i experienced i have to<br>agree with him<br>you're right mano i should lighten up<br>ko o<br>e<br>i hope you don't feel it i've wasted an<br>thank you<br>i'm<br>so i am um the current pvc humanities<br>but it's a great pleasure actually to<br>have been a part of this evening<br>speaking with one of the past humanities<br>pvc so brian thank you so much for being<br>involved and for your lovely words for<br>paola to introduce her so my role is to<br>give a short vote of thanks particularly<br>short given<br>why did i bother writing anything i knew<br>it was going to happen<br>um but i do want to say it was wonderful<br>and we really appreciated it and um i i<br>think paula that your work demonstrates<br>one of the strengths of the humanities<br>scholars and that is that you challenge<br>us to see greater truths and the deeper<br>mysteries behind things that might<br>otherwise appear to be self-evident and<br>that you point out things that we might<br>otherwise miss because of the kind of<br>easy or orthodox classification of our<br>lives and and i think you mentioned<br>cultural economic and political systems<br>and life is far brighter because of the<br>kind of work that you do and far more<br>interesting and particularly in your<br>case certainly more humorous so thank<br>you so much<br>we really appreciate it<br>you<br>you started with this as not an ipl<br>and that's the one piece that i do want<br>to say i disagree with you on i think<br>this was a superb ipl<br>and i think what you did was what we<br>would hope that every ipl would do and<br>that is that you enabled us<br>to learn more about a whole lot of other<br>disciplines that you spend your daily<br>research and teaching in and you showed<br>us several different research methods as<br>well but you did all of that<br>and still by telling us the personal<br>story of your life and what it is that<br>makes you want to be here and do the job<br>that you do<br>so you talk to us about<br>about the charge to see multiple<br>meanings in what we do and see and you<br>demonstrated that beautifully for us so<br>there were layers of multiple meanings<br>there for you<br>but also there were layers of multiple<br>meanings for us so this ipl gives us as<br>an institution the chance to recognize<br>you<br>but it also gives<br>your colleagues here a chance to<br>recognize and acknowledge you and and<br>thank you for who you are as a colleague<br>it gives many of us in the audience who<br>are friends of yours a greater insight<br>into what goes on in paula's head and i<br>think for two here in particular it<br>gives them a chance to recognise and<br>appreciate the wonderful mother that you<br>are and the depth of their mothering so<br>bravo the lissimo it was wonderful<br>so thank you thank you for giving us<br>that opportunity and i also want to just<br>comment and say<br>thank you for choosing also to speak<br>bravely to the institution that you're<br>in as a part of that ipl that's exactly<br>what you should do<br>so bravo you questioned what some might<br>think is the unquestionable and what<br>certainly david and i hope is not and<br>you poked and so you should so please do<br>so<br>na mahinui mo tamahi<br>koredo tinepo<br>me fakamihi ahorangi<br>paola voci<br>tinakwe i have the great pleasure of<br>presenting you something<br>but it is nevertheless a wee gift<br>to recognise your achievement and to say<br>well done<br>and last last but not least a huge thank<br>you to all of you for coming for giving<br>of your time and i'm sure like me you<br>would say that was not time wasted at<br>all it was a fascinating evening so<br>thank you all for coming and for showing<br>your appreciation to paula<br>come and join us hide in my uh more te<br>kaputi mortakai morte uh<br>over at the staff club we've
