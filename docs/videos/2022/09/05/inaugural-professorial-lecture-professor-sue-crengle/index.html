and it's it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you all here today<br>for the celebration of sue kringle's<br>promotion<br>to professor<br>it's one of my the great pleasures of of<br>my job to be part of<br>these events and as you may know we've<br>had quite a disruptive program of<br>inaugural professorial lectures over the<br>past<br>two to three years and it's great to be<br>on on track again and i think for sue<br>it's after about<br>three or four um delays we've managed to<br>get here on the inside it's a really<br>wonderful suit to be here<br>my<br>main role is to welcome you all and<br>i do want to give a big warm welcome to<br>everyone who's here today<br>everyone who's here online and<br>either watching it live or watching it<br>later on<br>um big big welcome those of the in the<br>wider university community<br>um<br>those from the wider dunedin community<br>senior colleagues but especially uh to<br>sue's<br>whanau and friends and i do believe we<br>have some special guests in the in the<br>audience today i think we have sue's<br>mother jenny<br>uh<br>uncle royd<br>aunty<br>shona and auntie pam<br>and big big welcome to you all and i<br>know there are many many others who have<br>supported um sue throughout her career<br>who'll be watching<br>this<br>presentation today<br>i will be very shortly handing over to<br>emma white to give a more uh detailed<br>introduction to sue's career<br>but i do want to say<br>have a few personal words for a start<br>because i've known known of sue for many<br>years but only in the last few years<br>have we actually got to know each other<br>and that's through<br>largely through the covert era we've<br>been on a number of committees together<br>and largely met via zoom<br>but it has been a real privilege for me<br>to work with sue<br>and i've learned a few things<br>about sue that i thought i'd just share<br>before passing over to emma and<br>with sue we have someone whose<br>expertise is highly sought after and<br>highly valued<br>someone who is always measured and<br>direct in her opinions and never afraid<br>to speak up and i think we know what i<br>mean<br>someone who is utterly committed to<br>maori health equity<br>and to address inequities and health<br>status and health outcomes<br>and whose humble nature belies a hugely<br>impressive cv<br>and<br>that's measured on by taken by any<br>measure<br>reveals remarkable productivity across<br>teaching research and service activities<br>um and i guess we'll hear some of that<br>maybe from ameren certainly from from<br>subut<br>i certainly want to mention about sue's<br>more recent role i've been on the<br>inaugural board of uh<br>the new maori health authority and i<br>think that's an absolute testament<br>to sus mana i am really huge<br>to you for that<br>so you've really left a large legacy<br>and um and i can't help be reminded of<br>the the point in naitah whakatauki<br>for us and our children after us<br>and so congratulations on this<br>really well deserved promotion<br>and i'm very much looking forward to<br>hearing your lecture and i will pass<br>over to emma sanoreva tena koto tenna<br>koto tena koto<br>so as david says<br>sid it's my great pleasure to introduce<br>my good friend and dear colleague this<br>evening to deliver her inaugural<br>professorial lecture<br>and i'm not actually going to talk about<br>sue's career because she's had an<br>amazing career and<br>we couldn't capture it all here tonight<br>in just a few minutes so i'm going to<br>talk about sue<br>and um a little story that i think<br>resonates with who is and what she does<br>so as some of you already know and the<br>rest of you will shortly learn that<br>professor sue kringle is deeply<br>passionate about the health and<br>wellbeing of new zealanders and of<br>course in particular maori<br>as such she's a leading researcher and<br>teacher of some of the multiple health<br>inequities that maori individuals whanau<br>and communities bear the burden of<br>and of course the solutions to such<br>challenges<br>crucially sue is a politically engaged<br>intellectual and as a known face on our<br>many kaitehu<br>especially at her beloved odaka aparima<br>she definitely isn't one who remains and<br>sconced in the ivory tower<br>sue was raised in zika al-mawi in<br>wellington and auckland and completed<br>her medical degree at that other<br>university<br>but by disposition in whakapapa and now<br>geography she's very much of the south<br>and if my marriage has taught me<br>anything<br>it's that with latitude comes attitude<br>and so very much embodies that<br>so i was reminded of this more recently<br>while reading through volume 2 of<br>tangents and later<br>the people of naitahu<br>in particular the biography of hida<br>munro nae sterling<br>hiro was born at waimatuku in the mid<br>1870s she was the porter key of a whanau<br>of six<br>he'd have spent chunks of her childhood<br>at bluff and up on the upper emo native<br>reserve<br>an active member of the salvation army<br>from the age of 16<br>a noted singer hit a tour to ike maui<br>new south wales and victoria as a<br>salvationist<br>she later joined the anglican church<br>undertaking mission and teaching work in<br>the whanganui river<br>river in the hawke's bay and at hindi<br>musu in rotorua<br>along the way hira collaborated with the<br>nascent young maori party that emerged<br>from within tiate college<br>and was primarily focused on improving<br>maori health<br>as an extension of this she was a<br>staunch prohibition<br>prohibitioist<br>and key marine member of the women's<br>christian temperance union along with my<br>great grandmother's sister panitito<br>whose father the long-serving southern<br>maori mp tami paratha was a pivotal<br>figure in shaping maori health policy<br>nationally<br>hiro was also happy to publicly call out<br>male kaitou leaders<br>not saying anything here so she doesn't<br>that she disagreed with as occurred at<br>suahiwe in 1925.<br>now i'm not suggesting that sue has<br>consciously modelled herself on people<br>like hitter but i'm pretty sure we won't<br>be treated to a solo soprano performance<br>tonight for example<br>but feel free to prove me wrong<br>notwithstanding it seems to me that<br>there are several parallels between<br>these two remarkable southern kaitou<br>women<br>so like hira has risen to prominence<br>within national organizations committed<br>to enhancing maori health<br>su la keda has collaborated with hapu in<br>places beyond tiwa ponemo and across te<br>ikawa maui but in doing so and doing all<br>of these things sue's talents and values<br>as with hira earlier are i think shaped<br>hugely by her kaiserhu<br>and lifelong connections to our<br>resilient whanau at uraka in aparima<br>and if we look at the final photo in<br>hira's biography in tangasu too we find<br>her in her later years in about 1945<br>at oraca visiting her good friend and<br>funoka ahinata kaitai clever<br>and ahinata's mokopuna raina kringle<br>raina is sue's aunt her father's older<br>sister<br>now in her 90s in invercargill and raina<br>had hoped to join us all here this<br>evening but i know she will be thinking<br>of you soon<br>and i've no doubt you're all thinking of<br>your dad brian tonight he would have<br>been very very proud of you<br>and your many achievements<br>over your lifetime<br>so to conclude this introduction let me<br>say that in the long history of our ewe<br>i'm quite confident that one one day in<br>the very distant future hopefully a<br>biography of professor sue kringle will<br>sit alongside people like hida munro in<br>a future volume of tangasang otahu<br>continuing to inspire our future<br>generations<br>but tonight it is us who will be<br>inspired<br>so without further ado<br>the floor is yours<br>and in the photo on the left is tetakuta<br>otiti<br>which is<br>across the road from tiara kiwa or fovo<br>strait<br>and<br>it's an oracal kolak bay which is where<br>dad grew up and<br>and his whanau grew up<br>and the building was the kolak base<br>school<br>before the roonaka perched it purchased<br>it at full market rates in 1996 when it<br>had been declared surplus to crown needs<br>mum grew up in ototo<br>and has ancestral connections to germany<br>scotland<br>ireland and england<br>dad left home and joined the navy when<br>he had just turned 16.<br>and mum met him through his sister anne<br>when they were at teachers college<br>together and<br>she moved to auckland to be with him<br>after she had finished teachers college<br>growing up we moved between auckland and<br>wellington living in puerido austin and<br>tetahi bay in wellington and in belmont<br>and it's my first year at mid school<br>i'm the one in the center<br>and behind me my very good mates still<br>lifelong mates<br>david tiffany leach and paparangi reed<br>and wendy walker as a pediatrician in<br>auckland she's on the left and ted<br>hughes as an anesthetist<br>i was a polynesian preference<br>scam admission to medical school which<br>these days is called the martian pacific<br>mission scheme<br>and in my year there were six of us four<br>maori and two people with pacific<br>whakapapa<br>the photo on the right are the group<br>that were my buddies and flatmates<br>through medical school<br>and<br>i'm really<br>honored to have sarah here tonight<br>and that photo was taken in dunedin<br>in bluff in december last year we'd<br>arranged that we're all going to have a<br>get together for my ipl in december um<br>and then decided that we'd carry on with<br>our get-together anyway<br>i spent five years working in a hospital<br>and then at the beginning of 1991<br>went moved into general practice and<br>worked in<br>a mainstream practice in west auckland<br>there were a set of health reforms that<br>were announced in 1991 and then enacted<br>in 1992<br>and those health reforms really allowed<br>maori organizations to enter the health<br>sector as providers of healthcare for<br>the first time<br>and one of the organizations that did<br>that was to whanau apareida trust which<br>is a large urban maori authority in west<br>auckland<br>and i moved there and alongside marion<br>hakodaya who is<br>the woman<br>in the white shirt<br>nikki turner and myself set up the<br>health services that waipa data provided<br>the local gps weren't particularly happy<br>with the idea<br>but there was one<br>local gp who took us under our wins we<br>were so green i'd done 18 months general<br>practice perhaps nikki had<br>arrived back in the country from working<br>in namibia<br>and so<br>peter wilford took us under his wing<br>and really supported us and<br>continues to be a very dear friend<br>and i'm very grateful he's here as well<br>i believe in it<br>oh peter yeah and i'm very i'm delighted<br>and thrilled to have you here too peter<br>i started getting my gp qualifications<br>while i was working at waipa data and as<br>part of that<br>we had to do<br>video consultations and we got feedback<br>on the video consultations and nikki got<br>some feedback about one of her<br>consultations and was told that she was<br>sexually inappropriate<br>and she had<br>kissed akuya<br>and welcome as the courier came into the<br>consultation room<br>she was bit perturbed and i was kind of<br>outraged<br>um<br>and<br>the board of the college at the time was<br>having a meeting in auckland and there<br>was an open invitation to go along and<br>to see them<br>and so off i trot and i expressed my<br>displeasure i don't think it made much<br>difference<br>but not long afterwards i was on the<br>board of the auckland faculty of the<br>college and that was my first foray into<br>the college of general practitioners i<br>also started my masters of public health<br>at that time<br>and in 1997 i moved to the university<br>part-time with an hrc research training<br>fellowship to finish my master's thesis<br>and then went on to do public health<br>medicine training<br>in 1999 i was awarded a heartless<br>fellowship and went to johns hopkins in<br>baltimore<br>and when i came home i spent<br>a year working in the national health<br>committee secretariat and the ministry<br>of health to see if i wanted to be a<br>bureaucrat<br>and i returned to the university at the<br>and then i went to work in funding and<br>planning at waitamata in auckland dhbs<br>in 2012. and we<br>and started to do clinical general<br>practice again at turkey<br>health services which is a large mighty<br>health provider in south auckland<br>moved home in october 2014<br>and started here at the university of<br>so<br>um i want to acknowledge mina jackson<br>who was the first person that i heard<br>talking about myth takes<br>and his intellect generosity and<br>kindness is very sorely missed<br>so there are three related myth takes<br>about maori and health research<br>we're reluctant to participate in<br>research we're difficult to recruit to<br>research and we're difficult to retain<br>and projects<br>i want to demonstrate that these are<br>indeed myth takes and highlight what's<br>required to ensure that we want to<br>participate and stay involved with<br>projects once we do engage in them and<br>i'm going to use four projects to do<br>this<br>so the first project was and was<br>entitled are the ethnic iniquities and<br>the management of children's asthma<br>during my mph i'd become aware that<br>there were some inequities in the<br>management of asthma and and we were<br>over represented in hospitalizations and<br>mortality<br>but the studies were quite old they'd<br>been done in the 80s and maybe the early<br>90s very few of them focused on children<br>and they were largely<br>focused on people who were admitted to<br>hospital<br>i want to first acknowledge ana sasha<br>who's on the left she's a professor of<br>paediatrics and respiratory paediatrics<br>and when i first had this idea<br>i went along to her and she was so<br>supportive she was incredibly supportive<br>and she gave me an old grant application<br>of hers and said use this as a template<br>for how to write a grant application<br>because i've never written one before<br>and i truly believe that without that<br>template my application wouldn't have<br>been successful<br>and actually throughout in all the<br>subsequent years whenever i've seen and<br>she's always been incredibly supportive<br>and she's a remarkable woman<br>i want to also acknowledge colin<br>tupertonga and cameron um<br>grant thank you<br>and elizabeth robinson who were on the<br>research project with me and mavis<br>roberts and binkytawa were the<br>research managers<br>and ran the team research team<br>um<br>and<br>i start we started data collecting in<br>may 1999 and in july i kind of wandered<br>off to baltimore for a year<br>and so was a way for a full year of the<br>two years of data collection and without<br>mavis and binky and colin and cameron's<br>supervision<br>i don't think the project would have got<br>completed<br>so what we did in this study was we used<br>a community-based sample of the<br>caregivers of children aged 2 to 14 who<br>had a diagnosis of asthma and had had<br>asthma symptoms in the previous 12<br>months<br>we identified these people we got a list<br>of random residential addresses from<br>stats new zealand and someone adore went<br>out and knocked on the door and said<br>hello<br>we're looking to do the study do you<br>have any children with asthma living in<br>your house and we did that for the 10<br>houses from that address<br>we used equal explanatory power so we<br>had 170 caregivers in the maori pacific<br>and other ethnic groups<br>and because the other population is<br>bigger and therefore has more children<br>with asthma<br>and we wanted the interviews to all<br>finish at the same time we used what's<br>called a sampling ratio<br>so for the<br>other and the maori groups<br>not everyone who said that they were<br>interested in participating was actually<br>enrolled into the study<br>and that's called a sampling ratio<br>more about that later<br>we had a questionnaire which asked a<br>whole lot of questions including things<br>about the child's asthma symptoms their<br>use of health services because of asthma<br>what asthma education they'd been given<br>and what asthma medications the child<br>was given<br>we had a really high response rate with<br>over 92 of the maori caregivers 88 of<br>the pacific caregivers and um 89 of the<br>other caregivers who were enrolled into<br>the study completing<br>it um some of the key findings were that<br>for maori and pacific children they had<br>higher morbidity or asthma symptoms<br>particularly severe asthma symptoms<br>almost all of the children had a regular<br>gp that they went to for asthma care<br>the martian pacific children had<br>significantly higher gp visits for both<br>acute and routine asthma care and also<br>had higher use of emergency departments<br>there were significant differences in<br>their caregivers experience of asthma<br>education and the maori and pacific<br>caregivers reported that they were less<br>likely to get practical demonstrations<br>so for example how to showing how to use<br>inhalers<br>they had less information about<br>pathophysiology which is the things that<br>cause the asthma symptoms asthma<br>triggers and action plans and a smaller<br>percentage reported that the education<br>they received was clear and easy to<br>understand and as a result<br>their asthma knowledge their knowledge<br>about asthma symptoms and triggers and<br>general asthma knowledge was lower than<br>the other caregivers<br>and and they we also saw that we had<br>some scenarios where we said if this was<br>happening to your tamariki what would<br>you do next<br>and they had lower scores on their<br>in relation to medications<br>there was lots of use of nebulizers<br>for maori and pacific children but that<br>wasn't accompanied by greater levels of<br>care at other points and the pathway of<br>care so<br>there were no differences in the<br>proportions of children who were<br>receiving asthma preventers even though<br>the maori tamariki had more asthma<br>symptoms<br>this was particularly noticeable and the<br>children who reported severe morbidity<br>where there was serious underuse of<br>so what were the things that helped us<br>with the study<br>firstly<br>asthma is a really important issue in<br>mighty communities and a really<br>important question for the caregivers of<br>children with asthma<br>our a research team were devoured first<br>and we had a diverse range of door<br>knockers<br>and of interviewers<br>um and our interviews included maori um<br>and european and all of the larger<br>pacific ethnic groups so that was a<br>culturally safe experience for<br>participants because we were able to<br>because we used the sampling ratio we<br>were able to then match<br>the ethnicity of the interviewers and<br>the caregivers<br>we interviewed people at home or at some<br>other place that suited them and we<br>provided a koha to them for their time<br>i probably wouldn't use a sampling ratio<br>again because<br>i actually<br>in retrospect saying to people ah we<br>know you want to participate but sorry<br>you can't doesn't sit<br>easily<br>however it did allow us to match the<br>ethnicity of the interviews but i don't<br>study i want to talk about was a<br>cardiovascular disease a medicine health<br>literacy trial<br>and michelle lambert<br>has been a dear colleague of mine for a<br>very long time now<br>and for this was the first project that<br>we worked on<br>we it was an international trial and had<br>sites in canada australia and new<br>zealand<br>and<br>we did it in two phases so in phase one<br>we interviewed people and talked to them<br>about what they knew so these were all<br>maori who had had cardiovascular disease<br>and were on medicines for the<br>cardiovascular disease and we talked to<br>them about what they'd been told about<br>their medicines<br>what they would like to know about their<br>medicines and how they would like to<br>know it and we used that information to<br>design an intervention<br>which we then trialled<br>it was based and there were two urban<br>sites in canada an urban site in<br>australia and an urban and rural site<br>here in aotearoa<br>so people participated if they had a<br>diagnosis of cardiovascular disease<br>and were on medicines we're on at least<br>two of the four commonly used groups of<br>medicines to prevent future<br>heart attacks or strokes<br>the intervention was an education<br>session which people um<br>which<br>was given to people um three times<br>um<br>over a month period<br>was nurse-led<br>or and in australia they used health<br>educators<br>and it involved an interactive<br>app on a tablet uh people also received<br>a pill card with information about their<br>medicines and a written resource<br>there were the information was all<br>standardized but there were some<br>country-specific features so for example<br>graphic the graphics um and indigenous<br>language being used in in the resources<br>um our primary uh outcome or the thing<br>we were<br>measured how successful the um the<br>intervention was was looking at people's<br>knowledge about their medicines<br>and data was collected between february<br>so<br>we didn't have any problems recruiting<br>people<br>and we had very good retention<br>of people and<br>we had 171 participants<br>and<br>we lost 11 to follow up<br>one in new zealand and 10 in australia<br>and canada and in new zealand uh one of<br>our participants was admitted to a rest<br>home in another area so she couldn't<br>continue<br>i want to briefly show some results<br>as they highlight two things<br>so<br>these graphs show the percentage of<br>questions answered correctly and on the<br>left it's about statins which is<br>cholesterol medication and aspirin<br>and i want to highlight the pre-session<br>one scores<br>which are pretty low<br>and that was kind of i think consistent<br>with what people were telling us in our<br>qualitative interviews<br>but the intervention<br>really increased people's knowledge<br>certainly at the end of the intervention<br>there was a little drop<br>in people's um the percentage of correct<br>answers a week later so session two was<br>a week after session one<br>but scores popped up again and then a<br>little drop at the end of session three<br>which is three weeks later<br>uh and a further increase<br>and so we were very happy with these<br>results you can see that the pattern is<br>the same<br>for information about aspirin we were<br>very happy for these results with these<br>results<br>and likewise these are called<br>ace inhibitors<br>and beta blockers and they're both two<br>groups of medicines that are used for<br>of course you might say it's only a<br>month<br>and i would say yes that's right<br>but we wouldn't expect<br>we would expect that if this had been<br>implemented more broadly that<br>people would receive<br>top-ups<br>you know i know for myself if i'm not<br>using information regularly i lose it<br>and i don't know why we expect patients<br>to be given information a couple of<br>times and then somehow remember it<br>so what are the things that helped with<br>this trial<br>we had co-design of the intervention so<br>through the qualitative interviews<br>there was indigenous leadership and<br>we had excellent non-indigenous<br>colleagues who really understood and<br>were committed to the kaupapa<br>and we had excellent relationships with<br>the participating services who also<br>helped us design<br>how the implementation would go in their<br>clinic<br>again it was an important issue for<br>participants and they could see the<br>value in it so they were really keen on<br>participating<br>and we used appropriate tekanga<br>protocols and processes during<br>recruitment<br>during the delivery of the intervention<br>we had a koha for participation and we<br>also went back to all of the<br>participants and to<br>the<br>the third<br>trial that i want to talk about is<br>so it also focused on cardiovascular<br>disease medications and i want to<br>acknowledge vanessa silac who<br>ran the trial and marti harwood who was<br>a co-investigator with me<br>amongst a very large<br>research team<br>as we saw<br>uh with a literacy trial there are four<br>types of medicines that are recommended<br>to prevent cardiovascular disease and a<br>poly pill which is sometimes called a<br>fixed dose combination pill<br>incorporates all four of those medicines<br>into one capsule or one pill so in<br>theory at least it's easier for people<br>to take<br>the trial was done in 54 general<br>practices in auckland and the waikato<br>and again we wanted equal explanatory<br>power we wanted to recruit equal numbers<br>of maori and non-maori<br>our primary outcomes were self-reported<br>adherence so taking the pills<br>at 12 months<br>and<br>we also checked adherence against<br>dispensing information and found that<br>the self-report was very accurate which<br>was good<br>we were also interested in whether the<br>trial was acceptable to participants and<br>gps and whether there was any changes to<br>so the key findings here we were able to<br>recruit<br>just over 250 maori and non-maori and at<br>every step the potentially eligible<br>maori were more likely to say yes they<br>wanted to continue<br>and to be recruited into the trial<br>proper<br>we also had slightly higher follow-up of<br>maori then monmouth at 12 months worth<br>98 for maori and 95 for non-maori and at<br>the end of the trial 97 for maori and 91<br>um<br>the poly pill so this is self-reported<br>adherence at 12 months<br>um and so 79 of maori on the poly pill<br>and nine percent 983 percent of<br>non-maori reported<br>full adherence at 12 months and in the<br>usual care arm so receiving those four<br>different types of pills 42<br>of maori and 50<br>of non-maori were fully adherent<br>another interesting thing is that the<br>difference between non-maori and maori<br>was less in the polyp<br>so it looks like polypill<br>will help to reduce some of those<br>uh so what were the important things<br>again important issue for participants<br>we had people they desperately wanted to<br>be on the poly pill which was called the<br>little red heart pill and<br>were disappointed if they were<br>randomised to usual care<br>we had maori and non-maori investigators<br>and research nurses<br>both maori leadership and or<br>co-leadership and really significant<br>commitment from our non-mighty<br>colleagues to<br>equal explanatory power and to making<br>the trial safe and appropriate for maori<br>we use some specific stamping strategies<br>because the maori population is smaller<br>so<br>we needed to kind of involve<br>use more practices to identify enough<br>maori<br>so we<br>chose practices that are high proportion<br>of maori patients<br>we used lower thresholds for screening<br>so we tried to invite as many people to<br>be screened to see as if as they were<br>eligible as we could<br>and we continued maori recruitment for<br>six months after we finished non-maori<br>recruitment<br>the relationship between the research<br>nurse and the participant was really<br>good so we had a whole lot of maori<br>research nurses and they were the ones<br>that had the initial conversations about<br>participating and stayed with that<br>person right the way through the trial<br>and so they had excellent relationships<br>we did home-based assessments<br>whanau were involved prior to enrollment<br>and of course we used kopapa maori<br>processes and protocols and te kanga and<br>the final trial i want to talk about is<br>one that is underway at the moment<br>uh it's a research program that's<br>underway at the moment<br>and it's really and it's looking at lung<br>cancer screening with like using<br>low-dose ct scans<br>and you know lung cancer is the leading<br>cause of cancer deaths in aotearoa<br>there are terrible inequities associated<br>with it with maori two to three times<br>more likely to be diagnosed and to die<br>from lung cancer<br>and as this slide shows<br>lung cancer is the single largest<br>contributor to the gap in life<br>expectancy between maori and non-maori<br>and for women it contributes 2.8 years<br>of the 7.8 year difference<br>and for<br>men 1.7 years of the 8.6 year difference<br>this is northern region data i don't<br>think it'll be much different for the<br>rest of the country<br>so you know big problem and if we can do<br>something about it<br>we have a real opportunity<br>so lung cancer screening with low-dose<br>ct scans is effective um and<br>international trials they've<br>demonstrated that it reduces lung cancer<br>mortality<br>uh by over 26<br>and actually 36<br>in women um and so you know we have the<br>opportunity to make a real difference in<br>lung cancer outcomes and in lung cancer<br>inequities<br>but<br>a lung cancer screening program in new<br>zealand has to work for maori<br>if it doesn't then we will increase<br>those inequities<br>and there are already inequities in all<br>of our other national screening programs<br>and so teoranga pukahukahu is our<br>research program<br>and<br>it's a program that where we're<br>systematically collecting the<br>information we need and testing<br>strategies to ensure that a lung cancer<br>screening program will work for maori<br>it's a collaboration between auckland<br>and watamata regions<br>so what are we doing to ensure that our<br>work successfully includes maori<br>and that we're able to meet our aim<br>we've got mighty leadership across the<br>whole programme<br>and everyone involved with the project<br>maori and non-maori is committed to the<br>kaupapa and equity focused<br>maori who might be eligible for lung<br>cancer screening have been involved in<br>the project from very early on<br>we have had focus groups of people who<br>might be eligible in their whanau<br>to<br>hear what people thought about the idea<br>about lung cancer screening what would<br>encourage them to participate what would<br>be a barrier<br>and how they would like to be invited to<br>lung cancer screening<br>we did interviews that explored the same<br>issues with a larger group of people and<br>we established tehakutahi which is a<br>maori<br>whanau group who continue to work with<br>us and to help us design the next things<br>that we're going to do<br>we have a steering group where 10 of the<br>13 members are maori we also have a<br>technical advisory group and a<br>relationship with one of the current<br>international trials um the<br>international lung screening trial and<br>very strong excuse me local support<br>from uh<br>um<br>local maori ewe and local maori health<br>leaders<br>this is<br>the team that we're working with<br>this is the core team and of course<br>there is a larger team amongst various<br>components of the work but you can see<br>that<br>there's a range of ethnicities uh and a<br>range of roles<br>and it's<br>very it's a great team to be working<br>with<br>so what have we done uh so early on we<br>did our focus groups that i've described<br>and we did a re-analysis of a cost<br>effectiveness study that had been<br>undertaken that there had been a cost<br>effectiveness study that had been done<br>in 2018 and they concluded that<br>lung cancer screening would not be cost<br>effective<br>for anyone<br>and that was a show-stopper to any<br>conversation about lung cancer screening<br>in new zealand<br>and we were kind of like oh it doesn't<br>make sense that didn't make sense to us<br>and so we looked at what they had done<br>and we<br>they hadn't done any kind of can hadn't<br>had any consideration of equity<br>um summer we<br>had concerns about some of the<br>parameters that used and some of the<br>information that they had<br>and their analysis was quite old<br>so we repeated that cost effectiveness<br>analysis where we updated some of the<br>parameters and the information in it and<br>we did some equity kind of sensitivity<br>analysis as well and we showed that<br>actually lung cancer screening was<br>likely to be<br>cost effective for everyone but<br>especially for maori and especially<br>so that was good and that actually<br>restarted the whole conversation<br>we also did our surveys and established<br>and at the moment we are running an<br>invitation trial so and<br>when we spoke to<br>maori and our focus groups and surveys<br>we said how would you like to be invited<br>would you like your gp to invite you<br>would you like a central invitation like<br>bow screening<br>does<br>and a third of people said gp a third<br>said central and a third said don't care<br>just want an invite<br>so we're testing<br>that gp or central idea<br>we've also we'll also be doing we've got<br>some funding to look at<br>how smoking related lung disease or copd<br>is<br>diagnosed and managed alongside this<br>invitation trial and we're also doing<br>some bloods for circulating dna and<br>biomarkers alongside the invitation<br>trial<br>we've<br>also received funding for another<br>project that's going to look at the way<br>we predict people's risk<br>and we're starting that towards the end<br>in our surveys 91 of people said that<br>they would attend a screening program if<br>they were eligible and another eight<br>said they might so that was very<br>encouraging<br>the biggest barriers were<br>that<br>38 of people<br>agreed that<br>lung cancer couldn't be cured and you<br>know that's our experience of lung<br>cancer<br>and 25<br>agreed that lung cancer treatment is<br>worse than lung cancer itself and again<br>i think that's our experience because a<br>lot of the older treatments are pretty<br>difficult for people<br>a third of people were worried that<br>health workers would be judgmental about<br>them because they were or had been a<br>smoker and so i think for us and who<br>work when we work with<br>people we really have to bear in mind<br>that<br>love the person<br>hate the drug the tobacco companies<br>you know<br>they're they're the they're the problem<br>you know the person that's smoking or<br>has been a smoker is not the problem and<br>we cannot judge them because we will do<br>harm because they will avoid us<br>and they'll avoid taking part in things<br>things you know that why they might want<br>to<br>take part find lung cancer early<br>and to be able to reassure themselves<br>and therefore know if they had a<br>negative scan<br>and then things that would make<br>attendance difficult having other<br>responsibilities<br>cost<br>worry again about being judged<br>transport and timing of appointments and<br>worry about radiation exposure and they<br>were concerns for around about 15<br>of people<br>i've mentioned the cost effectiveness<br>study<br>so what is the lung cancer screening<br>process so we identify people who might<br>be eligible for lung cancer screening<br>and in the in our trial that is people<br>who are 55 to 74<br>mighty and they're not in their gp<br>recorded in their general practice notes<br>as having been a never smoker<br>and then those eligible people<br>undergo a risk assessment because<br>with lung cancer screening because it<br>involves radiation<br>we don't want to screen everyone who's<br>ever smoked we only want to screen<br>people who are at higher risk of<br>developing a lung cancer and so we use a<br>risk prediction<br>model called plco m2012<br>i'm sure you're all dying to know that<br>and then people who<br>are above a risk threshold have a shared<br>decision-making process<br>and if they decide to go ahead they'll<br>have a ct scan<br>and then there's a process but in the ct<br>scans we're really looking for nodules<br>so abner more normal little areas<br>that some of them<br>may go on to develop into a cancer<br>and there's a structured way that we<br>manage those nodules depending on how<br>big they are and what they look like<br>what their characteristics are like<br>there are also things called incidental<br>findings which are things other things<br>in the lungs or the top of the abdomen<br>because you know we scan right down to<br>the bottom of the lungs so we see parts<br>of the liver and the adrenal glands so<br>we start we sometimes find things<br>in other areas<br>and of course we have to take action on<br>those<br>outside of a research program if we had<br>a national program then people would<br>have repeat scans either at one or two<br>yearly intervals and there's still<br>research happening internationally to<br>decide what's the best interview<br>interval<br>and<br>we should be doing smoking cessation and<br>copd assessment and management alongside<br>the lung cancer screening<br>i've talked to i've talked about this<br>so who's involved in the trial and<br>that where our main outcome is comparing<br>gp and central hub arms<br>but we're also collecting information<br>that we will need to set up a national<br>program so<br>things like<br>what proportion of people<br>we test are eligible<br>for a ct scan what proportion of people<br>who have a risk assessment are eligible<br>for a ct scan what proportion of ct<br>scans have an abnormal finding how many<br>cancers we find so all of those types of<br>things we're collecting information on<br>and so i'll just give you a wee taste of<br>some of that secondary<br>information so this is to july 2022<br>and we had identified 814 people who<br>might be eligible<br>about 10 of them we weren't able to<br>contact or<br>declined to go any further in the study<br>189 people were<br>not eligible to be in the study so that<br>was things like that had a ct scan of<br>their chest and that last two years<br>those kind of things<br>and so there were 400 in total where<br>we<br>were eligible to have risk assessment<br>there were also 53 people who deferred<br>and what that means is they haven't<br>turned 55 yet this year and so we've<br>just put them off until they turn 55 and<br>then we'll be in touch with them again<br>so um<br>247 people had completed the risk<br>assessment and of those 51<br>were eligible for a ct scan and that's a<br>little bit<br>of the people who are eligible for a ct<br>scan of those 126<br>just under 90<br>had chosen to go ahead with a ct scan<br>and that was a little bit higher than<br>with theorized as well and you know i<br>mean<br>early days but we're very happy and<br>interestingly it's consistent with<br>um<br>what the finals were and then and<br>questionnaire where<br>91 of people said that they would<br>we had completed at that point 96 scans<br>and 92 have been reviewed by the<br>radiologists<br>75 of people have essentially in a<br>normal scan<br>good news and then the other 25<br>have<br>nodules<br>which require repeat scans either at 12<br>months or three months<br>or in some instances<br>direct a referral for investigation and<br>we have diagnosed a number of cancers<br>and the number of cancers we've<br>diagnosed is pretty consistent with what<br>we'd expect from the international<br>trials<br>here's what people we ask people what<br>about their experience<br>and here's what people say<br>i was very happy to see my invite<br>i think it should be rolled out<br>nationally<br>um and i was thrilled to see we're<br>taking specific steps so i think this<br>kind of reflects<br>that people are happy to participate if<br>they see it as an important issue for<br>them um<br>again very favorable responses<br>and<br>around<br>the staff that were running the research<br>project<br>and again i think reflecting that you<br>know if you have the right people<br>engaging with people then that is really<br>and i thought this is a great quote this<br>is someone who did not meet the risk<br>threshold at the risk assessment i was<br>50 50 pleased and relieved but a little<br>bit disappointed<br>so<br>so it's very early days and i hope i'm<br>not jinxing myself<br>but we're very encouraging and again the<br>things i think that are important are<br>that<br>have been helpful an important issue<br>an absolute commitment amongst this<br>team to designing lung cancer screening<br>that works for maori<br>we've got substantial mighty leadership<br>and support like not only<br>and the team but also you know the ewe<br>leader ewe support<br>maori health other maori health<br>leadership support<br>and non-maori colleagues who are totally<br>committed to the kaupapa as well<br>we've had co-design right from the<br>get-go and that's ongoing<br>and the majority of staff are<br>interacting with participants in maori<br>and of course we have taken<br>so i wanted<br>to acknowledge<br>that there are many past and present<br>projects that i haven't been able to<br>talk about tonight and their absence<br>isn't a measure of a lack of importance<br>but simply that i couldn't find a<br>narrative that would encompass<br>everything in the 45 minutes that were<br>available<br>finally i want to thank my whanau and my<br>friends who come<br>kanohiki<br>and<br>on the web<br>and<br>i want to acknowledge my dad who passed<br>away 12 years ago from lung cancer<br>so<br>nauruda te nakoto tena koto tena tatou<br>katoa<br>so<br>we did get a solo soprano because sue<br>kia ora koto<br>i'm trish priest i'm the acting pro vice<br>chancellor of health sciences at the<br>moment and i'm here to thank professor<br>sue kringle for her excellent lecture<br>myth takes about maori and research<br>i'm particularly delighted to be the one<br>who's doing this<br>i started as the head of department of<br>preventive and social medicine on the<br>same day as sue started in her position<br>in the department<br>and i<br>was the head of department when i<br>managed to bully her into applying for<br>promotion<br>i'm very thankful yeah<br>and in fact we both got promoted in the<br>same round and i can tell you that if<br>you need someone to keep a secret suse<br>woman because the way it happens is the<br>the vice chancellor rings you a few days<br>before the announcement and says now<br>you've got your promotion but you're not<br>allowed to tell anyone<br>so i rang sue<br>and said<br>have you had any calls from the vice<br>chancellor and she said no<br>and so now that sue no longer sits<br>within preventive and social medicine i<br>had to get a different job so that i<br>could thank her for her<br>ipl because i turn out to still be her<br>boss<br>now the waiata we just sang is about<br>planting seeds at the right time of the<br>year for the best food production<br>and sue has given us just a few examples<br>of how over her career she has planted<br>ideas and people which will come to<br>fruition and improvements in her maori<br>and reductions in health inequities<br>in this lecture sue has demonstrated<br>through her work that as well as the<br>really interesting and important results<br>of the studies<br>maori are enthusiastic to participate in<br>research to be recruited and stay in the<br>project if<br>and it's the if that sue has clearly<br>identified and from which which many of<br>us can learn<br>so from the projects that sue described<br>to us we learn that if<br>the research is important to maori the<br>research participants and their whanau<br>and caregivers<br>it's maori led and co-designed<br>there is a deliberate strategy to<br>recruit maori that's appropriate in<br>terms of process and time frame<br>structured information is provided in<br>culturally appropriate ways by the right<br>people<br>interviews are carried out in a place<br>that suits participants by someone they<br>can relate to and trust<br>and participants time and contribution<br>is acknowledged then maori participation<br>recruitment and retention and research<br>can be excellent<br>sue has truly demonstrated that some of<br>the stereotyped ideas about research<br>with maori that she has discussed are<br>indeed myths<br>um i actually met sue<br>first about 20 years ago when we both<br>worked on the cervical cancer audit in<br>auckland<br>she was inspiring even then as well as<br>being great fun to work with and it's<br>been so great to<br>catch up with her again back here and<br>work alongside her<br>there are so many things that sue has<br>done or is doing and people she's<br>supported and inspired that she didn't<br>have time to talk about tonight<br>sue is a force of nature i have no idea<br>how she manages to do all of the things<br>she does<br>in teaching and research service to<br>maori to health to the university and to<br>the country not to mention as a<br>clinician and many of our discussions um<br>when i was head of department apart from<br>bullying her into applying for promotion<br>were me saying sue you just can't take<br>anything more on you have to start<br>saying no to people<br>i was obviously largely unsuccessful um<br>i have nothing but admiration for sue um<br>i think that's a brilliant example of<br>getting it getting your first hrc grant<br>and then thinking i'll just do a<br>heartless fellowship while i'm at it<br>it's typical sue anyway we at otago are<br>lucky and proud to have sue as a member<br>of our staff and i am absolutely<br>delighted to congratulate her on her<br>promotion and to celebrate with her now<br>i have a gift<br>a very exciting gift from the university<br>in recognition of this moment thank you<br>and<br>i would like you to first<br>finish finish listening to me join me in<br>congratulating sue and then<br>join us in the staff club for<br>refreshments to continue<br>celebrating sue's amazing career so far<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
