and it's my great<br>pleasure and honor to be hosting you<br>this evening for this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor mark<br>seymour<br>welcome to you all here gathered in<br>person it's fantastic to see you uh<br>welcome to to the people who are online<br>watching this live or who may be<br>watching it at their leisure in the in<br>the future<br>a very special acknowledgement<br>to mark's partner grant who's here<br>somewhere and also to<br>his<br>brother matthew and sister-in-law sarah<br>it's fantastic to have you here in<br>person<br>with us uh these occasions these<br>inaugural professorial lectures are very<br>special events<br>the fact that some of us are wearing our<br>robes as an indicator that it's a<br>special occasion<br>in the modern university we wear these<br>robes very rarely not like the old days<br>where people used to teach in them we<br>only wear these for very special<br>occasions so if you think about it here<br>at the university of otago we wear these<br>for convocation when students start<br>their academic journey we wear them for<br>graduation when we're celebrating them<br>completing those journeys and we wear<br>them for inaugural professorial lectures<br>when we celebrate a colleague attaining<br>the highest academic rank<br>in the university<br>so the fact that we're dressed up<br>is very very special it's a sign that we<br>care about a special<br>occasion we're really here to celebrate<br>the core<br>mission of the university which is to<br>produce knowledge and to share it<br>to share it with students to share it<br>with colleagues and to share it with the<br>wider public<br>so these are special because they embody<br>and celebrate the endeavors that at the<br>very heart<br>of the university<br>they're an occasion where we celebrate<br>the scholarly journey of a colleague and<br>we celebrate the way in which they've<br>contributed to our institution in<br>society through generating new insights<br>and sharing those insights through their<br>writing through their teaching and<br>so i think it's very appropriate given<br>the nature and the mission of the<br>university that we gather in person<br>to celebrate this evening<br>an outstanding historian mark seymour<br>and also we gather to celebrate the<br>importance of that mission of generating<br>and sharing knowledge within our<br>community<br>i'm mark i need to convey to you the the<br>greetings and the best regards from the<br>vice chancellor who is away in<br>sahih christchurch he regrets he cannot<br>be here but wants to send his greetings<br>to you<br>i will hand over in a second to<br>professor tim cooper who will offer a<br>full introduction to mark<br>but as a fellow historian<br>um a colleague and a friend of marks<br>at least i hope i account in that<br>category<br>i also wanted to say three things about<br>him and so i'm not trying to steal youth<br>undertone<br>first<br>i think mark is truly a world-class<br>historian<br>he reads texts meticulously<br>and and that's very high praise from a<br>historian we really care about how<br>people read texts<br>he thinks really hard about context he<br>engages with a really wide<br>historiographical terrain<br>he has a terrific<br>cinematic eye for detail<br>and he writes beautifully<br>uh secondly so that's a lot and and the<br>first point but that's one<br>two<br>mark is an incredibly dedicated<br>thoughtful and outstanding teacher he<br>cares deeply about students and their<br>learning and they deeply appreciate him<br>as a teacher and they find them<br>incredibly engaging<br>thirdly<br>mark is a wonderful colleague<br>and he's a terrific institutional<br>citizen<br>historians can often be solitary<br>creatures particularly the ones that<br>spend a lot of time in archives but mark<br>is a great collaborator<br>as a team teacher<br>as an editor as a critical and<br>constructive reader<br>and as a colleague<br>so it is terrific that we all come<br>together this evening as a collective to<br>mark your achievements mark<br>um katie enough from me i will now hand<br>over to professor tim cooper<br>to<br>i am tim i am the head of the school of<br>arts and it's a it's a genuine honor to<br>introduce a historian of the highest<br>caliber and basically what i'm going to<br>do now is just say what tony's just said<br>mark is an excellent historian who has<br>from the distance of ortipoti dunedin on<br>this side of the world shaped the field<br>of italian history<br>and he's done that in several ways<br>from 2015 to 2020 he was one of the<br>co-editors of the premier ear academic<br>journal in the field modern italy<br>and from that vantage point and through<br>a great deal of hard work he fostered<br>innovative new directions in the field<br>so he's he has shaped the field over the<br>course of his career he has organised no<br>fewer than seven conferences<br>and venues as far flung as london<br>melbourne and bangkok<br>but above all his own scholarship has<br>established mark's influence so his<br>first book was called debating divorce<br>in italy and i went in in search of<br>reviews it's the it's the only book on<br>this subject in the english language<br>and reviewers spoke of it<br>well argued and highly accessible<br>elegantly written and impeccably<br>researched<br>a precious contribution to overall<br>italian political history and in<br>particular the history of the state<br>church relationship in that country<br>high praise<br>for a first book<br>his most recent book is emotional arenas<br>life love and death in 1870s italy and<br>it extends his scholarship into a<br>vibrant new field of the history of<br>emotions and to quote one reviewer this<br>is a brilliant book<br>thoughtful<br>well contextualized<br>methodologically sophisticated and<br>casting light on a whole series of<br>questions from the nature of later 19th<br>century italian society to the history<br>of emotions<br>there is much that is incredibly<br>impressive here<br>so mark is a an impressive<br>historian<br>he's also<br>an excellent teacher<br>i know that because as head of school i<br>get to see a lot of student evaluations<br>of teaching and mark's evaluations are<br>consistently among the most impressive<br>so just just to give you a couple of<br>comments from students by way of<br>illustration this from an undergraduate<br>mark was a very lovely lecturer<br>everything was planned out very well and<br>he was easy to understand he is<br>absolutely amazing<br>and he was always a pleasure and<br>excitement to come and listen to<br>and this comment from an honour student<br>mark's knowledge and enthusiasm for the<br>subject has made this a very enjoyable<br>paper<br>he has a unique ability to encourage<br>lively discussion amongst the whole<br>class<br>this leading from behind manner means<br>that new knowledge is revealed as the<br>discussions progress<br>where i come to understand something for<br>myself<br>instead of being told what to think<br>about any given subject<br>and that is the mark of a great teacher<br>i asked his colleagues to give me some<br>words to describe mark as a colleague<br>and i'd like to pass on some of those<br>words now this is what they appreciate<br>about him<br>he is generous friendly and encouraging<br>as head of program he is authentic<br>supportive and flexible<br>he is supportive considerate thoughtful<br>and caring of all his colleagues<br>he works hard as a leader consistently<br>going above and beyond driven by how<br>much he cares<br>he is attentive and takes a personal<br>interest in each of his colleagues<br>he takes pride in his colleagues and in<br>the program<br>his upbeatness<br>and his sense of fun<br>as students like the personal touch he<br>brings to his lectures including his<br>he makes it his mission to prompt<br>everyone staff postgraduates to be<br>involved<br>and even the postgraduates had something<br>to say they mentioned his fostering of<br>community and support of students<br>he has high standards for himself as<br>well as his students which brings out<br>the best in them<br>and i discovered when in season he<br>brings roses daily into his office which<br>warped this beautiful perfume around for<br>and mark as head of school i'd just like<br>to add my sincere appreciation for the<br>way that you<br>carry yourself as a cedar program the<br>work you do the commitment you show<br>and<br>you are just so good to work with<br>thank you<br>and so uh it is with sincere pleasure<br>that i introduce one of the university's<br>finest teachers<br>an all-around good egg<br>and a scholar of genuinely international<br>stature<br>professor mark seymour<br>thank goodness still here this is an<br>eccentricity of mine this is the<br>presidential telephone<br>good evening<br>well good morning<br>thank you tony<br>thank you tim for your very kind words i<br>don't know whether i suffer a time<br>penalty because that was longer than i<br>calculated<br>but i'd like to thank you for your<br>guidance over the years your support<br>uh tony in your case many many years<br>thank you to bailey maclean the<br>indomitably cheerful and helpful ipl<br>organizer<br>and the technical support team<br>the absolutely<br>indispensable but very often invisible<br>allies of all otago lecturers<br>welcome to you here present<br>thank you all for your interest and<br>support<br>and for those online i would like to<br>greet them personally because i know the<br>online experience isn't the same<br>so to justine robert sue giacomo<br>lisa<br>tim<br>maybe peter fullset milena aroma thanks<br>for tuning in<br>and when you catch up with the recording<br>with your popcorn as you say will<br>greetings to sylvia ella philippa and<br>all other members of my english family<br>i trust dad is here with all of us in<br>spirit and i know he will be impatient<br>already<br>for me to get on with it<br>so allow me though<br>before the lecture proper a three uh<br>possibly three minutes possibly less uh<br>prologue<br>and it's about the inaugural lecture<br>tradition itself<br>i've not heard anyone mention this<br>before<br>which isn't to say that it hasn't been<br>done but it's always been typical<br>of me to ask questions<br>a german guy once nicknamed me question<br>mark and he didn't mean it kindly<br>a question that's been on my mind since<br>even before i applied for promotion is<br>why do i have to give an inaugural<br>lecture<br>well<br>i did some research and<br>like universities themselves the ipl<br>began in the medieval period<br>some german universities can trace<br>regular inaugural lectures<br>in sweden<br>uppsala university has held inaugural<br>lectures every year since 1625<br>otago has had ipls regularly since 1996.<br>the formula is mostly quite similar it's<br>a 40 to 50 minute exposition of the<br>academics research journey looking<br>backwards and in some cases<br>especially if the professor is young so<br>i won't be doing it forecasting future<br>research programs<br>there can be flags<br>processions<br>and even orchestral music<br>at a target we have restrained pomp just<br>enough to hint at the occasions<br>medieval roots<br>but auckland<br>on the other hand they don't even wear<br>regalia and their vibe is<br>self-consciously gender casual<br>prologue over and now on to a more<br>structured overview of my ipl<br>which now that i've convinced myself<br>that i must give it for the sake of<br>that looks a bit messy but i'll deal<br>with it uh quickly<br>essentially just to give you a sense of<br>where we are in the lecture<br>a road trip<br>introduced me to italy and inspired me<br>to go to university<br>so i'll tell you a wee bit about that<br>and then i'll move on to my tertiary<br>education how it unfolded<br>introducing you to some of the people<br>who guided my research path at both ba<br>and postgraduate level<br>after the be after the phd there was a<br>bit of an intermediate as i struggled to<br>find a job<br>then this university<br>saved me by offering me a little seat in<br>its waka<br>and for that i've been incredibly<br>grateful ever since<br>in the way historians divide things up<br>so they can make more sense i'll cover<br>my otago career<br>section in three main phases relating to<br>my research activities it's been a messy<br>process and all the elements overlap<br>but i've tried to impose structure<br>retrospectively which is essentially<br>what historians do<br>so yes broadly speaking what this<br>lecture will do is historicize the<br>research side of my career<br>that is it locates my work across its<br>historical context<br>presenting it as a little talk<br>in conversation with the waves of time<br>while its navigator<br>kept an eye on the rocks of theory and<br>place<br>so my path<br>through academia to academia ran through<br>it in fact hasn't been<br>traditional or linear<br>after an adolescence split between one<br>parent in england and another in<br>australia i finish school with an<br>undistinguished record<br>and need to stay put and to take charge<br>of my own life<br>this meant work rather than study<br>economic conditions in 1980s sydney were<br>such that you could work in unexciting<br>after a few years though my feet started<br>to itch<br>and with my partner of the day we<br>hatched a plot for a six-month journey<br>by car<br>notice how blithely i say the word<br>partner<br>you may also notice that he was of the<br>same sex as me<br>that might not raise eyebrows now but it<br>did then<br>in fact<br>for the first two years of our<br>relationship under new south wales law<br>we could have been put in prison for it<br>such prospects were no doubt among the<br>influences that shaped my interest in<br>the personal and the political<br>but that was a way off yet we borrowed a<br>car<br>from my english family and set off<br>the car was a citroen c2 2cv<br>and my dad ever the wit<br>it was 1986.<br>the previous year french secret service<br>agents had sunk greenpeace's rainbow<br>warrior in auckland harbour<br>in april 1986 while we were driving east<br>in austria chernobyl nuclear power<br>station then in the ussr<br>we turned and fled west<br>wondering if this was a foretaste of how<br>history would end<br>let's not forget that the broader<br>geopolitical context was the cold war<br>and we constantly feared oblivion<br>our final destination was the remote<br>west coast of the italian island of<br>sardinia<br>here we stayed with the aunt of a close<br>friend<br>whom we picked up in rome<br>the aunt had never met us but she and<br>the entire extended family welcomed us<br>i didn't speak a word of italian<br>and only one of them spoke english<br>but we we became part of the clan and<br>the visit was life-changing<br>compared with my own dispersed family<br>i was struck with the unitedness of<br>sylvia's<br>this planted a seed of curiosity<br>in a more general sense<br>on that trip faced with europe's<br>historical and cultural riches<br>i had almost no idea how it fit how they<br>fitted on a timeline and related to each<br>other<br>my mind was filled with questions about<br>everything from food to family mores to<br>cultural variations as we moved from<br>place to place<br>i also had questions about big things<br>like the possibility of a radioactive<br>cloud that portended armageddon<br>over that journey i developed a first to<br>fill these blanks<br>and find out more about why things were<br>not long after returning back to sydney<br>i enrolled in a ba at the university of<br>sydney initially choosing italian french<br>philosophy<br>and a subject that was then called<br>economic history<br>the last subject you may be surprised to<br>know gripped me most quickly and for<br>that i give credit to my first year<br>lecturer robert aldridge<br>there was nothing like powerpoint in<br>those days<br>and robert didn't even use an overhead<br>projector<br>but i still remember the feeling of<br>enthralment in those first few weeks<br>it felt like suddenly seeing the past<br>through 3d spectacles<br>all of a sudden there was depth and<br>perspective unfurling between before my<br>one of robert's essay questions gave me<br>a first dizzying taste of playing with<br>depth and perspective in my own way<br>he invited us to compare historians<br>accounts of the french revolution<br>with those to be gleaned from honored<br>balzac's novel per glorio<br>set at the same time<br>it really made us think about the lines<br>between fact and fiction<br>between history and historical<br>literature<br>ultimately it was a question about the<br>malleability the constructiveness<br>of truth<br>over the next three years i wrestled<br>with the concepts of the fashionable and<br>niles school<br>with its three-speed concept of<br>historical time and fascination with<br>mentalities montalite as the french call<br>it i also learnt to love social history<br>history from below of ordinary people<br>and i even dabbled with quantitative and<br>econometric history things we never talk<br>about anymore unless it's in history<br>four five two<br>i knew that i'd come to the right place<br>and chosen the right subject<br>a place<br>on the other side of campus in the<br>italian department things were not quite<br>as<br>intoxicating initially<br>mainly i think because learning a<br>language from scratch as an adult takes<br>huge amounts of hard yakka<br>so my affair with italian was slower to<br>ignite<br>but ignite it did<br>thanks largely to brilliant lecturers<br>like mirelas griboni jose vincentini<br>paolo marmini<br>nicoleta zanardi nina rubino and later<br>when we got to dante's divine comedy<br>studying in sydney's italian department<br>was like being embraced into an extended<br>family of several italian mamma<br>all at once<br>for example at the end of second year<br>i happen to mention to dr marmini that i<br>was off to italy to practice my italian<br>in december and january<br>without a moment's hesitation she asked<br>if i'd like to use her apartment in<br>ferrara i was to buzz her aunt martha<br>who lived on the floor below<br>and i could stay as long as i liked<br>i have to admit that philosophy and<br>french could not compete in terms of<br>excitement or real estate for that<br>matter<br>i'd been captivated by italy during that<br>1986<br>oe<br>but going there again after two years of<br>italian language at university was<br>something else again<br>revisiting aunt sylvia in western<br>sardinia i could now hold conversations<br>about her life and the history that<br>she'd lived through<br>this opened more perspectives on the<br>past much more personal ones<br>this is your lecturer<br>in sylvia's courtyard in december 1989<br>receiving instructions on how to do<br>laundry<br>italian style<br>with a photo of the very same courtyard<br>when it was sylvia's house in the 1950s<br>when in effect that courtyard was the<br>family bathroom<br>you want to see sylvia don't you well<br>here she is in 2019 on my last visit to<br>italy aged 97 having just cooked me a<br>large plate of ravioli<br>she was born in istria<br>the northern adriatic region of italy as<br>it was then at least in 1922<br>that was the year that mussolini came to<br>power<br>and she'll be in dubious company for her<br>upcoming centenary<br>her birthplace was absorbed into<br>communist yugoslavia after world war ii<br>unlike most italian families she knew<br>has fled<br>later to disperse across the globe some<br>to australia which is how i got my<br>connection<br>sylvia herself married a naval officer<br>from sardinia<br>and she made the great cultural leap<br>from a part of italy that was<br>essentially austrian<br>to one that she experienced to use her<br>own words as third world<br>during these conversations i became<br>really fascinated by italy's dramatic<br>past<br>and i was as fascinated by the history<br>from below the personal social history<br>as i was by the geopolitical waves on<br>which sylvia's<br>and the lives of millions of others were<br>tossed<br>we could probably locate the germination<br>of my interest in modern italian history<br>personal and political<br>around 1989<br>the year of the end of the cold war<br>and according to some<br>history itself<br>but for me<br>after earning my ba honours with a<br>thesis on italian migration to australia<br>the next step was a phd in modern<br>italian history at the university of<br>connecticut united states<br>i went there to study with a renowned<br>british scholar john a davis<br>and there is a picture of me which i<br>have to admit<br>some of you may notice that i have<br>stalinised<br>there was a rival standing between us in<br>that photo and to fit it in you can just<br>see the remains of their jacket between<br>us<br>john's teaching was my foundation in<br>modern italy's complex history and<br>historiography<br>and he helped me develop a thesis topic<br>that explored the ideological importance<br>of family and marriage in modern italian<br>history<br>before that i had to get through three<br>daunting years of postgraduate work that<br>are typical of the united states system<br>a full immersion in historiography<br>theoretical dimension of historical<br>research<br>the post-cold war world may have been<br>safer in many ways<br>but in the academic world the collapse<br>of old intellectual frameworks left<br>space for a multiplicity of sometimes<br>bewildering<br>alternative theoretical approaches<br>leading examples were gender history<br>cultural history and the linguistic turn<br>i won't expand on those in this context<br>but they and others all left their mark<br>in 1997 after the coursework i set off<br>for rome to research a thesis on italy's<br>long debates<br>over the nature of marriage and whether<br>left that all sound terribly grand tour<br>and aristocratic i got a job<br>as a part-time lecturer in a u.s<br>college's rome<br>campus for a reasonably peppercorn<br>salary but<br>i also got free board and lodging in<br>return for being the night watchman<br>and a priceless perk<br>was the college's location<br>in a monastery atop the aventine hill<br>with as the upper picture shows a view<br>of the ruins of imperial rome across the<br>lest the view risks sending my<br>classicist colleagues to purgatory with<br>envy<br>let me stress that what i viewed most in<br>rome were the interiors of libraries and<br>archives<br>chiefly the parliamentary libraries and<br>the national library and there are some<br>little<br>shots<br>you can't see these but those tomes say<br>things like pages 22<br>672 to 25 458.<br>my research question was how italian<br>attitudes to divorce were shaped in the<br>late 19th century<br>there was in fact no divorce law in<br>italy until 1970<br>and for that reason italy was one of a<br>handful of outliers in modern western<br>history<br>the little research that had been done<br>focused on the 1960s<br>i wanted to explore how the personal had<br>been political<br>at least a century earlier<br>from the time of italian national<br>the new political class of unified italy<br>saw the saw church jurisdiction over<br>marriage as a symbol of a long<br>ecclesiastical stranglehold on italian<br>life right into the bedroom<br>after unification<br>the state quickly took uh took control<br>of marriage law<br>in turn<br>the church mobilized to prevent the<br>introduction of the divorce law<br>one of my key findings in fact was that<br>in doing so the church learnt<br>how to operate effectively within modern<br>political frameworks<br>the prospect of a divorce law i argued<br>gave birth to italian political<br>catholicism<br>exploring all this meant ransacking 40<br>years worth of parliamentary discussions<br>recorded in these tomes<br>plus contemporary philosophical and<br>religious tracts newspaper commentary<br>popular literature<br>and even novels i hadn't forgotten<br>robbins robert's first year essay<br>question<br>with italian public life an exclusively<br>male affair it was hard to get women<br>into the picture<br>but i knew they needed to be there<br>my wonderful external supervisor mary<br>gibson<br>from the john jay college of criminal<br>justice at the city university of new<br>york was my guide here<br>with her help i found that the matter<br>became a notable issue the first wave<br>that is to say like late 19th century<br>feminism<br>my study the phd concluded in the early<br>1900s by which time the prospect of a<br>divorce law had been banished<br>it was not to return to the political<br>agenda in italy until after world war ii<br>that left me with another few decades to<br>research<br>to bring the story<br>to uh italy's 1970<br>divorce law<br>phd awarded in august 2001 just after i<br>turned 40.<br>what i now needed was an academic job<br>that would earn me a grown-up salary and<br>support to bring the research to its<br>natural<br>conclusion<br>so we now move to this little<br>intermediate between tribulation and<br>salvation<br>at first<br>having grown up mostly in australia i<br>hoped that i would get a lecture ship<br>anywhere in australia<br>you may think that was a strange place<br>to look but i didn't go there looking<br>for a job it began actually with an<br>awkward<br>an awkward inter mezzo that was to last<br>more than two years<br>i began this like i began the whole<br>research journey with another road trip<br>this time from sydney to cape<br>tribulation in far north queensland<br>now i didn't know that my students knew<br>about my predilection for a particular<br>type of car but one of my colleagues<br>last week did suggest that my cars might<br>be a good organizing principle for this<br>lecture rather than<br>this is in fact the last car that you<br>will see in this lecture i'm going to do<br>the traditional way<br>once back in sydney i got on the<br>tutoring bandwagon at my alma mater<br>waiting for a less precarious job to<br>materialize<br>but i didn't even get on the shortlist<br>for a few lectures for the few lecture<br>ships that came up and sometimes<br>it really felt like the road to nowhere<br>i was just on the verge of going back to<br>university to retrain as a lawyer like<br>my sensible and now high-earning brother<br>and several friends<br>when<br>salvation came in the form of an<br>interview at a university that i have to<br>confess i had not heard of<br>otago<br>by the skin of my teeth i believe<br>i got the job here<br>and i started work in february 2004<br>and the rest is<br>the first challenge was to adapt my<br>teaching to a kiwi context<br>i began with a 300 level paper on italy<br>the very one that i'm teaching this year<br>but it was more primitive back then<br>unlike australia<br>new zealand had never received large<br>numbers of italian immigrants and as a<br>result italy was a much more abstract<br>concept for kiwi students<br>i had to find ways to make it less so<br>insights from the anal school about the<br>relationship between geography and<br>history<br>came to my aid<br>in one of the first lectures i used<br>overhead transparencies it was<br>pre-powerpoint<br>to illustrate the geographical<br>similarities between italy and new<br>zealand<br>long<br>thin<br>mountainous<br>lots of coast<br>seismically active<br>north-south division<br>and so on quite a lot in common actually<br>but in a fortuitous moment of confusion<br>i also accidentally put the new zealand<br>only to discover that the two places<br>this geographical kinship<br>allowed me somehow to feel that i was<br>teaching the history of altera as one of<br>aotearoa's long-lost twins<br>even so<br>i could not rely on the canonically<br>self-evident historical primacy<br>that i was used to italy commanding<br>just about everywhere except new zealand<br>this i think made me work particularly<br>hard at my teaching<br>and ultimately<br>having a lectureship at otago allowed me<br>to turn my phd thesis into a book<br>by completing the 20th century part of<br>the story<br>i absolutely adored researching the 50s<br>60s and 70s<br>where the divorce question got wound<br>into second wave feminism<br>it's one reason i so love this picture<br>which captures the spirit of the times<br>for me<br>italy's lack of a divorce law was an<br>increasingly important discussion point<br>in popular magazines from the late 1950s<br>onwards<br>and they became an important source for<br>they were much more colorful than the<br>19th century parliamentary debates and i<br>was incredibly impressed by their<br>commitment<br>to the personal and the political and<br>this this this lovely cover the woman is<br>sort of ironically<br>hinting at the taboo of divorce it was<br>1965.<br>the slog the the title below says<br>divorce and women<br>we're now opening a grand debate so<br>belying the finger over the mouth we're<br>so<br>my first book examining 114 years of<br>italian<br>culture pump of culture wars<br>about marriage divorce the church the<br>state and the people of italy came out<br>in 2006.<br>it took a while to get research momentum<br>back after that<br>but when i did i went to the archives<br>that housed among other things<br>please for marital separation people<br>were permitted to live apart but not<br>divorce<br>and the records of marital strife that<br>had led to violent crime<br>the plan was to produce several journal<br>articles with themes of gender<br>love and emotions<br>so we're coming to part 3 b now which is<br>various<br>projects in the intervening years<br>between books<br>i mentioned emotions and they have<br>become a strong interest of mine and<br>they started to quite early<br>other scholars were beginning to be very<br>interested in emotions around 2007<br>to eight<br>i was able to team up with colleagues<br>penelope morris of glasgow and francesco<br>riccati in queensland<br>to run a conference in london on italy<br>and the emotions<br>under the auspices of the uk's<br>association for the study of modern<br>italy<br>i guess our idea was we wanted to see<br>what was out there and putting out a<br>call for papers is a great way to see<br>what people are up to<br>well that call for papers hit the<br>jackpot it elicited the largest number<br>of submissions in the history of the<br>association<br>and these gave us the basis for a couple<br>of nice co-edited publications<br>a special issue of the association's<br>journal modern italy<br>an edited volume uh in italian for 14 of<br>the italian language<br>papers<br>and here is what those<br>two publications look like co-edited by<br>three years later in 2015 as tim<br>mentioned penny and i took over<br>as the co-editors<br>of modern italy<br>it was a daunting task in terms of<br>workload and i thank grant for telling<br>me that it would be a good thing to do<br>that was absolutely right<br>it was hugely beneficial in terms of<br>giving<br>me<br>an overview of and even a shaping hand i<br>don't think i shaped the field but i<br>prodded it and pushed it a little bit<br>and i'll just give you one example of<br>that shaping<br>so in an attempt to de-center<br>an inherently eurocentric feel just a<br>little bit<br>penny and i looked at a map of the world<br>and we noticed that bangkok was halfway<br>between glasgow and otago<br>so<br>we chose it as the location<br>for a conference which we called<br>italy and asia<br>past and present<br>at mahidon university on the outskirts<br>of bangkok<br>it was a particular delight<br>to have paola there it took a fair bit<br>of arm-twisting i have to say<br>but embodying expertise both in italy<br>and<br>in<br>china the conference gave us all fresh<br>perspective on italian studies and it<br>led to another special issue of modern<br>italy<br>since then several of the speakers that<br>gave papers at the conference have got<br>permanent<br>academic jobs and i expect to see more<br>work on italy and asia as the years go<br>by<br>now one more<br>item in this slight canter through my<br>research work<br>before we get to the final item uh for<br>tonight which is my<br>soul authored my second soul authored<br>book<br>you'll remember that in the early 1980s<br>a relationship like the one i had<br>could be punished with imprisonment in<br>new south wales<br>from the early 2000s we began to see<br>what would have seemed a miracle even in<br>the relatively liberated late 1980s<br>the introduction of civil partnerships<br>for same-sex couples and ultimately<br>from around 2010 onwards 2013 here<br>an extraordinary rash of same-sex<br>again that adage of<br>holding a conference to see what people<br>think of that and what research<br>is being done<br>with the colleague that i'd met at a<br>conference in italy<br>he was at birkbeck university of london<br>sean brady<br>we<br>put together a conference which we<br>provocatively and maybe in retrospect<br>unfortunately titled<br>from sodomy laws to same-sex marriage<br>was very literal quite a brutal title<br>and that was held in london in 2015.<br>my first sydney lecturer robert aldridge<br>was the keynote speaker<br>and sean and i co-edited the selected<br>selected papers into a volume of 17<br>chapters<br>one of which i co-authored with the<br>italian lgbtq activist yuri guyana<br>um<br>and that was that was quite an<br>experience he wasn't a historian i added<br>the historical element but he gave it<br>a political element that i could never<br>and i'll be forever grateful to my<br>erstwhile sadly missed colleague mark<br>stocker<br>from art history who suggested<br>this cover image<br>which is a self-portrait by the 1930s<br>british lesbian artist gluck<br>also known as hannah glockstein<br>and her partner<br>look is the the blonde one and looking<br>at her today i was just thinking she<br>reminds me of somebody<br>and i realized that she reminded me of<br>margaret thatcher<br>probably is not the sort of book<br>that margaret thatcher would like to<br>well the book launch was luxuriously<br>hosted<br>by the sydney law firm of well it's a<br>global law firm but the the sydney<br>branch of herbert smith free hills<br>thanks to my former partner peter<br>now also a partner in said law firm<br>retired high court australia<br>judge michael kirby did the honours<br>and robert aldridge who wrote the<br>conclusion was there too<br>so for all of us in different ways it<br>was something of a full circle<br>that had begun<br>with a road trip to italy in 1986 and if<br>you've forgotten that picture<br>there's a reminder of us looking just a<br>so if that whistle stop tour<br>of some of my research activities over<br>the years<br>seems like too much travel and too many<br>parties<br>let's move to the samba<br>environment of the archive in rome<br>for the long parallel story of my most<br>i took these shots in the reading room<br>of rome's archivio di stato archive of<br>the state<br>known for its middle of nowhere location<br>views of a pet food mega store across<br>the road<br>and immense archival riches<br>we're going back in time<br>a bit here now as you can see<br>from the dates there<br>because although the book that i'm<br>talking about now came out in 2020<br>work on it began in these archives at<br>around the time my first book came out<br>in 2006.<br>it's been a long<br>slow<br>process<br>as it had to take a back seat to other<br>work i've described<br>had a couple of setbacks<br>somebody came out with a book on the<br>exact same subject that i was<br>researching<br>an earthquake not my partner grants and<br>my house over in christchurch<br>but we recovered and the final push on<br>this book<br>came rather speedily and during my<br>research leave of 2019 i wouldn't be<br>able to do this sort of work without<br>those leaves<br>so as tim mentioned the book's title is<br>emotional arenas<br>life love and death in 1870s italy<br>and it's based entirely on one case of<br>spouse murder<br>in 1878<br>that had a two-page bit part<br>in my first book<br>and that information was taken out of<br>back then in 1878 pro divorce activists<br>argued that if italy had a divorce law<br>it would reduce the incidence of spouse<br>murder<br>which unfortunately became known<br>as divorce<br>i thought the story of this particular<br>such murder<br>might make a good next book and i<br>tracked down the prosecution's files<br>for ominous blocks<br>each containing some 500 incredibly hard<br>to read leaves of dusty documents<br>inside however<br>they were pulsating with emotions<br>and with an extraordinary story of life<br>let me tell you about the people<br>involved<br>at least the main characters the the<br>trial called 100 witnesses but i don't<br>have time to go through all of those<br>fascinating as i found them<br>this is of course the prima donna<br>rafaela salacini<br>she was born in calabria in the deep<br>south of italy<br>and in 1871 so 10 years after the formal<br>unification of italy<br>she married giovanni fadder who was from<br>sardinia<br>she was 18 he was about 28.<br>a completely normal sort of marriage<br>so here's fadder<br>he was a good match<br>he was a decorated soldier<br>he had fought in the battles of italian<br>unification in the late<br>1850s he'd volunteered<br>and now<br>he had a secure job with the new italian<br>bureaucracy<br>such a job was much prized a guarantee<br>of income and status for life so they<br>were he was a good catch<br>for rafaela<br>but there was another catch<br>and that is that he had taken a bullet<br>in the groin<br>on one of the during one of those<br>battles<br>and in all likelihood it had made him<br>impotent<br>he may have been an italian hero on the<br>battlefield<br>but as rafaela confided to her<br>hairdresser<br>in 1878 who duly conveyed the<br>information<br>to me<br>he was no hero to her<br>she described him as a useless tool and<br>i have a feeling that something got lost<br>in translation there because<br>what i think she meant was that his tool<br>was useless<br>and i had a fascinating conversation one<br>of the reasons i love being at a<br>university<br>with an anatomist a turkish anatomist i<br>can't quite remember his name<br>and we<br>we looked at the medical records of the<br>the post-mortem on fader and we went<br>through<br>uh the possibilities of the degree of<br>his impairment<br>so<br>what is a woman to do<br>seven years after the wedding<br>separated from her husband who worked in<br>the capital now rome<br>living with her parents in calabria<br>rafaela fell in love with somebody else<br>also we understand so the prosecution<br>argued<br>that man was called<br>pietro cardinali and his profession<br>was circus acrobat<br>more specifically equestrian acrobat<br>i'm sorry not to have a photo of him on<br>his horse<br>but i'm told that he was pretty<br>impressive<br>he was the star<br>of an itinerant circus that pitched up<br>in rafaela's<br>town casano allo yonyo<br>he had an eye for the ladies<br>and they for him by all<br>accounts the prosecutor alleged that<br>rafaela and pietro began an illicit<br>affair<br>so they could legitimize it with<br>marriage they opted<br>for divorce italian style by plotting to<br>murder the hapless fadder<br>after much planning all of which left<br>traces on witnesses minds as well as<br>documentary evidence including telegrams<br>written in indecipherable<br>circus jargon<br>cardinality traveled to rome<br>gained entry to fada's apartment with a<br>decoy letter<br>and immediately stabbed thada 23 times<br>thada died in hospital just near the<br>the trial that followed was an utter<br>media sensation<br>it united italy as no government had<br>been able to do<br>it was followed worldwide<br>including by several new zealand<br>newspapers yes this is 1879 but if you<br>go to papers past and put in the name<br>fada<br>you will see that the otago daily times<br>and many others had stories about him<br>they were a little distorted by the time<br>they arrived here<br>but they're there<br>so i thought here we have the makings of<br>a classic micro history<br>a history that microscopically examines<br>an exceptional incident<br>in an effort to enter the mentalities of<br>the time<br>and get a better understanding of things<br>that might not otherwise come<br>such as the sorts of letters<br>that women admirers of circus acrobats<br>wrote to him in secret<br>as i sifted through the two thousand odd<br>documents<br>what most struck me in fact was the huge<br>range of sentiments and feelings<br>that seemed to emanate from those<br>fragile pages<br>here is a sample of the personal<br>correspondence between the main cast<br>and others including several anonymous<br>very carefully anonymized women<br>most of their letters were about how the<br>letter would be passed on by so-and-so<br>and such and such code names the<br>the sub<br>the subterfuge to to avoid uh identity<br>these were all tracked down uh by the<br>police quite efficient for police in<br>italy in 1878 as evidence for the murder<br>trial<br>but to my historians eyes<br>130 130 years later<br>they were still oozing with love with<br>lust with malice<br>with boredom with frustration<br>but the french cultural theorists who<br>dominated the interpretation of personal<br>letters in the late 1990s and early<br>2000s<br>warned me<br>and i'd fully heeded their warnings that<br>the emotions i wanted to discern in the<br>letters<br>were largely culturally determined and<br>most definitely not to be taken simply<br>as historical traces<br>these insights taught me a lot but i<br>also pushed against them i resisted<br>them and i asked myself i started asking<br>myself if emotions might have traceable<br>histories<br>as my travels had taught me as my life<br>in new zealand had taught me<br>the way emotions are felt and expressed<br>certainly change<br>from place to place<br>so i asked does time<br>have a role in those changes too can<br>i was not by any means the first person<br>or historian to ask that question<br>and i began to look into the most recent<br>historiography of emotions<br>which had recently begun to thrive<br>around the early 21st century<br>so i discovered that the history of the<br>emotions was a thing<br>since last late last century scholars<br>such as peter stearns william reddy<br>thomas dixon<br>barbara rosenwein to name some of the<br>most prominent<br>have pioneered an emotional turn in<br>history and historical scholarship<br>analytical concepts like emotional<br>styles emotional regimes emotional<br>refuges<br>and emotional communities<br>have all helped historians to<br>reconstitute<br>if not reconstruct elements of the<br>emotional life of the past<br>i decided to write the fatter story as a<br>contribution to the history<br>as well as dozens of letters and<br>hundreds of pages of personal testimony<br>from police interviews<br>i read numerous contemporary newspaper<br>accounts of the murder<br>and subsequent trial<br>newspaper editors have discovered that<br>emotions sell newspapers<br>their reports all evoked landscapes of<br>rich emotions whether marital rouse or<br>lonely remorse<br>or the blood-curdling drama of the<br>murder itself of fatter by cardinali<br>or public determination to hear the<br>story unfold firsthand<br>it was the physical spatial dimension of<br>the courtroom<br>that prompted me to develop the idea of<br>emotional arenas<br>it became clear that in the novel<br>social space of the courtroom<br>only made accessible to the public in<br>italy a few years earlier<br>the public did not know how to comport<br>themselves emotionally in this new<br>public space<br>faced with a spicy story like this the<br>public in the courtroom often behaved<br>as if they were at the theater<br>watching an opera<br>they treated it as entertainment<br>they expressed their emotions openly<br>in sighs shouts<br>haras<br>despite the ushers and judges best<br>efforts<br>this became a real danger to the<br>legitimacy of the legal arena in a a<br>nation that has yet only had fragile<br>authority<br>it was a particular risk when the trial<br>was of a circus acrobat who'd murdered a<br>ward war hero in order to steal his wife<br>with circus clowns and a donkey trainer<br>being called as witnesses<br>the donkey trainer was the expert<br>on circus jargon and he was called to<br>translate<br>the the<br>the telegrams which was very helpful to<br>me<br>but in short what we have here in the<br>court of law of rome<br>is a bit of a circus<br>some contemporary journalists even<br>complained that the crowd in the court<br>behaved as if they were ancient romans<br>watching wild beasts devour christians<br>in the great coliseum<br>a few yards from where father was<br>murdered<br>there was a great<br>there was a great deal of debate<br>pontificating<br>about the proper degree of emotion<br>that should be felt and expressed in<br>artists even memorialized the court uh<br>the port the the fader trial with<br>paintings this one by francesco nettie<br>being the most famous<br>note that the audience was predominantly<br>women<br>and that refreshments were being served<br>both were cause for scandal<br>should such emotionally susceptible<br>beings be permitted to participate in<br>such scandalous processes people asked<br>emotions had become political<br>and this event allowed me to trace how<br>that happened<br>i developed the term emotional arenas as<br>a modest contribution<br>to the subject using the social space<br>idea as an organizing principle<br>each chapter covers a distinct social<br>emotional arena such as the marital home<br>the circus<br>the secret virtual arena of love letters<br>rituals around death<br>and of course the emotional climax in<br>the courtroom<br>itself<br>cardinality was sentenced to death<br>rafaela to life with hard labor even<br>though she was 400 kilometers away when<br>the murder took place she was considered<br>to have been crucial to the crime<br>and this was<br>an artist's impression of the moment the<br>sentences<br>the context of 1870s italy suggested to<br>me<br>that when new institutions emerge such<br>as liberal regimes<br>often bringing in their wake new styles<br>of social space such as public<br>courtrooms<br>historians can use those changes to<br>analyze bends in the road<br>of the history of emotions<br>and that's what i've tried to do<br>so i will begin<br>to wind down here<br>with some thanks<br>to my colleagues<br>i can't name<br>too many people but i would like to<br>mention brian malotny who was my<br>savior and mentor at otago very early on<br>and the heads of department who've been<br>who've given me so much support and<br>advice<br>barbara brooks tony valentine takashi<br>shorgymen and john stenhouse<br>and it's a source of great pleasure<br>that you are all in this auditorium<br>today<br>i'd also like to express<br>heartfelt thanks to all my friends<br>colleagues and the general staff who<br>make otago university a wonderful<br>community<br>my proxy for an extended italian family<br>but permit me uh a prologue in in a more<br>the world i grew up in<br>has been buckling<br>and twisting markedly since 2016<br>the year of brexit and donald trump's<br>election<br>a couple of months ago after watching a<br>sunday morning q a that examined china's<br>bid for influence in the pacific<br>at the time of foreign minister wang<br>yi's tour<br>i had a vivid sense that the age of the<br>neo-liberal global economy and the<br>geopolitical framework in which it<br>operated<br>are coming to a close before our very<br>eyes<br>this is not even to mention the ukraine<br>looking back<br>i see the ideal of capitalism tempered<br>by social democracy and decolonization<br>which lasted from<br>1945 to 1980 to choose some round dates<br>followed by a 10-year interval in which<br>the consolidating hegemony of<br>neoliberalism was crowned with the<br>collapse<br>of the berlin wall<br>now it seems to me that that age too<br>is coming to a close after approximately<br>35 years<br>in the emerging geopolitical<br>power struggle<br>poppers<br>and powers open societies<br>find themselves somewhat on the back<br>foot<br>if the far right fratelli d'italia<br>wins italy's elections in one month's<br>time today the 25th of september<br>it will be a haunting bellwether<br>the first time a party with genealogical<br>roots in interwar fascism has won power<br>in western europe since world war ii<br>they're highly likely to do so<br>these are the waves on which i feel like<br>a little pork and i sometimes struggle<br>to remain convinced of the value of my<br>research as a historian<br>after all the concept of the personal is<br>political powerful and important that is<br>as it is<br>is itself the product of a very<br>particular era in history<br>one in which i had the privilege to come<br>of age<br>however much<br>history changes course in the coming<br>years<br>what i will remember most about my<br>career<br>is teaching tomorrow's citizens and<br>leaders what my teachers of history<br>taught me<br>how to see the depth and perspective<br>the personal and political and so on<br>so i hope they will use these ideas and<br>others in shaping what we hope will be a<br>long future<br>thank you students past present and<br>future<br>long live history grazia<br>it's my great pleasure here as the pvc<br>of the humanities division to kita<br>aranui to offer the vote of thanks at<br>the end<br>unfortunately when i was faced with this<br>task and looking at the speakers that<br>came before me i thought it might be a<br>little bit disconcerting for me and a<br>real letdown for you that i was the only<br>non-historian to provide a speech<br>tonight on the other hand<br>and perhaps it's only right that it's<br>the lawyer who gets to pass judgment<br>on the lecture<br>i think law is very much in part a sort<br>of applied history and i think mark's<br>presentation tonight and the story of<br>his research shows that to be so and it<br>warmed my heart in particular to hear<br>that you spent years in the records of<br>parliamentary debates for your phd<br>and that a criminal case was the<br>catalyst for your second book<br>and and nothing like having some lawyer<br>friends to provide the drinks for your<br>conference good move<br>but in in seriousness professor seymour<br>has highlighted for us what humanities<br>scholars do well<br>they interpret and reinterpret the world<br>around us they show us the layers of<br>meaning and the necessity and the joy of<br>asking questions<br>and in mark's case he has shown us how<br>important it is to do that patiently and<br>with perseverance<br>and his reflections on his research<br>journey have demonstrated the<br>significance of place and time<br>but also of mark's own flexibility and<br>his openness to ideas<br>his early days as a developing historian<br>were influenced by emerging schools of<br>thought including gender history and<br>cultural history<br>as well as by significant world events<br>and errors the cold war<br>the battle for and against nuclear power<br>perhaps even the rise and fall of the<br>citroen<br>and then spending the large part of his<br>career as a scholar of italian history<br>in new zealand of all places has<br>affected the shape and ideas of his<br>writing and he's borrowed from the<br>corridor and the culture in new zealand<br>to shed light on the italian context on<br>subjects of masculinity same-sex<br>marriage<br>and i think touchingly in his epilogue<br>professor seymour is brave enough<br>to ask whether his research has had any<br>value<br>as we watch the ways of time and<br>geopolitical movements pass over us<br>and thankfully and rightfully<br>i would respectfully add<br>you conclude that it does<br>and i think well done to that<br>so<br>mark i i wanted to say too that<br>what was really evident in your ipl<br>in amongst all of this wonderful stuff<br>and the skill and expertise that you<br>show<br>you demonstrate great humility for your<br>own achievements and great gratitude to<br>the people around you<br>and that's what makes you a wonderful<br>colleague and so bravo<br>despite my own interests i'm glad that<br>you resisted the temptation to retrain<br>in law<br>i think we would have been all the<br>poorer for that<br>and i hope that while this is not italy<br>aotearoa and otago have nevertheless<br>offered you<br>some sort of dolce vita<br>we are grateful for what you have given<br>us mag here at otago<br>namahinui tamahi<br>motif<br>i have the great pleasure of presenting<br>you with a very small gift as a token of<br>our appreciation<br>and to all of you here with us in person<br>and to those of you online a huge thank<br>you from us the university leadership<br>for attending either in spirit or in a<br>person<br>hi demai<br>and particularly for those of you who<br>are here this evening<br>we welcome you and invite you to come<br>and join some kaput sorry i started<br>speaking in maori in the middle of an<br>english sentence<br>let's do it in maori<br>um<br>so thank you all very much please come<br>to the staff club with us to enjoy some<br>food and drinks and to celebrate mark<br>with his family tonight<br>please do come it's a wee way over there<br>don't stop here the evening continues<br>but please do come and congratulate mark<br>thank you all very much for coming<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
