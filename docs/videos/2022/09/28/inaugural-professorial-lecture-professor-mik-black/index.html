vice<br>chancellor who sadly can't be with us<br>and the wider University it's my<br>pleasure to welcome you all to this<br>special occasion to celebrate Mick<br>Black's promotion to Professor<br>and it's great to see so many of Mick's<br>colleagues students and friends here<br>tonight<br>but I'd like to give a special welcome<br>to Amex whanau his wife Mel<br>his son's Liam and Kieran his mum Elaine<br>and sister Susie and Bob and Julianne<br>his parents-in-law who've all traveled<br>to Dunedin for this special occasion<br>it's really lovely that you can join us<br>and welcome and a big welcome to to<br>those of you who are watching online no<br>my haremai<br>so inaugural professorial lectures are<br>always wonderful opportunities for us to<br>celebrate and learn about the special<br>journeys of our outstanding colleagues<br>as they've made their way to become<br>professors<br>in a minute Professor matissue Smith's<br>going to give a formal welcome to a<br>formal introduction to Mick<br>but Mick I just wanted to personally<br>congratulate you<br>um and for the rest of you in my<br>previous roles as dean of the school of<br>biomedical sciences and as a member of<br>the board of New Zealand genomics<br>Limited<br>I've at times worked quite closely with<br>Nick<br>nzgl has some people know was a company<br>that was set up to provide both Gene<br>sequencing and bioinformatics which is<br>making sense of the sequencing data that<br>comes out<br>and it was set up to provide this<br>service for all researchers across the<br>model<br>um<br>as any setting up of any company<br>and as we developed the company it<br>wasn't always plain sailing not least<br>because we were trying to manage<br>resources and Facilities across three<br>universities<br>and during that time<br>make your sense of enthusiasm and<br>positivity<br>and the way that you your willingness<br>just to make things happen I really<br>appreciated so thank you for your<br>support and your leadership at that time<br>so Mick it's been a pleasure for me to<br>work with you and congratulations on<br>your well-deserved promotion so now I'll<br>hand over to Elisa telecota tanakoto<br>tenakotakata<br>my name is Lisa Madison Smith and I am<br>the current acting dean of the school of<br>biomedical Sciences so as Helen said I<br>have the honor of being able to<br>introduce Mick to you tonight most of<br>you of course don't require an<br>introduction but I get to give a bit of<br>background<br>on Mech so<br>um Mick received his BSC in 1997 from<br>the University of Canterbury and then<br>took off to the great state of Indiana<br>to undertake his master's and PhD at<br>Purdue University receiving his MSC in<br>mathematical statistics in 2000 and his<br>PhD in statistics in 2002 and I had to<br>convince had to confess to Mick tonight<br>I always had to kind of keep you know<br>stalking his research outputs and so<br>forth because both my parents are Purdue<br>graduates and my father found out went<br>to a lecture that that Mick had given<br>where I was also speaking and and Dad<br>heard that Mick was was a Purdue Purdue<br>grad so it was always you know has that<br>how's Purdue Mick going how's Purdue<br>what's Purdue Mick up to so<br>um I mean I I have been lucky enough to<br>be able to to be on PhD committees and<br>things with mixo I could sure Dad that<br>the University of otago was very lucky<br>to have Purdue Mick on on our staff so<br>as you've heard Mick is indeed a<br>bioinformatician or a statistician whose<br>research focuses on the development of<br>methods for the analysis of genomic data<br>with a strong emphasis on cancer and<br>other human diseases common theme is the<br>use of techniques that allow High<br>dimensional and often very desperate<br>data sets to be combined in ways that<br>provide new insights into disease<br>development and progression<br>This research is highly collaborative<br>and and I can certainly attest to that<br>working on projects that that Mick has<br>been involved with and he works with a<br>number of otago research groups as well<br>as long-standing National and<br>international collaborations the<br>University of Auckland The Institute of<br>environmental science and research Wake<br>Forest University Medical School Moffitt<br>Cancer Center so in addition to his own<br>work Mick has been heavily involved as<br>we heard in establishing National<br>research infrastructure and high<br>performance computing<br>uh through the NZ e-science<br>infrastructure and in genomics and<br>bioinformatics through genomics where he<br>is the chair of the bioinformatics<br>leadership team so I work with genomic<br>data I generate genomic data I'm in awe<br>of bioinformatists I was part of the<br>generation that could like look at your<br>data by eye and kind of identify<br>relationships somewhere along past that<br>so<br>um you know indebted to<br>bioinformaticians like like Mick but<br>what makes Mick really I think<br>particularly impressive is that not only<br>is he a brilliant statistician but he's<br>a great person and really easy to work<br>with and you know that<br>sadly not all bioinformaticians are so<br>easy<br>you understand the real data and issues<br>so anyway<br>um Mick is<br>presenting his his talk tonight uh<br>genomics by the number adventures in the<br>data verse so<br>again a little bit of History makes<br>introduction to genomics came just as<br>his PhD and she began as PhD when it<br>became apparent that statistical<br>methodology provided an invaluable<br>toolkit for analyzing the vast volumes<br>of biological data being generated by<br>new high throughput Technologies fast<br>forward 25 years and the same statement<br>holds true<br>so technology continues to advance the<br>size and complexity of data sets<br>continue to grow and Analysis of high<br>dimensional data remains a key component<br>of modern genomic research<br>so the analysis of large-scale genomic<br>data sets has been a central feature and<br>makes highly collaborative research<br>career and this lecture he will take the<br>opportunity to focus on some of those<br>highlights as well as thank many of the<br>individuals who've helped make the<br>journey both successful and fun what<br>list of organisms and diseases that mix<br>research encompasses is Broad his<br>primary focus remains cancer genomics<br>and is he's passionate about using data<br>informed genomic research to improve<br>outcomes for cancer patients<br>in addition to his research work Mick<br>has also been involved in a number of<br>major as we talked about National<br>infrastructure initiatives so<br>um<br>I'm at this point going to hand over to<br>the person we've all come to here<br>tonight and congratulations Mick and we<br>and welcome<br>wow thank you thank you all for coming<br>that's good people came<br>um hello to the online folks I know<br>there are some people watching online<br>there may even be some people watching<br>online later<br>um thank you very much Professor<br>Nicholson Professor Madison Smith for a<br>lovely introduction and really special<br>to have you guys here<br>um as part of this and Sally and Neil<br>too um you guys have been amazing<br>friends and colleagues for so many years<br>now and I'm glad you lit the the nzgl uh<br>cat out of the bag really we'll get to<br>that part of the story later on and so<br>to start with let's start with a couple<br>of facts<br>so first off I am a statistician this<br>has been pointed out and<br>um what is slightly strange is that I'm<br>a statistician that lives in a<br>biochemistry Department uh which that<br>trust me that is quite strange not just<br>about the department<br>we'll get to that later<br>so what I'm going to try and do is um<br>through this lecture explain to you how<br>this has happened and how I've ended up<br>starting off on a statistical path but<br>ending up in a very different place<br>so when you're young<br>there are endless possibilities right so<br>you start school and you don't have to<br>pick there are so many things to choose<br>from it's a smorgasbord<br>um considered fishermen<br>was it was an option<br>Soccer Star doesn't really look like<br>that was ever on the cards<br>superhero I would have loved it it would<br>have been spectacular long distance<br>running the um the venerated Clifton<br>Terrace Primary School long distance<br>running team was probably never really<br>going to uh to go too far<br>luckily however<br>um you don't have to figure out back<br>then you've got a lot of time to figure<br>it out and uh when I started to figure<br>out what I wanted to do with my life and<br>it was actually at nalen College in<br>Nelson where I grew up and some of it<br>actually happened in this room right<br>here which was um where I had my sixth<br>form statistics class and what happened<br>one Sunday afternoon near the start of<br>the year is our<br>um our teacher uh Mr John Walker took us<br>all outside and what he said was bring<br>your pins and pencils and and uh come<br>out and there was a tree I don't think<br>it's that tree I think they've remodeled<br>the front of the school I think the tree<br>was actually over here I could have just<br>told you it was that treat but it was a<br>tree what we did with the tree is we<br>measured the lengths of leaves on the<br>tree so we measured hundreds of these<br>things so we wrote them all down and<br>then we took them back inside once Mr<br>Walker had enough time in the sun I took<br>them back inside and he went to the<br>chalkboard and in those days it was a<br>chalkboard okay it was a chalk and he<br>drew a big long line and what he asked<br>us to do is he asked us to call out the<br>links of the leaves that we'd measured<br>and we started calling them out and it<br>would put them on the Blackboard kind of<br>in the order that they appeared and so<br>the short ones would be down at one end<br>the long ones would be the other end and<br>all the middle ones would be in the<br>middle and they kind of built up and<br>they formed the shape and the shape that<br>they formed as you probably know because<br>I put a picture of it was the normal<br>distribution and it was an almost<br>perfect normal distribution from<br>collecting these hundreds of leaf lanes<br>and for me that was amazing that was the<br>first time I'd seen an example of one of<br>these theoretical distributions being<br>able to represent the data that we'd<br>gone out and collect<br>collected<br>what I was also quite intrigued by was<br>that you could create that distribution<br>with a mathematical formula so you could<br>actually use that mathematical formula<br>down the bottom there to draw that<br>method that um that normal distribution<br>which for you know 16 year old just<br>getting started with a bit of math was<br>pretty exciting<br>so with that in mind with that kind of<br>General enthusiasm for statistics I went<br>off to University and I did a lot of<br>things at University<br>um one of them was statistics but by my<br>third year I was I was pretty focused on<br>maths and stats and at that time I<br>encountered these two individuals so<br>they taught the two stats courses um<br>that were on and in third year they were<br>full length four-year courses so you did<br>an entire year in the same course and so<br>professor John Daley was the chair of<br>Statistics at um at Canterbury at the<br>time and uh Dr Frank Ladd was a senior<br>lecturer in the department Frank was<br>writing a book uh while I was a student<br>there and Frank actually used his<br>lectures basically as a way to test run<br>the material in his book so we did the<br>exercises found the typos and learned<br>all the stuff that he was putting in<br>there and it was an interesting book and<br>because it was actually teaching from a<br>very different perspective what's called<br>a Bayesian perspective in statistics<br>which is not the sort of thing you would<br>normally teach to undergraduate students<br>and but stayed at Canterbury at that<br>time was was unusual<br>uh and extremely fun John characterizes<br>the idea of Bayesian statistics um with<br>a with a great quote uh he says all<br>uncertainty in a problem can be<br>characterized by a distribution so just<br>like the the normal the normal<br>distribution we saw before and we can<br>collect data it will follow a<br>distribution and we can also assign<br>probabilities and those will follow<br>distributions as well and we put all<br>those distributions together into a<br>mathematical model and we can solve that<br>and get a better understanding of what<br>our data are telling us<br>now a way to do that to do the<br>computational work to solve the problem<br>had been proposed a few years earlier in<br>this Landmark paper which defined the<br>What's called the Gibbs sampler and<br>another unusual thing to be teaching<br>undergraduates at the time John Daly was<br>teaching us how the Gib sampler worked<br>in the mid 90s and we were going into<br>the computer lab and programming that in<br>Matlab and solving these very complex<br>statistical problems that actually<br>before this methodology had been<br>developed really weren't able to be<br>solved and so that was exciting for me<br>being able to go write some computer<br>code and solve a statistical problem<br>now around that time and I hope<br>Richard's watching uh from Christchurch<br>I'll give him a wave just in case he is<br>around that time and one of my other<br>lecturers Murray Smith<br>um uh introduced me to Richard Jones who<br>had a summer project at Christchurch<br>Hospital uh looking at uh what are<br>called electron encephalograms so when<br>they put electrodes all over a patient's<br>head and they record back on those days<br>it was a 16 channel recording so 16<br>electrodes on your head recording the<br>electrical activity from the brain and<br>what Richard's team had done was develop<br>an automated system a computer-based<br>system for reading these eegs so here's<br>the the EEG traces now that's one page<br>these things came in a big book so the<br>clinicians would look through pages and<br>pages and Pages looking for<br>um this this typical epileptiform<br>activity which would indicate abnormal<br>brain activity in the in the patient<br>what Richard was wanting to do was to<br>compare the performance of the system so<br>the system could say there's no activity<br>there's questionable activity there's<br>definite abnormal activity against how<br>those expert clinicians um we do you can<br>see there already that it's not perfect<br>agreement was perfect agreement everyone<br>agreed on the diagonal so sometimes the<br>system would detect something the<br>experts wouldn't sometimes the experts<br>would detect something the system<br>wouldn't and so what my project became<br>was to uh to perform an analysis to see<br>how good that system was doing<br>and that actually resulted in some of my<br>first Publications uh conference<br>proceedings a letter which has been<br>cited twice one of the times I think was<br>by us and then finally um<br>a clinical study that was actually<br>evaluating the performance of that<br>system<br>um they'd also found the basis for my<br>honors project and my fourth year and at<br>the same time I found in the medical<br>library at uh at otago at Christchurch<br>hospital and the med school this paper<br>here which had been published the year<br>before and the American Journal of<br>epidemiology and I took the methodology<br>from that and it made its way into my<br>honors thesis and my honest thesis went<br>quite well um I passed my exams and I<br>passed my honors thesis and I graduated<br>um there was my parents at the<br>graduation in 1997 at Canterbury and<br>their paper though oh here's John at his<br>retirement uh wearing his um twirly<br>propeller beanie hat that we gave him<br>and when he retired at Canterbury and<br>we'll hear a little bit more about that<br>later and<br>their paper actually utilized the the<br>methodology that John had taught us the<br>Gib sampler methodology and to build a<br>model<br>that I will not be going through and<br>Sally was looking worried<br>which would build a model and build on<br>based on distributions that would<br>explain the uncertainty into diagnostic<br>tests so two diagnostic tests that would<br>test for the presence of a parasitic<br>infection it would say positive or<br>negative and neither of them was a gold<br>standard each of them would miss some<br>things and so this was a mechanism for<br>understanding the performance of those<br>two tests and combining all the<br>information and getting an estimate of<br>the disease prevalence what I was able<br>to do and was to take that methodology<br>reproduce it on the on my computer in<br>the in the lab and reproduce their<br>results so I knew that what I was doing<br>was actually right because it agreed<br>with what they're done and then extend<br>that so that it was able to cope with<br>our three level system our<br>non-questionable and indefinite from<br>coming from that um that EEG reading<br>machine so that we could then put the<br>EEG data in there and the expert data<br>and use this methodology to understand<br>the performance and which wasn't a bad<br>effort for a fourth year student and um<br>when I handed them my thesis it was<br>marked and everything and then I can<br>remember Murray uh coming to me in the<br>in the hallway one day at the at the<br>stats department and saying that that um<br>that thesis you wrote that was um that<br>was quite good so thanks Murray thanks<br>really nice of you and he said um you<br>might want to think about doing a PhD I<br>said oh oh really and then he said you<br>might want to think about doing it<br>overseas<br>and so I didn't really think too much<br>about it but I I mulled it over<br>um and then through an interesting chain<br>of events<br>um I actually headed off to Purdue<br>University I didn't go alone I admit Mel<br>um by this time and we'd gotten married<br>and it turned out that Mel was actually<br>very clever and Mel was also going to do<br>a PhD um so it worked out quite well we<br>both get into Purdue uh to do a PhD she<br>did not toward PhD incident I was<br>actually a PhD in neurobiology and the<br>building for that is slightly off screen<br>and what you're looking at is part of<br>the Purdue campus and this part here is<br>where the stats Department was based<br>when I was there so I actually had an<br>office up here on the the 10th floor of<br>the uh the big maths and stats building<br>now when I arrived it was a time of<br>change Mary Ellen Bach had just taken<br>over as the as the head of Department of<br>Statistics there and that was after<br>Professor Shanti Gupta had stepped down<br>after a tenure of 27 years as head of<br>department so Sally your three-year term<br>as head of biochem is probably not<br>looking too shabby right now and<br>Professor group stayed on and he taught<br>me while while I was there<br>um and also at that time<br>there were some new faculty arriving<br>Rebecca Deutsch had and had arrived in<br>1995 and Rebecca became my PhD advisor<br>once I qualified to do a PhD and Bruce<br>Craig had also arrived not long after<br>and so they were both young and Keen<br>statistical faculty and then this<br>character over in the corner John dealy<br>had had retired from Canterbury at age<br>65 and immediately taken up a lecturing<br>position at Purdue uh which was his alma<br>mater he'd actually done his PhD with<br>Professor Gupta about 30 years earlier<br>and so John was lecturing there to first<br>year stat students when I arrived to<br>start my PhD in 1997. and he did that<br>for many many years afterwards<br>everything started off well<br>um I started off actually as a research<br>assistant working with Bruce and what we<br>actually were working one of the things<br>we're working on was actually extending<br>the model that I developed at uh at um<br>in my Christchurch hospital and using it<br>or using the dependencies between tests<br>to get a better estimate of prevalence<br>so he we changed the model so we<br>actually estimate uh how strong a<br>dependence there was between the tests<br>like if one test is positive the other<br>one's more likely to say positive that<br>sort of thing and we've got a really<br>nice publication out of that actually it<br>took a long time to happen and since<br>medicine I was very um very satisfying<br>one it was a very complex mathematical<br>one which again I'm not going to explain<br>and so at that point the trajectory was<br>was pretty standard lots of Statistics<br>work and going on lots of complex<br>mathematics<br>and then suddenly I got a little bit<br>blindsided and Along Came something<br>called genomics<br>and um it came along at least for me in<br>the form of what's called what are<br>called gene expression microarrays and<br>this was a a really exciting and uh in<br>the groundbreaking technology that let<br>us measure the activity levels of every<br>Gene in the genome in a single<br>experiment and so what what that means<br>is I could take a sample I couldn't<br>because I'm a statistician and someone<br>could take a sample say of a leaf and<br>they could do some laboratory magic put<br>that magic material onto a microarray<br>and what we could find out was how much<br>activity how much was each gene turned<br>on within that plant sample in in this<br>particular situation and so that would<br>allow us to compare different situations<br>um across say different plants exposed<br>to different treatments how it worked<br>um was by capturing<br>um what's called messenger RNA so when a<br>cell needs to make a protein what it<br>does it says oh I have instructions for<br>that somewhere let me have a look the<br>instructions are stored in the DNA with<br>than the cell nucleus it makes a copy of<br>those instructions in the messenger RNA<br>sends it outside the nucleus to what<br>Warren Tate has told me is the most<br>important component of the cell the<br>ribosome and there it is translated into<br>protein so what what micro erase it is<br>they capture that intermediate product<br>they captured that messenger RNA and<br>that was uh fixed to um to these these<br>arrays and the readout that you got<br>would tell you what the activity levels<br>were for every single Gene within that<br>sample<br>and what that meant was there were a lot<br>of numbers right so all of these little<br>colored dots were turned into numbers<br>and we had to figure out what to do with<br>them<br>the the way in which I encountered this<br>was through Rebecca uh calling him into<br>her office one day and she actually had<br>a paper copy of Science magazine and she<br>spread it out on her dish and she'd look<br>at this and what I was looking at was I<br>was looking at that picture I was<br>looking at the entire Genome of yeast<br>um in a gene expression experiment so<br>um the gene activity of every single<br>Gene in the yeast genome over a period<br>of 11 hours for a particular<br>developmental cycle in yeast and what<br>we're looking at here is each tiny<br>little little Thin Line the air<br>represents one Gene and in green we're<br>looking at genes whose activity<br>decreased over time and in red we're<br>looking at genes whose activity<br>increased over time<br>and this was incredible because you'd<br>never been able to see a readout like<br>this before on a whole genome scale<br>the way in which these things are<br>grouped uh in terms of all the green<br>ones being together and all the red ones<br>being together statistical methodology<br>was used to do that and there was a<br>couple of graduate students ahead of me<br>who are working on that sort of thing<br>what we were more interested in working<br>on at the time<br>um was thinking about how you could<br>Define how you could design efficient<br>micro experience these things are quite<br>expensive so what was the most efficient<br>way to design these things and how do we<br>analyze that data once we've done it<br>Bruce Craig in particular was very<br>interested in the design aspects of<br>micro experiments<br>so I'm back on a PhD we did a lot of<br>work in terms of<br>developing statistical methodologies for<br>analyzing these these types of<br>experiments and my PhD was funded by a<br>initial Science Foundation at plant<br>genomics Grant so a very large<br>infrastructure research Grant and plant<br>genomics until the pis on that one of<br>them was Rebecca George my PhD<br>supervisor and another one was Rob<br>attention from Cold Spring Harbor and so<br>there's a picture of Rob there in his<br>element in the field I'm pictured with<br>Barbara McClintock who was his mentor at<br>uh called Spring Harbor Barbara<br>McClintock got the um got the Nobel<br>Prize for her discovery of transposable<br>elements also known as jumping genes so<br>genes which are able to excise<br>themselves from the DNA of their genome<br>and randomly reinsert themselves<br>somewhere else in the genome and what<br>Rob's experiment uh was doing the the<br>experiment that generated the data we<br>were looking at was actually looking at<br>these transposable elements these<br>jumping genes in arabidopsis and so Rob<br>had a um uh a what we call a wild type<br>arabidopsis strain and a mutant and this<br>mutant had a particular characteristic<br>and it was deficient in a gene that<br>enabled what's called DNA methylation<br>and we're not going to get too much into<br>the the um how all that works<br>um but very very briefly<br>um<br>what Rob showed was that uh in the in<br>the wild type arabidopsis you saw<br>standard levels or high levels of<br>methylation so particular changes to the<br>DNA uh that would do things I'm not<br>going to tell you about<br>um but in the mutant variety you saw<br>that methylation removed okay so a<br>removal of that methylation a removal of<br>these changes to the DNA and what<br>resulted from that was increased<br>activity of genes in that region where<br>the where the methylation had been<br>removed you can see here the wild type<br>is not really exhibiting much activity a<br>lot more happening in the in the<br>decreased DNA mutilation mutant and<br>those genes were those um were those<br>jumping genes those transposable<br>elements and so what Rob was really<br>doing was helping us understand the<br>relationship between what's called<br>heterochromatin so very tightly wound<br>and controlled chromatin they're tightly<br>controlled DNA and the relationship with<br>that methylation and transposable<br>elements in the genome and some things<br>that I'm not showing you behind the<br>great output there and this was an<br>amazing paper it's incredibly well cited<br>we where you will find my contribution<br>is the supplementary information which<br>is all the boring bits of how the<br>analysis was done under the hood and so<br>this we were applying linear models<br>approach that we developed and removing<br>experimental artifacts doing<br>normalization estimating the genetic<br>effects and doing all the things that we<br>we think of as really standard now like<br>hypothesis testing and multiple<br>comparison Corrections and this was all<br>brand new stuff at the time and so that<br>was the the what was going on uh in my<br>PhD thesis which ended<br>um rather well<br>and I had an examination there's me at<br>my actual thesis defense in 2002 with<br>slides projected from an overhead<br>projector and Mel and I graduated in the<br>same ceremony very soon after that our<br>families came to visit us in the US and<br>so families there and you see John and<br>his wife Anne in the background there<br>and Rob Martinson and Rebecca they're<br>all of us very happy to be graduated and<br>celebrating uh basically our wonderful<br>five years there and then we both got<br>jobs at the University of Auckland and<br>there I am in my first day on the job in<br>the department of statistics and my<br>flash new office with my flash computers<br>uh feeling very much like a grown-up<br>with a real job<br>and it was a really exciting time at the<br>University of Auckland uh so um Ellen<br>Rodrigo was in the process I think of<br>being made professor of bioinformatics<br>and he was setting up the The<br>bioinformatics Institute there and he<br>was also setting up the bioinformatics<br>teaching program and so a big part of<br>what I was doing was helping Alan set<br>that up and and and put some of the<br>graduate courses in place there I met<br>this guy called Chris so Chris print<br>many of you will know Chris arrived at<br>Auckland in I think it was 2004 and I<br>was just blown away by what he'd done<br>he'd been doing some amazing work in<br>terms of reconstructing Gene regulatory<br>networks from micronary data and we<br>became pretty much instant friends and<br>collaborators at that point uh he just<br>done some wonderful stuff and my the<br>time I was working on um on really just<br>extending the work I'd done in that my<br>career space and starting to work with<br>researchers in New Zealand who are using<br>microarrays and then I got a phone call<br>I got a phone call from from Robin North<br>who was an obstetrician and gynecologist<br>at um at Auckland hospital and also a<br>clinical researcher at the University of<br>Auckland and with Professor Leslie<br>McCown she was putting together uh what<br>was called the scope study and scope was<br>screening for pregnancy endpoints and<br>what that study was all about was<br>looking at three uh very um very harmful<br>conditions in pregnancy pre-eclampsia<br>spontaneous pre-term birth and babies<br>that are small for gestational age and<br>what they wanted to do was be able to<br>identify risk factors for first-time<br>mothers so that we could figure out<br>which women were at high risk of<br>developing these conditions<br>um so the the um the issue is that<br>particularly for preeclampsia the best<br>predictor of preeclampsia and pregnancy<br>is whether you had preeclampsia in your<br>previous pregnancy<br>um which is not a particularly good<br>predictor for a first-time mother so we<br>were looking at other clinical<br>measurements that were taken to see if<br>we could come up with a predictive model<br>so that we could identify these<br>high-risk women and I want to highlight<br>this was an absolutely Landmark<br>international study it was lead from New<br>Zealand by Liz and Robin uh Alan Rigo<br>became involved once it got underway but<br>eventually it included five sites<br>internationally and recruited over five<br>and a half thousand women and their<br>babies as part of the study<br>there's a huge number of Publications<br>that came out of it over 100 out of the<br>entire scope um scope study these are<br>some of the ones that I was involved in<br>the big one for us was really that<br>publication and bmj the British medical<br>journal which was looking at developing<br>a predictive model for preeclampsia and<br>um there was a huge amount of work that<br>went into this and Robin and I spent a<br>ridiculous amount of time on this and<br>what we were able to do is really say<br>this is as good as you can do we could<br>come up with the stratification system<br>that would stratify women into low or<br>high-risk groups you could move between<br>low and high risk depending on the<br>results of some blood tests so not<br>Sublime sorry some blood pressure<br>measurements or interuterine dopplers<br>during your pregnancy and but it would<br>allow the women that were in that high<br>gross high risk group to have more<br>intensive monitoring during their<br>pregnancy so that if there was any um<br>any signs detected of anything adverse<br>like maybe I'm starting to develop<br>preeclampsia then it was much easier to<br>do a pick up early and do a clinical<br>intervention if needed so this was a a<br>really big paper that came out of scope<br>and it's um it's had a pretty big impact<br>in clinical practice as well<br>there was some stuff going on at the<br>other end of the country as well<br>so around that time I met Tony Reeve and<br>what Tony had been doing was working<br>with a surgeon called professor John<br>McCall who many of you will know and<br>another guy called Perry Guilford and<br>what they've done Perry was the chief<br>scientific officer at Pacific Edge<br>biotech back then what they've been<br>doing on Tony's very large HRC program<br>Grant was using microarrays to profile<br>colorectal Cancers and so just like we'd<br>done in my PhD with Rob where Rob was<br>looking at gene activity and plants Tony<br>and Perry and John and their team were<br>looking at gene activity in tumors after<br>the tumor had been removed by surgery<br>when people were diagnosed with cancer<br>so there were two cohorts available<br>there were 149 tumors from New Zealand<br>most of them from Dunedin Hospital and<br>35 from a collaboration with with German<br>collaborators<br>and so what we did was we used the the<br>gene expression information that Gene<br>information gene activity information to<br>build a predictor just like we've done<br>in the scope study and but instead of<br>using clinical information that we<br>collected from the woman now we're using<br>gene activity information that has been<br>assayed from these tumors and what we<br>did was we built a predictor in the New<br>Zealand data and then we predicted in<br>the German data based on that model<br>um what we thought would happen to those<br>patients all these patients had been<br>followed for five years and we did the<br>reverse thing we built a model in the<br>German data and we predicted into the<br>New Zealand data to see how they do and<br>what you can see here is what are called<br>survival curves<br>what we're looking at is time after<br>surgery here so you can see 16 months<br>five years out here and up here is our<br>group that we predicted to be good<br>prognosis so we predicted that the<br>cancer wouldn't come back and what you<br>can see is that over time they started<br>out all of them were disease free and<br>then over time someone would have a<br>relapse so this line would drop a little<br>bit and so by the end of the five years<br>and those that we predicted would have a<br>good prognosis roughly 70 or so of them<br>did whereas in the ones we predicted<br>would have a bad prognosis only about 40<br>of them were disease free so a lot more<br>of those that experience relapse so the<br>amazing thing there is that you can<br>remove a tumor<br>perform my career analysis look at the<br>gene activity and make a prediction<br>about what's going to happen to that<br>patient years in the future in terms of<br>their disease coming back which was the<br>first time I'd ever been involved in<br>something like this and was a real a<br>real eye-opener for me<br>and I'm going to jump forward very<br>quickly<br>um just to talk about that that Dunedin<br>colorectal cohort so that cohort still<br>exists today<br>um Roz is here<br>and Roz has been involved in a lot of<br>the a lot of Ross's research has<br>involved the um the colorectal cohort um<br>Ross and I have had a 35-year<br>collaboration probably some of you are<br>doing some math going that doesn't work<br>um Roz um went to school with my sister<br>so we all grew up in Nelson together and<br>it was really exciting when Roz came<br>back here to work at otago first in Tony<br>Reeves lab actually I'm in Biochemistry<br>and then very soon after that into a<br>lecturing position in microbiology and<br>Immunology so Rose has been a an amazing<br>adopter of new technology and I've been<br>lucky enough to be involved in some of<br>that but Ross has also been a real<br>Champion for that Dunedin colorectal<br>cohort and has helped establish a<br>governance group around that and so I've<br>got some of the individuals in that<br>governance group there because this is<br>an incredible incredible research<br>resources there's over a thousand<br>patients with many many years of<br>clinical follow-up available so um this<br>has been an absolute an absolute huge<br>asset and the research we've done<br>so around this time we've been thinking<br>about production and we started changing<br>our thinking a little bit I also changed<br>jobs uh so uh I've been working at the<br>University of Auckland but I've been<br>doing so much work with Tony and Perry<br>down here that<br>through mechanisms we won't even discuss<br>um Tony was somehow able to engineer a<br>shift to the Department of biochemistry<br>and at this point if Tony were here he's<br>traveling overseas so he's not here I<br>would thank Tony very much for all his<br>work there but also John catfield who<br>was headed apartment at the Time Warren<br>Tate who was a huge supporter of the<br>move and also Linda Holloway who was the<br>the pro Vice Chancellor and helped help<br>facilitate this so and Dunedin focusing<br>on this stuff<br>starting to look at and what's actually<br>going on in terms of biology so not just<br>can we use gene activity to predict<br>things but can we actually understand<br>the biology that's going on and we<br>started looking at proliferation so how<br>fast cells are growing within the tumors<br>immune response so and how well the<br>patient's immune system is actually<br>doing it attacking the tumor and also<br>chromosomal instability so how<br>um how disrupted the the chromosomes of<br>the tumors are in terms of<br>amplifications and deletions of their<br>DNA<br>the whole field was doing this right so<br>this was an international move and Iran<br>was starting to think more and more and<br>more about biology I've got a very quick<br>example here and of some genes that are<br>involved in immune response and what you<br>can see is I've put a blue mark up here<br>these are tumors in which these high<br>levels of immune activity which<br>indicates that the patient's immune<br>system is attacking the tumor and what<br>you can see is that in here that the<br>that group is doing a lot better than<br>this other group down here which has<br>lower levels of immune activity in the<br>tumor so just starting to show that<br>those biological mechanisms are actually<br>really important in terms of patient<br>prognosis<br>foreign<br>we really wanted to keep looking at this<br>in colorectal cancer but there wasn't<br>much data and there really wasn't a lot<br>of data available for us to do this and<br>so I started looking in a place where<br>there was a lot of data which was in<br>breast cancer so there's been a lot of<br>data generated in the breast cancer<br>field and all of it was public well a<br>lot of it was publicly available and<br>around that time Tony introduced me to<br>hear the kumliffe and so here that was<br>based at translational genomics in<br>Phoenix at the time and um we headed off<br>instantly and started so I started doing<br>more and more work with hither on breast<br>cancer and um we actually eventually<br>managed to arrange that I'd come into a<br>sabbatical with hither in Phoenix<br>at the time I was also working with with<br>Chris on genetic data analysis in in<br>breast cancer and also these things<br>coming together at once Tony also met<br>Lance Miller uh who was at the time<br>based in Singapore as a genomics<br>researcher who was also very very much<br>into uh into the analysis of breast<br>cancer data and Lance had some really<br>big plans in terms of putting data<br>together<br>um Heather and I also had really big<br>plans they involved Forks<br>do you remember Heather what the rest of<br>that environment<br>so let's ask on sabbatical in Phoenix<br>with forks<br>Lance however was not distracted by<br>forks and so what Lance wanted to do<br>Lance had actually been involved in a<br>lot of the really big breast cancer<br>studies that had been undertaken and so<br>what Lance wanted to do was assemble all<br>of that data into one big set and that<br>was no easy thing to do there was a lot<br>of standardization and normalization and<br>missing around to do that and that<br>became my job and so that's what I spent<br>an awful lot of time doing but once that<br>was done it enabled us to start asking<br>really complex questions about the<br>molecular biology of the tumors and how<br>they related to the characteristics of<br>those tumors and things like patient<br>prognosis and how the patients were<br>responding to treatment what you're<br>looking at here is a collection of genes<br>that are involved in proliferation so<br>determining how fast cells within the<br>tumor grow and and these ones here these<br>red ones are an indication of tumors in<br>which those genes are really active so<br>what that would suggest is that those<br>genes are probably highly proliferative<br>they're growing quite fast and along the<br>top I've got something called a metagine<br>which is really a summary of what's<br>going on on here and you see I've<br>ordered it from from low up to high and<br>this would indicate those low<br>proliferation tumors slow growing tumors<br>and fast growing tumors at this end when<br>you take that information turn it into<br>numbers and you can plot it against<br>tumor grade you can see that the<br>low-grade tumors tend to have low<br>proliferation scores the high grade<br>tumors seem to have high proliferation<br>scores this makes sense because tumor<br>grade encompasses proliferation as part<br>of the measure of determining grade it<br>also makes sense across the different<br>subtypes of breast cancer different<br>proliferation rates for the more and<br>less Progressive aggressive subtypes of<br>breast cancer so this was all very<br>promising we were able to ask lots of<br>questions about lots of different<br>biological processes using those samples<br>and we did and so there were lots of<br>papers um which used that large data set<br>as the basis of the work they were doing<br>one of them was a collaboration between<br>otago and Auckland so Anthony<br>Braithwaite and Chris print uh use this<br>uh this big cohort as a discovery cohort<br>to identify the gene yb1 as a key driver<br>of tumor cell growth and then there's<br>some really cool experiments in the lab<br>to better understand that and verify<br>what they'd found uh fantastic smiling<br>picture of Chris there a slightly less<br>well-known picture of Chris as he always<br>travels by limousine as a bioinformatics<br>rock star and if I have time later on<br>after this I'll tell you how we<br>accidentally got into a limousine<br>together in Phoenix<br>um no it's actually not as exciting that<br>sounds<br>um<br>Lance was also using this as well so um<br>Lance had a fantastic series of papers<br>that I was involved in uh where Lance<br>was looking at the interaction between<br>proliferation so the speed at which<br>tumors are growing uh and the patient's<br>immune response was Lance was able to<br>show<br>um he was able to split tumors into low<br>proliferation groups so genes down here<br>and we've got um we've got tumors across<br>across here<br>slow growing tumors medium growing<br>tumors and fast growing tumors and then<br>he was also stratifying by immune<br>response so low medium and high immune<br>response for each of these groups and<br>what Lance was able to show was that the<br>level of immune response actually didn't<br>make a difference for patient prognosis<br>except in the situation when you had<br>these very aggressive rapidly growing<br>tumors so you can see the survival<br>curves really starting to separate out<br>for the strong Indian response moderate<br>immune response and polar immune<br>response there and so that was a really<br>a really intriguing finding and that's<br>one of the Lancers continued to follow<br>um for a number of years after that so<br>those are sorts of things you can do<br>with those and I'm really glad Helen<br>mentioned uh nzgl um I needed a slide on<br>it so I could use this photo<br>um so so<br>um Helen's already covered this<br>um Tony LED this bid to create a<br>national genomics research<br>infrastructure and at some point someone<br>thought it was a fantastic idea to do a<br>Fleetwood Mac like photo shoot so<br>there's Tony Rachel Elliott I can see in<br>the audience laughing there myself and<br>Tony merryman unfortunately was shot in<br>November hence the the the facial here<br>and but this was a big deal this was a<br>lot of funding announced it was a major<br>multi-institutional initiative it was my<br>first foray into National infrastructure<br>of any kind and it really cemented otago<br>as a leader in the genomic space so this<br>was a it was a huge piece of work that<br>we did and it was really key for driving<br>some of the research that came after<br>that that utilized these Technologies we<br>were able to bring in there have been a<br>lot of other things that have come up<br>along the way and Lisa alluded to the<br>fact that I've worked on a lot of a lot<br>of different organisms and I have some<br>of you will perhaps recognize some of<br>your favorites out there I don't have<br>time to talk about all those exciting<br>things that that I've been involved in<br>with some wonderful researchers here but<br>I will dwell just briefly on this one<br>um which was an initiative that was led<br>by Phil Wilcox before he saw the light<br>and moved to Dunedin and I know he's up<br>there somewhere<br>um full led a fantastic program across<br>multiple institutions<br>um called the virtual Institute for<br>statistical genetics and at otago it was<br>myself and Tony Merriman that was<br>involved and this spawned some amazing<br>research by some great graduate students<br>so<br>um Huang James and Murray did some<br>incredible work and missence for looking<br>at Gene copy number changes in in DNA<br>James applied that methodology to both<br>gout and apples his master's thesis is<br>actually titled Gene copy number but in<br>gout and apples and so the Apple work<br>was done with in collaboration with<br>David chanye at plant food research and<br>then Murray did some fantastic work on<br>genetics selection in Pacific<br>populations and those guys have used<br>those Publications and really as a<br>springboard to go on and do some great<br>great stuff in their careers<br>right we're back to cancer<br>so 2009 we visited Singapore<br>met some wonderful people and there was<br>some misbehaving at dinner and what<br>you're looking at is one of the courses<br>and that course was chicken baked in<br>clay and what you did the instructions<br>were take the hammer gently tap the clay<br>and break apart and then the chicken<br>will be revealed whatever you do don't<br>smash the chicken for then the clay will<br>become embedded in the chicken and it<br>will become very hard to eat<br>Perry is illustrating that in his stance<br>luckily there were a number of other<br>courses available so we didn't go hungry<br>um I did have some of the clay and<br>bearded chicken it was not good<br>um the people we met were Nancy Jenkins<br>and Neil Copeland and the senior<br>postdocs Karen and Michael Mann all of<br>whom have become great friends and<br>collaborators over the years and what<br>they had done over many years is develop<br>a system an experimental system called<br>Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis<br>and mouse for studying cancer<br>I will not go through this<br>um but basically what Neil had Nancy had<br>done was they had taken those jumping<br>genes that I talked about earlier in the<br>work with Rob they'd taken those jumping<br>jeans and they'd engineered one of them<br>um to be very very specific in what it<br>did they created a system where they<br>could actually turn that jumping gene on<br>at a particular time in a particular<br>tissue in Mouse and what it would do<br>there were many many copies of this it<br>would start jumping around in the genome<br>and if it hit a gene that was involved<br>in preventing cancer and messed up the<br>the function of that Gene or if I had a<br>gene that might might promote cancer and<br>it started you know re increased the<br>activity of that Gene what would happen<br>would a tumor a tumor would would form<br>and if you took the tumors that form and<br>you figured out where those trans bosons<br>had inserted themselves and what genes<br>they had hit you could start to<br>understand what genes are involved in<br>the development and growth of cancers<br>these are the genes that are actually<br>causing cancer and and so they had<br>developed system everything was working<br>what they needed to do was figure out<br>how that related to human cancer and so<br>that was where they didn't have as much<br>expertise and so that was the challenge<br>for me was um I taking the work they'd<br>done and identifying the relevance and<br>and human cancer<br>and so it called for another sabbatical<br>not in Singapore because by that time<br>Neil and Nancy had gotten jobs in<br>Houston and so they were based at<br>Houston Methodist Research Institute and<br>and so off we went to Houston and we<br>went to NASA there's a picture of us at<br>Nasa and as I inserted this into my<br>slides the other day I noticed there was<br>this guy over here and it's actually<br>Chris print and man so Chris had come to<br>visit we went to NASA with Chris and<br>Chris was waiting very patiently for us<br>to have a family photo in front of the<br>rocket<br>um not knowing that he was of course in<br>the photo and that's me trying to send<br>one of my kids into space it didn't it<br>didn't work but it was great fun and<br>then for the new zealand-based<br>researchers this is lab lunch at Hugo's<br>Restaurant in Houston<br>um not remarkable is a remarkable<br>restaurant it's fantastic what is<br>remarkable that aside from myself Neil<br>and Nancy almost every person around<br>that table is a postdoctoral researcher<br>they had 15 postdocs in their research<br>group<br>when you do the math on that you can<br>tell that they were a very very<br>well-funded operation<br>so what that well-funded operation had<br>been doing was lots and lots of research<br>so over a number of years Chris and I<br>along with Michael and Neil and Nancy<br>and Karen had been working across a<br>number of tumors uh tumor types um this<br>one and in melanoma that Michael had led<br>um was um one where they managed to<br>identify a collection a core collection<br>of genes that were really driving the<br>development of melanoma and what we were<br>able to do was show that those so those<br>genes were definitely relevant in human<br>cancer and there was a whole lot of<br>other experimental work that was also<br>done to validate that these things were<br>really true melanoma drivers<br>um so that was a it was a a very very<br>long multi-year piece of work<br>um that was done and then that system<br>was extended so Karen had a fantastic<br>publication extending that extending<br>that system into a single cell analysis<br>so actually being able to do the<br>transpose on analysis and individual<br>cells which at the time was pretty<br>amazing and it also brought in some<br>familiar faces and it brought in layers<br>and Lux who did some uh had did some<br>generics work in the genomics facility<br>for this project so we're able to send<br>some samples back to New Zealand have<br>them do the work send the data back over<br>and then incorporate that into the<br>analysis that was a fantastic way to<br>connect both of our worlds together and<br>it wasn't the only time so um Anita and<br>I supervised Aziz and his PhD he<br>completed his PhD and he managed to<br>actually get a postdoctoral position<br>with Karen and Michael who at that point<br>had had set up new Labs in Tampa at<br>Moffat cancer center and so Aziz was<br>able to go over<br>um use some of the data they generated<br>from uh from that mutagenesis model this<br>time in squamous cell carcinoma I had a<br>fantastic publication of pulse genetics<br>and has recently taken a position in<br>Singapore now so great opportunity for<br>an otago graduate to go over to a really<br>big big lab in the US and do some do<br>some amazing research<br>and so that kind of takes me on to<br>capability building which<br>um for those of you who know me and this<br>has been a big part of what I've been<br>doing recently at otago and so in 2015<br>my PhD student asked for money to go and<br>camp at the University of Melbourne and<br>so that was Tom Kelly and what Tom Kelly<br>was talking about was something called<br>research Bazaar and research Bazaar was<br>something that was running at the<br>University of Melbourne and it was<br>designed to teach digital skills for<br>computer programming and Analysis and<br>computation and two early career<br>researchers and graduate students and it<br>was kind of backed or or built on<br>something called software carpentry<br>because Cabinetry training and so they<br>ran a program of what was called<br>instructor training where they would<br>teach people how to teach all these<br>Concepts and I went along to that I<br>didn't do the camping and we brought<br>that back and we brought that back to<br>New Zealand and have started growing<br>this community of people who can deliver<br>these these types of training around the<br>country and so it was kind of<br>underpinned by this thing called the<br>software carpentry Foundation this guy<br>here is sitting up there in the audience<br>somewhere he promised he'd be making<br>faces at me there he is Jonah duck was<br>like what we were doing so much he moved<br>his entire family to Dunedin to see what<br>we were up to he's been fantastic to<br>work with us work with on this<br>it's also been strongly supported by the<br>New Zealand e-science infrastructure and<br>Nick Jones there is the director has<br>really been a good supporter of us<br>running these training workshops which<br>many of you many of you will have been<br>to and many of your graduate students<br>will have been to to learn some of these<br>computational tools that have been so<br>valuable to my research and it was also<br>strongly supported by Tony's in my<br>research group so some pictures up there<br>a few extras on the end<br>um but Tony's group in particular really<br>took to this and really saw the value of<br>of these types of analytic abilities as<br>uh really part of modern genomics so<br>that data analysis that was such a key<br>part of the the work we're doing<br>um this has fed into the work we're<br>doing in genomics RTR so uh generosity<br>another<br>um major multi-institutional uh research<br>initiative and infrastructure uh lead by<br>Peter Deaton here at otago and my role<br>in that is to oversee the bioinformatics<br>component and a big part of that is<br>capability building uh so<br>um our training team so particularly in<br>ghoni who's just left us to pursue a<br>clinical genetics opportunity in in the<br>US and also Denny from from Nissi and<br>more recently now Tyler who we've just<br>hired as our training coordinator they<br>have been running these amazing<br>workshops so over a thousand attendees<br>over a three-year period 51 workshops<br>and all of these people coming to learn<br>all of these different computational and<br>bioinformatics techniques<br>and another key part of what genomics RT<br>Royal is doing at least the part that<br>I'm involved in and is building up a<br>genomic data repository uh for the data<br>that we generate from our indigenous<br>species so those Taiwan species that are<br>being studied in partnership with Maori<br>we need a place to put the data that's<br>generated in New Zealand so that we can<br>preserve the kaitiakitanga that's<br>associated with those with those data<br>and it also allows us to facilitate the<br>management and sharing of that data in a<br>way that upholds the principles of Maori<br>data sovereignty this has been a really<br>important initiative within GA and<br>although the team has been fantastic<br>it's done a wonderful job I'd really<br>like to single out being here bintiike<br>as having developed the the cultural<br>protocols that underpin all of the<br>access requests and the and the data<br>submission that goes on so that's been a<br>fantastic win there<br>I'm getting close to the end probably<br>everyone's getting tired and thirsty<br>um I'd really also like to highlight<br>some work I've been doing more recently<br>with um with the genomics team at ESR so<br>Donya and yupe and Miles who has just<br>left um to join another company<br>um have been great collaborators and<br>have given us the opportunity to have uh<br>co-supervised PhD students based at ESR<br>so working in a crown research and<br>Research Institute environment and Mars<br>is pictured there with some cool toys<br>those cool toys have certainly sort of<br>bled over into the work that we're doing<br>in the lab and we've got some pictures<br>of the cool toys there and we have a<br>picture of happy parry and sad Jordan<br>and so what have you said Jordan I'll do<br>here is on my desk in my office we've<br>got a mini DNA sequence here we've got a<br>touch screen and we've got a tiny<br>computer that runs the whole thing<br>um happy parry and said Jordan are<br>trying to look at the output from one of<br>those DNA sequences on their phone the<br>big screen TV in Perry's office is set<br>up it's receiving the signal Perry's<br>phone is receiving the signal from from<br>the sequencer unfortunately Jordan's was<br>not but we managed to fix it and I think<br>Sarah Jordan became happy Jordan<br>so that portable technique technology<br>has opened a lot of doors<br>um in terms of the ability to sequence<br>anything anytime anywhere<br>um these two guys have got some some<br>funding to investigate some very very<br>clever ways of doing that sequencing in<br>something called circulating tumor DNA<br>analysis so looking at clever ways of<br>doing that and this is this is really<br>looking at DNA<br>in the bloodstream that has come from<br>tumors and cancer patients and so this<br>can be used for early detection of<br>cancer and it can also be used for<br>monitoring cancer patients um while<br>they're undergoing treatment to see um<br>what's going on with the tumor whether<br>the tumors come back or whether the<br>tumor is still in remission<br>um we've got work going on in terms of<br>single cell sequencing so again being<br>able to look at what's going on at a<br>genomic level inside single cells and<br>again that portable genomics is a key<br>part of being able to get out into the<br>community and demonstrate these things<br>but also potentially do that genomic<br>work in different places and there's too<br>many photos here to put names on um but<br>this is all the game they're involved in<br>a lot of these projects which are being<br>led by by Perry Guilford in the lab<br>so<br>I have no idea how much time I took to<br>get here<br>um but it's time to say some thank yous<br>um I'd like to thank my family so here<br>are um Liam and Kieran a few years ago<br>now they're a bit bigger than this now<br>they can probably actually grow their<br>own mustaches now<br>um so I'd like to thank you guys<br>um my son's shaking his head at me at<br>the moment I'd like to thank you guys<br>for for being wonderful and for being so<br>much fun over the years and I'm sure<br>we're gonna have a lot of fun uh going<br>forward<br>um Mel I would like to

I've had really a great<br>experience my family we've had a really<br>supportive family and it's fantastic<br>they're able to be here to uh to share<br>this tonight<br>these guys don't need to think these<br>guys weren't able to be here tonight but<br>uh Tony in particular was instrumental<br>in getting me uh excited about cancer<br>genomics and in getting me um to otago<br>and Parry has been absolutely<br>inspirational and they've both been<br>wonderful friends and colleagues and<br>mentors over many years but as you saw<br>um there have been a huge number of<br>wonderful people that I've been lucky<br>enough to interact with and so that has<br>made this an incredibly enjoyable<br>journey to get to this point<br>um students there's lots of them sitting<br>over there and<br>students have made this job<br>um really what it is it's fantastic to<br>work with such bright and dedicated<br>young people who are so dedicated<br>um so intent on on what they're doing<br>and we've had an amazing crop over the<br>years<br>um I hope I haven't missed anyone out<br>there and<br>um in addition many of you have seen<br>those students my way most of my<br>students are co-supervised and doing<br>really interesting and amazing projects<br>um so thank you all for all of the um<br>all of the interactions we've had over<br>the years there are many many<br>collaborative projects I've been<br>involved in and I haven't been able to<br>talk about probably even half of them<br>um and the last thing I would say is<br>like to thank Department of biochemistry<br>Department of biochemistry even though I<br>made fun of them right at the start um<br>is really an amazing place to work it's<br>a fantastic team of people<br>um the cancer genetics lab is great to<br>work in the whole cancer genix lab is<br>just amazing but then the whole<br>biochemistry Department the admin staff<br>the IT team the teaching fellows have<br>really made an incredibly enjoyable<br>place to be so I'm really glad I made<br>the decision to uh to to leave Auckland<br>uh and come down here to Dunedin and and<br>become part of such a wonderful<br>department so thank you all for your<br>attention hopefully you have some idea<br>of how a statistician ended up in the<br>middle somewhere in there<br>um of a very well-masked uh biochemistry<br>Department<br>thank you all very much<br>so thank you all for coming along<br>tonight uh it's great that you come<br>along to celebrate mixed promotion<br>he's got quite the support crew here<br>with his family and friends and and<br>number of colleagues across the<br>University<br>uh what to say about make<br>there's lots to say there's lots to say<br>um thank you Mike for your awesome<br>lecture I think we just all enjoyed very<br>much hearing about your your career<br>all of your collaborative collaborations<br>all the people you've interacted with<br>the fun that you've had with your<br>colleagues is clear<br>and we really really enjoyed it so thank<br>you very much<br>um of course with Hussein Mac has the<br>unique skill of being able to work these<br>large data sets and making making sense<br>of them and this is a school skill that<br>is just so important across all facets<br>of science<br>and I think it's fair to say from day<br>one like you are in huge demand and even<br>more so now<br>um and and he's been in key demand as a<br>as a a key collaborator as a student<br>supervisor as an advisor and as a leader<br>in establishing a number of research<br>entities<br>and of course we've heard tonight the<br>fruits of your collaborations and all of<br>the wonderful work you've done working<br>up cancer genome data sets and coming up<br>with some really important information<br>about cancer biology diagnosis therapies<br>Etc and that that kind of stuff is so<br>important for for moving forward into<br>the future and personalized medicine<br>really important<br>Mecca's also been in huge demand as a<br>teacher<br>um I think at last count you you teach<br>in 10 papers and right across the board<br>um he has had absolutely outstanding<br>evaluations and the things that come<br>through always and his evaluations are<br>his passion his enthusiasm and his<br>ability to explain very complex Concepts<br>uh<br>his passion for teaching obviously<br>extends Way Beyond otago we've seen you<br>know the data that the carpentry<br>workshops that Mick has been integral in<br>establishing right up and down the<br>country and it's actually very<br>comforting to know that there's a whole<br>generation of students that now are<br>going to be able to perform statistics<br>and bioinformatics and you've<br>transferred some of your skills to a<br>whole new generation of students<br>uh what to say about Mike I mean there's<br>just too many qualities I I can't list<br>them all but I'll just pull out a few<br>you're very calm you're very logical<br>uh you're inclusive you're professional<br>and you're very very collegial and I<br>think those qualities have seen you<br>sharing a number of committees uh right<br>across the university and nationally<br>um<br>but I thought I would just leave the<br>last word with your supervisor from<br>Purdue<br>so she said Mick is an extremely nice<br>well-grand grounded young man mature<br>Beyond his years<br>every professor in their career should<br>have the Good Fortune of having worked<br>with such a gifted student<br>make you are now the professor<br>and I'm pretty sure uh having seen all<br>the talented students that you have um<br>attracted into your lab over the years<br>that you will indeed have the Good<br>Fortune of having many gifted students<br>working with you<br>congratulations on making professor the<br>Department's very very proud of you and<br>we are absolutely extremely lucky to<br>have you<br>um in our department so well done<br>and I think there's a gift a little gift<br>that I need to present with you that I<br>now I think it's over to you Neil<br>foreign<br>Deputy Pro Vice Chancellor Health<br>Sciences and I have the easiest job of<br>the evening which is actually just to<br>thank Mick again for a wonderful lecture<br>and actually invite you to participate<br>in some like beverages to celebrate with<br>Mick his significant achievement I just<br>want to add because I have collaborated<br>with Mick what a wonderful privilege it<br>has been to work with you over the years<br>you're a wonderful colleague and one of<br>the things that I think people don't<br>recognize uh and it is that you're such<br>an amazing instigator of new initiatives<br>and and I've really admired that about<br>you over the years and I thank you for<br>that so please uh just join with me in<br>thanking again<br>otago Mech for his wonderful oration uh<br>for his IPL thank you very much Mick<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
