great<br>pleasure to<br>welcome you here today to this important<br>event the celebration of Maryland<br>hibma's promotion to professor and I<br>must say that this is one of the the<br>great pleasures of my role is to be part<br>of these wonderful events and get to see<br>presentations from all over the<br>university and as many of you know we've<br>had a few delays recently with covid and<br>we're back in the swing of things<br>and in fact this week we have four alone<br>so it's wonderful to be here and and uh<br>and to be back in the swing as I say my<br>main role is to welcome you all and<br>um we've welcomed all those who are here<br>uh live welcome those online and I know<br>that many people are watching online<br>from all around the world both live and<br>delayed at some stage so welcome<br>everybody welcome everyone from from The<br>Wider university community uh the one at<br>Dunedin community and Beyond but I do<br>want to especially welcome<br>um Maryland's whanau and friends and I<br>have on good account that there are<br>quite a few a few here and I would<br>particularly want to mention Marilyn's<br>mother Helen<br>uh welcome nice to see you here<br>um brother Michael<br>sister-in-law Dell<br>and also Merlin's partner Lindsay I've<br>made a good guess in the front row here<br>so welcome everybody yeah I got it right<br>I also know there'll be other family<br>members joining from a lot of other<br>places including possibly from overseas<br>and also a lot of other people who have<br>really been a support to Maryland over a<br>long period of time former students<br>former staff current and former staff<br>and friends and I gather from all around<br>the world Maryland was just<br>mentioned in some of the country so<br>welcome to everybody<br>um before I hand over to Joe Baxter to<br>give a bit more of a detailed<br>introduction to Merlin I just want to<br>mention that Marilyn and I have actually<br>worked together for quite a number of<br>years and strangely even though we both<br>have research interests in microbes<br>it's actually that's not the reason<br>we've intersected mostly it's about<br>buildings<br>and for those who don't know Merlin's<br>had a critical role in Health Sciences<br>managing a portfolio as associate dean<br>of the space of their space issues and<br>Health Sciences and so I can attest that<br>as a scientist Marilyn has really<br>developed quite an expertise in<br>understanding construction and project<br>management has now quite an expert of<br>that area but for me this is a real real<br>treat to be able to<br>listen to Merlin today talk about her<br>passion for viruses and viral Immunology<br>for a change as opposed to buildings so<br>big congratulations Marilyn really well<br>deserved promotion and I'll pass over to<br>Joe Baxter<br>glasses on<br>um<br>well Kilda everyone and it is a huge<br>honor and privilege for me to be able to<br>stand up here and to introduce Marilyn<br>so for those of you who don't know me<br>I'm Joe Baxter I am the very new Dean of<br>the Dunedin school of medicine and I was<br>absolutely delighted to be offered the<br>opportunity to introduce Maryland today<br>I have known Marilyn for a number of<br>years and I think there are a few people<br>that have really inspired me as is a<br>woman who's taking on leadership roles<br>within the university and Maryland is<br>one of those and so I want to<br>acknowledge you Marilyn personally for<br>that<br>so I also want to acknowledge Maryland<br>svano and friends who are here in person<br>and on zoom and also to colleagues<br>students and many others who are here<br>today<br>so Marilyn is has many strengths to her<br>bow<br>and I want to start with her as a as a<br>staff member who is the Deputy hod in<br>the department of pathology<br>she's a viral immunologist whose<br>research interest is human<br>papillomavirus and cancer<br>she completed her PhD studies in the<br>department of microbiology and<br>Immunology at otago and her postdoctoral<br>work was carried out at the Imperial<br>cancer research fund Laboratories at the<br>University of Cambridge in the UK<br>much of Maryland's research has explored<br>immune regulation by human<br>papillomavirus with a particular focus<br>on viral regulation of antigen<br>presenting cells in the skin<br>she has led the development of a<br>collaboration to support implementation<br>research for HPV screening in the<br>Pacific and and as part of a team that<br>applies cope up a Maori methodology to<br>explore the use of HPV DNA testing to<br>maximize uptake in underscreened Maori<br>her research continues to contribute to<br>advances in basic biology of HPV and its<br>clinical application to reduce the<br>incidence of cervical cancer<br>alongside David I would also like to<br>acknowledge Maryland's other significant<br>contribution that I have been involved<br>with and that is as the associate dean<br>of the space portfolio in the division<br>of Health Sciences and in that role I<br>have been I was really impressed with<br>Maryland's capacity to<br>um is anyone here I'll just check who's<br>in the orders to herd cats to be able to<br>deal with something that is incredibly<br>complex both at a big systems issue but<br>also right down to detail and as I was<br>thinking about<br>how we have someone who's got such an<br>amazing research background and who has<br>taken her research From the Bench<br>through pastor the bedside and into a<br>big picture capacity to make a<br>difference at a public health issue I<br>see that she has it I think rare<br>capacity to be able to work at the level<br>of extreme detail but at the same time<br>hold the wider context and I think<br>that's a really unusual and rare rare<br>capacity so I want to acknowledge you<br>so without further Ado Maryland's<br>presentation this evening spans the<br>translational research Continuum from<br>that basic biomedical research exploring<br>the interface between HPV and the immune<br>system and immune micro environment an<br>HPV pre-cancer through to the<br>implementation of a point of care HPV<br>testing so I wish to invite Professor<br>foreign<br>wa<br>foreign<br>Vice Chancellor and esteemed colleagues<br>welcome guests and friends and family<br>it's so lovely to see you all here<br>today it is my opportunity to promote to<br>you my research and tell you about what<br>I've been doing for the last however<br>many years in fact since probably the<br>1990s<br>I want to put my research on the context<br>of a translational research success<br>story and that is the success story for<br>human papilloma virus and cervical<br>cancer we have gone from the stage of<br>not actually understanding what the<br>causality of this virus of this cancer<br>is right through to now being able to<br>vaccinate and to protect people against<br>a particular cancer<br>that is underpinned by basic biomedical<br>research<br>so I'll introduce to you this concept of<br>translational research translational<br>research is the idea that we do we carry<br>out basic research and clinical research<br>and a Continuum that leads to health<br>improved Health outcomes<br>so we have translation from basic<br>science to human studies and translation<br>of clinical knowledge into improved<br>Health outcomes<br>this is the general concept of bench to<br>bedside<br>this is really critical and has been<br>Illustrated very well in the context of<br>human papillomavirus<br>I had to reflect on my research career<br>and wonder about how I could possibly<br>put this in a context and prioritize<br>what I should talk about and what I<br>should perhaps edit out so what I did<br>was made a word cloud of all the people<br>that I have co-authored Publications<br>with and that's what you can see here<br>this wonderful range of people and these<br>people have been important collaborators<br>or students or staff throughout my<br>research career<br>and I'll start by picking out just a few<br>names as I go through this talk so we<br>have this broader concept of this<br>translational research and we have some<br>specific people along the way that are<br>also part of the contact context of my<br>research and the first of those people<br>is Emeritus Professor Frank Griffin<br>and he is named because he was my PhD<br>supervisor<br>so I first came over here into Dunedin<br>in 1980<br>uh to do medical intermediate<br>I not long after I arrived got glandular<br>fever which is of course a disease<br>caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and<br>that really knocked me around and it<br>gave did a few things that gave me an<br>interest in viruses and the immune<br>system<br>and it also redirected my career from<br>the idea of doing medicine to the idea<br>I got involved in the department of<br>microbiology and Immunology and uh with<br>Frank Griffin Frank Griffin as shown<br>here<br>and this animal here was a big part of<br>what Frank Griffin did when I went into<br>the lab Frank spent a lot of time<br>talking to Farmers and I thought why is<br>he talking to Farmers and not paying<br>attention to me because I'm one of his<br>students come on but actually what he<br>was doing is what I Now understand as<br>stakeholder engagement he was really<br>working on what is important to the<br>the other person on the slide is James<br>Innis and I would also like to<br>acknowledge Mingo Ennis who is streaming<br>and today who is James's son<br>James was pivotal because he was part of<br>Holden station and Holden station was a<br>big deer farm near Fairley<br>James and Holden station funded my PhD<br>research and also some of the<br>experimentation that was carried out was<br>actually done with deer on that farm<br>we were privileged to be able to fly out<br>there one day and see what an amazing<br>operation this Farm was so full credit<br>James is no longer with us sadly but he<br>was truly inspiring and committed to<br>so during this time we did a few things<br>we characterized dear immunoglobulin<br>this was actually the first<br>characterization of der immunoglobulin<br>and it was the<br>mid to late 80s monoclonal antibody<br>technology was relatively recently<br>discovered and we made the first<br>monoclonal antibodies to Deer<br>immunoglobulin<br>we established adjuvant so adjuvants are<br>things that we add to protein when we<br>make a vaccine we established adjuvants<br>that worked really well and deer this<br>was important if we were to vaccinate<br>deer and we determined the antibody<br>responses actually were enhanced after<br>deer were separated so this was a bit of<br>a surprise we expected the immune system<br>to be suppressed what we saw was<br>actually enhancement of the immune<br>response<br>following a separation stress where we<br>took the we weaned the animals and we<br>looked at the the antibodies of the<br>mother so a few surprises and a few<br>discoveries and a few tools that were<br>made<br>at the end of that PhD the the next<br>thing that people tend to do is look at<br>where they might do a postdoc and what<br>might interest them<br>I was particularly interested in going<br>to Britain I didn't really want to go to<br>the US but I really like the idea of<br>going to Britain I'd never been to<br>Cambridge but of course it's steeped in<br>history and it is an amazing place with<br>regard to science<br>we were actually I got a postdoc in the<br>Imperial cancer research fund which was<br>in a prefab on the top of this building<br>there I worked in a lab with some<br>amazing people<br>here we see Toshi toshiyuki sasagawa who<br>I still in contact with Massimo<br>thomasino<br>Ken Raj was someone I had amazing<br>conversations with during lunch times<br>every day while I was there<br>and John dorba was one of those names<br>you will have seen in that word cloud<br>Jan zoo was pivotal in the virus-like<br>particle that was used as the vaccine<br>but the key person during my time there<br>was this person named Lionel Crawford<br>and Lionel Crawford had spent a lot of<br>time at Cold Spring Harbor he was right<br>on the thick of this area of DNA tumor<br>viruses<br>he was particularly interested in human<br>papillomavirus but his background was in<br>fact<br>outstanding because he was one of the<br>co-authors on the paper where they<br>published about the molecule p53<br>and p53 is one of the most important<br>cancer proteins that we know about<br>he was an inspiration<br>and when I first arrived there I was<br>fairly impoverished as students are<br>after they finished their phds<br>he and Elizabeth his wife very kindly<br>took me in and I stayed with them for<br>probably about four weeks while I got<br>established and found a flat<br>so they were really really supportive<br>and I have fond memories of Lionel<br>basically downloading all of his<br>information that he knew about human<br>papillomavirus this curious DNA tumor<br>virus in the backyard during lunch times<br>while we would eat our lunch and cycling<br>until work after Lionel on the way to<br>the Pathology Department so really quite<br>exciting times<br>but what about the research in the<br>context of what we were doing if you<br>look at that time frame it was 1990 I<br>went from<br>otago across to Cambridge<br>now when we think of the<br>cervical cancer and the timeline often<br>we start with the 1800s where there was<br>a paper published that made the<br>observation that nuns and unmarried<br>woman didn't get cervical cancer<br>that was curious<br>so that was a suggestion that there<br>might have been an infectious etiology<br>relating to a sexually transmitted<br>infection<br>in relation to the causality of cervical<br>cancer<br>and then if we fast forward to 1933 the<br>next pivotal moment was George pepper<br>nicolau and he developed the pap smear<br>which is basically a smear of cells<br>taken from the cervix where you can<br>identify changes in those cells and use<br>that diagnostically to establish<br>pre-cancer<br>uh that way you can treat Woman by<br>ablative therapy and prevent the<br>cervical cancer and that is still the<br>Harold sirhausen in 1983<br>was really big on the idea<br>that there was a viral etiology to this<br>cancer<br>and what he did was able to was able to<br>find HPV DNA in cervical biopsies<br>so thus established the link between the<br>he was also able to clone specific genes<br>so take bits of those virus and put them<br>into bacteria and make more of them make<br>the proteins and that was also important<br>because that enabled people to study<br>this virus and actually work on it it's<br>not a virus that you can easily culture<br>you can't just take this virus and put<br>it with some cells and grow it so this<br>cloning of DNA was really significant<br>in a 1990 we started our national<br>cervical screening program in New<br>Zealand of course this was after much<br>controversy with the Cartwright inquiry<br>and indeed<br>so what was this all about this was<br>about this virus that you can see here<br>this is a cryo-electron microscopy image<br>of the virus and what you're seeing is<br>the proteins on the outside of the virus<br>so this is the L1 and L2 proteins that<br>make up the coat of the virus so we've<br>got a couple of proteins and inside that<br>is some DNA and that DNA encodes eight<br>different genes and those genes are<br>really quite interesting in themselves<br>you'll all be familiar with this virus<br>who here hasn't had a wart on their feet<br>or a wart such as this that proliferates<br>out perhaps on their hands warts are<br>very common<br>there are over 200 types of human<br>papillomavirus and fortunately only 12<br>of them cause cancer<br>so there are many other types that don't<br>cause cancer and you can see some of<br>those types disease caused by some of<br>those types demonstrated here<br>but this is what we're particularly<br>interested in because of the global<br>burden of cancer of cervical cancer<br>here you can see the paper Nicolaus<br>smear that shows normal cells but also<br>shows cells with changes that indicate<br>that there is a virus infection there so<br>that can be used diagnostically and here<br>we see a cervix and we see the region<br>that is affected with effectively what's<br>a viral infection in the cervix<br>if this infection persists this can<br>become cancer over time<br>and how does that happen<br>well you're looking at a virus that<br>infects our cutaneous surfaces and our<br>mucosal surfaces<br>it infects the epithelium<br>so this is the outside of our skin and<br>these are the dividing cells in the<br>bottom of our skin the basal layer<br>here's the normal epidermis here's the<br>virus particles getting in they're<br>getting in through a micro abrasion or<br>tissue damage<br>they get into these bottom cells and<br>start that are dividing and they start<br>to replicate then an advice in a<br>life cycle that's associated with the<br>differentiation of the skin cells we<br>start to get virus particles produced<br>if that infection is persistent we can<br>get changes the virus can incorporate<br>its genome into our cells and we can<br>start to get pre-malignant lesions that<br>here we were at a situation where we<br>knew that there we could we had cloned<br>viral genes<br>we knew HPV caused cancer here was an<br>opportunity to develop a prophylactic<br>vaccine<br>and that was really what Lionel got me<br>in to do<br>so there's a whole variety of proteins<br>that we can actually look at if we want<br>to make a vaccine any of the viral<br>proteins could potentially be targets I<br>spent a bit of time thinking about this<br>and thought what about one of these<br>early proteins because they're really<br>important in keeping the virus infection<br>going<br>others pursued the late proteins and we<br>know the end of the story because in<br>fact it was the late proteins that<br>became part of the vaccine that's used<br>today<br>so with a focus on this E2 protein we<br>had to do some particular things along<br>the path to make a vaccine and one of<br>those was to purify the protein<br>one of them was to make these monoclonal<br>antibodies against the E2 protein and<br>those antibodies that we made are still<br>being marketed and sold today globally<br>we also looked at this E2 protein and<br>what it did<br>how it interacted with one of the other<br>at the end of that postdoc it was time<br>to return to New Zealand we've made that<br>decision and<br>so I contacted Frank Griffin and thought<br>well perhaps There's an opportunity here<br>to come back to university university of<br>otago Frank spoke to this person here<br>Andrew Mercer Andrew Mercer was the head<br>of the director of the virus Research<br>Unit in the microbiology and Immunology<br>Department<br>and as you can see by his size of his<br>name we published many papers together<br>and<br>Andrew is actually traveling in the<br>North Island today so it's not able to<br>be here but what we had was a wonderful<br>team of people who were working on all<br>virus<br>and we also worked on human<br>papillomavirus and you can see that team<br>of people here and I particularly want<br>to acknowledge Kathy mccorn and Eleanor<br>Whelan who are sitting in the audience<br>so<br>what about the immune system I'm afraid<br>it's time to educate you a little bit<br>about it<br>the immune system is made up of the<br>white cells in our body a whole range of<br>different cells that are they<br>differentiate into different cell types<br>that do different things people<br>sometimes think of these as a soul<br>soldiers in an army as specialists in<br>some way and they absolutely are<br>I'm going to introduce you to just a few<br>different cell types<br>of particular interest are the antigen<br>presenting cells there are two different<br>flavors of these cells the dendritic<br>cells and the langerhan cells<br>the langerhan cells are the ones that<br>are in the skin that's why I have an<br>interest in those<br>dendritic cells and langerhan cells the<br>antigen presenting cells take up the<br>little bits of virus<br>and they present it but they have to<br>present it nicely it's got to be<br>packaged well in the right way<br>if it's not the lymphocytes don't always<br>respond in the right way and the<br>lymphocytes are our defending Army<br>they're the ones that can do things like<br>kill virus infected cells<br>they can also kill cancer cells they can<br>we have helper T cells that produce<br>chemicals that can have antiviral<br>effects<br>and we have B cells and these B cells<br>produce antibodies if you think of our<br>recent covert situation those B cells<br>were really critical in neutralizing<br>virus particles to<br>so if we were interested in developing a<br>vaccine first we want to know is there<br>actually any natural immunity to this<br>virus<br>because wouldn't we think that we would<br>want to look for the natural immunity<br>and try and enhance it or mimic it<br>we looked at immunity to HPV infection<br>in humans and what we saw was that the<br>E2 protein that we'd selected as our<br>favorite protein as our immunogen for<br>this vaccine contained the right bits<br>that contain bits that were really<br>attractive for the helper cells and for<br>the cytotoxic T cells<br>so tick that sounded great<br>the helper T cell responses could be<br>detected<br>in woman<br>who had cervical dysplasia so this is<br>the early stage HPV infection<br>great tick not only that but it was<br>associated with resolution of that<br>cervical dysplasia<br>that's even better<br>and you look at antibodies to L1 and<br>what did we see actually they were not<br>associated with resolution<br>what a surprise really surprising<br>considering that this is the basis of<br>our vaccine and it goes to show that<br>nature doesn't always tell us the best<br>way to make a vaccine<br>sometimes we can introduce a take a<br>strategy that actually works better than<br>what works in response to a virus in<br>nature<br>so in terms of E2 it all looked Rosy we<br>did some things in terms of developing a<br>vaccine we were able to show that if we<br>took the E2 protein and transduced it<br>into these antigen presenting cells<br>we could make a really nice package that<br>was attractive for the uh to to control<br>the E2 response and vaccinia virus<br>so basically that meant that these<br>killer cells were there and that these<br>helper cells were being activated<br>so it was all Rosy<br>we could immunize mice with the E2<br>protein and this adjuvant called mf59<br>mf59 is an edge event that's already<br>used in humans so we thought all this is<br>great<br>something's already been tested it's<br>been FDA approved we're on good track<br>here not only that but we can make our<br>helper T cell responses and we can make<br>our cytotoxic T-cell responses so we've<br>got the killer we've got the killers and<br>we've got the help<br>it's all going swimmingly<br>in the meantime<br>while we were doing all this Jan Zoo who<br>I showed you that photo of who was in<br>the lab in Cambridge<br>assembled a virus like particle made up<br>of the L1 protein the coke protein<br>by 2001 10 years later there was an FDA<br>approval granted for HPV testing<br>but more importantly<br>2016 2006 there was FDA approval<br>granted for an HPV vaccine<br>and only two years later we were<br>vaccinating our children our young girls<br>in New Zealand<br>we now vaccinate our boys as well and<br>that's because HPV is also important in<br>the causality of head and neck cancer so<br>it's really important that we also<br>well<br>time to stop thinking about that<br>prophylactic vaccine and move on to<br>something therapeutic because what about<br>all those people who couldn't get the<br>prophylactic vaccine couldn't be<br>protected against this virus already had<br>been exposed and were getting disease<br>at the moment the disease is ablate if<br>you're basically cutting it something<br>out or you're burning something off and<br>that's quite destructive so what about<br>if you could just vaccinate<br>and<br>the condition would disappear the cells<br>would just go because those killer cells<br>will come in the helper cells would come<br>in and the cells would go<br>cured sounds great<br>well in context The Herald and 16th of<br>October 2005 we had Hazel Lewis who was<br>the head of the national screening<br>program in New Zealand saying what's now<br>needed as a treatment for woman already<br>infected with HPV so she agreed this was<br>a great idea<br>but what Hitler said was actually the<br>virus is very good at hiding itself from<br>the body says so the immune system<br>doesn't realize it should be mounting an<br>attack until it's too late<br>hipmer is currently looking at ways to<br>expose the cynical Sinister cloaking<br>mechanism<br>success is a way off says hubma but<br>phrases success that's Ian Fraser who<br>with Gen Zu developed the L1 vaccine the<br>prophylactic vaccine has given all<br>researchers a boost and served as a<br>reminder that funding for health and<br>science research does pay off<br>it's certainly paid off with a<br>that all sounds great but in fact<br>therapeutic vaccine is vaccination is<br>way way harder than prophylactic<br>vaccines<br>and there's a whole lot of reasons for<br>that and they're mostly surrounding the<br>fact that pathogens can avoid the immune<br>system<br>as can cancer cells<br>so if we think of an HPV infection we<br>have two scenarios here on the one side<br>for a lot of women they actually do<br>develop an immune response they do clear<br>the viral infection they resolve it and<br>they don't need follow-up treatment they<br>don't progress and get cancer<br>it's only about one percent who progress<br>and part of that is contributed to by<br>immune evasion<br>we have this immune system these T cells<br>and these B cells and these antigen<br>presenting cells<br>they're there to help us but what about<br>the virus they're trying the virus is<br>trying to avoid being detected<br>because it just wants to keep<br>replicating and making more of itself<br>wants to spread it wants to infect other<br>people<br>so we knew therapeutic vaccination was<br>going to be harder<br>but the one benefit was that the<br>proteins that we were going to Target<br>became way easier<br>this is because when HPV progresses<br>towards causing its cancer causality it<br>is a consequence of the viral DNA<br>getting incorporated into the<br>chromosomes<br>so the virus normally exists as an<br>epizome this viral episome what it does<br>it gets linearized and Incorporated and<br>integrated into our DNA<br>when this happens invariably there are<br>two proteins that are retained the E6<br>and the E7 protein<br>those two proteins are cancer-causing<br>proteins<br>E6 binds to that protein that Lionel<br>discovered co-discovered the protein<br>called p53 that guardian of the genome<br>protects our DNA from other changes in<br>it in in the sequences and keeps keeps<br>everything ticking along when it's lost<br>there's the potential for mutations<br>and the other protein E7 binds and<br>degrades this other protein in our cells<br>called retinoblastoma RB and RB is<br>important in this controlling the cell<br>cycle when it's lost we get<br>dysregulation of the cell cycle<br>so after those two events occur we get<br>up regulation of these and we get<br>integration we get increased expression<br>of these proteins<br>we subsequently get additional mutations<br>and those are the events that eventually<br>foreign<br>obvious targets because they're always<br>retained in the cancer cells so great<br>proteins to use for a therapeutic<br>vaccine<br>that's exactly what we did<br>We Knew by then that virus-like<br>particles were great as immunogens they<br>generated a really good response here<br>you can see a virus like particle made<br>out of rabbit hemorrhagic disease<br>it contains bits of protein that are<br>particularly attractive for helper T<br>cells<br>that's these little Padre sequences<br>and couple to that we put an E6 epitope<br>so a little piece of this E2 protein E6<br>protein<br>that is uh basically attractive for the<br>killer cells<br>so we have the helper<br>component we have the cytotoxic<br>component<br>we can immunize mice with these<br>components and then look at the survival<br>following uh<br>a Cancer and a cancer model so basically<br>first we take some cancer cells we<br>inject them subcutaneously in the mouse<br>we then look at the immunizations the<br>therapeutic vaccines and we look at how<br>long the mouse is able to survive but<br>this is to a Humane end point so we<br>euthanize the mice way before they<br>actually get sick but once the tumors<br>reach a certain size<br>so here you can see without the<br>vaccination it's about 40 days that we<br>have to do that and with vaccination we<br>can extend that to about 60 days so we<br>can extend the life of a mouse that has<br>cancer<br>but if we add this ctla-4 antibody<br>this is known as a checkpoint inhibitor<br>these checkpoint Inhibitors are now<br>being used in the clinic for the control<br>of cancer<br>if we add that checkpoint inhibitor you<br>can see we can further extend the<br>survival on these mice<br>what that tells us is that what we were<br>presenting was something that kind of<br>looked like this<br>and if we add a checkpoint inhibitor it<br>can look more like this more attractive<br>that suggests that there were<br>immunization mechanisms or regulation of<br>these antigen presenting cells that was<br>inhibiting their ability to present<br>we then launched into quite a lot of<br>study of immune suppression mechanisms<br>mediated by these E6 and E7 proteins<br>we found a whole lot of different things<br>large extracellular vesicles are little<br>bits of cell that are Shed from all of<br>our cells<br>we found that if we put this E6 and E7<br>protein into cells<br>those little bits that are Shed off are<br>actually really quite suppressive for<br>the immune system<br>so these things can signal in our body<br>they can inhibit the antigen presenting<br>cells<br>and subsequently inhibit the cytotoxic T<br>this is a piece of skin human skin cut<br>in a section cut downwards if you were<br>to cut down into your skin this way this<br>is the top of the skin and this is the<br>bottom of what we know is the epidermis<br>here we can see these green stained<br>cells these are bound by an antibody<br>that fluoresces green that helps<br>identify them<br>you can see these beautiful cells here<br>are the langerhan cells those antigen<br>presenting cells in our skin that help<br>defend us and present antigen to the T<br>cells<br>we found that the viral protein E7 if<br>you express that in the skin it actually<br>suppresses the cytotoxic T Cell response<br>so that provides direct evidence that<br>the T Cell the E7 protein is inhibiting<br>the immune response and the ability of<br>cells to come in and kill those cells<br>expressing the E7 protein<br>we also showed that this protein called<br>EK adherion this adhesion molecule is<br>suppressed by the HPV virus and that's<br>important because that that molecule<br>helps the langerhan cells stick and stay<br>in the site<br>by losing that E6 protein these<br>langerhan cells are by losing their<br>ecoherent protein these langerhan cells<br>are able to migrate and are unimpeded<br>we also curiously showed that these<br>langerhan cells which are antigen<br>presenting cells and you think would be<br>really important actually if you've got<br>rid of them all together it didn't make<br>any difference to the T Cell response so<br>again sometimes what you think is going<br>to be the right thing actually turns out<br>so that was it we learned a whole lot of<br>things about<br>how HPV is avoiding detection and why it<br>is so hard to make this therapeutic<br>vaccine<br>my next move was after being in<br>microbiology initially then to pathology<br>and then in microbiology was back to<br>pathology to the hercus building you can<br>see that lovely building here<br>in 2014 I took up a position in the<br>by then<br>you can see there's still not been any<br>significant advances in terms of<br>therapeutic vaccination we still don't<br>really have an effective therapeutic<br>vaccine in the clinic but what we do<br>have following on from this HPV testing<br>is some advances in testing for the<br>virus that helps us diagnostically for<br>detecting pre-cancer stages<br>there are two things here that I want to<br>highlight and one is to feed Gene expert<br>which is a point of care test which lets<br>you test<br>people in the clinic and give give them<br>results within an hour making that very<br>accessible for women<br>we have a big advance in New Zealand and<br>that HPV testing will become the primary<br>screen<br>so no longer will we be looking for<br>those changes in the cells we will now<br>this is the current screening with the<br>cytobrush and for the woman and the<br>audience who have experienced this this<br>involves the speculum the treated<br>speculum it's not particularly<br>comfortable or Pleasant and the<br>clinician takes a brush off the cervix<br>take to get the cells and those are<br>locked at after they've been stained<br>this has a degree of sensitivity and<br>specificity on the right hand side here<br>we have the DNA test which is much more<br>sensitive and some Lee specific<br>so we get increased sensitivity but a<br>major Advance with this is that it's<br>very enabling<br>you don't need that speculum anymore<br>a woman can do this herself with a swab<br>it can just be a vaginal swab and it's<br>good enough so wow what in advance not<br>only that a result that's negative is<br>good for five years so you don't need to<br>we were very interested in this concept<br>of point of care for HPV and the<br>combination with the DNA test the swab<br>in terms of accessibility and<br>particularly in countries that maybe<br>don't have screening programs currently<br>so I then want to acknowledge Beverly<br>Lawton who was at University of otago<br>Wellington and is now at Victoria<br>University<br>and I've worked with her for a number of<br>years looking at a whole range of<br>aspects of HPV vaccination and<br>particularly iniquity in Maori<br>I'd also like to specifically<br>acknowledge at this point komatoa<br>Matthew Bennett who's been involved in<br>this research and it's really helped to<br>just highlight a few papers in relation<br>to this work and the first is around<br>acceptability of a self-taken swab<br>there are a lot of questions about this<br>idea of a swab<br>and whether it would be acceptable<br>whether it would be trusted<br>can can we do this ourselves when a<br>clinician probably does it better was a<br>question<br>I think our attitudes have changed quite<br>a lot with covert now that we're all<br>busy testing ourselves for the virus<br>without hesitation we've demystified a<br>lot of that<br>but this article was published in 2019<br>and the question really was if you have<br>women who are under screened who have<br>real issues with getting Access to<br>Health Care provision<br>Willis self-collected swab help with<br>that because we know some of the<br>barriers are actually around the<br>physical process of getting the swab<br>some of the barriers are actually around<br>getting to where you need to get the<br>swab taken<br>and the study this qualitative research<br>indicated that this was really going to<br>we also did research looking at<br>really the introduction of HPV testing<br>in woman<br>and the impact at the community level<br>and that was the uh this was the outcome<br>of that research<br>there's another study underway currently<br>that is looking at point of care and<br>using that particular device that I<br>showed before that Gene expert and<br>whether having that in the clinic is<br>going to shorten the pathway to<br>colposcopy to treatment for woman<br>Samoa was a point of focus we carried<br>out stakeholder engagement in Samoa<br>particularly because Samoa doesn't<br>currently have a screening program<br>there's no organized HPV screening<br>we developed the cervical cancer<br>prevention in the Pacific collaboration<br>and you can see there are a number of<br>meetings held in some more<br>and the outcomes of that included<br>Professor alaki coroma who's now the uh<br>Vice Chancellor of the National<br>University of Samoa setting up a private<br>Clinic with this point of care device in<br>apia<br>the other outputs or stilter some still<br>to be realized<br>our<br>building capability<br>amongst Samoan clinicians particularly<br>so on the left hand side we have Dr<br>malama tufanati Who did a study in Samoa<br>looking at the acceptability of HPV<br>self-testing<br>and that study again qualitative studies<br>supported the introduction of this as an<br>accessible test<br>and at the back of the room we're very<br>honored to have Dr Filipina and mosa<br>Lisa lisam who's looking at changes in<br>the tumor micro environment or in the<br>tissue microenvironment and cervical<br>pre-cancer<br>she's a pathology based pathology<br>trained clinician who is here in New<br>Zealand and plans to go back to Samar in<br>the future<br>the last piece of research I want to<br>talk about is involving associate<br>professor Peter Sykes who's at otago<br>University of otago Christchurch he's an<br>Ong surgeon and he's been a wonderful<br>of particular significance was his study<br>known as the princess study and this was<br>to look at women under the age of 25.<br>he was aware along with a number of<br>other people that there may have been<br>some over-treatment of women being<br>carried out particularly in a younger<br>woman<br>because a lot of younger women have<br>disease that will regress naturally<br>so he set up a study known as the<br>princess study where he looked at woman<br>who had this pre-cancer stage called<br>cervical intraepithelia neoplasia grade<br>two suntu and monitored them<br>observationally so instead of treating<br>them just monitored their progress and<br>treated them if they needed to be<br>treated<br>for us this was a wonderful opportunity<br>because it allowed us to look at women<br>who had disease that progressed and<br>woman who had disease that persisted or<br>regressed<br>any progressed disease was of course<br>we were interested in this particularly<br>and we continue to be interested in this<br>because with HPV testing we have a much<br>more specific test<br>but a lot of those women will still have<br>disease that regresses naturally so<br>don't doesn't they don't need to be<br>treated<br>if all those women go to colposcopy to<br>be looked at that's a lot of resource at<br>specialist services<br>and so that may provide problem issues<br>with access and they've shown in other<br>countries where they've introduced HPV<br>screening that there's about a<br>three-fold increase in colposcopy<br>referrals<br>so what we want is another test that can<br>be done at the same time as the HPV test<br>or it can at least be sampled at the age<br>at the same time we can then take that<br>sample and test it later if the woman is<br>HPV positive<br>and we want to look for markers that<br>relate more to disease<br>and here we've looked at the tissue<br>micro environment so here these are HPV<br>sun2 lesions and we've looked to see<br>what is related to progression in these<br>women and what's related to regression<br>so from this we can profile the good<br>things<br>particularly as we'd expect the helper T<br>cells the antigen presenting cells the<br>CD4 and the cd8 T cells<br>and we can look at the bad things the<br>things that are associated with<br>progression such as molecules such as<br>blimp one hmgb1 fox P3 so what we want<br>to identify is identify as determine a<br>biomarker that identifies disease that's<br>likely to progress<br>so we can make sure those women go to<br>colposcopy and the women who don't need<br>to treat be treated can be<br>observationally managed while the<br>so I hope today I've been able to<br>convince you that there is significant<br>benefit to translational research and<br>that basic biomedical research and<br>clinical research leads to improved<br>Health outcomes I've Illustrated this<br>through this journey with HPV vaccine<br>and HPV DNA testing which was all basic<br>biomedical research that is now part of<br>clinical management and treatment and<br>prevention for this cancer<br>it's those discoveries that have led to<br>the point where now the who<br>is declaring that by 2030 they want to<br>eliminate cervical cancer as a public<br>health issue and that's a global call I<br>feel like there's a lot of work to do to<br>achieve that but we certainly have some<br>several people mentioned my interest in<br>space so I couldn't really with a senior<br>leadership team here how could I avoid<br>reminding them of the importance of this<br>image here<br>thus as Dunedin<br>this is our new Dunedin Hospital<br>here we have a 1.4 billion dollar<br>investment in health care<br>what an opportunity because sitting over<br>here we have a bunch of basic biomedical<br>researchers and here we have a lot of<br>clinicians here you'll notice that we've<br>removed the existing hospital because<br>that's just in the way and no one will<br>want to be in there once we've got a new<br>one we've created this wonderful<br>Corridor to ensure that we have a<br>pathway for our basic biomedical<br>researchers and our clinical researchers<br>to get together to make the types of<br>discoveries that will translate into new<br>into improved Health outcomes and not<br>only that here is proposed a clinical<br>and translational research building<br>which is going to form the Hub of this<br>activity it's going to involve external<br>engagement with these Innovation<br>partners<br>this is something that is really going<br>to enhance this investment opportunity<br>that we see in Dunedin so as a city we<br>I would like to conclude by<br>acknowledging the extensive number of<br>staff and students I've had in the lab<br>over the years and they are listed here<br>and I really do acknowledge all of their<br>wonderful<br>contributions over the years and<br>contributions to This research and<br>continuing contributions and it's<br>wonderful to see some of those key<br>people in the audience here today<br>I'd like to acknowledge the funding<br>bodies that have supported This research<br>over the years<br>foreign<br>thank you so much for those of you who<br>don't know I am Allison Rich that I've<br>been head of the Department of pathology<br>at the Dunedin campus for two and a half<br>years now and I want to acknowledge<br>first of all your support as Deputy head<br>of Department Maryland<br>I also wanted to acknowledge all of the<br>work that you've done for the division<br>with the space thing I think you've just<br>shown us um<br>how you can<br>put your case across to an audience very<br>well but also for many years you've been<br>chair of the space committee for the<br>Department of pathology and that's a<br>smaller job but it's also one that has<br>been time consuming and tricky from time<br>to time so thank you for that but my<br>main job today is to thank you very much<br>for this presentation it was lovely to<br>see your journey<br>across this very interesting topic I<br>think it was great the way that you<br>weaved your mentors in into that talk<br>and the short time I've been in the<br>department I've seen how you are<br>bringing on your students and so in time<br>to come they will say those same<br>supportive things about you<br>just every time I have an opportunity as<br>an oral pathologist I just have to<br>strike that um that drum a little bit<br>and that's why I enjoyed that talk so<br>much as well because the vaccine against<br>um the oncogenic types of HPV is<br>obviously very important for cervical<br>cancer but sometimes not all but some<br>types of oral and oral Olympics or<br>facial and oropharyngeal Cancers are<br>associated with HPV virus infection as<br>well so we just can't wait to see what<br>the vaccine is going to do in the longer<br>terms to tonsillar and um oropharyngeal<br>cancer so it's another little thing so<br>in all Maryland just thank you so much<br>wonderful talk so nice and clear to keep<br>your audience it involved um so that<br>it's just great and it's my pleasure on<br>behalf of the University<br>to present you with this gift now I'm<br>I'm going to hand over now to Patricia<br>Trish priest our acting PVC Health<br>Sciences to conclude<br>thank you Allison<br>um Kira Koto so I'm Trish priest I'm the<br>acting Provost dancer of Health Sciences<br>which means that I also have to say how<br>much I value Maryland's support on space<br>and building matters because<br>I understand nothing and she's a steady<br>support and um very knowledgeable person<br>to have on committees<br>um<br>so I have the very easy and pleasant<br>task of inviting you for a cup of tea<br>and some refreshments in the staff Club<br>after this and to ask you to one more<br>time thank Marilyn for her really</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
