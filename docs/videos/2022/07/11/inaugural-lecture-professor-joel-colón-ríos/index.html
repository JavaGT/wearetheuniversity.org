Through the lecture, Professor Colón-Ríos reflect on the different ‘encounters’ with the concept of sovereignty through his academic work.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

broader public community<br>to the inaugural lecture<br>of professor of law<br>joel colandrios<br>in a coveted landscape<br>this inaugural has been a while coming<br>and it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>you here in person this evening<br>for any of our guests who may not know<br>me i'm jennifer windsor acting vice<br>chancellor of teherangawaka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>professor colon rios is an<br>internationally recognized expert<br>in the areas of constitutional theory<br>and comparative constitutional law<br>he joined our university in 2010<br>received an early career excellence<br>award research excellence award in 2013<br>and was named a professor in 2020<br>he has contributed significantly to the<br>faculty of law<br>most recently as director of the new<br>zealand centre for public law<br>joel is known for his thoughtful and<br>research-led approach to teaching he's<br>an extremely well-respected postgraduate<br>supervisor<br>achieving the postgraduate students<br>award supervisor of the year in 2017<br>he's also known for his calm<br>assured humble leadership style perhaps<br>especially visible throughout his time<br>as associate dean research when he<br>guided the faculty through a successful<br>effort to improve<br>the already excellent performance-based<br>research fund ranking<br>now professor colon rios's research and<br>scholarly portfolio is both extensive<br>and high quality and known for its<br>influence in both english and<br>spanish-speaking outlets<br>in 2017 he received a significant<br>marsden grant for research exploring<br>constituent power and the law that same<br>year he was elected to the puerto rican<br>academy of jurisprudence a branch of the<br>royal academy of spain<br>now i think all of these accolades are<br>truly substantive<br>but for me it is the cumulative<br>contribution and impact of joel's work<br>that this inaugural gives us a moment to<br>reflect on and to celebrate<br>it is the relevance and impact of his<br>thinking at the interface of legal and<br>political power and authority<br>about historical and contemporary<br>notions of sovereignty of constituent<br>power and the law<br>popular power and democracy that i think<br>we<br>applaud in terms of his elegant and<br>elegant argumentation of where power<br>resides<br>in his inaugural tonight joel will argue<br>that the concept of sovereignty supreme<br>power of a people state or parliament<br>remains critical to understanding<br>constitutional theory and constituent<br>power<br>he hypothesizes about how constituent or<br>popular power has been used in his words<br>to both limit and justify political<br>power<br>now in another context about his work<br>joel has said that even if you disagree<br>with me i hope you will find something<br>interesting<br>i have absolutely no doubt<br>that tonight we will find his inaugural<br>lecture<br>colombias it's my pleasure to introduce<br>professor joel colon rios and invite him<br>to the podium<br>thanks very much to the vice chancellor<br>for that very kind introduction and<br>thanks to all of you for being here<br>today<br>i'm sure this must be very common among<br>people giving inaugural lectures but my<br>greatest fear today was that i would be<br>giving a lecture to an empty room<br>and i mean i dipped down and knew that<br>petra butler would be here as well as<br>the pro-vice chancellor mckeefford and i<br>was pretty sure graciela and my kids<br>lucas and matthias would also come i<br>mean at least if there was no football<br>training that that night but i was<br>pretty sure that i could sort of<br>arranging so that there was no conflict<br>and what i want to say i think is that i<br>am really really grateful to see you all<br>here and colleagues friends former<br>former and current students members of<br>the judiciary and even family members<br>visiting from puerto rico<br>now before i begin i should warn you<br>that the lecture i have prepared for<br>today may be a bit dry and boring at the<br>beginning<br>and then throughout and to the very end<br>but<br>i do promise you that and you will learn<br>something not<br>necessarily about the subject matter of<br>the lecture sovereignty but about what i<br>think about it and which in the live<br>scheme of things is probably not very<br>important but here we are<br>okay so let's first say something<br>general about sovereignty i would like<br>to start by<br>looking at one of sovereignty's greatest<br>critics and what she said about it and<br>the person that i have in mind is hannah<br>arendt the great political theorist and<br>holocaust survivor<br>who in a 1960 lecture titled freedom and<br>the famous sovereignty of political<br>bodies has always been an illusion<br>which moreover can be maintained only by<br>the instruments of violence that is with<br>essentially non-political means under<br>human conditions which are determined by<br>the fact that not man but men with here<br>human beings live on the earth freedom<br>and sovereignty are so little identical<br>that they cannot even exist<br>simultaneously<br>where men wish to be suffering as<br>individuals or as organized groups they<br>must submit to the operation of the will<br>be this the individual will with which i<br>force myself or the genital will of an<br>organized group if men wish to be free<br>it is precisely sovereignty they have<br>or they must renounce<br>most of what i will say tonight will<br>appear to be in direct conflict with<br>this notion but at the end of the<br>lecture i will say yes that perhaps that<br>is not necessarily the case<br>okay so what what do i mean by by<br>sovereignty<br>from a legal or constitutional<br>perspective i think that sovereignty can<br>be defined as the political power to<br>transform any will into law<br>whoever is suffering possesses an<br>unlimited lawmaking power a power not<br>subject to any restraints<br>it is not difficult to see why this idea<br>which reminds of<br>of hope's leviathan is problematic on<br>the one hand in the contemporary world<br>there doesn't seem to be anyone holding<br>that kind of power<br>in fact here in new zealand duties like<br>lord cook and more recently sir kenneth<br>keys and sergio free palmer have many<br>times insisted on that point the idea is<br>that in a world where governments are<br>subject to different types of<br>international obligations<br>where even sovereign parliaments can<br>only adopt laws by going through complex<br>processes that impact in different ways<br>the ultimate content of particular<br>statutes it is almost impossible to find<br>a real sovereign to find someone some<br>entity that actually can adopt any law<br>it wants<br>so the point is that the content of the<br>law will not express the will of anyone<br>in particular<br>but will rather be a reflection of<br>different interests and forces<br>present in the social and political<br>domestic and international context where<br>the law is adopted<br>on the other hand<br>even if it was possible for there to be<br>actual sovereign entities<br>the question would become why would<br>we want such a thing to exist<br>why would we want anyone even if it is<br>an elected assembly to have the<br>political power to transform any will<br>into law<br>in fact one of the clearest indications<br>that there is something wrong in a<br>constitutional order is the existence of<br>an institution with the power to do<br>anything such an entity for example<br>would be able to engage in human rights<br>violations to intervene in the<br>adjudication of disputes to punish<br>individuals for conduct that hasn't been<br>classified as a crime and so on<br>through the lecture i will refer to this<br>as the problem of sovereignty<br>whoever has sovereignty is a potential<br>authoritarian<br>i would be human rights violator a<br>potential dictator and yet i will try to<br>convince you today that we should not<br>give up on the concept of sovereignty<br>that in fact we do need to recognize an<br>instance of sovereign authority<br>if we want to limit the exercise of<br>political power<br>how can this be<br>how can<br>it be that we need to retain the idea of<br>sovereignty the idea of an unrestrained<br>law making power if we want a power that<br>is not unlimited not on restraint<br>i have titled this lecture sovereign<br>encounters because what i will try to do<br>is to answer those questions by<br>reflecting on the ways in which i have<br>encountered the concept of sovereignty<br>at different stages of my academic life<br>and don't worry there are only four four<br>encounters<br>so the first encounter has to do with<br>the puerto rican political status debate<br>which was very present through my<br>undergraduate and law studies back in<br>puerto rico<br>currently as well as back then u.s<br>federal laws routinely apply in puerto<br>rico even though the island lacks voting<br>representation in the u.s federal<br>legislature<br>that is clearly an undemocratic state of<br>affairs which is why puerto rico's<br>current political status is generally<br>seen as a problem as a colonial problem<br>but note that this debate as all debates<br>about the colonization is ultimately<br>about sovereignty about who has<br>unlimited power over the island of<br>puerto rico at the moment it is the u.s<br>congress who has the power and the<br>question is should it be someone else<br>the claim by some groups in puerto rico<br>is that the people of the island should<br>be suffering that puerto rico should<br>become a sovereign country<br>that claim is a claim about<br>self-government a claim about puerto<br>rico being able to be ruled by its own<br>laws without being subject to u.s<br>interference<br>but it is also a claim about limiting<br>the limiting the power of the u.s over<br>puerto rico and this is very typical of<br>colonial contexts so for example when<br>new zealand became a de facto and then<br>at the yuri<br>the yuri sovereign country first by<br>convention and then through formal<br>constitutional independence the result<br>was not only that sovereign authority<br>over new zealand would now be located in<br>new zealand but also that the united<br>kingdom's law-making power over new<br>zealand diminished until it disappeared<br>as in the puerto rico example<br>placing sovereignty in new zealand was<br>at least partly a way of limiting<br>someone else's power the power of the<br>english parliament over aotearoa<br>a similar dynamic may be present in the<br>context of maori claims to sovereignty<br>on the facility of waitangi<br>as i understand them those claims to<br>sovereignty are not really about maori<br>wanting to exercise an unlimited law<br>making power but about limiting the<br>power of the crown over memory either by<br>preventing it from doing certain things<br>or by requiring it to do others so when<br>one thinks about sovereignty from this<br>perspective what happens is that a power<br>that is supposed to be absolute and<br>therefore dangerous<br>in practice plays a role of limiting the<br>power of some other entity now that does<br>not mean that the problem of sovereignty<br>the problem of someone having an<br>unlimited law making power a power that<br>could be abused<br>necessarily disappears because what<br>would normally happen<br>is that it is simply transferred to<br>someone else to puerto rico to new<br>zealand and so on<br>so the problem<br>is still there<br>and but as i will argue soon the concept<br>of sovereignty itself provides a way out<br>of it<br>this brings me to my second encounter<br>with sovereignty which took place during<br>my doctoral studies in canada<br>my my phd research<br>was about the theory of constituent<br>power and about how it allowed us to<br>understand the democratic legitimacy of<br>constitutional orders so let me briefly<br>explain what this was about<br>the theory of constituent power<br>whose origins are usually placed in the<br>french revolution is quite<br>straightforward so the idea is that in<br>every legal system it is said there is<br>someone who has the power to create a<br>constitution or to alter the existing<br>one in fundamental ways<br>a constitution is thus not simply the<br>product of history but a human artifact<br>that can be created and recreated by<br>human beings<br>during the during the french revolution<br>that idea was embraced and at the same<br>time constituent power was attributed to<br>an entity called nation<br>now that idea of the nation has an<br>interesting history and it was<br>originally not conceived as equivalent<br>to the people<br>but nowadays those two notions are used<br>interchangeably and<br>as i will do in the rest of the lecture<br>lecture and we usually talk about the<br>constituent power of the people that is<br>the power of the people to give itself<br>any constitution it wants<br>in the english constitutional tradition<br>the theory of constituent power has not<br>been very influential<br>but this is not the case in continental<br>europe and latin america as we will see<br>shortly so in my doctorate thesis i<br>argued that the democratic legitimacy of<br>a constitution depended on whether it<br>provided an opening for the future<br>exercise of constituent power<br>and for such an opening to be a<br>democratic opening<br>i argued it had to take the form of a<br>mechanism some kind of mechanism that<br>reproduced the kind of process that one<br>would expect in a democratic<br>constitution-making episode<br>for example a referendum that asks the<br>electorate whether they want to adopt a<br>new constitution followed by the<br>election of the delegates to a special<br>constitution-making body usually called<br>a constituent assembly which would then<br>draft a constitution that becomes valid<br>only if ratified in a further referendum<br>so my argument was that in order for a<br>constitution to be understood over time<br>as resting on a popular decision as been<br>democratically legitimate<br>it was not enough that it had been<br>originally created through that kind of<br>process<br>but that it was also open to future<br>replacement or future fundamental<br>changes through a similar procedure<br>moreover i argued that the process for<br>the<br>replacement of the existing constitution<br>had to be such<br>that it could be triggered from below<br>that is by the people themselves for<br>example by popular initiative and i will<br>that of course was not what one would<br>see in written constitutions around the<br>world<br>constitutions not only tends or tended<br>to be difficult or very difficult to<br>change but their change is usually put<br>in the exclusive hands of ordinary<br>legislatures for instance this is what<br>the typical amendment rule of a written<br>of course there are many variations of<br>this but you get the idea so in light of<br>the prevalence of that provision i<br>concluded that contemporary<br>constitutions were characterized by the<br>deficit of democratic legitimacy<br>they did not provide an opening for the<br>future exercise of constituent power<br>that is they did not provide mechanisms<br>of constitutional change or potential<br>constitutional replacement similar to<br>those that would be present in a<br>democratic constitution-making process<br>of course this sounded a bit too<br>demanding but around the same time i was<br>writing a number of constitutions began<br>to appear in latin america which<br>included provisions like the following<br>so this is article 4 11 of the<br>constitution of bolivia of 2009 the<br>total reform of the constitution there<br>is a less demanding process for what is<br>called the partial reform of the<br>constitution<br>or that which affects its fundamental<br>premises rights duties and guarantees or<br>the supremacy<br>of the uh and reform of the constitution<br>shall take place through an<br>original plain potentially constituent<br>assembly put into motion by popular will<br>through referendum<br>the convocation of the referendum shall<br>be<br>carried out by popular initiative with<br>the signatures of at least 20 percent of<br>the electorate by absolute majority vote<br>of the members of the pluri national<br>legislative assembly or by the president<br>of the state and of course i found this<br>quite interesting but what does it have<br>to do with sovereignty<br>well there were two main criticisms<br>about those kind of mechanisms as well<br>as against the kind of argument i was<br>presenting in my thesis and both of<br>these criticisms were based on the<br>notion of sovereignty<br>the first one was that by making<br>possible the convocation of what would<br>be for all purposes<br>and a sovereign entity<br>these mechanisms<br>created a constant possibility that a<br>democratic constitution would at some<br>point be replaced by an undemocratic<br>right violating or authoritarian one<br>second that by giving rise to a<br>sovereign entity an entity that could<br>claim to act as if it was the people<br>these kinds of provisions would result<br>in constitution making bodies that go<br>beyond the task they are given that is<br>the creation of a new constitution and<br>interfere with the ordinary institutions<br>of government<br>in fact throughout constitutional<br>history not only in latin america but<br>also in in europe and the united states<br>constitution making bodies have<br>frequently claimed to be the holders of<br>a sovereign power and<br>and have done things such as repeal or<br>amend ordinary legislation remove or<br>appoint judges and so on even though<br>they were only authorized to create a<br>new constitution<br>and the best historical example of this<br>is perhaps the french national<br>convention of 1793 which was convinced<br>to give france a new constitution but<br>ended up exercising all powers of<br>government including the judicial one<br>and less dramatic examples of of this<br>can also be observed in more recent time<br>in places like<br>colombia or venezuela to which i will<br>come back soon so this insect this<br>second encounter with sovereignty was<br>not as positive as the first one here<br>the emphasis was on the risks on the bad<br>side of sovereignty on the problem of<br>sovereignty<br>but then<br>in 2009 professor tony smith contacted<br>me offering me a position here at the<br>faculty of law and this led<br>me to my third encounter with<br>sovereignty in this case with the<br>doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty<br>and it also led me to meet so many<br>wonderful colleagues and students many<br>of whom i can see here today who have<br>taught me many things<br>and contributed to my thinking on these<br>very issues<br>now one thing i knew or that i thought i<br>knew about the doctrine of parliamentary<br>sovereignty is that a legislative body<br>operating under it is like like a<br>constituent assembly like a sovereign<br>constituent assembly in permanent<br>session<br>this is why<br>or this was the view<br>famously expressed by alexis de<br>tocqueville which um a view with which<br>dicey himself agreed and described and i<br>quote as a convenient formula for some<br>summing up the fact that parliament can<br>change any law whatever<br>so a sovereign parliament can engage in<br>fundamental constitutional changes any<br>time it wants it can also<br>adopt ordinary laws and if it really<br>wants to it could also interfere with<br>the exercise of the executive or the<br>judicial authority<br>but of course while all this may be true<br>in theory<br>it does not work that way in practice<br>and for example during the 20th and<br>early 21st centuries the new zealand<br>parliament engaged a number of times in<br>what could be described as fundamental<br>constitutional change so the bill of<br>rights 1990 the introduction of mmp 1993<br>the supreme court act 2003 were all<br>arguably changes that<br>if adopted elsewhere would be considered<br>fundamental now i was not in new zealand<br>when those changes took place but i<br>suspect that when parliament adopted<br>them it did not really look like a<br>sovereign entity<br>it did not look as an entity that could<br>simply transform any will into law<br>an entity for example whose mayor wished<br>to adopt a particular type of bill of<br>rights was enough to result in that<br>particular type of bill of rights<br>rather in adopting these acts the new<br>zealand parliament or in this context<br>the house of representatives went<br>through a series of processes that in<br>some way limited its ability to exercise<br>its otherwise legally unrestrained power<br>in the case of mmp those procedure<br>processes included a referendum and in<br>the context of the bill of rights and<br>the supreme court act there was no<br>referendum but the consultation<br>processes and discussions that took<br>place before those bills were enacted<br>meant that in practice<br>it would be odd to describe them as<br>resulting from an exercise of a sort of<br>unrestrained lawmaking authority now<br>this will all be very familiar to you<br>and<br>but the rather obvious point perhaps<br>that i wish to make is that even though<br>legally speaking the new zealand<br>parliament is suffering politically is<br>it is not and this was of course<br>something that was recognized by daisy<br>himself<br>when daisy described the english<br>parliament as a sovereign entity he was<br>very clear<br>that that sovereignty had a strictly<br>legal nature its implement that once<br>parliament enacted once there was an act<br>of parliament<br>a law<br>that law cannot be changed repealed or<br>invalidated by any other institution<br>unless of course parliament explicitly<br>granted that power<br>but if parliament is only legally<br>suffering<br>and i think this was<br>an important part of dice's point it<br>means that it is not fully sovereign<br>that is to say sovereignty is ultimately<br>a political concept it is about someone<br>who holds a political power to transform<br>its will into law so if parliament has<br>only legal sovereignty it is because<br>political sovereignty lies somewhere<br>else and for dicey that someone was the<br>nation of the or the electoral um body<br>so he wrote for example<br>here we come round to the fundamental<br>document of modern constitutionalism the<br>legal sovereignty of parliament is<br>subordinate to the political sovereignty<br>of the nation<br>this is why he said there are some laws<br>that even if parliament is legally<br>entitled to adopt it would<br>never adopt for example a law that is on<br>just that it may result in massive acts<br>of civil disobedience or in a revolution<br>or simply in an electoral defeat or a<br>law that abolishes democracy or that<br>involves in serious violations of human<br>rights<br>and in the same way that there are laws<br>that parliament would never adopt there<br>are others that parliament would be<br>politically bound to adopt<br>for example laws that were promised by<br>the parliamentary majority during a<br>political campaign and of course none of<br>this always works in the same way for<br>example parliament may sometimes fail<br>to legislate in the way desired by the<br>majority of the electorate<br>but the point is that there is a limit<br>to the extent to which parliament would<br>be willing and able to act because it is<br>not politically sovereignty sovereign so<br>this third encounter the encounter with<br>parliamentary sovereignty was about<br>understanding the different reasons why<br>a law-making body by the mere fact of<br>possessing a legally unlimited<br>law-making authority is not necessarily<br>a<br>fully sovereign entity<br>now the force<br>and final encounter is about the way in<br>which that idea applies or not to<br>constituent<br>assemblies<br>as i suggested earlier constituent<br>assemblies<br>um are typically understood as sovereign<br>constitution making bodies<br>and the reason is simple<br>they are seen as sovereign entities<br>because they are specifically convinced<br>to exercise a power that belongs to the<br>people the constituent power<br>a power that is greater than the<br>legislative executive or the<br>judicial authority<br>so it is the power to determine how all<br>those other powers<br>are to be exercised<br>now from the perspective of legal<br>sovereignty this makes sense because if<br>the exercise of constituent power was<br>subject to legal limits<br>it would mean that societies would be<br>unable to adopt certain types of<br>constitutions but there is no reason why<br>constituent assemblies must also be<br>conceived as politically sovereign<br>in the same way that a sovereign<br>parliament is sometimes understood as a<br>constituent assembly a constituent<br>assembly could be understood as a<br>sovereign parliament<br>as as a legally but not politically<br>sovereign entity however despite what<br>you might think at this point<br>that is not what i want to say<br>because that conception would<br>fundamentally misunderstand what a<br>constituent assembly is in fact what i<br>want to argue is that a constituent<br>assembly properly properly understood is<br>not even legally suffering<br>so why is that how how can that be<br>remember that a constituent assembly is<br>tasked with the exercise of constituent<br>power but that power does not belong to<br>the assembly but to someone else<br>that is it belongs to the entity that<br>passed the assembly and that entity is<br>the people the sovereign people<br>so being called to exercise constituent<br>power does not mean to be suffering it<br>actually means the opposite that there<br>is a suffering who cannot exercise its<br>constituent power by itself cannot<br>assemble and draft a constitution and<br>has therefore someone else to do so on<br>its behalf<br>so there is an important distinction<br>that constitutional theory i think has<br>historically failed to make a<br>distinction between constituent power<br>and sovereignty so all sovereigns have<br>constituent power but not every entity<br>who exercises constituent power is<br>suffering<br>believe it or not this seemingly<br>abstract and perhaps trivial distinction<br>between constituent power and<br>sovereignty can have important practical<br>implications so i mentioned colombia and<br>venezuela some minutes ago so in those<br>two countries in colombia in 1991 and in<br>venezuela in 1999 constituent assemblies<br>were convinced<br>once convened these entities expressly<br>proclaimed themselves sovereign and<br>engaged to different extents in the<br>exercise of the ordinary powers of<br>government for example they suspended<br>the ordinary legislature and engaged in<br>different degrees of intervention with<br>the judicial power<br>from the perspective of these<br>constituent assemblies this was entirely<br>justified because the assemblies had<br>been directly elected by the people and<br>could therefore act as if they were the<br>people so that if they thought that the<br>legislature or the judiciary were not<br>acting for the common good they could<br>and in fact it was their duty to take<br>actions against those institutions<br>this mode of proceeding was challenged<br>in the courts<br>and in those cases judges determined<br>that constituent assemblies by virtue of<br>being constituent assemblies<br>of having been tasked to exercise<br>were sovereign entities that could not<br>be limited by law not surprisingly that<br>kind of view which is by far the<br>dominant view in latin america has given<br>constituent assemblies a bad name<br>and this is reflected in the<br>constitution making process which is now<br>in its last stages in chile<br>if you look at the official documents<br>related to that process<br>you will find no mention of the words<br>constituent power or constituent<br>assembly<br>the drafting entity for example was<br>called a constitutional convention a<br>constitutional convention and i think<br>the reason behind this was precisely an<br>attempt to avoid<br>suffering a sovereign<br>constitution-making body of the kind<br>other latin american countries have<br>experienced in fact the enabling rules<br>of the convention which were inserted as<br>an amendment to the current constitution<br>explicitly<br>explicitly stated<br>the convention any of its members<br>or a fraction of them shall not best in<br>themselves the exercise of sovereignty<br>assuming other functions than those<br>expressly recognized by this<br>constitution so it seems that chile<br>attempted to avoid the confusion between<br>constituent power and sovereignty by at<br>least to some extent leaving behind the<br>notion of constituent power but that<br>would not have been necessary if<br>constituent assemblies had been<br>understood as what they are mechanisms<br>for the exercise of constituent power<br>not sovereign entities and this leads me<br>to my final point which is connected to<br>my earlier comment that despite what<br>dicey and the talk bill thought there is<br>a key difference between a suffering<br>parliament and a constituent assembly<br>and the difference is this<br>unlike sovereign parliaments constituent<br>assemblies may be subject to legally<br>enforceable limits that is that in<br>certain scenarios a constituent assembly<br>may be legally bound to adopt certain<br>type of constitutional content<br>what i mean is the following so<br>constituent assemblies are usually<br>convened<br>after a referendum that asks a question<br>like this<br>do you wish to convene a constituent<br>assembly for the adoption of a new<br>constitution so that's sort of the<br>typical question but imagine for example<br>a referendum question where the<br>electorate is asked instead<br>do you wish to convene a constituent<br>assembly for the adoption of a new<br>constitution that establishes a<br>unicameral legislature and a supreme<br>beat of rights<br>if constituent assemblies are suffering<br>then they can legally disregard<br>a positive answer to that kind of<br>question just as a sovereign parliament<br>can legally disregard a referendum<br>result as it has happened in new zealand<br>as a number of times<br>but now we know that constituent<br>assemblies are not suffering so the<br>question is would a constituent assembly<br>that has been convened<br>after a referendum like the ones<br>suggested by the slide be able to<br>disregard the instruction to create a<br>particular type of constitutional<br>content<br>or would the instruction or mandate<br>contained in the referendum question be<br>now in the case of a sovereign<br>parliament it is clear that a mandate<br>contained in a referendum would not be<br>legally enforceable but it is not so<br>clear i think in the case of a<br>constituent assembly at least of a<br>constituent assembly that is convened in<br>a country which already operates under a<br>written constitution<br>in such a context the ordinary rules of<br>courts would usually involve the<br>enforcement of another instruction from<br>the people that is to say the<br>constitution itself<br>the constitution after all is a popular<br>mandate that establishes different types<br>of limits for example limits about what<br>kind of ordinary laws can be legally<br>adopted<br>so with relation to a written<br>constitution<br>the people is not merely a political<br>suffering as in dice's theory it is<br>simply that sovereign<br>and in the same way that courts enforce<br>the popular mandate contained in a<br>written constitution against for example<br>an ordinary legislature<br>courts could or should also be able to<br>enforce the popular mandate contained in<br>a referendum question against the entity<br>thus to exercise constituent power on<br>the people's behalf so sovereignty even<br>a unified conception of sovereignty one<br>that does not distinguish between legal<br>and political sovereignty can serve to<br>limit<br>the power of a type of entity in this<br>case a constituent assembly that has<br>historically been seen as unlimited by<br>definition<br>and this is what i think are part of why<br>i think that sovereignty is still very<br>much a valuable constitutional concept<br>the true sovereign the people only comes<br>to<br>close to exercising its sovereign<br>authority during a constitution-making<br>moment when it asks<br>an institution for example a constituent<br>assembly to exercise constituent power<br>on its behalf from then on its<br>sovereignty popular sovereignty only<br>serves to limit the political power of<br>everyone else<br>now at the start of the lecture i<br>suggested that my sort of defense of<br>sovereignty<br>may after all be consistent with the<br>type of critique advanced by hannah<br>arendt<br>in fact<br>in the same lecture that i referred to<br>at the beginning aaron said<br>that<br>the freedom of one man or a group or a<br>body politic can only be purchased at<br>the price of the freedom<br>that is the sovereign of all others<br>and i think that that is in a certain<br>way my view in order to be free one must<br>free oneself from the sovereignty of<br>others but in doing so i think that one<br>inevitably becomes sovereign oneself<br>perhaps once one has achieved that the<br>next step<br>is to find a way of getting rid of<br>sovereignty itself but whether that can<br>be done without giving up the ideal of<br>democratic self-government is a question<br>for another day<br>so<br>welcome<br>those of you who don't know me my name<br>is mark hickford and i'm the pro vice<br>chancellor of government law and<br>business<br>here at this university it is my<br>distinct privilege to propose a vote of<br>thanks<br>in the wake of a marvelous<br>exposition of<br>sovereignty<br>we celebrate joel and give thanks for<br>his inaugural lecture<br>i've endeavoured to write notes as<br>you've been speaking joel to try and<br>capture perhaps some things i can<br>distill<br>but first i should note that<br>not only have you regaled us<br>with the story of a life lived through<br>encounters<br>sovereign encounters as lived through<br>puerto rico canada and now aotearoa new<br>zealand<br>but you also<br>deserve to have acknowledged the<br>presence of your family here this<br>evening<br>so glacier the children<br>and i'm very grateful also i understand<br>carlos your father-in-law is also<br>present so thank you very much<br>it's wonderful to see you<br>i should perhaps start<br>with a contribution that joel made<br>in the year<br>of his professorship<br>in 2020<br>the closing words of his important book<br>constituent power and the law<br>which was published through oxford<br>university press<br>joel argued and this may resonate given<br>what we've just heard<br>as in rousseau it is the sovereign<br>people and not its representatives we<br>must determine the content<br>of the fundamental laws<br>if those laws are not respected<br>the constitution making body<br>would<br>as with napoleon bonaparte in 1804 be<br>crowning itself as the true sovereign<br>which was seen as an unpalatable point<br>of view<br>in saying this<br>joelle acknowledges that he has<br>encountered a challenge<br>a problematic to tussle with in his<br>ongoing research<br>this is of course<br>an inextricable part<br>of the excitement and provocation<br>of the research endeavor step by step<br>joelle ambitiously encounters large<br>concepts<br>that not only harbor human as well as<br>consensual intentions and problems<br>but also try<br>to conceal those tensions or to render<br>them seemingly much more peaceable or<br>placatable<br>he faces up to this<br>his focus on sovereignty and constituent<br>power are magnificent examples of such<br>large concepts and concerns<br>in this effort joel knows very well that<br>the concealing and surface peacemaking<br>can fail if it is not well attuned to<br>what sensitivities<br>perspectives and aspirations<br>constitution making might try to hide or<br>to temper<br>in the accounts of jean bowdan<br>and thomas hobbs for instance<br>sovereignty had practical<br>and theoretical work to do<br>dealing with a seething mass of<br>competing parts<br>each fragment presenting itself as the<br>principle or preferred site for finality<br>for authoritatively narrating what the<br>politically meaningful community was<br>is and will be<br>even if in conversation with others<br>joel colan rios encounters these matters<br>head-on<br>his work is multi-directional<br>his meticulous scholarship and legal<br>philosophy travels through assorted past<br>the conundrums of the contemporary 21st<br>century and possible futures<br>i find his work captivating<br>because he will expand considerable time<br>puzzling over emmanuel sears in the late<br>18th century<br>while also actively engaging with live<br>questions<br>of the moment in venezuela chile or<br>brazil<br>he contributes the diversity of thought<br>bringing to our attentions the work of<br>thereby testing assumptions cherished in<br>common law jurisdictions<br>as bodhan and hobbes and<br>numerous others observed one can be<br>ecumenical as to where and in whom<br>sovereignty is specifically located<br>there are options they would claim<br>but jean-jacques rousseau and others<br>held otherwise<br>for russo as joelle reminds us the<br>people was it period<br>these are some of the challenges and<br>provocations that joel wishes to pursue<br>as he gazes ahead<br>because he finds himself in these<br>islands where the implications of<br>sovereignty how it might be construed<br>and navigated<br>how it might be narrated and deployed in<br>practice and theory<br>resonates meaningfully and powerfully<br>in 2014 the waitangi tribunal issued its<br>report on stage one of the tier taparahi<br>or teraki inquiry<br>here<br>as joel knows<br>that tribunal panel found that rangatira<br>did not cede any sovereignty that te<br>territi or waitangi would be a basis for<br>equal authorities coexisting<br>the practical effect of which would be<br>negotiated over time<br>case by case<br>and there are resonances here<br>for how he talks about<br>the mechanics<br>of the task that sovereigns set<br>administrative bodies and other<br>branches to do<br>joelle started tonight with hannah<br>arendt<br>and an essay published in 1960.<br>in that essay arendt preferred to focus<br>on the dynamic actuality of humans<br>living and being among others<br>inter-hominess<br>which requires us even with disparate<br>motivations<br>to converge for joint enterprises of<br>vital action<br>to dispute and to persuade one another<br>non-violently<br>iran to characterize this as freedom for<br>politics<br>rather than freedom from politics<br>that is a stress on active<br>self-government or rule under laws<br>and a power to act as opposed to merely<br>emphasizing rights or liberties from<br>interference<br>she was concerned with any trend whereby<br>the emphasis shifted from action to<br>willpower<br>such that the ideal of freedom ceased to<br>be virtuosity of acting and concert with<br>others and became sovereignty<br>the independence from others and the<br>ability if necessary to prevail against<br>them<br>that is why she argued that freedom is<br>only given to persons<br>under the condition of non-sovereignty<br>vigilance is required not complacency<br>why not one cannot take the res publica<br>the public thing for granted in these<br>times of mass communities<br>joelle is intrigued as to how popular<br>sovereignty contributes to or limits<br>these possibilities for positive action<br>we have heard his intonations on this<br>aspect this very night<br>secondly and relatedly he wishes to<br>think through another set of sovereignty<br>encounters or should we say<br>entanglements<br>in her 1963 publication on revolution<br>arendt argued that constitutions obtain<br>enduring authority<br>to the degree that the act of foundation<br>involves a people constituting its own<br>government<br>rather than a government or even<br>branches of the government imposing one<br>from above<br>joel's research trajectory will engage<br>with this some more<br>the notion<br>of the singular collective of the people<br>can conceal the political imaginary<br>underlying what is outwardly constituted<br>or constructed<br>as joelle has been talking about this<br>evening<br>civil peace the set of values<br>institutions laws and symbols<br>through which people imagine their<br>social whole<br>but what of people's political<br>imaginaries and contention with one<br>another<br>what are those communities coexisting<br>with others in a territorial space that<br>bring different ontological logics<br>theories of being and seeing to their<br>relations and entanglements with others<br>who then are the people in sovereignty<br>talk<br>and what burden does the definite<br>article<br>bear consequently and what work does it<br>do<br>joelle is starting to<br>give rise to these questions<br>treaty making as we know was and is seen<br>as one of the key attributes of<br>sovereignty the famed london-born new<br>zealand historian the political thought<br>john pocock<br>argued that sovereignty involves<br>narrating one's histories with others<br>whether strangers or companions in one's<br>communities<br>the act of doing so is the act of<br>sovereign communities<br>indeed more than two decades ago koko<br>wrote there will be at least two such<br>histories<br>in the islands of aotearoa almost<br>certainly more taking into account the<br>probable probable complexity of each<br>historic community<br>and all such histories must be recorded<br>and must be perceived as still being<br>enacted<br>we must find room for the concept of a<br>treaty between histories each being<br>recognised as performed by sovereigns<br>in an increasingly complex and<br>problematic associative sovereignty<br>and the exercise of sovereignty will<br>entail the narrating and performing of<br>histories in an intimate negotiation<br>with one another<br>james tully's world of strange<br>multiplicity<br>constitutionalism in an age of diversity<br>published back in 1995 is evocative here<br>where many histories and modes of<br>sovereignty have to talk to one another<br>or perhaps talk past each other<br>refraining from encounter and<br>entanglement whilst in reality failing<br>to be disentangled<br>along these threads of thought we can<br>expect to hear more from joel in<br>communion with our wonderful colleagues<br>in this place tehringawaka and across<br>the seas<br>joel your faculty the faculty of law<br>your university is so grateful glad<br>and heartened to have you counted among<br>the professors of this university<br>before i ask<br>our companions here this evening to join<br>us for refreshments in the foyer ask<br>that we all join in applause in this<br>vote of thanks thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
