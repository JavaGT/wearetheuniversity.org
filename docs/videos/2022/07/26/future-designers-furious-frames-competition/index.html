Here at the  <br>School of Design Innovation, we are <br>challenging you to create your own  <br>48-frame looping animation. Now you probably <br>already know what animation is, but just in case,  <br>animation is the illusion of motion through <br>static imagery. Animation is everywhere now;  <br>whether it's film, television, video games, any <br>kind of content being presented on screen probably  <br>has some form of animation. We are challenging <br>you to create your own, but there is a catch...<br>We're giving you a maximum of 48 frames. <br>You can use less, but you can't use anymore.  <br>What we mean by a looping animation is an <br>animation that cleanly returns from its end  <br>frame to its starting frame creating a seamless <br>transition. Now we've outlined the rules,  <br>but the content of the animation is entirely up <br>to you. So you can let your creativity run wild.  <br>You can submit to Instagram, Youtube <br>or Twitter, or you can email us  <br>at futuredesigners@vuw.ac.nz Make sure your <br>submissions are in by the following date!<br>And with that said, we wish you good luck, and <br>we look forward to seeing your submissions.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
