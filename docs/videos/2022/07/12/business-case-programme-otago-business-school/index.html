darius also<br>a few standout competitions for me so<br>far have been the hong kong hsbc<br>competition<br>uh the national finals and also the<br>toronto queens entrepreneurship<br>competition i think the real highlight<br>for me getting into all of these was<br>simply just all the skills and all the<br>people you meet along the way both in<br>terms of judges and networking that way<br>but also just connecting with<br>like-minded students as well<br>i feel like both of us have gained a lot<br>of practical skills for professional<br>development<br>uh like communication and answering<br>questions and problem solving which is<br>all gonna look great on our cv and it's<br>also just been a ton of fun and really<br>can't hype it up enough absolutely i<br>think the president all the president<br>presenting skills have really helped me<br>come a long way as well i recently did<br>an internship with timuru district<br>council over the summer and one of the<br>comments i got when i first started<br>presenting was wow where did you learn<br>to present because no one expected an<br>intern to have any presentation skills<br>and business case comps gave me some of<br>those<br>on the day when you come in you<br>get<br>either assigned to a team or join the<br>team you've pre-organized and get placed<br>in a room with your own business case<br>which is just a business problem<br>that some organization is facing and you<br>ask a simple question<br>how do we solve this issue<br>from there you'll take some time to read<br>through the case<br>think about what's the best way forward<br>brainstorm ideas and then put together<br>your ideas into a piece of solution<br>which you'll present to the judges at<br>the end of the case competition<br>it definitely requires a lot of teamwork<br>and um time management is like one of<br>our huge tips um if you're looking to uh<br>compete in the business case competition<br>because it's about four hours in a room<br>and that seems like a lot of time but<br>once you're in there you'll find that it<br>i definitely think yeah it's an<br>important part of the process is trying<br>to figure out uh the different roles<br>that people are going to play in the<br>team um<br>usually<br>people who like to kind of just be in<br>the background might be interested in<br>maybe like helping out slides and the<br>solution and<br>finances but it's really flexible um in<br>terms of that and<br>i think like when it comes to presenting<br>to just giving everybody an opportunity<br>to speak and also prompting other people<br>if you know that they would have a good<br>answer to a question that's just been<br>asked um<br>and yeah it can be difficult sometimes<br>because uh you know you get really<br>excited and you're all wanting to talk<br>at once but um yeah working well as a<br>team together is uh something that's<br>really important in terms of case<br>competitions what do you think darius<br>i think you've got a pretty<br>comprehensive answer there but i'll just<br>add<br>a lot of people study things like maybe<br>someone will study finance in the team<br>or they'll study marketing or such like<br>swell and you can often use those skills<br>or more so their interests to kind of<br>find a role for them in the team<br>but that is an exclusive so at the end<br>of the day you might have lots of people<br>who are studying finance in which case<br>you'll need to divide up other parts of<br>the team or vice versa so it's really<br>it's based on people's interests and<br>just working together with the team to<br>one of the great things that i really<br>liked even starting off my first case<br>comp in the business school was<br>jude managed to get a selection of<br>professionals<br>all that down to kind of to act as<br>judges and after all the judging went<br>through and after we got lots of<br>feedback we just had some time to kind<br>of sit around talk with all these judges<br>these people in the industry and say<br>what did we do can you tell me about<br>this or even hey can you tell me about<br>your role or how did you get into that<br>as well so that was pretty awesome i've<br>managed to stay connected with a few<br>people from international case comps<br>just from building relationships across<br>zoom and such like through these case<br>comps in terms of networking case<br>competitions have taught me a lot there<br>and i'm really<br>grateful for that because before i<br>started case competitions i wasn't even<br>using linkedin um but<br>now it's just like a great opportunity<br>to connect with other professionals and<br>other students and um kind of keep up<br>with what they're up to and also be able<br>to um share a little bit with them about<br>like what you've been up to so yeah<br>the biggest difference<br>for us was definitely<br>competing in the hsbc competition um<br>because of the cultural differences and<br>i think that was a great opportunity to<br>learn a little bit more about um asian<br>culture and um<br>some of the little cultural nuances<br>there and so in terms of presenting we<br>had to<br>um<br>like<br>learn little subtle things that we might<br>not think about um when we're presenting<br>in new zealand like um you know like how<br>do we look are we smiling are we like<br>super enthusiastic and<br>uh what would you<br>say there darius<br>i think that was i think you're<br>absolutely right about that it was a big<br>takeaway for us where<br>almost you're kind of moving on to a lot<br>more zoom competitions you're<br>you're almost there on the screen and<br>everyone's looking at you so you have to<br>be really careful<br>still but kind of smiling and happy and<br>things there<br>well with some of the other case comps<br>we've done you're almost<br>so far away from the camera that as soon<br>as you've stopped presenting you're<br>no longer in the frame and you can kind<br>of step out of it so it's almost the<br>constant<br>engagement you have to be with some<br>some competitions but not with others<br>yeah there's like a lot more focus on<br>your face whereas like<br>in like when you're in real life you<br>might be like moving your hands and<br>making gestures and stuff so it's very<br>different<br>i remember my friend asking me to come<br>along and compete and<br>i remember on that exact day just being<br>super nervous and not knowing really<br>what to expect but um yeah definitely<br>exceeded my expectations and<br>i'm basically addicted at this point i<br>really enjoy them<br>keep coming back so<br>i started off just simply i saw an<br>advert in the elevator and i was like<br>right that seems quite interesting and<br>so i went around to talk to the person<br>who was organizing that that was jude<br>and said hey you know i'm interested can<br>you tell me more and since then i've<br>signed up and while i kept on signing up<br>kept getting kept staying really really<br>interested and really enjoying it and<br>it's just kept learning so much every<br>time i do another taste comp so it's<br>gotten better and better i didn't expect<br>i think the best thing just to remember<br>is<br>you're not the only one who's nervous or<br>scared or worried anything's there and<br>so it means that everybody else is kind<br>of in that same boat so you don't need<br>to be scared about approaching someone<br>or talking to someone or even being put<br>in a group because everybody's just<br>learning and the judges are just there<br>to enjoy their day and just see what<br>kind of you guys to offer but there's<br>never any stress and no pressure it's<br>all about just developing your own<br>skills<br>yeah definitely agree that doesn't<br>really matter on the outcome as well or<br>like how well you do on the day because<br>even if it's your first time you just<br>learn so much and um you know that's the<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
