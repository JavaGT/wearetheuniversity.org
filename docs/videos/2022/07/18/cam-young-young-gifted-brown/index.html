0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i was actually raised in the third<br>gender of the cook islands so that is<br>akova and i think that's really<br>important because the third gender of<br>the cook island has a function within<br>the household and so that function of<br>that third gender is really important<br>part of my identity<br>kiorana my name is kem came in with<br>young i was born and raised in the<br>beautiful hawke's bay and i'm in my<br>third year of a bachelor of science at<br>the university of otago i am 20 years<br>old and a virgo<br>so my major is in anastomy which is the<br>study of the human body and with my<br>minor in pacific island studies i<br>recently started a role at tifari tafuru<br>which is the university's sexual<br>violence prevention and support unit i<br>do mentoring i have this passion and<br>this desire to be a pacific researcher<br>maybe a pacific lecturer in the future i<br>also do a bit of tutoring on the side<br>i'm involved with our student politics<br>and student associations here at the<br>university<br>and you're like 20.<br>so i'm the youngest of six kids i was<br>raised by a solo mum<br>my mum is my real life superhero she<br>raised us six kids as well as providing<br>for us really awesome opportunities to<br>grow and develop on my 17th birthday<br>when i baked a rainbow cake and came out<br>as gay to everyone it was a real<br>real turning point in my life<br>i say that because that's a big part of<br>my journey and coming down to otago this<br>is a time not of hibernation anymore but<br>a season of giving and a season of life<br>for me step into my identity a little<br>bit more and become who i want to be in<br>life<br>so i live in a five bedroom flat it is<br>nice and cozy and warm there are<br>four other young women who live here<br>with me all pacific<br>our flat is really cool because it's<br>part of a big complex and it's full of<br>pacific people like rosella who like to<br>sneak by and seal our food<br>our pacific community here is so<br>supportive and tight-knit and we're<br>always advocating for one another there<br>are a few specific students in the<br>papers that i take so my major is in<br>enes me which is the study of the human<br>body<br>in some classes you'd be lucky to get<br>maybe five other pacific students yes it<br>does<br>get a little bit<br>terrifying at times to step into a an<br>environment that's predominantly<br>pakia but i think that builds a lot of<br>resilience and a lot of strength in our<br>pacific students<br>i think we're really lucky here at the<br>university of otago because we have a<br>really awesome division of health<br>sciences<br>specifically a centre for pacific house<br>and pacific island research student and<br>support unit<br>and there are no<br>wrong answers everything will be right<br>because it is up to your interpretation<br>there's the ideas of physical health<br>mental health spiritual health<br>and there are a lot of different pacific<br>indigenous researchers who are looking<br>into all of those different topics and<br>so as a collective and as a community<br>we're all targeting this idea of pacific<br>health so that hopefully we can create a<br>bit<br>a better health system a better<br>education system for our new pacific<br>tower who are coming through<br>my minor in pacific island studies is so<br>awesome for me because i get to learn<br>about our pacific peoples and learn<br>about our history our development our<br>strengths which is really important as<br>well as perhaps things that we need to<br>work on combining an sme and pacific<br>island studies is a really unique mix of<br>disciplines and of subjects but i found<br>that there are still so many great<br>opportunities that come from that in<br>research volunteering community work as<br>something i'm really passionate about is<br>sexual and reproductive wellbeing of<br>pacific peoples so that's the idea of<br>not just<br>gender sexuality<br>gender expression but also the concepts<br>of contraception<br>safe relationships<br>one of the biggest challenges about<br>being pacific in a western institution<br>is the idea that we have differing world<br>views and so when we view things like<br>reproductive well-being reproductive<br>biology we see in a very<br>tapu lens in a very different way than<br>non-pacific people<br>often our pacific understandings of<br>these taboo topics<br>acts as an inhibitor and so we're not<br>able to experience learning the way as<br>the way non-pacific people do<br>we understand what these topics are but<br>we don't necessarily have the vocabulary<br>to express that i think with a little<br>bit more effort and compassion for our<br>pacific students we'll be able to equip<br>them with those skills in order to<br>be champions and be pioneers in the<br>future<br>i didn't see anyone else that looked<br>like me growing up proudly pacific<br>probably queer<br>proudly a nerd which i am<br>and so not only do i need to understand<br>what it means to be specific myself but<br>i need to understand it in a way that i<br>can give it back and share it back to<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
