and<br>friends<br>distinguished guests<br>academic and professional colleagues<br>students and our wider community<br>to the inaugural lecture of professor of<br>human resource management jane bryson<br>i'm jennifer windsor acting vice<br>chancellor and it is actually really<br>good it's a pleasure for me to welcome<br>you here this evening<br>i'm really pleased to be joined by<br>chancellor john allen<br>by other colleagues from council from<br>colleagues from the senior leadership<br>team and from around the university<br>i think if you looked around this room<br>this would be one of the most diverse<br>audiences for an inaugural from all<br>parts of the community and i think that<br>speaks a great deal to professor<br>bryson's impact<br>i think that all in all girls are<br>moments of celebration and to hear about<br>the significant research and scholarship<br>of our professors<br>and for me it's a particular pleasure<br>tonight to also acknowledge professor<br>bryson's scholarship in the wider<br>context of her role as dean of the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government as well as having previously<br>been acting pro vice chancellor<br>jane happens to be a globally recognized<br>expert in human resource management<br>she joined our university in 1999<br>bringing with her extensive<br>international experience as a human<br>resources manager organizational<br>psychologist and management consultant<br>during her academic career she's also<br>been associate dean of research as well<br>as deputy dean<br>and perhaps related to her area of<br>scholarship she has only shown<br>exceptional management and leadership<br>jane is highly regarded across the<br>university for her judicious her<br>pragmatic her assured and her very human<br>approach to leadership<br>she was named a professor in 2021<br>jane's research focuses on achieving<br>human capability through work<br>i think her scholarship is quite<br>remarkable in its breadth spanning as it<br>does several work sectors<br>and just as a few examples of her<br>overall body of work<br>james raised issues about the<br>questionable value of a policy focus on<br>individual work skills<br>she's introduced to new conceptual<br>models for analyzing cultural change and<br>the dynamics of organizational change<br>she's looked at the role of the<br>collective voice of trade unions as a<br>mechanism for worker participation she's<br>examined employee resilience and<br>managing growth during challenging times<br>now these are all issues at the very<br>contemporary heart of how we work and<br>how we live<br>her work is highly influential and she<br>is a preeminent point of contact for<br>employers and hr professionals for<br>government working parties and for<br>ministerial advisory committees and an<br>expert witness<br>as well as being a preeminent point of<br>contact within our academic communities<br>it's no question her work is hugely<br>impactful<br>and i would argue that her work has real<br>impact and meaning not only because it<br>lies at the intersection of theory<br>methods and practice<br>it's also because her overall body of<br>work drives us to ask quite challenging<br>questions about how we work and about<br>how we live<br>and tonight jane will explore issues<br>related to how to facilitate the<br>development of human capability and the<br>value of multiple perspectives in human<br>resource management<br>elsewhere jane has been quoted as saying<br>this<br>workers aspire to live lives they have<br>reason to value<br>and<br>that human contributions to society<br>are not wholly through work<br>and organizational contributions to<br>society are not wholly economic<br>and if you've noticed in her very cheeky<br>invitation to her in all girl you'll<br>have seen the presentation subtitle<br>autonomous skilled individuals<br>or compliant clog<br>cog not clogged<br>although it could be both we don't know<br>until we hear the inaugural<br>autonomous skilled individuals or<br>compliant cog in a machine<br>and i think with those kinds of<br>provocation i think we're in for a real<br>treat tonight from a highly accomplished<br>scholar<br>kia ora out to jain<br>thank you<br>many congratulations on your<br>professorship<br>would everyone please help me welcome<br>you<br>me<br>the uber

more likely we would have been<br>enslaved<br>as a result of conquest or capture<br>we could have turned up at a rural<br>hiring fair established in the 14th<br>century to combat labour shortages after<br>the plague<br>maybe we'll have to have them again<br>we might have been bought off by the<br>king's shilling<br>press ganged into service at sea<br>in more recent centuries we might

economy<br>history classics anthropology<br>law<br>take your pick of great people across<br>this entire university and in this room<br>could weave this explanation explanation<br>with more precision than i<br>what leads a human resource management<br>academic<br>educated in psychology to be concerned<br>with such things<br>well<br>the answer to that lies in two areas<br>first in the academic field of hrm human<br>resource management<br>and the counterbalancing field of<br>industrial relations or in modern<br>parlance employment relations<br>second<br>and at the risk of sounding<br>self-referential and it's all about me<br>it lies on my journey of learning and<br>discovery<br>my academic perambulations or<br>meanderings if you like and the people<br>that have surrounded me through that<br>process whanau colleagues students<br>external influences<br>so over the next<br>40 minutes brace yourselves<br>i will take us on a tour which reflects<br>some of my research and my concern with<br>how we view people at work<br>the embedded assumptions the questions<br>we do and don't ask<br>but first<br>some thanks and the beginning of my<br>journey<br>my formal education was in<br>organisational psychology originally a<br>discipline which concerns itself with<br>human behaviour at work<br>i came to an academic career late<br>after 15 years working in the public and<br>private sectors<br>in hrm and in consulting roles<br>i consider it a privilege to be an<br>academic<br>to explore and to influence through<br>research and teaching<br>and in turn to be challenged and<br>influenced by academic colleagues and<br>students by research participants and by<br>the practitioners i hope to inform in<br>some small way<br>i owe thanks to many many people along<br>the way<br>i can't possibly thank them all tonight<br>but not least<br>my three siblings and my late parents<br>billing jean bryson<br>all of them intelligent liberal-minded<br>caring supportive people<br>and as a baby of the family i benefited<br>from all five educating and challenging<br>my husband professor gordon anderson who<br>gives me not only his legal perspective<br>on employers and workers<br>but also his pragmatic reminder of the<br>difference between law and justice<br>particularly for workers<br>ironically for a legal academic<br>he has also taught me the power of a<br>short sentence in making your point<br>thank you gordon<br>for that and for so much more<br>to professor<br>or ng as he has always been known for<br>his second year social psychology<br>classes<br>and to cur inkson her six guest lectures<br>on organizational psychology in that<br>second year at otago in dare i say it<br>totally captivated me<br>and led me to complete my master's in<br>organisational psychology at the<br>university of canterbury<br>this was largely taught by the inspiring<br>bruce jameson<br>a lecturer who drew the best out of<br>students until he then chose to become<br>director of hr at the university of<br>canterbury<br>but ultimately<br>years later<br>great academic influence came from my<br>two phd supervisors<br>ng by that time a professor here at<br>victoria<br>and chris parkin in philosophy<br>also at victoria and laterally at otago<br>medical school<br>wellington chris i think might be in the<br>audience<br>i hope so yes<br>great<br>um chris you introduced me to the<br>vocabulary the thinking the questions<br>and reasoning of generations of moral<br>philosophers<br>in retrospect this really awakened me to<br>different disciplinary perspectives and<br>my phd alerted me not only to the<br>fascination of taking different<br>disciplinary perspectives on a topic<br>but also to the impact of different<br>framing by individuals within an<br>organization<br>in my phd i used psychology and moral<br>philosophy to explore the ethics of<br>managers and doctors in new zealand<br>public hospitals<br>a question i asked at the beginning of<br>interviews with doctors and with<br>managers<br>about their perception of their<br>respective roles revealed some important<br>differences in their perspectives<br>this was sort of a side finding to my<br>questions on ethics<br>managers<br>felt doctors enacted their roles as<br>doctors felt their roles were framed as<br>technically skilled employees<br>doctors saw managers roles as<br>organization focused gatekeepers<br>while managers saw their roles as<br>gatekeepers they also saw themselves as<br>facilitators of work and patient care<br>it's hard working in a humanitarian but<br>resource constrained organization such<br>as a hospital or health board<br>but the generally unvoiced differences<br>in mutual role perceptions or framing<br>and what they thought the roles should<br>be<br>led to misunderstanding and underpin a<br>some years later i came across this on<br>the ground difference and framing of<br>i interviewed him during the uh<br>building our productivity research<br>with colleagues professors of management<br>sally davenport and orstallenbach<br>marketing academic michelle renton and<br>communications expert professor shirley<br>leach thank you to all of you by the way<br>this very successful founder of a food<br>product business hence my picture<br>growing picking packing adding value to<br>product<br>told me when i asked to speak with the<br>organization's human resource manager<br>that he didn't have one<br>saying<br>if you get an hr manager then you get hr<br>this was a successful company it had low<br>staff turnover a seemingly good employer<br>deeply embedded in the local community<br>of course he did have issues with<br>workers<br>but he didn't frame them as hr issues<br>they were framed as business production<br>or community issues<br>for instance<br>employing workers seasonally<br>created a business headache with limited<br>labor supply in a provincial town<br>when the dole became a more attractive<br>prospect for predictable income<br>than erratic seasonal employment income<br>so the owner thought about the life<br>circumstances and needs of the potential<br>labour pool<br>after all<br>they were his next-door neighbours<br>he saw them at the pub<br>he then tailored the work terms and<br>conditions to meet their needs<br>specifically<br>in work that could not be done when it<br>was raining or all year round he had<br>provided continuity of income through a<br>weekly base level of pay regardless of<br>whether<br>this is what he told me<br>you have to understand jane what are<br>these people doing how do they survive<br>in the world<br>you've got to understand that these<br>people have got mortgages or rent to pay<br>on their house<br>high purchase payments on their<br>television or whatever<br>they have to make enough money to do<br>that<br>if because of the weather you haven't<br>got any work for a week what's that<br>person going to do<br>he had framed his workers as people with<br>lives and needs<br>he had framed the employment<br>relationship as one of mutual benefit<br>he implemented pay and other support<br>actions accordingly<br>this gave them a loyal workforce and<br>reduced the need to constantly recruit<br>and train up new staff<br>it also of course increased the social<br>legitimacy of the organization in the<br>local community<br>it was seen as a good employer<br>i revisited the website of that<br>organization last week just out of<br>interest i didn't want to present an<br>even now over a decade later it is clear<br>that the strong values base of the owner<br>still pervades the framing of the worker<br>management of people at work happens<br>through line managers and supervisors<br>but it is influenced by human resource<br>management policies and systems<br>and the hr advice and support from the<br>hrm group if there is one<br>in smaller businesses in the absence of<br>hr practitioners<br>often the beliefs and practices of the<br>employer<br>sometimes well-meaning and sometimes not<br>the way in which people are treated at<br>work is a product of how they are framed<br>or perceived by the organization or<br>employer<br>how they are treated by managers but<br>also by the employers hrm policies<br>processes employment systems and<br>strategy these encapsulate the beliefs<br>and values of the organization<br>in my research on developing human<br>capability<br>i've looked at influences on how we<br>frame people at work as happening at<br>three interconnected levels<br>institutional organizational and<br>individual<br>that institutional level is the<br>regulatory system and signals created by<br>government through the economic system<br>the education system employment<br>institutions standards and protections<br>for example<br>if there were no minimum wage and no<br>health and safety standards how would<br>that framework is<br>probably as somewhat expendable and of<br>no individual value<br>at the organisational level the formal<br>systems and processes of organizations<br>the business model the business strategy<br>workplace practices culture<br>all convey how workers are framed in<br>that organization<br>workers might be seen as liabilities to<br>be managed<br>cogs in a machine<br>or trusted partners in the organization<br>and at the individual level<br>the individual brings competence<br>confidence agency aspirations and<br>varying amounts how might a person frame<br>or value themselves and others in the<br>so human resource management operates<br>very much at the organisational level<br>we make societal and institutional level<br>choices about how we frame and value<br>workers and this shifts over time<br>often catalysed by a change of<br>government<br>the changing shape of the economy or<br>being pushed by lobby groups<br>hrm is an academic field and as the<br>label of a set of organizational<br>practices and a function<br>is itself a reflection of a set of<br>shifts institutionally in the 1980s and<br>1990s which i'll talk more about shortly<br>by and large the central function of hrm<br>is to assist the organisation to achieve<br>its goals through having an<br>appropriately skilled rewarded and<br>managed workforce performing as required<br>by management<br>the framing of people at work is<br>conveyed by the label human resource<br>management<br>like plant and raw materials humans are<br>another resource to be managed<br>and input to a production or service<br>process<br>in some cases the humans are perceived<br>as interchangeable and expendable and in<br>other cases<br>their skills knowledge and aptitudes are<br>rare and provide the employee and<br>human resource management emerged as a<br>us-inspired field of academic inquiry in<br>the 1980s<br>if i were being glib i would say it is<br>the love child of strategic management<br>and psychology<br>fueled by corporate america and peddled<br>globally by large consulting companies<br>i know because i used to work for one<br>this<br>blended this blend valued inquiry into<br>shaping worker behaviour to serve<br>organisational goals<br>within universities industrial relations<br>academics generally people from a<br>tradition of sociology political economy<br>and labor economics<br>had to reinvent themselves to at least<br>wear the veneer of hrm or ultimately<br>recast themselves in employment<br>relations<br>because in the 1990s many industrial<br>relations academic departments<br>disappeared in the uk and<br>english-speaking nations<br>a reflection of the swing towards more<br>neo-liberal economic policies a framing<br>of employment as an individual<br>relationship not a collective one<br>a view with no room for a counterbalance<br>and collective voice or trade union<br>representation that industrial relations<br>championed the difference between hrm<br>and ir industrial relations and their<br>framing of people at work is probably<br>best explained with reference to a<br>central paradigm in the ir and now<br>employment relations field the unitarist<br>versus pluralist frames of reference<br>model<br>initially developed by british<br>sociologist alan fox in the late 1960s<br>as colleagues at otago<br>allen gear et al observe<br>unitary and pluralist frames are more<br>than style choices<br>they cut to the heart of how employers<br>view<br>perceive and approach the management of<br>the employment relationship<br>theoretically at least industrial<br>relations and hrm have been portrayed as<br>representing pluralist and unitarist<br>ideology respectively<br>the pluralist perspective acknowledges<br>that there are differing interests<br>in workplace relationships<br>employees and employers may not agree<br>the likelihood of conflict and thus the<br>need for the state to cater for that to<br>be handled in a balanced manner<br>for all concerned<br>for example by having employment system<br>regulation employment institutions such<br>as trade unions tribunals and courts at<br>the institutional level<br>the unitary perspective rests on an<br>organisational logic of a unified<br>authority and loyalty structure which<br>legitimates managerial authority so<br>conflict is seen as unnecessary<br>and that manager and worker interests<br>are aligned<br>so workers should contribute to<br>organizational goals under management<br>direction<br>and managers deal directly with staff in<br>order to inspire loyalty and build a<br>but let us return to the change and<br>framing of people at work that heralded<br>i summarized the institutional and<br>organizational shift behind hrm in new<br>zealand in a chapter published about<br>five years ago<br>in this chapter i argued that over the<br>last 40 years two major drivers have<br>underpinned fundamental and ongoing<br>change in the administration of<br>workplace relationships in new zealand<br>first the neoliberal political economy<br>agenda which emerged in response to the<br>oil shocks and other crises in the 1970s<br>catalysed a range of consequential<br>changes<br>from economic deregulation labor market<br>and state sector reform all in the 80s<br>and 90s<br>to the commoditization of employment<br>organizations and individuals in the 90s<br>and 2000s<br>government policies changed the ideology<br>and approach to workplace relationships<br>in essence it reframed people at work<br>second the revolutionary growth in<br>information and communication<br>technologies<br>and their ever-expanding capabilities<br>has enabled the pervasiveness of these<br>changes<br>and this has been exacerbated over the<br>last three years of pandemic driven<br>change<br>in new zealand organizations these two<br>drivers established a shift from<br>administering industrial awards<br>to managing employer risk and<br>organisational image<br>a core element of that shift was the<br>reinvention of personnel management and<br>industrial relations as human resource<br>management and employment relations<br>notionally a move from a quasi pluralist<br>to a more unitary approach to workplace<br>relationships<br>in the 1970s<br>those of you that can remember them<br>the personnel department or staff<br>section administered pay and rations<br>according to national industrial awards<br>hopefully a fair day's pay for a fair<br>day's work<br>workers were a necessity to be<br>administered<br>trade union density was high in many<br>industries and thus industrial<br>negotiation was a feature of workplace<br>relations<br>in new zealand the widespread change<br>from that<br>industrial relations to<br>human resource management approach was<br>led by the change to workplace<br>management in the state sector as a<br>result of the state sector act 1988.<br>this coupled with the employment<br>contracts act 1991 paved the way indeed<br>encouraged a more unitary approach to<br>employment relationships<br>this change in institutional level<br>framing of people at work was rapidly<br>embedded in organizations<br>through restructurings new policies and<br>practices<br>all supported by management consultants<br>and their products and by us inspired hr<br>training and executive training i recall<br>this in the public sector in my first<br>job<br>i joined the public sector in 1984<br>and<br>overnight staff sections disappeared and<br>hr has had an important role to play in<br>managing risk for employers initially in<br>the phase of economic and labor market<br>deregulation of the 80s and 90s<br>hr was focused on managing the financial<br>risk of human capital costs<br>this entailed insuring staff were<br>employed on flexible arrangements<br>favorable to the employer<br>for instance with minimal or no<br>redundancy provisions<br>or on fixed term contracts or as<br>independent contractors or open-ended<br>contracts without overtime<br>this focus on flexibility to manage<br>costs has continued<br>and an added concern of managing legal<br>liability and potential damage to<br>organizational reputation has increased<br>over the nineties and 2000s<br>this is due in part to legislative<br>change and in part to improved mass<br>communication technologies<br>in the decade to 2016<br>labor flexibility grew with both<br>temporal and geographical flexibility<br>enabled by technology<br>the ability to work from home<br>or any other location proved extremely<br>useful in times of natural disaster for<br>example after the christchurch<br>earthquake<br>and kaikoura earthquakes<br>mobile technologies revolutionized some<br>jobs not only working at distance but<br>also instant ordering of products access<br>to important information and rapid<br>communication of information<br>and of course<br>now in 2022 that geographical<br>flexibility is commonplace<br>driven by pandemic<br>however it has also provided risks and<br>challenges for hrm<br>how to ensure the extension of<br>management control to those in different<br>locations<br>potential issues of health and safety of<br>employees whom it's now possible to<br>communicate with about work at any time<br>of the day or night<br>this runs the risk of allowing no<br>downtime particularly for those in<br>management or specialist roles<br>or problems of isolation and alienation<br>it also provides another medium through<br>which miscommunication and conflict can<br>occur<br>now the world is a different place and<br>so is new zealand<br>before the pandemic work was already<br>being transformed by information and<br>communication technology<br>indeed it changes the type of work we do<br>and how we do it it changes how we<br>relate to others and it blurs work and<br>private life space time and information<br>it is now not enough to just do your job<br>nowadays the hr department on behalf of<br>the ceo wants you to be a totally<br>engaged employee<br>loyal to the organization and all your<br>work and private life dealings<br>committed to exert discretionary effort<br>for the organisation<br>willing to fulfill the sustainability or<br>corporate social responsibility agenda<br>of the organisation so as to boost its<br>employer brand and social legitimacy<br>the hr department administer the terms<br>and conditions of your employment<br>agreement which were given to you as<br>part of your individual<br>employment agreement<br>trade union density is low except in the<br>the modern hr department is primarily<br>concerned with managing risk for the<br>employer<br>workplace relationships are a liability<br>to be managed<br>as a result the emphasis is on hr policy<br>and compliance<br>on employer reputation<br>organisational image and the workers<br>but sphero sphere a thought for hr<br>the hrm role is riddled with tensions<br>policy and compliance or transactional<br>hr<br>versus a capability and organisation<br>development role<br>and between business interests and work<br>and well-being<br>one way or another organizations have<br>always framed workers somewhat<br>instrumentally as a means to an end<br>the difference moving into the future is<br>the predictable and unpredictable impact<br>of information and communication<br>technology<br>on how we manage and relate to each<br>other<br>is this the beginning of another<br>reframing of people at work<br>the most likely scenario is that<br>workplace relationships and their<br>management will continue along the now<br>well-established path of hr implementing<br>the unitary model focused on<br>individualization of the employment<br>relationship<br>various forms of labor flexibility to<br>meet the needs of the business<br>hr policy and advice to management and<br>practices to ensure worker compliance<br>and commitment<br>the concern for employer brand and<br>organisational image will remain vital<br>and integral to that will be a<br>continuation of the move away from the<br>term human resources<br>to become<br>not the hr director but chief people<br>officers<br>director of people and capability or<br>director of people and culture to name a<br>few<br>whatever the title the task is to serve<br>the goals of the organisation<br>in the immediate future the recent focus<br>on well-being at work will continue<br>this well-being trend had its genesis<br>partly at a much broader level in united<br>nations concerns with social well-being<br>of the populace and attempts by various<br>governments to incorporate measures of<br>social well-being in national statistics<br>it is also one way in which hr responded<br>to the new zealand government's renewed<br>interest in workplace health and safety<br>but well-being is not health and safety<br>however<br>it could be that translated to the<br>workplace it offers hope for a more<br>pluralistic focus on the interests of<br>workers rather than solely those of<br>employer and shareholders<br>but as coken notes<br>a u.s academic<br>to meet contemporary and future<br>workplace challenges<br>hr professionals will need to define<br>redefine their role and professional<br>identity to advocate and support a<br>better balance between employer and<br>employee interests at work<br>it seems from research that<br>i have done that the vast majority of<br>organizations only respond to actions<br>which are perceived as either good for<br>business or an unavoidable legal<br>requirement<br>of organizations having a wider<br>responsibility to society with a few<br>notable exceptions are few and far<br>between<br>it is hardly surprising<br>in this context that notions of hr<br>adopting a wider framework encompassing<br>responsibility for the social contract<br>so<br>what are other ways of framing people at<br>work<br>a large amount of my research has<br>focused on exploring the development of<br>human capability<br>over several years i used the capability<br>approach of development economist<br>amateur sen<br>to frame a more expansive view of people<br>in this context capability was not just<br>about skills or achieving organizational<br>goals<br>but about the opportunities<br>freedoms and agency afforded to people<br>at work to live lives they have reason<br>to value<br>that is to be capable humans<br>not just skill sets for the workplace<br>however not only at an organisational<br>level but also at an institutional level<br>our systems are not currently structured<br>to frame people at work in this way my<br>research explored what expectations<br>workers had of their work environment<br>the opportunities or freedoms they<br>required<br>this is a very brief summary and i won't<br>go into detail about it but there's a<br>lot more that lies behind it<br>but for workers the opportunities or<br>freedoms they wanted through the<br>workplace fell into five broad areas<br>as you can see security and safety<br>a number of things related to skill<br>not only developing it but also the<br>opportunity to use it<br>relationships in the workplace<br>respect<br>recognition in the form of pay<br>and<br>thanks for what is done and autonomy<br>which also included<br>the right to<br>join um collective groups such as trade<br>unions<br>to achieve work-life balance to have<br>some control over decision making and<br>how they approach their work<br>and on the other hand employers reported<br>they wanted competence<br>engagement and compliance with some<br>employers compliance just boiled down to<br>wanting people to turn up to work on<br>time<br>so there is some alignment between skill<br>and competence<br>but there's also some tension<br>and there's some tension between the<br>desire for um<br>engagement versus the desire for safety<br>and autonomy uh the desire for<br>compliance versus the desire for<br>autonomy<br>in one piece of work i explored the<br>skill side of the equation and in<br>particular human resource development or<br>i explored two important but seldom<br>is it reasonable to expect employers to<br>contribute to human resource development<br>and what is it reasonable to expect<br>research suggests that despite a<br>changing human resource development<br>vocabulary for example from training and<br>development to learning and development<br>and an emphasis on lifelong learning<br>the practice of human resource<br>development is almost exclusively<br>concerned with the achievement of<br>organizational ends and not about<br>contributing to society or the wider<br>workforce or the individual<br>this concern is underpinned by the<br>pervasive assumption assumptions<br>of resource-based views of the firm<br>and human capital theory which assert<br>despite heavy criticism<br>that it is not reasonable to expect<br>employers to act in the development<br>interests of employees who may then<br>leave the organisation or may not use<br>all their skills for the benefit of the<br>organisation<br>these theoretical frames have become<br>unquestioned normative drivers<br>of<br>hrd<br>i've seen that when i've been<br>interviewing employers<br>who won't even take on apprentices would<br>rather poach them once another employer<br>has<br>invested in the apprenticeship training<br>i would argue that it is time to<br>reorient hrd to human capability<br>the core tensions between the economic<br>and the social and between<br>organisational ends and individual needs<br>with which hrm must grapple are<br>epitomised in human resource development<br>two requirements must be met to reframe<br>practice<br>the first is that human resource<br>development practitioners need to<br>clarify their ethical underpinning by<br>determining the answer to such questions<br>as what are the action guiding<br>principles that they adhere to<br>whose interests do they practice and<br>what is the purpose and scope of their<br>practice<br>the second requirement<br>is that hrd practitioners need to<br>explore a broader range of conceptions<br>of human resource development practice<br>and theoretical frameworks<br>rather than the organizationally bound<br>and largely short-term focused paradigms<br>which have dominated thinking to date<br>cens capability approach to human<br>development provides one framework<br>within which to reorient hrd to the<br>notion of developing human capability<br>and permits the canvassing of a broader<br>range of concerns in searching for the<br>identity and ethical principles of human<br>resource development practice<br>hid practitioners could facilitate<br>employers to reframe entrenched notions<br>of training and development to create<br>organizations as capability enhancing<br>institutions<br>but achieving this may be problematical<br>i recently conducted research examining<br>training called clauses in collective<br>employment agreements<br>and interviewing a range of union<br>officials representing a wide variety of<br>industries and occupations<br>training clauses and collective<br>agreements tend to be narrow in scope<br>and the better clauses are for those<br>occupations in which there are ongoing<br>competency development requirements<br>of the occupational body<br>in some organizations and in some<br>sectors<br>there is a well-embedded culture of<br>training but not in all<br>given access to training is so variable<br>in new zealand with low-skilled<br>occupations less likely to access<br>employer-funded training<br>and education<br>the training situation is unlikely to<br>change without<br>further pressure of government policy<br>initiatives<br>framing people at work as deserving of<br>skill development will entail<br>initiatives across the levels of<br>community economic and business<br>development in order to develop a<br>culture of accommodating both individual<br>and organisational values<br>maybe roth will do it<br>such a culture only becomes dominant<br>once it has been embedded in<br>organisational practice<br>at every level<br>from shareholder and management<br>commitment<br>to organisational philosophy and<br>strategy<br>human resource management policies<br>and supporting organizational structures<br>management and team practices individual<br>behaviors<br>the practice of hrm is in a difficult<br>space<br>often lacking real power within<br>organisational management but also<br>mistrusted by employees<br>canadian academic fenwick observed that<br>hrm does not have much power within<br>organizational hierarchy and that<br>practitioners may end up completely<br>marginalised if they challenge core<br>ideologies and practices<br>hrm has long been caught between a<br>desire to serve individuals and serving<br>organisational dominance<br>hrm practitioners generally need to<br>decide whether they are merely doing a<br>job as agents of management in the<br>organisation<br>or whether they are exercising a broader<br>perspective and social conscience in<br>free and frank advice to the<br>organization<br>do hrd practitioners think long term and<br>strategically about human development<br>and balancedness with short-term drivers<br>if hrd and hrm practitioners do not do<br>this as part of their role for<br>organizations<br>so we're nearly there<br>i want to conclude my academic<br>corramulation by discussing a piece of<br>work exploring different disciplinary<br>perspectives on skill<br>this built on discussions i had with<br>colleagues at oxford university<br>the centre for skills knowledge and<br>organisation performance<br>economist professor ken mayhew<br>education training and skills professor<br>ewit keep<br>and vocational education professor susan<br>james really and a big thank you to them<br>for their collegiality over a long<br>number of years<br>in any setting one's disciplinary<br>training or perspective<br>guides the type of questions you ask the<br>methodologies you choose the assumptions<br>you do and don't make<br>it creates your blind spots<br>i'm a firm advocate of approaching an<br>issue or phenomenon from a number of<br>different perspectives or angles<br>as this can expand<br>and challenge the way we frame things<br>so a multi-disciplinary or<br>in this chapter<br>showing on the slide<br>i focused on skill not only because i<br>was asked to<br>but also because it is a ubiquitous term<br>but it's not always commonly understood<br>our understanding of skill varies often<br>as a reflection of our disciplinary<br>interests<br>in the chapter i used three<br>cross-disciplinary lenses to examine<br>varying views of skill<br>it's meaning it's acquisition<br>its utilization its recognition and its<br>impact<br>these lenses<br>political economy of skill<br>skill as an organizational resource<br>and learning theory<br>enabled an exploration of economic<br>political science sociology industrial<br>relations human resource management<br>organisation studies education and<br>psychology perspectives<br>i found that in this range of<br>disciplinary perspectives there were<br>many overlaps but also there were four<br>key areas of difference that emerged<br>there were differences in level of focus<br>on skill<br>some disciplines focused at national<br>level some at organisational somewhat<br>individual some focused on policy some<br>on the personal<br>there were differences in where<br>disciplines regarded the location of<br>school<br>some saw it being in the person<br>some saw it being in the job<br>and some saw it as a social construction<br>there were differences in skill<br>definitions<br>technical or behavioral or cognitive<br>and finally there were differences<br>in the type of variable that skill was<br>was seen as<br>dependent independent mediator or<br>outcome<br>as a result each disciplinary<br>perspective reveals and explores only<br>part of the full picture of skill<br>the best way to demonstrate the impact<br>of different disciplinary perspectives<br>the scenario i'll examine is unpaid<br>graduate internships something close to<br>the heart of universities<br>one of the challenges facing government<br>skills policy is that transition from<br>education to employment<br>in the case of tertiary education in the<br>united kingdom in the 2010s<br>when employers cut graduate positions<br>one consequence was an increase in<br>university graduates taking on unpaid<br>internships in order to develop relevant<br>in the worst cases graduates occupied a<br>series of unpaid internships in the hope<br>of ultimately securing a paid job<br>different disciplines would apply their<br>own methodologies to address their own<br>perspectives in analyzing this<br>so a political economy perspective on<br>a political economy of skilled<br>perspective on unpaid internships<br>mike seek to explore the short and long<br>term impact of these employer<br>initiatives on firms<br>on the labour market generally and on<br>graduates<br>and the relationship or compatibility of<br>these actions with a range of government<br>policy<br>from an economic perspective analysis<br>might address whether internships<br>facilitate entry to the labour market<br>and ask whether the costs benefits of<br>internships are born appropriately<br>and what are the knock-on effects to<br>other positions and to the graduate<br>labour market<br>a political science analysis may<br>question how unpaid internships relate<br>to existing skilled formation policies<br>and other government policies relating<br>for example to welfare<br>the sociological analysis may examine<br>how internships construct skill and<br>whether they perpetuate certain social<br>structures that disadvantage some groups<br>while privileging others<br>an industrial relations analysis would<br>focus on issues of fair treatment of the<br>intern<br>and institutional or regulatory<br>mechanisms to ensure<br>fairness<br>and the legal one on the employment<br>status of the intern and on how are they<br>protected in the workplace and in the<br>work relationship<br>from an hr perspective analysis would<br>focus on the costs and benefits to the<br>organization of internships<br>how does the intern contribute to<br>organizational goals<br>how does one structure in turn tasks and<br>learning to optimize productivity<br>what does this do to the employer brand<br>what does this do to the retention<br>development and contribution of other<br>employees<br>how does this fit the talent management<br>strategy of the organization<br>how does the organization minimise legal<br>and other risks associated with unpaid<br>internships<br>from an education and psychology<br>perspective<br>analysis might centre on what skill is<br>developed in the internship<br>how is the learning structured and<br>supported<br>how are graduates existing skills<br>so<br>what can one conclude<br>about the implications of taking<br>different disciplinary perspectives on<br>skill<br>it's obvious from this example that to<br>analyze from only one of these<br>perspectives results in a limited view<br>of the issue<br>the<br>consequence of this for policy<br>formulations is worrying as a narrow<br>perspective on skill<br>will result in policy<br>that is at best ineffective or at worst<br>harmful<br>in the case of unpaid internships the<br>temptation may be under pressure from<br>employers to take only the hrm<br>perspective<br>this then takes no account of<br>compatibility with other skills related<br>government policies or of the immediate<br>and longer term impacts on students or<br>other workers<br>nor any concern for the labour market as<br>a whole<br>alternatively even when taking a broader<br>political economy perspective<br>the resulting policy may lack an<br>appreciation of how internships are<br>implemented in organizations<br>and how skill development can be<br>enhanced or inhibited by internship<br>arrangements<br>the full picture requires an<br>appreciation of multiple disciplinary<br>perspectives<br>examining skill from multiple<br>perspectives is a challenging but<br>important task in order to increase our<br>understanding develop effective policy<br>and positively influence individual and<br>societal well-being<br>which brings me back to the university<br>i have been lucky to have been involved<br>in supervision teams across a wide<br>variety of disciplines<br>so i want to give a big thank you to the<br>inspiring phd and master students and<br>co-supervisors i have had the privilege<br>of working with many of whom i can see<br>here<br>a big thanks also to all my colleagues<br>in the wellington school of business and<br>government<br>and especially in the human resource<br>management and employment relations<br>group and the center for labour<br>employment and work<br>and also<br>to colleagues across the university<br>it's wonderful to have the freedom and<br>the opportunity to work with people from<br>so many disciplines and backgrounds<br>i have had classicists present on<br>institutions in the ancient world<br>to my institution and organizations<br>class<br>i've done hrm stuff for architecture<br>it's it's a wonderful opportunity that<br>the university is the home of<br>scholarship and learning<br>individually our disciplines are<br>interesting and impactful<br>how we frame things the methods we use<br>the assumptions made the questions we do<br>and don't ask are important<br>collectively different disciplinary<br>perspectives can yield powerful<br>relevant insights<br>so<br>i will finish by noting that there has<br>recently been consultation led by envy<br>the ministry of business innovation and<br>employment<br>on a legislative response to modern<br>slavery and worker exploitation<br>i started with slavery and i will finish<br>with it<br>globally the fastest growing crime is<br>not drugs and weapons dealing or cyber<br>fraud it is modern slavery<br>slavery frames people predominantly<br>children young women and young men as<br>commodities to be traded or used till<br>broken<br>things with no rights freedoms or<br>opportunities<br>it is not just the preserve of poorer<br>nations<br>it happens in developed nations like our<br>own<br>it features across industries and<br>throughout supply chains<br>how we frame people at work is important<br>and will always remain so<br>institutionally organizationally and<br>individually<br>at the university<br>how we respond to the challenges of our<br>time<br>through the collective power of our many<br>disciplinary perspectives is our freedom<br>and our responsibility<br>tenacotto tenecotto tenecotto<br>for those who do not know me my name is<br>mark hickford<br>and i am the pro vice chancellor of<br>government law and business here at<br>teherangawaka victoria university<br>wellington<br>it is my distinct privilege to appear<br>before you now to propose a vote of<br>thanks<br>for our colleague ahorangi jane bryson<br>on this evening we celebrate jane<br>and give thanks<br>for a marvelous inaugural lecture<br>my greetings also to gordon anderson<br>jane's partner in life<br>and to all family and friends present<br>here this evening<br>i had thought i<br>should also note that<br>colleagues such as richard hill and<br>others<br>were meant to be in attendance here<br>tonight so if you're present my<br>greetings to you also<br>it is wonderful to see everyone here<br>tonight<br>this evening<br>in an inaugural entitled framing people<br>at work<br>autonomous skilled individual<br>or compliant cog in a machine or perhaps<br>compliant clog<br>we have been honored to hear jane bryson<br>traverse central themes<br>in her illustrious<br>career as an academic<br>professor jane bryson offers an approach<br>to conceptions of work and the manifold<br>futures of work<br>to skill<br>and to organizational change<br>that is captivatingly and deliberately<br>open<br>to diverse disciplinary approaches<br>this to me typifies her scholarly<br>interventions<br>throughout<br>an accomplished and illustrious career<br>as we have discerned this evening<br>jane bryson exhorts a multi-disciplinary<br>approach stance<br>with<br>several perspectives and methodologies<br>being deployed<br>whether one is considering differing<br>notions of what it is to have skills<br>and skillfulness and domains of work<br>or whether one is looking at shifting<br>systemic approaches across time<br>from pluralistically orientated<br>industrial relations<br>to rather more unitarist human resources<br>management in workplace administration<br>to use her words in an earlier published<br>chapter from 2017<br>new zealand she has contended witness to<br>shift<br>during the 1980s and into the subsequent<br>decade from administering industrial<br>awards<br>to managing employer risk and<br>organizational image<br>you heard utter those words in this very<br>lecture this evening<br>jane bryson also said in that chapter<br>the unitary perspective rests on an<br>organizational logic of a unified<br>authority and loyalty structure which<br>legitimates managerial authority<br>conflict is seen as unnecessary and all<br>workers should contribute to<br>organisational goals under management<br>direction<br>managers deal directly with staff<br>in order to inspire loyalty and build a<br>unified culture<br>in charting these letter shifts for<br>instance jane bryson has explored the<br>ways in which a unitarist orientation in<br>human resource management tends to be<br>transactional and much more<br>individualized with transgressions or<br>conflicts<br>seen as reducible to particular<br>individual pathologies she makes us<br>reflect on neglected or perhaps<br>otherwise forgotten aspects of that not<br>too distant past<br>and endeavors to ensure that we continue<br>to contemplate other possibilities<br>around framing the notion of work and<br>relations in the workplace and to each<br>other<br>having had the personal pleasure of<br>looking across her preceding work as i<br>prepared to listen to her lecture this<br>evening i've noted this very openness to<br>diverse disciplinary methods is an<br>enduring feature of her own research<br>thus we heard her note in her lecture<br>this evening how the formal systems and<br>processes<br>the business model strategy the<br>workplace practices the culture all<br>convey how workers are framed in that<br>organization<br>as she set out back in 2008 when she<br>approaches conceptions of culture<br>she exhorts those in the discipline of<br>human resources and management to view<br>cases more dynamically<br>to appreciate that there are multiple<br>views in and of organizations<br>and she urges an earnest attempt to<br>pursue complexities<br>in her own uber her own portfolio of<br>research she has said and i quote in the<br>absence of full-scale participant<br>observer studies which entail their own<br>research shortcomings we as<br>organizational researchers remain the<br>interpreters and purveyors of<br>organizational snapshots<br>she gives rise the ambition<br>to continuously improve upon<br>understanding and what is before us in<br>contemplation<br>secondly and relatedly a commitment to<br>enabling flourishing human capabilities<br>courses through her scholarship<br>in using conceptions of human capability<br>as developed by mata sen<br>and martha nussbaum amongst others she<br>draws on specialists in philosophy and<br>econom economics and other disciplines<br>to apply different angles of vision<br>captivatingly she talks about<br>an aspiring shift perhaps<br>from hrm human resource management<br>to hcd human capability development<br>it is a delight to be here and to have<br>heard from such an accomplished scholar<br>with such depth imagination<br>and humanity in her approach<br>i cannot however depart the podium<br>without paying special acknowledgement<br>to jane as a leader and a colleague<br>i am privileged to work with her in her<br>capacity as dean of wellington school of<br>business and government<br>i was personally delighted to be a<br>colleague of hers when she became the<br>deputy dean some years ago<br>i've had the pleasure of working with<br>her when she was associate dean research<br>and also i find her humane<br>undoubtedly calm<br>and able always to engage<br>with colleagues as human beings<br>jane this university your university is<br>so grateful gladdened and heartened to<br>have you counted amongst its<br>professoriate<br>and it has been a joy for me to offer<br>this vote of thanks<br>before i invite colleagues here to join<br>us for refreshments on the mezzanine<br>floor of this building<br>i ask that all of those present here<br>this evening join with me in showing the<br>customary</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
