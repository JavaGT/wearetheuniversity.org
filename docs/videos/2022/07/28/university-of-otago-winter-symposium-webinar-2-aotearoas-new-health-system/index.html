behold maori at the<br>university of otago<br>and it's my pleasure to act in the role<br>of nc<br>for our symposium this evening<br>before i introduce our panelists<br>i want to make just a couple of<br>introductory comments<br>in 2018<br>the honourable dr david clarke<br>minister of health at the time<br>with a focus on fairness or equity and<br>sustainability<br>i was a member of that review panel<br>the panel delivered its final<br>recommendations<br>in<br>march april 2020 just at the time<br>that new zealand was entering its first<br>lockdown<br>fast forward<br>the minister of health now is the<br>honorable andrew little<br>and he has initiated<br>the most significant<br>and far-reaching set of health reforms<br>that we have seen<br>since those of the<br>uh then labor government more than 20<br>years ago<br>tonight our panelists<br>will be discussing these health reforms<br>their strengths their weaknesses<br>and the risks<br>the format for the symposium this<br>evening will be that each panelist<br>will speak for about five to seven<br>minutes<br>to introduce their main thoughts and<br>ideas on the health reforms and<br>following that<br>we will open the floor to your questions<br>so i ask all of you to be thinking about<br>your questions and send them to us via<br>the chat function and zoom<br>now it's my pleasure to introduce our<br>panelists<br>speaking first will be<br>tim stokes<br>tim is a professor of general practice<br>and is head of department of the<br>department of general practice and rural<br>health at the university of otago<br>tim is an expert in amongst other things<br>general practice and health systems<br>second up will be robin gould<br>robin<br>is a professor of health policy and is<br>dean and the pro vice chancellor of<br>otago business school and the division<br>of commerce<br>robin is amongst other things a health<br>third will be joe baxter on my left<br>joe is a professor of haura maori and is<br>dean of the dunedin school of medicine<br>joe's expertise includes amongst many<br>other things health policy<br>maori health and the health workforce<br>all three of our panelists this evening<br>have researched and written extensively<br>on the subject of the new zealand health<br>system all three have worked over a long<br>period of time with government and other<br>agencies and all three have a breadth of<br>professional expertise that i have not<br>done justice to in my very brief<br>introductions<br>welcome to all three of you and thank<br>you for being here<br>let's kick off then with tim stokes<br>who's sitting opposite me<br>who is going to lead us<br>into the complex arena<br>of the health reforms<br>over to u10<br>so as peter says i wear two hats i am a<br>university academic and conduct teaching<br>research and service in the university<br>i also have been a general practitioner<br>both in the uk and in new zealand for<br>around about 30 years<br>and i need to confuse those two things<br>to talk about what i'm going to say<br>tonight so i'm going to start off by<br>saying<br>for me what the health reforms are<br>fundamentally about about hitargata it's<br>anger it's hungary they're about the<br>people<br>for me they're about the patients that i<br>see in my clinic i want them to receive<br>high quality accessible care i want to<br>be seen promptly when they're ill my<br>secondary care and i want to work with<br>secondary care to better manage their<br>chronic conditions<br>at the population level that approach<br>will lead to more equitable out health<br>outcomes for all new zealanders<br>but it isn't just about patients and<br>consumers that that's important it's<br>actually about the workforce<br>we can't actually have a high<br>principling health system without having<br>a high functioning workforce<br>and for me there's only two words that<br>make up three words actually that make a<br>high functioning workforce that is that<br>staff should have high intrinsic<br>motivation<br>it should be a joy and a privilege to<br>work in the health system people should<br>and people should feel that feel that<br>they can care for their patients that<br>they can get their patients in the<br>timely way and they can get better<br>and one of the challenges we have at the<br>moment given us just the health system<br>is that we've moved from intrinsic<br>motivation to moral distress<br>and many of my colleagues in the system<br>have moral distress because we cannot<br>get the time inexplicable we need for<br>our patients and that needs fixing<br>but let me now come back to talking<br>about what i want to say tonight i want<br>to give you an overview first of all<br>about news and health system bearing in<br>mind that there will be a range of<br>people in the audience<br>so you can't talk about the health<br>system without talking about 1938<br>when healthcare was accessed was made of<br>right and it was universal and where he<br>also had a mixed model of delivery of<br>public systems in the hospitals and<br>private care and the community community<br>at that time would like to job a<br>practitioner can<br>the last major health system reform was<br>in 2000<br>that actually established district<br>health boards which have now been<br>disestablished<br>however importantly the reforms in 2000<br>had a very strong vision of the<br>importance of primary health care in<br>general health system as amplified by<br>over the past 20 years the new health<br>system has<br>achieved has achieved a lot<br>as a health system we can fare favorably<br>with other high income countries in<br>terms of our outcomes<br>and we've actually achieved this by<br>spending less of the proportion of gdp<br>than our comparative nations<br>we've also done work that has been<br>valued not only nationally but<br>internationally in turning health system<br>reform<br>just to give you one example from 2000<br>to 2017 the canterbury health system<br>transformed itself<br>it restructured itself with a focus on<br>keeping people well and healthy in their<br>homes and communities<br>and it did that really by three<br>principles<br>despite budget problems in the system<br>they developed a clear unified vision of<br>one health system one budget<br>they put sustained investment and valued<br>their health workforce supporting the<br>development of high-intensity motivation<br>and promoting innovation<br>and they also develop new models of<br>integrated work in something called<br>allowancing<br>moving on nasa health system reforms<br>the 2018 health and disability system<br>review<br>found<br>broadly the following issues the first<br>is that the current health system is<br>overly complicated and very fragmented<br>from a patient and consumer perspective<br>that is true<br>in fact it's so complex that in fact as<br>a general practitioner having worked in<br>new zealand i find the system complex<br>and competing to navigate for my<br>patients<br>the second thing is that maori as<br>totality partners have not been well<br>served by the health system to date<br>and the third thing i want to identify<br>is that we have not made best use of a<br>talent to people in our system<br>and that has been structural to the fact<br>that we are not collaborating well in<br>organic we're gonna we are not<br>necessarily collaborating well<br>individually we're certainly not<br>collaborating on individuals and there's<br>been a lot of resistance to change and a<br>lot of patch protection in the system<br>the health disability system we've<br>really made a series of detailed<br>recommendations and broadly speaking<br>they are in line with the health reforms<br>the health reforms themselves came into<br>law from the first of july 2020 the<br>pioneer futures bill was passed and gave<br>royal ascent<br>and there are three structural important<br>structural changes i would identify nd<br>health reforms<br>the first of which is the establishment<br>and i know of nobody who works in the<br>health system who doesn't see that to<br>say an important transformative step<br>we now will have an independent entity<br>it will work with health new zealand to<br>commission and plan services omari<br>the system for mari okay<br>and we also have a clear statement<br>around how we engage with maori in the<br>health system do we marry partnership<br>boards<br>and i think that's a fundamental<br>change it's transformative and it's<br>positive<br>the second thing that in the reform was<br>the establishment of health new zealand<br>technology that's been broadly welcomed<br>and there have been some concerns about<br>this about abolishing all the dhbs and<br>those some concerns about possible<br>centralization<br>it essentially replaces the twenty<br>district health boards into four<br>regional divisions in which deadly one<br>in south island<br>and that will do two importantly<br>separate things one of which it will<br>commission<br>primary and community services<br>and it will manage the delivery of<br>health services in particular hospital<br>services<br>and each region will establish district<br>offices that are located close to the<br>community<br>and at the moment those districts are<br>very much coterminous with the existing<br>the third thing is that there is a new<br>public health agency set up in the app<br>and that's going to be business due to<br>the ministry of health<br>that's extremely important<br>the lack of a strong public health<br>function over the last 10 20 years has<br>led to a number of important<br>unfortunately led to a number of<br>important public health mishaps not<br>least to have a lot north a couple back<br>so those are the three main structural<br>changes in addition to that<br>there's very clear statement in the bill<br>about a more accountable health service<br>or system i should say<br>the buzz phrase is nationally<br>coordinated locally driven<br>so as a result of that the idea is that<br>primary community care will be organized<br>into the counties that cover all of new<br>zealand<br>and the eastern country will have a<br>locality plan setting out how those<br>the last thing i want to do is give you<br>a a sort of high level take on the<br>reforms that hopefully then lead into<br>the discussion and the other speakers<br>so from my perspective being someone who<br>is particularly interested in the role<br>and importance of primary health care in<br>the health system<br>i'm concerned that there's actually no<br>statements in the act about primary<br>health care its importance<br>and there's also no formal structure in<br>the new health system such as the<br>primary health care agency or any<br>specific ministry of health directorate<br>there's also no separate new primary<br>health care strategy either<br>and i think those things to me do give<br>me a worry that health new zealand may<br>actually end up being hospitals in new<br>zealand<br>or at least that the language that will<br>be used to talk about primary health<br>care will be hospital-centric<br>such as the function of the health<br>system is to transfer more care from<br>hospitals to secondary care<br>and i think we do need to focus on what<br>i would describe as the iceberg of<br>health care provision that means that we<br>most talk about a tip of the iceberg<br>which is hospital sector but we need to<br>start to understand that most care is<br>delivered in the community and we need<br>to start talking about what we need to<br>do to support and grow that care in the<br>community<br>the second and the final last thing i<br>want to mention around implementation<br>challenges<br>i do believe that if we're going to<br>transform the health system it doesn't<br>need more resourcing<br>we don't spend enough on health<br>while the<br>2023 budget does increase the budget<br>that's like that is primarily being used<br>to clear pre-existing district help or<br>deficits<br>correcting historical and investment in<br>hospital services that's important<br>but we are not currently correcting the<br>historical underfunding and the<br>investment in primary healthcare and<br>community care<br>the second thing is we cannot as i<br>mentioned at the beginning<br>implement health<br>system changes without a high pensioning<br>workforce and at the moment we have a<br>problem we have a problem in terms of<br>recruitment and we have a problem in<br>terms of retention<br>and<br>that needs to be addressed and i suppose<br>the final implementation is inevitably<br>this has been positioned as a<br>transformative step for the health<br>system and i think in many ways it is<br>but it nonetheless it is being framed as<br>a big bang restructure of the system<br>one thing that the simpson report that<br>self-disciplinary made very clear but<br>the health system is a complex adaptive<br>system<br>and in such systems multiple small<br>incremental changes to that context<br>specific will deliver<br>and we must remember as i gave you the<br>example of canterbury that took at least<br>10 years to affect the necessary<br>cultural change to working in<br>partnership with other people the system<br>to affect change so it will take time<br>and people need to understand that<br>so to close often what you hear about<br>peltiers at the moment is the devil's in<br>the detail<br>well i think that's actually quite an<br>opposite phrase because actually my take<br>on the health reforms is that they are a<br>road paid with good intentions<br>and<br>this road could and i hope leaders to<br>new jerusalem to be transformative<br>enable that equity<br>but it could take us down<br>down the road to a darker place<br>where the reforms essentially become<br>structural redisorganization<br>and where one where we then allow the<br>current pressure on new zealand health<br>system not to be fixed<br>so that has led us into the discussion<br>the reforms in place by the iota<br>legislation are ambitious in nature<br>they present the most fundamental shift<br>in the administration and planning<br>arrangements for our health system in<br>over two decades as tim has already<br>pointed out<br>the reforms make a number of promises<br>and in my view hold considerable hope<br>for building a better health system<br>but let us not forget that a change of<br>the magnitude being set out will take as<br>tim's already pointed out several years<br>to bed in<br>and for those front line workers and for<br>patients<br>quite a long time for them to see<br>differences<br>so in my opening comments i'd really<br>like to just touch on three<br>points<br>why i support the reforms<br>why the reforms will struggle to deliver<br>and in response to this why we need to<br>shift how we fund health<br>so first why i support the reforms in<br>principle<br>so the former dhbs were always in my<br>view going to be troubled and that is<br>that they were set up with limited<br>ability to work collaboratively across<br>the sector uh as they were created as<br>localized victims<br>uh areas such as information technology<br>require a national approach and<br>overarching architecture along with many<br>others such as workforce planning for<br>example<br>a national planning and delivery<br>mechanism is needed for effective<br>resource allocation to create learning<br>systems and to unlock<br>and coordinate systems resources patient<br>access and so forth<br>if we uh go back over<br>the history of health reforms in this<br>country and particularly looking at the<br>period of what i have called the period<br>of revolving doors where we had a<br>succession of health reforms put in<br>place by a succession of governments<br>from the late 1980s up until when the<br>dhbs were put in place<br>in my view<br>and there is some good evidence for this<br>the what was known as the health funding<br>authority period uh was the best model<br>and the health funding authority for<br>those with<br>recent memory<br>from that period was a single national<br>agency<br>which worked to create national<br>processes and was focused on consistency<br>of service delivery<br>so in that context<br>health nz and the maori health authority<br>provide a very good opportunity<br>particularly the maori health authority<br>with<br>the capacity to ask some really tough<br>questions around how the system works<br>for maori<br>and therefore all<br>on to the second point uh the reforms um<br>uh will struggle as thomas already<br>pointed out to deliver without a<br>fundamental rethink of how we fund<br>health in new zealand<br>so key reform goals are service<br>integration coordination and equity<br>and yet funding continues<br>to be separated into the primary care<br>and general practice sector<br>with another line of funding going into<br>the public hospital sector<br>we also have the public and private<br>health care sectors continuing to<br>operate in parallel<br>but the private sector of course<br>benefits significantly from public<br>sector backup and support and as tim has<br>already pointed out these are<br>arrangements that have their origins and<br>uh the 1938 social security act and the<br>historic compromises uh made after that<br>and so the goals of coordination and of<br>equity with the current reforms are<br>inherently undermined by those<br>underlying institutional arrangements<br>and so lastly<br>in my view we need a serious debate<br>about social insurance or health<br>noting of course that there is no<br>perfect<br>funding model for health globally<br>so social insurance works<br>very similarly to acc<br>in that it is funded through a mix of<br>payroll and employer contributions along<br>with contributions from government to<br>ensure that the goals for social<br>insurance that are set up in the context<br>of the country where social insurance is<br>the mechanism are met<br>very very importantly social social<br>insurance has equity and solidarity uh<br>as fundamental uh goals at their core at<br>the core<br>social insurance is agnostic of provider<br>whether it's public or private<br>uh and so therefore opens up the<br>resources available in the health system<br>to all<br>so that's my opening comments um i<br>support the reforms uh they will<br>struggle to deliver<br>and we need to rethink around how we<br>fund health if the government's goals<br>uh<br>so<br>thank you for inviting me to speak and<br>participate this evening and as i've<br>been thinking about how best to<br>contribute<br>about<br>the maori aspects of the health reforms<br>i have been i suppose i've noticed that<br>there are very diverse narratives both<br>positive and negative circulating about<br>the maori components of the health care<br>reforms in particular about tiako fayora<br>the maori health authority<br>and my observation is that<br>many people are aware of perhaps one or<br>two aspects of the health care reforms<br>but have very quickly gone into<br>commentary mode as to whether or not for<br>instance the maori health authority is a<br>good thing or a not a good thing<br>so within that context i thought what i<br>would do today is just to describe the<br>maori aspects of the health care reforms<br>a little bit of the context behind them<br>and what i see is some of the<br>opportunities and challenges that we<br>face as we try and navigate forward<br>and i would like to frame my<br>conversation<br>in relation to the aspirations that we<br>have<br>or how these reforms will make a<br>difference<br>and the maori health authority has a<br>whakatauki that underpins their vision<br>shall inherit a better place<br>than we inherited<br>and i think what we see very clearly<br>is that<br>no one will dispute<br>the issue<br>that maori health and multi-health<br>inequities are unacceptable<br>we continue to experience persistent<br>pervasive health inequities<br>and that this exists across conditions<br>across regions<br>darkly in our mortality morbidity and<br>disability data<br>maori are also grossly underrepresented<br>in key parts of the health sector and in<br>particular the health workforce where we<br>see only between two and five percent of<br>most of our registered health<br>professions being maori<br>so analyses of why we have ended up with<br>these inequities have many components to<br>them but it is highlighted that the<br>health sector rather than being a<br>contributor to reducing inequities<br>overall to date has likely contributed<br>to<br>contributing to the presence of these<br>inequities<br>so the reforms that occurred<br>have really um followed on from<br>increasing pressure<br>to<br>ensure that maori rights under the<br>treaty are recognized and acknowledged<br>and that the health sector needs to<br>perform much much better to meet maori<br>needs<br>the y2575 claim for maori health that<br>went through the waitangi tribunal very<br>much highlighted<br>that there needed to be a much greater<br>strengthening of maori presence<br>partnership and leadership in the health<br>sector and that there needed to be<br>sweeping changes in the health sector in<br>order to ensure that we could start to<br>address these inequities so the review<br>of the health sector was very timely and<br>i think for me um the recommendations in<br>the health sector for health sector<br>reform that came out of<br>the review of the health sector provided<br>a really important platform and in<br>particular the recommendation of the<br>maori health authority as well as a much<br>greater maori presence<br>so in looking at the health reforms we<br>see a number of features<br>and these included<br>the establishment of the maori health<br>authority which is now called te<br>akafayoda<br>it also included an expectation not only<br>of the maori health authority but that<br>maori would be partnering with all key<br>aspects of the health sector including<br>tifaji order<br>also maori will continue to have an<br>increased role in the ministry of health<br>supporting policy and in particular<br>having a key role in performance and<br>monitoring<br>there is greater emphasis of tita<br>waitangi and maori health and the<br>priority legislation<br>and also a greater expectation<br>of maori voice<br>at local and regional levels and this is<br>through the establishment of ewe<br>partnership boards and these are to<br>engage and partner with local regional<br>health entities and reflect<br>aspirations of ewe<br>so just unpacking a couple of those<br>things<br>the maori health authority which<br>establishment has outlined in<br>legislation has a number of functions<br>these include<br>policy and partnership with the ministry<br>of health<br>it includes commissioning of mataranga<br>services<br>and co-commissioning working with te<br>fatu ora whanau or at the<br>health new zealand it will work also<br>inter-sectorally and be actively<br>involved in wider policy and service<br>provision including with whanau order<br>and it will be actively engaged with<br>performance and accountability<br>monitoring of the health system<br>it will also be the host and support the<br>ewe partnership boards influence local<br>and regional priorities<br>so many of you will have heard of the<br>ewe partnership boards and currently<br>there are 16 ewe partnership boards that<br>have either been established or close to<br>being fully established and these boards<br>uh have been<br>brought together from<br>bringing ewe<br>who have<br>uh<br>wanting to have a relationship with<br>health and they will be<br>bringing together the ewe<br>relationships with the health sector and<br>will be involved in locality plans and<br>regional plans<br>and so these are very rapidly being<br>developed and as i say there are 16<br>boards now currently in place<br>so for me as someone who's been a<br>long-standing person who's really<br>passionate about maori health i have<br>been optimistic<br>that the platform across<br>these range of<br>processes initiatives<br>new<br>policy<br>and in particular the maori health<br>authority and ewe partnership boards<br>will set us up to be able to do some<br>really important things<br>and i think we should expect to see a<br>much greater influence of maori in the<br>health sector we should see increased<br>opportunities for new and innovative<br>services that really meet maori needs<br>and we should see a lot greater<br>influence by maori into the performance<br>of the health sector overall<br>ultimately i hope that this will lead to<br>the vision that's reflected in that<br>wakatoki<br>my final comments are about the<br>challenges and of course we've already<br>seen some of these challenges coming up<br>in commentary made about the maori<br>health authority whether it should exist<br>or not exist and political statements<br>saying that<br>it should be removed<br>and i think this is very challenging as<br>we know that<br>for such big changes to make a<br>difference we need to give it time we<br>need to give it resourcing and we need<br>to give it support i have been really<br>impressed at how much support there is<br>to have a maori health authority but i<br>very much hope that we are given the<br>scope and the time to be able to help it<br>realise its aspirations<br>thank you<br>thank you very much<br>joe and to uh the two panelists<br>okay well we've had some wonderful<br>questions coming in and we're now going<br>to turn to your questions we will get<br>through as many as we can in the time<br>that we have available<br>and i will be reading off the screen in<br>front of me and i may collect some<br>together because some of them are<br>thematically related<br>and i'll direct the questions to to one<br>or other of our panel members so let's<br>primary care<br>can the panelists share their thoughts<br>on how we should restructure primary<br>care particularly should new zealand<br>continue to have primary care and gps<br>largely be private businesses thank you<br>for the question i'm going to turn to<br>tim first<br>okay thank you very much so i'm going to<br>answer i think perhaps the more easy<br>question which is of course new zealand<br>should continue to have primary public<br>care<br>okay<br>um<br>as i actually collected my initial<br>presentation<br>um<br>strong primary health care<br>health system to have strong primary<br>strong first contact primary health care<br>deliver better outcomes for patients and<br>deliver both individually in terms of<br>their in clinical patients but also<br>specifically in terms of population<br>level okay i need to emphasize that<br>there's good research for that<br>if we move to remove the primary care<br>gatekeeper and we have open access to<br>specialists it will increase costs and<br>it will reduce health outcomes in<br>particular reducing<br>okay<br>um<br>in in terms of restructuring i would<br>like to emphasize that we need to keep<br>we need to keep the core aspects of<br>primary health care<br>for me that means i'm a medical<br>generalist in that i have a i have a<br>general expertise that i apply<br>it's not just medical it's applied<br>across the primary health care team<br>but essentially for us what we need what<br>we want to continue to do and do<br>is that we need to offer first contact<br>sessions to people for new problems<br>particularly if they're urgent problems<br>they need to be the same same day<br>that's about access we need to have<br>access timely access to our services and<br>in those sort of cons consults i was<br>trying to ask the training and expertise<br>that we have makes us very good<br>diagnosticians you know we are the<br>people who see undifferentiated symptoms<br>and we need to make decisions about what<br>those symptoms and what the examination<br>findings mean<br>to be able to come to a range of<br>diagnoses that we can then property to<br>manage<br>but in addition to that<br>it's very important that we provide<br>long-term personal focus personal focus<br>care<br>of people who have these days more than<br>one disease or condition<br>and here importance of continuity care<br>really matters what patients want is<br>they want continuity of care that's<br>often framed as relational continuity<br>with one person over time it doesn't<br>have to be one person it can be members<br>of the team that they trust and that<br>they wish to see<br>and it's important that the system as it<br>goes forward allows to balance the<br>requirements of access which is access<br>to timely care that could actually be<br>delivered by any member of the team<br>versus care with individuals who know<br>that patient and who may well be best<br>placed to manage their increasingly<br>complex needs and those two things are<br>intentional but they they can be<br>balanced<br>and here i think it's a point i'm making<br>about the skills that we have in<br>managing people who have multiple<br>conditions<br>physical conditions mental health<br>conditions<br>in what real life think always be<br>consultations that will require set time<br>i think we need more than 15 minutes<br>even 20 minutes but we still have to get<br>the skills to deal with those issues in<br>a a focused time structure<br>that also then links need for<br>comprehensive care and i need to<br>coordinate so that i think is something<br>that we need that we need to to maintain<br>i i thank you for that that's excellent<br>i'm going to turn to the others have you<br>any comments on this this is very early<br>days the new system was set up on the<br>first of this month<br>and so we are talking right at the<br>beginning of a new system<br>there is no primary health care plan<br>that i think we're aware of yet<br>but presumably the maori health<br>authority in tifatawata the health new<br>zealand will be developing a plan any<br>comments on this<br>i would like to<br>think about<br>the gains that we have made with maori<br>health providers and the models that<br>maori health providers are<br>delivering in relation to what could be<br>considered primary care and of course<br>not just are they<br>for many of them the first port of call<br>for<br>people who need health care but many of<br>them have much broader services that sit<br>in the health promotion<br>well-being health prevention<br>community<br>based and oriented often culturally<br>based and oriented services that are<br>much wider than standard health care so<br>i certainly do see<br>a role for primary health care but<br>within the models that we see with maori<br>health providers i see that embedding of<br>full community responsiveness and<br>engagement and intersectional activity<br>as well as part of those services<br>thank you we'll move on to another<br>question now<br>how committed is a national government<br>like to be<br>uh to the new structure<br>remembering that we have a general<br>election in the latter part of next year<br>and it is entirely<br>uh<br>conceivable that there would be a change<br>of uh a government<br>so i'm going to turn to robin<br>and<br>just see if you've got any<br>wisdom to share on that question<br>well one would hope uh with the benefit<br>of hindsight that a new government would<br>consider that making another radical<br>change so soon is pretty unwise actually<br>also that if it were national league<br>government they were the government that<br>put in place the health funding<br>authority which has very similar<br>characteristics in many ways at the<br>macro level to what's being put in place<br>today with one probably key difference<br>at the macro level and that's the<br>creation of the maori health authority<br>so<br>i wouldn't anticipate that a new<br>government would go in with a change<br>agenda<br>thank you any other additions to that<br>i think as i mentioned in my tour the<br>national government has talked about<br>not keeping the maori health authority i<br>am aware that it isn't legislation and<br>so<br>the um<br>it is a much greater challenge to remove<br>it out of the current health sector than<br>than just<br>signing off on it<br>and so i hope that between now and any<br>time we do get a change in government<br>that the real opportunities that emerge<br>out of the maori health authority will<br>provide a really compelling argument to<br>keep it<br>thank you<br>how will this set of health reforms<br>address chronic health care staffing<br>challenges and can i just say thank you<br>to all of you out there the audience<br>these are excellent questions<br>how will this set of health performers<br>address chronic health care staffing<br>challenges eg maternity services<br>who wants to pick that up joe this is a<br>health workforce question um so i think<br>having one health service that has a<br>lens over the workforce across<br>the whole of the country means that we<br>are<br>able to be thinking about health<br>workforce challenges collectively and i<br>think the changes very much allow us to<br>have a national lens on health workforce<br>i am aware that health workforce has<br>risen in<br>status as a really important policy and<br>service and development issue<br>and i think<br>we should be much better positioned to<br>be able to tackle these really<br>important issues which affect everyone<br>and robin that was the point you made<br>about having a nationally planned system<br>absolutely um<br>and i i think this is going to be<br>absolutely top of the uh the<br>government's agenda in the in the weeks<br>and months ahead um<br>you know we're way way behind where we<br>need to be in terms of health workforce<br>and i think probably over at least the<br>last 10 to 15 years or so we've had some<br>initiatives we had the world health<br>workforce<br>um<br>advisory committee i think it was called<br>which was disbanded five six seven years<br>or so ago um there have been various<br>other initiatives but it's time that we<br>again i think put health workforce front<br>and center i mean joe's already alluded<br>to the<br>need for more maori health professionals<br>we've got a pacific workforce that needs<br>uh more investment and development to<br>primary care general practice you know<br>right across the spectrum there's so<br>much work that needs to be done here and<br>the reforms in the health system will<br>be<br>that you will fail in execution if we<br>don't tackle the tackle the workforce<br>questions<br>thank you tim anything to add to that<br>it's such a crucial question i guess i<br>just go back to my headline comment that<br>we need a high functioning workforce<br>with hundreds of motivation and it isn't<br>just about numbers<br>nor is it just about enumeration that<br>that is important it is about providing<br>an organization a culture where people<br>can thrive<br>thank you<br>i like the term intrinsic motivation<br>this is a long question i'll read it out<br>if communities are more able to direct<br>their care through locality plans<br>in terms of purchasing there may be<br>differences in services available<br>between localities through different<br>service services provided in the<br>locality plans<br>is this any different to the postcode<br>lotteries that were talked about as a<br>problem in the previous system<br>i might turn to robin to kick this one<br>off<br>i think this question raises a really<br>fundamental point<br>and we do need local input<br>there are great variations across the<br>country in terms of um<br>how people function what their needs are<br>and so forth but we also need to ensure<br>that we are able to um respond in the<br>right way around questions of access and<br>equity and and so there's a real tension<br>i think here between creation of the<br>localities and then trying to get some<br>national consistency because i think the<br>last thing that anyone wants with this<br>current set of reforms is to set up<br>another postcode lottery as it might be<br>called<br>thank you anything to add to that joe or<br>tim<br>i think for me um the balance between<br>having the voice of the community and<br>what they need with oversight nationally<br>about<br>where there may be emerging inequity so<br>some of this is about the information<br>that we have and we're able to have<br>about<br>whether the health service provision is<br>actually meeting the needs of the<br>community that it has and it becomes a<br>problem<br>if that service provision is inequitable<br>and so the information we have i think<br>will help us<br>deal with that tension as it arises<br>thank you<br>i suppose my only comment really is on<br>this one is that it is it's it's not<br>just about whether the service developer<br>knowledge whether it's a high quality<br>service whether it's best practice<br>whether it delivers the right treatment<br>and i think we do need<br>to be better at identifying what best<br>care is in the range of disease and<br>making sure that we can commission<br>deliver services for that<br>but that doesn't mean that different<br>lookouts have different local needs in<br>which of these services they choose to<br>prioritize i think thank you<br>one more point thanks joe's one i think<br>that's really critical the information<br>because at the moment we know that<br>you'll get your um consoles dealt with<br>in hawke's bay but not here you'll get<br>your gallstones done in auckland but not<br>in hawke's bay and<br>i mean these are the issues that we're<br>going to continue to grapple with and so<br>the information around<br>um consistency is going to be really<br>critical albeit within a localised<br>next question what would you hope to see<br>as priorities<br>for the new system while it in its and<br>while it is in its first two years of<br>establishment<br>tim should we kick off with you on this<br>one yeah i mean i suppose i suppose my<br>main observation is that the<br>transformative change is going to take<br>time<br>so we need to be patient<br>but i think well i think i think the<br>priority at the moment is to stabilize<br>the existing<br>health system because i think as i've as<br>we've articulated the current system is<br>under agenda incredible strain at the<br>moment<br>and certainly i do see primary health<br>care as to some extent at risk of<br>entering a spiral a downward spiral<br>i mean<br>just just to give you one example i mean<br>i've heard medical students talk about a<br>career in general practice at the moment<br>and the comments are usually of the<br>disorder first of all i think flagging<br>up i think um the issue<br>about a lot of job practices about<br>individuals consulting with patients and<br>about the need for better team working i<br>think i think we can fix that i think<br>that's already happening but the other<br>problems is more difficult i think<br>comments about observing the gps<br>practice noise of the members of primary<br>healthcare team are under stress<br>and also a feeling of disempowerment<br>that their voice is not being heard that<br>they're not able to influence how the<br>health system's going<br>um and i think that is a problem<br>and thirdly and i do wish and thirdly i<br>think with those of us who have the<br>benefit of having fully funded education<br>cannot underestimate the impact of<br>doctors changing the system with larger<br>debts to pay off<br>and at the moment as a doctor it is not<br>financially attractive to go into a<br>career in general practice so the<br>problem with that is that you will then<br>end up with a system people not going<br>into the same system people will retire<br>and you have preroom for your doctors or<br>unhealth professionals in primary care<br>able to deliver system i've described<br>and the system runs the risk of of of i<br>think of serious damage so i think we<br>need to have some way of stabilizing<br>the current system<br>um we haven't<br>specifically talked about the business<br>model of general practice but we have to<br>remember that at the moment the majority<br>of care is provided in traditional<br>business and practices<br>and whatever the future looks like i<br>think we have to stabilize care in those<br>practices through proper enumeration and<br>proper support there's a decapitation<br>with you under the gun<br>we await the result of that and i think<br>it's really important whatever shape the<br>health reforms took we look at building<br>on the strength of the system that we<br>have and we don't automatically assume<br>we need to change the business model<br>thank you<br>so this one's<br>going to be for joe<br>by way of warning<br>if the christchurch model was successful<br>why would centralized health systems be<br>better than local authorities having<br>control of local needs<br>well i think<br>if the<br>health<br>reforms<br>work we have the opportunity to have<br>both things happening<br>so we obviously have<br>a central<br>capacity to<br>oversee and be able to get information<br>about what's happening<br>in different areas and across localities<br>understanding issues of equity<br>um and then i think<br>the opportunities then for those<br>relationships to be happening at a local<br>level and i see from a maori perspective<br>we've got the ewe maori partnership<br>boards for instance really influencing<br>what happens locally so i don't<br>necessarily see it as an either or i see<br>it as a potential for an end and<br>how it comes together and how it works<br>so that we get the best of both<br>local and central benefits i think is<br>the challenge of the health reforms<br>i'm just wondering if another question<br>is going to come up these are superb<br>questions<br>here we go<br>could<br>and new zealand have the foresight to<br>give the<br>maori health authority<br>order the kaupapa to drive for all<br>to drive for or<br>health holder in<br>as the current and past health system<br>has failed and continues to fail<br>if no why not if yes<br>how do you see it helping our order<br>process for all aotearoa<br>wonderful question<br>and we'll pick on you robin to start<br>this one off<br>um no you're absolutely right i mean<br>that's a wonderful question a really<br>important one<br>um<br>i i think i mean the maori health<br>authority now i'm really excited about<br>um<br>some may recall as um if they're<br>historians of<br>health<br>health system and new zealand and policy<br>discussions about 30 years ago<br>when the competitive<br>system in new zealand was being created<br>there was a very large discussion and i<br>think was the far north area<br>around setting up a um a sort of a maori<br>health authority for that region and at<br>the time the government of the day was<br>not not sort of prepared to<br>to endorse that model<br>um<br>and so for me it's a very exciting<br>time to have the mha coming into place<br>um and that's for a whole range of<br>reasons as i've been discussed tonight<br>so i won't go over them but i think also<br>because the mha to me is going to be<br>able to ask some really fundamental<br>questions and<br>i said that at the outset<br>how is this system serving us and so<br>when i ask that question i ask is the<br>access to for instance a private<br>treatment which people with you know<br>reasonably deep pockets<br>or insurance can access<br>many maori have<br>no opportunity to access the private<br>sector and so so it's that ability to<br>ask those questions which affect<br>many new zealanders who are on lower<br>incomes or who don't have insurance and<br>bring some accountability so<br>to debate i think is going to be really<br>important so i would hope that it will<br>succeed in that way<br>um the failure i don't want to sort of<br>go there really um i think we<br>need to just sort of carry on with with<br>the reforms is planned at the moment and<br>give it time to be there<br>thank you joe also many comments on this<br>question<br>for me<br>when i look at<br>what maori health providers many of them<br>have been able to achieve<br>as they navigate through space through<br>being really responsive to the<br>communities that they serve so although<br>they're called maori health authorities<br>and when we look at covert response we<br>saw this they were reaching and engaging<br>with communities<br>that had a lived reality that they were<br>aware of what their needs were and we're<br>developing services in our developing<br>services to meet those needs<br>and so i think if we're thinking about<br>equity<br>i do hope that maori the maori health<br>authority and the kinds of innovative<br>and responsive services that come out of<br>that maori health provision<br>arena will in fact potentially guide and<br>lead many other services<br>thank you<br>tim anything to add to that no except i<br>think that's a very interesting question<br>and one of the things i think i've<br>learned through moving to terror eight<br>years ago is the dynamism and the<br>inherence i've seen through my health<br>providers and my team deliver and i<br>think it's a really good question to ask<br>actually<br>very good question here there doesn't<br>seem to be much empirical evidence that<br>supports a centralized health system<br>with layers of decision making<br>do you know if there's any evidence<br>who wants to kick off with that<br>well i'll just make a brief comment that<br>i made at the outset we had the health<br>funding authority of the late 1990s and<br>you know there was there was good<br>evidence i mean i wrote a book i'll have<br>to get it off the shelf it's 21 years<br>old now called revolving doors and there<br>is pretty good evidence in that book<br>that indicates that the health funding<br>authority was the best of the bunch<br>through that period in time<br>so we do have the evidence that a<br>centralized<br>model can can work and<br>we're a small country um you know having<br>20<br>separate systems across the country with<br>a lack of ability to coordinate and<br>share information around the most basic<br>of things is to me just plain wrong so<br>the evidence is there go find the book<br>it's still available in libraries i<br>think<br>thank you<br>tim joe anything to add to that evidence<br>for a centralized system no no<br>okay<br>here we turn to acc<br>acc covers accidents beautifully this<br>question asks what is to stop new<br>zealand having a parallel system for<br>medicine eyes and dental<br>to help address inequities<br>um look at oh oh there we go um i've put<br>my cards on the table and said that i<br>feel we need to have a<br>a a deep and involved debate in this<br>country um<br>around<br>social insurance<br>so social insurance would be broader<br>than just eyes and dental it may well<br>include that if you look at<br>many of the countries that have social<br>insurance they include dental care as<br>well<br>and so you know there's nothing to stop<br>us doing this we just need to get on<br>with the debate and<br>work out how it might work for us and<br>then it would require i think a strong<br>political leadership and to me the<br>timing is absolutely right to be getting<br>on with this debate<br>and bringing it to the highest political<br>so this is about models of funding yes<br>right and you're referring to a social<br>insurance system of<br>funding which acc is of course<br>absolutely yeah<br>and any comments joe or tim<br>i suppose for me and principal it has<br>always seemed<br>challenging if you have a disability<br>from an accident that allows you to have<br>ready access to<br>physiotherapy occupational therapy<br>pathways back into employment but if you<br>have a stroke that leads you with the<br>same<br>same disability that you're really<br>reliant on kind of<br>services that are not necessarily ones<br>that have the same<br>same quality or same expectation to get<br>you back to well-being so i i would very<br>much<br>like to see<br>that there is some thought about how we<br>could ensure that people can get the<br>same level of care and if it involves a<br>different system then i think that could<br>be really appropriate or<br>that we actually have a really clear<br>lens on what high quality care is<br>and it shouldn't matter whether you've<br>you've achieved your health issue<br>through an accident or whether it is<br>because you<br>sadly had a stroke or another reason for<br>that so some of it is around<br>the standards that we should be<br>so<br>it has always struck me that we have the<br>i'm coming to work here from the nhs<br>that we actually do have a hybrid system<br>because the gp we see a lot of patients<br>who have accidents who we need to refer<br>to the icc process the first example<br>would be you know a young person skiing<br>who has a string accent on their knee<br>they can then access timely appropriate<br>quick treatment for that injury to<br>recover including rehabilitation and<br>then of course you see some of the heart<br>sensitive knee arthritis there are no<br>surgery available to help them and<br>manage their progression of their<br>illness before they deteriorate with<br>their knee and then they end up having<br>an operation like with problems and<br>that's scandalous really<br>and then the other problem with the<br>partial system is is is that you<br>probably spend as much time trying to<br>assess whether something<br>could or couldn't be covered then<br>actually is covered because it means<br>there's a lot of adjudication going on<br>because injury is not straightforward<br>and and and and eligibility is not<br>straightforward a whole lot of work has<br>to be done in determining whether<br>historic injuries are or not hcc and<br>that involves a lot of paperwork and a<br>lot of management<br>so i think there have to be questions<br>asked at the moment about whether in<br>fact we should have a serious debate<br>about extending hcc<br>so that we can actually better ensure<br>broader cover and look at how that could<br>be<br>organized so that it delivers to better<br>care<br>but it doesn't generate if it's not<br>fully covering everything it doesn't<br>generate a lot of work in terms of<br>adjudicating what is an acc claim and<br>what may be the rest of the public<br>system and i think it doesn't need<br>seriously looking at<br>thank you to all of you for that<br>so this is probably going to be our last<br>question because we're coming up to 8<br>o'clock<br>how will the reforms improve recruitment<br>and retention of the workforce<br>when there are global challenges<br>regarding these issues<br>and joe i think you need to start on<br>this because you have such an interest<br>in health workforce issues<br>i think<br>we have<br>we currently don't have a health<br>workforce strategy or plan<br>we have really patchy information about<br>our health workforce and<br>um<br>and also there's real differences<br>between different regions and areas as<br>to which workforce is short<br>and<br>in different places taking on different<br>strategies in order to address those<br>being able to think nationally about our<br>health workforce needs being able to<br>understand<br>where there are gaps and also how we can<br>support the growth and the development<br>of workforce sort of nationally i think<br>will be really important i think the<br>tricky thing that we have at the moment<br>is that this is a crisis right<br>now<br>and i i suppose what i would hope is<br>that having one national<br>health service would allow us to be able<br>to engage<br>both internally within new zealand and<br>externally with people to have a much<br>more direct relationship over health<br>workforce rather than<br>people needing to<br>try and engage with potential roles in<br>different dhbs and different services<br>and i would hope that the health<br>workforce prioritization that i think is<br>happening right now would mean that we<br>can do some of this quite quickly<br>we wouldn't be able to do this with 20<br>dhbs i think<br>thank you<br>when this is a big question and um<br>i don't know that any country has<br>even started to think about how to solve<br>it<br>i mean it's a race around pay rates um<br>terms and conditions which many will say<br>are much better in australia<br>and so it's a deep it's a deep challenge<br>and it's going to take us many many<br>years i think to try and solve part of<br>it's about trying to create more<br>training places<br>measures to try and um keep people in<br>the country and<br>working productively here as well so<br>managing well-being and<br>stress and so forth which i think are<br>also really critical<br>um issues that we need to to grapple<br>with in terms of helpful health<br>workforce so<br>i don't think there's an easy answer to<br>this question i guess is what i'm trying<br>to say<br>and tim it does sort of come back to you<br>or one of your initial points about<br>innate motivation<br>intrinsic motivation intrinsic<br>motivation<br>i think so<br>but i i guess from the workforce point<br>and i'll say i think it is recognizing<br>at this point we do need to have an<br>international medical graduate workforce<br>as well as a needs venture and workforce<br>and we just need i think to look at ways<br>that we go beyond the reforms to ensure<br>the government as a whole is working<br>together in terms of basically allowing<br>people<br>with the right qualifications as girls<br>to come to new zealand to work<br>and hopefully through that<br>because if we if we achieve what we want<br>to achieve with this health system<br>why wouldn't anybody want to come to<br>work in atari<br>thank you that's an excellent note on<br>which to finish<br>and it is time to wrap up i would like<br>on behalf of all of us to extend a warm<br>thanks to our panelists for sharing your<br>expertise your insights and your<br>thoughts about the health reforms thank<br>you so much<br>thank you the audience<br>for uh attending this evening and also<br>for those excellent and perceptive<br>questions and we could carry on for<br>another two hours so there's a lot of<br>questions coming in<br>thank you to the organizers of the<br>winter symposium series and the amazing<br>finally<br>this is one of a series of winter<br>symposiums<br>there are two more in the series the<br>next one is on the third of august and<br>is on the topic of sustainability<br>and then the last one is on the 10th of<br>august and is on inequality<br>thank you very much for attending</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
