i'm<br>delighted to warmly uh welcome you to<br>the return of the university of otago's<br>winter symposium series after a two-year<br>break due to covid19<br>the annual series is an opportunity for<br>academic thinkers to connect with the<br>community and discuss the big issues<br>that matter to new zealanders<br>tonight we are<br>beginning the winter symposium series<br>with a focus on the putin regime's<br>full-scale invasion of ukraine and its<br>consequences<br>but please note in in your diaries that<br>on the 27th of july<br>week on from now<br>professor peter crampton will be leading<br>a university of otago symposium<br>session on another very important topic<br>namely<br>an uh an examination of altaro's new<br>health system a band-aid or a<br>life-saving<br>surgery<br>so please make a note of that in your<br>diaries now before proceeding further<br>tonight i have the privilege and the<br>pleasure to introduce two panelists who<br>will be contributing greatly to our<br>proceedings this evening between them<br>they have tremendous expertise on russia<br>and the ukraine and will hopefully help<br>us to demystify an event that is the<br>russian invasion of ukraine that has<br>severely shaken the security<br>architecture of europe<br>and sent economic and diplomatic shock<br>waves around the world<br>our guest panelist is professor natalia<br>chaban from the department of media and<br>communication at the university of<br>canterbury natalia focuses her<br>interdisciplinary search on cognitive<br>and semiotic aspects of political and<br>media discourses within the context of<br>the eu<br>and international relations<br>i should add natalia is a twice awarded<br>jean monet chair<br>president sorry john maynard chair also<br>president of the ukrainian<br>studies association of australia and new<br>zealand co-editor of the peer-reviewed<br>australian new zealand journal of<br>european studies<br>in addition i also had the pleasure of<br>introducing associate professor jim<br>headley from the politics program at the<br>university of otago jim specializes in<br>russian foreign policy the european<br>union<br>nationalism and ethnic conflict he is<br>the author of the highly regarded book<br>russia and the balkans foreign policy<br>from yeltsin to putin published by<br>hearst and columbia university press and<br>co-editor of public participation in<br>foreign policy published by palgrave<br>macmillan 2012.<br>now for the next five minutes i'd just<br>like to set the scene<br>for jim and natalya to take up some of<br>the issues which have been<br>occasioned<br>by russia's invasion of ukraine<br>president putin's decision on the 24th<br>of february<br>2022<br>to launch what he called a special<br>military operation against neighbouring<br>ukraine constituted the greatest use of<br>force in europe<br>since 1945 by one state against another<br>the conflict has now been going on for<br>nearly five months<br>and the number of civilian and military<br>casualties has been very high<br>reliable figures are hard to come by but<br>the un has estimated that ukraine has<br>lost more than 5 000 civilians since the<br>invasion<br>military casualties are also higher it's<br>widely believed that russia has lost<br>more than 20 000 soldiers<br>on the battlefield while ukraine's<br>military losses are estimated around 15<br>000 but<br>kiev kiev's military strengths have<br>risen more sharply with uh military<br>sorry military deaths have risen more<br>sharply uh with the intensification of<br>recent fighting in the eastern part of<br>the country<br>to date the conflict in ukraine seems to<br>have been characterized by two distinct<br>phases<br>phase one consisted of putin's army<br>trying to over overwhelm ukraine and<br>decapitate the silence government in a<br>matter of four or five days that<br>blitzkrieg effort<br>failed due to ukraine's staunch defense<br>and the surprisingly ineffective<br>military performance of russia's mix of<br>professional and consulate troops<br>phase two of the conflict which is the<br>current phase of the conflict is one<br>where the putin government has been<br>forced to focus and consolidate its<br>military efforts on the donbass luhans<br>front in the eastern part of the country<br>it should be added that conflict between<br>putin's regime and the ukraine first<br>erupted in march 2014<br>after putin's russia annexed crimea and<br>then intervened in the donbass region of<br>eastern ukraine to support armed<br>separatists<br>putin's justification for authorizing<br>the special military operation in<br>february of this year<br>was that he felt he had quote no choice<br>unquote after diplomatic efforts to<br>solve what he said was a major security<br>problem in the ukraine had failed<br>mr putin made two key diplomatic demands<br>he demanded that nato membership for<br>ukraine must be permanently ruled out<br>and that nato should pull back from<br>eastern europe to a position that he<br>occupied before the enlargement of nato<br>after 1997. the biden administration and<br>nato leaders rejected<br>putin's mr putin's demands<br>it is clear that the putin regime's<br>invasion of ukraine was a flagrant<br>violation of the u.n charter it<br>confirmed what's apparently been<br>evident for much of the post-cold war<br>period the u.n security council is no<br>longer<br>fit for purpose<br>it's also worth highlighting that the<br>jacinda ardern government believes it<br>has a big stake<br>in helping ukraine defeat<br>mr putin's assertiveness<br>since march the new zealand government<br>has extended a multifaceted aid package<br>to ukraine worth more than 38 million<br>new zealand dollars<br>so if<br>putin's ukraine invasion has been a<br>defining moment for the international<br>order in the 21st century<br>um how do we explain this rapid sequence<br>of events and what do they mean<br>it gives me great pleasure now to call<br>on uh jim jim headley and and jim going<br>to speak for about 10 minutes thank you<br>all right thank you very much robert and<br>kiyora koto<br>um<br>really i'm going to focus on how we<br>might attempt to explain putin's<br>aggression against ukraine<br>it seems a while ago now but<br>all of us even those of us who have<br>studied this and have spent<br>many years writing about russian foreign<br>policy had a very severe sense of shock<br>on the 24th of february despite russian<br>buildup of troops<br>and the past aggressions by the russian<br>regime and this shock i think was due<br>partly to the scale of it which roberts<br>mentioned<br>and also i think the immediate<br>realization that there was no way back<br>no obvious potential peaceful settlement<br>which i think remains the case<br>um<br>what i'm interested in<br>covering here is we're limited in time<br>is beyond putin's own spurious<br>justifications whether there we can<br>look back and see that in some ways<br>it's it can be explained<br>in terms of our understanding of russian<br>foreign policy<br>and i would say that it results partly<br>from an intersection<br>of developments in domestic russian<br>politics and ideology<br>in particular putin's development of<br>thinking about the nation<br>and<br>a broader and more widespread<br>development in russian foreign policy<br>thinking<br>so when putin<br>returned to power<br>in 2012 as president<br>there were protests about the way this<br>had been manufactured<br>and putin<br>was able to subdue these protests<br>and then<br>used his renewed power to consolidate<br>what people have called a conservative<br>turn in russian politics<br>um really resisting illiberalism as he<br>saw it of the west and of those<br>opponents of him and seeing<br>opponents in russia as agents of the<br>west<br>and the medan revolution in ukraine was<br>portrayed within this framework and in<br>fact further contributed to its<br>development<br>during that period russia<br>really turned its back on the european<br>union<br>and the new ukrainian authorities were<br>portrayed as lackeys of the eu and also<br>the us<br>i think also in putin's mind there was a<br>sense of threat that if ukraine<br>successfully transitioned to a liberal<br>democracy<br>and particularly<br>orientated towards the west with the eu<br>and nato then this would be a threat to<br>putin's regime itself<br>so in some ways ukraine came to stand as<br>a sort of outpost of the liberal west<br>that russia was now opposed to<br>but really quite contradictorily um<br>we've seen that putin<br>has this narrative of ukraine being a<br>fascist state that needs denudification<br>the grounds for this outrageous claim<br>were laid by exaggerating the role of<br>ukrainian nationalists in ukrainian<br>politics and also in military activities<br>since 2014<br>um but also by belittling the idea of<br>ukrainian separate nationhood<br>putin's nationalism is actually often<br>contradictory<br>but in an article last july he laid out<br>a thesis denying that there is a<br>separate ukrainian nation separate from<br>the russian one<br>any ukrainian nation-building efforts<br>are therefore presented as extreme<br>nationalism that threatens russians in<br>ukraine and the wider russian nation<br>it's worth noting that the rhetoric<br>about denuncification also fits the<br>longest standing central plank of<br>putin's nationalism which is the<br>mythology of the great patriotic war the<br>victory in the second world war so he is<br>now selling the invasion of ukraine<br>as a repeat of that<br>so the july article last year could be<br>seen as laying the basis for the<br>invasion<br>indeed i recently met my former phd<br>supervisor and he said that after<br>reading that article last year he was<br>convinced<br>that putin was going to try and crush<br>ukraine and simply<br>he regrets the fact he didn't write an<br>article about it at the time um putin<br>repeated many of the claims of that<br>article in his rambling addresses<br>at the start of the invasion directed<br>both for the foreign audiences but<br>particularly russian audience<br>i think it's hard to tell how much putin<br>believes in this narrative but i do<br>think he has convinced himself<br>and we can also point to other<br>explanations focusing on putin as an<br>individual that he's been in power too<br>long and is too isolated<br>some people remark on his kgb background<br>and that he's now trying to reverse the<br>breakup of the soviet union<br>like the coup plotters<br>uh in august 1991 trying to prevent it<br>including the head of the kgb then<br>and some of this may be true but i think<br>to understand the invasion we also need<br>to realize that it fits into a wider<br>and more long-standing thinking about<br>foreign policy within the moscow elite<br>after the breakup of the soviet union<br>there was a brief period when the<br>russian leadership under president<br>yeltsin pursued what analysts called the<br>liberal westernizing from policy<br>russia was supposed to be transitioning<br>rapidly to a liberal democracy and as<br>such would be a natural ally of liberal<br>democratic states of the west<br>for a number of reasons including<br>domestic challenges<br>um by the mid 1990s there'd been a major<br>shift away from this foreign policy<br>approach<br>the dominant approach from then on has<br>been what<br>international relations scholars call a<br>realist approach<br>one which<br>claims that all states have their own<br>national interests that those may<br>conflict with each other and that every<br>state needs to stand up for its<br>interests by any means possible<br>and particularly great power such as<br>russia which may include consolidating a<br>sphere of influence in this case in the<br>form of soviet space<br>the other thing worth noting is that<br>actions by other states or organizations<br>are interpreted interpreted within this<br>framework so that nato enlargement<br>for example is interpreted as a direct<br>threat against russian interests and<br>when this approach came in it was known<br>as pragmatic realism because<br>the leadership still then yeltsin<br>actually<br>realized that russia was weak and<br>isolated<br>but putin when he came to power in<br>1999-2000<br>focused on making russia strong again<br>on rebuilding russia's economy<br>particularly through<br>energy exports and with the rising<br>prices of energy exports<br>and the russian military and<br>demonstrating a willingness to use force<br>first in chechnya and russia itself<br>then georgia then ukraine in 2014<br>in syria and now again in ukraine<br>so i think although the scale<br>of the current invasion is different<br>and the violation of international law<br>and norms more blatant we can still<br>position it within a develop a<br>developing evolution<br>of<br>russian foreign policy and putin's own<br>thinking<br>but i think that is not to excuse it to<br>explain is not to excuse and nor is it<br>necessarily to blame the west or in fact<br>i certainly would say not to blame the<br>west for the invasion through<br>antagonizing russia<br>nor is it to argue that it was<br>inevitable<br>even realists including in moscow may<br>well disagree about whether this<br>actually is in russia's uh national<br>interests or real interests<br>but in retrospect i think positioning it<br>in this wider context and historical<br>evolution does perhaps make the invasion<br>a bit less surprising<br>if nevertheless still shocking<br>thank you very much jim um natalia have<br>you got any um<br>questions for jim or comments that you<br>may have<br>thank you robert thank you jim that was<br>a very<br>enlightening and very interesting<br>opening to our discussion and since<br>you're talking about foreign policy my<br>question is while the narratives were<br>introduced and goals of real politics<br>were laid down<br>would you um agree that<br>eventually that the goals were not<br>achieved nato has become stronger and<br>closer to the russian federation um<br>ukraine<br>has solidified its um nationhood<br>even the regions those regions who speak<br>russian uh predominantly in the east<br>over ukraine are now more pro-ukrainian<br>than they used to be and uh the project<br>of the russian world ruskimir um of sort<br>of um appealing to to a bigger world in<br>specifically russian-speaking bigger<br>world<br>is it's probably in in danger or if<br>probably it's already finished so sort<br>of um<br>what what is the result we the foreign<br>policy seems to be not achieving the<br>goals it really wanted to achieve<br>and i think that's one of the puzzles<br>because i think putin<br>previously was fairly<br>pragmatic fairly opportunistic and this<br>seems to go beyond that so i do agree<br>with that<br>i think partly<br>this is where maybe individual<br>explanations come in this sort of idea<br>that maybe he's after a legacy maybe<br>he kind of reached his limit i'd like to<br>sort of mention that in some ways he<br>sort of almost seems to feel himself<br>epitomizing russia now so he takes all<br>of these sort of insults which he sees<br>russia is having gone through his<br>personal insults and vice versa<br>so this might have pushed him forward<br>but i do agree actually and and that was<br>i suppose part of my point at the end<br>of and and there's a wider context of<br>this in the debate about how we<br>interpret it because um realists in the<br>united states such as mishima so just<br>take this at face value and say any<br>russian leader would have done this and<br>therefore the west shouldn't have<br>alienated russia and so on i do think it<br>is a serious miscalculation and it does<br>actually seem to kind of<br>uh<br>really kind of question the degree to<br>which putin is kind of calculating<br>rationally these interests i've actually<br>participated in and observed similar<br>sort of panels where<br>hardcore realists international<br>relations scholars have sort of said<br>well this is totally in russia's<br>interests of course they're going to try<br>and kind of control the black sea<br>they're going to try and prevent nato<br>enlargement and things but i think<br>that's taking a very kind of narrow<br>picture<br>i think and it may actually well<br>backfire uh back on putin himself<br>although i think there is that shared<br>thinking among the broader elite as i<br>say<br>um i don't think there's necessarily<br>that strong support behind this and<br>certainly the way it may well kind of<br>lead to disturbances within russia and<br>as you say actually the wider russian<br>mere the the right of russian world<br>um<br>and also where does it put russia um we<br>see today<br>putin making his first visit outside the<br>former soviet space since the start of<br>it to iran<br>but who's his friends now iran china<br>for many russians they see themselves as<br>european and<br>and this is where sanctions and things<br>are hitting kind of the middle classes<br>that they're used to traveling to europe<br>they see their identity in europe so<br>in trying to kind of understand it i<br>think there is a kind of balancing<br>between sort of saying this is partly<br>the kind of natural outcome of this way<br>of thinking but also saying well in some<br>ways it doesn't really match that<br>thinking because it seems to be against<br>russian interest<br>jim can i ask you um just following up<br>from natalya's question<br>um you laid out very nicely how<br>putin's incursion full-scale incursion<br>into ukraine did not come out of the<br>blue it was part of a sort of you know<br>growing assertiveness in foreign policy<br>going back some time<br>but<br>i just wondered from your point of view<br>do you think there's any particular<br>triggering factors um internationally or<br>nationally<br>that made mr putin quite confident<br>because i agree with you it seems on the<br>yeah on the basis of what we've seen a<br>horrific miscalculation and yet<br>you know<br>why did he make this move in 2022 oh why<br>didn't he make it in 2018 for example so<br>i just wonder if you from your point of<br>view as a russian specialist was any<br>factors that you think really loomed<br>large<br>well no not really i mean there was<br>still talk about you know there was kind<br>of moves towards maybe ukraine<br>firming up his position certainly in<br>relation to the eu and also nato<br>including<br>uh adjustments to the constitution so it<br>can be presented like that but i do<br>remember in the lead up to the invasion<br>as the troops were building on<br>on the border<br>and making the point this is going to be<br>totally unprovoked because there's<br>nothing sparked it we were talking then<br>about it being a crisis but i almost<br>refused to use the word because it was a<br>totally manufactured crisis so i would<br>actually argue no<br>i think in the longer term we can ask a<br>bit more about whether there were<br>kind of events which maybe pushed russia<br>more into this sort of thing i i<br>recently had interesting discussions<br>with um colleagues overseas about this<br>about one of them sort of asking was<br>there a kind of single event that maybe<br>the west did wrong which kind of pushed<br>it this way and even there it's hard to<br>tell i mean<br>um<br>iraq of course was a full-scale invasion<br>against sovereignty and so on um<br>the kosovo war um<br>recognition of kosovo<br>uh nato enlargement as a whole so we can<br>kind of point to things which might have<br>turned out differently but even then i i<br>have my doubts about um<br>whether um<br>that would have totally adjusted the<br>overall trajectory of russian foreign<br>policy and particularly a way of<br>thinking that might have seen those as<br>weaknesses if they hadn't happened i<br>mean it acts different but uh other<br>cases as weaknesses and uh and therefore<br>to be exploited by a leader such as<br>putin yeah i mean this is we can return<br>to this point one thing that struck me<br>when you were talking jim that it seemed<br>to mr putin was very skeptical that the<br>west could act decisively and in a<br>coordinated fashion to this type of<br>incursion that we've witnessed but let's<br>natalia would you like to now present<br>for us your your your talking points and<br>your thoughts on the situation we're<br>looking forward to it<br>um thank you robert thank you jim<br>my name is natalia chavan and i'm from<br>the university of canterbury i would<br>like to say big thank you to the<br>organizers of the winter symposium at<br>the university of otago for inviting me<br>to present with my wonderful colleagues<br>jim and robert a great owner and as a<br>political communications person i<br>thought i will start with something<br>which is very obvious to everyone any<br>war attracts media attention and as an<br>expert in political communication i will<br>talk today more about information flows<br>around<br>the the war of russia against ukraine um<br>but specifically highlights the fact<br>that it's perhaps one of the first wars<br>we witness in the environment of new<br>media ecology<br>newspapers<br>were very keen to cover wars<br>during 19th and the beginning of the<br>20th century we think world war ii and<br>radio vietnam war in television the iraq<br>war and satellite television and now we<br>have this war and it takes place in the<br>new media ecology so my big question of<br>this presentation what does it mean to<br>how we conceive this war how we imagine<br>this war and how we learn and know about<br>this war<br>in the scholarship of political<br>communication<br>new media ecology is seen sort of from<br>two perspectives perspective number one<br>is uh seen as a positive specifically in<br>democratic societies why we build<br>bridges we're linked to communities we<br>haven't linked before look we are in<br>this event we are presenting i'm from<br>christchurch i have my colleagues in<br>dunedin and we have big audience sitting<br>in many different places we built a<br>community we would never be able to<br>build without digital tools<br>but it's also about faster mobilization<br>of citizens of people in the country and<br>around the world but it's also about<br>empowering citizens it's also about<br>emancipating citizens citizens have<br>access to information but also they can<br>circumvent traditional channels and<br>exert pressure on<br>decision makers on opinion makers on the<br>scale not seen before think about public<br>opinion around the world addressing<br>their governments to help ukraine and<br>then a scholarship talks about some<br>negative perspectives uh something<br>called clicktivism when people<br>uh sort of click the like and move on<br>they think i've reached it i've<br>contributed but no real action and we're<br>all well aware of missing disinformation<br>fake news echo chambers polarization and<br>since mr miss and disinformation are<br>such a big part of any information flows<br>around the war<br>um it is what it is um this will be even<br>bigger and um uh internet<br>first was seen as impossible to be<br>regulated by governments but at the<br>moment we know that it can be there is<br>centralization of power and there is all<br>sorts of ethical issues so for me what<br>is interesting is to see the<br>intersection of these perspectives was<br>the three techniques used in any war<br>communication these are propaganda<br>psychological operations as well as miss<br>and disinformation we'll see how we<br>covered giving time available the big<br>stock for me first is propaganda and<br>propaganda if we think um into the<br>definition of this event oxford<br>dictionary tells us it is a systematic<br>scheme concerted movement for the<br>propagation of a particular doctrine and<br>practice which suggests it actually<br>needs time to develop and when jim was<br>talking about this conservative<br>turn and if we think that russian<br>public didn't react to the war in<br>ukraine how we all thought<br>normal people will react reacting to<br>casualties reacting to atrocities<br>reacting to to death and i mean war is<br>is a major tragic event um we may think<br>about propaganda tactics used by the<br>russian government for decades but<br>definitely as jim mentioned year 2012 uh<br>definitely<br>from that<br>period in time here i'm tuning to a<br>colleague from columbia university mark<br>lipavick who is a scholar of literature<br>and culture and he proposes three<br>points which i think jim will add to<br>your argument you've just shared with us<br>you looked into political development<br>now i'm talking about cultural<br>ideological development<br>according to lipavick one of the first<br>features which<br>got solidified since 2012 is the cult of<br>suffering it's sort of the idea that the<br>people in the russian federation have<br>this monopoly on suffering they suffered<br>the law during world war ii they won<br>during world war ii so<br>sufferings of others in comparison they<br>just cannot compare their waning the<br>second one is the industry of nostalgia<br>for everything soviet and it's very<br>carefully cultivated and it's also very<br>diversified here we're talking about<br>entertainment industry some shows<br>started as pure entertainment then<br>became successful commercial and then<br>became imperial projects for example old<br>songs about main issues think about<br>eateries<br>which are serving dishes from the former<br>soviet union or tv series thousands of<br>them<br>which are<br>representing sort of the utopian picture<br>of the late soviet union beautiful faces<br>aesthetically beautiful great songs and<br>that utopian feel of the ussr was so<br>cultivated that even people born after<br>the collapse of the ussr become<br>nostalgic for the ussr and for lupinsky<br>the third<br>entry is the culture of cynicism<br>and it is inherited from the soviet<br>culture um it's the the idea of after<br>the collapse of the soviet union<br>everybody steals everybody lies why<br>cannot i do it and as such it is okay to<br>violate the rules it's okay to violate<br>the bodies instead of these these were<br>culturally reproduced and um circulated<br>and propagated um with a lot of<br>intention so if we think about why<br>russian people do not change their minds<br>immediately<br>we should definitely think about the<br>fact that certain developments were<br>happening for at least a decade<br>but now looking at the ukrainian side i<br>think that successes and propaganda by<br>ukrainian side are actually very much<br>linked to the new media ecology and a<br>very successful innovative way of<br>dealing with new media ecology<br>i will mention digital diplomacy by<br>vladimir zelansky<br>to decision opinion makers public and<br>around the world non-stop where in day<br>147<br>and in these days zelinski never stopped<br>talking to the world using zoom using<br>digital tools and this is something new<br>diplomacy supposed to be face to face<br>but a sort of new generation new way of<br>doing things<br>the ariz phenomenon alexey aristovich is<br>as an advisor to the president of<br>ukraine he appears on youtube every day<br>he is doing interview with mark pagan in<br>russian language<br>gathering millions of<br>members of audience every night and this<br>person is a former military a scout he's<br>um a blogger an actor a philosopher and<br>a psychologist we're talking about the<br>new generation of opinion makers very<br>savior with digital tools with<br>incredible appeal we could talk about<br>how ukrainian opinion makers and<br>propagandists are working with the<br>russian opposition media again very<br>innovative ways of doing things and<br>again on digital channels when we could<br>talk even about cartoons uh these are<br>made by russian cartoonists um and um<br>the recent cartoon about masiana a very<br>popular russian simpsons about a woman<br>called masana her family her husband her<br>children um<br>were transposed into a fictional city of<br>saint marienburg<br>said saint petersburg uh attacked<br>allegedly by china and at the end of<br>this cartoon her family dies it's about<br>empathy how people should feel empathy i<br>know i'm running out of time i just<br>wanted to say that we have psychological<br>operations and the year new media<br>ecology offered and specifically<br>ukrainian side if you are interested i<br>can give more<br>examples a lot of tools to diversify um<br>to micro target as well as to make their<br>psychological operations more<br>sophisticated we're talking about stamps<br>about the snake island with a famous<br>middle finger we're talking about<br>um youtube videos we're talking about<br>press conferences with the captives<br>on social media<br>um<br>there are some counter<br>efforts by the russian federation for<br>example the<br>the babushka was the flag the old lady<br>was a flag that was an attempt by the<br>russian federation to provide a<br>psychological operation to counter<br>balance the the post the the stem was<br>the<br>sort of greeting uh the russian navy<br>ship<br>um<br>so that's again potentially for qna and<br>finally my final point is about miss and<br>disinformation we sort of typically see<br>missing disinformation and online tools<br>going together my argument that actually<br>online tools are helping to fight miss<br>in this information not lastly due to<br>through the open source intelligence<br>when citizens are participating in um<br>collecting evidence and providing this<br>evidence to experts who are then<br>piecing it all together using the<br>satellite imagery with the feed of the<br>citizens and then providing very<br>detailed reports online where they<br>debunk um myths and disinformation about<br>this war maybe to answer more questions<br>it's a rich topic but the intersections<br>between new media ecology and<br>information flows during the type of<br>wars deserve much more attention and<br>lots of questions i hope thank you<br>natalia for a really fascinating<br>presentation jim have you got any<br>questions<br>well<br>really just a comment and then maybe a<br>bit of a question but it's really<br>fascinating<br>today by coincidence i suppose i was<br>reading re-reading<br>an opinion piece by a croatian writer<br>from 1993 so i've written in 1993 with<br>wars in yugoslavia and it was called the<br>culture of lies<br>and so that was that pre<br>you know pre-internet period and yet<br>much of the content<br>of<br>what she was describing of the culture<br>of lies and particularly this kind of<br>rewriting of history or using history<br>she had a quote from kundera at the<br>start saying that nobody wants to create<br>the future they want to get empowered in<br>order to write a different past<br>and um so jose is all about this kind of<br>battle about the past and and<br>we can see that again but in as you say<br>in the in a different kind of media<br>environment<br>um and in relation to the past i thought<br>it was very interesting um that kind of<br>relationship to the soviet union which<br>um putin in some ways is quite ambiguous<br>about it was quite critical about the<br>early bolsheviks and creating the<br>nationalities policies which created<br>ukraine and so on but<br>more generally yet that there's that<br>kind of feeding into a nostalgia and so<br>on and almost kind of reviving some<br>values i mean i was really um i suppose<br>um interested but slightly amused by<br>this sort of idea of russian suffering<br>which is a big cliche about russia but i<br>think you're right that it's also<br>something which<br>is there and i think as you say it does<br>tie to the conservative turn because<br>it's about<br>no it's not about kind of um you know<br>individuals getting comfortable ways of<br>life and getting their commodities<br>that's not what life is about so it's<br>tied to this supposed to turn to<br>orthodoxy<br>and<br>it can be very kind of useful i think<br>the irony is that in many ways<br>the suffering that many people in russia<br>would remember is the suffering of the<br>1990s in the economic chaos then which<br>of course led to um<br>led to putin's popularity but he's in<br>danger of kind of throwing it back into<br>him whether he can continue to kind of<br>garner support as he as he does so<br>uh is is questionable um just in terms<br>of that i suppose about the 1990s but<br>also this harking back to the soviet<br>time what um<br>do we see do you think we're seeing in<br>russia different generations having<br>different approaches because of growing<br>up with different media environments and<br>also just being born after the soviet<br>union and so on<br>do you think that that's a fissure<br>that's going to develop or is already<br>there<br>just a very quick comment about the<br>culture of suffering or the this<br>sufferings which actually suggests this<br>particular way of thinking suggests that<br>the sanctions effects will be then<br>interpreted within the narrative of<br>sufferings so if the west imposes suffer<br>imposes sanctions and people live worse<br>again that's one more time to suffer and<br>suffer is<br>is good<br>and so this is something to keep in mind<br>if we're talking about sanctions later<br>um yes interestingly enough that<br>because of the generational change you<br>would expect that certain groups of<br>population be more affected by<br>television for example and less by<br>internet and younger population to be<br>more affected by the new media because<br>nobody cancelled internet and russia<br>people can look for information they can<br>look and ship opinions and look around<br>the world if they don't want to look at<br>ukrainian opinion makers they can look<br>around the world but it's very<br>interesting because as we already know<br>uh certain internet tools in russia are<br>not as working not as we think they<br>should work<br>we know recently was a big publication<br>by meduza in may 2022 and big<br>investigation how youndex rule which is<br>a search engine or for the russian<br>federation was claiming that they're<br>neutral they're not tweaking algorithms<br>everything's working honestly and then<br>it turned out that it actually was<br>tweaked and then they called them toxic<br>asset i think i'm not wrong<br>but um<br>where i see the generational conflict is<br>actually not in russia but actually<br>between russia and ukraine and if we<br>look at the age of putin and his<br>ministers and people who are in power<br>these are people in their 60s and 70s<br>who who had to survive in the 90s and<br>potentially compromise in order to be<br>successful certain norms and values<br>while if you look at the ukrainian<br>leadership as well as opinion makers<br>they're all in their mid-40s and this is<br>sort of i think there is a generational<br>conflict<br>between these two leadership styles<br>because this<br>leadership style in ukraine is like<br>internet it's more networked it's more<br>connected it's about the system where<br>everybody sort of depends on each other<br>um yeah so that's my answer to the<br>question about generation<br>thank you natalia i've got a question as<br>well but i will maybe we can discuss it<br>later because we're beginning to get<br>questions in from the audience and i<br>think it would be great to involve the<br>audience now the first question we've<br>got<br>for our panel how do you think this war<br>might play out and what actions would<br>you recommend to be taken to accelerate<br>this i ask this as the human cost is so<br>great and rising<br>jim any thoughts on this<br>um<br>i mean i said in my introductory remarks<br>that it's very difficult to see a way<br>out that that was what was so shocking<br>about it i mean there are different<br>long-term scenarios that we could um<br>envisage i mean initially i suppose<br>putin expected a quick kind of victory<br>over ukraine although what that would<br>have meant i don't know but we can<br>maybe imagine that ultimately<br>ukrainian forces will drive russia<br>russian forces out of ukraine or<br>i think it's less likely now that russia<br>will take control of all of ukraine but<br>may continue to expand uh across the<br>rest of donbass<br>and also across the southern coast<br>um perhaps the most likely<br>um scenario<br>is a sort of long drawn-out thing with<br>skirmishes where there is some sort of<br>consolidation of these front lines<br>and very hard to see how<br>russia can be driven out once it has<br>consolidated i saw today zielinski say<br>affiliate for more weapons um partly<br>because he's saying that needs to be<br>before winter because that will give<br>russia a chance to consolidate<br>um<br>that's the kind of military uh uh<br>scenario whether there's i i still see<br>very little room again putin today was<br>um claiming that there was this peace<br>deal sort of almost on the table in<br>march and they were nearly agreed on and<br>blaming ukraine for backing down on it<br>but i just can't envisage what that<br>could have been i can't see how the<br>ukrainian authorities could<br>um allow anything that seemed to<br>reward russian aggression or in fact<br>the powers outside and i couldn't see<br>any way that putin could kind of back<br>down in a way that was necessary to get<br>ukrainian agreement in a way that would<br>be acceptable for him politically and i<br>think that still remains the case<br>it then raises the question should<br>outside powers try and push them towards<br>some sort of compromise but<br>i don't think that's necessarily<br>something that<br>should be done because as i say i don't<br>see any compromise<br>possible which doesn't in some way<br>reward rational aggression<br>yes i agree jim and it's interesting<br>mr medvedev said that the<br>settlement had to be on russia's terms<br>if there was going to be a settlement<br>which seems quite assertive thing to say<br>do you have any thoughts on this natalia<br>about how<br>this conflict can be<br>if you like played out and<br>resolved as quickly as possible<br>i think i will support jim's some<br>argument about the fact that external<br>it's a dangerous pres<br>dangerous development of external forces<br>of pushing<br>the two sides towards agreement and<br>especially because we have a precedent<br>of minsk agreements and these means<br>agreements<br>agreements were short-term solutions<br>which sort of led to less shooting but<br>didn't really solve the long-term deeper<br>problems and that led to what we have in<br>2022<br>so there is um<br>i think a strong thinking that<br>freezing the conflict as it is now on<br>the budgets of 24th of february or<br>current buddhists where the occupied<br>territories are sitting is not going to<br>solve the problem long term<br>the of course the saddest development is<br>the fact that the advancement of<br>ukrainian troops was hymers and other<br>weapons now in ukraine and they are as<br>we know<br>demolishing the the weapon the the<br>warehouses where the weapons are kept<br>the the reply from that is shooting at<br>the cities the shooting at the civilians<br>and um<br>that is is the saddest development the<br>fact that um we are observing<br>casualties in new plots of ukraine was<br>more civilians dying including children<br>and um<br>yeah at this at this point i don't think<br>ukraine will looking at what is going on<br>and what sort of sacrifices are made<br>that ukraine will say yep fine let's sit<br>down and let's agree and sign something<br>so i don't see a short-term solution at<br>the moment<br>i agree with you comments natalia that<br>there's been some pressure from<br>commentators and scholars in um a number<br>of western countries there should be a<br>sort of land for peace deal<br>uh whereby russia was allowed allowed to<br>um if you like retain some of the<br>territory it's annexed but i think jim's<br>made this very clear that may be seen as<br>a reward for regression and the problem<br>with that deal is that<br>it may not stick it would not be<br>acceptable to most people in ukraine um<br>and it also um what happens if mr putin<br>restarts hostilities six months after<br>the deal so it seems to me full of<br>practical problems then<br>what would be your assessment on the<br>sort of american position<br>at the moment<br>well the american position um of course<br>it's brought to the domestic politics i<br>mean mr mr biden is not getting a lot of<br>credit<br>for supporting um the ukrainian<br>government of celenski but i still think<br>the biden approach<br>um<br>all things considered<br>is probably appropriate and it's a<br>steadily escalation of support for the<br>ukrainian government after all the<br>ukrainian government and its army have<br>proved themselves<br>against what was considered a very<br>formidable fighting force and i think<br>many people were surprised how well the<br>ukrainian army has performed and natalya<br>just mentioned these um these this new<br>heavy weaponry arriving the himas for<br>example these um<br>these high mobility artillery rocket<br>systems they are beginning to have quite<br>a impact and the other thing is that<br>much of the discussion about the war is<br>based in the west and in russia to some<br>degree on the assumptions is going to be<br>a long war<br>but russia's economy is under strain yes<br>his oil prices<br>have certainly gone up and it's done<br>nicely in terms of hard currency from<br>that but<br>um those sanctions are still biting 500<br>companies have left russia and it's it's<br>overall economy is smaller than italy so<br>i'm not sure how long mr putin's got to<br>fight this war so i still think there is<br>the potential for this<br>there's going to be a counter-offensive<br>by ukraine we don't know when but the<br>situation is more fluid and i think that<br>it probably seems at the moment we'll<br>just have to watch this space now we've<br>got several other questions<br>um<br>hello from slovakia do you think there's<br>any possibility of other post-soviet<br>countries being attacked by the russian<br>army even the ones that are nato members<br>maybe i could start the future or maybe<br>well let's go with natalie you're right<br>let's let's reverse the order<br>natalia<br>well<br>um i think at this particular point<br>starting aggression against a nato<br>member is not a realistic scenario for<br>the russian federation we know that at<br>the moment we have an operational pause<br>because it's not enough<br>rockets and the weapons to to shoot due<br>to the destruction of the warehouses<br>but we also know that on his trip to<br>iran president putin was asking his<br>counterpart and iran to provide was<br>provide the russian army was the drones<br>so<br>um<br>it is a risky um development for the<br>russian army uh to study any aggression<br>against any nato state big or small i<br>don't think the russian army at the<br>moment has any<br>yeah enough capacities and capabilities<br>to sustain a conflict of that magnitude<br>having said that<br>um<br>i think all countries specifically<br>closer to the russian border need to be<br>vigilant and careful and we see examples<br>of sweden and finland<br>getting into nato after decades of being<br>neutral<br>this development suggests that they take<br>um the situation in the region very<br>seriously<br>jim i mean i i'd agree i mean i think<br>the the army's the russian army has been<br>so hit and they're so overstretched that<br>it would just be inconceivable at the<br>moment um<br>that you know there has been talk about<br>maybe trying to link up to and<br>especially the expanded west on the<br>black sea coast to to moldova to<br>transition<br>or maybe kind of stirring things up in<br>um republic of serbs in this have been<br>part of bosnia for example but i i don't<br>see either of them has been feasible at<br>the moment or or being likely at least<br>by the main russian military there may<br>be mercenaries or whatever who might be<br>kind of encouraged to stir things up<br>but again it comes back i think to the<br>longer term question of kind of<br>rewarding anything that's seen as<br>rewarding russian aggression i think<br>most<br>governments in in the neighboring states<br>including the nato members<br>uh are well aware that um of the dangers<br>of anything which might seem to reward<br>putin's aggression and therefore kind of<br>give a green light to future aggression<br>i was reading a very interesting piece<br>today which was kind of comparing with<br>the unwritten rules of the cold war<br>and between the soviets and and<br>the united states and saying that in a<br>sense it's stabilized to certain<br>unwritten rules again this time<br>including i mean some of them have been<br>made expressed including by president<br>biden that uh<br>um<br>the u.s and nato will train ukrainian<br>troops will supply weapons but will not<br>fight on the ground in ukraine<br>and i think putin realizes also that if<br>uh russia was to invade certainly a nato<br>member state that article five would be<br>activated and and it would be suicidal<br>so there are those sort of<br>unwritten rules the article was more<br>about whether it might kind of<br>something might happen<br>almost by accident or you know out of<br>putin's control but i don't think there<br>would be a sort of um planned invasion<br>of<br>estonia or even<br>a state like moldova at the moment i<br>think some of mr putin's supporters in<br>moscow like to raise the specter many of<br>them have of attacking nato<br>um even some even directly threatened<br>the united states recently but i think<br>this is bluff<br>and i i think the other point that jim's<br>raised though is a really important one<br>that russia may in trying to accept<br>um they haven't made much effort in this<br>effort so far but in accepting the uh<br>trying to intercept some of the infusion<br>of arms uh from the western countries<br>you know war is an imprecise business<br>they may try to be confined the<br>operation to ukraine but if a russian<br>missile a stray russian missile went<br>into a nato country that could cause<br>uh some potential difficulty so we can<br>you know we can't say<br>definitively the war won't spread but um<br>if putin retains tight political control<br>of his military then it seems unlikely<br>now we've got another question here it<br>is the question is as follows it is now<br>plainly visible that our global<br>distribution of all system of all<br>products materials and resources is<br>extremely fragile and that we're the end<br>of cheap fossil fuel energy<br>how will new zealand respond<br>to this reality<br>now<br>uh<br>natalia could i ask you to respond to<br>that it's quite a long question but it's<br>an interesting one<br>um<br>about the you know the the frailties of<br>an interconnected but as we've seen<br>during this war a potentially vulnerable<br>yes um and um this is probably one of<br>the arguments why this war is not a<br>faraway war in the far away part of<br>europe with no relation to new zealand<br>when<br>um<br>the when the crimean peninsula was<br>annexed in 2014 there was an outcry<br>around the world but very very quickly<br>the the news have has disappeared from<br>the the the top of the charts and um<br>people stopped talking about the crimea<br>people stopped talking about<br>uh the war in the bus it was one of the<br>forgotten wars to europe so at the<br>moment we're also observing something<br>similar in new zealand we do we do know<br>that western audiences they have little<br>patience for long and costly wars<br>and um<br>boy in ukraine was such a big news in<br>the beginning and all new zealand news<br>outlets online traditional media and at<br>the moment it's no longer it's still<br>there but it's not the front news look<br>at the guardian<br>the news about ukraine go down down down<br>but i'm just back from europe and i've<br>been to italy and to germany and to<br>sweden in denmark ukraine is been<br>concerned number one on people's minds<br>and not not not only because of<br>aggression and threat and danger but<br>specifically because<br>prices went up on gas the food is<br>getting more expensive the same in the<br>united states so suddenly people learned<br>that apparently ukraine provided grain<br>for the rest of the world suddenly<br>leaders from southeast asia are coming<br>to ukraine to talk to ukrainian<br>president because they are concerned<br>their people will starve if the war will<br>continue so it's not only about new<br>zealand the war is affecting the whole<br>globe and we know about possible hunger<br>we'll know about possible um<br>rising prices on fuel and um this is a<br>changing picture of the world and new<br>zealand will be affected just because it<br>is in the region and the region might<br>have problems with food and because new<br>zealand needs to ride the cars<br>it diff this the whole situation for<br>example in germany<br>now<br>um<br>sort of drives the the the much more<br>serious debate about how to move towards<br>the new ways of energy supplies<br>sustainable energy we all talked about<br>it in the light of the climate change<br>but you know it is what it is people<br>sometimes are slow in action and<br>suddenly it is into people's faces so i<br>think um in a strange way uh we will<br>have to start answering difficult<br>questions faster and because of the war<br>yeah i mean i totally agree with that<br>and um<br>and of course coming on the<br>on the heels of and and still developing<br>covet um crisis that we have a very<br>similar sort of issue so it's hard to<br>disentangle them but both of them kind<br>of<br>show<br>the<br>interconnectedness but also the<br>vulnerability that goes with that at the<br>supply chain so i think there is some<br>realization<br>of that in the new zealand side and a<br>wider kind of<br>realization about particularly<br>relations with china and economic<br>interrelations with it and<br>also recently back from europe and it<br>was interesting in germany where we had<br>discussions with students about<br>germany's policy of reliance on uh<br>gas imports from from russia<br>and i said<br>well um chancellor merkel was not<br>a putin fan she wasn't pro-russian so<br>how did she allow this to happen and it<br>was partly because germany benefited<br>economically in that time but their<br>argument was this kind of belief in<br>interdependence of trade bringing peace<br>and this seems to have blown that apart<br>and<br>they're kind of realizing and turning<br>against that um and i think that also<br>applies i mean this is turning a bit<br>more<br>away from the kind of economic side but<br>the geopolitical side about<br>um<br>new zealand's kind of<br>engagement in the global economy and<br>whether that creates vulnerabilities um<br>with russia but also i think in the<br>longer term with china but just that<br>point about climate change yes there is<br>potentially the positive aspect of this<br>that european countries in particular<br>may have to act more quickly<br>in the short term though countries like<br>germany are going back to coal and<br>poland is kind of saying look we're all<br>right we're burning coal which of course<br>is a very bad thing you know i i think<br>the question that we have we've had from<br>the audience is a really good one<br>because i think the ukraine crisis<br>highlights the gap between the the<br>reality of inter con interconnectedness<br>in the world we live both in in economic<br>and trade terms but the fact that we do<br>not have authoritative international<br>institutions to oversee rules and i<br>think one of the biggest victims of the<br>ukraine crisis has been the u.n security<br>council and one of the interesting<br>things is that<br>new zealand has alluded to the fact that<br>president zielinski said that when this<br>conflict conflict is over he's going to<br>dedicate himself<br>to reforming the veto system within the<br>u.n and that is something of course<br>that's been a long-term goal of new<br>zealand foreign policy so i think there<br>is a sense this crisis has highlighted<br>it's all very well talking about a<br>rules-based order but you do need<br>institutions to actually uphold the<br>rules and and so you know that is<br>something uh that we<br>we probably need to look at in light of<br>this crisis now we have one more<br>question but we only have two minutes<br>left so there'll be a quick response i'm<br>afraid the question is as follows what<br>do you think about the hypothesis that<br>the war in ukraine will only be stopped<br>if there is pressure on russian<br>authorities from its citizens is there<br>any realistic component to this<br>expectation i'll go quickly to natalia<br>and then quickly to jim<br>as i mentioned in my presentation at the<br>moment we are sort of a little bit<br>puzzled<br>by um not enough of public pressure on<br>the authorities in russia but having<br>said that there are lots of critical<br>thinking people in russia and there are<br>a lot of smart people in russia and i<br>think<br>um that public pressure will will come<br>to fruition maybe a little bit later<br>and um<br>we're too interconnected to continue<br>like this following on the previous<br>sentiment<br>thank you natalia jim and natalia's<br>point about suffering may in the short<br>term kind of lead people to support the<br>regime i think in the long term<br>potentially there will be a shift away<br>from it so i think<br>one of the goals of the sanctions is to<br>achieve that and i think that's probably<br>uh<br>right um<br>i think though the more realistic change<br>has to come from<br>the top from within the elites<br>within um say the military or whatever<br>you sort of see this as as uh not really<br>being in russian interest and not in the<br>interests of the army necessarily<br>yes mr putin must be vulnerable to those<br>groups who have traditionally<br>supported his government because after<br>all his whole rationale for going into<br>ukraine<br>was to strengthen russia's security<br>situation yet he's seen sweden and<br>finland now apply to join nato which is<br>precisely the scenario he didn't want so<br>unfortunately we can't take any more<br>questions because we are rapidly running<br>out of time but it just remains for me<br>to thank natalia and jim for i think as<br>you would agree giving us tremendous<br>insights in this uh crisis in ukraine<br>which has big ramifications and has also<br>been pointed out big consequences for<br>new zealand we may be geographically a<br>long way away but we are certainly<br>feeling its effects and likely to in the<br>future as well so thank you very much<br>for listening and please keep in mind<br>that we have a another winter symposium<br>event next week on the 27th of july</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
