it's 9 31 i can see our number<br>of attendees and coming in and joining<br>us um so welcome<br>to today's webinar on the future of<br>spiritual and religious tourism hosted<br>from victoria university of wellington<br>in new zealand<br>very excited and you can join us today<br>let me quickly make sure i'm not<br>forgetting anything important to tell<br>you here there we go so my name is ina<br>raikenberger i'm a senior lecturer here<br>at victoria university of wellington my<br>specialty is in tourist behavior i have<br>nothing to do with them spiritual or<br>religious tourism whatsoever in the<br>slightest so i'm really really excited<br>today to hear from the speakers we've<br>invited to get some insight into<br>how religious tourism pilgrimage<br>spirituality will play a role in tourism<br>moving forward post and covet 19.<br>we are welcoming two excellent um<br>contributors and speakers today we have<br>um dr kevin griffin here he is a senior<br>lecturer in tourism at the technical<br>university in dublin kevin's an expert<br>really in religious tourism amongst many<br>many other things on his cv he's the<br>editor-in-chief of the international<br>journal of religious tourism and<br>pilgrimage he's also editing a book<br>series with cabbie on religious tourism<br>and pilgrimage and he's going to share<br>with us his thoughts on how pilgrimages<br>especially are perhaps going to develop<br>moving forward especially now that<br>through kobit 19 we've all been<br>connected digitally and virtually a lot<br>more as our second speaker i'm<br>absolutely delighted to welcome dr jay<br>on joe and shea is joining us from<br>swansea university in the uk<br>she's electro in tourism and she too is<br>an expert in religious and especially<br>spiritual and wellness tourism<br>um jaeon is on the editorial board of<br>kevin's aforementioned journal of<br>religious tourism and pilgrimage and<br>shae's been doing a lot of work around<br>especially the role of spirituality and<br>is going to share with us today her<br>thoughts on spirituality in a place<br>covered tourism world<br>we were also hoping to welcome dr sarah<br>ramani from victoria university of<br>wellington today to contribute a<br>perspective on the future role of<br>meditation and tourism sarah<br>unfortunately is unable to join us today<br>i'm very sorry to miss her contribution<br>to this webinar um<br>does leave a little bit more time for us<br>of course and to discuss and kevin and<br>jaion's contribution through the q a<br>version<br>um our attendees and thank you so much<br>for joining us you're probably quite<br>familiar with the setup and the<br>structure of azu webinar by now i think<br>we've all spent enough time in these<br>settings and please contribute your<br>questions through the q a button at the<br>bottom of your screen you'll also be<br>able to see the questions contributed by<br>other participants of the webinar and<br>are able to upload these if you find<br>them especially interesting and we'll<br>come through the q a section after our<br>speakers have completed the presentation<br>and essentially we're going to work our<br>way down from the top um amongst the<br>most popular questions moving there<br>and we'll hopefully have a sufficient<br>time today to really start um a good<br>discussion around this topic that<br>is really going to be probably<br>increasingly relevant and in the future<br>of tourism<br>so thank you very much for joining us<br>today<br>oh there was a slide with a picture of<br>me hi that's me<br>um we're going to kick it off straight<br>away and with um dr kevin griffin's<br>contribution on the 22nd century<br>pilgrimage with a question mark kevin<br>thank you so much for joining us and<br>i'll hand it over to you<br>thank you um<br>hope everyone's going to hear me okay<br>all the way from ireland to new zealand<br>which is what a phenomenal concept<br>um<br>it's obviously it's late at night here<br>as it is for for jay on as well so uh<br>forgive me if i'm a bit a little bit<br>scattered it's been a very long day<br>including a talent show in the local<br>school my son was performing in so a bit<br>of a bit of anxiety getting here on time<br>to do i was hoping definition time which<br>they did<br>um<br>so i think perhaps on this title slide<br>the most important thing is the question<br>mark<br>um<br>you know what is 22nd century anything<br>um<br>one of my neighbors tells a really<br>interesting fact<br>his son has started a job as a game<br>designer<br>an online game designer very very very<br>brilliant young man that job didn't<br>exist when his father got his first job<br>the father was a kind of a developmental<br>engineer that job didn't exist when his<br>father got his first job<br>and his father was a car mechanic and<br>that job didn't exist when his<br>grandfather got his first job so you<br>know that to me tells me how the world<br>changes you know the generation after<br>generation are doing things that have<br>never been done before and never seen<br>before so when we talk to something talk<br>about something as kind of strange and<br>unusual as uh pilgrimage if you can go<br>on um i can i take control of the slides<br>so next slide thank you um so what is<br>pilgrimage i have a slide here which<br>kind of<br>you know it's difficult in<br>the length of time we have to cover<br>anything in a huge amount of detail but<br>um what i want to talk about is the very<br>broad breadth of religious tourism and<br>pilgrimage i'm using the word pilgrimage<br>but just as a a a at just one of the<br>terms you get spiritual tourism church<br>tourism religious tourism and there are<br>subtle differences and i'm terrified<br>with kieran shinde and daniel olsen<br>logged down here with to get bogged down<br>in definitions we could be here for<br>hours um between a bunch of us<br>but what i'm just trying to get people<br>to think about is the broad sense of as<br>the very um paraphrase quote at the<br>bottom says a form of tourism driven by<br>a given faith or set of beliefs and<br>whether that is<br>you know i don't go in as far as secular<br>tourism and visits to elvis presley's<br>grave and things like that but you know<br>we'll stick with more church and<br>religious focused uh elements of it<br>these have been motivating driving<br>people to travel for thousands of years<br>um you know we've monuments in ireland<br>which are older than the pyramids uh<br>newgrange which is a megalithic tomb and<br>people<br>you know as much as we can figure out<br>what happened they were traveling there<br>for religious reasons to celebrate uh<br>the winter solstice um<br>and you know the starting of a new year<br>and you know people have been traveling<br>these days some people suggest perhaps<br>the being beginnings of civilization are<br>religious based where people gathered in<br>groups to do certain things<br>of a religious nature<br>right the way up then to modern um you<br>know<br>leisure activity with a religious focus<br>which i i don't have on this left-hand<br>side this slide one that fascinates me<br>is cruises to do with religion you know<br>cruising around the mediterranean to<br>visit all the ancient christian sites<br>and if you think about the map of the<br>mediterranean all the the the<br>the fundamental foundational locations<br>to do with the bible are located around<br>the mediterranean do it on a cruise you<br>get to visit the sites say some prayers<br>attend some services<br>and have a historical tour all in one so<br>you know religious tourism pilgrimage<br>traveling for religious purposes<br>is you know a global phenomenon and all<br>the way from all different types from<br>the accident the general tourist who<br>walks into a cathedral to the person at<br>the other end of the scale here on the<br>right hand side the fervent<br>religious tourist or pilgrim who is<br>traveling specifically for a religious<br>purpose um if we can go onto the next<br>slide<br>um<br>so<br>you know tourism we're talking about<br>pilgrimage religious tourism<br>the world tourism organization has<br>recognized the importance of religious<br>tourism and has held a number of<br>national international global<br>conferences webinar seminars<br>so they're enthusiastic about religious<br>tourism but as i put in brackets there<br>what about statistics and again i know<br>some people who've logged on um are very<br>aware of this wonderful statistic<br>we hear<br>so if you listen to this for a second<br>there are 300 million international<br>pilgrims or religious tourists every<br>year<br>and this number is rapidly growing that<br>is repeated and has been repeated for<br>the past the last 15 to 20 years<br>no one has updated that 300 million no<br>one has updated the doubling of that to<br>600 million if you include domestic<br>pilgrimage in religious travel<br>um<br>so it drives us crazy and at a world<br>tourism organization event i i cornered<br>the person who first put that in print<br>by the world tourism organization i said<br>where did that come from and i was told<br>where it came from um<br>kevin wright in america came up with the<br>number<br>i've asked kevin right where to get the<br>number and he says it's a guesstimate<br>so you know we it<br>it kind of frustrates me so this is my<br>kind of foundation what i'm trying to<br>say here which is<br>this is an enormous activity<br>it's global with events with 10 20 40 60<br>million people traveling to them<br>but we still haven't quantified it<br>properly so that that's one of the<br>weaknesses um if we go to the next slide<br>perhaps<br>so<br>when we look to to the where we're at<br>where is tourism where is travel at at<br>the moment gosh we all hope that it's<br>starting to come out of of cove in in<br>western europe we're doing quite well<br>we've got out of covert i went to spain<br>a couple of weeks ago with my children<br>we traveled we wore masks on the<br>airplane we came back we all got their<br>hit there and back safe so<br>david edgel's<br>important world tourism issues for 2021<br>covet was very core to that and it still<br>is and it will be<br>other issues there i think if you go<br>through them if i<br>three hours to do it i could go through<br>that step by step and tell you where i<br>think religious tourism fits i think it<br>fits in almost every one of those it has<br>an in it's influenced by or it<br>influences<br>almost all of these issues<br>i found this really interesting list<br>here by conde nest which is their what<br>they think the future holds you know and<br>i'm not a futurist but uh i understand<br>what you do you talk to experts you see<br>you you get the views of experts and you<br>can do all sorts of data collection and<br>analysis but one of the ways is to look<br>at these um you know world experts<br>somewhere like hand nest and they say<br>you know these are the 10 steps or the<br>10 future trends and again<br>i think really just tourism and<br>pilgrimage fit really well into this um<br>the idea of the the rebooting of<br>long-haul travel you know people going<br>on pilgrimage you know muslims from all<br>over the world going to mecca um<br>personal development retreats you know<br>the the travel of people particularly to<br>india for for meditation and yoga um i'm<br>sure jayan will touch on that a little<br>bit extreme expeditions i'm not so sure<br>about that but some of the pilgrimages<br>i've read about and researched about are<br>pretty extreme you know 30 days of<br>walking with the backpack on your back<br>when you're you know and people doing it<br>who have never done the third trip<br>before so maybe not extreme in in the<br>true sense word all-inclusive luxury is<br>interesting because a lot of pilgrimage<br>travel<br>has tagged on an inclusive luxury piece<br>as well so people uh my own parents did<br>a pilgrimage to italy many a good few<br>years ago now and they went for four or<br>five days they traipse around italy to<br>see where padre pio had been now saint<br>pio<br>and then they had five days on the<br>amalfi coast where they discovered uh<br>this beautiful drink<br>um which they brought home and uh yeah<br>the<br>sambuca<br>they discovered on their their first<br>trip easily on their pilgrimage but in a<br>beautiful hotel so this idea of<br>balancing pilgrimage with luxury i'm not<br>sure about the cosmonaut training camps<br>i don't know how that fits with<br>pilgrimage hallucinogenic healing i'm<br>going to skip but the idea of healing<br>using alternative methods i didn't<br>believe that was in it actually until i<br>came across it<br>um and the workstations of going places<br>adventure hiking very clued in or<br>linkedin i think with pilgrimage a lot<br>of<br>destinations worldwide are developing<br>pilgrimage trails hiking related and<br>then streamer locations basically people<br>going to places where they stream from<br>that's my understanding of that one<br>so lots of things happening in tourism<br>that i think pilgrimage fits in with i'm<br>just going to stop on the next slide<br>very briefly<br>just to point out that the sustainable<br>development goals three of which are<br>specifically tourism related so<br>inclusive sustainable economic growth<br>sustainable consumption production<br>sustained the use of oceans and maritime<br>resources<br>the first two of those definitely there<br>are pilgrimage implications there where<br>you know sites historic sites heritage<br>sites<br>linked to religion<br>and their long-term sustainability are<br>huge of huge interest and quite a lot of<br>pilgrimage sites it's because<br>their heritage is being protected<br>because they're ongoing pilgrimage sites<br>and then the consumption and production<br>we could get into discussion on you know<br>what are the the factors and features<br>of sustainable consumption production<br>producing locally consumed locally and<br>local pilgrimage sites i think fulfill<br>that quite well<br>the next slide then um<br>i just have this question which i'm<br>throwing out about covert to people to<br>think about you know a lot of the<br>literature on kovad and our the impact<br>it had and how we're recovering from it<br>are monetary focused and<br>materialistically focused<br>um the emphasis is on the short terms<br>and the economic downturn the long term<br>is on developing delivering safe<br>procedures for future possible events<br>um so the time energy resource has been<br>spent on avoiding detecting monitoring<br>and managing covert<br>but there's been very little<br>literature research<br>focus on<br>you know the role of the personal<br>human impact despite the fact that<br>that's something we've all dwelt on as<br>individuals how has cove it affected me<br>and my family and my my how i look at<br>the world so i think that's something<br>maybe on the 22nd century but in the in<br>the near future people are looking at<br>this um i was talking to a priest<br>recently who was looking at how the<br>church has evolved his particular<br>congregation where people are now still<br>staying online who are comfortable with<br>it um and older people in particular who<br>who would have you know had found it<br>difficult to get to a weekly service or<br>weekly mass are now quite happy to be<br>online on their iphones um<br>that kind of personal spiritual idea<br>so if you don't mind the next slide<br>um<br>one of the really interesting<br>developments there's lots of different<br>examples of this is how<br>sites all over the world of a pilgrimage<br>religious tourism nature have used<br>virtual technology to engage with<br>followers so you can get a prayer said<br>at the the western wall in jerusalem if<br>you send an email and a donation to this<br>organization top right is a temple in in<br>india where you can 24 hours a day watch<br>prayer services<br>uh knock catholic shrine nerd i had to<br>throw that one in you can watch live<br>services and recordings and the great<br>mosque can make it there's multiple you<br>know online systems where you can watch<br>it live you can watch recordings you can<br>tune in for for daily prayers<br>um and these are sites there's a new<br>tiny selection of the ones all over the<br>world who've discovered<br>the value of technology for for engaging<br>with pilgrims um<br>and again that brings the theory of kind<br>of theoretical ideas of what is a<br>pilgrimage do you physically have to<br>travel there are religions where you<br>know traveling for pilgrimage is seen as<br>being unnecessary because the travel<br>haven't happens internally<br>and a lot of religious sites over over a<br>cove that have thought about that and i<br>think this is something particularly for<br>the future and then the next slide which<br>is my last one i'm kind of galloping<br>through but if we can every time we may<br>travel back to some of these ideas<br>so what i've been thinking about is you<br>know what is the role of proxy or<br>virtual pilgrimage and it goes right the<br>way back there's no evidence for<br>something like the fourth century but in<br>the 15th century it was guidebooks<br>written about pilgrimages to the holy<br>land and the purpose of writing them was<br>so the people could live through these<br>books live the pilgrimage that they<br>could never go on themselves<br>you know and you'd give up your life for<br>years to get to jerusalem from from<br>england for example you know you the<br>travel the danger the cost all this kind<br>of thing um and there were actually<br>professional pilgrims you could hire<br>someone to do the pilgrimage for you<br>what a cool concept um which reminds me<br>of being at a religious tourism event in<br>um in portugal and seeing somebody walk<br>into<br>um the cathedral<br>with a camera walking around the place<br>and i was thinking how rude is that<br>until i realized they were talking to<br>somebody who was somewhere else in the<br>world and they were showing them the<br>religious site um so you know i was<br>thinking how rude how awful you know<br>they're going back to something that's<br>been happening for centuries so on the<br>right here then you know<br>when we're talking about things like<br>overcrowding and you know<br>over consumption and all these sorts of<br>problems is there an actual role i love<br>these guys on the top right here in the<br>cinema or something using their their<br>their head headsets and then yeah this<br>they're not wearing earphones and this<br>one i use different photographs where<br>their earphones in and you've all these<br>immersive technologies you know are we<br>going to see a future where this is an<br>alternative as opposed to going to<br>places for those capacity issues you<br>know mecca is now a four<br>around four million people and you know<br>there's a lot of concern over pollution<br>over<br>stress of the environment what's going<br>to happen if oil prices continue to<br>shoot up and it's not affordable for<br>anyone to travel anywhere um are we<br>going to resort to this earning or the<br>the bottom one there this kind of<br>virtual environment and how that's going<br>to step forward<br>so you know moving back to what i said<br>at the beginning you know this idea of<br>you know we don't know the current<br>generation what we're doing<br>wasn't envisaged a generation ago so<br>what's the future going to be what i am<br>fairly certain of though is this fine<br>little box here and on the bottom right<br>and that is that there is something in<br>pilgrimage<br>um<br>the religious adherents want to engage<br>in some sort of physical interaction a<br>huge amount is what the turner's called<br>communitas which is this idea of a<br>community engaging in an activity and<br>that's part of the religious experience<br>part of the pilgrimage experience<br>and whether you're<br>you know talking about yoga or you're<br>talking about you know<br>circum<br>navigating the the the holy sites<br>all over the world but i'm thinking<br>particularly in mecca you know in in<br>large numbers there there's a value and<br>an importance which people put in in<br>pilgrimage of being with other people so<br>i said i see technology playing a part<br>but i don't see it replacing it entirely<br>and then<br>the other final comment i'd say i think<br>is that perhaps there'll be and i use<br>the term and it was edited out by an<br>editor once upon a time on me where i<br>use the word localization i don't know<br>if you're familiar with that folks but<br>the idea of being global and local at<br>once which sounds completely<br>contradictory but you know i want to<br>travel to this globally important place<br>but i also want to to support the local<br>at the same time<br>so i think that's the the future<br>so i'll stop at that i don't know if we<br>want questions and chat now or will we<br>wait to the end ina<br>um<br>we've got a little bit more flexibility<br>around the time so first of all kevin<br>thank you very much um for this<br>presentation it's been really<br>fascinating to him consider some of the<br>components involved especially in the<br>pilgrimage campaign end of religious<br>tourism i think and daniel olsen posted<br>a question in the q a that i think might<br>be helpful to answer now before we move<br>on to uh jayon's contribution today<br>and he says kevin you gave a demand side<br>definition of religious tourism<br>motivated by religion and what would a<br>supply-side definition perhaps look like<br>or also does it make sense to create a<br>supply-side definition in this context<br>yeah well there definitely is one um<br>you know<br>i'm thinking<br>particularly older church sides<br>physics you know physical heritage<br>um needs to be maintained and if you've<br>got you know<br>canterbury cathedral and you've got to<br>keep it functioning it's very useful if<br>you can get pilgrims to turn up and pay<br>a little bit of money each um to support<br>it um<br>mecca is is whether it's supplier demand<br>i'm not quite sure but the amount of<br>development of growth around the central<br>mosque is enormous<br>in recent decades and the same you know<br>some of the the religious sites in india<br>are just expanding exponentially to to<br>cater for the millions of people who are<br>traveling<br>um i i'm i'm not going to do too much<br>marketing but i've just recently been<br>proof reading a paper about a a<br>a church in africa which is if i<br>remember right three kilometers by three<br>kilometers in size<br>um that's definitely supply side<br>creating a<br>you know an enormous super charge um<br>is that supplier demand you know<br>demand follow supply follows demand it's<br>a bit of both<br>um<br>how do we get you into kieran chin to<br>just us and how do we get the the world<br>tourism organization to provide data<br>if when you have the person who wrote<br>the report that everyone called standing<br>in front of you and he says well you<br>know we used his one have you heard of<br>kevin kevin wright and i said yeah he<br>wasn't expecting the answer yeah i've<br>emailed him i've talked to him he he<br>made it up<br>you know and that's effectively where<br>that number came and you know i know<br>daniel and karen are both tired of<br>seeing that statistic quoted again and<br>again we all quote it because it's the<br>unequipment it's the only you know we're<br>academics we have to defend our court um<br>i've gone off and done lots and you know<br>trying to dig into that but it's it's a<br>colossal task to try and go country by<br>country to see<br>you know can we identify who's traveling<br>italy and<br>israel i think are the only two<br>um<br>states that<br>did statistically record religious<br>travel<br>um<br>yeah i think they're the only two from<br>memory serves me right so yeah that's<br>when they do that i i i'll be delighted<br>give us a statistic it gives a fact with<br>regard to my son's contribution yeah he<br>that was laying on me thank you kevin<br>i'm<br>so glad i know this now<br>all right um we've got a few more<br>questions and coming in but for now<br>we're going to move on to um our second<br>speaker today so mgm thank you so much<br>for joining us from the uk where it's<br>also late i'm glad you've had coffee i<br>hope it's not going to interfere too<br>badly if you sleep tonight but you're<br>expanding or rather taking and kevin's<br>contribution in a different direction<br>and you're looking not so much at<br>religion and pilgrimage but at<br>spirituality and tourism so thank you<br>very much for joining us today and i'll<br>hand over to you<br>thank you ina thanks so much for uh the<br>invitation to to ian as well and kevin<br>good to see you and it was very<br>interesting to um hear your presentation<br>i agree with uh a lot of the things that<br>you mentioned especially i'm working on<br>pierre me's uh project in wales now<br>but anyways hello everyone i'm jayan<br>i'm working at swansea university in uk<br>and yeah it's becoming 11 p.m here it's<br>it's my bedtime but i had a really<br>really strong um three cups of coffee<br>now so i i try to be uh i hope i try to<br>be um<br>entertaining speaker as usual<br>anyways i'm speaking about inclusive and<br>social spiritual tourism features um in<br>southeast asia<br>and i've been researching on spiritual<br>tourism<br>and<br>a little bit of religious tourism as<br>well subject in the past 10 years<br>and um i had a very interesting<br>experience in 2016 in chiang mai<br>thailand during my field work<br>i was investigating how spiritual<br>tourism is beneficial for tourists in<br>chiang mai<br>so i was uh talking to people uh who are<br>there for spiritual practices and<br>spiritual tourism and i noticed that<br>everyone i was talking to was actually<br>was some person from western europe and<br>u.s and australia<br>and also these spiritual facilities and<br>yoga studios and mind blitz rates that i<br>was going to are also<br>ran by western teachers and western<br>owners western managers so i was<br>wondering um<br>where are the thai people<br>and so when i went for the next project<br>to ubud bali i was investigating more on<br>how to spiritual tourism actually impact<br>on local people and community of course<br>in theory like kevin mentioned earlier<br>spiritual tourism religious tourism all<br>this kind of you know positive<br>alternative<br>responsible tourism is supposed to<br>benefit<br>the local communities and help elevate<br>poverty reduce poverty<br>create livelihoods and revitalize<br>culture<br>but unfortunately when i was doing my<br>field work in ubud bali i really didn't<br>find that so um so my question is how<br>can we develop spiritual tourism in a<br>more inclusive sustainable way in a post<br>copy the world taking covet pandemic as<br>a kind of turning point or as a kind of<br>transformative uh period<br>next slide please<br>thank you so um my talk will be based on<br>my peer talking over bali<br>primarily and these are uh some of the<br>findings i found from spiritual tourism<br>impact in in ubud so what<br>if you heard of it it became a d<br>spiritual tourism destination in in asia<br>and indonesia because of the very famous<br>film he pray love<br>it's arguable but many scholars would um<br>would point this out<br>so this oh this small town used to be a<br>little village not many tourists but now<br>the international tourism destination<br>for yoga and other spiritual activities<br>and what they've done to local<br>communities<br>they have created jobs obviously right<br>but mostly low income jobs for locals<br>and what i learned from my failed of<br>course was very sad that local people<br>had to sell their properties and land<br>and farms<br>so foreign investors can build these<br>beautiful inclusive yoga research and<br>spiritual facilities<br>so um<br>is it really benefiting local<br>communities the tourism boom spiritual<br>trojan boom was not really um benefiting<br>local communities and actually poor<br>local people have become poorer because<br>they sold the properties they sold the<br>land and you know they were getting just<br>these low income jobs as a cleaner or<br>receptionist or or drivers<br>and also often these spiritual tourism<br>products and programs are quite<br>disconnected from the local spiritual<br>cultures and when i was talking to the<br>local people they're quite concerned<br>about losing the traditional culture due<br>to this over commercialization<br>next slide please thank you and there<br>are actually some opportunities i made<br>parents local yoga teachers they used to<br>be housewives they didn't really have<br>jobs but they also wanted to have jobs<br>but they see this picture tourism boom<br>and so they become yoga teachers they<br>were actually very happy and one of them<br>um taiyo who has become my friend she<br>actually opened the vegan cafe because<br>she so why some people come to ubud<br>after yoga they all go to vegan cafe and<br>have smoothies so oh i'm gonna open<br>vegan cafe and sell smoothie sushi<br>actually opened a vegan cafe she was<br>doing where until corbin happened<br>but<br>for daiyu it's still very hard to<br>compete with these fancy you know<br>facilities and vegan gaps run by<br>actuation people who know what customers<br>want who know how to you know make this<br>fancy vegan dishes and smoothies<br>and come up with the facilities and<br>these local people who are involved in<br>spiritual tourism yoga tourism or<br>meditation tourism obviously have a lack<br>of resources skills and experiences also<br>confidence<br>and interestingly when i talked to them<br>i was asking them would you like to have<br>financial support from the government so<br>you can you know help with your<br>businesses but they said no we're not<br>very interested in cash support we want<br>training we want to do like the other<br>western people do like running you know<br>programs that customers want and what is<br>the ones right so they said they're very<br>interested in getting proper training<br>they need and they want to learn english<br>and also interesting they said they want<br>to have access to data and networking<br>opportunities with other local elites<br>and foreign investors and boarding<br>managers so they know how to run the<br>businesses so they're very interested in<br>the the data and training um<br>uh aspect which was very interesting and<br>even during call visit you can see in<br>the picture<br>some of the western ran yoga studios and<br>spiritual facilities<br>sustain sustained business with uh<br>virtual yoga classes and virtual cooking<br>classes so some of them saw some<br>business very well but this yoga local<br>yoga teachers and facilities couldn't<br>because they didn't have the digital<br>skills um so that that was kind of a big<br>gap<br>in this town next slide please<br>thank you so<br>during coffee the time<br>obviously or as kevin mentioned people<br>might be more interested in meaningful<br>travel slow travel you know something<br>more spiritual um<br>and go to spiritual destinations in the<br>post copy time i mean it's still very um<br>difficult to say when is the post copy<br>time right<br>and also interesting i'm in europe i<br>feel like we're living in post kobe time<br>but whenever i go back to asia<br>you know still not really post copy time<br>and there's<br>between these two continents and<br>that's a different story but anyways<br>many experts uh are also um arguing<br>people might be more interested in<br>picture wellness<br>um<br>tourism in the post covered time and<br>there is a there might be opportunities<br>that<br>uh destinations and authorities and<br>tourism businesses develop more<br>inclusive more sustainable spiritual<br>tourism models and programs in the post<br>copy time learning from these previous<br>problems and you know the leakages and<br>transporters so in the post cover time<br>they can do something better for the<br>local communities uh and local people as<br>well not just for you know upper middle<br>class white uh european or american<br>tourists for spiritual tourism so i<br>think it's<br>it's in a way it's kind of good to pause<br>now to think about this<br>to you know change the elections for<br>spiritual tourism development in<br>southeast east asia<br>from now<br>so these are some of the suggestions i<br>have and i also have been discussing<br>with my um friends in bali who are<br>running spiritual tourist businesses<br>and these are some of the examples<br>so spiritual tourism programs and<br>products should be diversified and<br>differentiated i mean if you go to<br>bangkok hanoi or bali<br>or any places in southeast asia you<br>receive very similar repetitive<br>spiritual tourism you know products<br>right yoga classes meditation retreats<br>spa massage<br>it doesn't really matter which country<br>you go right that's a huge problem i<br>think<br>and especially in southeast asia they<br>have very rich<br>historical spiritual heritage and<br>resources which haven't been really<br>utilized<br>and the problem is that those tourism<br>developers are mostly you know foreign<br>investors<br>who don't really<br>learn from local people about the local<br>unique spiritual heritage and resources<br>and there's again huge gap in this so i<br>think in the post kovis uh period these<br>ambassadors developers governments<br>authorities and businesses<br>should learn from local people and<br>communities about what kind of resources<br>they have what kind of traditions<br>heritage<br>are there in the in the each<br>location so they'll be very very<br>important to to implement and consider<br>and i feel like we're missing on<br>so much potential and resources for<br>spiritual tourism in southeast asia by<br>just providing kind of western imagined<br>products and programs<br>and in the post cover time there'll be<br>more maybe uh demand on nature-based<br>spiritual activities in remote and rural<br>areas so we can imagine people might<br>especially spiritual tourists might<br>avoid going to urban locations for<br>spiritual tourism or famous places for<br>spiritual tourism but they might travel<br>a little bit further<br>to um you know kind of recover from all<br>these lockdowns and stress caused by<br>pandemic and psychologically and<br>mentally and physically recover in a<br>very quiet tranquil more authentic<br>places<br>and there might be opportunities for<br>rural villages that have<br>high poverty rates in southeast asia to<br>utilize this demand to recover from<br>pandemic and negative impacts also<br>create new livelihoods<br>for example for long term um next slide<br>please<br>so um this is my last uh slide but of<br>course it sounds all great rural you<br>know villages or little uh lima villages<br>will have advantage over spiritual<br>tourism<br>growth in the post kobe time but one of<br>the biggest challenges is<br>these rural villages in southeast asia<br>including indonesia thailand or vienna<br>many countries very very hard to access<br>to or get to right<br>so even though there is a potential<br>resources demand and local people want<br>to develop spiritual tourism um it's<br>actually in practical sense really<br>really difficult because tourists really<br>cannot get there by public<br>transportation and i think more<br>governments and outdoor tourism<br>authorities should realize this and<br>invest in um<br>public transportation and infrastructure<br>and actually lao government has been<br>very active in this during pandemic time<br>they've been investing so much money on<br>road development and new train<br>development that might<br>change the game in the post um<br>time i'm very excited to see this but<br>there should be more investment on<br>infrastructure for lower tourism<br>development not just even spiritual<br>tourism or tourism development in<br>general<br>and also government and authorities<br>should support small spiritual tourism<br>initiatives and uh businesses<br>based on what they actually need not<br>just throwing cash at them but just<br>listen to what they want need<br>trainings or marketing trends or data or<br>networking opportunities events for them<br>to help them<br>develop their spiritual tourism products<br>in a more sustainable and inclusive way<br>and for my last point there should be<br>more sophisticated research on spiritual<br>towards the market multiple segments<br>different concept of spirituality is<br>required so for example during cover the<br>time<br>they are having more domestic tourists<br>traveling to spiritual destinations and<br>sites within the countries and there is<br>not there's not much<br>data or research about domestic tourist<br>spiritual tourism activities and<br>behavior and i'm sure bangladesh<br>people's concept of spiritual tourism or<br>spiritual activities might be very very<br>different from western tourists so there<br>should be more research on domestic<br>tourist uh spiritual tourism behavior<br>and preferences as well and there is<br>again there's no one market for<br>spiritual tourism for a country there's<br>multiple markets budget travelers<br>backpackers so we should just widen the<br>the scope of research the previous or<br>against research on spiritual tourism<br>often focusing on um<br>you know like a middle class tour is<br>going to<br>these poor countries for their spiritual<br>activities and that should should be<br>shifted and expanded<br>in the future for researchers like me as<br>well<br>i think that's it<br>fantastic gian thank you so much for the<br>conclusion it's been really interesting<br>to see especially a demands a<br>supply-side perspective to complement<br>and kevin's presentation focusing more<br>on demand and consumer trends and the q<br>and a's are rolling in i would like to<br>start with a question from daniel that<br>i've been asking myself as well<br>daniel asks what is the difference<br>between religious and spiritual tourism<br>if spiritual toys travel to religious<br>sites for example temples and my thought<br>around it was sort of similar also in<br>line where then the line between<br>spiritual tourism and wellness tourism<br>is being drawn<br>and what conceptualizations do we have<br>available or definitions to make sense<br>of these overlapping yet quite distinct<br>segments<br>that's a great question i get this<br>question actually all the time<br>but um spiritual tourism can be related<br>to religious sites obviously right but<br>not necessarily it's a com according to<br>alex norman who is my favorite spiritual<br>tourism scholar<br>spiritual tourism is actually about<br>fully focusing on solving my problems<br>during leisure travel<br>but it can happen around you know<br>religious sites but it's not necessarily<br>going to religious sites so that might<br>be a big difference so you go to chiang<br>mai uh to<br>learn how to meditate and<br>learn mindfulness but you might not be<br>necessarily interested in buddhism<br>so that might be kind of<br>catching the the core concept of<br>spiritual tourism would they make sense<br>but of course this is sorry this is also<br>interesting that like how western<br>scholars define spiritual tourism and<br>how uh my balinese academic scholars<br>define spiritualism has been also<br>different and i'm working on paper with<br>my parents scholar friends but we've<br>been kind of like having lots of<br>discussions on on what spiritual tourism<br>means but how she my balance academic<br>fantasies spiritual tourism has been<br>also very very different from i've<br>learned from um you know existing<br>research<br>so okay like having mentioned earlier<br>it's really difficult to define<br>um what spiritual tourism is and it can<br>mean really different to everyone in<br>this room but if i had to um emphasize<br>one element that that might be the<br>difference and and again and you<br>mentioned dina that you you haven't seen<br>much of religious tourism literature but<br>you know if you<br>the<br>i've diagrammed there earlier showing<br>spiritual to secular<br>and you know traditionally there would<br>have been a big<br>belief that you know you can you have to<br>be religious or you have to be secular<br>you know<br>the the<br>more<br>current belief is you know<br>you can flip from one to the other on<br>you know completely seamlessly<br>somebody for example could be going to<br>learn how to do yoga<br>no interest in spirituality and have a<br>spiritual experience<br>or you know i talked to somebody who did<br>the the kamino to santiago and they were<br>doing it purely as a<br>physical<br>you know<br>get away from the world exercise they<br>had no interest in religion and they had<br>quite a conversion moment<br>halfway through the journey where they<br>met people and talked with they came<br>back<br>you know with a reinvigorated religion<br>that they hadn't practiced for<br>20 years so you know<br>then you hear the opposite so you know<br>there's the boundaries between the two<br>typically when you talk about religious<br>tourism it's following particular<br>religious<br>practices<br>i won't say regulations but you know<br>you're there following a particular<br>faith a particular set of belief systems<br>um where spirituality is is<br>um<br>yeah it's different<br>um<br>but yeah lots of overlap<br>yeah and i just added a comment um from<br>the audience as well office called this<br>combination of religious<br>self-transformation tourism and<br>and and you know and and you yeah anyone<br>who researches this will have multiple<br>kind of<br>i i think the the better the more you<br>read about is one of these things the<br>more you read about the less you realize<br>you know about it<br>and people who are very definitive you<br>know hard and fast rules<br>um you know i i i don't think we need<br>that too much it's not doing known as a<br>huge amount of<br>favor<br>yeah i actually also had a very<br>interesting conversation with my friends<br>who's doing programming research at the<br>university of oxford i asked her how do<br>you define pilgrimage and she said her<br>definition is no definition of<br>pilgrimage and<br>that was it just kind of you know<br>enlightening thinning in a way she's<br>been<br>listening only on programming and she<br>said there is no definition<br>on pilgrimage and that's the definition<br>from her<br>thank you<br>then have them choose somewhat related<br>questions in the chat as well again for<br>jon we've got a couple for kevin as well<br>we'll go back after this but we're just<br>on the floor at the moment with the<br>spirituality<br>um kieran says john thank you for the<br>fantastic presentation one question that<br>might be hypothetical but with asking is<br>how would the local balinese<br>entrepreneurs who now sees the ritual<br>tourists as customers deal with the worn<br>out and cave with influence travelers<br>who might be looking for something else<br>than just the old pre-pandemic kind of<br>spiritual experience essentially really<br>i think how our local entrepreneurs how<br>is the tourism industry within these<br>destinations adapting or hoping to adapt<br>to changes induced mechanic 19 in<br>consumer behavior in this statement<br>so how it<br>there are they just need to change the<br>post code time right<br>is it right<br>it's essentially how are we expecting<br>consumer behavior in spiritual tourism<br>to change post covert and what the<br>implications of that for the local and<br>tourism industry are for the um supply<br>side<br>okay i mean of course i i'm not a<br>fortune teller so i cannot you know have<br>a definite um answers but i just imagine<br>based on or or the readings people might<br>be more interested in going to um<br>you know kind of non-famous lure remote<br>places for<br>for their spiritual tourism compared to<br>before and actually this was like<br>happening already in 2018 and 19 so uber<br>is very uh famous for spiritual tourism<br>but actually like spiritual tourists<br>didn't like the the the town becoming<br>too famous too commercialized so they<br>are going beyond<br>wood and going to more rural smaller<br>areas i think that might happen um in<br>the post covered time people go to more<br>kind of non-famous quiet place just to<br>focus on themselves<br>so that that might happen and also<br>people<br>will look for not just yoga or<br>meditation but also look for some<br>americans offer healthy<br>vegan vegetarian diet um as a kind of<br>kind of package as well<br>and also people will look for small<br>places<br>where they can learn about their culture<br>i think linked to that as well is that<br>there is a<br>i think a global drive<br>whether it's<br>supplier demand driven is but might go<br>back to daniel's question earlier<br>to try and professionalize pilgrimage<br>and really just travel a little bit more<br>so if you think of i'm thinking of the<br>project you're you're looking at jay and<br>i don't know much about it in pilgrimage<br>in wales but you know i i<br>there's there's actually a project which<br>i'm ten gently involved in with the<br>south west southeast of ireland and<br>wales looking at a joint pilgrimage<br>trail<br>one of the big limiting factors there is<br>and it's down to the logistics of<br>is there enough accommodation along the<br>route for people to walk from place to<br>you know which organically grew with the<br>camino to san diego<br>and it's it has set the the kind of the<br>marker you must have cheap<br>pilgrim accommodation every x number of<br>kilometers and food and and it's<br>becoming you know every trail that's<br>developing is looking at<br>can we get the local community to<br>provide accommodation or do we get<br>professional and you know<br>it's<br>that kind of commercialization and<br>product<br>packaging and all that is becoming quite<br>a challenge for new emerging pilgrimage<br>destinations<br>kevin it's very interesting you<br>mentioned that actually during my<br>project in wales we learned that there's<br>absolutely lack of accommodation in<br>wales and there are too many workers to<br>play criminal insights in the past two<br>years and now<br>just lack of accommodation and<br>uh and we've been asking churches to<br>open their buildings as a you know<br>accommodation and have bankrupt and<br>things and that haven't actually<br>happened yet but yeah and toilets and<br>cafes and restaurants<br>just you know doesn't meet the numbers<br>of these kind of spiritual workers and<br>pilgrim pilgrims so huge problem in<br>wales<br>in line with that we've got a question<br>and in the chat from najigarevi he was<br>picking up on some of the pictures that<br>we've seen within kevin's presentation<br>she asks and from a consumer behavior<br>perspective how much do you think there<br>will be engagement in terms of using a<br>virtual reality headset as a replacement<br>for wheel traveling to pilgrimage sites<br>perhaps also in line with balancing<br>demand overcrowding and some of the<br>challenges you've just touched upon<br>i i i think honestly if you ask me to be<br>totally frank i don't think it's going<br>to affect<br>the the existing pilgrimage practice<br>model demand whatever i think is going<br>to create another type of<br>demand<br>um<br>i i i reckon that a lot of these sites<br>have been created aren't going to<br>decrease the number of people traveling<br>you know but if if you have places as i<br>said like mecca which you know muslims<br>have an obligation to travel to if<br>they're able to within their lifetime<br>if you know<br>travel restrictions<br>and<br>um the number of people in a physical<br>place has to be limited what's your<br>alternative so i don't think it's going<br>to reduce the number of people traveling<br>to make it but i think it's going to<br>give an alternative to people who can't<br>likewise you know you can virtually do<br>all sorts of pilgrimage trails all over<br>the world<br>um<br>you know there's been people who have<br>run<br>you know do the camino in your local<br>town by walking you know walk x amount<br>per day and we'll have a prayer session<br>in the evening and you know that kind of<br>thing has been happening all through<br>covert<br>not just for religious reasons for<br>people who are into extreme cycling<br>they're sitting in their their garage on<br>television screen in front of them<br>climbing the alps you know that<br>that doesn't stop someone climbing the<br>alps when they physically can go there<br>um so i don't think i know i showed nice<br>images of it but i really don't see it<br>as replacing what's there but i think<br>it's going to supplement is a supplement<br>supplement rather than supplanters i<br>think kind of terminologies<br>yeah<br>it's interesting that you see potential<br>and also on the topic of consumer<br>behavior eliza raymond says a really<br>interesting presentations thank you what<br>would your recommendation be for<br>spiritual tourists themselves who want<br>to have a more positive impact on their<br>destinations which i suppose is a<br>question coming at the time when jiren<br>was just talking about the indonesian<br>context but could be translated to<br>religious tourism in line with those<br>challenges as well<br>how to be a responsible religious or<br>spiritual tourist i i think it's like<br>other forms of responsible tourism and<br>one of the big ways to do it is to do<br>less frequent longer trips<br>and somewhere like a you know a 20-day<br>hike across the country staying in local<br>accommodation eating local food<br>is enormously beneficial for a local<br>area whether it's in southeast asia or<br>west wales or up in the you know<br>anywhere in the world<br>and there are people that's what they<br>want you know<br>whether it's one of the the appalachian<br>trail in america or the<br>you know a religious trail in japan you<br>know<br>doing that kind of journey<br>on on your own feet with no transport<br>other than getting you there and back<br>home um that to me is as sustainable as<br>something like that possibly can be<br>that's true and one thing very simple<br>tourists can do<br>for example if they go to ubu bali stay<br>in local homestay and go to local<br>restaurants which tourists don't do in<br>in uber there's so many nice<br>american hotels they provide you<br>everything like you know like yoga<br>classes meditation retreats and<br>workshops and vegan cafe and nice<br>smoothies so they just stay in the this<br>um yeah and they have a nice you know<br>rice farm views so they don't get out of<br>the resort but just don't stay there and<br>stay in local homes stay home states and<br>you know hang out with the local people<br>actually in the big problem there are<br>hundreds of uh home stays<br>uh provided by local people and there<br>there's just way less demand now so<br>poor people actually losing their<br>businesses because they're relying on<br>their lives<br>on this someday businesses but because<br>of this american hotels they're losing<br>you know their income sources so that's<br>one simple thing they can do i think<br>thank you<br>we've got um<br>a little bit more time um we also have<br>time to address and steward mcdonald's<br>question in the chat which is looking<br>more at the promotion or the marketing<br>side of religious tourism<br>i'm saying i've got a question from a<br>tourism promotion point of view in<br>thailand's case buddhism is an often<br>promoted facet of the country's efforts<br>but in indonesia and malaysia the<br>islamic nature of the countries is<br>underplayed at least by tourism boards<br>do you think this is a missed<br>opportunity<br>i absolutely think so yeah i absolutely<br>agree with this point like 200 percent i<br>mean thailand beats up with this country<br>so they've been advertising the country<br>as a spiritual destination right and<br>they've been um you know advertising<br>chiang mai as a buddhist destination<br>very well and chiang mai is the most the<br>most popular uh places to go for<br>spiritual tourism in southeast asia but<br>indonesia manager yeah because of this<br>political<br>or religious conflict or i'm trying to<br>be careful sensitivity sensitivity<br>i think the government and authorities<br>haven't been diligent with promoting<br>them as a spiritual destination even<br>bali so yeah there is a big problem and<br>they're definitely missing out huge huge<br>the potential resources and tourism and<br>incomes<br>so something they really should realize<br>but but i think if we could circle back<br>to what we were talking about earlier<br>which is the statistics<br>you know there are you know<br>religious villages religious<br>tourist attractions being created um<br>across southeast asia<br>which we really aren't seeing statistics<br>from<br>you know<br>you know there's islamic villages<br>where they're you know you you can go<br>and stay with<br>the highest standards of food of service<br>all following the correct codes and<br>practices<br>um<br>and<br>particularly from the western world<br>we're not seeing that you know we we<br>don't get any<br>um<br>data from that part of the world<br>that we can<br>interpret and understand as i said if<br>the world if anyone knows the world<br>tourism organization we should be you<br>know<br>absolutely pushing them into looking at<br>this in in detail i i don't think it's<br>as as as as the questioner asked there i<br>don't think it says<br>invisible as we think it is but we're<br>not seeing the data coming through um<br>there's quite a bit of marketing and<br>product development happening<br>um particularly indonesia<br>um of of individual towns being at our<br>locations being identified with temples<br>and mosques and you know being being<br>developed yeah<br>thank you so much we're going to bring<br>the q a to a close now because we'd<br>still like to hand over just for a<br>minute um to one of our
