accurate.</p><p>it's great pleasure to have our panel<br>here today<br>dominic stevens<br>leilani free and brad olsen all<br>well-known people with long experience<br>in housing and infrastructure<br>so we'll go um straight into the<br>presentations before we do that i just<br>make the one observation uh that last<br>week housing in new zealand made the<br>economist so<br>we must be doing something right or<br>something terribly wrong<br>to get there so let's see what the<br>insights are<br>we'll start off with uh dominic then go<br>to leilani<br>welcome dominic<br>thanks very much frank for the uh for<br>the introduction um i do think it's fair<br>to say that over the past 20 30 years<br>the rise and rise and rise of new<br>zealand house prices has<br>has really bested many economic<br>forecasters and policy makers in new<br>zealand<br>and i think as a profession we owe it to<br>the public of new zealand to confront<br>that fact<br>and to think through well what is it<br>about the housing market that is<br>behaving a little bit differently to<br>perhaps what we've thought um i thought<br>jim bulger said it uh really well in his<br>sort of closing remarks yesterday he<br>talked about the definition of insanity<br>it's trying to do the same thing over<br>and over again and expecting the same<br>different result<br>so i think the the dominant idea<br>that has pervaded thinking on the<br>housing market in new zealand for the<br>past 20 years is that the ups and downs<br>of house prices or mostly the ups are<br>related to physical supply and demand of<br>dwellings on the ground<br>so whether house prices go up or down<br>people talk about migration construction<br>activity<br>the relationship between the two or<br>perhaps construction costs<br>and i really think that idea um it has<br>it really has theoretical merit but it's<br>really been challenged by the data on<br>the ground<br>most obviously over the past two years<br>we've seen zero net migration<br>to new zealand so very very low<br>population growth and absolutely booming<br>construction activity highest in decades<br>and yet the rate of house price<br>inflation has been the highest on record<br>off a really big base<br>more subtly if we look back over 20<br>years<br>well if it was really about supply of<br>dwellings and the housing shortage or<br>there is a housing shortage if that was<br>the cause of rising house prices well<br>it should have caused rents to rise too<br>but actually over 20 years back to 2001<br>rents are up in real inflation-adjusted<br>terms 47<br>house prices have more than trebled so<br>the difference between the two is a<br>completely different order of magnitude<br>increase between prices and rents and<br>indeed it's the house price to rent<br>ratio and the blowout in that ratio that<br>needs explaining<br>um construction sector again probably<br>has played a role but in real inflation<br>adjusted terms again since 2001 uh<br>purchase of new dwellings part of the<br>the the consumer price index which<br>measures the cost of putting a dwelling<br>on empty land up 67<br>house prices up 240 in real terms so<br>again it most of the increase is<br>actually in land not construction and<br>then finally there's just no concordance<br>between where<br>the<br>population growth and housing shortages<br>have been in new zealand and house price<br>inflation actually there are four<br>territorial authorities that have had<br>population decline over 20 years and<br>they are among the biggest house price<br>increases in the country<br>so i think there's there's definitely<br>some real challenges to the way housing<br>markets have been thought about and i'm<br>pleased to say that at the treasury and<br>and elsewhere that how we think about<br>housing markets is changing<br>we heard the reserve bank governor just<br>today say that or acknowledge that the<br>biggest<br>cause of rising house prices over the<br>past 20 years in new zealand according<br>to their research is a global decline in<br>interest rates at the treasury we are<br>putting more more focus on interest<br>rates and our house price forecasting of<br>course you know interest rates affect<br>asset prices of all stripes they drive<br>them up relative to the underlying<br>stream of earnings and<br>new zealand houses are no exception<br>but the really interesting thing is why<br>drops in interest rates lead to higher<br>house prices not not lower rents and<br>that comes down to the supply of land<br>opposed to the supply of dwellings<br>as i say the traditional thinking on the<br>housing market it's it's got really good<br>theoretical foundations it's it's it's<br>based in the traditional housing model<br>which which actually at its core<br>has an assumption that there's plentiful<br>land available for development<br>so if there's something like an interest<br>rate decline comes along and it's<br>permanent well that could drive house<br>prices up but it'll drive them above the<br>cost of getting some more land off of<br>farmer at the edge of town<br>and plus the cost of actually putting a<br>house on that land that'll create a<br>supply response<br>and that'll bring house prices back down<br>again<br>and actually that model predicts that a<br>permanent decline in interest rates<br>would lead to lower rents over the long<br>run<br>actually that traditional model is<br>unable to<br>explain<br>persistent changes in house prices<br>relative to incomes it can't uh and<br>that's why people forecast typically<br>think that houses housing market will<br>come to its senses and come back down<br>when they when they see house prices go<br>up or that<br>people think about well there must be<br>something wrong with the construction<br>response because because supply hasn't<br>kicked in<br>i think the theoretical or the the<br>theory of that model is fine but the the<br>underlying assumption of plentiful land<br>just is not new zealand's reality and<br>has not been new zealand's reality for<br>quite some time<br>i think in fact in new zealand the<br>ability of urban areas to obtain land<br>for development either out or up so to<br>use land in a different way either out<br>or up<br>is is really very constrained so<br>restrictions on the supply of land<br>really change the way you think about<br>housing markets and i'll just just get<br>you to imagine for a second a world<br>where land was completely restricted<br>well in that case price of land will<br>have nothing to do with the value of a<br>farm at the edge of town<br>rents will be anchored<br>to<br>what tenants can pay so incomes and<br>physical supply demand of dwellings that<br>sort of thing<br>but if an interest rate decline comes<br>along well that'll drive house prices up<br>as the net present value of the future<br>flow of rents goes up so<br>you know standard asset pricing theory<br>but here's the key<br>what will happen is that that decline in<br>interest rates or the value of it will<br>get captured in the value of land if<br>land is really very restricted in supply<br>so what you'll see is land prices going<br>up as well as house prices and the gap<br>between the two won't change<br>meaning no real change in incentive to<br>build new dwellings<br>no supply response necessarily and no<br>not necessarily any change in in rents<br>and in fact that's a general idea that<br>if land is really restricted in supply<br>then changes to things like taxes even<br>construction costs will be captured in<br>the value of land and will not<br>necessarily alter<br>the incentive to build new dwellings on<br>that land and will therefore not<br>necessarily alter rents and i think<br>that's why we're seeing house prices<br>respond to interest rates um not not<br>rents<br>now i do want to qualify a couple of<br>things here um i've just sort of<br>presented a really extreme case of<br>completely fixed land supply and<br>contrasted it was completely abundant<br>neither is the real world actually<br>reality lies somewhere in between and<br>what we need is more thinking and<br>research on<br>where new zealand sits on that spectrum<br>and i also just want to qualify that i'm<br>not for a second saying that physical<br>supply and demand doesn't matter at all<br>for the housing market of course it does<br>it really matters for rents for example<br>it's just that<br>we can tell its importance by what has<br>happened to rents we can see say for<br>example christchurch after the<br>earthquakes you saw<br>supply of housing relative to the<br>population really dropped away you saw<br>rents rise actually more than prices<br>supply response kicked in rents and<br>prices both underperformed the rest of<br>new zealand that's what a market looks<br>like experiencing a shortage of<br>dwellings and it just<br>doesn't explain a lot of what's happened<br>in the in the wider new zealand housing<br>market over 20 years although it does<br>explain particular places in particular<br>times<br>okay so restricted land supply or<br>falling interest rates in the context of<br>restricted land supply is the biggest<br>thing going on in the new zealand<br>housing market how does that<br>affect our policy thinking i think first<br>of all we're using<br>the relative role of interest rates<br>relative to migration and physical<br>supply demand is changing in our<br>forecasts we're putting more weight on<br>interest rates<br>secondly your policy solutions are going<br>to really zero in on<br>the effective supply of land the ability<br>of urban markets to access or change the<br>use of<br>either change the use of land within the<br>urban area or access land on the outside<br>and that's what i'm hoping um leilani<br>will will talk about and it's why we've<br>got infrastructure connected to housing<br>in this in this topic<br>um outside of that i think that the idea<br>that changes get uh absorbed into land<br>prices means we should revisit tax<br>when we think about the housing market i<br>think successive tax working groups have<br>feared that taxing housing would cause<br>would reduce the incentive to build new<br>houses causing a reduction in supply and<br>an ultimate increase in rents and again<br>i i think that's<br>abundant land supply thinking and new<br>zealand's reality is actually different<br>to that<br>um i think we should really focus our<br>attention on what drives rents both<br>because if you're locked out of the<br>housing market rents are really what<br>matter to you they matter for well-being<br>but they're also<br>really important for thinking about well<br>if we're thinking of of housing kind of<br>prices are being affected by their<br>investment value well the underlying<br>stream of rents really matters<br>and lastly i think we need to zero in on<br>what the problem actually is in new<br>zealand<br>it's actually interest rates have fallen<br>so far that it's actually really very<br>affordable to service a mortgage even at<br>very high house prices now<br>relative to incomes<br>what's changed is the affordability of a<br>deposit it's exceedingly<br>difficult on new zealand incomes to to<br>muster a deposit to buy a house that is<br>the actual nub of the issue and it's<br>causing people to be locked out of the<br>market so let's zero in on that and<br>maybe consider<br>what would help people overcome that<br>essentially liquidity constraint um of<br>mustering a deposit<br>thank you dominic<br>you've put a number of issues on the<br>table and<br>so<br>so thank you for the opportunity to join<br>us today and to the university of<br>waikato and my culture management school<br>for bringing us all together um<br>so<br>the topic of housing and infrastructure<br>is so broad i think we could go in a<br>number of directions and i appreciate<br>that john has sort of zeroed into a<br>couple<br>um but i also appreciate that the q a<br>section of this panel may indeed go into<br>more broader areas<br>i did want to kind of start with the<br>qualifier i'm not an economist so i'm<br>not going to come up the discussion from<br>that perspective so apologies to those<br>that i hope that i do<br>i am however fortunate enough to be a<br>homeowner i'm fortunate to be a home<br>investor and i am currently a renter as<br>well<br>and in my day job my focus is on the<br>delivery end enabling housing and<br>infrastructure to be delivered and<br>bring that perspective to<br>the policy development and<br>implementation activities of government<br>so kind of what is my perspectives<br>i start quite at a high level we've got<br>all got these really basic needs and<br>expectations when it comes to housing<br>and infrastructure<br>home is a base where we and our whanau<br>can feel safe and warm<br>and infrastructure that kind of connects<br>us to all the places that we want to<br>either work live play<br>um<br>and or<br>access the services that we're looking<br>for to be our personal services that we<br>need<br>and so don mentioned you know we've got<br>some growing population challenges and i<br>would add into it changing citizen<br>expectations on how we want to actually<br>access those places that we want to live<br>work and play and get services from<br>um so those couple of factors have kind<br>of created this step change and how we<br>need to think about housing and<br>infrastructure so i fully support<br>john's perspective that we need to<br>really quite think differently as we<br>sort of lean into those headwinds that<br>are creating the challenges for us<br>but in particular from my perspective<br>it's about how we facilitate and enable<br>that access<br>to uh housing and infrastructure that's<br>important<br>and unfortunately you know there's no<br>silver bullet no one-size-fits-all kind<br>of solution as you all know um many many<br>drivers that are impacting access and<br>enabling um they're very they're diverse<br>they're interdependent and don's touched<br>on a<br>what also is clear from my perspective<br>is that there is a need for the whole<br>ecosystem to align to deliver all of<br>these solutions that are grounded really<br>really kind of around it enabling people<br>to get access to housing and<br>infrastructure<br>so there's a real role for the private<br>sector you know as employers for jobs<br>banks access to financing businesses in<br>terms of access to construction and<br>supply the supply side and there's<br>definitely obviously a role for<br>government in the regulatory policy and<br>funding<br>side so again supporting predominantly<br>access on this from the supply side<br>so<br>um as don mentioned you know it's pretty<br>clear from government perspective that<br>restricted land supply is one of the<br>biggest<br>underlying drivers of the high cost of<br>housing and i'd also suggest that it's<br>also quite a constraining factor in our<br>ability to provide infrastructure needed<br>to service the populations<br>the populations and the<br>and the regional and city centers when<br>um when they need it<br>so<br>and what what can government kind of do<br>is as i said i'm kind of focused on a<br>delivery end um and agree completely<br>with dominic's position that the focus<br>has been on<br>creating a greater ability to free up<br>land supply for housing and<br>infrastructure and also a greater<br>ability to enable development now and<br>into the future so things like planning<br>for more growth<br>up and out is probably the way to think<br>about that<br>um greater land use and infrastructure<br>integration and we've seen a few<br>recent government announcements that are<br>very much around<br>integrated housing and infrastructure<br>projects coming forward<br>wider use of infrastructure corridor and<br>site protections<br>to facilitate and maybe reduce the<br>impact of uh land price inflation when<br>and if government's ready to make those<br>sorts of investments<br>creating a sort of a more enabling<br>regulatory environment it provides<br>the ability to not just look at how we<br>imple implement um<br>change or planning of getting planning<br>approvals through easier but also the<br>types of uh chains that are going to be<br>needed in the in those types of planning<br>approvals need to kind of be facilitated<br>easier<br>um<br>and then infrastructure funding and<br>financing i think it relatively speaks<br>for itself and then the other sort of<br>sleeper is probably the capacity and<br>capability of the whole ecosystem to<br>deliver and i'll touch on that one a<br>little bit later um<br>a little bit<br>so<br>um<br>the focus there for what we kind of what<br>we are doing is<br>in terms of enabling access<br>and facilitating some of those outcomes<br>i just mentioned<br>a lot of focus in that planning space<br>the key signature because<br>activities around the appeal of the<br>resource management act i know you're<br>very very very familiar probably with<br>what that act is trying to achieve<br>taking one act breaking it into three<br>but very inter-related pieces of<br>legislation<br>one that focuses predominantly on the<br>natural and built environments it's<br>going to be the primary piece of<br>legislation that replaces the rma<br>and it's focused predominantly on land<br>use and environmental protection<br>it'll work in tandem with the sec the<br>second act the strategic planning act<br>that's to set out an approach to<br>long-term and strategic planning<br>around how we use land and the coastal<br>marine area in new zealand and then the<br>final act<br>is around climate adaptation as we<br>lean into the complexities of what we<br>need to do to really address the complex<br>environment that we need to operate and<br>operate in to meet um the the needs and<br>commitments for for the country in terms<br>of climate change<br>so taking all together those three acts<br>of kind of you know being brought uh to<br>the fore now<br>and really trying to support uh that<br>enabling uh role in the regulatory space<br>particularly the planning space and<br>facilitating easier<br>decision making to unlock<br>a sort of land supply<br>as<br>an example<br>um<br>big piece and definitely a big lever and<br>i think an important lever but it's not<br>sufficient allowing to address the<br>issues so infrastructure provision and<br>funding is also going to play a really<br>key role in enabling the development<br>that the plan the act sets up<br>us to be uh to to hack a step change in<br>the way we address these issues but um<br>we do yeah we do need to<br>realize that it's not the silver bullet<br>it's not a silver bullet<br>so one initiative and that's happening<br>at the moment is the there's an iff act<br>2020 and it was it was established to<br>enable new funding and financing for<br>um the provision of new and<br>infrastructure for housing and urban<br>development so not the big guy<br>infrastructure you know not the big<br>chains and schools and hospitals but<br>predominantly their small infrastructure<br>and in my opinion the most important<br>infrastructure to facilitate increased<br>land access for housing infrastructure<br>like telecommunications water sewerage<br>and local roads so that's you know a<br>sort of initiative that government's<br>pushing forward with um to try and and<br>acknowledges and realizes that enabling<br>infrastructure for land development is<br>just as important as having the land<br>itself<br>um<br>i note that um<br>even if we do get some of those enabling<br>factors that i just mentioned are sorted<br>and in place<br>as i mentioned earlier it's the capacity<br>and capability<br>of people businesses and government that<br>will be just as important to<br>make sure that we address the challenges<br>in front of us that ecosystem that i<br>mentioned earlier you know getting that<br>aligned and working together<br>i appreciate that is a whole topic in<br>and of itself but as you all know we're<br>already seeing headwinds particularly<br>say in the construction space of the<br>constraints that are impacting um our<br>construction sector in particular<br>around capacity and capability<br>and unless we kind of find a way to<br>address those i think that they will<br>also<br>impact the speed at which<br>newly available land can be developed<br>and released to support housing and<br>infrastructure development<br>so i'll probably leave it there and<br>hopefully i've given a couple of<br>perspectives of how i see the challenges<br>and shared you know what government's<br>kind of doing to try and enable<br>greater access to land and<br>infrastructure and look forward to the q<br>a part of the panel discussion<br>thank you leilani<br>we will go to bread but before we get to<br>bread<br>i just encourage them to be brief you<br>know it's really good if we can get some<br>q a at the end so brad we look forward<br>to your um sharp and incisive insights<br>kia ora uh frank and kyota and good<br>morning everyone i i will keep them<br>brief i think dominic made a a an<br>important<br>starting point very clear<br>around that need to acknowledge where<br>we've gone wrong previously and i think<br>to expand that<br>certainly new zealand as a country i<br>think needs to admit the failure that<br>we've had when it comes to<br>infrastructure because really that is at<br>the key of where we've gone wrong and<br>and just how we've got ourselves into<br>the position that you're telling young<br>new zealanders that they need to find<br>you know potentially quarter of a<br>million dollars and a deposit to get<br>into a house<br>because the well-being implications are<br>clear<br>new zealand for a long time has really<br>suffered with uh that under investment<br>in our infrastructure and our ability to<br>both<br>provide fix and maintain<br>the the<br>network assets that really keep us going<br>and i think we need to consider as well<br>what we do differently in that space our<br>analysis of infrastructure across the<br>country<br>and internationally has shown that new<br>zealand has under-invested relative to<br>our international peers over a number of<br>years uh we've invested at a rate uh<br>below the likes of the us certainly<br>below canada and australia and a touch<br>below the uk as well and it shows uh in<br>wellington we have pooh every now and<br>then running down the streets we have uh<br>hospitals uh you know which which are<br>and disrepair schools as well and i<br>guess we must ask ourselves how we let<br>ourselves get to that position how did<br>we not figure out that things were<br>breaking around us until we put a media<br>spotlight on it and it suggested<br>importantly going forward we must have a<br>much we must have a much better focus on<br>uh asset management<br>because as we've seen<br>and as dominic's pointed out the supply<br>of land and the supply of of<br>housing becomes secondary to that supply<br>of land and actually being able to do<br>something with that land change its use<br>around is critical yet at the moment we<br>are spending most of our money when it<br>comes to network infrastructure on asset<br>maintenance and repairs we're not<br>actually putting a huge amount into<br>additions and it does really highlight<br>leilani's point around the need to<br>better fund our infrastructure i do want<br>to make make a point around supply and<br>demand and note that although we all see<br>nearly 50 000 consents a year in the<br>headlines and talk about how much<br>building we're doing we in our mind at<br>infometrics do highlight that we're<br>probably only just right now this year<br>starting to build uh more than we<br>are needing to that huge increase in<br>supply is important but relative to<br>where we've previously been we've<br>underbuilt for over a decade we're only<br>now starting to get into a better<br>position and as uh politicians of both<br>sides have often made the point you<br>cannot live in a dwelling consent you<br>can only live in a dwelling and in our<br>estimates we're still a few years away<br>from actually getting things in a better<br>position uh by that time we will likely<br>have uh more pressures coming on to the<br>housing market so uh the point around<br>there being no silver bullet from<br>leilani was very well made and and my<br>submission there would be that we should<br>throw the kitchen sink in it<br>just finally i want to discuss why uh<br>housing actually matters dominic touched<br>on this from a well-being point of view<br>but i think it is important to go to a<br>very basic level uh for for new<br>zealanders that if you don't have a home<br>uh that is comfortable if you don't have<br>uh something that that you can go to<br>sleep in at night you aren't going to be<br>a very productive member of society<br>you're not going to worry about going to<br>work and being your productive best<br>you've had a rubbish night's sleep<br>you're not comfortable you're cold and<br>miserable so really<br>homes and housing does set the<br>foundation for new zealanders and we<br>know that those at the bottom end have<br>been left behind since 2016 lower<br>quartile rents have increased by 34 but<br>medians have only increased 29. so we<br>know that squeeze at the lower end has<br>come through quite clearly now with 25<br>000 new zealand households on the<br>waiting list and as we move forward that<br>difficulty that we find particularly for<br>young new zealanders becomes a huge<br>intergenerational<br>challenge where we've said we've made<br>decisions as a country<br>that young people will be screwed over<br>on the housing market as we go forward<br>that is the decision that new zealand<br>has made<br>and it does suggest we need to rethink<br>all policies that we have on the books<br>and i'll leave in and the point that<br>dominic has very well isolated in the<br>point that i made at the start is around<br>that the difficulty when it comes to<br>housing relates mostly now to the<br>deposit requirement and i remember quite<br>fondly my grandfather uh late<br>grandfather noting the potential of<br>government support back when he was<br>young state advances corporation the<br>capitalization of<br>child benefit and similar at the moment<br>i will save my own kiwisaver i get a<br>thousand dollars<br>a year uh sorry a thousand dollars at<br>start and 500 a year from the government<br>uh chump change really compared to what<br>other support has been seen previously<br>in new zealand we do need to rethink<br>that entire model the entire ladder and<br>the entire amount of state support that<br>we provide because for too long it's<br>been focused on subsidising the<br>continued rollover of housing through<br>the accommodation supplement and similar<br>we haven't built enough state homes we<br>haven't used the crown's balance sheet<br>to actually invest properly in<br>infrastructure and maintain the basic<br>bones of new zealand we are paying the<br>price for it unless we make those<br>changes now we will continue to suffer<br>and young new zealanders will be locked<br>out of that future increasingly thank<br>you<br>thank you very much<br>so one of the key themes which comes<br>across all presentations is the supply<br>of housing and coming back to the supply<br>of land<br>and<br>my question is<br>the recent legislative uh changes the<br>changes to try and increase capacity to<br>dwell in the major urban areas to what<br>extent is that going to alleviate things<br>or or<br>is it not<br>we know that many councils haven't<br>complied with national policy statements<br>on urban developments um<br>you know<br>what<br>what can be done to increase this land<br>supply what are the next uh steps so<br>uh dominic do you want to go first<br>followed by leilani<br>yeah and i think that'll be a good<br>combination i'll talk to the sort of<br>where are we on the spectrum and i'll<br>let leilani talk about what could<br>actually drive a difference um actually<br>the answer frank is we don't know um<br>there's<br>a number of years ago there were some<br>metrics generated on um sort of relative<br>availability of land but they've sort of<br>fallen into disuse<br>so<br>i'm on i'm chairing a housing technical<br>working group which is a collaboration<br>between ministry of housing and urban<br>development reserve bank of new zealand<br>and the treasury and one of our key<br>research topics is to<br>is to<br>try to understand you know i mentioned<br>that in reality we're somewhere between<br>this world of<br>fixed land supply and a world of<br>abundant land supply and we're somewhere<br>in the middle and different parts of new<br>zealand will be in different places<br>and i'd really like to get a metric of<br>where we are on that spectrum<br>and where different parts of new zealand<br>are<br>and then secondly i'd like to um do<br>further research on how far that<br>spectrum can shift<br>um my sense<br>is that uh is that actually<br>it can shift but it's slow really slow<br>and more institutional than simply you<br>know let's build this piece of<br>infrastructure here it's it's deep down<br>in the in the institutions um<br>of the nation but<br>that's my sense let me hand over to<br>leilani to give give more of a sense on<br>it is a big question in and of itself<br>and it's multifaceted i suppose in terms<br>of answers i think um i think one of the<br>things that the rma acts trying to do is<br>actually what is the plan and what is<br>the what does the plan for our cities<br>and our regions need to look like to<br>support future generations and<br>the population growth<br>and that's not that sounds easy to do<br>but it's actually not because it does<br>also need there for you know the number<br>of partners to come together to to sort<br>that out if i kind of reflect on my<br>experience in in new south wales because<br>for me coming to new zealand nine months<br>ago there were some elements that i was<br>recognising in the challenges and issues<br>that we are having here<br>that<br>you know resonated with me from when i<br>joined the new south wales government<br>about 12-10 years ago<br>so similarly infrastructure deficit<br>after 16 years of non-investment um<br>things the issues that brad raised in<br>his talk um<br>housing affordability going up<br>system not really you know<br>some livers in the system not quite set<br>up and strong enough<br>to support the ambitious agenda that<br>government had which was to address<br>housing affordability and infrastructure<br>one of the things that they did was they<br>started to look at how do they support<br>regional and urban planning what is<br>needed um where is it needed where do<br>people want to live work and play<br>and so those factors came into saying<br>well then and then what what do we<br>actually do to address that<br>um and so at the moment we<br>we don't quite house that baseline<br>um so we have a number of tools like<br>we're getting money to get together<br>we're getting a you know planning acts<br>and everything um<br>being amended and addressed<br>to um to work out<br>to make it easier uh once we get to<br>figure out what we have to do to make<br>that happen but we still don't quite<br>understand or have a have a clearer<br>picture at quite transparent levels<br>where<br>where people want to live work and play<br>um<br>and what therefore do we need to<br>facilitate in terms of infrastructure<br>and then what does that mean in terms of<br>housing and what does that mean in terms<br>of<br>um do we<br>intensify or do we go out and spread so<br>there's a there's a lot in there and i'm<br>not really giving you any direct or<br>short answers on it<br>but i think that what we have is that<br>some some pillars that need to be<br>delivered and i agree with brad it's<br>going to take some time to get those<br>things in place<br>before we can actually see what's<br>possible<br>thank you<br>i guess just standing there and i will<br>be a bit more definitive and and very<br>brief i i think the changes we've made<br>recently uh are very much a step in the<br>right direction and importantly starts<br>to change our frame of reference because<br>our prior settings our prior laws had a<br>very hands-off approach it was you can<br>develop but there are constraints and<br>and sort of how you develop what we<br>don't care about but there are settings<br>and frameworks in place recently though<br>we've said actually no we're more<br>permissive we're a bit more forthright<br>the country as a whole through our<br>political leaders are saying yes build<br>build don't don't not build build go go<br>on and do it and in fact for those of<br>you who didn't want to build sorry your<br>choice has gone because your property<br>rights at current are impinging on<br>people's future property rights and<br>there is more fairness over generations<br>that need to be introduced so i think<br>that's important because i do think it<br>starts to shift the psyche we're now in<br>a position where we're saying yes to<br>things more than we're trying to find<br>reasons not to go ahead but that does<br>need to continue and i speak<br>particularly in the local government<br>sector where indeed in my mind the<br>incentives still aren't strong enough to<br>do it because for a new development uh<br>you go along to a council and and it's<br>not often that you uh necessarily find<br>someone with a bottle of champagne<br>saying you want to build let's go let's<br>let's let's have fun<br>and importantly that's because again for<br>a council additional work yes means<br>eventually additional income but<br>importantly additional expenses to start<br>with and that focus like i said from an<br>infrastructure point of view has been<br>very very skewed towards maintaining<br>what we've got because we let it get so<br>run down for such a long time that we<br>cannot easily fund expansion and so it<br>does suggest that alongside the changes<br>we've made to infrastructure funding<br>recently we need to go further and again<br>i start to ask if we need to be much<br>more forthright instead of<br>financing uh you know for some large<br>developments<br>the taxes that that people have have<br>paid in recent times and people will pay<br>in the future could well allow us to get<br>ahead of the ball if we are courageous<br>brad<br>i'd like to go back to you again to to<br>continue this<br>my concern is uh local government uh<br>funding of infrastructure um<br>it doesn't seem to be happening at a<br>speed<br>that we would expect and and so my<br>question to you is is what can be done<br>to to speed that up um<br>and and get some momentum in this space<br>oh i think a lot i think at the moment<br>we also probably need to recognize the<br>temporal issues that we face around the<br>country there is a lot of stuff going on<br>and we simply can't do it all we're<br>pushing up prices what i do suggest<br>though is we need to have a much better<br>focus on prioritization economics is<br>about scarcity we know there's only so<br>much resource in a certain given period<br>of time to do stuff what is it that new<br>zealand decides is the important thing<br>to pay for right now is it sports<br>stadiums convention centers and similar<br>is it hospitals or schools is it roading<br>is it apartment blocks is it office<br>blocks we don't know we make no<br>decisions and importantly we<br>have not in my mind put the right sort<br>of pricing incentives<br>in there because the pricing metrics<br>matter but going forward i think as well<br>as that you sort of see uh the<br>difficulties that we face you you look<br>at um the the challenges that local<br>government has also from a purely<br>political point of view now economists<br>don't often<br>touch on the political view but<br>realistically we must remember it and so<br>i think the the direction setting that<br>central government has provided is<br>important<br>but there is an increasing need in my<br>mind that if the government takes uh the<br>money from local government in the form<br>of gst in the form of building consent<br>fees and and somewhere over time there<br>is a need to remit some of that back uh<br>to find a better funding stream than we<br>currently have at the moment we uh<br>the government provides a subsidy for<br>roads but if a local council wants to<br>fund some water pipes themselves or any<br>other sort of infrastructure sorry<br>that's on you we are not in my mind<br>having a full discussion about the<br>financing that could be done i think the<br>infrastructure financing uh that came<br>through in 2020 is an important step in<br>the right direction more of that please<br>thank you<br>so we've got six minutes left and<br>i'm going to allocate you two minutes<br>each and and i've got two questions for<br>you to answer<br>um<br>in your two minutes so<br>what's the most important thing to be<br>done in the infrastructure space going<br>forward<br>question number one and question number<br>two<br>what else is is your priority what's<br>your first priority in um<br>leading to a an improved housing market<br>and improved housing outcomes for new<br>zealand citizens<br>so we'll start with you dominic<br>oh if you don't mind i'll start with the<br>second question just in case i run out<br>of my two minutes but it's it's the tax<br>system<br>so the tax system in new zealand<br>favors ownership of assets that yield<br>capital gain rather than<br>taxable income<br>housing really firmly fits into that<br>category<br>um<br>i'm concerned about the equity<br>considerations there because those<br>locked out of the housing market don't<br>access those those uh tax benefits while<br>those who do have capital access the tax<br>benefits<br>secondly i think that's again in a in a<br>restricted land supply world<br>what we expect is that tax benefits for<br>housing manifest in higher land prices<br>so i think changing it there would would<br>affect land prices more than more than<br>rents will supply<br>infrastructure only point i'll make is i<br>think i think brad's right that this<br>needs to be a centralized<br>effort<br>so basically if you fix up you know<br>availability of land in one part of new<br>zealand what will happen is people will<br>flood to that part and quickly<br>exhaust that availability of land so it<br>really does need to be a nationwide<br>effort um so that we don't get this<br>cross city sort of equilibrium<br>so i guess my i'm going to take some<br>liberties on the infrastructure one<br>because i think there's two for me there<br>is that<br>coordinated planning um aspect which is<br>related to what tom's uh what um john's<br>just talked about<br>uh but i think we can have all the plans<br>and we can have a little enabling uh<br>legislation and access and everything<br>but if we don't have the capacity to<br>actually make it happen<br>then it's all for naught so i think<br>there needs to be this<br>now<br>while we're getting all the other things<br>sorted some real focus on how we're<br>going to attract the skills the<br>capability and capacity and experience<br>to actually deliver and to position<br>ourselves to be ahead<br>rather than catch up which is the point<br>that brad raised<br>um so in terms of housing and what's my<br>priority um at the moment it's just<br>getting those reforms the work on the<br>reform management act through at a very<br>um to look at the the the infrastructure<br>i i think we need to have asset<br>management planning going forward uh and<br>looking back and and the ability<br>probably for the infrastructure<br>commission rather than taking everyone's<br>capital plans and sort of noting them to<br>be much more directional and say no<br>we don't need these resources right this<br>second in this area we need to redeploy<br>our resources into<br>pipes or whatever it might be in<br>taranaki because that's where we see the<br>greatest need and also therefore the<br>funding that's attached that from<br>government<br>i think in terms of priorities i i'd<br>agree with dominic in terms of the tax<br>system i feel like at the moment uh we<br>are screwing over younger new zealanders<br>and we are increasing the wealth gaps as<br>we move forward new zealanders will only<br>be able to get into property if they<br>inherit it going into the future and for<br>those families that don't already have<br>property they will continue to be locked<br>out we either face that problem front on<br>and soon or we wreak<br>the havoc that we continue to see and<br>exacerbate the challenges for future<br>thank you very much<br>so um we've made a lot of progress there<br>are still issues in play i<br>put on the table this this whole<br>discussion about uh the replacement the<br>resource management act<br>is it coming fast enough<br>is it uh dealing adequately with the<br>challenges i think i think that's<br>another further challenge<br>for us<br>there's lots of questions come through<br>on the slider we haven't been able to uh<br>get to them all but<br>it does seem that the<br>supply chain issues are exacerbating the<br>problems that we're facing in the short<br>run and and one of the questions is how<br>soon we will get through to the other<br>side<br>of that um<br>the other issue that's coming up is the<br>current<br>lending requirements<br>associated with the the banking system<br>your interpretation of the recent<br>finance legislation<br>and i wonder whether dominic i'll give<br>you the chance for uh for a final<br>observation on that matter<br>yeah i think i um agreed with the way<br>the reserve bank um looked at this i<br>think those lending requirements can<br>have a fairly transitory effect on on<br>housing markets if they are at all i i<br>think the real reason that house prices<br>have started falling and the fallen over<br>december and january is that there was a<br>really sharp lift in interest rates<br>around september that's about the normal<br>timing in new zealand we've seen it<br>before big change in interest rates you<br>see a shift in the housing market and<br>it's it's coming to pass<br>um<br>yeah i think<br>thanks<br>thank you very much thank you to the<br>three of you for your contributions<br>today very helpful and we look forward<br>to this uh conversation continuing over<br>the coming months and hopefully better<br>outcomes in infrastructure<br>and housing markets i'll hand it back to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
