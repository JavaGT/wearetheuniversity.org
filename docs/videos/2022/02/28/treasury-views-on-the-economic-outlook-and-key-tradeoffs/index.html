carolee mclesh<br>she heads new zealand's treasury as<br>secretary and chief executive comes from<br>a background leading treasury functions<br>in australia and earlier in her career<br>had worked in washington dc at the world<br>bank<br>also at the international red cross and<br>at boston consulting group so a long<br>distinguished career<br>we now hand over to you carolee and<br>we'll see if the technology works and<br>thank you uh thank you very much<br>and tennokoto katoa<br>thank you for the the opportunity to<br>join you today and uh and to our host at<br>the university of waikato for bringing<br>us together it's a great occasion<br>i will just move to sharing my screen<br>presentation<br>now can you see that<br>yes<br>very good so<br>this morning i would like to make a few<br>observations on the economy which has<br>been resilient thanks to the strong<br>economic and health response to covert<br>but we are seeing<br>some shorter-term issues around capacity<br>inflation as well as longer-term issues<br>including a higher debt position<br>so how do we address these what are the<br>trade-offs we face and three goals of<br>fiscal policy<br>improving living standards macroeconomic<br>stability and fiscal sustainability<br>so so with those questions in mind<br>what i'd like to do is outline some of<br>the three big choices<br>that new zealand faces around fiscal<br>policy<br>so let's start with the economy and how<br>the treasury's seeing that we're now in<br>year three of the pandemic<br>covert 19 has caused severe disruption<br>in some sectors and for some businesses<br>and people<br>but overall the economy has proven<br>resilient to date<br>we've seen unprecedented volatility and<br>quarterly gdp<br>as you can see here but overall the<br>level of economic activity is now<br>starting to approach break over trend<br>and it's also stronger than in many<br>other advanced economies<br>government spending monetary policy have<br>played central roles in this resilience<br>among the really remarkable aspects of<br>the covert 19 downturn is the nature of<br>the supply shocks<br>lockdowns shut both production and<br>consumption in many industries and<br>subsequent catch-up production has not<br>been possible in the same way as<br>catch-up demand<br>in addition the availability of workers<br>has been impacted by border restrictions<br>global supply chains have been severely<br>disrupted which is constraining<br>businesses ability to meet demand<br>but the resilience of the economy and<br>the tightness of supply are especially<br>evident in labor markets so we've seen<br>unemployment under utilization at the<br>low pre-pandemic levels across all<br>ethnicities as well as for women and<br>youth<br>although existing disparities do remain<br>importantly participation in the labor<br>force is held up unlike some other<br>advanced countries border restrictions<br>have contributed to the tight labour<br>market as industries experiencing skills<br>shortages have been less able to access<br>international workers<br>but in some cases water restrictions<br>have cushioned the blow to the labor<br>market<br>for example while retail accommodation<br>experienced some of the highest falls in<br>uh in uh employment in the two years to<br>last december this is offset by the<br>falls and working holiday visa holders<br>it comprises about a quarter of the jobs<br>not in a combination of food services<br>so resilient demand combined with<br>interrupted supply has brought<br>inflationary pressures<br>inflation has risen overseas for similar<br>reasons and global inflation is also<br>impacting new zealand<br>with fuel prices being the greatest<br>driver of inflation as you can see here<br>at the onset of curved 19 central banks<br>in new zealand and overseas reduced<br>interest rates<br>this supported consumption and<br>employment and it also boosted asset<br>prices exacerbating wealth inequalities<br>between those with<br>and without assets<br>with inflation on the rise central banks<br>in new zealand and overseas have either<br>started lifting interest rates or signal<br>that they will and this will have a<br>dampening effect on asset prices<br>in new zealand we've already seen the<br>housing market start to slow which we're<br>forecast to continue<br>we're expecting inflation to peak in<br>march 22 and ease over the coming years<br>as conditions normalize<br>while the economy over overall has been<br>surprisingly resilient covert 19 has<br>driven some real shifts in the economy's<br>structure<br>some of which have fueled inflation as<br>relative prices change<br>you can see here a breakdown of economic<br>growth that shows government consumption<br>playing a really strong role in<br>supporting demand<br>residential investment and to a lesser<br>extent private consumption have also<br>grown strongly supported by rising house<br>prices<br>imports exports or services have fallen<br>dramatically of course alongside the<br>lack of international travel and so<br>businesses that are reliant on overseas<br>tourists or students are really<br>struggling<br>new zealanders have also substituted<br>away from services into consuming<br>durable goods<br>people are buying new cars and kitchens<br>instead of taking their overseas<br>holidays<br>and that same switch from services to<br>goods is happening globally which is<br>boosting commodity prices our key<br>exporters are experiencing uh high<br>prices for their products and in terms<br>of trade are at their highest in more<br>than 100 years<br>consumer spending we also see shifts<br>there from in-person to online and the<br>increase in working from home has<br>changed consumption patterns within<br>cities<br>but despite all this disruption and all<br>these really significant shifts we don't<br>see evidence of widespread scarring to<br>date<br>and some of the longer-term trends that<br>new zealand has has faced have persisted<br>such as growing terms of trade and low<br>productivity growth<br>today we're facing into rising cases of<br>the omicron variant it's disrupting both<br>demand and supply through worker<br>absences and individual efforts to avoid<br>illness rather than by lockdowns<br>our analysis at treasury suggests that<br>omnicron will reduce march quarter gdp<br>by about one and a half to percentage<br>points<br>however international experience<br>suggests that omnicron waves peak<br>quickly and that economic activity<br>rebounds relatively rapidly<br>so pandemic has shown us time and again<br>how quickly the outlook can shame can<br>change<br>main uncertainty continues to be covered<br>19 but new zealand remains in a strong<br>position to withstand some of the risks<br>and challenges ahead<br>with among the most robust economic<br>performance in advanced countries<br>through the pandemic but also<br>low levels of government debt relative<br>to uh relative to peers so that takes me<br>to<br>my next part of this presentation fiscal<br>policy<br>so fiscal policy has played a central<br>role in the resilience of the economy<br>through the pandemic to date<br>wage subsidy other economic supports<br>have helped keep people and jobs and<br>businesses running funding enabled an<br>effective health response and increases<br>to benefits and other welfare spend have<br>supported vulnerable people<br>new zealand had one of the largest and<br>also the most timely fiscal responses<br>among event among advanced economies<br>this was made easier by a crown balance<br>sheet a strong current crown balance<br>sheet entering into the pandemic<br>support which was supported by a firm<br>commitment across successive governments<br>over many years to fiscal sustainability<br>debt has risen dramatically although the<br>increase is uh close to the oecd average<br>and far less than originally predicted<br>as you can see here<br>thanks largely to the resilience of the<br>economy<br>back at the start of the pandemic<br>treasury's view was that the choices for<br>fiscal policy were relatively clear<br>given the extreme nature of the shock a<br>swift and strong fiscal report response<br>was required<br>the risks of providing too little<br>support when it was needed far<br>outweighed providing too much support if<br>not needed<br>but looking ahead the choices for fiscal<br>policy entail a more considered balance<br>across the three key goals of fiscal<br>policy<br>improving living standards<br>macroeconomic stability and fiscal<br>sustainability<br>so as mentioned at the start i wanted to<br>highlight three areas where governments<br>based choices in setting fiscal policy<br>that we believe are particularly<br>relevant for the period ahead and noting<br>also that they're not exhausted of<br>course<br>so these are the weight that's placed on<br>macroeconomic stability versus other<br>living standards<br>objectives prudent debt versus foreign<br>investment<br>and fiscal versus other government<br>policies<br>i'll outline briefly the ways in which<br>treasury aims to surface the trade-offs<br>that are inherent in these choices in<br>our advice to ministers who are of<br>course ultimately responsible for<br>weighing the options and making<br>decisions<br>so first<br>weight place on macroeconomic stability<br>objectives so that the main focus of<br>fiscal policy is raising revenue<br>allocating spending in a way that lifts<br>living standards<br>fiscal policy enables short-term<br>long-term investments in schools<br>hospitals roads social environmental<br>services and essential infrastructure<br>for example<br>macroeconomic conditions such as<br>inflation state of the labor america<br>exchange rates they also matter in<br>setting fiscal policy but they're only<br>one factor and need to be balanced<br>against other objectives<br>governments have choices about balancing<br>macroeconomic conditions now with<br>shaping long-term well-being later<br>main top policy tool for managing<br>economic cycles is monetary policy<br>fiscal policy has an important<br>supporting role though particularly<br>through automatic stabilizers that help<br>to make economic cycles less pronounced<br>and as we've seen through the pandemic<br>fiscal policy can also be really<br>effective in supporting living standards<br>by holding up activity in the face of<br>significant shocks<br>and by targeting those who are most<br>affected<br>but that said an excessive short-term<br>stabilization focus for discretionary<br>fiscal policy could lead to<br>frequent changes in spending and tax<br>program which which in turn could impose<br>microeconomic costs<br>moreover given various lags that are<br>inherent in discretionary fiscal policy<br>outside emergency spending there's also<br>a real risk that attempts at<br>stabilization actually end up<br>exacerbating the economic cycle<br>fiscal policy can of course contribute<br>to inflation for any given level of<br>activity physical stimulus will add to<br>demand and that puts pressure on prices<br>a few important points of clarification<br>though first demand is boosted by fiscal<br>stimulus not just spending we need to<br>look at revenue also<br>second the extent of any effect on<br>stimulus on inflation will depend on the<br>nature and the timing of spending<br>and finally we need to look at the<br>supply side of the economy if an<br>increase in demand will accompany by an<br>increase in supply we would expect<br>growth not inflation<br>so what does this mean for fiscal policy<br>today when inflation is high while the<br>extent of fiscal stimulus has been very<br>large the treasury's last forecast show<br>fiscal tightening from june this year<br>with a return to surplus by 2024 and a<br>negative fiscal impulse from next year<br>onwards so that reflects the wind down<br>of economic supports that were temporary<br>by design<br>and also solid revenue growth<br>offset by significant allowances to<br>achieve government's budget objectives<br>which include tax on climate change and<br>uh and health reform<br>economic supports are still available<br>through the pandemic but they're more<br>targeted now and aimed at avoiding<br>scarring rather than the broader support<br>for demand that was provided earlier<br>net effect is that fiscal policy is<br>dampening pressure on inflation in the<br>coming years<br>uh while the treasury's forecasting<br>inflation to remain above the rbnz<br>target range through 2022 for the next<br>couple of years fiscal policy is not the<br>main factor driving this<br>now of course there are options about<br>the speed the extent of fiscal<br>tightening<br>interactions with monetary policy are<br>relevant to these choices<br>any government spending is expected to<br>add to demand relative to not spending<br>and will require a greater monetary<br>policy response than otherwise<br>fiscal multipliers are also higher when<br>rates are low<br>but with interest rates close to the<br>effective lower bound fiscal policy may<br>support monetary policy in normalizing<br>and enable further headroom for future<br>downturns<br>ultimately the balance of these<br>macroeconomic and microeconomic<br>objectives are choices for the<br>government of the day<br>and our role at the treasury is to help<br>inform these decisions by making clear<br>those trade-offs<br>now the second<br>choice that i wanted to speak about was<br>between prudent debt and prudent<br>investment<br>so concept of prudent debt was<br>introduced in new zealand's legislation<br>through the fiscal responsibility act<br>back in 1994<br>part of a series of public finance<br>reforms that are internationally<br>renowned for promoting fiscal discipline<br>and performance<br>the the authors didn't define prudence<br>and instead they gave governments the<br>flexibility to interpret the principles<br>of responsible fiscal management in the<br>economic context of the time<br>so there's really no magic number for<br>optimal debt<br>as treasury advised back in 1994 it<br>varies with the circumstances<br>our view at the treasury today is that<br>today's level and trajectory of debt is<br>brilliant and consistent with the<br>principles of responsible fiscal<br>management<br>fiscal framework is enduring but um but<br>the context has changed<br>we examine<br>three main factors in determining<br>prudent debt so debt sustainability<br>market access and the welfare or<br>well-being vex offer of debt<br>and you know just looking at context<br>network network ground debt reached its<br>peak of 55<br>of gdp in 1992<br>that was shortly before the uh the fra<br>fiscal responsibility act was passed and<br>at that time a long-term objective of<br>net debt at 20 to 30 percent of gdp was<br>established as you can see here<br>you can also see here just how different<br>the context was at that time with the<br>crown facing negative net worth low<br>ratings credit ratings and uh much<br>higher interest rates<br>and by contrast<br>as the treasury advises now on<br>post pandemic debt targets<br>debt servicing sustainability and market<br>access considerations are completely<br>different<br>the decline that you can see here in<br>debt costs reflects a uh a longer term<br>trend of falling neutral interest rates<br>and the result is that interest rates<br>are lower than growth rates<br>which is a condition of considerable<br>importance to fiscal policy it reduces<br>the wealth of welfare costs of debt and<br>it creates more creates more physical<br>headroom<br>now<br>we can't be certain that these favorable<br>debt dynamics will continue indefinitely<br>in the near term of course rates are<br>expected to rise as monetary policy<br>normalizes but falling neutral interest<br>rates is a global trend it reflects uh<br>strong savings with investment driven by<br>and while not unanimous the general<br>consensus is that these long-term forces<br>are unlikely to reverse and neutral<br>interest rates will remain will remain<br>low<br>so so an important point that i'd like<br>to stress is that prudent debt is also<br>inextricably<br>linked with the concept of brilliant<br>investment which captures the welfare or<br>well-being effects of spending<br>while lower debt targets can enhance<br>short-term fiscal sustainability set too<br>low they risk ineffective inefficient<br>cuts in public investment or increases<br>in taxation that can reduce overall<br>well-being and conversely debt limits<br>that are set too high can impose costs<br>on future generations or lead to<br>wasteful spend<br>there is some evidence that investment<br>has been below prudent levels<br>uh te wahinga the new zealand<br>infrastructure commission have estimated<br>a historical infrastructure gap of 104<br>billion dollars<br>for many years new zealand's capital<br>intensity has been below the oecd<br>average and one of the drivers of poor<br>productivity performance<br>higher rates of both private and public<br>investment are likely to be critical to<br>achieving objectives around new<br>zealand's long-standing challenges<br>such as housing climate change and<br>productivity<br>we too are closely related there's<br>international evidence that additional<br>public investment can catalyze private<br>investment<br>and increase certainty about the path of<br>public investment can also allow<br>industries like construction to plan and<br>prepare for higher levels of activity<br>but striking the right balance between<br>prudent debt and investment it depends<br>critically on the rigor<br>and the enforcement of public investment<br>disciplines<br>more credible the investment framework<br>the better the ability to identify<br>value from money proposals and then the<br>less there is a need for blunt and<br>restrictive debt targets<br>without these disciplines there is a<br>risk that looser debt targets could lead<br>to baseball spend<br>so choices on prudent debt and prudent<br>investment also require close attention<br>to rules on operating spending<br>the treasury's long-term fiscal<br>statement<br>shows that if historical trends continue<br>the greatest risks to debt<br>sustainability are from rising<br>superannuation costs and health<br>expenditure as you can see here<br>ensuring that operating expenses are<br>covered by operating revenue helps to<br>ensure intergenerational equity<br>it means that the current generation<br>pays for its own consumption and debt<br>can be used for investments that provide<br>returns to future generations<br>treasury is currently examining how<br>fiscal indicators can set the right<br>incentives for both brilliant debt and<br>investment<br>for example in measures of net debt the<br>treatment of monetary policy financial<br>assets and crown entities can affect<br>the incentives on the direction of<br>fiscal policy and also how resources are<br>allocated<br>and what's clear is that there's there's<br>no one perfect fiscal target<br>any targets need to be considered along<br>a comprehensive suite of fiscal<br>performance measures that are embedded<br>in a broader and rigorous fiscal<br>framework<br>that takes me to the third<br>trade-off which is<br>the weight placed on fiscal versus other<br>policies so government has a wide set of<br>tools available<br>fiscal regulatory social policies and<br>and careful consideration is needed on<br>which tools to use when<br>i touch briefly on some of the<br>interactions of monetary and fiscal<br>policy earlier but more broadly in<br>setting fiscal policy we always need to<br>check whether alternatives can achieve<br>the policy objective more effectively<br>in many instances and particularly where<br>affordability and macroeconomic concerns<br>are high non-fiscal levers can provide<br>more attractive options for achieving<br>government's objectives<br>look i think new zealand's climate<br>policy response provides an example of<br>assessing healthy school and other<br>policy tools can be leveraged alongside<br>one another<br>global climate change represents uh<br>what's been termed as the greatest<br>market failure the world has ever seen<br>those who emit greenhouse gases have not<br>paid for the full cost of the emissions<br>and correcting this through price<br>signals on emissions is our first best<br>solution and uh and one that we stand<br>strongly behind at the treasury<br>but there are<br>reasons why emissions pricing cannot be<br>the only tool in our climate policy<br>toolbox<br>while emissions pricing corrects for one<br>key failure there are more to be<br>addressed such as imperfect information<br>asymmetric information in complete<br>markets<br>consumer behavior<br>and<br>in addition at present the emissions<br>trading scheme our core emissions<br>pricing instrument in new zealand<br>doesn't cover all sectors and our<br>businesses in the economy<br>so given this<br>price mechanisms are necessary but not<br>enough complementary regulatory other<br>non-spending measures alongside value<br>for money spending measures are needed<br>to achieve our emissions goals at<br>minimum cost<br>moreover complementary measures may be<br>used to support equity in a climate<br>transition or achieve other social goals<br>ultimately our choice of how to use<br>these levers comes down to assessing a<br>number of trade-offs and requires<br>consideration of<br>efficiency equity broader distributional<br>concerns from<br>economic perspectives but also social<br>cultural and environmental perspectives<br>and the treasury's living standards<br>framework helps us to assess some of<br>those<br>trade-offs so in closing then while the<br>economy has uh proven resilient to date<br>uh covert response policies have<br>involved some really tough trade-offs<br>as we as we continue to navigate the<br>pandemic and look ahead to recovery<br>choices and trade-offs for fiscal policy<br>will persist<br>they require a considered balance across<br>the goals of improving living standards<br>macroeconomic stability and fiscal<br>sustainability<br>there are no simple answers here we need<br>to weigh<br>costs and benefits<br>we don't know yet where the next shock<br>will be but we must evaluate the lessons<br>from the pandemic response to help us<br>navigate what will be inevitable shocks<br>and changes ahead<br>we also seek to understand the effects<br>of economic policy not just on the<br>fiscal and traditional economic measures<br>as i've mainly focused on today but also<br>broader measures of living standards and<br>later this year the treasury is going to<br>release its first well-being report<br>which is a new stewardship requirement<br>under the public finance act that uh<br>that asks us to examine the state the<br>trends and the underlying drivers of<br>wellbeing in new zealand and we look<br>forward to engaging with<br>academics others in the economic<br>profession hopefully members of the<br>audience here on this important work<br>so thank you i will close there and cure<br>thank you and some fascinating looks<br>back particularly of the contrast<br>between now and the mid-90s where we<br>went through so many policy changes<br>can i<br>start i guess with the reflection there<br>are a lot of challenges coming at us and<br>there are also a lot of reforms in play<br>for those sitting outside<br>of the the mechanics of of government<br>what is the role of treasury in<br>doing the cost benefit analysis and<br>weighing the trade-offs you've really<br>dwelt in those trade-offs and how is<br>that happening now with simply so many<br>different things in play versus analysis<br>happening on<br>reforms with within one industry house<br>how's treasury's role in that<br>yeah yeah thanks thanks for that<br>question and there certainly is a very<br>large reform agenda as well as the<br>response to the pandemic and treasury as<br>a central agency is really involved in<br>uh in almost every aspect of that in<br>some way but i think importantly<br>it's a responsibility of agencies who<br>are preparing policy proposals to<br>to really develop the analysis on those<br>choices the trade-offs the costs and the<br>benefits<br>treasury has a supporting role<br>and we uh prepare guidelines and<br>frameworks and we'll work with agencies<br>to uh to conduct those sorts of<br>assessments um but really uh<br>the responsibility lies where the<br>expertise also lies as well<br>uh treasury through the budget process<br>will have a really critical role in um<br>providing our assessment on um policy<br>proposals<br>and not doing bottom-up cost-benefit<br>analysis ourselves but um reviewing uh<br>what what the proposals are and analysis<br>that's been that's been done we provide<br>that second opinion advice to uh to to<br>to to government we also have a role<br>through um providing that second opinion<br>advice through the cabinet process for<br>regulatory proposals um or other funding<br>planning proposals<br>we are increasingly using our living<br>standards framework to<br>help assess um proposals that come<br>through so that we can<br>identify some of the trade-offs that i<br>spoke about<br>today and we also work with agencies to<br>encourage use to the living standards<br>framework as well as more traditional um<br>ways to assess policy choices and<br>trade-offs<br>okay thank you<br>i'm going to go to a question that's<br>come through from the audience so<br>the comment was that treasury had<br>previously advised that the reserve bank<br>should consider<br>broadening broadening the monetary<br>policy committee to allow academic<br>experts or others to serve is that a<br>current view of treasury or have you got<br>a view on that now<br>i'm sorry on the appointments of the<br>monetary policy committee of the<br>committee here<br>on the membership of the bank<br>so um you know we haven't given advice<br>on this recently but um but we haven't<br>changed our view and i'm aware that<br>there are you know appointment processes<br>that are underway so we wouldn't want to<br>comment on that<br>but no we haven't<br>no that's that's fine and that's one one<br>through from the audience can i then ask<br>another one<br>the<br>looking ahead particularly you've got<br>the living standards framework you've<br>touched on many things including climate<br>change and other issues<br>where do you see the best investments<br>being from a government point of view<br>that are going to meet<br>needs around commercial growth of the<br>economy but also the social and<br>environmental needs what are the what<br>are the items that you see are the<br>greatest opportunity for greater<br>investment over the next five years<br>oh um that's a great question and a very<br>broad one um there are there are many i<br>mean i think one of the biggest<br>transitions well without doubt one of<br>the biggest transitions ahead of the<br>country is climate change<br>and so investments that support um<br>climate resilient uh economy<br>and uh low emissions economy will be<br>absolutely critical i think there are<br>big opportunities as well as the costs<br>of transition um new zealand already has<br>great advantages in its<br>high use of renewable energy and a lot<br>of sustainable agricultural practices<br>uh and so you know that shift to um to<br>climate-friendly investments is one that<br>i just see is a big opportunity but it's<br>also an imperative and that will be<br>driving a lot of allocation of resources<br>in the economy<br>overall<br>i think there are also opportunities in<br>rebuilding and deepening our<br>international<br>connections uh we know that that's a<br>critical element of driving productivity<br>in uh in new zealand and as border<br>restrictions eat<br>there will be there will be many<br>opportunities that come from<br>strengthening those uh those channels<br>with the export markets<br>and uh also the exchange of people and<br>technologies and ideas that can support<br>uh support productivity and i guess the<br>final one that i'd highlight is just the<br>infrastructure<br>infrastructure investment<br>government has uh significantly<br>increased funding for uh for<br>infrastructure<br>um and uh i mentioned in in my remarks<br>the uh the the measures of the<br>infrastructure gap now infrastructure<br>you know the right projects can also<br>really drive productivity there's a lot<br>of work that's underway in coordinating<br>infrastructure programs and the<br>infrastructure commission of courses<br>is building up its<br>national infrastructure strategy to<br>really help focus<br>investments on where they can best lift<br>the productivity under the standards of<br>new zealanders<br>thank you caroly<br>another question that's come through<br>from the audience and it was<br>specifically about<br>whether and how treasury is thinking<br>about the potential of flow on shocks<br>from what's happening in europe at the<br>moment<br>tensions around russia and ukraine and i<br>might broaden that out to say<br>given the the pandemic shock that we've<br>been through over the last couple of<br>years there are obviously other things<br>that could be happening geopolitically<br>uh given the<br>the data you've shared with us today<br>around debt and resilience what's your<br>take on our preparedness for<br>other shocks or a potential sequence of<br>shocks over the next few years how do we<br>think about that or how does treasury<br>think about that<br>yeah thanks for the question i think<br>that's a great one<br>this is one of the things that we're<br>reflecting on as we as we consider how<br>to evaluate some of the lessons from the<br>pandemic is resilience how do we make<br>sure that<br>we<br>really capture<br>some of some of what we've learned and<br>ensure that we're ready for the next<br>shock which we know will happen and so<br>we've learned a lot about economic<br>supports and uh how to deliver those<br>within the treasury but also the<br>interactions of various um different<br>policies and the pandemic was health and<br>economic policy fiscal monetary policy<br>many more regulatory policies are<br>important but really trying to<br>understand those interactions will put<br>us in a better better uh stead for<br>whatever shots come next uh on ukraine<br>look this is um this is uh something<br>that uh a treasury economics team are<br>monitoring it's an issue that treasury<br>economics team are monitoring uh closely<br>the tensions present they do present a<br>risk to the global economic outlook and<br>we've seen some volatility in um in<br>global markets<br>um there's some risks around uh around<br>uh oil and and fuel prices and we've<br>already seen uh some of that uh<br>uh take it take effect um and uh you<br>know pretend more potential disruptions<br>to uh to supply chains<br>um which again may have uh impacts for<br>uh for inflation for the inflation<br>outlook so it's an issue that we're<br>monitoring um closely new zealand isn't<br>heavily exposed at this at this point<br>but um no it's it's something that will<br>continue to keep close to handsome<br>thank you<br>i'm going to ask another one from the<br>audience<br>you shared some data there around<br>changes in trade and drop-offs and<br>exports and imports and so on certainly<br>migration of people there was a question<br>that came through about<br>given the impacts of covert should the<br>government be considering should new<br>zealand be considering more national<br>production in case of uh rolling<br>pandemics rolling disruptions in the<br>supply chain over time<br>yeah and i think that comes to the uh<br>the previous question about uh economic<br>um resilience this is an element that um<br>that we in countries around the world<br>are considering we saw particularly the<br>early stages of the pandemic to some<br>really severe disruptions<br>um that uh that uh exposed i guess the<br>um<br>the the risks um that are inherent in um<br>in some of those international<br>connections so diversification of uh<br>supply chains and diversification of<br>markets is something um to to explore it<br>is one of the reflections on uh<br>from the pandemic so we're feeding that<br>into some of our work on longer term uh<br>resilience um you know there are always<br>trade-offs um no when there are some<br>short-term gains to be made from<br>focusing in on certain markets or<br>certain suppliers that's that makes it<br>challenging but we have learned that<br>that too much reliance can<br>can increase risk<br>thank you<br>and another one um perennial topic you<br>touched on the revenue side of the<br>equation<br>what's uh what thinking's being done<br>about tax at the moment taxes<br>as an incentive tax as a driver of<br>productivity and potentially and also as<br>a source of revenue to manage debt of<br>course<br>what's what's been happening within the<br>halls of treasury recently in the<br>discussions about tax<br>yeah so i mean tax of course that's<br>always an issue that treasury is uh<br>thinking about and um and doing some<br>work on the most significant work<br>recently was through the tax working<br>group a couple of years ago and um<br>proposals and responses by treasury at<br>the time really outline our thinking on<br>that i mean you can also see<br>our thinking in some of our work in the<br>um in the long term fiscal statement<br>which we uh released last year and<br>explored tax options to uh to address<br>some of the long-term fiscal<br>sustainability um challenges that uh<br>that we face<br>um back to my theme it is about<br>trade-offs um you know the um the the<br>benefits of higher taxes for<br>fiscal sustainability as opposed to some<br>of the welfare costs that can be uh<br>imposed and it really is one of the key<br>areas where um where policy comes down<br>to choices for government weighing up<br>those are those different factors but<br>our work is really trying to you know<br>outline the analysis on what the the<br>costs and benefits are of those choices<br>um and as i said the the most<br>significant what we've done recently on<br>that is um is summarized in our</p></main><footer
