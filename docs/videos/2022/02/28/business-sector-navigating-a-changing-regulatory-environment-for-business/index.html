businesses around the<br>country if you're in the primary sector<br>uh your prices are gangbusters and the<br>hardest thing you've got to do is find<br>the people to do the work to get your<br>product to market<br>similar story in construction although<br>that may change with the reserve bank's<br>efforts this last day or so and uh<br>they're they're signaling of a 3.4<br>ocr<br>then you have the tech sector who are<br>struggling to bring uh what we used to<br>what we might have used to call<br>manufacturing in a way but it's now very<br>much high-tech i.t and so on uh<br>struggling to get the people to continue<br>their growth<br>and then the sector that's done it<br>toughest at all and that's the services<br>sector and in particular people<br>providing human services tourism<br>education uh getting a haircut<br>hospitality and they are absolutely uh<br>struggling<br>some to the point of closing the<br>businesses either permanently or<br>temporarily and that's the nature of<br>this pandemic layout over the top though<br>the government has its own regulatory<br>reform agenda particularly in the<br>resource industries sector and climate<br>change and the environment and so on and<br>also in the labor market where they have<br>planned significant changes to unfold in<br>the next couple of years to help us<br>navigate this in this next session i<br>have three guests who know exactly what<br>they're talking about very knowledgeable<br>and right in this wheel house firstly<br>craig rennie who's economist and<br>director of public policy at the new<br>zealand council of trade unions<br>we have mike burrow who's the executive<br>director of the sustainable business<br>council and we'll follow them up with<br>brian chapel who's the deputy secretary<br>macroeconomics and growth at new zealand<br>treasury<br>so welcome gentlemen and we'll start<br>with you if we can craig i think you're<br>there yes there is uh and uh g'day to<br>you<br>what we'd like is from everybody is just<br>sort of five to seven minutes of laying<br>out your stall um the key points you<br>want to make and then we'll get to the<br>conversations and the questions uh where<br>we we get to talking about amongst<br>ourselves which i think is probably the<br>highest value part of the session so<br>craig welcome and uh fire into it<br>thank you steven for that introduction<br>um i hope you'll continue to be as kind<br>at the end of my speech<br>and i'd also like to thank waikato<br>university for providing with me the<br>opportunity to talk with you today<br>um we've been asked to talk about<br>navigating a changing regulatory<br>environment for businesses and for me<br>let's be clear all governments regulate<br>they regulate because they perceive a<br>problem in the economy or society that<br>requires rules they regulate to correct<br>the balance as professor vanda hayden<br>the chair in regulatory practice at<br>victoria university states<br>proper regulation is not about<br>restrictions or limitations but rather<br>about providing equal opportunity and<br>protecting individuals from harm<br>sometimes this works the creation of acc<br>was essentially the creation of a set of<br>regulations it means that those who have<br>accidents receive support and we don't<br>have ambulance chasing lawyers on tv new<br>zealand is arguably much better off as a<br>consequence<br>sometimes it doesn't work the leaky<br>homes crisis was caused by regulation<br>failure as mr joyce will tell you it's<br>cost the government 12 and a half<br>billion dollars to fix and will continue<br>to cost more in the future<br>poor regulation or the poor application<br>of regulations can cause real harm and<br>there are few areas of life that<br>regulation does not touch<br>from the quality of the air we breathe<br>to the nutrition of the food we eat to<br>the slightly more terminal 1973<br>crematorium regulations they are<br>ubiquitous<br>but they are necessary i haven't heard<br>what my fellow panelists might burrell<br>is going to say today but i would be<br>astonished if he didn't say that further<br>government action was necessary on<br>climate change<br>action is necessary because for too long<br>we thought that our atmosphere was just<br>a free good that didn't require<br>regulation<br>the concern that some of you may hold is<br>that now is not the time to be making<br>further changes to regulations that our<br>recovery from covert will be freshened<br>up if we just paired back rules that we<br>should be cognizant of the overall<br>burden of regulation<br>as my former boss brian chapel used to<br>tell me we should take a system-wide<br>view of regulation<br>whilst doing so we should not forget<br>that according to the world bank new<br>zealand is the best country in the world<br>to be a business with the most business<br>friendly regulations<br>in my view regulation is a tool it's a<br>tool to help you deliver the kind of<br>economy you want to see and to manage<br>poor behaviors the government's economic<br>plan calls for the building of a more<br>productive sustainable and inclusive<br>economy and its overall aim is to<br>improve the well-being of new zealanders<br>and their families<br>the ctu backs that aspiration as i would<br>i hope many of you here today<br>the volume of regulation or the level of<br>regulatory change provided is actually<br>pretty unimportant what is important is<br>that regulation effectively implemented<br>helps to deliver on that policy in<br>that's why it's right for the government<br>to be delivering on its agenda for<br>regulatory change in environment in<br>industrial relations<br>even with unemployment at record lows we<br>can still point to sectors where job<br>insecurity low wages poor terms and<br>conditions arrive where the costs of<br>competition are loaded onto workers and<br>where health and safety is not the<br>priority it should be<br>that's why fair pay agreements are<br>essential to deliver both better<br>workplaces and sectors more focused on<br>product innovation and higher<br>productivity that's what we see now in<br>both australia and germany that already<br>have sector-level bargaining<br>that's why social unemployment insurance<br>is essential both the ctu and businesses<br>union have endorsed the proposals<br>because there's an opportunity to build<br>a better way<br>much like we did with acc<br>according to motu wage scoring costs<br>workers 15 billion dollars and are lost<br>in a recession year<br>according to sierra employers number one<br>problem right now is a lack of access to<br>skills<br>we have a skills mismatching problem<br>that the current system creates and<br>entrenches<br>social insurance will provide better<br>opportunities for up skilling and career<br>transition and it will encourage the<br>sort of equitable structural change<br>missing from new zealand's economic<br>history it's exactly the more<br>dynamically of the market many<br>economists have called for<br>this is why the government's reforms<br>regulations around worker exploitation<br>are essential<br>some workers operate in a gray area<br>where they're treated like employees or<br>considered self-employed misclassified<br>workers miss out on basic employment<br>rights payment of at least the minimum<br>wage holidays paid leave and the right<br>to a proper process if fired are made<br>redundant<br>this harms workers it also puts a<br>disadvantage those businesses doing the<br>right thing<br>the race to the bottom just creates an<br>environment in which product and service<br>levels are of second order importance to<br>cost and it passes on the cost of that<br>regular lack of regulatory clarity to<br>others in the form of higher in-work<br>welfare and tax credits<br>now reasonable people can disagree about<br>what the government is doing but it's<br>been elected to deliver on its agenda<br>and that also means the delivery of<br>regulation that it believes will deliver<br>on that outcome<br>in my view the business community and<br>workers in new zealand have nothing to<br>fear and plenty to gain from these<br>changes<br>so how can businesses best navigate<br>these changes<br>my answer is engage<br>engage with workers and their<br>representatives to make the most of the<br>opportunities these changes will bring<br>an example here would be the high<br>performance high engagement work<br>commenced by christopher luxon at air<br>new zealand now being rolled out<br>elsewhere<br>working together with unions it<br>delivered higher output lower cost and a<br>safer company as mr luxem called it it<br>was about ending the punch and judy show<br>between workers and management<br>leading firms recognize that<br>understanding their regulatory<br>environment is as much a part of their<br>business as their product or service and<br>according to the 2020 ez and consumer<br>survey it's also increasingly part of<br>what customers and clients want to<br>that service said it was becoming<br>increasingly important for businesses to<br>ensure they are meeting their legal<br>employment standards and to have the<br>appropriate systems in place to ensure<br>our worker well-being<br>but let's go back to professor van der<br>hayden to end<br>as he said regulation is not about<br>restrictions or limitations it's about<br>providing equal opportunities and<br>protecting individuals from harm<br>the proposed changes to industrial<br>relations in new zealand help level the<br>playing field<br>they're also about reducing the harms<br>and rebalancing the costs that we see<br>from the current regulatory systems that<br>we have in place today<br>more importantly they're also about<br>delivering on the government's economic<br>goal of that more productive that more<br>sustainable and that more inclusive<br>economy<br>thank you<br>thank you very much craig<br>i'm sure there's much for discussion<br>there um one thing i do think we can<br>probably all agree on is the aspiration<br>um i've never doubted the aspiration on<br>both the left and right of the political<br>spectrum to deliver a more productive<br>and equitable economy uh for this<br>country the challenge is of course the<br>method by which is done which we will<br>discuss over the course of the next uh<br>odd uh they're 35 minutes 35.<br>let's go then to mike burrell uh who's<br>the executive director of the<br>sustainable business council and that's<br>of course related to business new<br>zealand uh mike uh i'm sure will have a<br>few things to say on what craig's said<br>but also is particularly interested in<br>the whole resource area our<br>environmental concerns and climate<br>change so mike g'day<br>thanks steven<br>well it come i think it won't cover any<br>surprise to anyone who's listening into<br>that today that i'll be looking at this<br>through a sustainable business leans to<br>start with the release tonight i just<br>really want to make four points um the<br>first one is that in many countries<br>including new zealand businesses are<br>leading the way on sustainability and<br>climate action so<br>sustainable businesses like the ones i<br>represent in the sustainable business<br>council have been moving from seeing<br>sustainability as a bolt-on something<br>that you do in addition to your core<br>business to seeing it as something that<br>should be built into your core business<br>strategy over the last five years and<br>we're seeing more of that tune up in<br>those business strategies so these<br>businesses see that it just it's just<br>good practice since sustainable business<br>is about foresight it's about looking<br>ahead to anticipate risk and opportunity<br>and then responding to those elements<br>that are material to your business<br>so this mainstream of mainstreaming of<br>sustainability is evident both<br>internationally and here domestically<br>and we see it across a broad range of<br>sectors but we're also seeing pressure<br>coming from within the private sector as<br>investors like blackrock begin to signal<br>that they'll disinvest from companies<br>that aren't sustainable as<br>as customers and uh clients begin to<br>demand more sustainable businesses as<br>credit rating agencies like moody's and<br>standard and poor's now front load their<br>conversations with companies with a<br>session on sustainability employment<br>risk<br>you see banks like westpac and others<br>who are developing sustainable finance<br>products and insurance companies like<br>iag and others who are beginning to<br>focus on climate adaptation so a lot of<br>the pressure on companies is coming<br>actually from within the private sector<br>itself and as we've seen in countries<br>like the uk it is the action from the<br>private sector that's having the most<br>significant impact on climate admissions<br>reduction and this is largely being led<br>by businesses themselves because they<br>see both the risk of not taking action<br>and of course the opportunity to adapt<br>into that new reality and the risk of<br>not taking a churn there and their<br>competitors taking it for them the<br>second point i wanted to make is uh that<br>we're currently in the midst of a very<br>major policy shift on climate action at<br>the point that uh the crane just made<br>before both globally and also here in<br>new zealand and it's an enormous amount<br>that's happening in terms of climate and<br>sustainability related regulation and<br>government policy and really what i<br>wanted to do is just<br>list a few of those things to give you<br>an idea of flavor just at the scale of<br>it so we've got the reform of the rma<br>we've got the outcomes of the climate<br>change commissions report which came out<br>last year and the government's response<br>to that through the draft emissions<br>reduction plan and that includes of<br>course finalizing emissions budgets for<br>the next 15 years which of course are<br>critical because they set the trajectory<br>and determine whether or not we'll meet<br>our climate goals or not and for that<br>reason of course they need to endure<br>across governments and so need to have<br>bipartisan support so that they're based<br>on independent advice and science and<br>don't go backwards and forwards um<br>the work that's emerging from the<br>hawaiian economic work that's uh to<br>reduce agricultural emissions another<br>big piece of work that's coming down the<br>pipes there's the introduction of<br>mandatory climate-related financial<br>discourages led by the erb<br>and of course there's the development of<br>the national education plan um which is<br>i think coming out in a couple of months<br>time<br>now in other like-minded countries like<br>the uk and<br>many other countries in the eu that work<br>unfolded over a quite a long time frame<br>but here in new zealand it's happening<br>in a very short time largely because<br>we're playing catch-up and across a wide<br>range of areas against the backdrop of<br>the global pandemic and the associated<br>economic challenges that were outlined<br>earlier<br>which is why my third point is why<br>partnering with business and the<br>development and implementation of all<br>that policy is critical if we want to<br>avoid the kinds of economic and social<br>shocks that we saw in the 1980s and<br>1990s when we didn't anticipate what the<br>uh intended attitude consequences might<br>be of those reforms so our view is that<br>it's really important that this work is<br>sequenced and that we work at a pace<br>that new zealanders can adapt to<br>otherwise we risk harming new zealanders<br>in the process or triggering a backlash<br>because we've not brought the public<br>along with us so we think that<br>government has a critical role in<br>setting a regulatory environment that<br>encourages businesses to make those<br>investments necessary for low-carbon<br>transition they also have a role for<br>making some investments themselves<br>particularly when it comes to the just<br>transition r d and other infrastructure<br>but what we've seen in other countries<br>like the uk is where the enabling role<br>of government is there you see a massive<br>investment by businesses and<br>decarbonisation and in fact well over 70<br>percent of the uh of the reduction in<br>emissions in the uk has actually come<br>out of the private sector<br>we see a just transition starting with a<br>conversation about where the impacts are<br>most likely to be felt and ensuring that<br>government is working in partnership<br>with businesses and communities to<br>mitigate those impacts so that we don't<br>see what we saw happen back in the 80s<br>and 90s so this is a climate emergency<br>and so urgent action is needed but we<br>need to ensure that the unintended<br>consequences of those actions aren't<br>harmful we think the way to do that is<br>to learn from those who are ahead of us<br>like the uk and others and to work<br>across government business and<br>communities<br>my fourth point is that when it comes to<br>climate action we need to learn how to<br>walk and chew gum at the same time<br>we already live in a world that's a 1.1<br>degree is one 1.1 degrees warmer than it<br>was at the start of the industrial<br>revolution so climate change is already<br>here and even if we take the action<br>necessary to limit warming it's likely<br>that by the end of the century we'll be<br>living in a 1.5 degree world for a<br>period of time until the impacts of our<br>actions are felt in global calling this<br>means that we need to work on both<br>climate mitigation it's reducing<br>emissions and climate adaptation at the<br>same time<br>and many businesses are just getting<br>their head around reducing their<br>emissions and now they've got to get<br>their head around how they adapt this<br>climate that's going to continue to<br>change for at least the next 50 years or<br>more so we've kicked off some work in<br>this area in the anticipation of the<br>draft national adaptation plan and we<br>anticipate that the impacts on climate<br>adaptation will be every bit as<br>significant for new zealand businesses<br>as climate mitigation has been<br>and so being able to take action on both<br>mitigation and education is going to be<br>really important<br>for business<br>but that's all i'm going to kick off<br>with today um steven and looking forward<br>to the questions and answers that come<br>up<br>thanks very much mike uh comprehensive<br>view on uh<br>on uh the impact particularly of climate<br>change in a very short space of time so<br>well done<br>now brian chapel from the treasury our<br>second treasury speaker of the day we<br>had the secretary carolee and earlier<br>brian um i suppose<br>uh i'm interested from a treasury<br>perspective<br>you've just heard sort of two passionate<br>discussions about firstly the labour<br>market and then<br>uh climate change from two different<br>perspectives what's treasury<br>keeping an eye on um in all this<br>environment<br>well thanks steven and kyoto koto and<br>i'll try not to contradict my boss as<br>you've uh helpfully pointed out she<br>spoke earlier<br>look i'm not going to presume to<br>tell businesses how to navigate the<br>environment but i do think there's a few<br>kind of themes that are going on here<br>and it's kind of useful to think about<br>the types of regulation that are<br>happening differently but first i do<br>just want to pick up on something you<br>said at the beginning stephen about<br>covert and just acknowledge that<br>it's having very different impacts on<br>different<br>types of businesses and i i don't think<br>i've seen as a sort of such extreme<br>heterogeneity in different parts of the<br>economy in my career so<br>i think we do have to be really<br>cognizant of that when we're thinking<br>about regulation in the way in which<br>it's going to land right it's not we<br>can't go back to some of these kind of<br>one-size-fits-all type approaches and<br>kind of think that because on average<br>the cost benefit says it's positive it's<br>kind of positive because the impacts are<br>going to be<br>really quite different<br>just thinking about the two areas that<br>uh craig and mike have talked about i<br>think they're quite different in nature<br>so the labor market ones and i'd include<br>immigration in there um they're sort of<br>one-off i think of them as one-off<br>there's a whole lot of them but they're<br>kind of a big set of changes um maybe a<br>shift in the pendulum if you like and<br>you know then business can kind of<br>you know whether they like it or not uh<br>can kind of get on and operate in that<br>new environment and it's kind of<br>certainty um about what that is right as<br>i say whether or not you agree with them<br>this kind of certainty i think the key<br>just the scale of those changes at once<br>and how do we make sure that they don't<br>undermine you know the ends that they're<br>trying to achieve which i think as you<br>said as well you know we all kind of<br>agree with the ends um the aims but you<br>know um<br>you know with a lot of things happening<br>all at once it's quite difficult to work<br>out what that end impact is going to be<br>and how all this is going to play out so<br>that's the way we're approaching<br>those issues i think the resources and<br>climate<br>ones are different and that they are the<br>start of a longer term trend i think<br>we're going to see ongoing change in<br>those areas as we get to grip with the<br>kind of transition that we're we're<br>going to see<br>and i think in part that um you know<br>that's kind of about ensuring our<br>economic model is sustainable for the<br>long term um and and i think of it as<br>pricing externalities and just getting<br>those underlying incentives right for<br>the economy that's the sort of basic<br>the other kind of point i'd make about<br>that is for both climate and adaptation<br>uh sorry climate mitigation and<br>adaptation you've got to think about<br>both the transition costs and what the<br>end point is going to be like so the<br>climate commission modeling suggested<br>that the end point for the economy won't<br>be all that different from what it would<br>have been without this transition yep<br>there's a bit of a negative impact but<br>it's not um it's well within the margins<br>of error of any kind of economic<br>forecast going up to 2050. let's put it<br>that way<br>but what we haven't really focused on or<br>talked about is how we're going to share<br>the burden of the transition cost across<br>the private sector both business and<br>individuals and also across the<br>government clearly government's going to<br>fund some of it and some of it is going<br>to be<br>both incentivizing the change and<br>compensating some of the people who are<br>losers on the way through or who are<br>adversely impacted on the way through<br>but i think most of the burden is going<br>to fall on the private sector via a mix<br>of both kind of relative price changes<br>and regulation<br>but importantly even where the<br>government does<br>fund some of these things it's really<br>important that<br>we are altering relative prices so that<br>those um to support that underlying<br>investment otherwise you really like ken<br>kanute<br>kind of standing there trying to fund<br>something and the underlying forces in<br>the economy are pushing you in a<br>different direction and um<br>kind of that way lies madness so i think<br>it is really important<br>my biggest um<br>kind of i guess piece of context or way<br>of thinking about this massive climate<br>and resourcing change we're undergoing<br>is to think really hard about the<br>underlying relative prices and sort of<br>incentives and economic signals that we<br>need to be sending for the long term and<br>get those clear so that then people can<br>start operating in a coherent way and<br>although i said we're not really going<br>to get certainty about how all this<br>locks at least you can start<br>getting some sense of direction from<br>that<br>uh the final sort of um<br>kind of observation i'd make about the<br>regulatory changes is um you know as<br>craig pointed out governments are<br>elected and and have a mandate to make<br>changes and in particular areas they<br>they want to do and um my job is to give<br>them some um really good advice and then<br>enthusiastically uh let the you know<br>help them do whatever it is they decide<br>to do and and that's the nature of the<br>role<br>but i think you know<br>for people like me it's really important<br>we have a really good understanding of<br>the impacts on business and more so than<br>usual the impacts on different types of<br>business and how that's going to vary<br>across<br>getting the covered context and then<br>communicate that clearly to ministers so<br>they make their decisions i think the<br>other kind of observation i'd make is<br>that within the um<br>you know within that regulatory change<br>there's often a lot of tiny little<br>details that the decisions that get<br>taken that make quite a difference to<br>the actual costs on the ground for<br>businesses and often we can make quite a<br>difference to those without you know<br>even while doing the going in the<br>direction the government's chosen to do<br>and achieving its broader objectives you<br>can make things much more simpler and<br>straightforward for business to do that<br>if we can work together on some of those<br>implementation details better and<br>there's any number of examples where we<br>don't get that done well uh and<br>somewhere we do so i think that is uh<br>you know just echoing likes plea for<br>business stakeholders and government to<br>work together to make it work<br>uh and just finally a point on the<br>broader uh business environment clearly<br>um free flow of people is going to be<br>very important too and no doubt that's<br>something that will be touched on<br>throughout the rest of the two days but<br>i'll stop there stephen and let you lead<br>us through a discussion<br>thanks very much brian that was great<br>the and and to all our speakers just<br>before i go back to the other panel<br>members uh one of the things<br>caroline was asked about this morning<br>was this whole question of who measures<br>the costs and benefits of different<br>regularly initiatives and who's there<br>looking at the cumulative effect and you<br>mentioned it in relation to the labor<br>market<br>as you and i would both know<br>relying on individual agencies<br>to come up with robust cost benefit<br>analyses and so on um is variable um if<br>we could put it that way and so there is<br>a role for treasury but i also realize<br>that treasury<br>is has got to be a mile wide and an inch<br>deep really because you're covering the<br>whole of government activity<br>have you thought and have you considered<br>for example in labor market reforms<br>immigration and so on<br>of perhaps putting together a more sort<br>of<br>uh given that that's a big error of<br>government activity a more sort of<br>robust um group of people with a<br>specific whether you call it<br>a task force or whatever with a specific<br>mindset of understanding those<br>cumulative effects better before they<br>all happen<br>no but i think that is something we um<br>we need to think about i think that i<br>mean one area where i've seen government<br>try to do it is on the agricultural<br>sector where again a lot of these<br>change environmental<br>uh kind of hitting but um we have kind<br>of thought about it in the site abstract<br>way in the labor market but not in that<br>kind of comprehensive way i mean part of<br>the challenge of doing it is that the<br>way in which even the labor market<br>regulations will affect businesses will<br>vary quite a lot between businesses so<br>um you know if you're a minimum wage<br>or sit close to that retail business for<br>example it's going to be very different<br>than if you're a you know a tech<br>business kind of thing so<br>it's hard to do<br>okay great thanks<br>let's stay with the labor market then<br>for the moment and craig um<br>obviously as a representative of workers<br>in terms of ctu and so on<br>um<br>you'll obviously be keen to ensure that<br>everybody still has lots of work<br>there's a theme running around in some<br>business circles which is<br>that yeah we could be careful we could<br>break<br>break the sector a little bit if we rush<br>too hard and i know you did address that<br>a bit<br>but um i think it is a concern<br>and and also potentially a concern about<br>the competitiveness of international<br>facing businesses<br>and i suppose the unique aspect of this<br>country is just how small and thinly<br>spread we are<br>and i think of regional businesses you<br>know where you're the local<br>pub or whatever and you really are<br>you know you're struggling to just make<br>a buck um and uh and i suppose<br>from a ctu's perspective understanding<br>the direction you want to head down and<br>what the government wants to do but do<br>you think about<br>these<br>these potential externalities and<br>potential risks to perhaps particularly<br>regional areas and so on um from such<br>things as the fair pay agreements<br>thanks david yeah certainly um you know<br>the ctu wants as many people to be<br>employed in good work as is possible um<br>so we want to live it we want a minimum<br>wage which supports the aspiration of<br>having as many people to be in good work<br>as possible and that applies equally<br>across the country um fortunately for us<br>the evidence on things like the minimum<br>wage and from overseas and from other<br>jurisdictions is that for every 10<br>increase in the minimum wage general<br>prices rise by point four percent um so<br>you know the evidence on things like the<br>minimum wage increases is is quite small<br>um in terms of price rises but certainly<br>one of the things we take into<br>consideration in terms of fair pay<br>agreements and the proposal that's on as<br>i understand it that is being discussed<br>um has the possibility um um of um you<br>know of providing for regional or local<br>variations<br>um and<br>as a you know they will be sector-led um<br>agreements which will be freely<br>bargained between um employers and<br>employees to commence with so they'll be<br>they'll be dealt with from bargaining<br>sides on both sides so you know and<br>clearly<br>the employment impacts of whatever goes<br>into a fair pay agreement and we're<br>clearly one of the things that we'll be<br>talking to the bargaining sites for<br>trade unions on but i'm sure it's one of<br>the considerations that unions will be<br>considering in setting and helping to<br>set a fair pay agreement for an<br>occupation or a sector<br>okay thanks<br>um mike what's your<br>uh feedback from from members i mean<br>obviously your direct interest to<br>sustainable business council but you<br>also have a involvement in the wider<br>business new zealand setup<br>what's your feedback<br>from members at the moment in terms of<br>pace of regulation i appreciate it might<br>be different from the beginning of town<br>to the little guys<br>you know your chambers of commerce and<br>emas and so on not so little with the<br>ema but anyway um<br>all that<br>uh what's your what's your read of the<br>temperature check of businesses at the<br>moment<br>yeah maybe i'll start with the area that<br>i just talked about um<br>i think the sense on um<br>on the sustainability side of regulation<br>is that there there was a lot of<br>catching up to do and that some of that<br>stuff had been on agendas for quite some<br>time the rma reform was one of them that<br>was on the to-do list i think of a range<br>of<br>governments over the years and so um you<br>know that's accepted that that's going<br>to be some pain for hopefully a good<br>outcome<br>um and same with the the work on<br>missions you know that there was a bit<br>of catching up to do we'd fallen well<br>behind our peer group particularly the<br>uk and others and there was some<br>catching up to do there i think the<br>concern is just with the breadth of it<br>there's just happening all at the same<br>time and<br>at a really challenging time you know<br>this is a time where companies are you<br>know fearful for their own survival in<br>many cases and so one of the things that<br>we've talked to the government about is<br>is the be kind strategist<br>which is uh<br>we're really keen for this to happen um<br>we've done<br>not a lot for the previous 30 years<br>we're now trying to cram 30 years worth<br>of work into two<br>we would rather see that happen in a<br>slightly slower pace and we're not<br>saying don't you know don't do it and<br>we're not saying don't lose the momentum<br>we're just saying make sure that you do<br>it at a pace that people can keep up<br>with that the companies can keep up with<br>particularly this morning to town<br>because um you know the larger companies<br>you know<br>have a bit more go on uh come and go on<br>this<br>i think the the point the question that<br>you asked brian earlier is a really<br>important one which is what is the<br>cumulative effect of what we're doing<br>here and i think the answer is i'm not<br>sure any of us really know<br>because we're doing a lot of you know<br>quite significant reform all at the same<br>time<br>with the backdrop of you know the<br>largest<br>um you know crisis that the planet's<br>seen probably since the oil crisis in<br>the uh 70s possibly you'd have to go<br>back to world war ii to see something<br>that's significant so the truth is we<br>don't know and i i would like to see<br>some work done on what the uh cumulative<br>impact of this will be because i think<br>then that then we can make some choices<br>about sequencing you know what do we do<br>and what at what time<br>i worry that what we'll do is we will do<br>a classic new zealand thing of trying to<br>rush it all through and then we will<br>spend years trying to unpick some of<br>that and do it better and what i would<br>rather do is we do it you know my<br>father's uh added you know measure twice<br>cut once um and i'm not talking about<br>years here i'm just talking about you<br>know the next<br>you know year two years i'd like to see<br>some sequence in there<br>the other thing that we are seeing is<br>that the issue of um<br>uh i mean when we ask our members what<br>the biggest issue on their mind at the<br>moment is in fact we go out to new<br>zealand just generally and ask them<br>about that<br>in the top 10<br>five of them are about um<br>standard of living<br>they're about affordability they're it's<br>interesting they're really crowding out<br>in fact of the top five<br>four of them are economic and that's a<br>huge difference from two years ago and<br>so what we're having to do as an<br>organization is kind of tilt into that<br>area around if you like the social part<br>of esg you know normally we we're more<br>focused on the environmental now we're<br>realizing that actually the impact on<br>people's lives of of just the last two<br>years really has been really significant<br>so<br>what we're hearing from our members and<br>i see it as being part of the broader<br>business new zealand network is just<br>that this the social and economic cost<br>of this um of this um<br>this crisis hasn't really come to bear<br>yet let's be honest we've been dancing<br>we've been shadow boxing code that<br>happened now it hasn't actually been<br>here now we're about to experience the<br>real thing and so we're watching that<br>carefully and making sure that we go at<br>a pace that our businesses can adapt to<br>thanks very much uh mike the<br>well a couple of our questioners have<br>come up with questions which i might<br>introduce at the moment which i think<br>reflect a theme that a couple of you<br>raised already which is the quality of<br>implementation of policy<br>one particular question about the<br>current credit legislation<br>which uh suggests that you know an<br>implementation it hasn't been that um<br>stellar i think is probably the term<br>and i think there's certainly some some<br>appearances that that's indeed the case<br>and you'd have to say looking at that<br>one there were plenty of people saying<br>ahead of time who you pull up<br>there's going to be a problem here if<br>you proceed on this basis<br>and so there was no shortage of people<br>prepared to to offer a view but for<br>whatever reason it didn't quite make it<br>through to the minister's table<br>and<br>and therefore and probably using that as<br>an example of the wider question of<br>implementation how good are we at it<br>really<br>uh and<br>what could we do better<br>you know beyond just talking to each<br>other because sometimes people talk and<br>you know i've been at select committee<br>submissions arrive they're very good<br>submissions well argued<br>and they sort of go into a big box<br>and the minister charges on regardless<br>um and that's on both sides of politics<br>he said quickly and so how do we how do<br>we do that bit better uh because with a<br>lot with a lot going on uh things are<br>things you know the risk has got to be<br>pretty high let's start with brian as<br>the man in the hot seat<br>and then we'll go to craig<br>yeah so um i'm not going to talk about<br>the triple cfa in any detail and just<br>let that play out for the time being but<br>i agree with the general point if i<br>think about recent regulatory failures<br>um we've had around health and safety uh<br>you know the the leaky building the um<br>finance company one<br>that i was involved in some of the<br>aftermath of in the past and the gfc you<br>know a lot of those are actually not not<br>so much about the frameworks we've had<br>but about the way we've ended up doing<br>kind of enforcement and kind of that<br>back end the frontline stuff i think we<br>have actually got a lot better at that<br>so there's been some um you know stuff<br>that actually was probably started when<br>you were involved in this um stephen uh<br>like g-reg you know professionalising<br>some of the frontline regulators giving<br>qualifications and things like that so i<br>think there are things that are<br>happening there but uh it has been a bit<br>of a a weak spot where we've tended to<br>concentrate you know people like me do<br>the framework stuff um and then<br>you know both ministers and um and the<br>policymakers move on to the next thing<br>and we don't think about how it's<br>actually going to happen and play it on<br>the ground enough<br>craig what about you um<br>you must be concerned about you know<br>access to credit and things for<br>businesses as part of your remit that's<br>particular example but also more broadly<br>uh on the in the area of of of<br>implementation<br>i'm sure i mean um<br>i'm i'm first of all shocked um uh<br>steven that you suggest that politicians<br>don't listen um to people um you know of<br>that statement um however um what i<br>would say is that you know intern again<br>like brian there's there's a process<br>underway with the review of the triple<br>cfa um and you know and i won't talk to<br>that now but what i would say is that<br>the triple c fa reforms will probably in<br>themselves an attempt to regulate a<br>regulatory failure<br>um because we had a lot of situations in<br>which we had predatory lending we had<br>poor forms of lending going on to<br>households um who couldn't afford to<br>actually pay the lending in the first<br>place and you know we're doing a lot of<br>work with fincap and with households who<br>you know have clearly um had mis-selling<br>of financial services delivered<br>delivered to them and to our members and<br>that's really you know so so what we<br>shouldn't do is seek to throw the baby<br>out with the bath water by saying our<br>regulation didn't work therefore we<br>should stop that regulation and deliver<br>a completely different regulation what<br>we should recognize is that many of the<br>problems that we have are actually the<br>consequences of previous regulatory<br>failings arguably you know one of the<br>biggest regulatory failings we have<br>right now is the housing crisis in new<br>zealand and 30 to 40 years of failure to<br>regulate land supply failure to regulate<br>and building demand failure to regulate<br>the the number of construction firms<br>that we have in the sector properly and<br>so to deliver the kinds of outcomes that<br>we actually want to see that's why i<br>said at the beginning of the in in my in<br>my speech the it's not it's not about<br>the number of regulations it's about<br>making sure that the regulations that<br>you have are delivering on your goal and<br>and for me certainly you know the the<br>you know the ability to implement the<br>regulations and that we've got in new<br>zealand we should learn from what we've<br>done in the past and i think that's<br>where sometimes we fail a little bit in<br>new zealand as we we seek to regulate<br>without seeking to learn properly why<br>we're needing to regulate it what's<br>failed in the past in the first place<br>yep<br>sort of increased thoughtfulness i<br>wonder sometimes too um this will be<br>heresy to my former colleagues um the<br>idea of of having a select committee is<br>a little bit more independent of the<br>executive<br>i think would be a very worthwhile um<br>exercise unfortunately in our country<br>well fortunately in some ways but<br>unfortunately others because everybody's<br>aspiring to get into the executive<br>you don't have what we have in the uk<br>which is often a much more independent<br>uh back bench and much more focused on<br>scrutiny of pieces of legislation<br>michael are you any views in this<br>particular area i i do steve i haven't<br>both sides of the fence so of course<br>i've got some peace offers<br>i suppose my first thing would be to say<br>that<br>what i observe is that when the private<br>sector wants to go about doing something<br>it really throws a lot of resource into<br>it<br>and what i've observed having worked in<br>government and worked as a consultant to<br>government and now working alongside him<br>as a partner is a chronic under<br>resourcing on big projects<br>uh but big policy projects i mean you<br>know the sense is uh once the policy is<br>signed off it's done<br>um whereas in fact the hard work begins<br>at that stage so i would say that we<br>um<br>we're not great at execution as a<br>country i think we uh we kind of we wing<br>it and as a result um i think a lot of<br>our work is it's not as good as it<br>should be<br>the exception to that was um some of the<br>work that we did i think in the late 80s<br>and early 90s when we did throw the<br>kitchen sink out in terms of resources<br>and we attracted a lot of talenting to<br>do that work i would say that we haven't<br>done that in quite some time so that's<br>my comment on that one my other comment<br>would just be to say that we don't learn<br>from overseas again and again our<br>parochialism is legendary globally um<br>i've worked in uh foreign affairs for<br>ireland you know we are known as being<br>hyper parochial people won't say it to<br>our faces but if they think you're an<br>australian they'll tell you um and um<br>you know we really are an island a<br>little group of islanders and we don't<br>like to learn from others even if it's<br>even if there's a model we can grab and<br>my class i could give you having some<br>more examples of this but um i've seen<br>it happen half a dozen times where there<br>was something a piece of technology we<br>could have grabbed from somewhere<br>for very little money or an idea that we<br>could have ripped off and implemented in<br>new zealand but no<br>we have to come up with something from<br>the ground up that makes no sense i say<br>to people it's kind of like developing<br>your own word processor fun but stupid<br>and we do that i think we do that far<br>too often and then my final point on<br>this i suppose would just be around um<br>the<br>the rate of change you know we we we<br>love to fiddle we love to meddle and to<br>your point um you know uh you know there<br>was a little book written back in the uh<br>late 70s wasn't it uh uh by jeffrey<br>palmer um that originally had a<br>christian mark and then he got rid of<br>the christian unbridled coward<br>um you know the reforms that were done<br>uh around our um around our voting<br>system were actually a proxy for dealing<br>with uh executive overreach in the 70s<br>but we didn't actually address that so<br>what we have is a situation now we're<br>effectively we have a as jeffrey palmer<br>used to refer to his elected<br>dictatorships you know they can't<br>governments come in there's no<br>regulatory chief there really and i<br>think that leads to some optimal<br>outcomes on the quality of our of our<br>work so to your point i do think that if<br>there was a greater independence uh with<br>that scrutiny we'd end up with a better<br>product because in the end that's the<br>benefit of a liberal democracy isn't it<br>is it that's actual scrutiny of<br>legislation as the critical piece so<br>there you go there's my views thank you<br>very much look i just want to change<br>tech before we finish because there's a<br>big elephant in the room which is<br>probably troubling for everybody here<br>and that is inflation uh now um and<br>what seems to be as an outsider looking<br>and i'm not being critical of the new<br>zealand reserve bank at this point uh<br>because i think it's a worldwide<br>phenomenon where central banks feel like<br>they've been dovish for too long<br>uh and now we're now we're fighting<br>inflation from behind the eight ball<br>uh um<br>how worried are the three of you about<br>that from a business perspective<br>and<br>and i'd be worried about a wage price<br>spiral and that's not to pick on um<br>people going for wage increases because<br>i certainly would but uh but more a case<br>of that that's the logical outcome of<br>this at least in the short term<br>particularly with a you know closed off<br>labour market from the rest of the world<br>uh yeah we've got some we've got some<br>real challenges ahead of us so<br>interested in your views let's start<br>perhaps with craig and uh and then mike<br>thanks steven i i mean in terms of um to<br>answer your second question first um if<br>there's going to be you know is there<br>evidence of a wage price spiral we've<br>got evidence of the um the price spiral<br>we have five point nine percent<br>inflation we don't necessarily have<br>evidence of the wage spiral to accompany<br>it um you know lci and so labor cost<br>inflation um for memory is is 2.8<br>um in the latest data set um and you<br>know even if you take um our ordinary<br>hourly meaning wages it's nowhere near<br>um the current level of inflation um and<br>similarly when none of the forecasts see<br>that the the level of wages reaching the<br>level of inflation and in any short run<br>um scenario i also think we also have a<br>very<br>bifurcated labor market um the recovery<br>that we've seen to date and cover is if<br>you have skills if you're in demand<br>you're doing well and you may well be<br>benefiting and from the recovery and<br>from the growth that we genuinely have<br>seen postcoded um if you're not doing so<br>well if perhaps you don't have the<br>skills that are needed in the economy or<br>you were in a sector that was suffering<br>to date then you're probably continuing<br>to see your relative quality of life in<br>comparison to others decline and that<br>k-shaped recovery that some economists<br>talk about i can see that certainly<br>continuing over the time period that's<br>why you know lifts to the minimum wage<br>are quite important in order to create a<br>flaw for that to make sure that doesn't<br>get us you know worse than<br>it positively could be so i don't see<br>the wage price spiral yet i certainly<br>see the prices rising but i don't<br>necessarily see the wages rising on the<br>other side do i think it's a real<br>problem for businesses going forward<br>well<br>to be honest there's a bunch of<br>economists who tell me that it's<br>permanent but it's here and that<br>inflation's out of control and you know<br>we need to lift the ocr regularly and<br>because it's a permanent issue now in<br>the economy and there's a bunch of<br>economists who tell me that frankly this<br>is a transient issue this is about oil<br>this is about shipping costs this is<br>about a bunch of things and they'll go<br>away once the bottlenecks ease<br>one of them will be right um you know<br>for my money i'm still in still more in<br>team transient than i am in team<br>permanent um but it will create real<br>issues and for businesses even in the<br>short run um you know in terms of<br>managing costs um but right now that<br>doesn't seem to be having a depressing<br>effect on economic activity um and so<br>you know it may be that one of the<br>things you want to look at is<br>is does does the reserve bank with its<br>current ocr track see that having a<br>depressing effect on economic activity<br>and from memory the last mps continues<br>to see economic growth going forward so<br>i don't think it's it's don't think it's<br>a fantastic i don't think it's the most<br>important issue yet i think skills um<br>access to workers is probably the most<br>important issue and that's what the<br>surveys tell us for um uh for businesses<br>right now but if inflation became<br>permanent then clearly it would be a<br>very important issue for businesses<br>thank you craig<br>mike<br>just a quick comment from you it'll come<br>as no surprise i'm very worried about it<br>um you know and<br>all you need to do is you know i'm you<br>know i've got a background in<br>development economics and so all you<br>need to do is look at developing<br>countries and see that uh<br>you know why are they still developing<br>because they've let inflation run away<br>time and time and time again i agree<br>with craig it's one of a set of things<br>that we need to be concerned about it's<br>not just one of them but it is something<br>we need to be concerned about i'm<br>confident that we've got the tools to<br>manage it um i mean i'd be interested in<br>you know how long is transient<br>i think it could be a year or two you<br>know uh but i am confident that we could<br>we can get on top of it using the tools<br>that we have<br>but um i think you you you know you'd be<br>full not to be focused on it because we<br>haven't been in a situation with such<br>high uh inflation for a very long time<br>but i i'm confident we can get on top of<br>it it is an indicator though of just how<br>different these times are from the last<br>30 years you know we are in something<br>that looks feels a bit more like the 70s<br>to me than it than it does the 80s and<br>90s and that means that we're going to<br>have to use some you know some<br>reasonably big tools in our toolbox to<br>manage that get things back on track and<br>then go from there<br>and before i go to brian i can report<br>from a number of companies that i work<br>with they're dusting off all their price<br>escalation clauses and everything else<br>um so it doesn't feel transitory to me<br>at this point everybody's trying to<br>relearn things that they haven't had to<br>know since the 70s to<br>to ensure they don't get underwater with<br>what they sell<br>brian how big a problem<br>yep i think it's definitely an issue<br>you know partly because we haven't seen<br>it for a while<br>although i share mike's view that we<br>have got the tools but it could be a<br>bumpy road and then three other<br>observations i think while i don't<br>regret any of the decisions we took over<br>the last couple of years i think this<br>turned out to be more of a supply side<br>event than a demand side event and our<br>initial response was you know what we do<br>in the demand side i think so that's a<br>you know me a culprit bit of a lesson<br>there for us two on wages interestingly<br>if you disaggregate the lci by skill<br>level it's the lowest<br>and the second lowest skill levels that<br>are seeing most of the big increases<br>coming through in wages so that's kind<br>of just interesting seeing where that<br>pressure is coming through and third how<br>this ultimately plays out is going to be<br>dependent on the housing market just<br>given that such a big part of our macro<br>transmission transmission mechanism here<br>in new zealand so i'll leave it there<br>and a big thanks to you stephen and to<br>my fellow panelists<br>thank you brian and i just we're this<br>last minute disagreement between brian<br>and craig that we have no time to<br>actually go back and delve into which is<br>never mind we can do that later at some<br>point in the future look thanks very<br>much to the three of you uh for being<br>with us today and for your insights i<br>highly appreciate it as i said at one<br>point i'm sure everybody agrees on the<br>outcome there's just difference of<br>opinions on how we might get there which<br>is the nature of political economy<br>thank you very much for your time and i<br>look forward to seeing you again at some<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
