i've been<br>particularly looking forward to this<br>this session too uh neil started right<br>out in his intro comments talking about<br>the importance of inequality helen clark<br>mentioned that covert has globally<br>increased inequality and new zealand is<br>no exception that certainly came through<br>in the last session on education um so<br>you know i'm really looking forward to<br>to the insights that our panelists today<br>will bring<br>our two distinguished panelists that we<br>have with us today we have professor<br>jonathan boston from<br>the school of government at victoria<br>university of wellington<br>and we have matt burgess from the new<br>zealand initiative<br>very very much looking forward to the<br>insights that each of the panelists are<br>going to bring but i'm also looking<br>forward to the probing questions that<br>the audience will bring that will really<br>draw on the expertise of our panelists<br>so keep those slider questions rolling<br>in and with that i'd like to pass<br>straight over to you jonathan thanks<br>well thank you anna uh<br>katoa everyone thank you for this<br>opportunity to contribute<br>to this forum<br>currently new zealand has significant<br>disparities in income and wealth<br>these include both intra and<br>intergenerational disparities along with<br>ethnic<br>gender and geographic disparities<br>our attitude to these disparities is<br>inevitably<br>shaped<br>by our philosophical ideological and<br>religious convictions<br>there is no moral<br>neutrality in this space<br>the territory is inherently value-laden<br>and deeply contested<br>people disagree about both the ends and<br>the means and of course there's much<br>complexity<br>for multiple ethical reasons i believe<br>that a just or fair society requires a<br>broadly egalitarian approach<br>and this entails at least four things<br>first a strong commitment to the equal<br>value worth and dignity of every person<br>supported by a comprehensive set of<br>equal citizenship rights<br>second a requirement to satisfy every<br>person's basic needs which in turn means<br>minimizing income-based poverty and<br>material hardship<br>so a commitment to intergenerational<br>justice which includes protecting<br>ecological integrity and sustainability<br>and fourth support for the principle of<br>fair equality of opportunity<br>applied broadly but also to specific<br>goods and services like education which<br>was the subject of a previous discussion<br>our current relatively high rates of<br>income and wealth inequality<br>with gini coefficients in this country<br>for both<br>well above 30 percent<br>are not consistent in my view with these<br>principles of justice<br>moreover there is reliable international<br>evidence that higher rates of income and<br>wealth inequality<br>tend other things being equal<br>to reduce social cohesion and trust<br>increase corruption<br>weaken democratic institutions and<br>exacerbate ecological degradation<br>there was a good case in my view for<br>reducing income and wealth inequality in<br>new zealand well before the covert 19<br>pandemic<br>but the pandemic has almost certainly<br>increased wealth inequality<br>and worsened intergenerational<br>inequality<br>given the massive increase in house<br>prices<br>the current ecological crises climate<br>biodiversity loss and so on will<br>ultimately<br>impose vast additional costs on future<br>generations<br>unjustly<br>the pandemic has not however worsened<br>poverty<br>stats new zealand released their latest<br>poverty data this morning for the year<br>ended june 2021<br>and in brief across the three key<br>primary poverty measures<br>uh child poverty rates which essentially<br>measure family poverty<br>these rates remained broadly stable<br>over recent years or declined slightly<br>as a result two of the three<br>intermediate targets<br>that the government set for child<br>poverty reduction have been met<br>nevertheless significant rates of<br>poverty remain<br>and there has been little change to the<br>rates of severe material hardship over<br>recent years which is particularly<br>concerning i had expected material<br>hardship rates to increase in the year<br>to june 2021 because of the pandemic but<br>it did not perhaps for two reasons<br>first<br>the government's multiple covert<br>response measures appear to have been<br>relatively successful for example median<br>household disposable incomes were up<br>around 4.5 percent in the year to june<br>2021<br>second stats new zealand doesn't<br>interview destitute people<br>or those in emergency housing<br>and it is quite likely that the covet<br>pandemic increased the number of such<br>people<br>for those who accept the case for lower<br>rates of income<br>and wealth inequality including less<br>poverty<br>the fundamental question is how to do so<br>in the most cost effective and<br>sustainable manner<br>and there's no simple answer<br>unfortunately there is a powerful<br>political asymmetry at work<br>it is much easier politically to<br>increase inequality than to reduce it<br>also in a globalized world there are<br>constraints on what individual nations<br>can do<br>broadly speaking the key to reducing<br>economic inequality is enhancing the<br>redistributive impact<br>of the tax and welfare system or the<br>transfer system<br>on the tax side there are obviously<br>various options<br>but they're all problematic for one<br>reason or another<br>the options include capital gains taxes<br>land taxes wealth taxes<br>inheritance or wealth transfer taxes<br>like the lifetime gifts tax in ireland<br>and more progressive income taxes<br>and i note that at least some oecd<br>economies economists favor a combination<br>of a capital gains tax and an<br>inheritance tax<br>on the income transfer side the current<br>options in new zealand include more<br>generous welfare benefits more generous<br>tax credits such as the family tax<br>credit uh linking core benefit rates to<br>prices as well as wages as they are now<br>uh<br>and increasing the age of eligibility<br>for new zealand super say to 70 years<br>in relation to housing which uh matt<br>will probably speak more about<br>housing is critical to wealth inequality<br>and it's interesting that new zealand<br>successfully increased<br>home ownership rates<br>very substantially during the immediate<br>post-war period and significantly<br>increase the social housing stock as a<br>proportion of the total housing stock<br>and ideally we need to do both these<br>things again because we've been<br>backwards for the last 40 years<br>i realize that will be difficult not<br>least fiscally<br>so to conclude uh as an egalitarian i<br>lament the current levels of income in<br>wealth inequality<br>locally and globally<br>i think they're thoroughly bad i accept<br>however that there's no optimal level of<br>economic inequality but i would prefer<br>less for the reasons i've indicated<br>there is however no easy way to achieve<br>this goal but in my view we should at<br>least try<br>well thank you very much jonathan for<br>those rich insights and your perspective<br>and including some very very fresh data<br>so that was great to keep us up to date<br>with the<br>latest data that's been released there<br>so thank you very much jonathan matt<br>let's um turn to uh<br>to your uh insights please thanks<br>good afternoon everybody thank you for<br>uh the invitation to speak um<br>uh helen clark was right wealth and<br>equality has increased in this country<br>over the last two years we've our genie<br>wealth index has increased from 67 two<br>years ago to 69 or 70 depending on which<br>source you look at<br>our wealth inequality is about double<br>and on the genie measure of income<br>inequality substantially higher but<br>that's in line with most if not all<br>other countries around the world wealth<br>is just less equal when you look<br>around the world compared to income<br>the good news is that new zealand is at<br>the bottom end of the wealth<br>inequality<br>when you look across countries we're in<br>the<br>i guess you'd say the best or the least<br>unequal unequal<br>20 of countries around the world<br>and we're actually moving<br>down that scale towards more inequality<br>in relative terms compared to other<br>countries<br>so that's the good news of the story now<br>of course the reason we're talking about<br>wealth distribution is because over the<br>last two years in particular asset<br>prices have uh essentially gone vertical<br>and in new zealand of course it's<br>housing uh of all assets that matters<br>the most housing's about half uh our net<br>wealth uh of the average household in<br>this country it's a big deal and of<br>course prices have gone uh<br>not quite vertical but not too far from<br>it<br>the average house in new zealand is now<br>one million dollars uh the average house<br>price in auckland city 1.7 million<br>dollars these numbers are uh shocking<br>in my view uh new zealand has the worst<br>performing housing market in the oecd uh<br>over the last 30 years in terms of real<br>increase in prices so we've got a<br>serious problem<br>but<br>in terms of wealth distribution housing<br>has actually been had a negative<br>impact on inequality<br>a really interesting study from treasury<br>recently showed that the increase in<br>house prices has improved or reduced<br>inequality within the group of<br>homeowners which is a large group 64 of<br>houses<br>are owner-occupied in this country<br>it's increased inequality between<br>non-homeowners and homeowners but that's<br>a small enough group that the within<br>homeowner<br>group effect dominates so surprisingly<br>housing has actually had a negative<br>impact on<br>wealth and equality even though wealth<br>inequality overall has increased in the<br>so yeah treasury uh 10<br>increase in house prices reduces uh<br>wealth inequality by 0.7 which is quite<br>a substantial uh effect so look why does<br>wealth inequality matter and i think<br>there's two uh at least two reasons why<br>we need to think about it or it's worth<br>considering the first is what's the<br>relationship between wealth distribution<br>and social outcomes that we care about<br>does chain do changes in wealth<br>distribution tell us something about<br>outcomes for people on the ground<br>and the second i think with this<br>particularly with respect to housing is<br>is the increase in housing uh telling us<br>something leading to exclusion uh which<br>for such an important asset class so<br>looking at the literature on wealth<br>inequality it's not a huge literature<br>because i think about wealth is hard to<br>uh hard to measure particularly in this<br>country we don't uh tax it<br>the relationship between wealth<br>distribution and social outcomes like<br>life expectancy education outcomes<br>infant mortality is surprisingly<br>ambiguous<br>essentially there is no consistent<br>relationship with wealth distribution<br>and those outcomes in the way there is<br>with that other measure of inequality<br>income inequality<br>so in terms of a metric that you can<br>look at and infer bad things are<br>happening on the ground for real people<br>wealth distribution or changes in wealth<br>distribution<br>isn't a particularly good measure income<br>inequality is much more interesting and<br>arguably important<br>compared to wealth<br>even though wealth of course has been on<br>the news over the last couple of years<br>in terms of house prices<br>homeownership rates have fallen<br>substantially i think as jonathan<br>mentioned uh 73 home ownership rate uh<br>30 years ago all the way down to 64<br>today<br>the change who's who's won and lost from<br>that fallen home ownership<br>20 and 30 year olds have lost by more<br>than other age categories but not by<br>that much<br>another interesting thing first time<br>share of first home buyers of all home<br>sales has been roughly static over the<br>last 20 years there hasn't been a<br>collapse in first-time buyers they're<br>still buying about a quarter of all uh<br>home purchases<br>so<br>on its face the picture in terms of<br>exclusion despite this massive increase<br>in house prices is that<br>not too many people are being locked out<br>of the market in the way we might have<br>expected but one final data point on<br>this uh which comes from australia i<br>couldn't find an equivalent number for<br>new zealand what percentage of first<br>home buyers are getting help from their<br>parents<br>in 2010 12 years ago in australia that<br>number was three percent today it's 60<br>percent and if there's anything like uh<br>something similar going on here in new<br>zealand that could be a serious uh<br>question for those who uh whose parents<br>don't own homes under the market uh they<br>may well be excluded and that's<br>potentially a very serious issue um so<br>look uh i'll wrap it up there but i<br>think you know<br>in terms of the outlook um<br>it's been an interesting picture<br>statistically it hasn't yet turned into<br>serious outcomes at the front line<br>on social outcomes<br>but ahead of us now we've got inflation<br>we've got interest rate rises on the<br>horizon we've got rents going up uh by<br>10<br>in the last year rents have been a<br>safety valve in the new zealand housing<br>market we've had persistent increases in<br>house prices over the last three decades<br>more than anywhere else in the oecd<br>rents have been pretty stable in this<br>country and now they're taking off<br>so it's<br>potentially we're in<br>uncharted territory and potentially<br>interesting and<br>dangerous territory i think<br>over the next two years potentially<br>back to you anna<br>thanks very much matt thanks for very<br>sharply reminding us of the importance<br>of housing to equality issues and my<br>kids will certainly be hoping that the<br>australian data applies to new zealand<br>as well<br>thanks also for you know sharply<br>reminding us of of the importance of<br>looking at income versus wealth<br>inequality because there are some<br>different there are some significant<br>differences there what i'd like to do<br>now is move on to a few questions the<br>first question is actually going to be<br>addressed to both of you<br>and that is let's say you've got a magic<br>policy wand<br>both of you<br>express some desire to reduce inequality<br>perhaps in different forms but what's<br>the number one policy intervention with<br>this magic policy wand what's the number<br>one policy intervention that you would<br>do you want me to start hannah go ahead<br>jonathan yes okay uh so i don't think<br>there's one<br>magic wand here<br>uh we need a combination of measures and<br>those measures would need to be applied<br>over a significant period of time to<br>make a substantive<br>and sustained difference so i would be<br>as i was sort of indicating in my<br>remarks trying to pull both the tax<br>levers and the income transfer levers<br>but maybe also labour market<br>leavers one could move as well but i<br>would i would focus on the tax<br>transfer system uh i'm not a tax policy<br>expert but from what i've read i think<br>there is a reasonably convincing case<br>for a capital gains tax a recently<br>comprehensive capital gains tax and i<br>certainly think there's a case for some<br>kind of inheritance tax<br>or<br>lifetime gift tax<br>on the on the transfer side uh i would<br>uh argue as i have over many years for a<br>further increase in core welfare<br>benefits and for more generous uh tax<br>credits particularly the family tax<br>credit<br>um and i would also argue for uh uh<br>increasing the age of eligibility for<br>new zealand super<br>uh we now have a situation where<br>ever increasing number of people<br>age 65 plus are<br>working and yet they're eligible for<br>universal<br>income transfer<br>and i don't think that is either fair or<br>reasonable um in the kind of<br>circumstances we're in so<br>a raft of measures um<br>many of which would be politically very<br>difficult to introduce<br>so lots of policy ones is what you would<br>like matt<br>fix the housing market uh<br>might be a broken record on this i'm<br>afraid but look housing really matters<br>when you look at the before and after<br>housing costs um data particularly ryan<br>perry at msd<br>housing's enormous i mean it really is<br>new zealand um you know we're pretty<br>good on a lot of things but we're<br>terrible at housing um and it affects<br>everybody<br>it affects those at the bottom uh the<br>most actually uh higher proportion of<br>income<br>goes on housing if you're in the bottom<br>end of income and it's a big number so<br>um and if you want to get really<br>specific about nothing to fix and<br>housing it is the housing supply<br>that's not more subsidies and it's<br>convincing councils to release more land<br>and build more water infrastructure in<br>particular and so the very specific<br>measure if i had a magic wand it would<br>be to improve council's ability to fund<br>water infrastructure get the pricing<br>right get their access to finance right<br>um get the incentives right and maybe<br>that's already happened with recent<br>policy changes and then watch a thousand<br>hours bloom and i think you'll see<br>you know the basic model in all of this<br>is that good policy policy that works<br>policy the targets um the right areas<br>um is going to fix or it's going to<br>raise all boats and you're going to see<br>um<br>inequality among lots of other things<br>moving in the right direction<br>and could i quickly respond just simply<br>to say i agree with matt that housing is<br>absolutely pivotal but it's not enough<br>so it's it's necessary but not<br>sufficient and i for one don't support<br>the idea of just simply paving ever more<br>uh green fields with concrete<br>however the water infrastructure is<br>funded i'd much prefer we increase our<br>housing density<br>and go up but i appreciate the problem<br>there is nimbyism<br>and that's a political problem<br>but<br>from an environmental point of view uh i<br>think we need to ensure we keep our<br>green belts around our cities and we<br>protect valuable agricultural land from<br>ever<br>greater sort of increasions from um<br>urban sprawl which also has big<br>implications for transport and so forth<br>anyway that's enough for me can i<br>respond to that<br>if you don't mind look i i don't<br>necessarily disagree at least the gross<br>terms with jonathan but let's just get<br>serious about the traders here you know<br>um<br>productive agricultural land<br>human consequences from having a<br>persistent severe under supply of<br>housing that means you've got<br>overcrowding and damp homes people<br>getting sick um<br>high share of their incomes going on<br>housing as opposed to everything else<br>they'd like to enjoy in life now that's<br>the trade-off and i think it's pretty<br>steep and as nice as you know potatoes<br>growing in productive land immediately<br>outside auckland might be<br>um i'm much more concerned uh about the<br>thousands tens of thousands of people<br>that are effectively locked out of the<br>housing market right now so um you know<br>the trade-off's very steep here but we<br>can go up as well<br>indeed and we should do that<br>one a policy one that i don't recall<br>either of you mention mentioning is the<br>proposed income insurance scheme what do<br>you think this would do to income<br>inequality<br>i'm going look i don't think it's going<br>to do much actually it's workers that<br>are paying into the pool it's workers<br>that are drawing out from the pool um<br>you know compared to um other things you<br>know superannuation other transfers tax<br>um housing uh look i don't think the<br>schemes uh i think it's gonna be large<br>pretty much a wash in terms of<br>distribution<br>yes i would tend to agree with that but<br>i would add two other elements<br>the first is what impact might<br>an unemployment and health insurance<br>scheme have<br>on<br>core benefit rates and the benefit<br>system generally there are concerns that<br>some people are how i know that it would<br>result in a less generous benefits<br>benefit system which would then impact<br>particularly on disadvantaged people um<br>i'm not sure that the international<br>evidence is consistent with that view in<br>fact i i think it's it's not<br>uh the second aspect which i think we<br>need to think about is what impact would<br>increasing the amount of social<br>insurance in our system moving beyond<br>acc and into unemployment and health<br>what will that do to the political<br>economy of the welfare state and the way<br>which people<br>ordinary voters think about the welfare<br>state my reading of the international<br>evidence<br>is that social insurance<br>tends to<br>enhance support<br>for uh<br>the welfare state as a as an overall<br>kind of entity and it does that because<br>when people are paying<br>into schemes and getting earnings<br>related<br>benefits if they need it because they<br>become unemployed<br>there's a sense of reciprocity uh people<br>contribute and then they get assistance<br>if they need it<br>in a way that a tax-funded flat rate<br>means-tested system of the kind that we<br>have doesn't generate that kind of<br>perspective so very simply<br>i think there's a possibility that<br>enhancing social insurance could<br>actually help strengthen the welfare<br>state and to that extent actually help<br>reduce inequality long run but i may be<br>wrong<br>jonathan there's a specific question<br>that's come through for you<br>you um you mentioned that<br>incoming inequality is is influenced in<br>part by the people who are voting is<br>there a case for reforming<br>uh<br>the way we vote to reduce the the<br>influence of older people and wealthier<br>people well having<br>said in my remarks that i believe in<br>equal citizenship rights i certainly<br>have no desire to reduce the<br>political rights of particular sections<br>of the community<br>there is a case for reducing the um<br>voting age from 18 to 16. i happen to<br>support that but i don't think it would<br>make a huge difference<br>um but it might if we did ensure that<br>younger people are more likely to vote<br>because it would mean that people would<br>start voting at school<br>and it would get them familiar with the<br>whole process of being a citizen and<br>contributing to public life um but no i<br>i wouldn't i don't think changing the<br>electoral system is going to make any<br>difference in the overall scheme of<br>things to um<br>to<br>and a question that will take you both<br>into some slightly different space why<br>does the toolbox to reduce income<br>inequality not reach beyond tax transfer<br>maybe even housing mat<br>and include investment in healthy early<br>child development and skills<br>matt would you like to start with that<br>one<br>well look i think it does i mean the<br>whole idea of the social investment<br>program under the previous government<br>was to do exactly that to find<br>opportunities to invest early and make a<br>huge difference um<br>um you know with data it's you need data<br>to find these opportunities and it's<br>really hard to do<br>especially from the center<br>um that was that was a whole idea so<br>that absolutely is part of the the<br>toolkit um<br>the problem is the technical difficulty<br>of actually achieving it um in a system<br>from the center it's it's just hard to<br>do<br>but i think it's i think it's going to<br>happen<br>and i'd completely agree with matt uh<br>we only had five minutes so<br>it's not possible to kind of cover the<br>whole raft of policies that influence um<br>uh income and wealth distribution<br>which<br>you know<br>obviously vast reigns a range of<br>policies have have some impact<br>covering health housing<br>education tertiary education and so<br>forth<br>so that would certainly be another one<br>that you might look at uh adding to the<br>toolkit there<br>let's move on to it ready we already uh<br>can spend quite a lot on<br>education um there is certainly<br>a case i think uh for giving more weight<br>to the early years relative to perhaps<br>the later years of education um<br>but we already invest quite heavily in<br>thanks let's<br>perhaps take you to a broader um<br>question there's been quite a theme of<br>the impact of covet including on<br>inequality through a number of the<br>presentations um during the day um i<br>wonder your views about whether covet<br>has permanently changed the dynamics of<br>inequality in new zealand is it has it<br>done something permanent that's changed<br>the dynamics or is it<br>you know just another transitory impact<br>that<br>that doesn't fundamentally change<br>anything about the the the inequality<br>i can have a go with that all right<br>so i<br>i've thought of maybe this is over<br>simplifying it but i've thought of<br>covert as an exogenous shock that's come<br>not as the product of economic malaise<br>or male investment within the economy<br>but it's just been come from the outside<br>it's hit us pretty hard<br>and it's caused disruption while it's<br>here<br>but i've long thought that ultimately<br>the fundamental<br>dynamics within the economy don't need<br>to change in response um and we can<br>have this sort of bullish view that we<br>can bounce back rapidly re reestablish<br>the networks that have been lost um<br>they're still there um they may not be<br>connected right now but they can be<br>reestablished quickly because the<br>fundamentals there isn't that normal<br>thing you get in the recession of having<br>to reorganize the economy<br>shut down businesses free up capital<br>shift to somewhere else and all of that<br>i think<br>so i've always felt that the recovery<br>from covert will be faster than it will<br>be from other recessions<br>the thing that gives me pause though is<br>that policy settings may not go back to<br>what they were now we've got inflation<br>and a lot of fiscal impulse um still in<br>the pipeline<br>um and uh<br>also zoom you know just the fact that<br>people might be working keep working<br>from home after all of this those are<br>potential long longer lasting structural<br>changes<br>none of it<br>seems to have any obvious direct<br>implication for inequality<br>um you've got you know the one thing you<br>would say is you you've got a bigger<br>government coming out on the other side<br>of this<br>um and that may have uh well have uh<br>consequences for inequality but in terms<br>of covert per se i i can't see anything<br>for inequality in that<br>jonathan do you share that can i say i<br>broadly agree with matt uh but i would<br>add two things first that if you think<br>about this globally many countries have<br>experienced significant increase uh<br>increase in their levels of public debt<br>and<br>that runs the risk of exacerbating<br>intergenerational inequality<br>um particularly given that many of the<br>people who've suffered quite a lot from<br>covet have been<br>young people<br>in school or in early<br>years of work<br>or in tertiary education the second<br>thing though is this and this is<br>we will take years to find out<br>but i'm sitting in an office across the<br>road from an encampment of thousands of<br>people<br>most of whom are probably low-income or<br>unemployed um or retired or simply<br>retired<br>many of them i think quite sort of<br>marginalized from the mainstream of new<br>zealand's society<br>and many of them are very aggrieved<br>by what covett has done to them<br>some of them have lost their jobs<br>because they've refused to be vaccinated<br>uh and so on um<br>my sense is that covet has among other<br>things exposed and heightened<br>some some significant<br>um<br>tensions uh and and dislocations within<br>our society<br>and and that concerns me<br>and and the effects of that could be<br>quite long lasting<br>i i hope not but<br>we'll i guess we'll find out<br>one of the other<br>sorry just to pick up on something<br>jonathan said inflation of course what<br>we are getting out of code that is<br>inflation not just us right around the<br>world<br>that is that does have consequences for<br>inequality that will uh tend to hurt<br>people at the bottom and that's what<br>inflation does<br>um<br>the good news is that uh certainly i<br>think for new zealand it will be<br>transitory in 18 months we will be back<br>within one to three percent um that's<br>and substantially because we<br>well you know i've actually looked at<br>the history of inflation and they are<br>about two years long uh on average and<br>actually new zealand's pretty well<br>placed to recover from inflation we the<br>institutions are sound we've got an<br>independent central bank nice clean<br>legislation it's a good setup and we've<br>got low public debt and that really<br>counts it makes the promise credible<br>when the reserve bank says we're getting<br>back to target now consider the<br>situation in europe christine lagarde<br>the president of the european central<br>bank uh has got one or two or three<br>members that are going to<br>exit um<br>rather disorderly in a disorderly way if<br>interest rates rise uh too much further<br>italy sitting 160 public debt greece is<br>more than 200<br>uh<br>it's a serious problem when interest<br>rates go up when it's time to fight<br>inflation so they are sitting there<br>hoping that um their inflation really is<br>transitory and just cobit nothing to do<br>with all the zero interest rates and uh<br>spending um we'll wait and see but for<br>europe where debt is high uh inflation<br>uh is a serious problem so you know as<br>if any reminder when they<br>needed the value of fiscal prudence uh<br>and a clean balance sheet um<br>new zealand's going to win uh relative<br>certainly to europe and a lot of other<br>countries in the oecd coming out of this<br>well i agree with that now but just one<br>i guess<br>question mark and that is uh what russia<br>does over the coming weeks and months<br>and then what the response might be<br>okay that could potentially have<br>profound implications uh for<br>oil markets and gas markets uh with with<br>long-term um uh increases in fossil fuel<br>prices which may be good for climate<br>change in the long run<br>but but uh won't be good for global<br>inflation<br>isn't it wonderful to be in a country<br>that's crowned at a 40 percent and not a<br>100<br>um my gosh<br>nervous times in italy of a thought<br>and i think we're going to have to wrap<br>this session up now but of course these<br>topics including inflation will be<br>picked up again tomorrow tomorrow um<br>when we have adrian orr um presenting to<br>to us um<br>huge topics i know we've only had time<br>to scratch the surface of of some of<br>these um and we certainly haven't got<br>into the data issues and we've really<br>focused more on on new zealand than<br>global inequality and that's a whole<br>story and it's in its own right as well<br>and i'm not sure whether your response<br>to the covert question would have been<br>the same if the question had been on<br>global global inequality um but you know<br>thank you so much for your very very<br>rich insights the expertise that you<br>bought the um<br>uh reminding us of this new data that's<br>just out jonathan and and uh matt<br>reminding us not to take our off that<br>housing market because that really<br>matters greatly for uh for income<br>disparities in new zealand so thank you<br>so much thanks also to our audience you<br>guys have been sending the questions<br>through slido um really appreciate those<br>and<br>with much gratitude thank you very much<br>to our panelists<br>thanks</p></main><footer
