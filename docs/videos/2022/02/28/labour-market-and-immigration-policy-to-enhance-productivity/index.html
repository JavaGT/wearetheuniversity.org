struggling to<br>shift the dial on productivity<br>and i will hand back across to stephen<br>joyce who's going to facilitate this<br>discussion for the next panel stephen<br>over to you thanks very much matt and a<br>very good previous panel no challenge to<br>our new panelists<br>to to get the discussion going as<br>strongly as that but we'll we will<br>definitely give it a decent crack<br>we have two<br>uh i would say<br>valuable uh<br>participants in this debate firstly<br>we have john gibson professor of<br>economics the waikato management school<br>and simon chapel who's the director of<br>institute for governance and policy<br>studies at victoria university of<br>wellington the subject is the labor<br>market immigration policy to enhance<br>productivity and the labor market has<br>already become quite a<br>strong theme through this<br>conference forum to date and the reason<br>for that is there's so much change going<br>on certainly covert has caused a fair<br>bit of it in terms of closing the new<br>zealand labour market off from the rest<br>of the world for the last two years<br>but we also have a government that has<br>made absolutely no secret that it wants<br>to change immigration policy and quite<br>significantly<br>and we have<br>labor market policies internally<br>which also signal quite significant<br>changes and depending on your<br>perspective uh they're either long<br>overdue or a worrying return to rigidity<br>in the labour markets take your pick<br>and so to try and make sense of this for<br>us<br>we have john gibson and simon chapel i<br>should note that simon unfortunately has<br>a technology issue in wellington um<br>hopefully unrelated to what's been going<br>down there with the protest so he'll be<br>coming to us in audio only<br>meanwhile john gibson looks like he's<br>actually orbiting the planet at this<br>point with his uh<br>with his uh backdrop so john uh uh<br>welcome to you with your uh excellent<br>perspective from above us all<br>um could you uh launch into it and uh by<br>the way gentlemen uh about seven minutes<br>each to lay out your stall and then<br>let's do the discussion thanks very much<br>john<br>uh perfect thanks very much stephen so<br>ukraine's actually just at the back of<br>my shoulder if you can see uh there and<br>we might talk about that in a moment so<br>over the last four censuses in new<br>zealand the foreign-born share has gone<br>from roughly one in six people 18<br>to now more than one and four people uh<br>26<br>uh and it's worth thinking about how<br>unusual that is if we compare ourselves<br>with um<br>small oecd countries and so countries of<br>around about you know between two<br>million and six million eight million it<br>doesn't really matter uh almost all of<br>whom are<br>right behind me in this picture of<br>europe at night um<br>they've seen almost no change in the<br>foreign lawsuit and so in new zealand<br>we've now got twice as large of a<br>foreign-born share<br>as our comparative countries if we<br>compare ourselves of australia australia<br>has always had a larger foreign-born<br>share but we've basically very rapidly<br>closed the gap and so the foreign-born<br>share in new zealand proportionately<br>rose 44<br>while in australia it only rose 26<br>and if you think about it for a moment<br>then<br>it's pretty clear this is almost<br>entirely policy driven rather than being<br>driven by economic fundamentals and so<br>the distance or the time it takes<br>someone to fly from new zealand to<br>sydney three hours once we can do it<br>again<br>within europe someone deciding to move<br>to europe to a small oecd country there<br>can cover 750 million people and so<br>you've got a large market you've got a<br>market which is much richer and which<br>actually has seen much faster<br>productivity growth and so it's<br>surprising that we've got such a strong<br>inward growth in migration from from the<br>stocks i prefer working with the census<br>compared with comparators<br>and at the same time as as you know and<br>as many people watching will know our<br>productivity record has been pretty<br>dismal so we hide that partly by working<br>longer hours and so the correct way to<br>look at this is in real gdp per hour<br>worked and<br>compared to the top half of the oecd<br>which is something we once aspired to<br>rejoin uh we're working about 67 as<br>productively and so gdp real gdp per<br>hour worked in new zealand is only about<br>two-thirds as high as it is for the top<br>half of the oecd<br>if we compare ourselves to the bottom<br>half and the bottom half includes a lot<br>of these small countries in europe which<br>up until 30 years ago faced really bad<br>incentives under central planning well<br>they've got far far higher productivity<br>growth and so it's only greece and<br>mexico for whom our productivity growth<br>has been better<br>and so we've had this massive growth in<br>immigration we've had this stagnant<br>largely stagnant productivity growth and<br>what growth we have had in productivity<br>has been primarily in the primary sector<br>and it primarily occurred in the 1980s<br>and the 1990s in the early post-reform<br>era not in the period since 2000 and the<br>other symptom and i talked about this<br>last year is that we're an increasingly<br>inward-looking economy and so the share<br>of foreign trade to gdp in new zealand<br>is far lower than it is for other small<br>oecd countries and it's going down<br>rather than up and so we're getting more<br>and more inward looking we're focusing<br>much more on the non-traders<br>particularly on on housing real estate<br>and that's again a sign of an economy<br>which isn't terribly productive and<br>isn't terribly um competitive in some<br>sense and so again it makes it<br>surprising that uh we would have such<br>strong inward migration compared with<br>places which are doing doing much better<br>now the problem is and and the<br>hypothesis that the inward migration is<br>raising the real exchange rate which is<br>skewing incentives towards the<br>non-tradable sector is very closely<br>associated with michael riddell former<br>reserve bank economist<br>i'm a microeconomist rather than a macro<br>economist and so<br>it's difficult for microeconomists to<br>look at macro evidence and say well you<br>know am i fully convinced by this<br>because the standard of proof is quite<br>different between things and so i'm<br>going to talk about two micro um bits of<br>information which which people may or<br>may not know and which might be relevant<br>to this so the first one relates to<br>housing and so what we've seen is that<br>um for a standard deviation higher um<br>foreign-born share in new zealand at the<br>very small level at the aerial unit<br>level which is the suburb level then we<br>see the native born home ownership rate<br>go down by one-sixth of the standard<br>deviation and much of it occurs not<br>directly but through spillover effects<br>and so if we're going to have a big<br>inward migration push then having really<br>restrictive land market settings in<br>urban areas uh as matt burgess just<br>talked about was really inconsistent<br>with that and so we've got the worst of<br>both worlds<br>the second<br>little bit of micro information i'll<br>talk about because it's not all doom and<br>gloom on migration programs and they're<br>not all cut of the same cloth<br>from the get-go of the rse the<br>recognized seasonal employment scheme uh<br>then i've been involved along with the<br>world bank along with david mckenzie<br>along with people in wellington and<br>analyzing them and so we do see pretty<br>big productivity effects of that<br>particular migration scheme and so when<br>we were able to look at physical<br>productivity how many uh apples or how<br>many grapefruit or other things that<br>people were picking the foreign workers<br>were picking 50<br>more or more productive than the new<br>zealand contract labor and about 80<br>percent more than the casual labor<br>backpackers and so there was a really<br>big micro level productivity shock and<br>that showed up at the sectoral level<br>because we have about 1 billion dollars<br>per year pre-covered uh extra exports<br>from kiwi fruit apple and wine which are<br>the three big sectors affected by rsc<br>um and last year or late 2020 there was<br>a report by nz-ier which fed into the<br>productivity commission which emphasized<br>the idea of substitution but actually<br>when we look at this particular example<br>then there's much more story about<br>complementarity because most of the<br>employers who had now a guaranteed<br>source of labor from the rse workers<br>from vanuatu and so forth then expanded<br>and actually we're employing more new<br>zealand workers as well and so it's a<br>rather more complicated picture than<br>than we typically get<br>so<br>because you asked me to to<br>speculate or contemplate on the issue is<br>this a good time for us to keep the door<br>shut and i would argue that actually<br>despite the the macro level productivity<br>story it's not necessarily a terribly<br>good time to keep the door shut and<br>there's a kind of smugness if i'm going<br>to put it there then and last year ellen<br>bullard used the kind hermit kingdom it<br>might now be the smug hermit kingdom<br>rather than kind her kingdom where<br>people assume people in new zealand<br>assume that we can just turn the tap on<br>or off because of course people want to<br>come here and it's not clear to me that<br>that's that's true it's not clear it was<br>ever true and it's certainly not clear<br>that it is true currently and so just<br>even thinking about seasonal migration<br>for the moment when new zealand first<br>set this scheme up australia struggled<br>to get theirs going and dick bedford<br>emeritus professor here at the<br>university pointed out that once<br>australia got their scheme up and<br>running they would be a preferred<br>destination for many pacific island<br>workers and indeed that proved to be<br>true and the disruptions to covet is<br>going to make that even more so<br>but the big picture here is that<br>starting three decades ago the world<br>economy<br>basically absorbed a huge meal of<br>opening up a new frontier of labor which<br>was a billion workers who were stuck<br>previously behind the iron curtain and<br>behind really bad incentives of central<br>planning in china and eastern europe and<br>certainly with some disruption it<br>absorbed them<br>brought about this era of globalization<br>brought about a really big fall in<br>absolute inequality across countries but<br>very disruptive within countries um and<br>now it's looking for more labor so it's<br>no surprise that china is very very<br>active in africa and it's not just there<br>for raw materials it's there for<br>youthful labor markets because it's run<br>out of labor the east asia region of the<br>asia development bank is going to see<br>the working age population fall by 200<br>million people between now and 2050 and<br>so there's a huge competition for labor<br>it used to be just the skilled level but<br>it's increasingly at the at the less<br>skilled level as well and it's just not<br>at all clear that we're as well<br>positioned as we think we are to just<br>automatically turn on the tap and find<br>that there's the swelling supply and so<br>with that i'll i'll leave it um for for<br>simon to pick up great great work thank<br>you john um and a lot there to digest<br>i've written down about four things i<br>want to come back to which we'll see if<br>we manage in the time available um simon<br>you've been listening to john there um<br>it'd be interesting in your perspective<br>at this point uh let's try and keep it<br>to the seventh i think john almost got<br>to ten minutes but try and keep it to<br>the seven uh and um and then we'll get<br>time for some discussion at the end<br>simon<br>right thank you stephen and thank you<br>john um<br>i i guess my starting point is to say<br>that new zealand has a long-run history<br>of relatively poor productivity that<br>probably dates back to the uh the second<br>world war<br>and in the biggest picture we've had two<br>broad explanations for this one is we've<br>basically had poor government policy be<br>that spend tax regulate<br>the second explanation is the tyranny of<br>distance<br>argument that that john has has touched<br>on um<br>in terms of the<br>small economies in europe and the<br>distance from major markets<br>we also need to be aware that<br>productivity here is not to be all and<br>end all of well-being it's important but<br>policy doesn't start<br>we'll stop there<br>so if we're thinking of policy uh behind<br>poor productivity to what extent can we<br>conceive of immigration as a policy<br>solution<br>economic theory says the simplest model<br>of immigrations is that uh there's a<br>relatively small immediate gain from<br>immigration there is a big<br>redistribution from<br>the uh factor that's becoming uh less<br>scarce to the scarce factor<br>but in the longer term<br>with constant returns we're simply<br>replicating uh production processes at<br>infinitum with immigration<br>uh so no no gains in the long term uh<br>the minute you complexify it the<br>conclusion gets more complicated um but<br>your best bet for a productivity impact<br>from immigration is if<br>people who come in uh bust up production<br>functions they come in with new ideas<br>new ways of doing things and they<br>innovate<br>um<br>the<br>challenge of course is that<br>we have great difficulty in identifying<br>those people in the first instance and<br>in the second instance ensuring that<br>they<br>come to new zealand<br>uh in terms of the evidence we have<br>john's touched on some of the uh recent<br>relationship between very high rates of<br>immigration<br>and<br>a lack of a productivity response and<br>this is not really very surprising<br>because if we look at the income survey<br>data from the household labor force<br>survey we find that on average<br>immigrants earn pretty much the same or<br>slightly lower wages than new zealanders<br>as a whole so that suggests on average<br>they're about as productive as the<br>average new zealander we're not going to<br>get a big immigration gain there all the<br>evidence suggests if you're going to run<br>an immigration policy you want to get<br>people who are not like the average you<br>either want people at the bottom end of<br>the labor market who are very different<br>from the average or the top end of the<br>labor market<br>obviously they have very different<br>now<br>the issue further issue<br>sorry<br>is if we don't have access to<br>the sorts of scale economies that europe<br>has because we don't have the population<br>can we get there through a big new<br>zealand strategy well if we had three<br>times our population we had 15 million<br>people we would still be 15 million<br>people miles from anywhere so the short<br>answer is no it's highly unlikely that<br>big new zealand is going to overcome the<br>in terms of<br>a couple of the issues raised by john in<br>terms of census data we need to be aware<br>that in addition to<br>more people coming over the border<br>as citizens or as residents we've had<br>enormous growth in people coming to new<br>zealand temporarily with a right to work<br>and in fact the growth here has in some<br>cases been larger<br>working holiday visas have exploded<br>students who have the right to work in<br>new zealand uh those numbers have<br>exploded in some ways it almost like<br>seems like we're selling the right to<br>work in new zealand rather than the the<br>right to study so numbers have been very<br>large<br>uh in terms of<br>what's happened through the covert<br>lockdown which is a really interesting<br>experiment um<br>we observe ourselves with<br>a rate of unemployment that it's<br>historically<br>at its lowest level since we first<br>started collecting the data in 1986.<br>correlation of course is not causation<br>and the reserve bank indeed has argued<br>that the structural unemployment rate uh<br>has risen as a consequence of no longer<br>being able to use migrants to fill skill<br>shortages<br>now if that was the case we would<br>anticipate in the current environment<br>seeing a lot more wage pressure if<br>structural unemployment's gone up but<br>we've got<br>wage inflation at the moment massively<br>lagging consumer price inflation in a<br>very low unemployment environment so<br>it's not<br>a plausible<br>story<br>where i get to overall on this is that<br>broadly speaking<br>migration is very second order in terms<br>of our productivity<br>yes we do need people and i would argue<br>we need people who are at the high<br>school the end of the distribution we<br>probably could do with fewer people<br>than we've had in recent times<br>the issue here is in terms of<br>productivity do we buy the smarts from<br>overseas or do we build it in new<br>zealand<br>and i think historically we have seen<br>buying the smarts as a reason for not<br>doing building well in this country we<br>need to focus much more on building the<br>skill sets of people in new zealand in<br>doing that effectively rather than<br>trying in effect the last vestige of<br>central planning in new zealand is<br>picking winners in terms of immigrants<br>we've tried it it hasn't worked<br>particularly well we need to focus on<br>the real things<br>but building people<br>thanks steven thanks john thank you<br>simon um great start everybody just want<br>to pick up on one thing<br>because happened already today somebody<br>else has said that we're not seeing any<br>wage inflation yet isn't it possible<br>that we're just not measuring it yet<br>certainly anecdotally<br>and maybe it's just in the industries i<br>walk in but wage inflation<br>is about to hit us fairly hard i think<br>going on the construction sector going<br>on uh the professional services sector<br>uh the farming sector you know we're<br>starting to rack it up so maybe it's<br>just not showing in the numbers yet<br>would you say that potentially<br>um i i'm uncertain about that i think<br>you can tell a plausible story along<br>those lines every time new wage data<br>comes out though i'm struggling to see<br>it in the data<br>so one story is the sort of the long and<br>variable lag story which the reserve<br>bank is running with and it's possibly<br>true<br>a second story is that and and this is<br>one i've recently started running is the<br>new public sector act effectively gives<br>massive monopsony power to the public<br>sector commission and is therefore very<br>effective in screwing down public<br>servants wages which effectively are<br>frozen and this is spilled over into the<br>private sector since the private sector<br>don't need to compete with the public<br>sector and so in fact the public sector<br>act has been very good in terms of<br>lowering the rate of unemployment at<br>which we can comfortably operate<br>so that that's one possible story uh<br>there but i mean i guess stephen the<br>proof of the pudding there is going to<br>be in the eating over the next year to<br>18 months whether that wage pressure<br>genuinely starts coming through uh and<br>the reserve bank have indicated in their<br>position okay well let's leave that<br>there at the moment because i don't<br>think we can answer it we could we could<br>trade anecdote for anecdote i'm sure for<br>some time um gentlemen the the<br>this<br>what does what does good look like i<br>mean how real is this isolation argument<br>because i i've been grappling with it<br>you know the time that i was in<br>government and there's no doubt about it<br>this country is a long way from markets<br>some would say that our high levels of<br>productivity historically post world war<br>ii<br>uh and leading up to britain joining the<br>eec was really because we were uh<br>located right next door to the uk we<br>were britain's farm and and there was<br>effectively we as soon as they joined<br>the ec we were shunted off to the south<br>pacific in geographical terms and<br>haven't been back since uh is is it<br>realistic even uh what or what are the<br>tools that we can pull to to to to<br>defeat this you know geographic<br>isolation i mean or is it a case of we<br>are where we are john first<br>it's true that that certain costs have<br>fallen dramatically for spatially<br>transacting what we're doing at the<br>moment right so we've got some people in<br>wellington and so forth but um the the<br>paradoxical<br>um argument is that because of that then<br>what we demand becomes ever more complex<br>and so many of the things which require<br>um actual face-to-face have put more of<br>a premium and so rather than being the<br>case that you know the the thomas<br>friedman the world has become flat the<br>argument is very much that actually the<br>world became more and more curved and<br>and location became much more important<br>and of course we were in the wrong place<br>you raised the point you know what what<br>levers can policymakers pull so a few<br>years ago david mckenzie who's a new<br>zealander at the world bank and i uh<br>surveyed the best and brightest from new<br>zealand and a few other countries and so<br>these are people that all central<br>planners and immigration would love to<br>have as inward immigrants you know they<br>were math olympians chemistry olympians<br>daxes of good schools and and so on and<br>so forth and by age 40 for the new<br>zealanders it's about a three-way split<br>so a third of them are overseas and are<br>pretty much going to stay overseas and<br>that included david<br>about a third of them have been overseas<br>would have come back and about a third<br>of them have never been overseas for<br>long-term work or study so they've<br>they've they've stayed in new zealand<br>throughout and the people who came back<br>which are really the target market for<br>some of these questions um leave a lot<br>of money on the table and so they could<br>be earning around about a hundred<br>thousand dollars per year more overseas<br>than they earned in new zealand and so<br>we asked them you know what was it that<br>attracted you back and none of it was<br>things that you and your former role or<br>your credit or your<br>successes could do anything about<br>because it was a chance to have the<br>growing up experience that they<br>experienced connecting with family and<br>so forth now what's happened for two<br>years is all of those things if they're<br>overseas have really been um unavailable<br>to them and indeed again the sudden<br>smugness almost of saying well you<br>deserved it because you went overseas<br>you you betrayed us and so you know this<br>is the basis of the grounded kiwis case<br>and so forth there's really very little<br>that policymakers can do to to attract<br>and alter these flows uh and so i think<br>we've just got to be a lot more<br>realistic about how undesirable in some<br>ways we are and obviously people are<br>going to say oh look at that guy he's<br>just talking us down but it's just the<br>reality of where we are compared with<br>where the rest of the world has moved<br>okay now what about you simon uh on the<br>on the issue of how real is this<br>isolationism and what what policy levers<br>can be pulled to counter not<br>isolationism sorry isolation<br>yeah i mean really interesting i've got<br>kids who are in their mid to late teens<br>and<br>obviously as a parent i'd love to have<br>them still in new zealand they perceive<br>massive opportunities overseas compared<br>to new zealand which of course i i did<br>too and i took advantage of those<br>opportunities but there's another push<br>factor and it harks back to the previous<br>session my kids are utterly convinced<br>that they will never be able to afford a<br>house in this country and the only way<br>that they will be able to afford to own<br>a house will be going abroad<br>and these are a 16 year old and the 18<br>year old<br>so you know even as simple things as<br>getting the housing market right are<br>really important now i'd like to chuck<br>in an anecdote that that in some<br>respects um beefs up john's one i worked<br>for a portion of my academic career on<br>the<br>child longitudinal study and<br>it it tracks all the children born in<br>the cohort of about a thousand kids at<br>wherever they go around the world<br>and<br>we thought that these people would go<br>overseas in their their twenties and<br>then they would bounce back in their<br>late 20s well that didn't happen they<br>stayed overseas the interesting thing<br>however as they got older they relocated<br>and they relocated from the northern<br>hemisphere to the southern hemisphere<br>so you might be working in london and<br>new york but you don't come back to<br>auckland or wellington or dunedin you<br>come back to a major australian city<br>and uh so the other reason that people<br>go overseas is for the amenity value of<br>lots of other concentrated numbers of<br>people around there are the arts there's<br>listening to interesting people<br>uh talk there is the whole big city vibe<br>auckland is an overgrown medium-sized<br>city<br>australia offers at you know sydney and<br>melbourne are truly international cities<br>so those are all challenges we as a<br>country have to overcome i think john's<br>right the principal attraction is to get<br>new zealanders back is uh you know the<br>chance to grow up in<br>you know the society and this culture<br>i'm a pessimist on on this one generally<br>speaking i think uh there's probably<br>relatively little we can do as a country<br>to<br>permanently shift our productivity<br>growth rate we can do things that<br>improve our productivity level<br>but i do not see a higher long-term<br>growth rate arising out of anything<br>policy makers in wellington can do<br>okay<br>that's um sobering um i would note too<br>that of course auckland um a city that i<br>live in uh often thinks of itself as<br>pretty big but it's the fifth largest<br>city in australasia and doesn't like to<br>be reminded of that<br>because you're making an exactly right<br>point i've got a brother who's just<br>returned to sydney<br>and<br>so many people do exactly that<br>one of the questions from our audience<br>is what would<br>oh here's a chance for you guys to write<br>the policy what do you think giving your<br>comments about the limitations of public<br>policy nevertheless<br>politicians have to do things right um<br>so in terms of designing an immigration<br>policy post covert<br>because we are in this rather unique<br>position where it's been stopped and now<br>gets to start again<br>um and obviously in wellington they're<br>talking about pulling the levers um<br>they're very excited about the<br>opportunity to construct a new<br>immigration policy so what would you two<br>do<br>uh and what would be what would be your<br>approach to to attracting that high<br>skilled uh labor force<br>but also ensuring local school upgrading<br>uh and you know the comments that simon<br>was making earlier about grow your own<br>as well<br>and i think we can definitely take that<br>as a desirable thing and i know from<br>years as minister of tertiary education<br>that just doubling the number of<br>engineering graduates took a huge amount<br>of uh heavy lifting uh but nevertheless<br>there's definitely a need to do that so<br>what would you do let's start with start<br>with simon<br>uh what would i do well first of all i<br>would get rid of any rights that uh<br>students have to work in new zealand so<br>if you're coming to new zealand you're<br>not going to be operating in the low<br>school end of the labor market to the<br>detriments of<br>others who operate in that labour market<br>and equally<br>the right to work<br>working holiday visas i think tend to<br>create a dynamic at the bottom of the<br>labour market where we've got 300 000<br>new zealanders who are plus who are on a<br>welfare benefit which we need to<br>provide as much incentive as possible to<br>get work<br>we need to think about why it is that we<br>get so many migrants in the middle of<br>the income distribution<br>um and we need to think much harder<br>about exactly who do we want to buy and<br>what what are the set of skills in new<br>zealand where it is not worth our while<br>spending money educating<br>um people<br>um<br>and i'd like to finish stephen by<br>picking up on your politicians to have<br>to do things well no they don't have to<br>do things doing nothing is always an<br>so so<br>again there are limitations here about<br>what politicians<br>can actually do and and sometimes it's<br>worth not pulling on a lever because in<br>effect<br>the negatives overwhelm the positives of<br>of of punting a ball into the dark we've<br>punted a lot of bulls into the dark in<br>new zealand in the last 30 years in<br>search of the the chimera which will<br>unlock the<br>treasure trove of productivity and we've<br>been incredibly unsuccessful in<br>unlocking that so maybe there isn't uh<br>that treasure trove out there i was<br>being slightly mischievous in that in<br>that comment but um but nevertheless uh<br>it's interesting because i think you<br>know your comments there sounded quite<br>central planning in terms of you know<br>who we should train and in what areas<br>i mean isn't that the difficulty here uh<br>that it's the individual choice we have<br>to counter we have to cater to and it<br>seems that the reality of for example<br>fruit picking in in in our fruit picking<br>regions is such that unfortunately a lot<br>yep that that that that's absolutely<br>true uh they don't and so the question<br>arises is it better that we reallocate<br>the resources that are currently in the<br>the fruit industry and put them<br>elsewhere where there may be longer term<br>options for productivity i think uh<br>there's very much mentality amongst new<br>zealand employers which has only grown<br>in the last decade or so<br>that they have a right to<br>what arthur lewis called unlimited<br>supplies of labor at the going real wage<br>what that does is encourages a employer<br>mindset in the strategy that focuses on<br>replication<br>as opposed to innovation<br>because there's no induced innovation by<br>saying oh my god it's costing me a lot<br>more to hire workers what are new smart<br>and different ways of doing things as<br>opposed to i've got a business model<br>that works and if it stops working i'll<br>knock on the government store and i'll<br>let more workers in<br>right john respond to that thank you<br>simon and also those questions i asked<br>simon as well john so you've got your<br>magic wand um<br>thanks<br>so so i think the first thing that needs<br>to be done is to raise the standard of<br>what counts as a valuation in in<br>wellington but more generally right so<br>so we've got um some migration programs<br>which i think we can make a plausible<br>argument for that they<br>enhance our comparative advantage<br>sensible things to do they don't<br>necessarily put terribly<br>large resource strain on resources in<br>central cities and i'm thinking<br>particularly of the rsc but what's<br>required to evaluate and make that claim<br>is is far beyond what typically passes<br>for evaluation we think of you know<br>provincial growth fund or all sorts of<br>things and it's just<br>it's frankly terrible right so so the<br>nobel prize in economics in 2021 and<br>2019 both went to what we would call<br>better ways of working out did x cause y<br>well so much of what politicians want to<br>do is first of all they want to play<br>with the x's as as you and simon have<br>pointed out but they would like some<br>evidence that well did x actually cause<br>y okay and and what counts as evidence<br>in new zealand has often been pretty<br>weak and so we need to first raise the<br>standard of that now of course an<br>academic would say that because we think<br>that's going to be more more work for us<br>but once we've done that then we can say<br>okay let's go through all of these<br>various types of migration let's go<br>through student migration let's go<br>through family reunification migration<br>let's go through<br>uh unskill well lower skilled seasonal<br>work let's go through top talent which<br>one of these seem to be ones which are<br>actually having an impact and which ones<br>don't that would be the basis of<br>building and unfortunately we've got<br>into an equilibrium where we really are<br>almost evaluation free uh where you know<br>major major changes are done and and<br>there's some you know<br>um not terribly um rigorous uh x post<br>well it looks like it improved<br>well-being well well i'm i'm i'm not<br>convinced so yeah<br>can i respond very briefly to that<br>stephen and go and say that i 100 agree<br>with what john's said<br>our quality of our feedback loops in<br>this country is incredibly poor<br>and that's actually become a theme uh<br>through the day we were discussing this<br>in the business uh session earlier um<br>same sort of discussion about the<br>quality of not in that case the quality<br>of implementation which i think also<br>comes to real question look thank you<br>very much for your time we're out of<br>time uh well i know we've only just<br>scratched the surface but you've<br>certainly stimulated some discussion i<br>hope some of my former colleagues in<br>wellington um get a chance to<br>see this session perhaps over the<br>weekend<br>but thank you both very very much indeed<br>and thank you uh simon for persevering<br>despite the technology challenges<br>and we'll catch up with you both again<br>soon<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
