into a session on<br>education of course<br>any of us i know as a parent education<br>of the kids in my house has been pretty<br>disrupted over the last couple of years<br>many people are going through changes<br>and challenges it's always a fascinating<br>topic here at a university<br>anyway i'm going to hand over to the<br>moderator for this session professor eva<br>collins<br>another member of the waikato management<br>school team eva we're in your hands<br>thanks matt<br>uh tennokoto katoa as matt said this<br>forum is being hosted by an educational<br>institution so you can imagine the<br>interest in what this next panel has to<br>say<br>keeping to the now familiar format<br>after introducing the panel and giving<br>them a chance to make some opening<br>comments we'll take questions from slido<br>and also we're letting in encouraging<br>the panelists to ask each other<br>questions<br>we have until 2 30 to explore<br>educational issues in covid<br>so on to our panel our panel includes<br>alex fernandez de alevera chief<br>investment officer at the international<br>finance<br>corporation professor don klinger pro<br>vice chancellor division of education<br>university of wakato<br>and dr michael johnston<br>senior fellow at the new zealand<br>initiative and senior lecturer in<br>education at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>so over to you alex to get us started<br>thank you eva and first of all thank you<br>very much for for the opportunity and<br>the invitation it's my first time<br>attending the forum a little<br>disappointed that we're not uh in person<br>in hamilton but but hopefully um for the<br>next one<br>i thought i'd use these initial minutes<br>to talk a little bit about ifc i<br>realized that many people in attendance<br>might not be familiar with whom we are<br>and and what we do<br>talk a little bit about<br>my role at ifc<br>and then sort of leave a<br>a high level message<br>that is hopefully useful in<br>in starting the the panel discussion<br>so ifc is the private sector arm of the<br>world bank group<br>we share the same development objectives<br>as the world bank itself<br>but we work exclusively with private<br>sector so all of the investments we make<br>all of the projects we engage with are<br>driven by private sector no<br>government<br>interference<br>we are active across a whole range of of<br>industries<br>our last fiscal year we did about 30<br>billion<br>dollars worth of investments<br>and we<br>do<br>sort of a full range<br>of financial<br>investments from senior loans to<br>straight equity<br>and i think the other feature is or two<br>important features<br>one is we only work in emerging markets<br>so we work with companies from all over<br>the world but the projects they are<br>investing in have to be uh in emerging<br>markets<br>and<br>the second angle you know<br>we are a development institution so<br>way before sort of the the concept of<br>impact investing<br>was was developed we had already been<br>doing it so all of our investments we<br>have to justify the financial return<br>but also some measure of broader good<br>uh to the economy to to a a a society a<br>particular country<br>er that's that's sort of part of our<br>role<br>i lead our<br>health and education investments across<br>asia<br>the theme that binds health and<br>education together is for us development<br>of human capital our view is countries<br>cannot develop unless they're able to<br>accumulate<br>a human capital and health and education<br>are both<br>critical pillars<br>in<br>stimulating<br>helping countries i guess develop<br>a human capital<br>we do<br>in education which is this afternoon's<br>topic we have today a portfolio of about<br>a billion dollars<br>most of it out to higher education<br>institutions that's been<br>typically our focus more than primary<br>and secondary education although we have<br>invested in in primary and<br>secondary uh<br>education<br>schools<br>fairly well uh diversified portfolio uh<br>significant in latin america significant<br>in asia<br>but also a middle east in africa so a<br>fairly balanced geographically very<br>balanced uh<br>education portfolio<br>and i think the the<br>the the<br>key uh sort of<br>uh<br>message um<br>as i mentioned we we work with with<br>private sector<br>and in emerging markets what we have<br>seen i think our experience has been<br>that the private sector actually<br>contributes quite a bit<br>to strengthening local um education<br>systems at one level it's just a sheer<br>you know additional resources<br>fiscal situation<br>in many of the countries we work in is<br>challenging colvit has not helped<br>and private sector uh<br>you know brings<br>additional resources<br>which uh tend to to<br>strengthen education systems in in these<br>countries i think the the the other<br>angle<br>um<br>is<br>i would say if i had to summarize our<br>strategy for<br>uh investing in education in private<br>education in emerging markets<br>we're trying to support institutions<br>that<br>provide relevant education and typically<br>help<br>young people<br>obtain relevant jobs i think that is<br>at the core<br>what we see as as sort of our strategy<br>what we see as as our objective help<br>especially young people develop the<br>skills that are relevant in the job<br>market and as a result<br>obtain relevant employment<br>and i think in our in our experience<br>private sector plays an important role<br>uh<br>establishing i would say better links to<br>labor markets<br>tailoring education<br>that is more relevant<br>to to the job market and as a result<br>uh<br>i would say helps this transition<br>from sort of from school<br>to to the workplace<br>we don't see it as<br>one or the other it's not public versus<br>private our experience has been i would<br>say that private sector complements uh<br>uh very well in in many of the countries<br>we work in sort of a public sector<br>efforts in<br>in promoting education<br>that was a lot um i hope it was clear<br>but i'll stop here in terms of opening<br>remarks and<br>pass it over to<br>to the panel<br>thank you alex that was very clear and<br>and helpful to hear about ifc's role and<br>and your discussion about the<br>opportunity for private uh sector<br>investment and education<br>let's now turn it over to dawn for his<br>danakoto katoa<br>and as eva mentioned i am the professor<br>i'm professor don klinger i'm the pbc<br>for<br>tewananga toitanganda division of<br>education at the university of hokkaido<br>um<br>you may have also quickly surmised that<br>my own story did not begin in in new<br>zealand i prior to coming to the<br>university of waikato i was in canada<br>with experience as an as an educator and<br>an academic researcher in the field of<br>educational measurement<br>um i've long been interested in the uses<br>and misuses of large-scale testing<br>and and also the factors that impact<br>student success and i've looked at you<br>know whatever however we defined uh<br>success i mean i think there's lots of<br>ways we can talk about what success<br>really looks like<br>um i think what you'll see from the<br>panelists i mean there's a lot we agree<br>on and you know i've actually done some<br>work with yaga khan foundation which is<br>also a private organization that funds<br>educational initiatives so we've worked<br>as a panel to try to really highlight<br>where we're coming at this from<br>different perspectives<br>so with that<br>um what i'm going to talk about here is<br>my central argument is that the<br>challenges of covid<br>and what what its impact has been on<br>education<br>is<br>the solution to it has to be<br>in the ways we support and help public<br>education<br>i don't think the solutions are going to<br>be in the private sector the same way<br>that the other panelists are going to<br>talk about<br>um<br>now you know before you dismiss me as<br>one and this just another one of those<br>left-wing socialists that has no<br>understanding of finances or economics<br>uh please know i've long argued that<br>education does have to be more like a<br>business uh too often educators talk<br>about you know they're different than<br>this they don't have to worry about<br>finances i've never bought into that<br>argument<br>we are a resource intense industry and<br>therefore we have responsibility to<br>really think about our how we use those<br>you know i have<br>a background in finance in business<br>i also worked in a school system<br>where we had school-based<br>decision-making and so i saw when ed<br>schools can become what i call resource<br>pits and we just can't have that<br>so as i said i've always had the<br>position i used to get in big debate<br>with colleagues around this whole<br>position around you know our schools a<br>business<br>you know i would argue they're not a<br>business but that be business-like as<br>i've just said<br>um<br>where i do struggle with some of the<br>economic philosophies in education is<br>when it's centered around the notion of<br>competitive structure rather than of<br>what i would call a fundamental social<br>responsibility framework and i think<br>this is where i'm going to push some of<br>my my work<br>and i'll talk about this from the work i<br>do on statistical modeling and education<br>and over the past several years i've<br>really looked at<br>you know models of educational outcomes<br>uh what predicts them uh what are the<br>things that seem to impact student<br>achievement or student outcomes whether<br>it be health and well-being uh physical<br>education<br>um<br>you know belongingness all sorts of<br>issues success outcomes like that<br>um<br>and<br>what i've what i've been telling people<br>and i've said this a lot if you want to<br>see the best education system in the<br>world go to the usa just look to the u.s<br>there's a reason the u.s has got more<br>nobel prize winners than the next six<br>at the same time i've also said if you<br>want to see the worst education in the<br>world<br>go to the u.s<br>the u.s is a really strong model it's a<br>competitive model where you have massive<br>educational equities and so the work i<br>do is called hlm hardcore linear<br>modeling and if you can see what we<br>typically see is the us has a growth<br>curve like this the top performing<br>schools are right up top<br>and the lower performing schools are<br>quite low there's a big difference<br>in the us the school you go to<br>the schools that you go to really matter<br>on your educational outcomes<br>now in contrast to that we look at<br>countries such as finland and canada<br>and they've been they have very high<br>educational standards they do extremely<br>well on pisa<br>assessment and in the other kind of<br>assessments that are out there but you<br>also find much greater equity<br>so if i show the graph like the us is<br>there<br>the graph for canada is basically like<br>that<br>now what you will see is that in canada<br>the peak is typically not as high we<br>just don't have the same high high<br>top-end schools that the us has we have<br>one or two<br>but what we don't have are big<br>differences at the bottom in fact in<br>canada and the same in finland the<br>school you go to doesn't really matter<br>you'll get a high quality education in<br>now there are issues that we talked<br>about in canada about raising that bars<br>that you get everything higher<br>and the reason i talked about this is<br>the second reason both canada and<br>finland do not have a large private<br>school system they're very much a public<br>system<br>now statistically alterate new zealand<br>looks more like the u.s than either<br>canada or finland<br>now i'm painting i won't say an<br>artificial picture but i'm highlighting<br>some big differences but i have to be<br>open and honest here<br>even in canada and finland there's<br>massive inequities<br>uh we regardless of the educational<br>outcomes we measure there's a large<br>proportion of students we're not meeting<br>the standards we want for children they<br>feel they don't belong uh their academic<br>achievement is below uh they're<br>connecting it to school uh is missing so<br>we get between about 15 and 30 percent<br>of our children just don't feel<br>it's like it's less in canada but it's<br>still there<br>now it's these eq inequities<br>sorry these inequities are not random<br>they're systematic they're systemic<br>we see them across certain population<br>groups in certain communities in regions<br>uh you can imagine some of them already<br>you know if you think about about new<br>zealand itself<br>and<br>i think it's not hard to argue that<br>covid and its long tail will really<br>likely exacerbate these existing<br>inequities<br>there's a long list of factors that<br>contribute to these inequities under<br>covid<br>teacher readiness in their their own<br>skills in dealing with online learning<br>home learning resources that children<br>have access to whether it be books<br>computers<br>ipads<br>chromebooks<br>broadband internet<br>dedicated learning spaces uh either in<br>the community or in the home<br>uh family and community supports<br>i mean many of us here we're well versed<br>in how to support our children under a<br>number of different challenging<br>circumstances that's not equally<br>distributed across our populations<br>and these are all critical factors but<br>also they're ones that are largely are<br>the control of the students themselves<br>it's not their fault<br>and yet they're the ones that have to<br>struggle with the<br>implications of these inequities<br>so<br>what i'm arguing is we have to<br>differentially distribute resources to<br>our schools in order to address these<br>inequities<br>especially as a result of coving<br>and this is where the competitive<br>education models are really challenging<br>these models tend to<br>reward prior success<br>and it's a classic case of the rich get<br>richer<br>not a bad model for businesses perhaps<br>but it's not really a strong model in<br>education<br>what we actually need to do is to direct<br>the resources and research supported<br>professional learning as well to those<br>educators to those educators in the<br>public system who are best situated to<br>address these inequities<br>where are the problems how do we get<br>support into those schools into those<br>communities<br>we already have evidence that this kind<br>of model works<br>uh the province of ontario and canada<br>did use something called the ofip<br>project was called the ontario focus<br>intervention partnership<br>and what they did is they identified the<br>lowest performing schools and they<br>directed<br>research-based professional learning to<br>their teaching staff<br>and other resources community to support<br>the performance of students in this case<br>in literacy and numeracy on critical<br>outcomes in those areas<br>and as a result what they found was that<br>those schools that and it wasn't<br>universal by any means this is not a<br>simple solution but what they did find<br>that in many of those schools they were<br>able to move themselves well out of that<br>bottom<br>what they call quartile range into the<br>you know they still weren't above<br>average but they were moving up towards<br>average performing schools<br>and i think this is the same kind of<br>structure we have to think about as we<br>deal with a coveted tail<br>we've got 15 to 30 percent of our<br>students that are really going to<br>struggle and these are the ones that are<br>going to have the the biggest challenges<br>uh catching up<br>and meeting the standards we need for<br>so there's<br>thank you don um and what i like about a<br>panel and particularly an afternoon<br>panel<br>is one that<br>represents a broad range of perspectives<br>on the important issues so don i<br>appreciate<br>uh your<br>the view that was quite different from<br>what alex just presented<br>our final speaker in the panel is<br>michael so over to you michael for your<br>comments<br>thank you very much aber um<br>i'm really going to i think build<br>largely on what don has said and on the<br>issue of public sector and private<br>sector involvement in education i<br>probably sit somewhere between the first<br>two speakers i i certainly take on board<br>don's point about the<br>risks of<br>a system which has<br>a private sector within the public<br>domain<br>exacerbating<br>educational inequality i saw it in<br>action when i was<br>at university of melbourne lecturing<br>there<br>nearly 20 years ago<br>most of the students who got into that<br>university were private school educated<br>and<br>certainly the private sector is much<br>more involved in education there<br>than it is in new zealand and in general<br>i would like to see<br>a public school system that is well<br>funded and that does a good job of<br>teaching children what they need to<br>thrive in the world i think it's<br>if it's working well it's a very good<br>way of overcoming<br>intergenerational poverty<br>um however uh<br>there is the crux of it is it working<br>well uh is it delivering those outcomes<br>and at the moment there's great deal of<br>evidence in new zealand that our system<br>is not as don said we resembled the<br>american system in some ways and and<br>that is<br>a very large gap between<br>the the students who are doing the best<br>and the students are doing the poorest<br>we have some large<br>socioeconomic and ethnic gaps in our<br>educational data and this is something<br>that ought to concern us<br>um<br>and as don also said you know<br>this inequity has it has its<br>sources beyond the control of the<br>students themselves but also in fact<br>beyond direct control of schools a lot<br>of the time the socioeconomic factors<br>that play into things and as don also<br>said i think that it's almost inevitable<br>that the covert lockdowns will have<br>exacerbated educational inequality for<br>almost obvious reasons despite the fact<br>that we haven't seen any hard data on it<br>yet i think that's going to turn out to<br>be so<br>so what can we do about it<br>well one thing you know<br>that we need to be aware of and where i<br>think<br>the private sector uh<br>may keep the public sector honest to it<br>to an extent<br>is in the provision of high quality<br>teaching and learning<br>so if the public's school system can<br>provide<br>teaching and learning of equal quality<br>to what you can get in a private school<br>why would anybody spend 25 000 a year to<br>use a private school<br>or maybe for snob reasons but not not<br>many people you know have so much money<br>they can afford to to spend it on that<br>so if we can<br>uh<br>equip the public school system<br>with what it needs to to do<br>as well as those private schools then<br>there shouldn't be an issue um<br>and to that that extent i think it's<br>good that there are private schools<br>there as an element of competition if<br>you will so that we can measure<br>something against<br>uh what the public schools are capable<br>of<br>so there are some problems<br>in in the system and they're not all<br>related to money that's the thing it's<br>we could spend a huge amount of money on<br>the public school system and have better<br>teacher student ratios and better<br>resources and you know this wouldn't be<br>a bad thing but however there's some<br>things that we can do that are not going<br>to cost all that much in<br>comparison uh that could improve things<br>markedly<br>and a lot of that has to do with just<br>following evidence<br>so<br>i think for one thing um we need to look<br>at what is taught in schools<br>so<br>i'm quite a fan of the critical realist<br>educational school of thought which uh<br>perhaps the biggest thinker in the world<br>is michael fd young who's a british<br>educational philosopher and sociologist<br>and<br>he had an insight that really what we<br>need to do<br>inequality that affects education is to<br>make sure that<br>all students but especially those from<br>disadvantaged<br>communities have access to powerful<br>knowledge<br>and powerful knowledge he he said are<br>things like mathematics and science and<br>literacy and<br>as well you know things like english and<br>history so the disciplines of our<br>cultures that<br>ground us you know in in<br>where we've come from and also<br>in<br>what we need to do to test ideas<br>so things like science for example<br>obviously is about testing ideas using<br>evidence<br>and<br>these are the things that i think we<br>need to emphasize as coherent bodies of<br>knowledge<br>and we can get into perhaps in question<br>time where some of that is is lacking<br>um but the other thing that we need to<br>focus on is the pedagogy of teaching<br>itself and make sure that we're doing it<br>in the most effective possible way<br>and at the moment we're just not<br>there is<br>at least two decades maybe three decades<br>um for which we've been teaching<br>literacy in a way that<br>really doesn't work optimally well<br>in spite of having an enormous amount of<br>evidence from cognitive psychology and<br>related disciplines about how to teach<br>reading effectively<br>and that creates these<br>these socio-economic gaps in in learners<br>because those who have home resources<br>will still do all right but those who<br>really need<br>the sound science of learning behind the<br>pedagogy they experience in schools will<br>often struggle<br>so<br>that may be a a good place to conclude<br>my opening remarks and we can we can<br>start to have some discussion<br>thank you michael i appreciate that um<br>so<br>each of you touched on this topic and<br>looking through the slido questions it's<br>the one that<br>comes up most of all and i encourage<br>participants to keep keep those<br>questions coming through<br>the the worry that i'm seeing through<br>the questions and is about the um<br>exacerbation of inequalities<br>um through covid especially for our most<br>vulnerable<br>so michael you said something a little<br>controversial there about uh it does it<br>takes more than money uh but i i'd like<br>to just unpack this a little bit more<br>from each of you about what how how are<br>we gonna address these growing<br>inequalities<br>shall i<br>go in there yeah so i mean it will take<br>some money it takes money to do just<br>about anything of course<br>but i don't think it takes the sort of<br>massive resources that parents put into<br>private schools say when they when they<br>you know buy a place for their child in<br>a private school<br>uh it takes a ministry of education that<br>will use<br>an evidence-based approach to uh advice<br>to teachers it takes<br>faculties of education who will train<br>teachers according to that advice<br>and according to the evidence<br>and<br>that actually you know doesn't cost very<br>much at all it's just a change of tack<br>in terms of how we approach<br>preparing teachers to teach<br>and um<br>what what actually happens in schools<br>when we teach things like literacy and<br>numeracy<br>so that's why i say that it needn't be<br>we could get a lot of bang for it for<br>not that many bucks for it that way<br>alex or don would you like to come in on<br>this<br>yeah i mean i think uh for me<br>i mean i agree it's not purely a money<br>situation<br>in terms of throwing cash at the system<br>especially depends on the nature the<br>problem is if it's still a problem of<br>students living or trying to learn<br>online<br>i think that needs money we've got to<br>get systems to them broadband and that<br>that's an infrastructure issue<br>i think if we've got students that need<br>to be schools catching up what we<br>actually need is exactly what michael's<br>talking about and that's an influx of<br>really<br>strong professional development for our<br>teachers that they can use while working<br>with students so it can't be a one-off<br>type of professional learning it's got<br>to be something that's going to last for<br>the next two years to help work with<br>their students<br>um<br>you know<br>covert has been impacting us for now for<br>for two and a half years<br>well two years now it's going to be it's<br>going to be for longer it's going to<br>take that long to fix it as well so i<br>think we've got to play the long game<br>and that is work with schools<br>that have seen these real inequities<br>surface<br>and then get some good science teaching<br>science behind them and working with<br>those teachers to implement those kinds<br>of structures to help their students<br>succeed<br>you know we talk about resilience i<br>don't like that term<br>but<br>you know students are able children are<br>able to learn and they can learn<br>effectively with good teaching so i<br>think it's really about solving that<br>problem making sure they get the best<br>teaching possible in those in the<br>situation and it might look different<br>than what they're used to<br>probably in fact it will<br>okay<br>i'll come in<br>i guess from a slightly different angle<br>but the first<br>um<br>you know not wanting people to walk away<br>with the sense that you know ifc were<br>unscrupulous uh<br>you know capitalists uh<br>not at all i think this issue of equity<br>and education is is front and center um<br>in in our thinking<br>um<br>in all of our investments uh without<br>without exception<br>uh they are<br>relatively speaking<br>accessible perhaps not to the very very<br>base of the pyramid to the extent that<br>we<br>the companies we support charge tuition<br>but don't think of the institutions we<br>support is sort of<br>accessible<br>only to the elite of a particular<br>country<br>it's<br>we<br>strive and help these companies actually<br>reach<br>as far as they can uh down down down the<br>pyramid um<br>look<br>i think<br>i think we're all still<br>learning about this i<br>a little bit of the evidence that i've<br>seen uh<br>studies done by the world uh bank itself<br>i think the impact is significant the<br>past couple of years have not been kind<br>uh to<br>primary and secondary students all over<br>the world in my sense it<br>makes and that makes sense the less<br>resources a particular system had the<br>worse their kids have been hit<br>and i don't know i mean<br>don and michael<br>are<br>the education experts i i come at this<br>from a different uh point but<br>in in my mind<br>you can't make up for lost time without<br>investing more time so there's no magic<br>bullet that you can get these kids<br>and just you know do something<br>and recoup the past couple of years<br>unless they stay you know twice as long<br>in school<br>which then for a number of other reasons<br>is unlikely to happen uh one thing one<br>area<br>and we might not be in full agreement<br>technology can help<br>i think<br>short sometimes of being able to afford<br>a private education what we have seen in<br>many of the countries we operate in<br>is sort of<br>uh<br>remedial<br>services tutoring services<br>that leverage technology and make that<br>available um to<br>to<br>to kids at scale it's not an ideal<br>solution by any uh stretch of the<br>imagination but to the extent that<br>um you know your kids are more or less<br>forced to attend an underperforming<br>system<br>and you're short of alternatives this is<br>better than nothing<br>and i i say this with with<br>uh<br>caveats and reservation<br>but i think the gap that's been created<br>these past couple of years will not<br>magically disapprove<br>and i think the only way to address this<br>is remedial services and there i think<br>technology has has a role to<br>play that's a that's a good segue<br>because the probably the second most<br>common theme in the questions on slido<br>is about technology and specifically<br>about online learning<br>with one questioner uh controversially<br>suggesting that with the disruptions<br>maybe we should just go completely<br>online<br>um so<br>uh maybe not going that far but it'd be<br>interesting to hear<br>michael and don because alex has just<br>talked about this about what your views<br>about technology is specifically online<br>learning and what's the role there<br>yeah of course sorry you go down<br>i i think it's an interesting one i<br>don't think online learning is a<br>solution to all of our problems<br>i think it's a it's a good technical<br>resource i think it has some real value<br>um<br>you know i i think<br>you know let's talk about industry and<br>and what what our industries need and<br>what our commercial enterprises need and<br>i don't think we want a world where<br>everybody's working online either<br>there's a real skill set i mean when we<br>look at graduate profiles what what<br>industries and<br>businesses want from their<br>graduates its communication skills its<br>ability to work in groups and teams<br>i think online learning really struggles<br>to create those kind of atmospheres to<br>do that again especially for some groups<br>of students<br>so i think we have to be careful on that<br>you know one thing that<br>will be important<br>is you know as as i've said it's going<br>to take time to fix it there's going to<br>be a requirement for<br>tertiary education and businesses to<br>provide some of the opportunities for<br>learning also now how to work in these<br>different kinds of environments as well<br>so you know technology on its own won't<br>solve it unless we have really good<br>systems in place to help people<br>integrate that into the everyday<br>workplace and learning in higher ed<br>yeah i agree with that i mean i think we<br>have to distinguish between<br>technology in general and you know kids<br>learning on zoom or something<br>i think<br>you know zoom<br>it's been a necessary evil i mean look<br>at us we're here today on so we probably<br>couldn't have this conference without it<br>so it's certainly better than nothing<br>but um i think it's one of the main<br>reasons why<br>um we will see an exacerbation of<br>inequality um as a result of cohort and<br>i i do not want to see my children or<br>other children<br>learning on zoom or in these kinds of<br>environments<br>schools are social places and that we<br>must never forget the huge importance of<br>social learning i feel immensely sorry<br>both the primary and secondary students<br>are at different stages of their social<br>learning and i've had that badly<br>disrupted<br>and and i agree with alex that we will<br>not see<br>the the<br>the legacy of this disappear quickly uh<br>unfortunately it's so it's going to be<br>with us for a while uh the worst thing<br>we could do is carry on as if you know<br>this was a good thing because<br>while some people you know i think it<br>goes to actually to the whole experience<br>of lockdown itself there are people here<br>in wellington who have secured jobs in<br>academia and the public service sitting<br>at home in their nice houses<br>working away quite comfortably there are<br>others in crowded accommodation<br>losing their jobs losing their<br>livelihoods losing their minds and that<br>there's no way to live and there's no<br>way to learn<br>so but yes technology can certainly help<br>us i mean literacy is a technology has<br>been with us for thousands of years and<br>it's a massively important one for<br>education so of course we should be<br>looking at new technology and what it<br>can offer us<br>but not at the expense of<br>being together as people and the the<br>relationship that is uh<br>absolutely at the heart of teaching and<br>learning<br>so<br>i don't want to see us perpetuate<br>anything that comes from the covert era<br>i want to see us try to put it behind us<br>and as alex said it will take a while i<br>do think that if we<br>focus hard on<br>some of the things that we haven't been<br>doing as well as we might<br>like<br>you know effective teaching based on the<br>science of learning if we started to<br>really put that into place with with<br>gusto and enthusiasm then we could catch<br>up somewhat because<br>tragically for some time we have not<br>been<br>as effective as we could be by any means<br>in some of the basics of education so<br>we could accelerate things if we started<br>to do that<br>he agreed<br>thank you michael and you touched on um<br>the the social fabric and the importance<br>of the social fabric and i want to<br>switch gears a little bit uh and and<br>cover another important aspect of<br>education that's come through on the<br>slido and that's about the query is what<br>insights does the panel have<br>on teachers mental health and workload<br>issues<br>and is there a crisis around losing<br>teachers which relates to the<br>immigration panel from the economics<br>forum um and then importantly what are<br>the solutions so so going um to the<br>alex do you want to start<br>don<br>uh certainly<br>new zealand with its mandates has<br>certainly had a<br>sudden loss of the teaching force<br>um due to the current mandates<br>um<br>i mean it's an interesting profession i<br>think people that go into teaching uh<br>learn or the ones that survive learn<br>early on it's a stressful position a<br>profession that takes a lot of time and<br>effort<br>uh<br>so<br>you know i think they're ready for that<br>and they've done well where the real<br>struggles have come has certainly been<br>let's see<br>the uncertainty that comes across as as<br>many of us have experienced and having<br>to then teach also both in online and in<br>person environments<br>i think that's challenging any of us<br>have tried it they've really found that<br>as well<br>and i think it just that extra<br>additional time that teachers are facing<br>um there's another hidden one that's out<br>there and you see this again we're a<br>caring profession you know to our<br>strength into our weakness at times<br>there's many again the research isn't<br>great on this but there's lots of<br>anecdotal evidence of teachers spending<br>time in the evenings with their students<br>and trying to support them in families<br>in crisis as well so they're giving up<br>their own health and well-being for<br>their families to support other families<br>in crisis<br>so i think this is where the<br>the unknowns are certainly are there and<br>we have to really watch for that uh i<br>think principals are doing a good job<br>monitoring it but many of us don't say<br>i have a phd student who's<br>commencing a<br>project on<br>burnout and teaches<br>and you know she's been in schools for a<br>while she she teaches yoga actually it's<br>one of her<br>things and<br>um<br>so she's coming at it from a perspective<br>of what can be done to mitigate<br>as don says what is intrinsically quite<br>a stressful<br>uh profession<br>uh i do think that<br>there's been<br>an issue for a long time<br>which has again been exacerbated by the<br>coveted situation<br>the amount of pressure that the teachers<br>work with and and while i think<br>there is inevitably<br>because you're dealing with young people<br>you're dealing inevitably that there are<br>social problems that come into your life<br>that<br>your students are having<br>because of things that are happening<br>in their households or in their<br>communities that<br>those issues<br>are hard to deal with<br>by their nature i'm not sure that we do<br>enough to support teachers in what<br>they're expected to do i think schools<br>are now you know becoming more and more<br>almost social work centers as well as<br>educational centers to an extent perhaps<br>they always have been but you know we're<br>seeing schools feeding children who<br>don't have breakfast these kinds of<br>things and you know these are good<br>things to do but<br>we have to recognize the amount of<br>pressure that that puts on<br>uh education workers<br>and the extent to which<br>burnout is a danger and<br>then we do lose people from the system<br>and that that's terrible because you<br>lose experienced people and it's<br>terrible for them because first of all<br>they lose<br>their profession because they can't cope<br>with it anymore and also they've got a<br>legacy of<br>anxiety and depression to deal with so<br>i don't know what the answers are to<br>this um but it's something that a<br>problem that we need to recognize and<br>try to grapple with<br>thank you michael um alex we have just a<br>few minutes left and i'm keen to hear<br>your views on this topic so so and very<br>very briefly um<br>look and this is more anecdotal from the<br>experience of some of the education<br>institutions that we've invested in<br>so<br>we monitor and talk to them often right<br>and remember that we work in emerging<br>markets<br>so countries with much more challenging<br>environments than new zealand or<br>or the us europe etc<br>and i think that in these countries<br>where there's virtually no safety nets<br>unfortunately what we saw are schools<br>closing because<br>you know if<br>if the teacher him or herself or<br>somebody in the family is ill or<br>there's just no alternative<br>and so he or she cannot show up<br>that happens to a few people the schools<br>are closed and we have seen<br>so again anecdotal but<br>evidence but schools in india shut down<br>for months on end um and that's as i<br>said that there's no<br>you know there's not<br>in connectivity is an issue so as bad as<br>the zoom class<br>that that my kids<br>had to sit through that's not available<br>it's a real loss<br>i i think it is a huge issue<br>in general it is not<br>unfortunately a profession that is<br>better remunerated across the world<br>certainly in emerging markets<br>um and in countries with no with very<br>little safety net the<br>not not in a bad way but the students<br>pay the price because the school<br>yeah i i just want to agree with what<br>alex is saying as well i mean<br>i have worked in pakistan and in<br>tanzania and<br>certainly in those areas<br>you know the challenges are so much<br>greater<br>for all those reasons so it's all the<br>problems we're talking about are even<br>bigger there<br>and so we we end this conversation on<br>the the inequities that that we started<br>with with covid um and we've covered a<br>lot of ground i really appreciate and<br>want to thank our panelists for their<br>input and and um has given us lots to to<br>think about so thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
