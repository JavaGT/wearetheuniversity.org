the last 24 hours<br>and in particular in<br>europe with russia invading the ukraine<br>and pretty much as we speak tanks<br>heading across<br>the ukraine countryside<br>which probably does change slightly the<br>tenor of our<br>discussion today<br>obviously we want to be cognizant of of<br>what's happening there we do also want<br>to get the more macro issues and i'm<br>sure our panel will do that for us<br>and and the impact of of what we're<br>seeing on our on on<br>decades-long trends like globalization<br>and so on<br>anyway we have three excellent panelists<br>for this discussion firstly uh from the<br>university of new south wales professor<br>gigi foster professor of economics who's<br>joining us live from sydney thank you<br>very much gigi from doing that<br>we have<br>rodney jones principal economist and<br>analyst at wigram capital advisors<br>and we have the honourable tim gross a<br>former minister of trade<br>and climate change issues but also a<br>long-standing diplomat with quite a lot<br>of experience in around the world<br>including in europe now we're changing<br>the batting lineup slightly today on<br>what we've planned i will get gigi to<br>continue to go first tim's going to come<br>in second and probably do a bit more<br>specific<br>stuff around russia and ukraine and and<br>the impact of that although gigi you're<br>most welcome to to to start with that<br>and then rodney is going to look a bit<br>more specifically at the china situation<br>and and perhaps some lessons um through<br>there now i've talked to all the<br>panelists ahead of time we're going to<br>do sort of five to seven minutes uh and<br>uh each and again the aim of the<br>exercise is to have a good discussion<br>for about a half of our time and so<br>there's a chance to sort of uh lay out<br>the the key arguments and then we'll<br>come back to them so gigi thank you very<br>much for your time and over to you<br>my pleasure thanks for having me and uh<br>thanks for uh forging ahead with this<br>conference despite the uh the online and<br>in-person uh you know debate that was<br>going on for a while um so i wanna use<br>my five to seven minutes to focus on the<br>things that uh i think are most<br>important for the antipodes going<br>forward we'll speak a little bit about<br>russia and ukraine but um the main thing<br>that i think is important to bear in<br>mind is that the last two years have<br>been a<br>catastrophic policy ball drop they have<br>been uh very very<br>bad for the economies and the welfare of<br>both australia and new zealand and so<br>the best thing that we can do going<br>forward for our economies is to exit the<br>covet madness as quickly and uh sort of<br>methodically as possible while uh<br>reassuring people that this is the right<br>direction to go in because we have<br>basically um paralyzed people with fear<br>and and really hurt them<br>in terms of their perspective on uh<br>covet and other health problems and we<br>need to help them to recover some sense<br>and to be able to then<br>activate their their consumption<br>investment behaviors as they need to be<br>activated in order to grow our economy<br>is going forward so um the first thing<br>is to drop all of these restrictions<br>about covid that are are limiting<br>business and consumption activity all<br>over the antibodies uh well again<br>reassuring people and i think that some<br>use of things like on-the-spot testing<br>or<br>you know other kinds of uh<br>very easier i suppose methods to<br>reassure people are much better than<br>border restrictions and<br>mass mandates or the kinds of mandates<br>um that are really distracting from what<br>new zealand and australia needs to work<br>on going forward so that's the first<br>thing second thing is that as part of<br>our covet policy um response<br>we have seriously disrupted many of the<br>industries that australia and new<br>zealand have relied upon in the past and<br>that really play to our comparative<br>advantages immigration uh tourism<br>education the arts and entertainment of<br>course but you know all of these these<br>things uh maybe with the exception of<br>arts and entertainment rely heavily on<br>borders being open and uh people being<br>able to freely move about and and<br>of course as well and so um from my<br>perspective and i think that the<br>politicians here in australia do see<br>this i'm not sure whether that's the<br>case in new zealand but i think we have<br>to refocus on on making our countries um<br>an appealing place to work study do<br>business uh and live<br>and so we need to uh try to get rid of<br>the the brand uh image that we have at<br>the moment of uh you know very scared<br>populous uh with a lot of control<br>response to anything that's potentially<br>going to be threatening uh not very much<br>risk tolerance and uh and not a very<br>friendly place to be if you happen to<br>get caught here when there is a crisis<br>because you will not be uh treated very<br>well you'll be turfed out as our<br>temporary migrants and ours our students<br>were at the height of coven<br>so i think we need to repair our brand<br>damage basically repair the image of the<br>brand of australia and new zealand and<br>uh try to encourage as much uh<br>immigration as possible and and tourism<br>and students coming back and and all of<br>that if we don't do that see the issue<br>is not that the economy is necessarily<br>going to sink in the short run in fact<br>we see here in australia that the<br>unemployment rate is very low um you<br>know the the gdp doesn't seem to be you<br>know taking as much of a knock as people<br>have expected although that's always the<br>an inner ears number that we that we<br>collect and release here um but it just<br>doesn't seem that there's the the<br>evidence yet in these kind of standard<br>statistics that we've really hurt<br>ourselves um but in the long run without<br>immigration we will grow more slowly we<br>will become more parochial and there's a<br>danger of being more xenophobic and i<br>think other countries in the world like<br>for example scandinavia um the the uk<br>who are dropping those restrictions will<br>not suffer those longer-run effects and<br>so over the longer run australia and new<br>zealand risk being left behind so that's<br>my mind is the main danger um very<br>briefly the other things that i'm<br>looking at the labor market is a very<br>interesting uh phenomenon at the moment<br>um people are re-evaluating where they<br>want to be in the labor market they're<br>changing their hours up um there's<br>obviously been so much disruption that<br>new choices are possible sometimes new<br>discoveries of technology have been made<br>which i think will stick um that's fine<br>but uh i don't think we're going to get<br>back to the levels of productivity that<br>we were looking at pre-covered for<br>another probably a couple of years um<br>natural resources of course is a huge<br>issue for the antiquities for australia<br>particularly in iron ore for example for<br>new zealand i suppose you have your<br>sheep um and a lot of other things and<br>so i keep an eye on the iron price and<br>of course that comes down to how much<br>construction is happening overseas<br>including in china um and um yeah the<br>debt repayment um that of course is<br>going to have to happen which will crowd<br>out other kinds of expenditure i worry<br>that that may uh<br>also you know drag the economy down and<br>human welfare down with it now on russia<br>and ukraine um i from my perspective is<br>a bit of a useful distraction at the<br>moment for us to be thinking about<br>something other than covid i i wish it<br>weren't a war<br>um but i think that maybe it will help<br>some people to recover some sense about<br>what's actually important and uh and and<br>speed our exit from the the covert<br>madness i think i'll leave it there<br>okay<br>thank you very much gigi um i'm sort of<br>sensing that you think um some of the<br>health response is overwhelmed the<br>economic response<br>for covert we'll come back to that<br>definitely<br>let's go and talk a little bit more<br>specifically then about<br>russia and ukraine and the impacts<br>globally<br>we we have seen uh dramatic scenes uh in<br>the last 24 hours and i'm sure we'll see<br>more in the next 24 hours tim grosser is<br>a former diplomat and uh foreign a trade<br>minister who is very familiar with that<br>part of the world tim<br>i know i asked you late this morning<br>whether you could change your comments a<br>bit to give us a bit more of that flavor<br>i hope<br>i didn't catch you too much by surprise<br>no not at all stephen<br>and thank you for inviting me on this<br>panel um i'm gonna start with an<br>anecdote which i think has certainly<br>become very topical because i happen to<br>be in moscow<br>at the time the russians started this<br>process of trying to<br>redraw the map of the ukraine<br>so<br>i had<br>a long-standing relationship with<br>essentially russia's chief trade<br>negotiator when i was still um wto<br>ambassador and chairman of the global<br>agriculture negotiations in geneva<br>and i wrote a think piece for his boss<br>elvira naviolino who was then the<br>minister of commerce and now she's the<br>governor of the central bank of russia<br>but she's going to have her hands full<br>in the next two to three months<br>so i said to them look you'll eventually<br>get into the wto and join that global<br>system but that's only half the game<br>why don't you do what china has done<br>take this small apec economy in new<br>zealand and create your first fta<br>and to my astonishment they said yes<br>so um<br>two years later it took a long time to<br>negotiate i'm up in moscow i do a deal<br>with an outstanding russian uh<br>intellectual um julio chaof who is now<br>in jail for eight years on trumped up<br>corruption charges by president putin<br>and<br>i<br>finished the negotiation in moscow and i<br>texted the prime minister john key and<br>said do you mind if i<br>miss the cabinet meeting next week<br>because i need to be here for a signing<br>ceremony he texted me back and said no<br>problem congratulations see you on your<br>return<br>so i went out partying in moscow with<br>the ambassador and his team<br>didn't read the news and on monday<br>morning i turn on my ipad<br>to find that the lead item in the new<br>zealand<br>main media was prime minister orders<br>trade minister grosser to return from<br>moscow immediately<br>and i'm thinking well what the hell has<br>that got to do with his last instruction<br>what i did not realize<br>was that they had in the previous 48<br>hours started this process of<br>dismantling the ukraine<br>and it was obviously in both the prime<br>ministers eventually my view not going<br>to be a good look if a small western<br>country and member of the five eyes<br>arrangement was seen in pravda front<br>page smiling signing a trade russia's<br>first ever trade agreement with an apec<br>economy after they had done this<br>now i think we<br>need to understand that that process of<br>integrating russia into the global<br>economy via both<br>the wto<br>which took them i think 12 years to<br>negotiate their way in there and then<br>eventually into apec and the agreements<br>that are sort of associated with the<br>apec framework<br>is part of the broader picture we're<br>debating today which is the post-war<br>global<br>era<br>and we shouldn't forget for example that<br>the<br>resignation of the<br>pro-russian president of ukraine in 2013<br>i think<br>uh early 2014 yanukovych<br>uh was actually sparked by his refusal<br>to sign a comprehensive trade agreement<br>the eu<br>so i'm not the only analyst that is<br>commenting on these terms<br>the raster of essentially three pillars<br>of globalization in the post-war era<br>one is respect for sovereignty and in<br>particular not no attempt to redraw the<br>lines<br>of<br>boundaries established after the war<br>because it has trapped ethnically<br>comparable people behind different<br>political configurations<br>the second was<br>to enforce peace through u.s lead<br>deterrence and security agreements and<br>the third was inside each sovereign<br>country was you know a movement towards<br>respect of human rights peaceful<br>transfer of power democracy largely<br>defined<br>so all of these things are part of the<br>post-war global era and they're all<br>under pressure<br>and<br>um<br>my story about the collapse of this fta<br>is i think a sign of the times that we<br>are under and i'm very concerned about<br>it stephen uh primarily because i'm a<br>great devotee of uh robert kagan the<br>so-called neocon although i don't find<br>that label particularly revealing<br>who<br>whose recent book about two years ago<br>the jungle grows back at the very title<br>suggesting globalization<br>is slowly under massive pressure<br>and fundamentally it all comes down to<br>the united states<br>all of this was underwritten by the<br>massive relative power of the united<br>states<br>as kagan points out many of his<br>writings liberal ideas have been around<br>since the enlightenment for centuries<br>the only reason they succeeded after the<br>catastrophe of two<br>european-initiated wars in the 20th<br>century was because for the first time<br>they had massive relative power to<br>enforce those liberal principles<br>and now we see the united states in real<br>trouble they withdrew from tpp when i<br>was ambassador new zealand ambassador in<br>washington i witnessed that disaster of<br>american policy<br>they<br>are occupying essentially an empty seat<br>approach in the wto and i spent 11 years<br>of my life in the wto and the gat before<br>that<br>and i think we're under a lot of<br>pressure frankly on the institutional<br>frameworks of globalization i think it's<br>not about collapse um<br>i could elaborate on that if you're<br>interested but i do think we need to<br>recognize that we are living in very<br>uncertain times<br>and i'd like to finish my introductory<br>comments by referring to a quote that<br>anyone has ever been a student of<br>globalization would have come across<br>it's a very famous quote from keynes<br>it's brilliant<br>polemic the economic consequences of the<br>piece when he said something like i<br>don't have the quote in front of me but<br>an english gentleman this is could prior<br>to the outbreak of world war in 1914 sit<br>in his bed and drink coffee from<br>plantations and salon<br>order more investments in argentinian<br>railways and so on so in other words the<br>pre-world war one globalization era and<br>of course it all came down to a<br>shattering collapse as the consequence<br>of war<br>because at the end of the day<br>globalization is a political construct<br>yes it's driven by technology and by<br>profit maximization and the search for<br>business opportunities but it runs<br>through the arteries of certain<br>political understandings keeping a<br>global trade and payment system open and<br>they right now stephen are under a lot<br>of pressure<br>okay thank you very much tim will come<br>back um and address<br>where they might go<br>uh with with the the russian invasion of<br>ukraine and what might happen next<br>in fact and our next guest may comment<br>on that as well uh rodney jones is the<br>principal economist and analyst at wigan<br>capital advisors he has a long history<br>of uh working in china for a range of<br>clients<br>and has been a a<br>china watcher for a long time but i also<br>understand has much broader knowledge of<br>the of of the<br>geopolitical world as it relates to<br>relates to business and economics<br>rodney thank you for joining us<br>uh these are indeed strange times what's<br>i've spent the morning revising um all<br>since<br>4am ukraine time yesterday revising what<br>i was going to say<br>like what tim grossa said that keynes<br>quote i i come at globalization as an<br>economist<br>and so<br>and again look back at that 1870 to 1913<br>period where you had free movement of<br>capital labor and goods<br>and that all came to a crashing end in<br>world war one<br>and<br>then<br>you know part of the reason the uk went<br>back on the gold standard in in the 20s<br>was to try and recreate that world<br>in a sense we're in a similar position<br>now<br>um<br>and i that's the what framing we've been<br>going thinking in terms of and that the<br>pandemic represented that sort of break<br>now it appears either you know that<br>seems a bit trite given what's happened<br>in ukraine in the last 24 hours and so<br>it kind of reminds you of that hemingway<br>line that you go back up two ways<br>you know slowly then suddenly or<br>gradually then suddenly<br>and that has been the path of<br>globalization it's been<br>this slow unwinding and it was<br>fascinating to hear the story from from<br>tim about crimea and new zealand's fda<br>because living in china at that time<br>you know that 2014 2015 period was a key<br>turning point in terms of the south<br>china sea<br>the rise of xi jinping the the move away<br>from collective leadership<br>and<br>that culminated in 2017 with the end of<br>term limits and she now this october<br>or more likelihood they're going to have<br>a third term<br>and so<br>what we've got is now we've got this<br>accelerated<br>downward shift in in globalization<br>i'll come to some of the domestic<br>economic factors that are working in<br>china but first of all i think just<br>because of what's happened we need to<br>turn to kind of russia china<br>and i think when the history of this<br>period is written<br>february 4 or loom is a large date and i<br>think it's a small country like new<br>zealand um that's a very challenging<br>what's happened is extremely challenging<br>that was a joint statement<br>from<br>between putin and xi jinping<br>where two things stood out from that<br>um they're friends with no limits<br>and there's no forbidden areas<br>well within three weeks<br>uh putin has tested<br>that new definition of friendship<br>there was some hope yesterday<br>that she had been caught off guard by<br>this and that we would see some<br>commentary from the ministry of foreign<br>affairs in china<br>unfortunately when wang spoke to lavrov<br>he kind of affirmed<br>that<br>china was sorry that russia was acting<br>on legitimate concerns around security<br>and so this means today<br>and i've always never done this in<br>public so this is the first time i've<br>i've spoken in public on this is that we<br>do need to now start talking about<br>taiwan because in some ways<br>the the joint agreement<br>and then immediately followed by an<br>invasion of ukraine<br>establishes the cause valley from from<br>china's perspective and so this is you<br>know somewhere where you know we haven't<br>wanted to go that we're going to have to<br>start thinking about those dynamics and<br>that's something new<br>but for right now that's still in the<br>future<br>um but it's it's a new factor in the<br>equation that i've tended to downplay<br>myself<br>domestic factors have been um really<br>important there's these<br>the factors around the economic policy<br>in china that we associate with kind of<br>diminishing globalization and that's<br>common prosperity we've seen the climb<br>down on the tech and property sectors i<br>kind of i tended to remain quite<br>optimistic<br>until<br>you know early last year that china<br>could still grow fast even with this<br>shift towards going prosperity<br>that's now misplaced so we've kind of<br>got the market in retreat in china and<br>the state-owned enterprises on the march<br>and the state with that advancing<br>so we've got internal dynamics in china<br>that means it's turned it turns inwards<br>and as gigi kind of referred to<br>kovid has had this turning inward effect<br>in a lot of countries you know including<br>new zealand australia but particularly<br>in china and the xero covet keeps that<br>in play we now have an opportunity to<br>kind of exit our policies over coming<br>months<br>in china as we see in hong kong they're<br>doubling down on zero covert and what<br>we're seeing in hong kong just a brief<br>comment there<br>um<br>they've used cyanovac for about half<br>their vaccinations and it looks like<br>it's it's completely ineffective on<br>may be less effective than previous<br>studies have suggested so hong kong is<br>looking at very high death rates hong<br>kong universities talking about 7 000<br>our modeling suggests 10 to 15 as<br>possible but certainly omicron's going<br>to spread and is likely to spread into<br>the mainland and so we've now heading<br>ahead in china to a year dominated by<br>covert policies by zero covert<br>which means we have another year of<br>training and wood<br>so it's<br>um<br>a lot to absorb<br>but that's my initial comments<br>thank you very much rodney thank you to<br>all our panelists for that initial<br>comments<br>so we're doing<br>a sort of a bit of a stock take<br>listening to the three of you one thing<br>that's quite apparent is<br>the absence of us leadership in this<br>most recent period in different ways<br>and<br>and and<br>particularly in the around the around<br>the uh the world the world order the the<br>wto for example<br>uh and<br>and uh you'd have to say in the last 24<br>hours i mean like completely<br>understandable that they're not rushing<br>to go into ukraine but uh<br>but but again a sense of u.s impotence<br>and i and i sit there look thinking<br>about that and thinking well gosh russia<br>is about the 12th largest economy in the<br>world these days it's smaller than italy<br>it's not much bigger than australia<br>economically<br>and<br>and yet here they are thumbing their<br>noses at the world um and and this is a<br>the question really becomes i suppose<br>what's<br>you know<br>has the west lost its mojo and i don't<br>mean it not mean that in terms of<br>militaristically but just in terms of<br>economically in terms of its sense of<br>direction uh and<br>um<br>and and where are we where are we going<br>with this over the next little where's<br>global trade going are we going to see<br>a reduction in trade or particularly in<br>services trade uh or are we or we is the<br>west in a position that it can re<br>recover and reassert<br>uh these what have been global norms<br>ever since world war ii so there you go<br>gigi just a quiet couple of questions um<br>your thoughts<br>um well i mean we certainly have seen in<br>the last two years a significant<br>reduction in um services even within<br>countries not<br>not<br>even covering between countries um i<br>think that the opportunity exists for<br>countries that see their writing on the<br>wall to actually move proactively to try<br>to reignite and reactivate their<br>comparative advantages<br>in the global economy which still exist<br>it's still true that australia just is<br>going to have a comparative advantage in<br>natural resources it is going to have a<br>comparative advantage in services within<br>a western uh english-speaking<br>environment for people who want that um<br>so you know that that doesn't go away<br>the economic realities don't go away and<br>i'm you know i did study a bit of<br>politics in school but i am very much<br>constantly an economist and so i'm<br>thinking about opportunities from that<br>perspective and you see this being you<br>know taken advantage of already in place<br>where there have been reductions or<br>elimination of restrictions florida<br>texas um obviously scandinavia these<br>places are you know they've dropped<br>restrictions or they you know even a<br>long time ago they've dropped them and<br>you can see just from the demographic<br>movements in the united states that that<br>that does lead to um more economic<br>prosperity you know the californians are<br>moving to texas why because it's better<br>for business and it's better for life<br>there so if australia and new zealand<br>really want to be on the front foot and<br>capture what remains of the good will<br>for<br>global trade and<br>you know movement of goods and services<br>and growth and and human welfare then<br>that's what they should do that is the<br>opportunity um so use this as a as a<br>reason if you need one politically<br>because that's been the problem for more<br>than a year now is politically it's been<br>impossible to extract uh you know the<br>story from covid and place focus on<br>something else but use the ukraine<br>situation or something with china or<br>whatever as a reason to reject all of<br>this this madness on kovid and refocus<br>on what is actually good for new zealand<br>and and that doesn't just mean<br>limiting numbers of people who died from<br>covert uh so i think that's the that's<br>the opportunity and i do think that we<br>are going to see a continued long tail<br>of the cold shower effect from the the<br>kind of inward turning um as i think<br>when they put it but we can try to push<br>against that and we should<br>and and globalization seems to be in<br>retreat currently um but do<br>panel members and persona bring in tim<br>and rodney do you see that as transitory<br>or are we seeing a fundamental shift now<br>in<br>great power politics which you know<br>really new zealand rides along on the<br>way we don't get to influence that a lot<br>um we we have to sort of cope with<br>whatever happens uh<br>what do you how do you read it tim<br>well first of all going back to the<br>ukraine i mean we're all familiar with<br>the law of unintended consequences<br>and if any<br>situation merits application of that<br>principle it is war<br>so i think as<br>i thought helen clark's comments<br>yesterday were absolutely on the money<br>the russians are probing<br>the boundaries uh of the western powers<br>and<br>what will actually happen is extremely<br>difficult to forecast with even slight<br>confidence i suppose if presta i would<br>say the most likely end game is the<br>installation of a puppet regime in kiev<br>but it won't stop there<br>and the consequences for putin himself<br>in the long term could be disastrous we<br>just don't know where this is going to<br>go<br>going back to the broader framework i<br>mean globalization is i mean putting<br>aside<br>covet my mind i don't want to elaborate<br>on this because i'm this is not my field<br>but my own view is that we're at the<br>beginning of the next<br>phase in management of covet which will<br>involve in fact dismantling of all these<br>restrictions um it's just that this<br>needs to unfold over time it's already<br>started in denmark another place like<br>that it will happen in australia and new<br>zealand which is it's the we're just six<br>months too early on this point so we'll<br>get back to um living with covet uh and<br>then we confront the central problem<br>you've raised stephen which is is<br>globalization i mean globalization being<br>smashed by covert but when that is then<br>just part of the background noise as it<br>will be in my view where do we go<br>well the first thing it goes back to my<br>point about american power<br>uh<br>the globalization period since 1945 as i<br>have argued like as a very conventional<br>view<br>rested on massive relative power<br>and what we've seen is the rise of an<br>alternative power center mainly china<br>that does not accept many of the<br>underlying norms<br>well i thought they did<br>but uh the situation has changed<br>dramatically i you mentioned rodney wong<br>i<br>i still remember um<br>going up to beijing to have discussions<br>with wangy when he was minister of<br>crosstraits relations to clear the lines<br>for me to begin a negotiation of a<br>comprehensive fta with taiwan<br>using of course the chinese taipei title<br>and that went very smoothly we were able<br>to do it our egg trade with taiwan has<br>gone through the roof as a consequence<br>of but that window that was a high we<br>took advantage as a small western<br>country of the high point of<br>globalization no question about this<br>situation since then has gone backwards<br>question is<br>is it perpetually in retreat and the<br>answer that can only be<br>well don't you know the old phrase<br>predictions of my death have been<br>greatly exaggerated don't fall into the<br>trap of predicting the end of<br>globalization because there are massive<br>technological and economic forces to<br>hold many of the achievements in place<br>and if we look into my area of<br>specialization trade policy that is<br>absolutely the case so after the<br>disastrous decision of the united states<br>trump i was sitting on the floor of<br>congress when he announced it and it was<br>an astonishing uh site to see these u.s<br>politicians respond to him with complete<br>stunned silence<br>but<br>japan canada australia new zealand and<br>the other members have kept that show on<br>the road<br>uh united kingdom which is the sixth<br>largest economy in the world<br>uh we'll end up joining that of that i<br>have zero doubt um korea will be next in<br>so<br>with respect to the wto that's more<br>problematic and far more important than<br>cptpp because it controls roughly 60 to<br>70 percent of global commerce<br>we are now testing the limits of what<br>used to be called the bicycle theory of<br>international trade which posited that<br>protectionism is a little bit like a<br>bicycle or either moves forward or it<br>slips backwards<br>but actually the analogy is wrong<br>because there are many trick cyclists<br>who can keep this thing wobbling in a<br>stationary position for some time and<br>that is essentially what is happening in<br>geneva it's done nothing in the last 20<br>years but it has not gone<br>remarkably backwards except with respect<br>to the united states withdrawal from the<br>dispute settlement process<br>so i am i think we should be overly<br>dramatic about this i have no doubt<br>we've seen the high point at least in my<br>professional life of globalization<br>but it's not going to suddenly all fall<br>away because there are very powerful<br>technological economic and political<br>forces trying to hold on to what it has<br>achieved<br>okay rodney your view<br>um<br>so<br>xi jinping uses this line you know the<br>the east is rising the west has then<br>declined<br>but<br>as tim says that underestimates the<br>resilience<br>so<br>yes we're past i i i like that framing<br>we're past the high point i mean<br>rather than saying it's the end of<br>globalization<br>that can globalization survive china<br>tuning inwards<br>and then russia but you know russia is<br>less important<br>economically than geopolitically it's<br>china that matters economically<br>and so china turned can globalization<br>still survive<br>china turning inward and it's going to<br>be tested um<br>global imbalances are going to worsen as<br>the private sector struggles in china<br>we're seeing exports rise and china's<br>kind of structural imbalances large<br>surpluses come back so we've got big<br>tests ahead of us particularly<br>you know what happens to chinese growth<br>this year and next year what happens<br>with zero covert china's run a good<br>surplus and a services deficit now their<br>services deficit has shrunk as they<br>don't travel for education for holidays<br>um<br>it's impossible to go there to sell your<br>services<br>so<br>we can get back to somewhere but for now<br>in 2022 and in 2023 the choices that xi<br>jinping makes what happens in china<br>is in some ways more important than<br>than anywhere else<br>and<br>so you know the long term is always<br>difficult i prefer to focus on the short<br>term and what we see right now is that<br>china's turning inwards turning away<br>from globalization<br>it's not over and the question then is<br>you know what happens in ukraine<br>is important what happens to russia<br>and then also what happens with china's<br>zero covert policy does the economic<br>costs the social cost of that become too<br>high<br>so<br>um i used to say that i i was a<br>short-term pessimist on<br>on china and long-term optimists are<br>much less optimistic long-term but<br>that's condition on xi jinping staying<br>on this track if we can see a change<br>then<br>better things can happen so gigi taking<br>your point about new zealand and<br>australia getting getting back to their<br>competitive advantages of course what's<br>been going on is that through this<br>period<br>commodity trade has really kept both<br>countries on their feet<br>and particularly<br>particularly you know australia iron ore<br>but but also to china right it's china<br>that's underpinning in a funny way i<br>remember as a minister<br>five years ago being told we were way<br>too dependent on china and way too<br>dependent on dairy well hello today<br>we're a lot more dependent on china and<br>a lot more dependent on dairy<br>so from your perspective geopolitically<br>and australia's have many more run-ins<br>with china than we have<br>diplomatically in the last last year or<br>two do you see<br>the bigger risk being the china<br>relationship<br>or the risk that china actually gets it<br>wrong as they as they centralize control<br>more under president xi the potential<br>for<br>things to get mucked up must be must be<br>getting higher<br>sure so i mean you're of course very<br>very right that china is extremely<br>important to australia economically and<br>that was also reflected in the other<br>panel's comments um<br>um but i i do think that it comes down<br>to uh whether or not it's actually<br>sustainable for china to cut off<br>their one of their best sources of<br>natural resources if they in fact decide<br>as the party okay we want to build more<br>here or build more there right i mean<br>iron is required for steel which is<br>required for construction right that's<br>that's sort of how it goes and same<br>thing for other kinds of natural<br>resources so first of all you wonder<br>about what's the level of production<br>going to be of those uh downstream<br>products around the world but<br>particularly in china which will then<br>require us to you know acquire natural<br>resources from some place australia will<br>continue to have a comparative advantage<br>in supplying this now there is some<br>activity in africa now that may compete<br>with some of our natural resources and<br>that's the sort of thing that you know<br>we should worry about but then there's<br>other exploration here you know rare<br>earth metals and whatnot so<br>um you know i think it was what tim was<br>saying about the powerful economic<br>forces right there are just very<br>powerful forces in play which come down<br>to the distribution of resources across<br>countries and the actual economic<br>self-interest of those countries um and<br>you know i am i am<br>more more of the mind that you know<br>australia will continue to have those<br>natural resources and we'll need to find<br>other ways to trade with other countries<br>including there but also in services if<br>we don't have chinese students we'll<br>have indian students if we don't sell<br>our iron to china we'll try to sell it<br>someplace else and<br>or we'll you know build something here<br>so economics has a way of working out um<br>the opportunities and exploiting the<br>opportunities when you allow people to<br>make decisions freely and go where they<br>want to go and<br>and trade where they want to trade so um<br>again that restriction of of covid and<br>the restrictions that are put in place<br>by uh any centralized regime really what<br>the government is saying here's what you<br>should do here's what you shouldn't do<br>including in china um that is a huge<br>drag on uh on discovery of new<br>opportunities that could replace some of<br>the ones that have been damaged during<br>this time or where we feel there's less<br>less certainty about the uh the demand<br>going forward for our products and our<br>services so um i am<br>cautiously optimistic but i agree very<br>much that there's going to be less<br>um less of a rosy future in terms of<br>growth and we've known that since you<br>know the start of our covert response we<br>have uh significantly damaged the<br>trajectory that we otherwise would have<br>been on in terms of gdp per capita and<br>that of course rests very much on our<br>trade uh overseas so we you know we've<br>sort of already damaged ourselves now<br>and now we're trying to recuperate and<br>uh and looking at a much less uh rosy<br>future that's for sure but there's<br>definitely things australia you can do<br>and should do and the same with new<br>zealand right now that would be in the<br>interest of the countries without doubt<br>and so politically i think it's quite<br>easy to put together a package and and<br>sell it and<br>uh you know just avoid the more damaging<br>directions that some other countries<br>have going are going because because the<br>world has<br>i suppose subsumed economics and a whole<br>range of other things for good or for<br>bad over the last 20 years so<br>we are sorry for the last 20 30 years<br>the world has been all about trying to<br>make uh their people more prosperous to<br>do things collectively as a group to try<br>and boost trade and increase prosperity<br>and and then in the last two years or<br>three years probably uh you know you've<br>hitting pretty hard and some of its<br>sectors sort of irrespective of the<br>economic impact<br>you've had the covert uh which we've<br>talked about and and and that's putting<br>you know for lots of people can can say<br>it's the right thing to do to put the<br>health response ahead of the economic<br>response but nevertheless it's been done<br>and now you have a situation in in<br>russia where uh there's no doubt that<br>the economic price that eastern europe<br>and russia in particular is going to pay<br>for that for this you know<br>incursion into ukraine is going to be<br>pretty high you sort of wonder at what<br>point does the world wake up and say<br>well actually we've got to actually make<br>our people more prosperous<br>uh and that has to become front and<br>center again tim do you think that's the<br>sort of<br>calculus that we've got to start<br>i don't think i can give you a snappy<br>one-line answer to that um<br>one thing's going through my mind is<br>what impact<br>the<br>the russian breaking of all the most<br>fundamental rules of stability in europe<br>will have on american politicians and<br>their thinking<br>and it's just possible that this could<br>be a giant wake-up call into washington<br>and that in itself can become a positive<br>matter<br>i just don't know it's just<br>there are too many uncertainties around<br>this uh new game uh uncertainties around<br>how far is president xi um going to take<br>china in this direction i<br>listening to rodney i just keep on<br>coming back to that wonderful analysis<br>of professor nicholas lardy the um<br>i think one of the great analysts of the<br>chinese economy petersen institute<br>who points out that<br>the state-owned sector of china<br>is the greatest drag on the chinese<br>economy the total factor productivity of<br>the soes is appalling compared with the<br>chinese private sector so if he<br>continues to move in this direction<br>taking<br>nicholas's title of his book the state<br>strikes back in this direction it's<br>going to<br>increase his problems and china's<br>problems and in the long run the biggest<br>issue china faces is the demographic<br>change in chinese<br>data<br>the chinese population is likely to<br>shrink um<br>massively over the next 30 or 40 years<br>and i always remember a professor of<br>demographics pointing out to an audience<br>that i was a participant in the<br>demographic projections tend to be the<br>most reliable of all long-term<br>projections<br>so we'll wait and see how that plays out<br>in the meantime i do think there's a<br>very intriguing<br>political problem facing australia and<br>new zealand and<br>our other partners in the tpp or<br>tpp<br>exercise and that's the chinese<br>application<br>all of these trade agreements are not<br>just agreements about international<br>commerce they're also statements of<br>geopolitical alignment<br>and i find it really intriguing to think<br>how on earth are australian new zealand<br>going to react to this<br>you see in the early discussions i had<br>with a man that i know you rodney will<br>if you don't know and personally know<br>often wong chu wen<br>who is um excuse my appalling anglo<br>version of chinese pronunciation but<br>he's an old friend of mine<br>and i've known and worked with him for<br>about 15 years<br>and<br>he even consulted me along with this<br>team dur in washington on what on earth<br>they should do um in response to trump's<br>ludicrous trade war on them<br>so during the earlier discussions when i<br>was the administrator of the tpp<br>negotiations because new zealanders new<br>zealand's the country that established<br>the tpp exercise<br>the discussion with<br>um<br>one chun and the senior chinese economic<br>officials was<br>they didn't have a political clearance<br>to join but it's quite clear to me that<br>ministry of commerce wanted to join and<br>the really intriguing reason they wanted<br>to join was because they wanted the<br>disciplines on soes<br>they were well aware as nicholas that<br>the soes are the weakest part of the<br>chinese economy<br>and they wanted those disciplines to<br>reform the weakest part of their economy<br>because as they used to say to me the<br>impetus from wto reform has now run out<br>we need further external influence now<br>these people are still there i don't<br>know how this is going to play out<br>but politically for the united states of<br>war australia and new zealand and our<br>other partners<br>an interest by china in joining cptpp is<br>fundamentally a different political<br>challenge to when the united states was<br>involved in it<br>and i think this is going to be a real<br>political problem<br>okay<br>look we're running out of time as always<br>and we've always got so much more to<br>talk about um i do want to come back if<br>we can to the events of the last 24<br>hours and<br>and the impact of those and how they<br>might play out in the southern<br>hemisphere i mean we know that<br>it's not as immediate and large as it is<br>for<br>our relationship with china when things<br>happen there but nevertheless we're<br>seeing a pretty big tearing of the<br>fabric<br>of of geopolitics and and globalization<br>at the moment with russia's invasion of<br>ukraine an earlier panel talked about<br>increases in commodity prices and<br>protect potentially increases in<br>inflation as a result particularly oil<br>and gas obviously<br>what do you think<br>are the sort of short and are there any<br>longer term impacts of what's happening<br>now with russia and and and ukraine<br>perhaps rodney if i come to you first<br>uh and um and then just go quickly<br>around the panel to finish<br>yeah it adds a layer of disruption on<br>our already disrupted world as we see<br>with supply chains movement of goods the<br>frozen movement of services so it is a<br>real shock and it will add to inflation<br>um and particularly for europe<br>it's a classic supply shop board that<br>will diminish growth so we're going to<br>take time to work<br>through this what it means if there's<br>one glimmer of optimism<br>from this discussion today it's that<br>maybe putin has sped up the protest<br>process maybe the invasion doesn't go as<br>well as he hopes um<br>maybe<br>in the end there's a backlash within<br>russia and even within china that this<br>is the wrong track to go down and so<br>you know maybe where things can happen<br>faster and<br>in five years we find ourselves in a<br>better position than we would think<br>today<br>um so i think basically i agree with<br>the analysis that you know there's going<br>to be probably a an impact on<br>prices overseas and of course if<br>commodity prices go up that's uh good<br>for australia potentially um it depends<br>on what commodities we're speaking of<br>but you know we've been worried about<br>inflation anyway for a while now because<br>of the signals in the u.s and elsewhere<br>and so it's really just a question of<br>how long it takes to propagate through<br>the supply chains and come here uh and<br>we have had a lot of fiscal stimulus um<br>and i think new zealanders also have<br>that because of it and so that gives<br>sort of the capacity of prices to<br>actually rise um because people have the<br>spending capacity so i am a bit worried<br>about inflation going forward which<br>would have other effects on the housing<br>market but<br>just to see things in perspective um<br>you know the kinds of effects on uh<br>dampening effects on global trade that<br>we are seeing or may see because of this<br>incipient and now happening war<br>um are<br>really small in comparison to what we've<br>done to ourselves over the last two<br>years again just to keep it in<br>perspective um we have we have kicked a<br>massive own goal not just here in the<br>antiquities but overseas as well many<br>places and so to focus now on one<br>particular event um it's sort of like<br>saying gee the canadian truckers you<br>know stopped trade over the ambassador<br>bridge and isn't that horrible because<br>it's disrupting supply chains and<br>everything well that's exactly what we<br>did<br>that what the the politicians the<br>leaders of countries all around the<br>world did for<br>many months if not years during the<br>covert period so keep perspective on on<br>what's happening and also remember all<br>politics is local<br>you know australia and new zealand care<br>about what's going on in their backyard<br>and our political choices are going to<br>be<br>reflective of what's important to<br>australia and new zealand and you know<br>as much as it's sad and dismaying to see<br>this sort of tearing of the geopolitical<br>fabric as as rodney said um in russia<br>and ukraine<br>it's it's just not that relevant to the<br>guy on the street in australia and so<br>what's relevant to him is can he keep<br>his job can he feed his family can he<br>see his children thrive can you take a<br>vacation in bali et cetera and so the<br>the best move for the politicians again<br>is while things play out overseas as<br>they will uh and there may be some ups<br>and downs and commodity prices and and<br>general uh willingness to to<br>trade with other countries um you know<br>try to do the best that he or she can in<br>his own patch and that means again<br>lifting restrictions getting back to<br>normal as quickly as possible oh and by<br>the way people want some information<br>about that this is my new book a<br>reasonably new book about the coveted<br>period<br>um just have to give a plug it's<br>available on amazon and it does talk<br>about how there isn't a health economics<br>trade-off economics is about health<br>economics is about providing an<br>opportunity a platform for the creation<br>of human longevity and well-being and<br>and the policy response we've seen<br>during covet has not been good for<br>health<br>congratulations on being the panelist<br>across the two days who's been able to<br>get through the most naked plug of their<br>book well done indeed um and uh finally<br>tim last word for you just very briefly<br>uh<br>in terms of the impact on new zealand of<br>what's playing out at the other end of<br>the world<br>well the first question would be what<br>will be the direct trade impact<br>sanctions will be imposed but it's<br>important to remember that our total<br>exports to russia are a tiny 200 million<br>dollars that's about one percent of new<br>zealand total global<br>goods exports and in any event it is<br>highly unlikely in the past when<br>sanctions have been implemented for<br>political reasons almost always food has<br>been exempted so i think one kind of<br>move immediately to say that the front<br>of mind thing of the media will be you<br>know what will this cost if new zealand<br>joins in sanctions as we will join in<br>sanctions have no doubt about that um<br>will be absolutely minimal you wouldn't<br>even notice it<br>um the bigger impacts economically will<br>be through the subtle impacts on<br>the price of oils now i think this<br>morning reached 110 in the futures<br>markets<br>this will add further to u.s inflation<br>this will influence decisions by the fed<br>as to how quickly they want to move on<br>the federal funds rate and therefore<br>what the outlook for global inflation<br>will be so i think this sort of the<br>indirect economic impacts are going to<br>be vastly more important than any<br>immediate trading packs<br>but you know you need to have a separate<br>discussion try and put numbers around<br>that<br>but certainly far more important<br>the bigger issues for new zealand really<br>will be political and i think we've<br>covered those issues great thank you<br>very much to the three of you<br>tim groser former trade minister<br>rodney jones principal economist at<br>wigram capital advisors and gigi foster<br>professor of economics the university of<br>new south wales in sydney thank you all<br>three
