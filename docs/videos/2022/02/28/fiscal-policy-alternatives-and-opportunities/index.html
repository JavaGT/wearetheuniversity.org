you and<br>looking forward to another good<br>discussion<br>maureen and welcome everyone to today's<br>session this morning looking at fiscal<br>policy alternatives and opportunities<br>my name's les oxley i'm professor of<br>economics at new zealand's number one<br>business school the waikato management<br>school uh toro papa and uh it's<br>i think very opportune that the fiscal<br>policy session follows what has been a<br>very active monetary policy session<br>but also follows the<br>discussion coming from carolee mcleish<br>our opening session<br>and i'd like to stress that this<br>particular session is looking at<br>alternatives and opportunities for<br>fiscal policy moving forward<br>and<br>we heard last night from jim bulger<br>a bit of a call for something different<br>from us in terms of moving forward he'd<br>heard many of these things before and<br>was throwing out the<br>opportunity for us to produce something<br>new<br>but also i've just heard in passing<br>charles goodhart<br>talking about<br>an opportunity here for new zealand to<br>take the opportunity to increase taxes<br>so we have alternatives and<br>opportunities available to us<br>we've got a wonderful panel here to<br>help discuss and<br>put their cases in terms of alternatives<br>and opportunities i'm going to give a<br>very brief<br>introduction<br>um we have mark holmes<br>who's a professor of economics here at<br>the wecado management school<br>mark's<br>expertise is in macro policy<br>and also macro theory but also has done<br>a lot of work on<br>housing infrastructure and other tax<br>related issues<br>we have sir robert mcleod who is<br>chairperson of sanford keysight holdings<br>he's got a long history in terms of his<br>tax expertise so he knows what has been<br>done<br>and has a equally strong reputation in<br>terms of looking at issues related to<br>indigenous in particular maori issues<br>which i think<br>we haven't really touched on<br>apart from under the maori business<br>session that we had<br>and we have oliver hartwich who is from<br>the new zealand initiative<br>oliver has a a much more extensive track<br>record than we have seen necessarily in<br>the in new zealand coming from a<br>background working in sydney and<br>advising i noticed the house of lords<br>in the uk a very<br>interesting advisory role so without<br>further ado i'd like to call upon mark<br>holmes to um to to pitch his<br>five to seven minutes uh stall here and<br>tell us about some opportunities and<br>alternatives thank you mark<br>thank you les hello everybody um<br>i want to say a few things about fiscal<br>policy alternatives and opportunities um<br>clearly this is a<br>big topic and falling on from the<br>closing comments yesterday you know this<br>is one of those areas that could have<br>occupied an entire forum<br>um<br>within itself<br>um but i i want to uh<br>just broach<br>one or two issues related to the the way<br>forward that we might um<br>experience so<br>as we're aware<br>there's been a deterioration in<br>public finances not just new zealand but<br>elsewhere<br>and<br>we have a degree of um uncertainty over<br>the future course of covet so you know<br>we're aware of the potential for stop<br>stars<br>economies impact on business confidence<br>uh problematic international travel<br>so on and so forth<br>so from the point of view of<br>fiscal policy makers<br>we have issues in terms of the<br>volatility of revenue streams<br>challenges in terms of planning fiscal<br>expenditure in the context of<br>stabilization policy<br>and against that we have a background in<br>terms of issues that include an aging<br>population<br>and<br>concerns over<br>productivity growth<br>so<br>what i see the opportunity here is in<br>terms of um a reflection on<br>tax and spending policies you know what<br>once um<br>if you like a recovery is well underway<br>from the covid era and it seems that the<br>new zealand government will need to<br>start thinking about getting its fiscal<br>position<br>um in order but of course a premature<br>withdrawal of fiscal support or<br>increased taxes<br>could potentially<br>undermine the recovery so<br>what i'm<br>really going to touch upon is<br>you know what what might happen<br>post covid and<br>perhaps relating to um<br>an issue that was covered in the opening<br>presentation yesterday in terms of<br>prudent investment versus<br>um<br>prudent debt<br>um you know do we need to be very<br>careful about uh rolling things forward<br>in that respect or do we have a case for<br>bringing<br>public debt to income ratios<br>back down to where they were<br>previously<br>now if we look at the<br>data i mean i've just uh delved into the<br>oecd database um<br>before the talk and it it's clear that<br>uh<br>by the measures presented there if we<br>look at the budget deficit<br>as a percentage of um gdp new zealand<br>sits um<br>relatively okay compared to other<br>um oecd countries<br>uh that i've been<br>looking at of course as with other<br>countries there's been a deterioration<br>there but um<br>you know it's it seems to be in a<br>in such a<br>negative territory um over time and if<br>we look at um<br>debt to income which you know where debt<br>is um<br>you know in part based on the<br>accumulation of past deficits<br>we can see that um nz<br>public debt to gdp again<br>looks um<br>reasonably respectable compared to other<br>oecd members and the oecd<br>average okay sure there's been an<br>but<br>it seems to be<br>an issue that is not as high as some of<br>the scary values that we've observed for<br>other countries so perhaps things don't<br>look as uncomfortable<br>as compared to<br>elsewhere so a question is<br>whether new zealand should aim to<br>rapidly re-establish<br>pre-pandemic levels of debt<br>or perhaps even pre-global financial<br>crisis<br>levels of debt<br>which saw a lower still<br>debt to<br>income ratio now fiscal stabilization<br>measures<br>might still be<br>related to you know<br>pandemic issues over time we don't<br>really know how the situation is going<br>to unfold and as we're talking of course<br>we have an ongoing<br>major international crisis and you know<br>we're cautious that this may to impact<br>on future<br>fiscal planning<br>as well but i wanted to<br>think about another question that has<br>come up in terms of prudent long-term<br>infrastructure projects and<br>is there still the opportunity to<br>invest in those projects at what are<br>still<br>low<br>interest rates and i'm thinking of<br>health education transport<br>we still have our climate change<br>obligations of course<br>and<br>whether we still have an opportunity to<br>push forward on that in a sense if you<br>think about the um<br>times going into better times uh post<br>covid does that free up<br>um<br>an element of uh budgetary support that<br>can provide resources that can be<br>allocated elsewhere<br>now<br>when we think about the debt to income<br>ratio we might think about<br>sustainability of that we see the new<br>zealand debt to income ratio<br>increasing we've had much lower values<br>now increasing above<br>you know say 50 percent<br>of gdp<br>um is that a stable or<br>unstable trajectory<br>over time<br>so<br>commentators might think about the real<br>interest rate that's um<br>paid on debt and compare that to the<br>growth rate<br>of the<br>economy<br>okay so<br>comparison of if you like r and g real<br>interest rate growth rate of the economy<br>might provide a<br>um an approximate rule of thumb not a<br>strict one because um you know there are<br>many um<br>many bells and whistles many ifs and<br>buts in<br>drawing out the um<br>theory but it might suggest that a<br>higher debt to income ratio may still be<br>sustainable if the real interest rate is<br>relatively lower but of course we now<br>observe interest rates going up um<br>obviously we have developments this week<br>in new zealand u.s fed next month almost<br>certainly will<br>increase interest rates i think and so<br>is this becoming a missed opportunity<br>with rising rates<br>um<br>over time<br>so<br>we<br>it's my opinion worth you know thinking<br>about this as a potential issue if we<br>free up resources that can be<br>put into longer term<br>investment there are a number of<br>concerns okay so a fiscal expansion<br>could be in conflict with an inflation<br>targeting<br>central bank<br>there are consequences of high debt okay<br>we could be vulnerable in the future<br>financial crisis we have reduced<br>um<br>fiscal space<br>the economist recently published um<br>an estimated effect with not just public<br>but private debt as well 12 percent of<br>world gdp goes on interest costs<br>burdens in<br>on future generations perhaps<br>um though longer-term investments may be<br>to the benefit of future generations<br>um so we've got all these these types of<br>issues so if that remains where it is or<br>stays high<br>then um you know maybe we need to think<br>carefully about why we've gone into debt<br>um in the<br>um first place there<br>so when we<br>think about um<br>you know the way forward<br>we might say well<br>there's perhaps a need to improve<br>infrastructure but is new zealand<br>comfortable<br>with that are we better with<br>a lower debt to income ratio<br>um i think of the work by reinhardt and<br>rogoff published in 2010 which you know<br>brought suggested that countries with<br>debt to income ratios above 90 of<br>gdp<br>have a one percent lower<br>growth rate now there's a lot of<br>empirical scrutiny there a lot of uh<br>critiques of that<br>um but it's out there for<br>consideration and of course the prospect<br>that<br>if we go more into debt then that might<br>lead to an interest rate premium being<br>added to what new zealand tries to<br>borrow<br>um rounding things off and say well you<br>know let's think carefully about where<br>we want new zealand to be in terms of<br>national indebtedness in terms of where<br>the public debt<br>should be but perhaps there are<br>opportunities that we want to think<br>about that we can carefully<br>invest in if i look around new zealand<br>at the moment um<br>i'm inclined to ask with one or two<br>things going on is there a fundamental<br>problem in terms of new zealand getting<br>projects<br>completed you know i see projects out<br>there which<br>a huge value to the economy<br>transmission goalie that this is a you<br>know private public partnership joint<br>venture of course you know two years<br>overdue and no no guarantee will be<br>finished by the end of the year but<br>you know the obvious issues why that<br>hasn't really um<br>come about uh the auckland light rail<br>saga appears to um you know drag on for<br>quite a while<br>um<br>does lee want to wonder you know when<br>will this occur so you know<br>is there a fundamental problem<br>in new zealand in terms of you know<br>pushing ahead with projects that um are<br>you know desirable but<br>not really getting the act together to<br>put them into place and it seems this<br>has been an issue going on for<br>many years<br>okay i think i've<br>probably used my my time up there so i<br>will hand back to les<br>thank you for that mark um it seems to<br>be that um<br>the opportunities that you're looking at<br>here relate to um issues of investment<br>which again as you suggest<br>haven't really delivered even with lower<br>interest rates<br>so um for now we'll we'll hold that<br>conversation and i'll<br>ask for sir robert mccloud's views on<br>alternatives and opportunities<br>in this fiscal space so robert<br>well thank you liz<br>and uh good morning everybody it's a<br>pleasure to be here um as liz mentioned<br>my background in fiscal policy is is tax<br>and so i've done i'll focus uh<br>principally on that topic<br>but perhaps this is a segway to that to<br>that topic it's just worth reflecting<br>just on what shapes<br>tax policy and indeed the demand for<br>taxation in a<br>in the new zealand economy<br>um<br>one thing i like to<br>to remind people of is that um the<br>effective tax rate for the nation is<br>probably best thought of as as<br>government spending<br>as a percentage of gdp um<br>most people would uh you know not tend<br>to think of it that way but the point<br>that that metric makes is that<br>essentially<br>um any any um<br>deficit in<br>financing spending through taxation<br>ends up obviously in a fiscal deficit<br>and if we're the other way we get a<br>surplus so i i like the just to remind<br>ourselves that um the metric that's<br>important to keep a finger on or an eye<br>on is government spending to gdp and<br>and i think to me um spending being a<br>fiscal conservative spending is the<br>challenge<br>um<br>and<br>the government is resource constrained<br>as is everybody in new zealand let alone<br>the world and the the public sectors and<br>the private sector really compete for<br>resources so<br>if government spending gets out of<br>control gets too high um effectively<br>it's crowding out the private sector and<br>one in this debate on fiscal<br>management one has got to develop a<br>philosophy<br>about what is to be done by our<br>government and what is to be done by the<br>private sector<br>and conventionally um<br>most thinkers have taken the view that<br>the private sector is more productive<br>in producing our goods and services in<br>the government sector<br>but i think in modern times that that<br>old point tends to be<br>is tending to be<br>put on the back burner<br>and<br>cara lee's comments yesterday morning<br>for example about prudent investment<br>which is focusing on government's<br>investments um<br>is sort of taking us in the direction of<br>having more confidence in the quality of<br>government spending government investing<br>and and for me that's an empirical<br>matter as well as a theoretical one<br>it's largely an empirical one and you've<br>got to actually stand back not only in<br>new zealand<br>but in the world and ask whether the<br>quality<br>and our goods and services<br>and our investing actually comes from<br>public sector or comes from the private<br>sector<br>but anyway that i think shapes obviously<br>the way a government will think about<br>fiscal policy<br>because ultimately<br>taxation has got to finance the spending<br>and the spending is essentially as i say<br>a decision is between how much is done<br>by public and private sectors<br>one thing people may be interested to<br>know is that the new zealand tax system<br>is lauded by the oecd and is lauded by<br>most overseas commentators<br>it's it's held in high regard<br>and i think it deserves to be held in<br>that regard because of<br>the effort that past governments have<br>put into getting tax policy right<br>and that's that's as much about the way<br>policy is done as it is actually about<br>the policy<br>settings<br>and um<br>in 1994 sariba richardson<br>gave us the generic tax policy process<br>which puts a heavy emphasis on shaping<br>tax policies<br>on consulting with the public sector<br>effectively seeing tax policy as a joint<br>venture between government<br>and the private sector<br>in recent times and from time to time<br>all through the various government<br>regimes there's an inclination<br>sometimes for governments to<br>put that process aside<br>and for politicians to rush into<br>legislating tax policies<br>with minimal consultation<br>as a general observation<br>looking back on that empirically those<br>policy changes tend to be<br>criticized the most<br>or they tend to be the weakest and i<br>think it's it's imperative for us to<br>keep<br>lobbying our politicians to ensure that<br>they do in fact do the proper<br>consultation in policies that come<br>forward um and in the context of the<br>pandemic and in the context perhaps of<br>the seminar we're sort of thinking about<br>interventions to smooth business cycles<br>monetary policy i think is rightly seen<br>as the lead steer on doing that because<br>fiscal instruments are more medium to<br>longer term and they are more clunky and<br>lumpy<br>and tax policy for example is not<br>something<br>that you can necessarily<br>put into the system at short term to do<br>immediate and short run impacts<br>probably the closest you come to that<br>ability and tax policy is tax rate<br>setting but as far as tax base<br>determination is concerned that is not<br>something that delivers fiscal<br>consequences immediately<br>and also tax policy on the base design<br>is far more suited to long-run<br>thinking and long-run<br>settings<br>and you can observe that empirically let<br>alone theoretically<br>so take the last reform debate on the<br>calendar review about our capital gains<br>tax<br>matter um i think that demonstrates that<br>that's a tax reform that not only takes<br>time in terms of its shaping and<br>thinking on the government side but also<br>on getting it politically past the<br>electorate and getting the public by and<br>that those sorts of massive tax reforms<br>involved<br>in the new zealand system we have<br>gst and income tax as our substantial<br>tax-based sources<br>and it's hard to imagine that those two<br>tax bases leave gaps in<br>covering the gdp<br>and indeed in the mcleod review which i<br>chaired some years ago now in 2001<br>when we proceeded very closely on<br>examining where gaps in the tax base<br>were and we had kind of evaluated the<br>prospect or the attractiveness of taxes<br>by reference to the gaps that they might<br>plug or the gaps that they may fill<br>and the general view at that time was<br>that there weren't that many there were<br>some but there weren't that many<br>material<br>uh tax gaps now i for one am not<br>a strong advocate for miracle countries<br>putting in myriad taxes and tax types in<br>their tax base<br>the the duality the duopoly of gst and<br>income tax<br>fantastic mass tax bases that work in<br>partnership to give us the broad<br>coverage that we need and it's given<br>rise to the mantra<br>of the broad base and the low rate<br>which is very again i think very hard to<br>beat<br>as a practical concept that delivers<br>revenue results and stable results<br>and tax cyclical terms to a government<br>so<br>i think really the burden of proof is on<br>anybody advocating<br>supplements to those taxpayers<br>indeed to the extent that government<br>once more tax<br>they've got the right<br>opportunity in respect of those bases<br>and there has been ongoing debate about<br>whether the gst at 15 is high enough or<br>indeed 39 top marginals on the income<br>tax base at the personal level is high<br>enough<br>28 for the corporate base<br>um and those arguments go in both<br>directions<br>but i i think that we need to preserve<br>the assets that we've got in our tax<br>policy and the broad-based low-rate<br>mantra i think is part of that<br>um<br>i was just going to sort of touch on the<br>fact also that revenue taxes are there<br>to raise the revenue to finance the<br>government spending it's important to<br>realize that the taxes as incentives or<br>taxes as instruments to modify behaviour<br>really belong to a different category of<br>taxation thinking<br>the tax taxes that we live with in new<br>zealand most people think about our<br>revenue taxes<br>and the design of those taxes is the<br>exact opposite<br>of the design of<br>uh corrective taxation or behavioural<br>taxation<br>revenue taxes are actually designed not<br>to alter behave<br>because if they do alter behavior the<br>deadweight losses associated with them<br>go up<br>and it's really the province of the<br>corrective or the pagovian tax<br>you know that narrowly focuses on<br>correction of behaviour or addressing<br>market failure and i would argue also in<br>the context of a pandemic or fiscal<br>pressures<br>that that dichotomy between revenue and<br>corrective taxes is important to<br>maintain and not conflate<br>people shouldn't think<br>really about revenue tax design as an<br>instrument to modify behaviour<br>i'll just conclude my remarks on<br>inflation i'm very really pleased that<br>the commentators to a person all<br>recognize that inflation is one of the<br>most evil things that can inflict be<br>inflicted on an economy and in the tax<br>system it is also evil<br>in the sense that can lead to over<br>taxation when you've got negative real<br>interest rates and we're still taxing<br>nominal interest<br>people are being over taxed in terms of<br>economic income<br>and the same goes for other categories<br>of set on the flip side liabilities get<br>a tax break in inflationary times<br>and obviously fiscal drag which is<br>people being taxpayers being pushed<br>higher into higher tax brackets<br>is great for government but actually<br>also bad for the private sector and bad<br>for tax rates<br>in general and it's important to ensure<br>that governments don't become addicted<br>to inflation because<br>inflation can give it more tax revenue<br>and can also depreciate<br>its debt obligations one way of actually<br>paying off<br>uh government debt in the future really<br>is to inflate it away so<br>there are<br>addictive features of inflation that our<br>fiscal masters need to basically ensure<br>that they don't become addicted to<br>so hopefully those are a few comments<br>and foods for thought that um that are<br>useful and<br>i'll pass over back to you<br>liz and and to oliver<br>uh thank you sir robert again some<br>useful reminders of the fact that we<br>have revenue raising and pigouvian type<br>taxes but we move straight on now to to<br>oliver<br>thank you less and uh good morning<br>everyone when in fact it's not a good<br>morning it is a completely different<br>world<br>from the one we had until last week ago<br>the world in which we woke up this<br>morning<br>and i find it difficult actually to talk<br>about fiscal policy on a day where<br>russian tanks are rolling towards kiev<br>and when the global order the order of<br>post 1989 is really now coming to an end<br>in front of our eyes<br>makes it really hard to talk about<br>fiscal policy but maybe that makes it<br>all the more important to talk about<br>fiscal policy in the world we are facing<br>if i look a little bit tired that's<br>probably because i spent most of last<br>night glued to the television watching<br>everything from cnn to bbc to a lot of<br>german channels just trying to figure<br>out what is happening<br>because i think what we're seeing really<br>is<br>a completely different world emerging<br>with a lot of threats and risks and<br>uncertainty<br>and that makes it even more difficult of<br>course than to talk about alternatives<br>and opportunities for fiscal policy here<br>but i think we have to we have to talk<br>about all of this we have to talk<br>about these global affairs about these<br>global risks<br>i don't think you think we'd do that<br>enough in new zealand i mean the<br>dominion post today at least had the<br>conflict on the front page<br>but you had to go to page 19 to find any<br>more reports on it and i find that<br>dangerous for us in new zealand because<br>i think these global affairs<br>they matter they will impact us here<br>they will have an effect on fiscal<br>policy and all sorts of other policies<br>as well<br>and when we talk about geopolitics of<br>course russia is not the only threat<br>that we see<br>we could equally talk about china and<br>china's ambitions not least in south<br>china sea<br>we should probably still talk about<br>north korea we should keep an eye on<br>iran there is no lack of geopolitical<br>risks today and it's not just<br>geopolitical risks of course we have big<br>economic risks<br>fiscal risks big<br>monetary risks as well<br>we see the rise of inflation worldwide<br>and i think for some regions that's<br>probably a challenge even bigger than<br>the challenge it is to us<br>i think of europe i think of the euro<br>crisis which never really finished which<br>has always been kept under reps but i<br>think which is coming back now<br>with the rise of inflation in europe<br>because the european central bank will<br>find it really difficult<br>to balance the needs of some of the eu's<br>member states with the need to fight<br>inflation and bring europe back to price<br>stability<br>we could talk about the potential of a<br>global financial crisis and actually my<br>colleague boss wilkinson just published<br>a report on that<br>late last year where we basically came<br>to the conclusion<br>it's probably a matter of when and not<br>if we have a global financial crisis 2.0<br>and then of course oil and energy prices<br>again<br>linked of course to the geopolitical<br>events we're just witnessing now um we<br>have seen the oil price rise above 100<br>um just in the last 24 hours it's<br>probably not the end of the story so<br>there are plenty of risks threats<br>uncertainty<br>and i said that makes it really<br>difficult to talk about fiscal policy<br>alternatives and opportunities<br>the question i have for new zealand is<br>are we prepared are we prepared for any<br>of these developments that we can see<br>overseas<br>and when i say are we prepared i mean<br>not just as an economy<br>dealing with it but are we prepared with<br>our institutions are our institutions<br>prepared and more specifically<br>our economic institutions prepared the<br>government's institutions that actually<br>guide us through fiscal policy economic<br>policy and monetary policy<br>and on that one<br>i have gravedouts and i just want to<br>explain that with a little example which<br>i find telling it is just this tiny<br>little example but it tells you the<br>problem in a nutshell<br>there was a job advertisement from<br>treasury just a couple of weeks ago and<br>treasury which styles itself as the<br>government's key economic advisory<br>agency was looking for a senior analyst<br>for its economic strategy team<br>now this is what treasury wrote into the<br>job at<br>it specified that<br>an economics background is not essential<br>and instead treasury told us about the<br>successful candidates the following<br>they were looking for someone with good<br>critical thinking skills through<br>constructive debate but people in<br>relationship skills comfort working at<br>pace and dealing with ambiguity probably<br>quite important these days<br>they were looking for a superb<br>communicator with eq the ability to<br>motivate and influence others<br>an interest in mentoring and supporting<br>other team members<br>the<br>job advertisement and really this was<br>all about the candidate was so bland and<br>so general really anyone could have<br>applied probably even my nine-year-old<br>son<br>if treasury has given up on even asking<br>for economic expertise we shouldn't be<br>surprised that we won't get it anymore<br>and this is a development that has<br>worried me since i arrived in new<br>zealand i've been here for 10 years now<br>and one of my very first meetings<br>actually was a joint workshop organized<br>by treasury and vic where they were<br>trying to develop the first bits of the<br>living standards framework frankly i've<br>been following this now for 10 years i<br>still do not know what a living<br>standards framework is supposed to<br>achieve that a proper cost benefit<br>analysis couldn't and actually i think<br>it is worse i think the living standards<br>framework is distracting us from what a<br>proper cost benefiting elizabeth would<br>actually tell us<br>it makes it very difficult to balance<br>different competing objectives it<br>actually prevents the kind of economic<br>rigor that we would expect from a<br>treasury<br>that we're no longer getting<br>i think this living standards framework<br>is leading us astray it is a pentagram<br>it doesn't really add any value and it<br>distracts<br>and when i listened to the treasury<br>secretary speech yesterday we saw some<br>examples of that she of course went on<br>about the living sentence framework how<br>important it was in the development of<br>well-being policies well<br>actually what i would like to see is<br>some economic rigor we're not getting it<br>because treasury for a long time has<br>actually neglected appointing properly<br>qualified economists<br>not saying that that's the case for all<br>of treasury there are pockets of<br>excellence within treasury we look at<br>the housing team within treasury they're<br>doing a really good job<br>but overall i think the quality of<br>advice coming out of treasury has<br>diminished<br>i also founded telling yesterday that in<br>the treasury secretary speech we didn't<br>hear anything about global risks it was<br>left to the question and answer session<br>and someone asked about that and then<br>she gave us a statement but it actually<br>didn't feature she talked a lot about<br>fiscal forecasts but all the big risks<br>the kind of risks i mentioned earlier<br>didn't even feature<br>and i think the worst bit of it was<br>actually then when she talked about<br>climate change policy and the ets<br>she asserted without giving us any<br>evidence that we needed policies beyond<br>the ets when in fact the ets actually<br>covers our emissions now we have a<br>binding cap in the emissions trading<br>scheme and a lot of the policies that<br>you try to introduce on top of it<br>actually are completely superfluous they<br>don't have an effect on the total amount<br>of emissions all they do is they distort<br>carbon prices when actually we need<br>carbon prices to guide our investment in<br>the future<br>so i think that particular economic<br>institution in our<br>government<br>scene doesn't really help us it is not<br>providing the kind of advice that would<br>even allow us to identify opportunities<br>and alternatives and sadly the same<br>could be said for the other big<br>institutions in the country i think the<br>rbnz has come under a lot of flag<br>recently for its management and i must<br>say i have lost count of the number of<br>deputy and associate governors of the<br>army and said no employees and again we<br>have a qualifications problem recently<br>the rbnz appointed a<br>governor or an associate governor<br>with responsibility for macroeconomic<br>policy but that person didn't have any<br>economic spectrum whatsoever<br>or look at the monetary policy committee<br>actually the economics background would<br>be a hindrance now being appointed to<br>the monetary policy committee because<br>they have actually specified that if you<br>have any previous research in<br>macroeconomic policy monetary policy or<br>any research interest for future<br>research you do not qualify because they<br>see see it as a potential conflict of<br>interest well by that standard he<br>basically couldn't employ anyone<br>currently serving on the monetary policy<br>committees or boards of governors of the<br>big central banks in the world i find it<br>ludicrous and again the treasury<br>secretary was asked in the q a session<br>about that yesterday when the treasury<br>provided any advice on that and<br>basically dug that question<br>and finally where we previously got some<br>decent advice<br>on economic policy apart from treasury<br>the productivity commission i read the<br>latest speeches from the chair of the<br>productivity commission almost<br>apologizing for the task of this<br>organization namely to lift our<br>productivity our actual economic output<br>standards and make new zealand a much<br>better more highly productive economy i<br>sometimes read the speeches coming out<br>of the protcom as an apology for the<br>task for which it was initially<br>instituted<br>so<br>really going back to the theme of this<br>conversation<br>fiscal policy alternatives opportunities<br>i actually see a lot more risks and<br>threats and uncertainty arising from<br>international economic circumstances<br>monetary circumstances<br>the state of the banking system globally<br>but also of course and especially on a<br>day like today from the geopolitics<br>there are too many risks hanging above<br>us risks that we in new zealand of<br>course cannot even<br>properly influence but we should be<br>prepared for them we should actually<br>take this as our challenge now to make<br>sure that new zealand can weather the<br>storms which will come our way i think<br>it is not a question of whether we will<br>get a new global financial crisis of<br>whether we will face<br>problems in international energy markets<br>it is a<br>question of just when this will occur<br>and how bad it will be<br>i wish new zealand to be prepared for<br>that but in order to prepare for this<br>properly we need all our economic<br>advisory agencies all our core<br>institutions of government in this field<br>to be prepared for this to have the<br>intellectual firepower to have the level<br>of information necessary to really<br>confront these challenges because<br>otherwise i think we will not be<br>prepared and we will head for very very<br>dangerous and difficult times in new<br>zealand thank you<br>thank you oliver and i i<br>second the<br>issues in relation to the ukraine and<br>also to global risk<br>um we're sort of running quite quickly<br>out of time here i could briefly<br>summarize where i think we're at<br>mark holmes was<br>giving<br>opportunities in terms of a longer-term<br>investment with relatively low interest<br>rates so robert was i think um giving us<br>a very clear picture that he believes<br>that the<br>the the the the tax base the tax system<br>is is well placed in new zealand and<br>well respected<br>and oliver<br>um reiterates some of the issues that<br>sharon zolner was talking about in terms<br>of risk<br>um sharon made it clear that we can't<br>reduce risk totally risk will be<br>everywhere but whether we are actually<br>aware and prepared for global risk again<br>oliver talked in relation to<br>an issue that has been coming through a<br>number of the the questions here in<br>relation to whether our institutions are<br>sufficiently well placed to be able to<br>deal with what are a series of quite<br>unique problems for new zealand the<br>issue of a growing deficit<br>and one where we're facing global risks<br>and i have questioned here with several<br>questions from<br>those<br>tuning in<br>relating to how fast<br>we should be thinking about closing this<br>deficit and also the relationship<br>between<br>the monetary um<br>uh system<br>and the fiscal system where in the past<br>fiscal policy has always been playing<br>really the back room role<br>um and as robert suggests<br>um this is a medium and longer term role<br>uh monetary policy through the reserve<br>bank had a tradition of being very<br>transparent that transparency seems to<br>be<br>a little more opaque<br>there seems to be more uncertainty and<br>the question i ask all of you for the a<br>quick reply here is the extent to which<br>moving forward we need treasury and the<br>reserve bank to make it plain to<br>everyone what their plans are for the<br>future<br>many of<br>our people have never lived through<br>inflation they have never lived through<br>the consequences of inflation<br>and for me trying to teach inflation to<br>18 and 19 year olds over the last 10<br>years you know basically that's when the<br>laptops open and the cell phones open<br>because they don't know what i'm talking<br>about<br>so are we prepared as<br>as a nation our institutions<br>sufficiently robust<br>well qualified and powerful enough to<br>deal with this crisis<br>post<br>covert um<br>so rob do you want to answer that ques<br>uh put a view here<br>sure thanks<br>um<br>look the um<br>the the question starts with the fiscal<br>deficits and how and the speed with<br>which we should remove them um<br>one thing to go back to perhaps by way<br>of example i'm going all the way back to<br>the molding administration which was<br>possibly the peak of where our fiscal<br>books were in the worst state of<br>disorder and the switch of government<br>through to the longi labor government<br>and<br>that took a long long time to work<br>through the system but asset sales for<br>example were a big component of it<br>essentially you know that fiscal<br>accounting and management really has the<br>the<br>capital streams of<br>of capital spending and capital receipts<br>by the government<br>um but also has the tax component and<br>and what i would call the revenue<br>receipts and economics economic national<br>income accounting that capital revenue<br>distinction is not emphasized<br>but as a practical matter it needs to be<br>emphasized but ultimately<br>the government needs a plan in my<br>opinion it needs a plan on fiscal<br>management in terms of deficit<br>management which is medium term<br>it's not sensible<br>um to actually make<br>precarious and abrupt changes in tax<br>design in my opinion<br>to actually<br>try and get rid of deficits in the short<br>run<br>and and the most important lever for the<br>government and medium term fiscal<br>management is spending<br>the<br>spending comes first and financing of<br>that spending comes second<br>it's not the other way around you don't<br>um<br>you don't try and you know spruce up a<br>tax system that can suck out<br>as much revenue as possible from the<br>economy and then actually have a spend<br>up in the in the in the next phase of<br>that<br>um i think australia provides an<br>interesting example for example<br>australia<br>total total government spending and<br>total taxes all governments it has been<br>about five percentage points below the<br>new zealand statistic<br>and i've often wondered why that is and<br>having spent seven or so years there um<br>in the last decade i came to realise<br>that actually their tax system has got<br>so much bad design in it particularly<br>the gst<br>that it's actually starved off the<br>government from from from revenue<br>and that starvation of revenue has<br>caused the spending by that government<br>to actually<br>um to be less than would otherwise be<br>and<br>i i've never actually been an advocate<br>for designing bad tax policy to in fact<br>strangle government spending although<br>i've been tempted to from time to time<br>to advocate that position<br>but australia is a living example of<br>that happening<br>um<br>but anyway hopefully those remarks are<br>of interest i'll pass over to my<br>colleagues i i've been given a wrap<br>here so um does anyone want to take the<br>mark i think you're on<br>your mute<br>mark<br>yeah i'll just briefly um<br>say something on the speed of<br>removal<br>uh reducing the um<br>the deficit and of course the you know<br>the these geopolitical events um<br>can be crucial and i think economies can<br>be more vulnerable in a crisis with high<br>debt than low debt and um depending on<br>the perceived magnitude and length of<br>the crisis and how it's going to impact<br>new zealand<br>then of course that yes that would<br>constitute the case for<br>um definitely bringing debt to income<br>down<br>for the economy<br>um<br>and so the economy can be a better place<br>when if the crisis hits um<br>fully but i i still you know still<br>believe in prudent investment is a way<br>forward as and when the time would be<br>right<br>oliver i fully agree with everything<br>that mark just said and i would add to<br>that of course new zealand has a<br>specific challenge to deal with as well<br>we know that this country every few<br>years gets a natural disaster to deal<br>with whether it's a volcanic eruption or<br>an earthquake or tsunami<br>we have to be ready for these events<br>because they are a feature of our<br>geography and geology<br>and therefore i think it is only prudent<br>to reduce that levels to a level<br>that would allow us in the future to<br>deal with them when they occur again<br>because again they will occur at some<br>stage we just have to be ready for them<br>well i'd like to to wrap up here by<br>thanking all of you mark<br>sir robert and oliver for<br>some very insightful observations and<br>comments moving forward<br>and now i think that we're going to have<br>a short break<br>this discussion could go on for much<br>longer<br>but we have to to move on so thank you<br>very much from<br>everyone here at the economics forum<br>and um yes please keep thinking and<br>posting about these ideas</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
