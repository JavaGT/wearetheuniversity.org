was great<br>to have you here in person<br>uh last year adrian at your old<br>university uh no doubt brought back some<br>memories and uh<br>hopefully next year back in person again<br>uh but in the meantime looking forward<br>to your talk today i'm sure it will be<br>keenly watched given other statements<br>earlier in the week we'll hand over to<br>you for those watching online please do<br>get questions through on slido i'll<br>receive those here in the studio and<br>after adrian's speech we'll have the<br>chance to put some questions to him<br>adrian over to you<br>um<br>and thank you uh matt thank you wakato<br>university um for this opportunity<br>and welcome everyone um uh and i look<br>forward to your questions so uh today<br>i've actually we've uh putting a speech<br>out on the record so the good news is<br>you can put your note notes down<br>you'll be able to read<br>what i've had to say<br>in the comfort of your own homes um and<br>yes i do look forward to being there in<br>person and i i strongly believe that<br>will be the case for this time next year<br>so um central banks around the world are<br>currently confronted with a<br>a significant challenge it's a challenge<br>we haven't seen for some time but it is<br>a challenge we're familiar with and that<br>is rising inflation pressures<br>the unfamiliar part really is the<br>environment within which we are tackling<br>this uh inflation challenge<br>these environments are always unique and<br>the world is always uncertain so this<br>morning i really just want to touch on<br>the context that we made our monetary<br>policy decisions in um particularly over<br>uh<br>this week<br>and also some of the challenges both the<br>ones we have faced and we face ahead and<br>particularly unique<br>aspects of these challenges for monetary<br>policy<br>so without doubt the covet 19 pandemic<br>provided<br>really a unique setting for many central<br>banks<br>we had to meet our low and stable<br>consumer price inflation goals<br>are really in the context of a unique<br>and emerging health economic shock<br>throughout<br>the world<br>in early 2020<br>there were some really challenging<br>factors facing policymakers economic<br>policymakers globally<br>the economic outlook and hence any<br>optimal policy response became very<br>dependent on the scale and the severity<br>of the covert 19 virus<br>this scale and severity in the meanwhile<br>became dependent on a host of factors<br>how individuals households governments<br>and central banks<br>would react to the pandemic environment<br>the pace at which a vaccine would be<br>developed and how effective that vaccine<br>would be and how quick it could actually<br>be rolled out internationally<br>and of course how the virus would evolve<br>over time<br>so we're still amongst this at the<br>moment but<br>they were very unique and uncertain<br>challenges for us<br>epidemiologists<br>throughout the world struggle to model<br>and predict the path of the virus<br>but these predictions played a<br>considerable role in how governments and<br>central banks developed any<br>appropriate economic policy response<br>from the outset of the shock um we made<br>it very clear here at the reserve bank<br>and through our monetary policy<br>committee that any search for economic<br>certainty was futile<br>and instead we needed to provide as much<br>monetary policy certainty<br>as possible within that uncertain<br>economic environment<br>this is why we adopted a leased regrets<br>framework for deciding on our actions<br>and we continue to do so today<br>and by this we mean ensuring that we<br>avoid the worst policy mistakes while<br>maximizing our ability to continue to<br>meet our objectives over the medium term<br>in early 2020<br>the risks to the global economy were<br>heavily skewed to the downside it was an<br>incredibly biased<br>outlook to the downside for inflation<br>and for<br>economic growth and employment<br>governments had<br>deliberately restricted economic and<br>social activity<br>so as to control as best as possible the<br>spread of the covet-19 virus<br>people also acted to protect their own<br>personal health and well-being first and<br>foremost<br>new zealand faced a very material threat<br>of experiencing a prolonged<br>period of below target consumer price<br>inflation and employment levels well<br>below any measure of uh maximum<br>sustainable levels<br>uh the situation that we most wanted to<br>avoid was one where inflation and<br>economic economic activity and<br>employment became persistently depressed<br>we were especially concerned about the<br>scarring impact on new zealand's<br>economic capability as business<br>investment<br>came to a halt<br>and to avoid<br>high unemployment and high unemployment<br>becoming persistent through time<br>so obviously our path of least regrets<br>was to move very quickly to ease<br>monetary conditions and to take other<br>steps to bolster what i would call cash<br>flow and competence throughout the<br>economy through this initial wave of<br>uncertainty<br>uh a unique challenge was of course that<br>we entered this period like many central<br>banks around the world with nominal<br>interest rates very near their effective<br>lower bound<br>by that i mean where the official cash<br>rate any further reductions in the<br>official cash rate become ineffective in<br>bringing forward spending activity<br>uh i mentioned this was the case<br>globally<br>and it followed after a very long period<br>of low and stable inflation and<br>declining global real interest rates<br>so i meant the committee like many other<br>peer central banks needed to supplement<br>our official cash rate policy tool with<br>additional forms of monetary policy<br>easing<br>our aim was to further lower long-term<br>interest rates below where what we could<br>achieve with the official cash rate<br>fortunately for us we had been preparing<br>for these types of um uh<br>situations prior to the covert 19<br>outbreak and so we were able to operate<br>and work<br>pretty quickly in the face of this shock<br>uh we responded to the cover 19 shock<br>initially by lowering the official cash<br>rate uh by 75 basis points so we took it<br>down to as<br>what we would consider it's then<br>effective lower bound and we implemented<br>additional monetary policy tools and<br>this included the large-scale asset<br>purchase program and the funding for<br>lending program<br>our monetary stimulus over time<br>was thankfully accompanied by<br>significant government spending and<br>investment fiscal support um<br>including transfer payments<br>and this was incredibly important given<br>some of the specific supply-side nature<br>of this economic shock<br>the government's response in the end<br>turned out to be one of the largest<br>with across the oecd across advanced<br>economies<br>and it was very welcomed again i should<br>say from the monetary policy committee<br>the combined health and economic policy<br>response of new zealand has to do to<br>date<br>been ranked as one of the most effective<br>across a wide range of countries<br>i will<br>point you towards uh some recent work<br>that david skilling<br>um new zealand economists has produced a<br>simple hybrid index of economic health<br>measures<br>and economic outcome measures and it<br>puts new zealand<br>you know at the top towards the top end<br>of the nation's global response<br>uh with the massive caveat that the<br>pandemic is not over yet of course<br>the reserve banks uh<br>monetary policy response you know<br>looking ahead um so you know that was it<br>was the early stages and then more<br>recently and looking ahead<br>uh our policy response is always going<br>to be based on achieving our mandate<br>we set our policy responses on<br>the information we have to date in hand<br>our assessment of how we think the<br>economy best works<br>and of course<br>retaining optionality around being able<br>to evolve policy through time<br>and be resilient to<br>any unanticipated future economic shocks<br>we are of course aware that monetary<br>policy can only provide a temporary<br>buffer to any economic shock and really<br>it's by bringing forward household<br>spending and investment or delaying<br>household spending and investments so<br>you know we understand that our impact<br>on the real economic activity is is<br>primarily temporary<br>as more information has become available<br>and we've had time to observe how our<br>economy and the global economic outlook<br>has evolved<br>our policy response has evolved<br>in aggregate we've been very pleased<br>with how remarkably resilient<br>the economy has remained in face of such<br>high uncertainty and<br>economic and social restrictions<br>we managed to avoid the worst scenarios<br>of embedded deflation and unemployment<br>but we now face a more traditional<br>challenge of<br>contro constraining<br>consumer price inflation<br>but still within this unique context of<br>this covet 19 pandemic<br>we're now sure that employment is above<br>its maximum sustainable level and we are<br>very sure that inflation is too high<br>and this is occurring of course this<br>challenge for us is occurring at a time<br>when new zealand is now experiencing its<br>first widespread<br>to a significant extent the recent<br>increases in the consumer price<br>inflation have been driven by global<br>disruptions that have caused very sharp<br>upward price pressures in the economy uh<br>in particular for critical commodities<br>but a broad range of imported goods and<br>services<br>i you know i've just referred to the<br>events that are ongoing at the moment in<br>europe that's just another example of<br>how commodity prices can spike we've<br>seen in our um<br>oil prices uh well north of us 100 per<br>barrel so<br>this is uh these prices are things that<br>monetary policy can do nothing about<br>particularly new zealand's monetary<br>policy<br>in the decade prior to the pandemic all<br>of this imported consumer and price and<br>consumer price inflation into new<br>zealand was actually putting a downward<br>pressure on overall cpi inflation<br>we had these deflationary tradables<br>price pressures and they make up a very<br>large proportion around 40 percent of<br>new zealand's total consumer price index<br>basket and they acted as an anchor to<br>total headline inflation<br>meanwhile domestic driven consumer price<br>inflation the the non-tradables<br>inflation averaged more than two percent<br>per annum<br>over these years so headline cpi<br>inflation was being constrained by below<br>average tradables inflation and above<br>midpoint uh non-tradables inflation<br>downward pressure on prices from global<br>competition and technology uh progress<br>has at least for now abated um this has<br>resulted from uh the pandemic induced<br>shocks to changes in demand patterns for<br>example from services to goods<br>the ongoing supply disruptions that<br>are everywhere and the reduced mobility<br>of goods services and labor<br>what it means is that we can no longer<br>rely on declining price pressures from<br>these internationally traded goods and<br>services and central banks globally are<br>grappling with exactly this challenge<br>new zealand's monetary policy of course<br>has no direct influence on these<br>imported uh global prices other than<br>perhaps indirectly through our exchange<br>rate and even then that relationship is<br>the global nature of the economic shock<br>really has meant that exchange rates<br>have been incredibly stable over recent<br>times the whole world experienced this<br>kobe 19 shock at the same time and it<br>means there has been very little<br>relative work for exchange rates to do<br>um adjusting to the shocks and in fact<br>over over recent months what we've seen<br>is that global interest rate<br>differentials have narrowed<br>as other central banks have moved<br>towards uh more of the tightening<br>horizon that we have and we've seen the<br>new zealand trade weighted index<br>exchange rate um decline and it's<br>currently down around seven um if not a<br>slightly higher uh percent down around<br>seven to eight percent from um it's<br>pretty pandemic level<br>the most notable driver inflation<br>pressures has been um<br>in terms of new zealand has been uh oil<br>prices but i will say that these<br>that tradable inflation is far more<br>widespread than just oil prices<br>the global economy continues um<br>to struggle to supply sufficient goods<br>and services to meet the strong ongoing<br>demand there's both a catch up from<br>from<br>demand running ahead of the supply and<br>there's also continued ongoing supply to<br>the future<br>so the degree of inflationary pressures<br>experienced across economies has to some<br>extent<br>very much depended on the different<br>starting points for economies as they<br>headed into the economic pandemic we do<br>have to remember that most of our<br>advanced<br>economy trading partners had experience<br>for a very long long time<br>very low and subdued inflation<br>and persistently high unemployment in<br>fact it was only until recently<br>the central banks of japan the united<br>states the euro area australia and less<br>so here in new zealand we're all<br>increasingly concerned about<br>undershooting their inflation targets<br>rather than overshooting and obviously<br>this has since been tipped on its head<br>um by this pandemic<br>central banks are now signaling and<br>undertaking policy tightening these<br>policy responses do vary across<br>countries based on the starting points<br>for inflation for output gaps for<br>employment but they're all heading in<br>the same direction around reducing<br>stimulus and starting to tighten<br>monetary policy<br>enough about what's going on<br>internationally around which we have<br>limited influence if any<br>back here at home<br>domestic inflation pressures have also<br>been rising and this is an important<br>reason why the committee has responded<br>recently with tightening policy<br>and why we continue to have to expect to<br>do so<br>until we know that our inflation<br>expectations are well anchored and we<br>will have uh consumer price inflation<br>back within our target range<br>uh in one sense this is uh business as<br>usual<br>new zealand has a long history of<br>of bringing inflation down<br>as does the rest of the world where we<br>have a shorter history of working out<br>how to bring domestic inflation back up<br>so we're using our tried and trusted<br>monetary policy approach and that's to<br>ensure that inflation comes back into<br>its target and of course we have to do<br>this without causing undue volatility<br>and interest rates the exchange rate and<br>output and employment itself<br>again this is our mandate it's our<br>business as usual<br>our path of least regrets has now become<br>one where we must ensure that consumer<br>price inflation and inflation<br>expectations do not rise persistently<br>above our target level and i think<br>anything less risks long-term economic<br>costs and reduced well-being for all new<br>zealanders<br>i suppose to highlight<br>our resolve to meet our remit<br>it's useful to compare our actions<br>globally amongst many of our central<br>bank pairs we were one of the first to<br>begin<br>removing monetary stimulus and start<br>this tightening cycle<br>we ceased our quantitative easing<br>activities in mid last year july 2021<br>and this was by ending the purchase of<br>our purchases of government bonds<br>and over the remainder of 2021 and until<br>recently we have now lifted the official<br>cash rate three times so by 75 basis<br>points<br>importantly we've also signed all these<br>more to come<br>and we have talked a lot about where we<br>believe the neutral<br>nominal interest rate is and how far we<br>may need to go above neutral<br>to achieve our inflation targets so<br>really the idea is we're taking our foot<br>off the accelerator as quickly as<br>possible<br>to avoid having to use the brake<br>unnecessarily in the future to maintain<br>our inflation mandate<br>so that's all um<br>strictly central banking<br>tasks nothing particularly unique or<br>unusual globally more unique and unusual<br>historically<br>uh some of the challenges that we've had<br>to face through all of this<br>have been um you know have provided<br>great lessons and and<br>we'll talk about how we're going to try<br>and capture these lessons and work with<br>everyone on this call<br>in the near future<br>one real interesting challenge was the<br>immense government fiscal support that<br>occurred internationally<br>it was very timely it was well received<br>and necessary<br>the level of of that fiscal support in<br>response to the pandemic was much larger<br>than we've seen in any recent shocks and<br>that was both in timeliness and scale<br>in new zealand fiscal support for<br>bolstering aggregate demand was very<br>welcomed by the monetary policy<br>committee given the size and the pace of<br>the shock we were dealing with<br>given the ongoing low nominal interest<br>rate environments and given some of the<br>very specific supply side effects of<br>of the health response that<br>we're undertaking globally and of course<br>here in new zealand<br>we do acknowledge now though that the<br>bulk of the fiscal impulse is<br>behind us<br>the government's response to the covert<br>19 pandemic was very strong over 2020<br>2021 and looking ahead it's becoming<br>more business as usual for fiscal policy<br>uh the treasury's current outlook<br>suggests that fiscal policy is expected<br>to be less symmetry for aggregate demand<br>in terms of impulse and hence add less<br>upward pressure on spending or potential<br>inflation in the economy<br>the committee's ongoing challenge of<br>course is to ensure that inflation<br>remains low and stable through this<br>period and that the fiscal policy can go<br>about its uh longer-term activities<br>activities<br>and i understand you all heard from<br>carolee mcleish yesterday which was a<br>very clear articulation of their<br>challenges<br>while fiscal policy has been an<br>incredibly important tool for this<br>aggregate demand<br>management i would say that monetary<br>policy will need to be stepping back up<br>more into the front line<br>over the period ahead<br>as it remains the most effective tool<br>for stabilizing uh economic activity<br>through business cycles<br>and this is largely due to the ease and<br>frequency with which we can adjust<br>policy<br>our operational independence which is<br>critical to enabling us to go about our<br>business and of course the these<br>potential significant economic costs of<br>dynamically adjusting government<br>spending taxes and transfers<br>to cyclical behaviors<br>um<br>of course we will need to continue to<br>observe uh ongoing fiscal decisions and<br>um our monetary policy actions will<br>ensure that that any implications of<br>fiscal spending uh or fiscal policy<br>taxes spending uh wells fare transfers<br>and of course uh policies around uh<br>border opening labor mobility and other<br>things that impact on the supply side of<br>the economy these are all critical<br>inputs into setting our monetary policy<br>decisions i do want to emphasize of<br>course that there is no simple rule of<br>thumb between<br>fiscal spending and an inflation outcome<br>or<br>government decisions and an inflation<br>outcome it's going to always depend on<br>the impacts of supply to the economy<br>what's happening to the long-term<br>productive capacity<br>any implications for demand and of<br>course any offsetting implications what<br>mean for private sector investment or<br>spending decisions<br>so there's no simple uh rule of thumb<br>it's all about the nature of the<br>spending the nature of the tax changes<br>and the nature of the regulatory<br>environment that ultimately depend on<br>an optimal monetary policy response<br>response<br>another real challenge for us and one<br>that has been a very high profile and<br>will continue to be really is the role<br>that monetary policy is played with<br>regard to asset prices and asset price<br>volatility in new zealand you know this<br>has been mostly evident and most talked<br>about through residential house prices<br>like high consumer price inflation the<br>rapid rise in asset price inflation has<br>been a global phenomenon<br>um but the increase in new zealand house<br>prices has been exceptional and well<br>above uh global averages and it's taken<br>new zealand house prices what i would<br>say<br>is well above a sustainable<br>level by sustainable what we can explain<br>just through traditional supply and<br>demand<br>type<br>modelling<br>our research shows that it is the<br>persistent decline in global nominal<br>interest rates that most affect asset<br>prices<br>whereas changes in new zealand's<br>official cash rate relative to the<br>global rate has a much smaller effect<br>and we've been observing this global<br>secular decline in uh interest rates<br>for at least a couple of decades uh<br>driven by that low in global and state<br>low global stable inflation um a long<br>period of very low<br>inflation and structural factors that i<br>know this audience knows well<br>demographic issues productivity issues<br>all things that affect the level of<br>expected real economic growth in the<br>long term<br>a key reason why<br>lower global interest rates have had<br>such a significant impact on house<br>prices in new zealand really has been<br>the lack of supply of housing itself<br>land use restrictions and other<br>constraints on building have restrained<br>the supply of land and hence housing<br>i do note though that this trend has<br>recently turned building consents are at<br>a record level<br>and this is at a time when the<br>population growth through 2021 was just<br>less than half of one percent its lowest<br>level since 1988<br>and mortgage interest rates are now<br>rising and there is tighter access to<br>credit<br>we're now confronted with thinking about<br>how us how asset prices will reflect<br>will react to this rising interest rate<br>environment<br>and how homeowners might react to<br>declining household balance sheet worth<br>i will reiterate that house prices have<br>remained at a very high level<br>and i will note that household balance<br>sheets and corporate balance sheets are<br>in a very strong position<br>but it will feel different if house<br>prices start to decline and we're seeing<br>aggregate household balance sheets being<br>impacted already through their kiwisaver<br>accounts and other financial investments<br>as the global economy as asset prices<br>respond internationally to rising<br>interest rates<br>we also recognise that monetary policy<br>has distributional impacts<br>including through the housing markets<br>our research has shown that monetary<br>policy easing and tightenings<br>can affect the distribution of wealth<br>and income through multiple channels<br>but our mandate is very humble and<br>appropriate it recognizes the<br>limitations that monetary policy has on<br>influencing these distributional effects<br>the best impact monetary policy can have<br>is reflected in our mandate and that is<br>through<br>maintaining low and stable inflation and<br>doing so in a manner that contributes to<br>maximum sustainable employment<br>of course tiputian mature the reserve<br>bank of new zealand is what we call a<br>full service central bank and we have<br>responsibilities for both monetary and<br>financial stability purposes<br>our purpose for responding to any<br>unsustainable asset price movements is<br>really to ensure that the broad<br>financial stability is maintained<br>we would love to ensure that both<br>borrowers and lenders are able to manage<br>their financial risks through good times<br>and bad<br>and that any specific issues to the<br>otherwise do not lead to broad financial<br>instability<br>so to manage some of the cyclical<br>drivers of financial instability we have<br>been deploying over over the recent<br>decades uh<br>an increasing suite of macro prudential<br>tools since the onset of this pandemic<br>we have been active in<br>using<br>these tools particularly the key tool<br>around our loan to value ratio<br>restrictions at the onset of the<br>pandemic crisis we removed our lvr<br>restrictions load to value<br>ratio restrictions and that was so that<br>we could be confident that monetary<br>policy would be its most effective<br>that<br>cash that banks were able to have full<br>use of their balance sheet<br>to bring forward spending and investment<br>by early 2021 we were in a much more<br>certain position and we were able to<br>see how the pandemic was evolving and we<br>were confident enough to put<br>restrictions back on our put our lvrs<br>back in place and in fact tighten them<br>in a means of heading off any undue<br>financial risk<br>and high leverage particularly for<br>people entering the housing market<br>in recent times<br>so that's uh will always remain an<br>important and active part of not just<br>monetary policy but macro prudential<br>tools to assist<br>cyclical<br>challenges the economy faces<br>another real challenge for us was both<br>and the broader bank of course and the<br>fiscal authorities was in the design the<br>implementation um the calibration and<br>the explanation of our additional<br>monetary policy tools<br>in particular on the exploration front a<br>significant challenge was this<br>persistent singling out of the new tools<br>as the cause of<br>house price inflation<br>but as we all know causation and<br>correlation are different concepts<br>the additional monetary policy tools<br>were<br>that we utilized were simply there to<br>assist lowering nominal interest rates<br>across the yield curve<br>it was up then up to the financial<br>institutions and individuals to decide<br>how to utilize these lower interest rate<br>environments it was not simply a cash<br>flow transfer from us<br>into households to buy houses it was<br>about lowering interest rates it was<br>business as usual albeit through<br>additional tools<br>uh our large-scale asset purchase<br>program<br>affects long-term interest rates really<br>through this exchange of settlement<br>accounts at the bank<br>with retail banks for their bonds and<br>that puts downward pressure on bond<br>yields and heads downward pressure on<br>the yield curve and interest rates<br>in the economy<br>the level of government bonds on offer<br>is determined solely by the government<br>the fiscal authorities not the reserve<br>bank<br>likewise the amount of bonds the<br>committee chose to buy depends solely on<br>the committee's needs<br>not the fiscal needs of government so<br>monetary and fiscal policy remains<br>separate and the operational<br>independence of the bank remains clear<br>looking ahead<br>we are continually continually reviewing<br>our work<br>to improve the implementation and<br>formulation of monetary policy<br>uh our new legislation which comes into<br>into work in july one of this year<br>actually requires us which i think is a<br>wonderful thing and consistent with what<br>we see across other best practice<br>central banks globally it requires us<br>every five years to do a thorough review<br>of these monetary policy tools<br>and the idea is to ensure that we remain<br>accountable transparent<br>effective<br>and capable to undertake<br>the monetary policy agreements<br>our review process it's now underway<br>we've kicked it off<br>internally<br>and we are about to go externally and we<br>are going to be encouraging um insisting<br>that you all take part in assisting us<br>um work through this review<br>we're thinking about it in two legs the<br>first one is a backward looking review<br>an assessment of our policy performance<br>over the last five years<br>and the other part is about formulating<br>advice on the monetary policy agreement<br>for the minister of finance about what<br>if any changes are needed going forward<br>from these lessons we are legally<br>obliged through the legislation to have<br>this advice in front of the minister of<br>finance<br>no later than towards the end of 2023<br>but this is going to be a project that<br>we're undertaking<br>it will involve public consultation and<br>the first round of public cost<br>consultation is in the middle of this<br>calendar year<br>we're going to be looking at a lot of<br>the structural changes that may have<br>impacted on the remit and the operation<br>of monetary policy and the lessons of<br>activities of recent years<br>so i encourage you to take part in this<br>it's<br>really exciting to be involved<br>and it gives us a great opportunity for<br>everyone to be able to contribute their<br>thoughts<br>i'm going to finish up then just to say<br>look what have i done i've outlined the<br>unique global context to monetary policy<br>some of the unique tools<br>and context that we've operated in<br>uh i've acknowledged the role of asset<br>prices and distributional impacts that<br>monetary policy can have<br>can have on these issues and of course<br>i've put the panui out and the flag up<br>for the review of our monetary policy<br>remit<br>kia ora alastair thank you<br>and uh the first reflection is just the<br>degree to which you and your team have<br>been in the hot seat over the last<br>couple of years um monetary policy has<br>probably<br>never had quite so many clicks on the<br>mainstream media uh than in the last<br>couple of years look a lot of questions<br>coming through over slido and please<br>keep them coming through i'm going to<br>start with a bit of a nuts and bolts one<br>you've<br>picked inflation coming back to<br>more normal levels we might call it<br>within within target ranges i believe by<br>mid 2023<br>which is sooner than some might have<br>picked and you're also looking at an<br>official cash rate uh up above three<br>almost three and a half percent out to<br>2025.<br>so can you give us guide us through the<br>committee's thinking on this<br>and where we see uh i guess<br>how long do we see inflation there what<br>gives you confidence that it's going to<br>come back within bound and yet you're<br>looking at the higher ocr out you know<br>three four years<br>wonderful the first thing that gives me<br>confidence<br>that inflation will come back<br>so the first thing that gives us uh<br>confidence around the inflation is our<br>policy remit and our operational<br>independence<br>so you know we can still uh have<br>significant and effective influence over<br>consumer price inflation within our<br>monetary domain<br>and and that's our task<br>now the second bit around around um<br>what we have to do to achieve that i<br>think it's really important to remember<br>where we're coming from is as important<br>as to where we're going with the<br>official cash rate so we're coming from<br>an extremely historically low<br>nominal interest rate<br>and a lot of the work we're doing at the<br>moment is simply getting us back to a<br>neutral a neutral interest rate and then<br>we're saying we may need to be north of<br>that for some time to be<br>effective i.e slowly stepping on the<br>break um neutral nominal interest rates<br>you know<br>i can't believe i'm saying this but we<br>say around two percent nominal that<br>still feels incredibly low historically<br>and so you know for a lot of people out<br>there in the economy this is um they're<br>going wow interest rates are rising but<br>they're going from something very low to<br>something at most quite average<br>and if not just marginally above average<br>so it's not quite as dramatic as it may<br>feel and that has been part of the<br>warnings and discussions we've been<br>trying to put out to people that normal<br>interest rates are well above where they<br>are making their first borrowing<br>decisions<br>the good news is that a lot of that rate<br>rise that we are talking about with<br>regard to the official cash rate is<br>already priced in to those forward<br>looking curves and all and in a large<br>part being reflected out there um in<br>mortgage rate land<br>and we know that<br>over half of all mortgages that<br>money that's out there at the moment is<br>going to be reset over the course of<br>this year so there's a lot built in and<br>a lot that already happen but we must<br>follow through with what we've said as<br>well um in order to to bank that um that<br>tightening that is priced at the moment<br>with regard to the actual inflation you<br>know a significant part of shifting from<br>where we you know we expect to be<br>peaking between six and a half seven<br>percent first quarter of this year i'm<br>deliberately being quite loose on the<br>first quarter cti inflation because<br>the swing variable of course is oil<br>prices and so this is the noise that<br>happens in near-term inflation<br>now a lot of those are one-off price<br>level shifts that even if they don't go<br>back down the mere fact they don't keep<br>going up you're going to see measured<br>cpi inflation come off<br>um over the course of 2022 and into 23.<br>we don't see headline cpi inflation<br>getting below the three percent you know<br>just getting into our target range until<br>next year<br>and being at the midpoint of our target<br>range until the year after so you can<br>see we are<br>still trying to<br>ensure expectations remain anchored but<br>not be too dramatic<br>to interest rates output the exchange<br>rate we're trying to focus on that<br>horizon that we are most impactful on<br>and do it in a credible transparent<br>manner<br>thank you and that thank you for the<br>clarification<br>i'm gonna go a little bit back into the<br>the days 2020 and i'm sure they were um<br>they'll stick in your memory it must<br>have been a sense of drama almost<br>certainly across the world as everybody<br>was figuring out how to respond to the<br>situation and then maybe look forward<br>you've talked about the legislation<br>requiring review i think that's<br>excellent that's part of the long run of<br>you'd say new zealand's legislative<br>tools around central banking which have<br>put us in a very strong position<br>when you go back into that period when<br>was it that the bank<br>made the switch and i guess all of the<br>world and if you consider the the<br>economic consensus at the time around<br>demand shock<br>and then of course we've said now<br>actually it was more on the supply side<br>when did the bank start seeing that and<br>and start switching that view because of<br>course many of us have gone through and<br>we all know a lot more now so it's a lot<br>easier 2020 hindsight when did the bank<br>start seeing this as more of a supply<br>shock versus demand<br>yeah so i would say right from the<br>outset<br>we were very convinced it was going to<br>be both a demand and a supply shock<br>but in our least regrets framework uh<br>and given that demand is immediate<br>supply takes time<br>um we were<br>could see very strongly that the risks<br>even though it's both demanding supply<br>this will dominate demand will dominate<br>first<br>and we needed to<br>dramatically reduce<br>monetary conditions we also had to<br>dramatically reduce monetary conditions<br>because<br>being the only one standing there<br>was higher than otherwise interest rates<br>etc we would have had the exchange rate<br>going through the roof so part of it<br>so<br>the immediate shock to demand and supply<br>demand wins today do that and then let's<br>see where the dust settles around what<br>the supply capacity or constraints<br>actually are in the future<br>when did the supply can when did we have<br>confidence around the demand<br>had stabilized and when did supply<br>the supply issues really start to become<br>evident that was uh<br>more towards the end of and i'm<br>struggling to do more towards the end of<br>2020 and this is when we had said um you<br>know<br>don't expect a lot more we are just<br>maintaining monetary conditions at this<br>low level we're not looking for<br>additional things to do<br>and fiscal policy was the main show in<br>town we were actively trying to take<br>monetary policy off the stage<br>and say this is from here a fiscal<br>policy show<br>and<br>that was because of the more the more<br>targeted nature that fiscal policy and<br>general government um policy could take<br>on sectors of the economy on supply side<br>issues of the economy that monetary<br>policy just said no no effort over and<br>as<br>economic resilience<br>proved both on the global side in<br>particular and the holding up of<br>commodity prices and our terms of trade<br>holding up and as we saw the wage<br>support and businesses maintain balance<br>sheets maintain their strength through<br>through all of the<br>unprecedented uh fiscal policy response<br>that gave us the confidence by mid 2021<br>that we could now start to exit this<br>extraordinary uh monetary policy<br>loosening period and start to<br>renormalize<br>uh in a manner now remember all this is<br>still being done in the environment of<br>the ongoing rolling pandemic<br>you know it's heady times yeah without<br>even factoring in the um the events in<br>europe overnight so<br>it might be a last question given time<br>constraints we could we could go for<br>hours um it's a theme again of what have<br>we learned and also looking forward<br>you've touched on distributional impacts<br>i i look at the the banner behind you um<br>well-being and prosperity for all new<br>zealanders and i know that you have made<br>that a central point of um of the bank's<br>focus<br>obviously some are sitting out there<br>saying this is the the stimulus that was<br>needed in the early days this has had<br>quite devastating impacts on those that<br>might not get into the housing market<br>you have made very clear there are only<br>so many levers the bank has<br>but thinking now again hindsight 2020 is<br>much easier but with hindsight as you go<br>into this review period if we were to<br>have another similar crisis what have we<br>learned<br>from the early days of what we as a<br>nation went through then<br>or as one of the questions came through<br>did we over rig it did we over stimulate<br>the economy in retrospect and what might<br>we do differently now<br>which i say isn't necessarily a critique<br>on where we were because now we have<br>more information but what have we<br>learned out of last time that we could<br>i would say first and foremost build<br>houses<br>you know this is the continuous<br>challenge of<br>wanting our cake and eating it too not<br>in my backyard not on my watch i'm<br>against it<br>challenges<br>that writ large globally but especially<br>strong in new zealand<br>we had an unbelievable population growth<br>and a very very poor response<br>around housing i would be thinking hard<br>around the lack of depth and breadth of<br>our broader capital markets<br>which you know generally means that so<br>much of our intermediation is done<br>through<br>through uh reliance on housing as<br>collateral and also housing and as an<br>investment tool so those are much longer<br>structural things<br>i'm not um obfuscating from where the<br>central bank is but i actually think<br>it's really small um<br>incremental improvements you would make<br>around monetary policy relative to<br>significant changes you can make outside<br>of this institution<br>when you say whether have we under over<br>egged it well you know core inflation is<br>at the top end of our ban maximum<br>employment is<br>slightly above its maximum sustainable<br>employment i would say that's not a bad<br>outcome to date given from where we've<br>been and we're now<br>still firmly in control of of keeping<br>inflation down<br>what uh did the committee most struggle<br>with throughout<br>getting line of sight and timeliness<br>around fiscal policy responses you think<br>internationally fiscal policy had been<br>told go away as an aggregate demand<br>manager um yet globally fiscal policy<br>appropriately immediately stepped up and<br>became the most significant<br>we had no real experience in new zealand<br>of direct wage subsidies or business<br>guarantee schemes etc around how that<br>would support and bolster housing so<br>that ongoing connectedness of monetary<br>and fiscal policy whilst retaining<br>the the operational independence is<br>critical<br>number one and number two the terrorists<br>uh tipu tiamata and the treasury worked<br>incredibly closely together and so but<br>we can always<br>think much harder you know i would love<br>the academic<br>effort<br>capability in this audience to be<br>thinking around that monetary fiscal<br>policy response and how<br>our supply side of our economy can be<br>more flexible to ongoing ongoing shocks<br>and innovation<br>um i see a um<br>a whole branch of uh<br>academic articles coming out on this<br>period over the years ahead i mean it's<br>it's been some heady times look we're at<br>the end of our time adrian thank you so<br>much for your time and and for your<br>team's time uh we'll of course now have<br>a policy uh a panel on monetary policy<br>so we'll get other views coming in and<br>then a session on fiscal policy as well<br>there are a lot of questions on the<br>inter-relationship between those two uh<br>part of a longer conversation another<br>time i think<br>but for today thank you again and wish<br>you well kiara until next time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
