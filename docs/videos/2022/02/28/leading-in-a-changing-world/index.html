sit<br>relative to uh the last<br>40 years anyway<br>by talking to a former prime minister<br>who has seen a lot of things in his time<br>in government<br>jim bulger of course was in government<br>in the 70s 80s and 90s<br>which makes him a much more resilient<br>politician than i ever was<br>and<br>understands that sweep of history and<br>that challenge of change<br>so<br>we are in tumultuous times we are<br>certainly seeing a lot of change right<br>now so i'm pleased to be able to<br>introduce jim<br>thank you for joining us<br>and uh it's great to have you here<br>thank you thank you stephen thank you<br>everybody and good afternoon all sorry<br>we can't meet in person we could have a<br>chat and find the real thinking of<br>people look good beside the government<br>of the reserve bank and see what he's<br>really going to do with interest rates<br>but<br>now we can't do that so it's<br>disappointing we can't get beside<br>everybody but the changes that the<br>pandemic has caused of course to society<br>being touched on by many if not all the<br>speakers today and the implications of<br>those are still to be played out and how<br>we might see them but i want to very<br>warmly congratulate the university<br>for bringing together what i describe as<br>a stellar lineup of speakers i think<br>it's tremendous<br>and i especially acknowledge my former<br>colleague the right honourable helen<br>clark<br>for her i think insightful thoughts on a<br>variety of issues particularly<br>international ones<br>collectively of course very important<br>issues have been raised and discussed<br>and i hope that they will encourage<br>people to seek<br>new or search for new thinking and new<br>ideas<br>as i put it here i don't believe we can<br>continue to rely on adam smith's wealth<br>of nations which was written in 1776<br>for today's problems<br>from a new zealand perspective it's<br>important that this forum continues if i<br>might add plug for the university<br>um as an annual on an annual basis a<br>sort of a new zealand davis if you like<br>where ideas can be promoted debated<br>shared discussed<br>as you probably know from the<br>program my the title of my remarks is<br>leading in a changing world my approach<br>to that is to challenge all of us to<br>think carefully but boldly on the<br>leadership our changing world requires<br>not used to my changing world if we<br>don't do something about it<br>on the issue of leadership<br>there are two big issues that leaders<br>must face<br>one is a willingness to when necessary<br>to put old ideas aside that's a<br>challenge and display the capacity to<br>embrace new ideas and accept that some<br>earlier decisions you made were now<br>wrong or simply that circumstances have<br>changed<br>and secondly most importantly to have<br>the ability to see as it were a<br>different tomorrow<br>a more just tomorrow we've talked a lot<br>about that more just tomorrow and then<br>the ability to devise determine or<br>detect emerging new options and the<br>courage<br>importantly the courage to accept them<br>big issues like a four day week or even<br>a universal basic income now that might<br>address some of the social issues we<br>talked about today prepare the public<br>for the impact that artificial<br>intelligence and robots will have on the<br>world of work those in leadership<br>positions and it's always difficult need<br>to talk about the implications of these<br>and how we might respond to them<br>easy to say<br>but with regards to economic policy many<br>are inclined to stay with the tried and<br>true and hope for better results the<br>next time around<br>here albert einstein's definition of<br>insanity is relevant<br>broadly it was repeat the same policy<br>but expect a different result<br>it doesn't work<br>that means if we want different outcomes<br>and every speaker has been in that space<br>want different outcomes tomorrow<br>if we want a more equitable and fair<br>society tomorrow if we want more focus<br>on protecting mother earth<br>then policies have to change that's the<br>bottom line<br>the challenge of change was reflected on<br>by keynes when he observed that quote<br>and the facts change<br>i changed my mind<br>what do you do sir<br>the answer to that question from my<br>experience is that most seek to find a<br>way to avoid whatever the issue is<br>take for example just been touched on<br>the reality that with an ageing<br>population new zealand world too we will<br>have to slowly raise the age at which<br>people qualify for universal<br>superannuation<br>the oecd raised the issue again in its<br>recent report but again it was just<br>brushed aside<br>every economist and leader at this<br>gathering knows<br>that the age at which people qualify for<br>national superannuation must go up and<br>the sooner we and the government have<br>the courage to say so<br>the more time people<br>have to prepare<br>further it's a given that we need to<br>protect the vulnerable with this change<br>my term as prime minister we faced the<br>issue and lifted the qualifying age from<br>60 to 65 over a five-year period<br>and while it was strongly opposed at the<br>time you would have noted that no<br>politician now says it should go back to<br>60 years<br>my point is that to make big difficult<br>changes you need to have done your<br>homework that's essential then you have<br>to have the political courage to front<br>up to your critics and explain to them<br>the need for the change<br>and remember<br>difficult issues don't go away by<br>ignoring them<br>thinking of courage<br>i'm sure that all have watched some of<br>the remarkable athletes demonstrating<br>their incredible skills<br>at the beijing winter olympics just<br>amazing stuff<br>but you may have also been fortunate<br>enough to see on the screen another<br>woman of courage named finna cooper<br>holding the hand of a young child as she<br>started a decoy from the far north to<br>parliament<br>so little history to start<br>yes it has relevance to the issue of<br>change<br>the late dane finna commenced her long<br>march in late 1975 to deliver a petition<br>to parliament on historic grievances<br>regarding the alienation of maori land<br>she addressed her remarks to the then<br>prime minister bill rowling and all<br>members of parliament<br>the petition which is framed and hangs<br>in a prominent position in our home our<br>home is dated the 13th of october 1975<br>and states in its opening<br>quote greetings to you in whose assembly<br>is vested all the powers to amend and<br>adjust all laws which inflict injustice<br>and hardship of the maori people and in<br>whom is vested the power to confirm all<br>promises which are made to give relief<br>to the indigenous people of new zealand<br>under her majesty's magna carta long<br>lived the queen<br>quote ended quote the petition then<br>advanced some key issues that should be<br>addressed<br>a few and a few weeks later of course<br>the november 75 election was held and<br>saw a return of the national party and a<br>different prime minister rob mulder<br>and i was appointed the parliamentary<br>under secretary to the minister of<br>agriculture and the minister of maori<br>affairs the right honourable duncan<br>mcintyre in that position i became chair<br>of the maori affair select committee and<br>as chair of the committee i agreed to<br>hold a meeting to hear name phoenix<br>petition in auckland<br>i must add that petition had over 200<br>additional signatures as well as dame<br>penis<br>we on the committee heard passionate<br>submissions outlining the many<br>grievances that in common justice had to<br>be addressed<br>now let me move forward 15 years to 1990<br>when i became prime minister and drawing<br>on the developments of those years and<br>reflecting on dan fino's petition<br>petition<br>i decided that the honor of the country<br>demandeth that we must do better<br>with the support of other ministers but<br>especially sir douglas graham then<br>minister of treaty negotiations we<br>started a new approach<br>that new approach was clearly going to<br>cost much more and the treasury<br>suggested an additional 250 million<br>but they clearly would have been<br>inadequate so i put forward 1 billion<br>yes a huge sum in those days but already<br>the cost is over 2 billion and much more<br>to come<br>from my perspective a relatively small<br>amount to help bring honor to new<br>zealand and help create the huge and<br>growing maori economy of which we heard<br>a little about earlier today i was<br>pleased to hear it<br>a few days back<br>the euro we're aboard<br>which i remember held its regular<br>meeting<br>and thinking back to my title leading in<br>a changing world<br>you may recall how seven years back the<br>then minister of treaty negotiation the<br>honorable chris finlayson<br>and touhou agreed to a totally new and<br>bold approach to settling natahu's<br>treaty claims<br>i was involved in the last meetings<br>instead of long and divisive<br>negotiations on who owned the<br>eurowearers the crown and twohoy agreed<br>to a totally new approach<br>that the euros own itself<br>the land which endures forever<br>owns itself<br>and we who live but a short while<br>have a duty to care for the land<br>that the euro board has the<br>responsibility to speak in law to speak<br>for the land and care for the land<br>that new approach has now been picked up<br>by other countries like canada and india<br>now the hard part they're not getting<br>weight easy<br>hard parts and the challenge to senior<br>economic thinkers<br>looking out at the gross inequality<br>spoken about often today<br>the inequality<br>across new zealand and the world can you<br>suggest<br>an equally bold new approach<br>as we did in treaty settlements<br>surely<br>no one is going to suggest just tinker<br>with the present model<br>with hunger and climate crisis advancing<br>almost everywhere<br>for example<br>the whole back hunger in new zealand<br>in 2022 we distribute more and more food<br>parcels<br>we don't talk much about that when<br>talking of a team of 5 million or when<br>talking about the strength of the<br>economy<br>and we don't talk about how daily more<br>families can't afford a home that's been<br>touched on<br>and about 10 000 are in emergency<br>housing costing<br>350 million<br>when i went<br>on the q a program on tv one a few weeks<br>back discussing the characteristics i<br>would look for in a leader<br>i drew on professor rebecca henderson of<br>harvard's<br>new book titled reimagining capitalism<br>in a world on fire<br>i encourage you all to read it<br>as she dissects much that she sees as<br>wrong with the current economic model<br>model you don't have to agree with all<br>of it but looking around new zealand and<br>the world we do need<br>we do need to reimagine capitalism<br>i won't try and cover all the points<br>made in the book i won't do that at all<br>i'll just instead quote a little from<br>the back page<br>back cover<br>reimagining it said<br>reimagining capitalism in a world on<br>fire is the definitive book about the<br>make or break point now facing business<br>the capitalist system as we know it is<br>doomed unless we can really fix climate<br>change raise wages remake our politics<br>and take meaningful action about the<br>issues of inequality and structural<br>racism we've touched on those today<br>it goes on reimagining capitalism<br>requires balancing the enormous power of<br>the free market with the power of<br>democratic accountable government and<br>strong civil society in the quote<br>but to back it up i'll give you a stark<br>example from the book rate based on u.s<br>statistics unfortunately i couldn't find<br>comparable ones for new zealand<br>but these are stark<br>between 1946 and 1980<br>us total pre-tax income nearly doubled<br>the poorest half of the population saw<br>their income increased slightly more<br>than it's yeah slightly more than double<br>well the richest 10<br>saw slightly smaller increase<br>then going forward and this is the<br>crucial bit that we're dealing with<br>today<br>going forward between 1980 and 2014<br>pre-tax national income grew by 61<br>but the income of the poorest half grew<br>by only 1<br>while the income of the top 10<br>grew by 121<br>just reflect on that for a moment when<br>we were talking about inequality earlier<br>and the income of the top 1 of course<br>more than tripled<br>if you want a more just and more<br>equitable world we have much work to do<br>so where to next<br>going forward we could hopefully agree<br>that the environment is a common good<br>belonging to all and meant for all so we<br>should treat it accordingly<br>can we also agree<br>on the principle in principle<br>with the goal of meeting the needs of<br>all<br>rather than the unlimited wants greed<br>of the few<br>if you sign up to those two points<br>you are signing up to a big change in<br>how we measure progress<br>i believe such a change is needed and<br>agree with the economist and thinker<br>professor jeffrey sachs who put it this<br>way<br>quote our greatest illusion is that a<br>healthy society can be organized by the<br>single-minded pursuit of wealth<br>close quote<br>today the almost universal measure of<br>success<br>is economic growth is measured by gdp<br>gross domestic product<br>in the context of this discussion<br>to really measure societal progress we<br>must develop must develop a more<br>inclusive index that not only measures<br>money transactions but also important<br>personal and community issues such as<br>health education all touched on housing<br>of course pollution and broader<br>environmental issues to replace gdp as a<br>measure of progress<br>dr marilyn waring a doctoral graduate of<br>this university is one of those who has<br>written extensively on this issue and i<br>invite thought leaders here today and<br>elsewhere to engage with her because we<br>mustn't just talk about these issues we<br>must develop policies to address them<br>that's the important part going forward<br>developing new policies and please don't<br>say it's too hard<br>think of the changes we have accepted in<br>our lives in response to the covert<br>pandemic we've agreed to isolate<br>ourselves for long stretches we have<br>worked attended meetings and had deeply<br>personal conversations talking to our<br>computers or laptops<br>we've taken online courses and seen<br>doctors and therapists using<br>telemedicine<br>people previously ignored are now<br>designated as essential workers but<br>unfortunately are often still on a very<br>modest income<br>but a little bit of courage and that's<br>simple to resolve i could go on<br>but back to the beginning<br>the issue is to find the political will<br>in the public world to accept big policy<br>shifts<br>so let me conclude<br>this is not a call to overthrow<br>capitalism but a call to use the energy<br>and drive of individual initiative and<br>open markets to create new opportunities<br>but having done that<br>to change the discussion from only<br>individual advancement<br>to community advancement<br>leading in a changing world requires we<br>move past economic slogans or slogan<br>economics and select pr through to<br>carefully thought out policies that<br>address real community concerns<br>and important<br>listen carefully<br>and sadly there are very<br>many unhappy people across new zealand<br>today<br>don't just dismiss them as losers or nut<br>cases yes some maybe<br>but as a society we need to hear and<br>respond to legitimate concerns<br>this could as others have said be a very<br>challenging issue<br>if the world economy was to move into<br>recession as a result of the russian<br>i leave it there<br>thank you for your attention i'm happy<br>to accept your questions<br>thank you very much jim that was a very<br>thought provoking and<br>appropriately challenging<br>uh set of comments so thank you very<br>much indeed<br>um i'm<br>happy to have questions we've got one or<br>two on the on the question machine<br>so please please pass them and i'm going<br>to ask jim a couple of things to start<br>us off uh we've got about 10 minutes to<br>go<br>um jim<br>in terms of your own experience in<br>politics<br>yeah we're going through obviously a<br>quite dramatic period of change brought<br>on by the pandemic first time in 100<br>years<br>we all know about the challenges<br>of russia's<br>approach to the ukraine<br>and<br>the world has to some degree been tipped<br>up<br>over the last two years<br>from what was a reasonably settled uh<br>period prior to that or at least back to<br>the gfc<br>but<br>in terms of your experiences and your<br>understanding of political history how<br>do you think this period rates as over<br>the last say uh last 100 years uh or at<br>least back to the 70s i mean we are we<br>dealing with the sort of changes that we<br>were dealing<br>when britain joined the eu and and so on<br>which was you know really tipped up new<br>zealand society<br>what do you think where do you think we<br>sit in this current period in terms of<br>the dramatic nature of the change or are<br>we dealing with a passing phenomenon<br>i don't think it's passing i think it's<br>uh<br>permanent and the change will be<br>permanent<br>and uh<br>and that's why i touched on things like<br>a four day working week and uh even the<br>universal basic income i think there are<br>big big issues coming down<br>and i would like to see society<br>discussing them i'd like our leaders to<br>be discussing them<br>even if they want to dismiss them i<br>think you can't just brush them out but<br>i think if you go right back<br>uh to the 30s depression which uh some<br>of us uh don't remember but we know of<br>from parents talking about them um<br>uh the<br>the challenge is in that scale i think<br>to face an entirely different world and<br>why that's important and why it fits<br>into my remarks statement is that<br>at that stage after that there was a<br>radical change in economic thinking and<br>economic policy<br>the difference between the response of<br>the government today and the response to<br>the government in the 30s is stark in<br>the 30s they still tried to balance the<br>books<br>there was front and center of the<br>finance minister of new zealand's goals<br>at that stage it was a disaster<br>this time<br>the finance minister almost seems to<br>have had a policy to print more money<br>you know we've increased our debt<br>dramatically to take new zealand through<br>this period so i think we have<br>approached it quite differently we need<br>to<br>but we are still not focusing on<br>approaching the change that technology<br>is going to pick up and move forward<br>afterwards after the pandemic<br>you mentioned superannuation<br>and<br>i think we both speak as people who at<br>least tried to<br>adjust the super age unfortunately in my<br>case in 2017 winston had other ideas um<br>but um<br>but<br>is there room now do you think for a<br>consensus on on some of these things<br>unfortunately the default position of<br>governments seems to be<br>you know let's not scare the horses<br>let's not make the chain let's<br>kick the can down the road<br>but i suppose with a pandemic you can<br>argue don't waste a good crisis if you<br>need to actually make some of these<br>changes you should get on with it and<br>that's the old winston churchill quote<br>isn't it<br>absolutely i should get on with it<br>clearly as i said you know deferring big<br>decisions doesn't make them go away and<br>this decision only gets worse people<br>need to know what's certainly one of the<br>challenges that we know people are<br>uncertain in today's world one of the<br>challenges is to bring back certainty<br>you need to managing change big change<br>is go from a period of certainty a<br>position sorry of certainty then move<br>quickly through the uncertain page place<br>to certainty again quick as possible<br>don't leave people<br>pondering the uncertainty<br>give them the facts tell them what's<br>going to happen and move there and don't<br>waffle around<br>that's a very good point because you<br>touched on<br>the disaffected through covert<br>and the most visible group is the people<br>camped outside parliament<br>but we don't have to walk very far in<br>life to hear other people now who are<br>also disaffected and have had their<br>lives turned up and i think of the time<br>in history uh with uh longi government<br>and the end of smps and so on where you<br>know there was a probably a similar you<br>know where people had been doing the<br>right thing they've been doing the<br>things the government told them to do<br>and then suddenly it all changed on them<br>and that feels a bit like that today for<br>some of these industries<br>uh so so what's your message there<br>because they would sit and say gosh not<br>more change yeah we need some return to<br>normality<br>well they need to go to a new normality<br>they have to move from the position of<br>stability they had before the pandemic<br>to the new position of stability as<br>quickly as possible that means<br>government policies have to be made<br>quickly firmly and clear so people know<br>where they're going to be and we must<br>move away from just leaving it all<br>floating in the air and because that's<br>what kills people metaphorically i mean<br>the uncertainty of not knowing what<br>tomorrow brings try and remove the<br>uncertainty and give people certainty<br>what people want to know is certainty in<br>their lives that's been one of the<br>debates through the pandemic<br>with a lot of people arguing for more<br>certainty from the government uh now<br>when will this happen when will that<br>happen and then supporters of the<br>government coming back and saying well<br>we don't know so you know the prime<br>minister's right to say we don't know<br>but what you're saying is i i'm<br>detecting anyway and you you correct me<br>is that you're better to say something<br>definitive anyway almost as definitive<br>as you can be<br>i think but most of these issues we<br>could be definitive on i mean i think<br>while the pandemic is<br>untamed if that's the word<br>the<br>uncertainty was unnecessary in some<br>spaces i mean the uncertainty about<br>instant testing has been unnecessary i<br>mean we could have made that decision a<br>long time ago we could have made the<br>decision that we had the testing kits in<br>new zealand now not still just waiting<br>for them they'll be here tomorrow maybe<br>the next day or the day after or the<br>week after<br>there are things you can do if that's<br>your ambition to get certainty and i<br>think we need to do more of that but we<br>need to do more of it across the economy<br>too i mean it'll be foolish to pretend<br>that this<br>pandemic is just going to have an impact<br>and then vanish<br>we started today or yesterday with the<br>starting the rise of interest rates well<br>i through my political career lives<br>through very very very high interest<br>rates and now all about very very high<br>inflation rates and if anybody believes<br>and i'd like some of the economists to<br>respond i know we can't in this forum<br>but um anybody believes that the<br>inflation just going to go up and then<br>vanish<br>i'd invite them to read history because<br>that's not what's going to happen that's<br>unfortunate it's worse than unfortunate<br>but that's what we're going to now<br>struggle with for a few years to get<br>inflation back down to the levels we<br>want which is three percent up to a<br>maximum of three percent in the reserve<br>bank act so i<br>think we're in for a challenging<br>transition<br>and the clearer we can give advice to<br>the public as to what's going to happen<br>the more stable society will be<br>thank you<br>two quick questions to finish uh from<br>the from the viewers<br>firstly uh one of them says beyond gdp<br>and welfare<br>uh sorry well-being economics<br>the the economics of well-being and and<br>and the term beyond gpdp has been around<br>now for about 20 years and it's been<br>promoted by organizations such as the<br>oecd<br>why do you think it hasn't had more<br>traction in the last 20 years<br>when it's obviously something you feel<br>quite strongly about as well<br>because it's more complex and people<br>like the simplicity of gdp it's same in<br>black and white metaphorically stephen<br>you can just count it and measure it and<br>add but i've often used the example the<br>extraordinary tragedy of the terrorist<br>attack in the crisis mosques that added<br>to gdp<br>the help that society gave to those<br>distraught communities<br>added nothing<br>in the terms of measuring gdp<br>and the starkness of those two positions<br>i think should persuade more new<br>zealanders that we need a different<br>measure and i just go back i visited the<br>remote himalayan kingdom of bhutan once<br>a few years back and in that remote<br>kingdom in the mountains beautiful place<br>on a sunny day wouldn't be that good in<br>winter<br>and<br>they introduced<br>a global happiness index yes challenging<br>complex to contemplate how you measure<br>that but they are moving forward on it<br>and i wish them well<br>and finally<br>a very<br>a topic that sort of um<br>casts a shadow on this gathering and<br>around the world of course is<br>ukraine and russia<br>questioner has asked from your<br>experience in washington um of course<br>you were ambassador there for our<br>country for a period of time what advice<br>would you give president biden now if<br>you had the opportunity<br>regarding russia and the ukraine<br>first of all he has to be firm<br>from my perspective and it's only my<br>perspective and there's many writing on<br>this<br>uh president putin has decided there is<br>a weakness in the western position<br>he has very cleverly<br>orchestrated the move i don't think it<br>was going back when he<br>assisted those two provinces to break<br>away from ukraine proper but he now has<br>a<br>sort of an explainable cause he's going<br>in to help to independent republics he<br>will already or has already started to<br>say they are threatened by ukraine and<br>therefore he has to send in troops to<br>protect them<br>the tragic reminder this is telling you<br>and me<br>is when hitler invaded the sudan land<br>in czechoslovakia as an excuse to start<br>world war ii<br>and he had the same reason that the<br>student people were mainly german<br>speakers just as the ones and the two<br>breakaway provinces are mainly russian<br>speakers in fact they're all russian<br>speakers through there but so we're<br>seeing history sadly<br>has appearances of repeating hopefully<br>the power of the<br>his persuasive power and the solidarity<br>of the western country who demonstrably<br>collectively much stronger<br>than russia will persuade putin that the<br>ultimate folly he could do is to try and<br>start a proper war but<br>god willing that's what happens but at<br>the moment we're in a very unstable<br>position<br>and that unstability instability is<br>going to impact on new zealand whether<br>it's through economics or through<br>societal value so it's a tough time<br>stephen yep<br>thank you jim um and i concur with your<br>worries about um the echoes of history<br>in that regard<br>look thank you very very much for your<br>time this afternoon uh very much<br>appreciated it<br>uh and i think the challenge you've<br>given is one that this forum is up up<br>for in terms of becoming a place to<br>share ideas and challenge ourselves to<br>examine new ideas which is the whole<br>point if you can't do it in a forum like<br>this then then where can you do it so<br>thank you very much that's why i brought<br>in that huge change we made in the<br>treaty settlements<br>we moved from trying to spend endless<br>times determining whose land it was<br>and took a totally new and bold approach<br>and i think in economic thinking and<br>i've listened to the whole of today's<br>presentation and has been very very good<br>i'm still waiting to see the new<br>thinking<br>most of it was repeating thinking i've<br>heard for many many years i really<br>encourage people to try and think a<br>different framework<br>thank you very much<br>everybody</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
