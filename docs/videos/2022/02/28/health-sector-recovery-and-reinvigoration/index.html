first deep dive into one of our<br>sectors<br>um that we're examining as part of<br>investigating the long<br>uh the the impacts of covert over the<br>longer term and of course the biggest<br>area of government investment in the<br>country is the health sector<br>and so we have a panel now which<br>examines some of the issues that have<br>been challenging the health sector and<br>it's been buffeted by<br>a number of uh of trends firstly<br>obviously covert itself<br>and the challenge of preparing and and<br>coping with such a large public health<br>emergency<br>then of course you have the effect of<br>the<br>delay in a whole lot of normal health<br>activity and by that i mean electives<br>diagnostics operations all those things<br>which<br>were normally uh would be taking place<br>while the uh health sector has been in<br>this state of uh emergency if you like<br>the third area that's being buffeted is<br>of course the borders where the health<br>workforce a lot of which comes from<br>overseas has been uh buffeted has been<br>unable to come into the country uh and<br>that has created some supply challenges<br>there and then in the fourth uh<br>if you like of the of the four horses of<br>the challenge to the health sector is uh<br>is the reforms that the government is uh<br>is seeking to introduce and we'll be<br>introducing later this year uh the<br>large-scale uh operational reforms of<br>the health sector uh that are taking<br>place at this time during this pandemic<br>to discuss all these this morning with<br>me i have three excellent speakers<br>firstly we have professor robin gould<br>who's the dean and pro vice chancellor<br>of the otago business school and has a<br>lot of experience in health economics<br>we're about to be joined by des gorman<br>uh the emeritus professor of medicine at<br>the university of auckland uh very long<br>and distinguished career in the health<br>sector<br>including areas like workforce and acc<br>and ranjana patel who's the co-founder<br>and director of tamaki health now you<br>may not have heard of tamaki health but<br>it is the<br>largest independent<br>primary care<br>primary clear set of clinics in the<br>country uh 300 000 patients particularly<br>uh prominent in south auckland in the<br>auckland dismiss so that's our panel we<br>have a total of 45 minutes we're going<br>to put the pressure on the panels get<br>the talk for 5 to 10 minutes lay out<br>their stall if you like and then we're<br>going to have the conversation after<br>that so please get your questions ready<br>the first panelist joining us is<br>professor robin gould uh robin thank you<br>very much for joining us<br>and uh appreciate your your opening<br>comments<br>thank you very very much uh stephen for<br>your introduction and i just want to say<br>it's a real privilege to be here at the<br>nc economic forum and to be an invited<br>panelist<br>it's a really really impressive event<br>you've put together so congratulations<br>to the waikato management school for<br>for what you've achieved and bringing us<br>together today and in very challenging<br>circumstances<br>um<br>so just just uh to overview what i was<br>going to talk about in the next couple<br>of minutes or so a little bit of history<br>and<br>then a few words about the health nz<br>reforms themselves which as stephen has<br>said<br>are imminent<br>and then some really really important<br>questions<br>that are yet to be uh broached in terms<br>of those reforms which will have in my<br>view a very real impact on the way in<br>which they are implemented<br>and on whether the government is able to<br>achieve the goals that have set down for<br>those reforms<br>uh underpinning of this of course is an<br>institutional perspective and by<br>institutions those are the underlying<br>arrangements<br>and mechanisms<br>which sit<br>within the healthcare system in this<br>country and in any healthcare system<br>globally<br>so if we just roll the clock back to<br>1938<br>to the social security act which was<br>passed uh by the first labor government<br>with the goal of health care<br>of<br>health being a fundamental right with<br>all having equal<br>access to health care and the same<br>standard of treatment regardless of<br>socioeconomic status or of location<br>around the country<br>services being university available<br>no access barriers such as financial<br>barriers<br>a preventive rather than curative focus<br>on the health care system and then<br>services being integrated not fragmented<br>between primary and hospital-based care<br>great goals and we think today about<br>healthcare these are the sorts of goals<br>that governments right around the world<br>uh focusing on<br>so quite visionary but what we then had<br>was a period through which the british<br>medical association new zealand branch<br>which evolved into the new zealand<br>medical association<br>um really stood up and resisted uh this<br>this legislation albeit uh having been<br>passed through parliament<br>uh and what what they argued was that um<br>uh there needed to be uh<br>an ability to maintain private practice<br>to charge patients a fee for service<br>and so forth and so<br>over a period of a couple of years a<br>compromise was reached between the<br>government and the medical profession<br>and that laid down the institutional<br>arrangements that we have in place today<br>primary care<br>certainly up until very recently being<br>dominated by private<br>practice<br>and<br>secondary care and ability for the<br>specialists who would be paid on on<br>salary along with all other hospital<br>staff<br>uh able to take up a private practice as<br>well and so those are the arrangements<br>we have in place today of<br>dual practice as it's called globally in<br>the secondary care sector and then a<br>sort of a privately dominated certainly<br>historically but less so recently<br>in primary care<br>and so this has led to uh what you might<br>call quite compartmentalized healthcare<br>system when you think about these<br>different institutional arrangements<br>that sit across the sector and then<br>quite a lot of very intractable<br>questions which governments over the<br>years have sought to solve<br>and that has led to<br>what i call patriarchy<br>which has been an inability of<br>governments to dig into these underlying<br>institutional arrangements and then<br>instead try and sort of paste on top of<br>those arrangements different operational<br>uh structures and so the most recent<br>version of that is the health nz reforms<br>so if there's one thing you take away<br>today it's pastry it's pasting of policy<br>solutions on top of underlying<br>institutions<br>and so um on to the health nz reforms<br>um<br>i i i in my view um one needs to take a<br>really really long term view of these<br>reforms as one needs to take with any<br>set of reforms certainly in the<br>healthcare sector which arguably<br>is one of the most complex components of<br>public policy and of government<br>in any country and so one needs to take<br>a very very long term<br>view especially when you have fairly<br>rigid<br>institutional arrangements that underlay<br>the reforms that are being set and<br>trained<br>the<br>key challenges with the reforms and and<br>the reforms themselves what we're going<br>to see of course is uh the district<br>health boards being absorbed into<br>health new zealand as a as a preliminary<br>arrangement as they start to move into<br>the um<br>actioning of the reforms the maori<br>health authority will come into play the<br>primary health organizations will<br>effectively become defunct but continue<br>to function in some shape or form as<br>they seek to evolve into becoming what's<br>known as locality networks and so these<br>are<br>what you might call horizontally<br>integrated<br>groups where you would have say general<br>practices and in other primary health<br>care services uh integrated with various<br>social services there's nothing much new<br>in this governments over at least the<br>last 20 years plus have been seeking to<br>get this sort of horizontal integration<br>happening between social services and<br>health services<br>but<br>so integration is a good thing and the<br>government's quite focused on<br>integration but if you look closely at<br>the health nz reforms and the various<br>presentations being given by the health<br>reforms unit<br>uh there is a quite there is a<br>separation between health and zed<br>funding the public hospitals the former<br>district health boards<br>and then funding the locality networks<br>the primary care and so in my view<br>what's really needed is a mechanism for<br>vertical integration so that's<br>integration between the primary and the<br>hospital<br>sector and i don't see<br>much prospect for that happening<br>certainly in the short term and that's<br>because of the<br>funding pathway<br>leading to a separation of the two<br>in my view what's um really needed is um<br>to take the funding out of the hospitals<br>and to take the funding out of primary<br>care out of the locality networks as<br>such and put it somewhere in between and<br>so that there is a requirement for the<br>two parts of the sector to actually work<br>actively and collaboratively together in<br>order to<br>access the important funding and this of<br>course<br>would<br>give way to the really important<br>clinically led conversations that need<br>to happen between the hospital<br>specialists and other hospital-based<br>staff and the primary care<br>practitioners general practice<br>practitioners and other primary care<br>workers<br>because once you have those sorts of<br>conversations happening and the funding<br>sits there as well around the table then<br>you have the capacity to really shift<br>services between the sectors and again<br>there's nothing new in this and<br>the prior government and this government<br>have both been focused on these sorts of<br>questions but i think the reform is<br>going to work against them certainly in<br>the short term<br>now if you're able to um have those<br>kinds of conversations you can get<br>services such as for example colonoscopy<br>which is currently<br>requiring a physics to a hospital clinic<br>uh the<br>procedure is performed by a<br>gastroenterologist<br>if you look around the world<br>you will find that these procedures are<br>performed by nurses with technical<br>skills freeing up the gas program and<br>out in the community not in a hospital<br>freeing up the gastroenterologist's time<br>to do high-level specialist work<br>so<br>there's a need to really rethink about<br>the gap between the primary and the<br>secondary and how we're going to resolve<br>that and then the second point uh i want<br>to make uh just to sort of close up is<br>that the reforms are really focused on<br>equity this sits at the heart of what<br>the government has been talking about<br>seeking to solve<br>the long-standing<br>uh issues to do with equity around<br>healthcare access and healthcare<br>outcomes in this country<br>and i think there's a fundamental<br>problem which the reforms are not<br>uh confronting<br>uh and that is the public private<br>uh divide in terms of health care is<br>delivered in this country and again this<br>is not uncommon globally every<br>healthcare system in the world has<br>a component of public and of private but<br>it's how you manage the two sectors<br>which is really critical to<br>trying to resolve the equity issue and<br>we all know that<br>those who have insurance which is<br>expensive<br>or who are lucky enough to have an<br>employer who provides an insurance um<br>and that's not common<br>or who have deep pockets can simply pay<br>to get for example gallstones uh done<br>privately next week whereas in the<br>public sector uh getting gallstones done<br>you're really way way down the bottom of<br>the list and you're likely to be<br>prescribed morphine and think back to<br>work<br>um until you have an acute episode and<br>are treated on a sunday morning at 2am<br>and so you know resolving these problems<br>is is just not um achievable within the<br>current arrangements and um and i don't<br>think the govern government's going to<br>be able to deliver on its goals uh<br>within the current arrangements and so<br>to me<br>uh and i've thought quite a bit about<br>this and there is no perfect funding<br>arrangement anywhere in the world<br>uh to me we need to start having a<br>conversation around social insurance for<br>health care in this country<br>now if you go to countries with social<br>insurance in germany as the prime<br>example but you'll find it in japan<br>korea taiwan and various other parts of<br>the world as well<br>what's important about social insurance<br>is that<br>equity is a key focus<br>in solidarity and so<br>uh you will find that um regardless of<br>who you are what your income status is<br>or where you live uh you can make a<br>choice public or private and the<br>providers all work off the social<br>insurance fund and so it would mean that<br>the underlying<br>institutional arrangements public and<br>private sector which politically uh are<br>deeply difficult to to try and broach uh<br>would not need to be<br>um<br>dug into any deeper because the social<br>insurance would simply become the funder<br>agnostic of provider<br>um<br>so uh<br>that's that's probably some comments to<br>open up with and uh look forward to<br>further discussion thank you<br>thanks robin that's great<br>uh and thank you for for your<br>comprehensive suggestions too throwing<br>the social insurance on the table so<br>early in the session i'm very impressed<br>with that uh now uh we do have a late<br>apology unfortunately uh des<br>we've just heard has been called a way<br>to deal with urgently with a patient<br>matter<br>which of course does happen to our<br>medical professionals and we have to<br>obviously respect that<br>so<br>i'm aware a bit of some of dez's<br>feedback on the topic so perhaps i'll<br>introduce that afterwards briefly<br>but of course we accept his apology and<br>hope everything goes well there and uh<br>we move on immediately to<br>the uh the primary care end of the<br>spectrum and ranjana patel thank you<br>very much for joining us uh this morning<br>and ranjana as i said uh lee is<br>co-founder and director of tamaki health<br>and uh<br>has a range of perspectives not just on<br>the current health reforms but also<br>what's going right and what's going<br>as i'm speaking at a economic forum i<br>need to put a qualifier in i am not<br>qualified in economics in any way<br>i'm not a doctor but have been at the<br>coalface of general practice since 1977<br>starting in otara<br>i am now retired from the business and i<br>work in working in the community with<br>police creating a different model for<br>family home in new zealand our biggest<br>shame<br>as you can imagine 45 years being in the<br>most vulnerable community my views on<br>recovery and reinvigoration are many and<br>thank you robin you have covered off the<br>health forum very adequately<br>of my views colonoscopy will be decided<br>back<br>um<br>must be 10 11 years ago building a whole<br>medical center in otara to cope with<br>secondary care but the funding just<br>couldn't move from secondary to primary<br>so<br>it's deja vu for me these health reforms<br>we've been there done that hasn't worked<br>but as we have limited time today<br>i will talk on the challenges we've<br>faced and covered and perhaps a few<br>views on recovery<br>workforce has been our biggest issue we<br>have over 1100 staff and over the past<br>two years they have lived up to our<br>values and their profession of here to<br>serve<br>but they are exhausted and they are<br>tired of being scared<br>covet is here to stay let's just get on<br>with the work<br>our pipeline of overseas doctors has<br>completely shut down<br>as a<br>and with the vulnerability of our aging<br>workforce our able staff had have had to<br>step up to cover<br>but there are 47 doctors i know of that<br>have passed the nzrx exam part one and<br>are unable to get placements in<br>hospitals or in general practice<br>to get their registration<br>and general practice isn't allowed to<br>take them<br>when 42 of our doctors are overseas<br>trained and we don't have enough here we<br>need to create a pathways for the ones<br>already sitting in new zealand to help<br>with our health care system<br>a bit of background on this my husband<br>arrived in new zealand in 1974 from<br>india and no one would give him a<br>pathway to registrations hospitals would<br>say get your registration we'll give you<br>a job and medical council will say get a<br>job and we'll give you registration<br>it took six months for someone to sit<br>say sit this american ecfmg exam and<br>we'll give you your registration<br>at least he had a pathway<br>but we don't have a pathway in 2022.<br>since the mid-80s immigration changed<br>their laws<br>and we have a lot of overseas doctors<br>and nurses coming into new zealand that<br>are not registered in new zealand<br>majority because especially nurses from<br>the islands cannot pass the english exam<br>which my nurse leader on several<br>occasions said she would have trouble<br>passing<br>these people we've employed they are the<br>unemployable<br>because they are not doctors they are<br>not nurses they are not project managers<br>but we employ them to be our diabetes<br>educators recalling and talking to<br>patients about preventative health they<br>have come from an environment when they<br>have done outreach clinics and remote<br>areas with diagnostic with little<br>diagnostic support they have delivered<br>babies they have done diabetes education<br>they have done immunization they've done<br>minor surgery<br>so even though they are only using a<br>fraction of their knowledge they got to<br>know the new zealand health system by<br>building their confidence<br>and then shadowing doctors many have got<br>their registrations to being nurses and<br>doctors<br>another example is a tongan health<br>practitioner<br>that we<br>employed she could not get recognized as<br>a doctor or a nurse because she didn't<br>fit into any category<br>she could just not move forward<br>she has worked with us for 20 years as<br>clinical family navigator visiting homes<br>education page educating patients on<br>self-management has put three children<br>through private schools through<br>scholarships and seeing them graduate at<br>university we need to see people's<br>strengths<br>not what they are not<br>that's how you provide equity<br>my second point is the mode of delivery<br>we need to be patient-centric not<br>wellington-centric and not pc centric if<br>we want to make a difference<br>we started in otara and we realized nine<br>to five appointment-based service wasn't<br>going to work and wasn't going to pay<br>our mortgage<br>it was the population that we were<br>serving<br>we needed to increase access time-wise<br>and financially<br>in those days phones and cars were<br>luxury in otara so we made it welcomed<br>and opened longer hours<br>totally against our profession must be a<br>dodgy indian couple<br>and then we introduced computers in 1984<br>so patients could go anywhere and their<br>notes would be there<br>patients own their notes not the doctors<br>patient centric majority of our clinics<br>across auckland are on one database<br>we need to let primary care come up with<br>what works for their patients it doesn't<br>fit into one box if telehealth works and<br>it did during covert let's see if we can<br>extrapolate that to do self-management<br>preventative health<br>and mental health<br>we we have to look at what mode works<br>for today and for your population and<br>not be suspicious of a different way of<br>working<br>regarding increasing access to<br>healthcare for maori and pacific while<br>we applaud the good work that pacific<br>for pacific and maori for maori general<br>praxis do do for the far now it needs to<br>be acknowledged that the majority of the<br>pacifica and maori are actually enrolled<br>in what is deemed to be mainstream<br>general practice<br>for example our practices in auckland<br>have 80 000 pacific patients enrolled<br>53 000 of those are in county's medical<br>practices making us the largest provider<br>of pacific and south auckland<br>however<br>deemed being mainstream and not at<br>pacific providers means the practices<br>serving them don't have any additional<br>resources offered to pacific providers<br>yet our patients don't attend anywhere<br>else as the practice endeavours to lower<br>all barriers such as cost extended hours<br>and placement of the practice within a<br>high needs communities<br>we have four generations coming through<br>our doors<br>this highlights their inequity in<br>equality and the distribution of the<br>health dollar the dollar has to follow<br>the patience not who you are and what<br>you are in primary health care<br>covert has highlighted we are the poor<br>cousins in healthcare general practice<br>the trust and confidence and gps from<br>patients has been broken over the two<br>years we are just the ambulance at the<br>bottom of the cliff<br>history showed gps could manage<br>outbreaks by getting their patients<br>vaccinated and seen<br>the first point of contact was taken<br>away from the patients we look after 80<br>percent of health care needs and get<br>less than 20 percent of the health care<br>budget<br>if we do not address this issue we will<br>be filling the hospitals very quickly<br>our chronic disease patients diabetes<br>obesity cancers are all going unchecked<br>we have to remove the scare tactics in<br>the community and start to empower<br>people to look after their health<br>conditions<br>prevention is better than cure<br>we have seen a big difference in the new<br>way of managing chronic disease with<br>health coaches peer supports<br>self-management and getting off the<br>couch working with people over 200 kvs<br>doctors cannot do everything but they<br>know what works for their patients and<br>need to be able to let the other<br>professionals and community workers do a<br>lot more of the educating<br>mental health will be a big issue we've<br>seen that in the household family harm<br>has increased so much<br>um patients presenting with unknown<br>symptoms are quite<br>have underlying issues with mental<br>health and we're just not dealing with<br>it<br>our in-house psychiatrist david says<br>what's been seen in the homes during<br>lockdown is going to take three<br>generations to be stamped out of<br>people's head we do what we see not what<br>we're told it would be a miss of me not<br>to highlight the issue general practice<br>has faced over the past two years<br>and yesterday it was really<br>revealed by the mp<br>it just announced<br>on tv that gps can do direct tests from<br>tomorrow it took all of us by surprise<br>my ce had to act quickly as people<br>started to demand the rectes<br>i message<br>stefan said i message ashley letting him<br>know that we received only enough for<br>testing staff for one exposure event<br>each and we would have to make an<br>announcement due to the high volume of<br>cause demands from patients<br>rapid tests<br>are not publicly available we had to put<br>this on our website we have had a very<br>high number of requests for these tests<br>from our patients however although they<br>are on order from the ministry of health<br>supply none of our clinics have been<br>provided their necessary allocations for<br>general public supply or use we regret<br>we have no visibility of insuff<br>sufficient supply of rats will be made<br>available to us<br>now this is not serving our patients<br>this is not patient strength centric<br>we had this happen with testing we had<br>this happen with vaccines and once again<br>the poor cousins are the ambulance at<br>the bottom of the cliff<br>thank you for listening to me<br>thank you very much ranjana um and<br>sadly the story that you've just relayed<br>about rat tests uh<br>um unfortunately is does appear to have<br>been symptomatic of some of the things<br>through the pandemic between the<br>ministry<br>and and the providers i suppose and and<br>the people that are with the<br>uh are looking after the patients<br>i want to cover three things in the time<br>remaining if i can and we'll start<br>perhaps with that mode of delivery or<br>point of delivery<br>and<br>and then i wanted to go into the reforms<br>and finally a little bit of workforce<br>and perhaps a comment from each of you<br>on on those three things<br>if we start with motive delivery<br>and i think we're probably hearing<br>symptoms of<br>this issue with<br>with funding and that inability to to<br>move easily funding between different<br>modes of delivery<br>experienced their first hand with rajna<br>and the team at tamaki health<br>and you picked that up with this whole<br>issue of<br>of<br>of hospital funding or private funding<br>and i think it's fair to say the dhb<br>model has definitely meant that it's<br>much more hospital-centric<br>than probably because that's where all<br>the risk is right running a hospital is<br>expensive<br>but that doesn't solve it from a patient<br>perspective so<br>i suppose my question to you is<br>how can we make it work better i do you<br>agree with wrenching that the<br>the funding actually has to follow the<br>patient where the patient wants to be is<br>where the funding should be<br>no i do and um uh<br>you know this is this is actually a<br>critical component of<br>research and policy and how health<br>policy globally now<br>uh is<br>the patient perspective and um<br>you can<br>bring real power to conversations around<br>health systems through bringing in the<br>patient voice we've had<br>quite a long history of<br>trying to work in this way in new<br>zealand but i don't think that we've<br>been able to articulate it as strongly<br>as it could have been or brought the<br>patient voice into the health system<br>and policy discussions<br>in ways in which we should have done<br>um<br>and again if i come back to the social<br>insurance<br>and i don't want to sound like too much<br>of a loud drum but uh with social<br>insurance i mean a patient decides<br>whether they want to go to the private<br>hospital or the public one or a general<br>practitioner you know you can still have<br>gatekeeping with a gp<br>but it actually gives the patient quite<br>a lot of choice within that context and<br>you think about acc which is for one of<br>a better term a form of social insurance<br>will be just covering accidents and<br>injuries so<br>um you know that funding model would<br>give a bit more power to the patient<br>voice<br>i think um so now i completely agree<br>it's absolutely important we haven't<br>and<br>you there's almost two parts to that<br>isn't there there's the funding itself<br>and then there's how you fund it so the<br>insurance part is how you fund it uh<br>then the equity part is the part that<br>runs has been talking about<br>running now do you see anything of these<br>current reforms that will make it easier<br>for tamaki health to do its job for its<br>300 000 patients compared to now at this<br>point<br>um<br>no we've been through localities um<br>you know 18 years ago didn't work um<br>the<br>assuming<br>all indians want to go to indian doctors<br>all pacific want to go to pacific<br>doctors is<br>very limited in its thought we don't<br>have enough doctors and nurses to cover<br>every ethnicity in new zealand<br>we do need to look at i like your social<br>insurance<br>it is so important<br>that everybody is able to<br>have<br>um service as you say with<br>any kind of hip operation or um<br>if you go to private you can go do it<br>next week if you go to public you're not<br>that bad you can wait six weeks<br>we saw over<br>covert that our platform better worked<br>very well with patients<br>but it worked patients in rural areas<br>where they couldn't get to gps<br>and because we made children free a lot<br>of parents were ringing to use that<br>service for children so that they could<br>get health care a funding model doesn't<br>allow any creativity and so over covered<br>we set up this better platform but we<br>couldn't charge the patients um and<br>because we've never ever made patients<br>um<br>not<br>to be seen even if they have large<br>accounts it's always been my husband and<br>my philosophy um that everybody deserves<br>health care um if you have patient<br>loyalty and as i said fourth generations<br>of people coming through us<br>to us is patient loyalty um it's<br>important we do the best for them<br>when we're seen<br>to be<br>ineffectual like this rats testing um no<br>one believes that no the prime minister<br>said you can have a vaccine but we don't<br>have vaccines you can have a rat test no<br>but we don't have rats yes our<br>credibility as primary care has really<br>deteriorated with our patients<br>our trust and confidence saying well you<br>know someone's telling us you can<br>um and you can't really so if we just<br>allowed more people to be able to<br>deliver different types of health<br>service to what is needed<br>self-management peer support is<br>invaluable to a lot of our patients<br>deterring from house a little bit um you<br>know when we talk about mode of delivery<br>i've started a family home project with<br>the help of partnering with police<br>where you look at the perpetrators<br>and you reform<br>the perpetrators because they are 95 of<br>the offenders now if you don't change<br>the core problem or address the core<br>problem our family harm statistics are<br>going to stay the same and i i was<br>criticized for working with the scum of<br>the earth the perpetrators but majority<br>of the women take the men back and we're<br>giving them no tools to deal with the<br>next episode so<br>messy research has been done on our<br>program was 60 percent over a five-year<br>period did not reoffend again<br>internationally unheard of in family<br>harm projects but it's still seen as<br>something suspicious<br>i started it for indian men and now it's<br>majority pacific and maori and so if you<br>do it with patient-centric it works for<br>everyone and i think the motor delivery<br>has to focus on being patient-centric<br>what will benefit the new zealand health<br>system if we work with the core need of<br>the patients<br>so what i'm hearing from miranda and<br>robin and you can both correct me if i'm<br>wrong as you're not convinced and des<br>was the same by the way in the notes<br>that he and i discussed ahead of time<br>that the health reforms are many ways<br>just rearranging the bureaucracy<br>to put it<br>perhaps less and charitably i mean that<br>people work hard but nevertheless um the<br>rearranging of the bureaucracy until we<br>get to a much more patient centered<br>money follows the patient and their<br>needs then we're not really going to<br>change things too much<br>okay i'll take that as as we're at<br>because i want to move on to one further<br>thing and that is the workforce<br>challenges and we've had a couple of<br>questions here<br>uh we've got our own uh we've had got<br>our own nurses and doctors still leaving<br>the country people want to know why that<br>is when we're bringing in 40 odd percent<br>of our doctors and nurses from offshore<br>and they also want to know<br>with two years of the borders closed how<br>big is the whole how i mean how<br>desperately are we in<br>in regards to the health workforce<br>and and are we going to be able to solve<br>it using our normal training methods so<br>perhaps if i go with you robin first and<br>then ranger we've only got a few minutes<br>but a quick comment from each<br>yeah look thanks this is a really<br>important question i'm of course not at<br>the front line but we historically have<br>been the<br>uh highest importer<br>in terms of total doctor percentage<br>of foreign-born and trained doctors in<br>the oecd 45-46<br>of our doctors uh one one in four<br>doctors uh from the uk<br>uh and nurses is not far behind uh and<br>it's a revolving door they<br>uh<br>about half of those doctors will only<br>stay here two years and then and this is<br>pre-covered and then go back overseas<br>again they might go they might come here<br>and then go to australia or go back to<br>the uk or wherever they've come from so<br>it's really it's a historic very<br>pressing and very real<br>problem um<br>part of it's to do with the training i<br>think we have been increasing the number<br>of certainly medical trainees and nurse<br>trainees and other professions<br>but part of it also i think uh relates<br>to scope of practice the point i was<br>making about gastroenterologists<br>undertaking colonoscopies and if if we<br>were able to have and i know that des<br>has been very involved in these<br>conversations with health workforce nz<br>they're really challenging because of<br>the<br>the strong strong protection of<br>interests within for example the medical<br>colleges so as i said elsewhere in the<br>world nurses are trained<br>to work under the supervision of a<br>gastroenterologist to do the procedures<br>so they can spend all day doing the<br>procedures and free up the<br>gastroenterologist to do other work but<br>there's a private component to this as<br>well<br>and i'm not going to make accusations<br>you can have your own thoughts about<br>this people here today<br>but private gastroenterologists um you<br>know do a lot of work privately so there<br>are really important conversations to be<br>had around all of this again and this is<br>why i come back to the social insurance<br>concept because it's agnostic of where<br>you provide the service<br>you know the funder has a fee schedule<br>and a method for sort of funding the<br>different services so you don't have to<br>dig into these<br>really difficult questions but i think<br>the scope of practice one's a really<br>important one<br>thanks ranjana um two things then one is<br>the<br>how big a problem are we dealing with<br>right now what's you know on the front<br>line what's the shortage like are we<br>likely to recover from it in the next<br>year or two and then secondly the scope<br>of practice question should we for<br>example be letting practice nurses do<br>more should we be letting<br>radiographers do more for example<br>rather than relying always on those<br>relatively small number of specialists<br>at the top of the system<br>from a general practice point of view<br>first of all the workforce we are at<br>critical stages we have the added<br>problem of people going back<br>home to uk and australia our doctors<br>especially our 24<br>7 centers we run two in auckland<br>um our local doctors don't want to work<br>the evening shifts or night shifts and<br>so it's usually the overseas doctors<br>that are manning them um uk and<br>australia you're right robert most of<br>them do go back the money's a lot better<br>over there<br>the 47 doctors i'm talking about are all<br>estimate doctors that would be<br>wanting to stay in new zealand and yet<br>we're not letting them um<br>the nurses uh we have the added problems<br>of the nurses being attracted to the dhb<br>on much higher pay scale than general<br>practice can offer<br>and so we've lost quite a few nurses<br>two hospitals who have come back again<br>you earn more being a vaccinator for the<br>dhb than you do in general practice so<br>yes<br>economics has paid such a big part to<br>the doctors and nurses moving and job<br>security and longevity<br>scope of practice you know<br>yes it's such a<br>limiting thing in patch protective<br>protection for the medical council and<br>the nursing council that they do not<br>recognize anybody's capability of doing<br>it and we<br>as general practice see the benefit and<br>peer support and self management from<br>people that have lived of the disease<br>and mental health people that have gone<br>through it are a much more able to<br>communicate with people that are<br>suffering from it um and so the scope of<br>practice it<br>limits so much of what the professionals<br>can do what lay people can build up to<br>do<br>and so we need pathways of doing it we<br>don't have enough doctors in new zealand<br>that are going to qualify um<br>and everyone's ambitious the kiwi way is<br>to have two three years overseas and<br>that's going to happen even though we've<br>got more doctors in the system at the<br>moment most of them will be going<br>overseas for their oe and so you know<br>we're in the same dire situation that<br>either we increase it dramatically<br>and allow overseas doctors in from<br>accredited universities um that can get<br>registration a pathway into general<br>practice because the hospitals can't<br>cope with them um these 47 doctors need<br>to get hospital space and no one's<br>giving them jobs in hospitals so the<br>scope of practice and<br>who's in the<br>who's doing what is so important and let<br>general practice decide who does what um<br>you know the<br>college can say<br>um<br>scope of practices we just you know i<br>can't put this on the government this is<br>the governing bodies of the different<br>institutions that are limiting what is<br>able to be done in new zealand<br>it feels like scope of practice needs<br>looking at it feels like the method of<br>training needs looking at<br>i'll throw a plug-in for the host<br>university here<br>they're pretty keen on a third medical<br>school i know in your neck of the woods<br>robin they probably wouldn't be quite so<br>keen but you know<br>it's something that it feels like it's<br>time has come i mean we need to get on<br>not necessarily the same as the other<br>two medical schools but uh perhaps one<br>focus particularly on general practice<br>or something like that which just<br>provides those opportunities greater<br>opportunities for people domestically to<br>increase the supply<br>but also<br>we're going to have to be working pretty<br>hard to bring people in because i<br>imagine we're in a very competitive<br>world at the moment<br>for doctors and nurses uh of all<br>specialties and generalities look can i<br>thank you both very much for your time<br>this morning and also stepping up in in<br>dez's absence i think you've represented<br>uh very similar views to what uh des<br>would have offered in terms of the<br>in terms of the views on the reforms i<br>think hopefully there's something there<br>for uh minister little to think about uh<br>there'll be it'd be a terrible travesty<br>if we do all this reform and we end up<br>having the same conversations in three<br>years time which and sadly it looks<br>possible at least at this point so thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
