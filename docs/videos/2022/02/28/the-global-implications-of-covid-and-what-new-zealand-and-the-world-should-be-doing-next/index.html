back to the other side of the<br>studio and we're very happy now for this<br>next session to be welcoming the right<br>honourable helen clark<br>now of course we know<br>helen is our former prime minister of<br>new zealand but also has led the massive<br>united nations development program and<br>more recently has co-chaired the<br>independent panel on pandemic<br>preparedness and response so given these<br>roles she has a unique perspective on<br>the theme of this conference dealing<br>with coverts long tail<br>kia ora helen welcome to the forum very<br>much looking forward to<br>hearing your views and of course for<br>those watching please do send in through<br>some questions and we'll have time for a<br>little q a with helen shortly kia ora<br>hiro matt and good morning everyone<br>i've mostly you know focused since<br>leaving for the un<br>all those years ago on<br>global issues but of course you know you<br>always keep an eye out for your own<br>country and how it's it's navigating<br>through those<br>uh sorry i haven't been able to join<br>earlier but my conference calls went to<br>4 30 a.m this morning so i didn't think<br>i'd be um<br>particularly on to advice attend on the<br>conference at 10 o'clock<br>but i thought i'd just you know make<br>some opening remarks and really invite<br>people to<br>come in and exchange<br>views<br>the topic i know is major opportunities<br>and challenges for new zealand you know<br>following<br>following covert and i wish we were<br>following covet and that's part of the<br>point of what i want to say we don't<br>seem to be able to get this this off our<br>back uh globally<br>and i i think<br>really complicating the whole scene is<br>we're not just dealing with covet we're<br>dealing with as a world a syndemic of<br>issues a whole lot of major issues<br>coming at us<br>simultaneously<br>this is without doubt the worst health<br>emergency<br>in a century<br>that's<br>you know in the lifetimes of almost<br>everyone living in new zealand my<br>father's about to celebrate his 100th<br>birthday he wasn't here for the great<br>flu epidemic<br>in 1918.<br>yes<br>aids<br>is described as a pandemic by unaids and<br>took a huge toll of lives but we haven't<br>seen anything like<br>this global impact of a pathogen uh<br>since uh 1918.<br>and we weren't ready for it which was<br>the<br>of course a key finding<br>of the independent panel for pandemic<br>preparedness and response which i<br>co-chaired and on which we built uh<br>recommendations to try to do better<br>when a future threat emerges because you<br>can't stop these uh kinds of events<br>arising a zoonotic spill overall<br>which is usually the cause<br>but you can stop them becoming a<br>pandemic and that's what the world<br>dismally fails to do<br>but then you you<br>put alongside this extraordinary<br>challenge<br>which has wrecked economies<br>challenged society shaken some to their<br>roots<br>the fact that we're living through an<br>era of the worst relations between the<br>major powers<br>since the cold war<br>ended<br>some<br>30-plus years ago<br>and a world where new zealanders is<br>pressured to take to take sides which<br>which threatens the rather careful uh<br>balancing act we have had particularly<br>with uh with respect to<br>china<br>uh and then we have the other you know<br>existential what what's happening to the<br>climate highly relevant to new zealand<br>with its you know enormous<br>agricultural and and horticultural base<br>and i retain<br>very close uh family farming connections<br>and in the south waikato area<br>the seasons are more unpredictable<br>uh the rain's unreliable when it comes<br>and comes and<br>amounts we can't deal with how many<br>times in the last year has westport been<br>told to evacuate i mean this is a crisis<br>and so not just for our rural<br>communities<br>and still very much the backbone of new<br>zealand but also because we've always<br>traditionally built around our river<br>mouths and coastlines and our<br>settlements threatened time and time<br>again so<br>these these are a huge set of risks put<br>together<br>something that doesn't impact so<br>directly on new zealand but the world is<br>facing its worst<br>forced displacement crises<br>uh<br>ever we could say since the end of the<br>second world war but at<br>over one percent of the world's<br>population is now forcibly displaced<br>from its home by war conflict repression<br>and and so on and that puts quite a<br>burden on the international humanitarian<br>system which it isn't isn't coping with<br>and of course the more<br>money that that has to be diverted to<br>that from playing ordinary mainstream<br>development the more you can't address<br>the underlying issues<br>so<br>we live in a pretty uh vaccine and<br>troubled<br>world<br>that leads me to say that uh<br>everyone is in the business of making<br>decisions which we all are from the<br>level of the individual uh family that<br>they buy and invest in<br>social policy developers the business<br>community our economists our political<br>decision makers we're all making<br>decisions in times of huge<br>volatility uncertainty and risk and this<br>is the new normal there's not going to<br>be any return to you know perhaps the<br>sort of cozy days of 2000 when we<br>worried about the the y2 whatever bug<br>in<br>our computer systems you know<br>these are<br>new times no return to the status quo<br>anti<br>and for<br>all countries including ours how you try<br>to build resilience and the strength to<br>ride through these kinds of events<br>minimize the the impact on<br>populations economy societies is really<br>a<br>critical issue<br>on covert i think you may have just had<br>a<br>session with health health people i see<br>the<br>reporting today that globally the cases<br>have been falling<br>for the last three weeks clearly we are<br>counter cyclical<br>because we<br>have breathless headlines every day<br>about the uh the growing numbers and<br>we're now at the point where i think<br>everyone in new zealand knows someone<br>who's had it which hasn't necessarily<br>been faced uh here in the past<br>uh<br>again know huge uncertainty about<br>predicting the path of this but<br>it is most likely to keep coming in<br>waves and surges<br>with the possibility<br>of<br>something worse than<br>omicron<br>coming along because we're giving<br>globally the virus the opportunities<br>to change<br>the way it behaves that's because we are<br>not on top of transmission<br>and while some have hailed on a crime<br>it's perhaps the the beginning<br>of the end maybe it may not be because<br>of this virus<br>continually<br>surprising us<br>the problem is that if you let<br>transmission run unhindered<br>because of<br>substantial unvaccinated populations in<br>the world all because<br>countries which in my opinion like the<br>united kingdom shouldn't have better you<br>remove all controls and and let it rip<br>to the point where your<br>very own monarch is<br>among those affected you are creating<br>opportunities for the virus south africa<br>i see is now<br>uh<br>reporting<br>more concern about the variant of obama<br>from<br>which is which is more<br>transmissible again<br>we're not on the current trends<br>expecting<br>much of africa to get anything like even<br>70<br>vaccination until 2024<br>this is two years away for a virus<br>running wild and as i said it's not just<br>africa<br>it's it's<br>myanmar it's afghanistan the failed<br>states where you can't<br>conceivably roll out a<br>vaccination program<br>and then this propensity in the northern<br>hemisphere to declare victory before the<br>the job is done look i understand people<br>are completely fed up and over this<br>virus i'm completely over as a global<br>citizen that traveled a lot i haven't<br>left the country since march 2020. i<br>mean of course it's imperial<br>we can't just get on with life but we're<br>going to have to<br>get on with life in different ways from<br>what we did before we may be over over<br>but it's not over us<br>and<br>with the work that that our panel did we<br>we charted the opportunities that<br>this outbreak had to to get away from<br>being a<br>fairly um<br>low<br>number event in the province of china to<br>become a global pandemic there were many<br>opportunities missed<br>the who was<br>underpowered to deal with the challenge<br>and it didn't have the degree of<br>cooperation it needed from the source<br>country not notwithstanding that you<br>know and the fact that there were lost<br>weeks and dealing with it in january<br>2020 i think february 2020 will also go<br>down the history books as the huge<br>missed opportunity because the world<br>despite<br>having a declaration of a public health<br>emergency of international concern from<br>the world health organization kind of<br>sat back thought oh well it'll be sars<br>and how wrong that was i had occasion in<br>recent months to dig out again<br>when the first press statement from the<br>health ministry here was about<br>a case of a covert in new zealand 28th<br>of february 2020 and the press statement<br>ended with words uh something like<br>this is not expected to lead to<br>widespread community transmission i mean<br>yeah we were out to lunch and much of<br>the world was out to lunch and<br>predicting what uh what this could do<br>and the rest is his history so we're<br>going to be troubled by by this uh for<br>some time um<br>still a very much<br>advocating for the recommendations of<br>our panel there are also other good<br>panels<br>from from g20 etcetera<br>which have good recommendations on the<br>table and we're working<br>to see if the un general assembly will<br>pick up the issue of a special session<br>and give momentum uh to the reforms that<br>are needed uh to try to stop something<br>was bad happening again but if it<br>happened again tomorrow that the world<br>will not be ready which is our guess<br>now it just perhaps to come to a few<br>words<br>on<br>the challenges<br>i mean<br>when we took the measures which<br>of the health and well-being of new<br>zealand<br>and new zealanders were absolutely<br>necessary it actually turned out in the<br>bigger picture<br>uh<br>to probably be<br>best economic responsible circumstances<br>because we have<br>not only had the lowest death rate per<br>capita in the oecd through the pandemic<br>uh we've also been about the fifth best<br>economic performer<br>and<br>again the primary sectors that played an<br>enormous part in bringing<br>new zealand through we we ended up<br>writing off international tourism<br>writing of international education<br>but<br>clearly the days are coming when we will<br>manage<br>uh some kind of rebuilding these sectors<br>but i think the challenge really is to<br>do it differently and always be looking<br>to<br>uh the value and<br>the productivity and the innovation in<br>these sectors<br>not just treating them as as commodities<br>where they have maximum numbers with a<br>with a low yield it's easy to say and<br>hard to do but i think that's where the<br>smart thinking has to be and right<br>across across the economy it's always a<br>challenge for the uh the primary sectors<br>as well we need a huge focus on on<br>innovation<br>i recall<br>launching a government strategy two<br>decades ago on growth by innovation you<br>probably issue<br>the same today we get we can never stop<br>innovating we're in a race to the future<br>and if we get off that treadmill others<br>pass us by<br>uh pretty fast we have had opportunities<br>to<br>have skilled and talented new zealanders<br>back here through the pandemic very<br>important to create the environment<br>where they feel that they can thrive<br>here<br>and otherwise<br>as<br>circumstances relax particularly in<br>australia<br>we run the risk of the<br>brain drain<br>again<br>uh one last point perhaps i'd make<br>before stopping is that<br>globally the pandemic has<br>been exacerbated by pre-existing<br>inequalities and marginalization between<br>countries and and within countries we're<br>not an exception to that this has<br>exposed our fractures<br>and i think the<br>smart minds need to very much be turned<br>to<br>how do we build social cohesion how do<br>we build an economy in society where<br>everyone really feels they do have a<br>state and we don't leave<br>people behind we have had opportunities<br>to move more new zealanders into work<br>because of the<br>the lack of immigrant<br>labor<br>can we make this a permanent feature<br>that the keys are doing more of the jobs<br>and we're consciously<br>rehabilitating those who've fallen too<br>fast through the cracks to rise<br>into the labor market before there are<br>opportunities here<br>to deal with some of our<br>longer standing issues<br>so<br>that's<br>probably all for me for an opening on on<br>the kind of reset that we need but this<br>issue of the global reset has been very<br>much on the minds of world of the night<br>and others the problem is that we never<br>quite get the clear<br>air for the reset because the pandemic<br>keeps coming at us and<br>offering us more surprises<br>and then as i say it's immensely<br>complicated now by the<br>the worsening relationships between the<br>western china and obviously<br>devastating uh developments in ukraine<br>and all of these issues have threats for<br>us as one kind of another whether it's<br>supply chain disruption market<br>disruption<br>and so on back to you matt<br>gotta thank you helen and there are a<br>few topics that i'm very keen to pick up<br>there both on the on the pandemic and<br>looking more broadly at the geopolitical<br>situation as i know you're<br>you're still<br>very well connected and in the thick of<br>things on on many levels there first the<br>panel that you co-chaired and you've<br>touched on some of these themes now<br>was highly critical about the missteps<br>in the early days also about inequities<br>in vaccination rates across the world<br>hearing you just now talk about<br>that critical period of february two<br>years ago<br>what do you think this sounds like a<br>systemic issue it's it's hard to see the<br>way forward<br>what do you think<br>has changed what have we learned that<br>could prepare us because you'd have to<br>say the money would be on not being<br>another 100 years before an event of<br>this size we've got more people we've<br>got different interactions with um<br>animals people are moving around the<br>world or all of those things what do you<br>think we've learned and what needs to<br>change<br>there's nothing to say that a zoonotic<br>spillover event can't happen tomorrow<br>next week you know i mean in a way we've<br>been lucky to dodge a bullet like this<br>for a century<br>you know<br>what if sars had come<br>to us<br>what have ebola<br>come to us but<br>but this pathogen respiratory pathogen<br>just just took off when it wasn't<br>contained at an early stage<br>now<br>what<br>what we said was this<br>china was not<br>transparent<br>and<br>jim mcclay peter gluckman<br>probably alex gillespie like he's on the<br>line for law school some very smart<br>minds in new zealand linked up offshore<br>with with what is needed<br>by by means of a new<br>set of legal arrangements around<br>pandemics<br>we<br>this will be hard because member states<br>you know will stand on the pinhead of<br>sovereignty you know you can't tell us<br>what to do<br>but<br>what the who needs is<br>when word of a pandemic threat emerges<br>it's got to get to the site<br>immediately<br>automatic access to visas and entry this<br>didn't happen<br>quite a while before the who actually<br>got to uh<br>also<br>there was not an official notification<br>from the government of china<br>the who<br>and its its networks<br>are scanning<br>the social media chatter the the<br>news networks globally<br>hour by hour minute by minute looking at<br>where there is news of of some<br>event<br>and<br>what was picked up from wuhan<br>at the very end of december 2019<br>uh was that the wuhan<br>health system<br>issued a communication to its hospitals<br>about<br>a a pneumonia of of unknown uh<br>provenance<br>that's what was picked up and that's<br>when the wh i think on the first of<br>january 2020 picked up the phone to<br>china you know radio science<br>there was not proper information they<br>couldn't get access<br>also under the international health<br>regulations they they couldn't publish<br>the information that they had without<br>the permission of the member state<br>states<br>they seem to feel very constrained by<br>the international health regulations<br>about taking a precautionary approach<br>and what our panel said was when a<br>respiratory pathogen with pandemic<br>potential is on the move<br>and there's a high likelihood of human<br>to human transmission which was denied<br>for a while<br>you need to act in a precautionary<br>fashion<br>now<br>the international health regulations<br>2005 were drawn up as a response to sars<br>the director general of the time grow<br>harlem brooklyn former norwegian prime<br>minister<br>says to us if i had had to operate then<br>under sars<br>under the international health<br>regulations you have today i couldn't<br>have done my job<br>that's pretty stunning isn't it those<br>regulations were supposed to be an<br>improvement actually they they tied the<br>who's hands even more and before<br>declaring a public health emergency of<br>international concern they have to take<br>so many boxes they have to convene an<br>emergency committee the emergency<br>committee is of experts from around the<br>world clearly some of these come from<br>states where experts are not<br>particularly free to run an independent<br>view the emergency committee when called<br>around the 22nd of june january refused<br>to recommend<br>that the international declaration be<br>issued so you lose another week while dr<br>tedros goes to china<br>to<br>persuade them<br>i need help here i need to declare this<br>emergency all of this is nonsense he<br>needs access to the site he needs to<br>publish whatever information he's got<br>he's got to be able to act in a<br>proportionary way and he should have the<br>authority of his own volition backed by<br>his internal expert processes to declare<br>a pandemic that's how we lost the first<br>month lack of cooperation and<br>underpowered wh but as i said february<br>uh when he issued the declaration<br>everyone sort of sat back and said oh<br>kind of interesting what's happening in<br>wuhan that that's when it it got away<br>so the big lesson i think to countries<br>like ours is when a declaration like<br>this is made you wake up fast now<br>to the extent that we did act and we put<br>the travel ban on china and then iran<br>and then eventually it became the rest<br>of the world for a long time that at<br>least we did that heaven knows what had<br>happened that the nine flights a day had<br>had kept coming into new zealand uh<br>right through february that would have<br>been disastrous but we need change to<br>the international health regulations we<br>probably need our panel recommended and<br>overarching new pandemic framework<br>treaty which sets out the obligations of<br>member states to notify to cooperate<br>with the who<br>that<br>isn't in practice at the moment<br>no and it sounds<br>incredibly challenging to to get the<br>change that from the outside looks so so<br>obviously needed i'm going to shift<br>gears a little bit but obviously the<br>pandemic affects every element of<br>society and geopolitics at the moment<br>this week<br>look at a tv screen at your news app<br>there's a shadow over europe<br>there's a lot of tension obviously<br>around ukraine<br>things are happening by the day by the<br>hour<br>but pull the pull the lens back a little<br>bit<br>and<br>from your time<br>and leadership at the un<br>from the longer perspective of the last<br>few decades there's a sense that the<br>global order is changing some of those<br>relationships between the superpowers<br>and in fact the power balances are<br>probably changing how do you see the<br>situation between some of the big<br>players at a geopolitical level evolving<br>over<br>not just<br>the next week or the next two<br>particularly around the ukraine but<br>those bigger forces<br>how do you see those evolving over the<br>well the ukraine<br>situation is catastrophic<br>i mean bold prediction as things move by<br>the day i'm not yet convinced<br>that president putin's<br>going to try a you know a sort of total<br>angelus rolling the tanks right through<br>ukraine to kiev<br>but<br>he's he's created the ground<br>um obviously with the annexation of of<br>crimea<br>eight years ago and the<br>he's in effect controlled those two<br>other two regions of ukraine since 2014<br>these separatists uh yeah<br>his people<br>the russian military have been in there<br>one way or another that is now explicit<br>so what he's doing is he's testing the<br>boundaries he's testing how much will<br>the west do if i do this and then you<br>know he's the sort of guy if you give<br>him an inch he takes a mile<br>one of the big issues i think is whether<br>in his definition of recognizing the<br>independence of these two state vets<br>which is very much what he did with<br>those breakaway areas of georgia<br>back in what 2009<br>south ossetia and kazia<br>um<br>he's<br>basically made them for all intensive<br>purposes part of a larger<br>soviet union and he's trying to now<br>formalize those borders but how big is<br>that border how much over that line of<br>control has been of the conflict<br>never a frozen conflict from the last<br>eight years a lot of people have died<br>how far over that line will go that's<br>what he's testing now some maps that<br>they are issuing are suggesting that the<br>port of mario poll is within the areas<br>that he's recognizing as<br>as part of these statelets and the port<br>of mario poll<br>is not currently under separatist<br>control so there's a battle from for<br>mario paul<br>this will be uh pretty pretty shattering<br>but i think his assessment has been that<br>currently the west is is weak and<br>divided he would have looked at the<br>afghanistan debacle he will look at uh<br>you know a world distracted by by covert<br>president biden you know as president<br>now always distracted by the major lack<br>of political cohesion and shared purpose<br>and<br>in the united<br>will look at the st<br>also somewhat distracted by china and<br>he'll think i'll buddy up with china and<br>you know<br>i can<br>you know start recreating uh the soviet<br>union the demise of which i said was the<br>greatest tragedy of the 20th century<br>that that's the mindset<br>uh so he'll just keep keep nibbling and<br>the us has got its<br>u.s and nato got their sort of<br>escalating sanctions but at the moment<br>they're a slap over the rest of the<br>world hankins i'm not going to deter him<br>you know at least going to the<br>formalization of the borders on the line<br>of control um i had a long conversation<br>with kevin rudd two or three weeks ago<br>and kevin had a very interesting phrase<br>about the challenge being how can we try<br>to return to some kind of managed<br>strategic competition<br>we know<br>there's you know all the difference in<br>the world between the political system<br>of new zealand and china<br>new zealand and russia the western china<br>western russia but does that have to be<br>the first roadblock every time we have<br>any kind of interaction well can we<br>sort of more pragmatically scope out<br>where we need to work together and where<br>we're going to continue to have have<br>differences can we try to manage this<br>better<br>actually we managed it better during the<br>cold war when you come to think of it<br>but we've never really found<br>found the balance since and then since<br>then china has been on the rise<br>russia's felt that it's been on the<br>on the decline and trying to<br>build itself up again<br>these are very challenging times what i<br>found really interesting was when there<br>was the special meeting of the security<br>council on ukraine<br>under russia's chairmanship because they<br>had the chair this this month they<br>didn't get support from a single member<br>not from any of the usual suspects not<br>from china<br>chinese foreign minister is making<br>statements about the sovereignty of<br>ukraine needing to be respected<br>so that they're kind of out on their own<br>there but i'm not sure that's any<br>concern to personal people<br>so<br>in the heat of this crisis it's hard to<br>see how you get to sort of manage<br>strategic competition with russia in its<br>present mood but could it be possible<br>with china because you need cooperation<br>at the greatest geopolitical level<br>to end the pandemic<br>to tackle the climate issues<br>to try to stop some of the intractable<br>conflicts all of which have proxy powers<br>standing behind them whether it's russia<br>china the gulf whatever<br>if if you just have a lack of<br>cooperation a lack of dialogue we can't<br>tackle any of these issues effectively<br>no no it's a as you said at the start<br>it's a troubled world<br>look i'm uh i'm going to wrap us up now<br>we could obviously talk for several<br>hours more although it sounds like<br>you're on you'll be soon on to your next<br>bank of of conference calls in to<br>different parts of the world helen thank<br>you for your time and thank you for your<br>perspective it's great uh to have the<br>chance to connect<br>and i i hope you i wish you well in your<br>continuing work um there's a lot on your</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
