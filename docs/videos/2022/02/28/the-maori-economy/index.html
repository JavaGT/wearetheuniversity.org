session on the maori<br>economy and in particular we're going to<br>be looking at dealing with<br>coverts long tail as matt mentioned i'm<br>a professor at the white cultural<br>management school and i wakapappa to my<br>tahumata friti on the east coast just<br>out of<br>wair so we hear glittering headlines<br>about the size of the maori economy<br>pre-pandemic in 2018<br>the asset base of the maori economy was<br>68.7 billion which is a phenomenal 60<br>growth since 2013.<br>but actually what's in a number that<br>number<br>68.7 billion tells a particular story<br>of an economy that is underpinned by<br>maori values an intergenerational<br>outlook<br>stakeholders in perpetuity<br>well-being as a perfect purpose and<br>profit as a means to an end<br>so amidst the surge of covert and the<br>long tail that we are all collectively<br>facing we have two expert economic<br>matakite so visionaries who are working<br>in the maori economy at the interface<br>between world views so it's a great<br>pleasure to welcome liz tiamour and<br>wayne tainoui<br>liz and wayne will speak for about five<br>minutes each on our session topic and<br>then we will open up to questions from<br>the audience i really encourage you to<br>put your questions through slido<br>so i'll briefly introduce each speaker<br>and then i'll hand over to you first liz<br>so wayne first you are very well known<br>to us here at the waikato management<br>school you've been on our business<br>advisory board<br>for a number of years now<br>and you've been a key contributor to our<br>amazing new strategy<br>wayne is pwc's manukaura maori business<br>leader responsible for developing and<br>leading the firm's strategy for the<br>maori sector and he has considerable<br>knowledge on the maori economy in new<br>zealand commercial landscape<br>angeles<br>as i recall we last met when you were<br>awarded a maori business leader award<br>for the incredible work that you were<br>doing as executive director at mb<br>responsible for leading the national<br>crown maori economic development<br>strategy in partnership<br>but you've been ceo at middlebury's in<br>tauranga since i think 2018 and it's one<br>of those businesses that puts maori<br>ideals into practice as a collective and<br>as the website says<br>combines ancient traditions and values<br>handed down by the ancestors with modern<br>technology in science so welcome liz<br>real privilege to be here today that was<br>a bit of a trip down memory memory lane<br>um<br>my background i spent about 16 years<br>with new zealand new zealand trade and<br>enterprise half of that offshore half<br>onshore so representing new zealand and<br>exporters in trade<br>um<br>10 years in the private sector and then<br>two years with mb as shelley said<br>working closely with ministers including<br>stephen joyce<br>uh on the maori economic development<br>strategy for the country<br>and so i'm very grateful for that career<br>and that perspective and that lens and<br>where that took me to was a place where<br>uh it was time for me to go home so<br>coming back to um where i papa to<br>in and around to poke where my whanau<br>was<br>and what i understood and knew was that<br>for maori<br>i wanted to go right from this<br>helicopter view of talking about the 70<br>billion dollar maori economy to actually<br>growing maori businesses because<br>that was going to be the job creator<br>that was going to change the lives of<br>our people um<br>in in our rural communities our rural<br>maori communities and so i joined uh<br>this little company called middle it<br>means barry and maori and um<br>as we try to wrangle a horticultural<br>start-up<br>an indigenous business model against<br>some very commercial drivers<br>that's the mission uh certainly i joined<br>for um<br>four years ago now and so at the heart<br>of metal uh what are we with 30<br>maori shareholders<br>um growing starting with blueberries<br>growing high-value crops we grow in a<br>hydroponic styled<br>growing system so that's tunnels it's a<br>substrate it's a fertigation system so<br>it's at the high tech end of growing<br>and our shareholders joined up with a<br>view to<br>understanding they had<br>investments in<br>farming and dairy and fish and forestry<br>and tourism they wanted to understand<br>what horticulture could offer them as<br>well that's why they joined but they<br>joined together<br>to be part of a maori collective one<br>that was very much underpinned by<br>tikanga<br>by our values of kotahitanga working<br>collectively kaitiakitanga<br>sustainability<br>mana kitanga<br>care of people in place so that was<br>critical to them when they joined up<br>they had aspirations of owning ip but<br>didn't necessarily know what that<br>might mean the investment required very<br>much horizon 3 activity and also<br>building a global maori brand one that<br>they could see themselves in but also it<br>had to resonate with global consumers<br>so that's the journey we've been on and<br>if i think about what we are today<br>over the last four years we now have<br>10 orchards just finished harvesting 11<br>orchards in our network we start with<br>ngati kuri right up in hohoro come down<br>to naitihura and in moronsville out to<br>matakana island for toronto moana<br>ngati pero and tolaga bay along with<br>hawaii incorporation wii pedi trust in<br>gisborne<br>biggest orchards in tateko<br>maihana koita trust<br>there<br>te ho atiho um in<br>so we're spread around the north island<br>in terms of our orchards<br>and what the the ambitious task we took<br>on was growing these varieties of<br>blueberries<br>in a system that was that were new to<br>new zealand in a system that was new to<br>new zealand<br>with all the other parts of the ambition<br>why<br>it's important because it took me from a<br>macro level right down to a very micro<br>level of what these communities and i'll<br>settle on to tickle because that's where<br>our biggest orchards are<br>what they look like uh the 10 people in<br>a household which we've all become a<br>little bit more familiar with over in<br>these covered times<br>uh the intergenerational nature the the<br>patients required the lack of capital<br>available to help maori land development<br>and so if they hold uh to ko papa dear<br>to their hearts in my shareholders it's<br>that we must grow over our own land we<br>must go over maori land so that means<br>most of the developments are leasehold<br>and that we are focused on jobs and<br>skills for our people and uh when we<br>started this we went in uh<br>this somewhat more closed economy of<br>covert where uh the horticulture<br>industry had access to rscs it had<br>access to a lot of backpackers and so we<br>started with this notion of<br>no we're here for our own we're going to<br>be you know above 90<br>local maori employed<br>and so if i think about that vision and<br>those challenges and how we've been<br>wrangling that<br>there's been many<br>uh challenges on the way<br>but where i go to i guess is uh in the<br>reserve bank governor this is adrian<br>moore's favorite little triangle<br>which he gave us is that triangle of uh<br>thinking about the key issues capital<br>capability and connectivity or<br>connection<br>uh so when you are just developing doing<br>developments over mighty leasehold land<br>that is very hard to sell at retail it's<br>very hard to sell to anyone but the<br>landowners<br>and their friends basically so um i know<br>uh reserve bank people are thinking<br>about how you might unlock<br>um<br>lending to maori land but that's a real<br>constraint about how we get the<br>potential of maori land moving second is<br>our capability and i see it both as a<br>an opportunity and a challenge<br>we need to invest probably two to three<br>times more effort in getting our own<br>local maori people who have never had<br>the opportunities of an education of<br>regular income uh three four generations<br>of um entrenched uh poverty in their<br>household so we're working in some of<br>the poorest communities in the country<br>how we lift them not only in confidence<br>and spirit and modi and waidua but but<br>in basic day-to-day uh capability of get<br>up go to work five days a week six days<br>a week and harvest and then the skills<br>to grow hydroponically workers teams uh<br>all of that and then the connectivity to<br>me is um a bit easier to talk about so<br>i'm just going to pick a couple of<br>things out that really are highlights<br>for us and i've come on to this call<br>because we're in a shareholder meeting<br>on a teams call at the moment um<br>is our two highlights this year is we<br>are building a maori brand and we've<br>just presented that to our shareholders<br>uh and they are related at<br>um how it's resonating with particularly<br>our asian consumers but how how it is<br>very much about us as maori and aotearoa<br>new zealand uh and the second thing<br>we're super proud of is we're now 50<br>hectares<br>of hydroponic growing and having created<br>uh well over 500 jobs<br>across the network uh while we built<br>these orchards so it lands us as a<br>collective now the largest grower of<br>substrate berries in new zealand<br>and i think i'll just stop there with<br>the<br>middle story and um<br>and hand over to you wayne<br>thanks liz yes wayne would you like to<br>so hello everyone my name's wayne um so<br>yeah i guess my experience in terms of<br>just growing and having experience the<br>modern economy is a little bit different<br>to us<br>so my<br>my uh journey has been you know the<br>upbringing from down to the grassroots<br>in terms of<br>so of nothing money budget descent<br>someone took a video to hong kong coffee<br>that type of thing is a boy but learning<br>in terms of our you know cultural<br>imperatives our te kang our tv or etc<br>uh and then uh you know got the<br>opportunity to study at the waco<br>management school uh and then uh went<br>into the corporate uh setting uh joined<br>pricewaterhousekeepers just over 20<br>years ago so<br>um probably give you some perspectives<br>in terms of working through you know<br>that pathway um quite different very<br>very<br>very kind of uh<br>non-naughty kind of environment if i can<br>express it that way so the challenge for<br>me personally was how do i balance you<br>know my values and my upbringing in a<br>corporate setting um and and<br>it'd be fair to say it's been<br>quite a journey from coming from what's<br>quite a conventional corporate kind of<br>setting to where we are today<br>uh so the group i have today just to<br>give you a sense of the journey that<br>we've had you know there's there's<br>there's 80 of us across this country in<br>our monaco group<br>and we've got uh approximately you know<br>six uh partners with uh modern heritage<br>within the corporate setting um quite a<br>journey from working with uh pre and<br>post settlement groups you know 10 years<br>ago when i came back from wolfshore uh<br>having worklets in the united kingdom in<br>australia<br>and seeing the transition and the<br>journey and the impact that's had for<br>obviously for maori and for um ayat in<br>terms of working through that process<br>and the issues and the challenges there<br>but the modern economy has always been<br>at the heart of it it's always been<br>about how do we unlock it<br>you know lots of literature and stories<br>and and love what liz just shared with<br>you in terms of ambition around you know<br>how we take this how we take this and<br>make it real in terms of productivity in<br>terms of opportunity for maori across<br>the landscape um what's been kind of<br>some of the key definingness for me<br>personally<br>one is around embedding a stronger<br>in organizations like this one and<br>corporate one and being able to use this<br>size and scale to work with maori<br>such as mero such as many organizations<br>evie hot water throughout the country uh<br>to support them to enable<br>their ambitions uh commercial<br>uh social<br>environmental uh or otherwise<br>and so some of the things that we've<br>been focused on as a group through our<br>experiences with our people on the<br>ground<br>uh have been you know a number of things<br>we um we've looked at uh manitriti uh<br>the<br>treaty of waitangi one of the things<br>that we did in terms of setting our<br>strategy is we built our railtacky our<br>strategy based on the principles of city<br>or waitangi and so one of the challenges<br>i guess today for uh both<br>mighty focused entities and non-maori<br>entities is what does a good treaty<br>partner look like<br>what does that mean<br>and how do you embrace that in terms of<br>the things you want to do with your<br>non-maori or maori and but you're still<br>making a contribution or you are working<br>in the remote economy to get the<br>outcomes that maori seek and obviously<br>you know what that means for ayatura at<br>large so it's a big one the other one is<br>equity just you know what's happening<br>and what do we need to do around some of<br>the challenges that are out there<br>inequity and they're pretty obvious when<br>you think about it in a social<br>perspective from health<br>that we've gotten the pandemic at the<br>moment and you know just uh just just<br>looking at vaccine rates um to you know<br>education to justice to to a range of<br>issues that are real for us as a people<br>in our households and amongst alpha now<br>um so you know technology um you know<br>what do we look like in the digital<br>space got some challenges there you know<br>we we need we need to see what solutions<br>and how we introduce those solutions<br>from a tower maori perspective as we<br>travel in the digital world that's quite<br>real<br>maybe one of the other areas that are<br>significant it's just around the whole<br>agribusiness<br>environment maori land owners the use of<br>maori land again reference point towards<br>the list with metal um and how we get<br>you know outcomes that are going to be<br>relevant for us in terms of the<br>utilization of mighty land and there are<br>many others what's happening with the<br>water reforms<br>for example<br>and<br>you know just just the kinds of things<br>that are going to be the catalyst for<br>change that is positive for us as maori<br>um the last one probably i'll share is<br>just around wealth management but what<br>do we need to do uh to enter into you<br>know a new chapter uh that's uh that's<br>gonna embed for us in terms of<br>intergenerational perspectives and how<br>do we do that uh with uh with a mindset<br>or wealth management and some of the<br>challenges that are associated with that<br>so i think that's just um that's just<br>the lead and that's on my thinking in<br>terms of you know my experiences within<br>the corporate i'm looking from a<br>different lens i suppose from from this<br>but none the least real and probably the<br>final thing i'll comment on is you know<br>how do we get it right living in the<br>real world where ultimately it's<br>uh and i'm not just talking in terms of<br>this territory but i'm talking globally<br>as well and then from indigenous<br>perspectives so how do we get the<br>balance right in terms of telemari<br>which<br>which is what we live and breathe in<br>terms of our culture and making sure<br>we've got the right balance in terms of<br>the old parque and the tensions that are<br>involved there so i'll leave that shelly<br>as my kind of opening remarks oh cool<br>dwayne thank you<br>so we'll turn to the questions now um<br>there's lots of questions coming through<br>so<br>first of all one for you liz and this<br>will be really drawing on your<br>background um with nzte and mb<br>but to what extent does the maori<br>economy need to be considered separately<br>from the overall economy including for<br>i really have to rattle my brains back<br>into that mb uh in space<br>um as a separate economy i<br>um<br>i guess at the top level i go to treaty<br>partnership and so i think not joined up<br>but what is a real partnership look like<br>it's not a subset it should be a joined<br>up in my view a totally joined up<br>economy where both partners are true<br>partners they understand each other<br>um and uh are respectful of each other<br>and to me that was i always used to<br>think of the phrase of we're growing<br>aotearoa new zealand and that's the the<br>kind of aha that we took offshore this<br>is where i'll tell new zealand we're a<br>from a policy perspective<br>what would i say if i<br>reflected on<br>previous previous ministers if you focus<br>on the greatest areas of need and the<br>greatest people of need<br>then you don't have to put a badge on it<br>like the mighty economy or the pacifica<br>economy or the anything else economy<br>you're just trying to lift all new<br>zealanders uh up to<br>um a better level a better living<br>standard a better life sort of thing so<br>in some ways i understand that but what<br>i saw across<br>policy in general was that it was very<br>general and it was sort of a one size<br>fits all and uh so for maori because we<br>do have the worst health stats housing<br>stats uh income stats all of that you<br>can either say the maoris need to get up<br>more we need to catch up to be a partner<br>uh or you can just say really focus our<br>effort and our policies where it's<br>needed and required and that will<br>naturally attract to and attach to maori<br>and also other vulnerable people in the<br>economy whether they are disabled or or<br>what have you<br>thanks liz and our previous speaker new<br>brian from treasury did mention that you<br>know particularly now in culver there's<br>these different impacts on different<br>parts of the economy and we can't have a<br>one-size-fits-all so that<br>also reflects what you're saying here<br>and and that you know maori do have a<br>different way of looking at things in<br>the sense of oftentimes a different<br>purpose it's inter-generational it's<br>underpinned by maori values and<br>sometimes those differences um force<br>businesses such as yourself into making<br>conscious compromises so it's not<br>necessarily<br>a one-size-fits-all economy<br>so that<br>working those tensions<br>wayne a question for you and you might<br>want to comment on the previous one<br>and see the way into this question<br>the maori economy is pretty heavily<br>skewed to the primary sector<br>so do you see this continuing or do you<br>see um more of a move into technology<br>i think you've got to realize that you<br>know from a maori perspective the phenol<br>and the other will always be very<br>significant for us<br>um so when we talk in terms of you know<br>fishing forestry uh farming um<br>we're always going to be uh you know in<br>in that space and it'll always be<br>significant for us in my view<br>but yeah i mean as as we're moving into<br>you know a world that's quite you know<br>challenging and diverse then you know<br>we've got food<br>we've got fashion we've got fiber and<br>we're starting to see other things kind<br>of come to the fold in terms of you know<br>the opportunities<br>for for maori and that will will agree<br>business play a big part going forward i<br>believe so in my view i i think<br>yeah it will i think there's a<br>significant amount of interest being<br>shown in finland maori from diverse<br>backgrounds<br>there's a greater appetite for probably<br>land use alternative land uses and<br>that's been driven by sustainability as<br>well<br>but there's a lack of basic and core<br>infrastructure<br>um in my view to to enable you know if<br>you know where development it's getting<br>better but but still there's a long way<br>to go<br>um and then you've got to take into<br>account you know some of the elements<br>other elements in terms of the<br>the changes to to to the fener act moddy<br>act um<br>and reforms to provide access to capital<br>are for fino and maori as well um i<br>think those things will have an impact<br>as well so my my answer is you're still<br>going to see a component of what we<br>understand those traditional sectors<br>particularly in<br>um you know at the agri-business space<br>uh but nonetheless you're starting to<br>see an appetite for diversity and going<br>into the areas where we believe are real<br>opportunities for us given you know our<br>background<br>and i think we can play significant role<br>in those areas as well<br>great thank you and a question for both<br>of you um wayne but we'll start with you<br>and then hand over to liz how do you and<br>how do we grow more partnerships between<br>maori and non-maori organizations and<br>what advice would you give firms wanting<br>to do business with maori<br>from my from my experience in recent<br>years it's quite interesting i think the<br>appetite<br>is a lot a lot higher now than probably<br>would have been a decade ago for sure um<br>i think the greatest challenge there is<br>is you know<br>how how do non-maori organizations go<br>about that<br>you know<br>what's their understanding now how do we<br>help<br>them with the understanding around what<br>a good treaty partner looks like<br>and across the corporate environment in<br>recent you know in the last years i've<br>seen a huge change in attitude and<br>appetite for that some big brands really<br>putting their hands up and saying can<br>you help us out we're not quite sure how<br>and i think they just you know need to<br>actually just take the measures and<br>steps that are necessary to position<br>themselves<br>to be treated as you know or to be seen<br>as good treaty partners<br>uh from uh from a uh manifesto<br>perspective i think it's really<br>important that they build those<br>relationships<br>they get them strong<br>or those those<br>focused organizations i think that's<br>really really important to see some<br>success here and i'm probably gonna also<br>comment in terms of crown agencies i<br>think that they probably now are<br>starting to have a change in mindset<br>around what that looks like you know in<br>some of those crown agencies mb mpi<br>nzte you're seeing a shift in that<br>attitude as well um but i i think<br>relationships with monofino are quite<br>key<br>uh to to get the shift that i believe<br>needs to happen<br>thank you wayne liz would you like to<br>comment on you know good partnering and<br>you know advice to businesses wanting to<br>work with maori so i'll take<br>a slightly different angle and pick up<br>on the last question actually around<br>how do you partner with maori so if i<br>think about the government and big<br>government agencies in particular it is<br>not about<br>having a mighty policy or sticking a<br>little maori team or person in the<br>corner in your big agency<br>any kind of commitment<br>um to partnership or learning more about<br>maori needs to start at the highest<br>level so it starts with your governance<br>and then it starts with your ceo and<br>your leadership team and it filters down<br>through the agency<br>so uh on the government side and the<br>same thing happens on the in the private<br>sector and so i'll mention tejono the<br>primary sector network has been an<br>amazing catalyst for bringing maori and<br>prime mainstream i'll call them primary<br>sector leaders together over a period of<br>eight or nine years bringing ceos<br>bringing directors together taking them<br>away together and what we have seen is<br>that far more connectivity in the<br>primary sector between maori and<br>non-maori you've seen a lot of cross<br>boards happening<br>and that really just comes back to<br>diversity diversity of thought diversity<br>of thinking and so in the primary sector<br>a lot of companies said we actually need<br>to know our people we need to get closer<br>to maori understand what their<br>aspirations are so you saw them taking<br>directors onto their board my own board<br>i have five amazing shareholder<br>directors and we bought on three<br>non-maori friends with very high and<br>very specific capability that we need<br>and together we work as a whanau and<br>bring all those perspectives to us and<br>then we sort of drop down from there so<br>wayne mentioned nzte<br>i was part of that and it was a<br>year-on-year growing with commitment of<br>the top to go from one maori executive<br>to about 40 when i left and the culture<br>of tikanga and um<br>underpinning and creating the glue of<br>nzte and it was very visible and very<br>relevant and very easy to reach out and<br>touch for the 45 officers around the<br>world who all wanted to tap into that um<br>who are we and what do we look like uh<br>and so yep diversity starts at the top<br>uh don't stick a little unit in the<br>corner uh you actually have to<br>um have to be it uh and aspire to it and<br>i would say pick up the phone and and<br>figure out who your local ewe uh is the<br>best place to start and go and have a<br>cup of tea with them<br>great thank you both very much we do<br>have other questions here and i<br>apologize we didn't get to them there<br>was a final question which i really<br>liked because it was very much about<br>that matakita<br>futurist vision of a future and would we<br>even have a term like the maori economy<br>and you know i like to think that we<br>will have a well-being economy based on<br>the principles of<br>kaitiakitanga a sustainable world in a<br>world where we're all well including our<br>environment and i really appreciate now<br>the rich insight that you have both<br>brought to our session it's insight<br>based on grounded practical experience<br>thank you both for sharing your<br>knowledge in in service of a better more<br>sustainable world and i really want to<br>thank our audience for the great<br>questions and for engaging and also to<br>the organizers and the tech support so</p></main><footer
