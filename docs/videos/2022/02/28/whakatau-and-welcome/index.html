management school<br>tarot papa<br>as you know from the program ahead of us<br>we have a great couple of days where<br>we're going to be traversing a lot of<br>topics<br>and a world that's frankly facing a lot<br>of challenges on many fronts<br>it's a very strong program unfortunately<br>of course we can't be here face to face<br>but it does mean that we've got a live<br>stream going out to a much broader<br>audience<br>before i hand across to neil quigley the<br>vice chancellor to formally open this<br>forum<br>on the screen where you're watching the<br>live stream please connect with the<br>slido app or the technology you can feed<br>through your questions the moderators<br>over the next two days will be able to<br>see those questions come through<br>and so they'll be able to feed those<br>through to the different panelists we've<br>got over the next two days<br>my name is matt bulger i'm the pro vice<br>chancellor of the waikato management<br>school and i'll be the host over the<br>next two days<br>now to formally open the 2022 new<br>zealand economics forum i'd like to hand<br>over to<br>the vice chancellor of the university of<br>to<br>greetings everyone<br>welcome and thank you all for attending<br>the second university of waikato<br>economic forum<br>the current economic environment is very<br>complex and so the discussions in this<br>forum assume a particular importance<br>more so because we have a great lineup<br>of speakers who are in each case both<br>well-known leaders in their field<br>and able to provide a wide range of<br>perspectives on the current economic<br>environment and the challenges that it<br>presents<br>to set the scene i'd like to take just a<br>few minutes to reflect on the complexity<br>of this current environment that we find<br>ourselves in<br>the covert pandemic has created both a<br>demand shock and a supply shock to the<br>economy<br>the demand shocks been managed to a<br>large extent by fiscal policy<br>with large-scale government spending on<br>wage subsidies and investment designed<br>to stimulate economic activity<br>of course the government response has<br>not been costless and in particular<br>public debt has increased substantially<br>the supply shock has reduced our<br>capacity to produce goods and services<br>in some but not all sectors<br>it's particularly apparent in the labor<br>market following the closure of the<br>border and the inability over a two-year<br>period to import both short-term and<br>long-term workers<br>as well as supply chain disruption<br>and of course significant increases in<br>the prices of many imported goods<br>the second area that's particularly<br>noticeable in the economy at present is<br>that there have been significant<br>relative price adjustments over the past<br>two years<br>while<br>some of those price changes are relative<br>uh domestic and international supply<br>chain disruptions and the closure of the<br>border mean that we face a real danger<br>of inflationary pressure becoming<br>widespread and feeding through into<br>inflationary expectations<br>with consequent implications for wage<br>and salary<br>expectations of course<br>up to this point there's been some<br>upward pressure on non-tradables<br>inflation that is domestic inflation<br>particularly in wage and salary<br>increases but the change<br>uh has been mostly in tradables<br>inflation<br>remember that we're coming off a decade<br>in which tradables inflation was muted<br>or at times negative<br>and even changes in oil prices were<br>swamped by a wider trend for imported<br>goods and services prices<br>to stay static or in some cases decline<br>at least in nominal terms<br>it's not clear<br>over what period<br>or even if the forces that drove that<br>period of subdued tradeable inflation<br>will re-emerge which puts more pressure<br>on our ability to manage<br>gdp in new zealand and our major trading<br>partners is now higher than before the<br>pandemic<br>but while some sectors have done and are<br>doing extremely well<br>in others it certainly does not feel as<br>though we're in the midst of a strong<br>recovery at this point<br>indeed a recovery at all<br>the country's annual trade services<br>balance has gone from an almost four<br>billion dollar surplus the end of 2019<br>to an over four billion dollar deficit<br>now an eight billion dollar hole<br>and this has occurred essentially<br>because new zealand has written off two<br>enormous<br>foreign exchange earners tourism and<br>international education and of course in<br>those sectors<br>affected by tourism and education<br>the implications of that change are<br>enormous<br>so i'd just like to briefly touch on a<br>few of the implications of this<br>environment and some of the things that<br>you'll be hearing about from our<br>subsequent speakers<br>one topic of conversation will be about<br>our attempts to manage inflation over<br>the next<br>period of time<br>so one of the things we know is that the<br>neutral interest rate at the moment<br>is lower than it was in the past<br>due<br>in significant part to a global glut of<br>savings<br>in addition there's a lot more debt in<br>the markets that will be affected<br>by interest rate movements including of<br>course in relation to mortgages<br>so interest rates probably don't need to<br>move as far as they did in the past to<br>have the required effect<br>on dampening inflationary expectations<br>you'll be hearing more about that later<br>in the forum<br>from the governor of the reserve bank<br>labor market shortages<br>are<br>in some minds anticipating to be<br>relieved reasonably quickly with the<br>announcement of the opening of the<br>border<br>but one of the things we know and i see<br>this from the perspective of the<br>education sector<br>is that<br>having<br>had our border closed for two years<br>means that it's not easy for immigration<br>new zealand to quickly turn around<br>uh to be acting in the way<br>that they were<br>before the covert pandemic hit<br>i think that means that labour market<br>shortages and<br>our ability to bring in international<br>students<br>and other key<br>aspects of our economy<br>are going to take some time<br>to return to what we were used to in the<br>past<br>a further significant area of discussion<br>in the forum which i think is obvious to<br>all of us as a really important<br>issue in our current economy and society<br>is the way in which the covert pandemic<br>all of the price changes and the<br>responses to the pandemic have affected<br>inequality<br>and i think we are all aware of the<br>implications of that<br>particularly as<br>the wealth of those who own houses has<br>increased relative to other people<br>in our society<br>and finally i mention<br>the social<br>psychological and political implications<br>of the pandemic and the public health<br>response<br>while<br>in this forum we'll be focused on the<br>economic issues<br>i hope that a future forum will focus on<br>some of those wider implications of the<br>pandemic and our response to it because<br>i think it's apparent to all of us<br>that things in new zealand have changed<br>substantially as a result of the<br>pandemic<br>the way in which people think their<br>attitudes and<br>the way in which we are talking about<br>them<br>have all changed and i think it's really<br>important<br>once we have just a little bit of<br>distance between us and the worst of the<br>pandemic that we have that conversation<br>can i close just by thanking uh the<br>conference organizers for all the work<br>that they've done to pull this together<br>and for their perseverance in having<br>the forum despite<br>the constraints of needing to do it<br>online<br>and to thank all of the speakers<br>for<br>their perseverance and sticking with us<br>as we move to online and being willing<br>to continue to participate we look<br>forward to all of the discussions uh<br>it's a great lineup of speakers and i'm<br>sure it's going to be a very lively<br>discussion uh thanks to all of you once<br>neil thank you<br>so i'm joined here by a special guest<br>for the next two days uh stephen joyce<br>former minister of finance former<br>minister of many things uh it's great to<br>have you here so as you know we've got a<br>big program ahead you'll be moderating<br>several of the sessions yourself we're<br>touching on everything from<br>uh health education maori economy uh<br>traditional fear of monetary and fiscal<br>policy what are the big themes that<br>you're looking at over the next couple<br>of days i think um<br>we've almost operating at about two<br>levels here we're actually uh dealing<br>with the uh economic<br>uh issues in each sector so you've got<br>the health sector which are you know we<br>know it's got big challenges education<br>sector the maori economy uh business<br>more generally uh so we're dealing with<br>those a lot of those today and then<br>we're also dealing with the<br>macroeconomic which sort of is over the<br>top of everything and neil as neil<br>mentioned we're dealing with the<br>inflation challenges uh which are out in<br>front of us frankly i think at this<br>point so we have tomorrow we have a we<br>have a panel with<br>monetary policy we also have the reserve<br>bank governor tomorrow fresh out of the<br>monetary policy statement on wednesday<br>so he'll be very interesting fiscal<br>policy as well tomorrow and of course<br>you're about to have treasury secretary<br>carlee mcleish as well<br>who will no doubt have her views on<br>where we're at and how we're going so<br>i'm looking forward to it i think it's<br>really important to have these<br>conversations at a time like this where<br>we have a lot of forced change caused by<br>firstly the pandemic but there's other<br>events in the world of course ukraine<br>and so on<br>and it's important we make that as wider<br>dialogue as possible so i'd encourage<br>everybody to to get in and uh and ask<br>their questions uh that the moderators<br>are all ready to to to have those<br>questions and air those questions with<br>the presenters and we're going to have<br>as much of a two-way conversation over<br>the next two days as possible with the<br>technology which is pretty good<br>brilliant thank you stephen so a timely<br>reminder please do<br>uh look at that slido app and get the<br>questions coming through they'll appear<br>on a screen for us here in the studio<br>big morning we're about to be joined by<br>dr carley mcleish<br>followed by a session on health and then<br>former prime minister the right<br>honourable helen clark will join us then<br>on through the afternoon</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
