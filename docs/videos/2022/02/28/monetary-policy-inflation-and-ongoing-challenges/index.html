the ongoing<br>discussion about how much inflation is<br>imported and how much of it is generated<br>internally<br>he did note and i've certainly picked up<br>that we had the i think he said one of<br>the biggest fiscal responses in the oecd<br>and also we've had one of the biggest<br>house price increases in the oecd<br>um in fact around the world<br>is wider than the oecd one of the<br>biggest house prices increases over this<br>period so the question is<br>uh is the bank in the exact right space<br>which seems to be adrian's view which i<br>suppose is understandable if you're the<br>reserve bank governor um and or we<br>should be doing something differently<br>and we now have three panelists who are<br>able to help us with that discussion to<br>no end so<br>we have firstly sharon zolner who's the<br>chief economist of our biggest bank the<br>anz bank we have grant spencer<br>former deputy reserve bank governor and<br>acting reserve bank governor when yours<br>truly was finance minister uh and also<br>currently the adjunct professor in<br>economics and finance at victoria<br>university of wellington and live from<br>london and thank you very much charles<br>for<br>giving us your time at this time of the<br>evening in london uh professor charles<br>goodheart who's the emeritive emeritus<br>professor of banking and finance the<br>london school of economics a very<br>illustrious panel<br>um the plan is team that we don't uh do<br>too long in the prepared comments you<br>know you've heard me on this already<br>five to seven minutes to lay out your<br>stall as to what you think uh uh we are<br>up to and what we should be doing uh and<br>then uh just discussion for about the<br>second half of our session so sharon<br>you've drawn the short straw so you get<br>to go first<br>thanks very much and thanks for inviting<br>me to be here again today<br>uh so i guess i'll step right back here<br>how did we we get here and i think there<br>is an emerging consensus on what<br>happened<br>and that is that when covert hits it was<br>widely thought um that it would be a<br>rerun of the gfc to some extent insofar<br>as that it would be a big<br>negative long lasting hit to confidence<br>and spending and therefore both monetary<br>and fiscal policy should do everything<br>they possibly could to shore up demand<br>and that while there were obviously<br>consequences for the supply side of<br>things that those would be relatively<br>short-lived and sort themselves out<br>pretty quickly because that's what<br>capitalism is good at however what we've<br>seen of course is the complete opposite<br>that with the very able support of both<br>monetary and fiscal policy what we had<br>was a series of very short-lived demand<br>shocks whereas the hit to the supply<br>capacity of the world and the ability to<br>move goods around<br>all that sort of thing has been<br>extremely long lasting and is showing no<br>signs of of getting better at all it's<br>still getting worse<br>and so of course that is a far far more<br>inflationary mix<br>and it's<br>obviously problematic that policymakers<br>got it wrong they weren't alone in that<br>though i mean we were also waiting for<br>the other shoe to drop thinking we're<br>not believing our own business surveys<br>businesses were telling us that we were<br>in one heck of a v-shaped recovery we're<br>going but<br>we've had a national income shock we're<br>all poorer now how can we possibly be<br>all spending like we've won lotto and<br>yet that's exactly what happened we had<br>incredibly strong retail spending um<br>underpinned by the very very strong<br>performance of the new zealand housing<br>market with house prices up um 40<br>since covert hit which is<br>quite something<br>um so and of course we now sit here with<br>much higher government debt um and much<br>and higher household debt businesses<br>however have have been um pretty pretty<br>prudent uh so they're not quite in the<br>same boat as some countries where every<br>sector has leveraged up um but<br>nonetheless we are sitting with a<br>heavier debt load<br>than we had before um and much much<br>higher asset prices so in new zealand<br>it's mostly about housing but this has<br>of course been a global phenomenon so<br>whether you're talking about equities or<br>bitcoin or some of the more obscure<br>cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens<br>people paying a thousand dollars or more<br>for the ownership of an anime picture<br>which is this different from this other<br>one that's for sale for us ten thousand<br>dollars you know people are buying<br>investments that they don't understand<br>even necessarily what they are or what<br>they're for or what the risks are around<br>them that has definitely been a thing of<br>the last couple years uh it was emerging<br>before that but the obviously the easing<br>and monetary conditions the massive<br>surge of liquidity uh really did put the<br>fire under that um we've been there<br>before and it didn't end well um and so<br>i think there does need to be some kind<br>of reckoning<br>in some pockets of asset markets where<br>risk has been severely mispriced um for<br>for a very long time<br>and of course the party's been able to<br>continue as long as central banks are<br>your friends but central banks are now<br>backed into quite the corner you know<br>u.s inflation is already seven percent<br>new zealand inflation could well end up<br>there uh given what's happening to oil<br>prices now um and so in that situation<br>there is really only one mandate that<br>counts everything else is a nice to have<br>um and so<br>with supply shocks there are unpleasant<br>trade-offs that central banks have not<br>had to face for a very long time in<br>terms of stabilizing employment and<br>output versus stabilizing inflation so<br>you can see that in the forecast the<br>reserve bank is forecasting raising the<br>official cash rate steadily<br>as house prices fall so that's<br>unprecedented and so<br>the question is you know having had this<br>boom<br>globally can we now solve this inflation<br>problem without a bust is there a<br>forward path for the official cash rate<br>that will bring inflation back to target<br>in an acceptable time frame without<br>causing a hard landing in the housing<br>market um and in the economy more<br>broadly because obviously the housing<br>market is extremely important um for the<br>new zealand outlook we're all<br>forecasting exactly that we're all<br>forecasting a soft landing that the<br>goldilocks scenario i mean it's not it's<br>still not great but it's the best of a<br>bad lot where the economy does struggle<br>we've got supply constraints most<br>obviously the supply of labor but it<br>really is across the board<br>board would be another pressure point um<br>but they're all over the economy so<br>we're going to struggle to deliver<br>strong growth in that environment we've<br>got rising interest rates falling house<br>prices um six percent inflation is a<br>massive cost of living impost on on<br>households now that's not a great growth<br>picture but we've got the reserve bank<br>raising rates throughout because that's<br>the reality of what you get with a high<br>with a supply shock<br>um so yeah our forecast for a soft<br>landing that would be pretty much<br>unprecedented that central banks managed<br>to beat seven percent inflation without<br>a recession somewhere in the mix<br>so perhaps that's a good segue to to<br>grant spencer to talk about what he<br>thinks the reserve bank should be doing<br>from this rather awkward starting point<br>thank you thank you very much sharon<br>there's lots of points there we will<br>come back to and you're right we will go<br>straight to grant<br>who's in the interesting position of<br>after a long period of time at the bank<br>and now an observer of the bank and<br>observer of the monetary policy<br>responses of central banks around the<br>world so grant<br>thank you well thank you stephen um and<br>thanks sharon<br>it's a pleasure to be here<br>um i'll make uh three points um the<br>first one is that i do think monetary<br>policy has been easy for too long<br>and the reserve bank does need to move<br>faster than this tightening cycle<br>inflation is the highest it's been since<br>1990 it's across all the main cpi<br>components<br>and so there is a real risk that<br>inflation is going to become embedded in<br>expectations<br>and become very difficult and costly to<br>remove down the track<br>and as sharon mentioned you know with<br>the further pressure on oil prices<br>that's just going to make it even more<br>difficult<br>now the bank you know was<br>relatively speaking an early mover<br>with its first tightening in august last<br>year<br>but it's still been slow<br>it's just been a bit faster than other<br>it's expecting to still really have its<br>foot<br>on the accelerator up until the end of<br>this year in other words it's not<br>expecting to get back to neutral<br>until the end of this year<br>so<br>um that's not a good place to be if<br>you've got a really serious uh inflation<br>problem brewing<br>you should be moving back to neutral<br>more rapidly<br>that that still is what's going to<br>reduce the regret of an embedded<br>my second point that is that<br>if the bank<br>does move more promptly<br>move faster<br>i think the overall tightening the<br>overall increase in the ocr in this<br>cycle<br>may not<br>need to be<br>huge<br>and it may not need to be as high as<br>the terminal rate of 3.4 percent that<br>the bank indicated on wednesday<br>the fact is you know some of these<br>touched on by sharon<br>is that you know a very high level<br>of<br>debt at the starting point<br>in the private sector particularly in<br>the household sector so that any<br>increase in ocr is going to quickly<br>um erode discretionary<br>incomes<br>we've got the weakening housing sector<br>the housing market<br>and we know the rafter factors affecting<br>housing apart from the higher interest<br>rates<br>so that's going to you know reinforce<br>the<br>impact of the tightening policy<br>and thirdly the the synchronization of<br>global monetary policies<br>so you know if the if if the reserve<br>bank<br>actions are going with the global tide<br>they're going to be a lot more effective<br>than when they're going against the tide<br>so you know i feel that if<br>the bank does move promptly the terminal<br>rate could be stay between you know two<br>and a half to three percent rather than<br>being north of uh three percent<br>if you're getting north of three percent<br>you that's the situation where you're<br>going to have embedded inflation as a<br>problem<br>and that risk of a hard landing that<br>sharon was talking about is going to be<br>greater<br>the third point i wanted to make was<br>around<br>the unconventional monetary policies<br>quantitative easing accrediteesing so in<br>our case the lsat program and the<br>in my view they can have benefits in the<br>short term<br>but bring significant risks and<br>distortions<br>the longer they're left in place<br>the main risk is that governments come<br>to rely on monetary financing of their<br>fiscal deficits<br>and the distortions is the undermining<br>of the fundamental drivers of term<br>interest rates which are the demand and<br>supply of loan funds and expectations<br>so while these policies may be used in a<br>crisis or an extreme situation<br>they should not become<br>if we look at the lsap i think the bank<br>is sensibly<br>you know winding that up we called the<br>whole july last year and on wednesday it<br>announced uh sort of a<br>uh the the total zeroing out the<br>government bond holdings on the reserve<br>bank balance sheet over five years i<br>think that's a reasonable approach<br>and<br>so i would support that<br>on the other hand with the funding for<br>lending program<br>you know this this program is in fact<br>more interventionist than quantitative<br>easing because it's a it's a subsidy<br>it's a lending subsidy<br>in this case to the banks<br>and when you're normalizing policy i<br>would think that that should be the<br>first policy removed<br>um<br>not the last policy removed and you know<br>the bank has that not finishing up until<br>december this year<br>so that remains a bit of a mystery to me<br>but my central point here is that<br>the unconventional policies can be<br>useful but they should be more seen more<br>in the stabilization<br>lender of last resort category rather<br>than being adopted as mainstream<br>policies<br>so<br>back to you stephen thank you very much<br>grant and we may come back on the<br>funding for lending program and uh<br>and of course other elements of your um<br>comments as we proceed<br>uh to get the full picture we're going<br>to now take uh charles uh good hearts<br>view from london charles has been a<br>friend of this country for a long long<br>time<br>uh he's had a relationship with the new<br>zealand reserve bank going back many<br>years and senior staff of the bank<br>and although it's fair to say in<br>preparation for this we've been giving<br>him a quick um<br>i suppose catch up on current situations<br>in this country obviously probably<br>helped by the last two speakers in their<br>comments so<br>charles with that in mind we'd really<br>appreciate your thoughts from a more<br>thank you very much i'm very glad to<br>talk to my various friends in new<br>zealand<br>um i'd like to start by saying that the<br>governor is absolutely right when he<br>says both that all central banks have<br>really followed exactly the same kind of<br>policies<br>uh facing the same kind of conditions<br>and that new zealand is not<br>unique in this respect in any way and<br>what is more that the reserve bank was<br>one of the very first to realize that<br>there was a need to stop<br>the massively expansionary monetary<br>policies<br>that all the central banks<br>had followed<br>nevertheless<br>i think the 2021 is going to come<br>out as a year<br>when all the central banks including<br>the rbnz actually got it wrong<br>and they got it wrong by not seeing the<br>persistence<br>uh and strength of the inflationary<br>pressures<br>that were<br>getting getting in place<br>i could actually illustrate that by<br>saying that one of the standard<br>approaches<br>to trying to decide what kind of<br>interest rate was appropriate<br>is the tailor rule and the taylor rule<br>says that you ought to raise interest<br>rates nominal interest rates by more<br>than the increase in inflation over the<br>target level<br>and by the degree to which your<br>unemployment is<br>below the sustainable rate<br>now if you do that for new zealand i<br>haven't actually done the figures<br>exactly<br>my guess is that what you would get<br>would be the taylor rule would suggest<br>an interest rate was somewhere between<br>six and seven percent<br>in other words double the sort of 3.4<br>uh that people have been talking about<br>uh as the neutral rate<br>well okay um this is because there's<br>been a supply shock<br>um and it's oil prices and the supply<br>shocks and the set and the other<br>um but i am<br>reminded very much<br>of how we got into the stagflation<br>conditions<br>in the 1970s<br>there was an oil shock in the 1970s<br>after the arab israeli war<br>when some of you who are older like me<br>will remember that oil prices doubled<br>the traffic quadrupled quadrupled went<br>up four times a much percentage higher<br>increase than we're likely to see now<br>and a lot of countries and a lot of<br>monetary<br>central banks thought that because this<br>was temporary you should look through it<br>the problem with that<br>is that when you get a sufficient<br>increase in prices<br>that it actually reduces people's living<br>standards and they don't like it and if<br>the labor market is strong enough they<br>will<br>seek and demand higher wages in line<br>and there was a difference between<br>countries which tried to absorb<br>uh the arab israeli oil shop like the uk<br>and italy which got into an inflation<br>price spiral<br>and germany which said well we must<br>accept this uh because we have got to<br>keep<br>the demand down so that we don't hit a<br>wage price spiral<br>now again you're talking about the<br>decline in housing prices<br>but i'm when you've got inflation rising<br>faster than the rate at which nominal<br>interests are going up<br>real rates are going down and people<br>will think that actually<br>the cost of borrowing in real terms<br>isn't rising yet very much<br>okay so that rises and nominal interest<br>rates will have an effect even if real<br>rates are still very low and for the<br>time being declining and given what's<br>been happening to oil prices and gas<br>prices and will happen to wheat prices<br>and food prices and fertilizer prices uh<br>the likelihood that inflation will rise<br>even further over the next three months<br>is almost baked in<br>and rising nominal interest rates are 25<br>percent when inflation is probably going<br>to be rising<br>at 50 basis points a month<br>is not what you might describe as<br>particularly strong<br>finally um the governor and<br>the general consensus was<br>okay we're going to go back to neutral<br>well<br>alan blinder as just is just writing a<br>book<br>looking at how the fed<br>tried to deal with inflationary spikes<br>over the years since 1965<br>and in most cases not all but in almost<br>every case<br>you actually needed<br>interest rates well above neutral<br>and you had to have<br>possibly a short recession in order to<br>bring the inflation spike back even if<br>the initial cause of the inflation spike<br>appears to be simply temporary because<br>you cannot allow a wage price spiral to<br>develop and the idea that people will go<br>on believing<br>in<br>that that inflation will come back<br>to low levels if inflation goes on<br>rising for a few quarters more is i<br>think somewhat wishful thinking<br>central banks are in horribly difficult<br>position<br>uh on the one hand if they don't do<br>enough inflation will get embedded on<br>the other hand if they do too much<br>i<br>anywhere and that's not any new zealand<br>it's anywhere in the world we could have<br>an asset price collapse leading to a<br>recession which will do no one any good<br>trying to get a soft landing under these<br>conditions is actually rather it's an<br>analogy i didn't set<br>i didn't make myself but i think it's<br>rather a good one it's like trying to<br>land a 747 on the deck of an aircraft<br>carrier you know one one little slip<br>either way and you're in you're in the<br>soup either inflationary soup or<br>recessionary soup i wish every central<br>banker and those of the monetary<br>committees the best of luck in an<br>extraordinarily difficult condition<br>situation and i think they will need a<br>hell of a lot of luck to get out of this<br>uh without their reputations being<br>in difficulty<br>thank you very much charles and i think<br>we should probably credit um former<br>prime minister bill english uh with that<br>uh uh new zealand former prime minister<br>bill english with that saying because i<br>where you and i discussed it earlier in<br>the week and we agreed that it was quite<br>a good one for the current um scenario<br>before we go back to the rest of the<br>panel i have a question for you it's<br>been<br>head scratching for me just how slow the<br>federal reserve has been<br>and just how little debate there was in<br>the us<br>beyond i think larry summers<br>about the inflationary effect of the<br>biden stimulus package soon after he was<br>elected<br>are we in a situation where people have<br>forgotten the lessons of history and<br>does that include the federal reserve<br>uh i think it does i'm people are really<br>quite my opinion<br>and<br>expectations you will expect what you<br>had in the recent past<br>they're not particularly good at looking<br>forward the idea that markets and sort<br>of swaptions and uh options<br>are a good predictor of what's going to<br>happen in the future the idea that the<br>difference between index linked<br>and nominal bonds are a good predictor<br>of what's going to happen in the future<br>that's for the birds<br>we can't foresee the future<br>um and we have to be<br>much more<br>quickly adaptive to current conditions<br>and the belief that central banks have<br>somehow credibly anchored uh inflation<br>expectations and therefore everything<br>will come back to normal is it i'm<br>afraid it's just wishful thinking<br>i want to bring in the rest of the panel<br>now if i could there's a great old<br>saying which comes from uh i think the<br>inflation the last inflationary period<br>is that monetary policy needs friends<br>and<br>the question we have now is<br>is<br>does<br>is monetary policy being complemented by<br>other government policies<br>or is there work to be done there i<br>think governments around the world are<br>trying to sort of contract out all<br>responsibility for inflation to their<br>respective central banks<br>in the new zealand context we have uh<br>minister robertson<br>talking about further increases in<br>spending in this year's budget<br>and we also have a government talking<br>about constraints further constraints<br>notwithstanding of course the very big<br>constraint at the moment of covert and<br>the borders but talking about tighter<br>immigration policy going forward than it<br>has been in the recent past<br>are we in a situation where<br>where other government policies going to<br>make the reserve bank's job harder to<br>achieve that goldilocks landing if you<br>thanks stephen yeah well those uh other<br>policies are very important i think<br>from the point of view of fiscal policy<br>per se we heard carolee<br>yesterday<br>and so even though spending has<br>increased and is staying at a high level<br>the actual fiscal impulse apparently<br>this actually is starting to come off so<br>the<br>the the fiscal impulse<br>because you know the economy has been<br>strong the tax tag has been great the<br>deficit hasn't been uh rising as fast as<br>expected<br>that fiscal impulse is not a big<br>counterweight to<br>tightening monetary policy<br>but you know the other policies you<br>mentioned the service ones that affect<br>the supply side<br>uh clearly<br>housing housing supply is<br>an important factor<br>uh where the government is is making<br>some contribution there and the other<br>very important one that you just<br>mentioned the migration<br>that clearly plays<br>is going to play a major role in terms<br>of the these supply side pressures so if<br>you're looking to ease the supply<br>supply-side pressures<br>by the freeing up of migration is<br>probably the biggest<br>factor<br>uh the biggest contribution they could<br>make<br>okay sharon what's your view should the<br>should the government be tightening its<br>fiscal response at this point<br>well in a pure macro economic monetary<br>policy friend perspective probably yes<br>but one of the unfortunate consequences<br>of this pandemic has been widening<br>inequality and so it's pretty difficult<br>to say there isn't a role for<br>government to try and address that<br>but then in so far as you're supporting<br>incomes and trying to boost spending<br>power then you are working in exactly<br>the opposite direction to monetary<br>policy but then you start getting into<br>the question of who is going to pay the<br>price for solving inflation is it going<br>to be businesses who find it harder to<br>pass on price increases and wear it in<br>their margins is it going to be minimum<br>wage or low wage earners who don't get<br>perhaps the wage increases that others<br>might or is it going to be highly<br>indebted uh recent home buyers you know<br>the the choices that monetary and fiscal<br>policy make will determine to some<br>extent who who wears the the cost of<br>that and what we have seen unfortunately<br>in the last two years is is that those<br>uh the more vulnerable members of<br>society have have won quite a lot of it<br>um and also the younger generation<br>they're the ones sitting there with the<br>fiscal debt they're the ones who have<br>paid through the no's for houses<br>and so you have to take that into<br>account as well unfortunately they're<br>not a very large voting bloc and they<br>seem to be a little bit athletic about<br>voting um but<br>i do think that that's something as well<br>that fiscal policy needs to take into<br>account uh but on a broader picture<br>we've got the the big the big numbers<br>but we don't yet know what they're going<br>to spend it on and in such a capacity<br>constrained economy i think that's going<br>to matter a huge amount in terms of how<br>much inflationary pressure it adds<br>charles what would be your advice to the<br>government of the day in<br>probably any country i suppose in terms<br>of<br>where they should be going with their<br>fiscal stance now and and their other<br>microeconomic regulatory policies<br>because it feels to me we're still<br>acting to some degree as if inflation is<br>not um the very significant problem that<br>um well again new zealand is not alone<br>it's not unique in any respect<br>uh on immigration<br>uh the population and particularly the<br>working age population for the uk and<br>the us<br>would go down from here on if it wasn't<br>for immigration<br>uh the only way that we're going to get<br>a<br>increased supply particularly<br>and this is something as an old person i<br>feel very strongly about of care workers<br>the proportion of old in our societies<br>is going to go up by leaps and bounds<br>it's not something that most people<br>attenuate in the uk<br>actually want to do we don't get<br>immigrants in to help us with it we're<br>going to have a crisis of lack of care<br>in the old<br>and<br>also a massive great increase in wages<br>for those carers so on immigration<br>policy<br>a lot of countries are going to have to<br>to uh to struggle with this particular<br>problem it's not just new zealand<br>it may well be that attitudes in towards<br>immigration of<br>the countries at large will have to<br>change actually quite dramatically one<br>of the other things that i would<br>advocate is that<br>uh prices of energy petrol gas and so on<br>are going to go way up one of the things<br>that i would suggest is that when these<br>prices as they will<br>start coming down<br>uh that you'll keep the domestic prices<br>high<br>in order to deal or help to deal with<br>both climate change<br>and the fiscal problem both at the same<br>time so that i would hope that ministers<br>of finance simply don't allow the<br>subsequent decline in energy prices<br>which will come<br>to bring about a decline in cpi take the<br>opportunity uh to raise taxes and keep<br>pressure uh on uh reducing fossil fuel<br>usage<br>folks i want to move to uh the impact of<br>ultra loose monetary conditions on asset<br>prices<br>um and then of course the the the flip<br>of that which is the potential for<br>a rapid downward trend in asset prices<br>now new zealand context of sharon's<br>pointed out it's it's it's it's through<br>the housing market more than anything<br>else<br>uh the<br>early on in the pandemic uh the governor<br>or was making quite a virtue of the fact<br>that one of the great things about<br>altruist monetary policy was people felt<br>wealthier<br>um because their house price was going<br>up and their asset prices were going up<br>and they then they could therefore feel<br>confident about borrowing more earlier<br>this week he was distancing himself from<br>that<br>and saying well they should have been<br>more careful potentially if uh interest<br>rates are now going to go up<br>so sort of a little bit of having your<br>cake and eating it too but nevertheless<br>one of the things that strikes me is<br>we've had a long discussion in this<br>country about house house supply and<br>and and the impact of various factors on<br>house prices but certainly in recent<br>times it seems<br>that you know no infla no<br>immigration uh<br>large numbers of housing consents and<br>building going on that we've we've<br>really been driven a lot by low interest<br>rates that that's that's pushed people<br>um to perhaps pay more than they would<br>ever pay previously in the housing<br>market<br>have we got a problem here<br>that as rates go up uh you know get to<br>three and a half percent in the bank<br>scenario possibly more than that and<br>charles's scenario i mean how are people<br>going to feel<br>uh if the impact is less equity in<br>housing and the drop in housing prices<br>about the whole monetary policy<br>construct i mean this is a big deal<br>isn't it isn't it isn't there a<br>political dimension to this in terms of<br>the impact of particularly first home<br>buyers<br>so i don't know who i'm going to throw<br>the ball to first but let's start with<br>with grant on that and then and then<br>sharon<br>well you're right<br>um stephen um<br>housing whether we like it or not has<br>been one of the main<br>and probably the main<br>transmission channels for monetary<br>policy for many years i'd say the other<br>main one is the exchange rate<br>and both of them can cause problems from<br>time to time<br>so<br>yeah when um when<br>with the initial easing of policy a lot<br>of the impact was was generated<br>through<br>increased wealth<br>increased house prices increased wells<br>people feel more confident better off<br>than they go out and spend<br>and aggregate demand<br>is boosted<br>and you know and the policy has effect<br>so<br>all of those sort of side effects<br>related to equity and difficulty for<br>first-time buyers etc<br>but basically the the reserve bank sort<br>of sidelined those and tried and tries<br>to play them down<br>even though they realize you know they<br>are real issues they're unintended yeah<br>distributional effects for example<br>but you know<br>monetary policy is not a perfect tool<br>and you know that's the way it has its<br>greatest leverage<br>as you say in the reverse scenario now<br>when we're headed down the other side<br>a lot of those effects are going to be<br>unwound and there's going to be a lot of<br>discomfort<br>for people existing homeowners<br>but maybe some of the you know the the<br>first potential first time buyers lining<br>up the younger people may feel a little<br>bit<br>better that that you know that maybe<br>housing is within reach after all<br>sharon i'm<br>conscious that you're in the front line<br>of this given that you know you're the<br>chief economist for new zealand's<br>largest bank so i imagine you'll step<br>carefully through this minefield um so<br>what's your read and<br>should we be worried probably as<br>policymakers um if you think about this<br>debate i mean one of the things i worry<br>about is whether we take asset prices<br>into consideration sufficiently<br>in monetary policy decisions so maybe we<br>can go a bit broader<br>yeah that is a thorny one because<br>bubbles are hard to identify in real<br>time but i i think there's a fundamental<br>problem actually with the way monetary<br>policy works and that is that recessions<br>are by their very nature unforecastable<br>they're basically a collective freak out<br>and that's a very unstable thing that<br>you can never forecast<br>so<br>therefore monetary policy<br>isn't forced to take into account the<br>consequences of its actions today on<br>what the next recession looks like<br>because we know another recession is<br>going to happen there's always another<br>recession um you don't know when it's<br>going to happen but in in norway the<br>central bank actually has as one of its<br>objectives to lean into to counteract<br>the build-up of financial imbalances<br>that might make the next recession worse<br>so i mean there are issues with that<br>what how much should you lend should<br>doesn't that risk you setting interest<br>rates higher than necessary sometimes<br>but it would at least force a discussion<br>about what are we doing to the next<br>recession because the depth of a<br>recession<br>depends very very much on the degree of<br>silliness that preceded it how how<br>bulletproof everybody felt<br>and we have definitely gone into the<br>silly zone in the last two years and we<br>are going to pay that price in the next<br>recession which you will not find in our<br>forecasts you won't find it in the<br>reserve bank's forecast<br>we're hopeless at seeing recessions<br>coming but we know they will come and we<br>know that the asset price appreciation<br>we've had in the last two years<br>is going to make that recession worth<br>worse was it worth it did we even even<br>ask that question the framework doesn't<br>actually encourage central banks when<br>they're setting policy to think about<br>that that bigger picture it's all about<br>maximizing growth in the near term if<br>it's currently too low<br>um obviously we're in a different game<br>now where they're trying to dampen<br>growth but<br>yeah we've overfilled the hole<br>and and now i'm a little bit worried<br>that we have actually unnecessarily<br>exacerbated the business cycle and how<br>bad that's going to get we we don't know<br>but we are currently in in quite a<br>fragile situation can i just make a<br>comment there a relevant comment chair<br>is that<br>um<br>sharon's point<br>in the reserve bank legislation it does<br>actually say that monetary policy should<br>have shall have regard for financial<br>stability<br>you know there's the objective financial<br>stability objective and there's the<br>dual mandate<br>now<br>you know in the in that major easing<br>that happened in early 2020<br>there was no there was no mention of the<br>having regard to financial stability<br>but you know this is something you do<br>that the central banks have to think<br>about and and different governors and<br>different central banks think about it<br>in varying degrees some put more<br>emphasis on the financial stability<br>aspect this<br>uh this<br>you know costs of<br>generating asset price<br>extreme asset price movements<br>and if that had been given more weight<br>in early 2020 you know maybe that<br>initial<br>major easing would not have been so<br>great when it started to become apparent<br>that housing was going to really take<br>off<br>but that i just uh yeah put that in<br>there there's there is that capacity in<br>the framework<br>the governor talks a lot about the least<br>regrets policy and every time he says it<br>worries me a little bit it was sort of<br>like just go big and then go bigger and<br>we'll worry about it later that's how i<br>interpreted it a little bit<br>charles can i bring you in i mean this<br>is not the first time we've had a debate<br>about asset price bubbles and<br>loose monetary conditions you have alan<br>greenspan back in the 90s and and then<br>they had the<br>dot-com bubble<br>here we are again<br>potentially<br>is is do central banks as a rule take<br>enough notice of the impact of of of<br>i think that you could uh suggest that<br>they take too much concern not all of<br>the central banks but the fed in<br>particular as you mentioned the<br>greenspan put<br>whenever asset prices in the us have<br>gone down really sharply<br>the fed has<br>come back from any restricted policies<br>in order to ensure that asset prices<br>don't collapse too much<br>uh and the very fact that<br>financial markets are declining quite<br>sharply after<br>putin's invasion<br>means i think that at the<br>next fed fomc<br>we are almost bound to get 25 basis<br>points rather than 50 basis points<br>because they don't want to upset markets<br>too much because they don't want to<br>upset markets too much<br>not not just<br>out of interest for the markets and such<br>but if you upset markets too much uh you<br>can get a recession there's always the<br>fear of 1929<br>at the back of the mines of central<br>bankers<br>and uh the very concern about<br>uh asset markets being too frothy<br>and the likelihood is that the from now<br>on there's going to be quite a sharp<br>decline<br>um means that it's going to be very hard<br>for the fed and for anybody else any<br>other central bank<br>really to raise interest rates<br>sufficiently fast uh to keep a wage<br>price spiral from developing and getting<br>going<br>and it's a very very nasty situation<br>you want to<br>tell the markets<br>no we're not going to support you<br>in which case under present<br>circumstances you put a free fall in<br>recession<br>or you effectively say we're going to do<br>things very gently and we're going to<br>warn the markets every time we're going<br>to move that sort of thing<br>and then the likelihood that a wage<br>price spiral will develop is actually<br>quite high<br>and aren't we at the point where this is<br>that that<br>that<br>approach has got completely out of hand<br>i mean look at the look at the multiples<br>of share prices um on the us stock<br>exchange the nft phenomenon<br>uh you know all the other things we<br>could highlight from earlier this year<br>the the i think it was the<br>the um takeaway joint that was worth you<br>know a couple of hundred million um the<br>whole thing<br>feels like this has all gone a bit too<br>far doesn't it um and if if the bank at<br>the federal reserve is running scared of<br>upsetting asset markets then really<br>effectively the green span put continues<br>and we'll never get back to a more sort<br>matrix if you like<br>he said um sounding slightly um worried<br>about these things sharon any any<br>thoughts from you there<br>you can suppress all evidence of risk<br>for a surprisingly long time but you<br>cannot eliminate risk as a central bank<br>and so i think people for a long time<br>have thought oh central bank's got our<br>backs um it's we're all good but you<br>know that that risk that volatility it<br>gets bottled up and then it explodes so<br>i don't doubt we're going to get back to<br>a more sustainable and sensible<br>valuation for assets we may undershoot<br>but but we'll get there because<br>those market forces will not be denied<br>forever it just could be a bit of an<br>uncomfortable path as i think i think<br>we're all on the same page on that one i<br>sense that if i think i pulled this<br>panel on the likelihood of achieving a<br>soft and gentle landing it it might not<br>fare well um with with with the three of<br>you can i get one final word then on the<br>russia ukraine situation charles you've<br>already made the point about the risk of<br>increased commodity prices further in<br>some of the key commodities um is there<br>a chance for example uh well will it<br>will this make the current situation<br>worse you think from a you know economic<br>perspective and of course you know we're<br>all very worried for the people of<br>ukraine and<br>and there's a much bigger issue than the<br>immediate sort of economic impacts but<br>here we are talking about macroeconomics<br>or is there a risk actually that it<br>sends uh it sends the markets into a<br>negative tailspin which which actually<br>alleviates the inflation risk or at<br>least assists the central banks<br>with the inflation<br>is that both are going to happen markets<br>are already<br>weakened<br>uh i think they're inevitably going to<br>weaken further<br>but<br>in the short run this is a massive<br>further adverse supply shock<br>which sends prices higher and<br>the prices of fertilizer for example and<br>in the uk absolutely virtually triple<br>uh you reduce massive wheat<br>uh exports from ukraine and russia<br>and the prices of basic foodstuffs of<br>flour<br>are going to be shooting up over the<br>next six months i don't care if there's<br>any alternative<br>um and they<br>only just makes the<br>both the outlook uh and the problems of<br>market weakness on the one hand and<br>inflation getting out of hand on the<br>other uh that much worse and it's it's<br>bad news uh however you look at it<br>grant and sharon particularly from a new<br>zealand perspective um<br>well you know it's a it's a terrible<br>event<br>um and it it will have significant<br>short-term effects but being sort of<br>clinical about it<br>from a from a sort of an historical<br>perspective um<br>if you look at the impact of wars on<br>financial markets often it can be quite<br>a short sharp<br>uh sell-off<br>um i i don't have much doubt that the<br>market i mean the markets are selling<br>off but it's not major<br>obviously if it blew up into something<br>really<br>more serious and bringing in other<br>countries then that's a different<br>picture but<br>the way it's looking now<br>i would see markets uh bouncing back<br>and even now you know the market analyst<br>focusing on really you know what the<br>fed's going to do whether it's going to<br>be<br>starting to adjust from 50 points back<br>to 25 points<br>you know and focusing on the policy as<br>opposed to this particular um<br>geopolitical event in europe<br>and just just one point on the interest<br>rates in terms of those overvalued<br>assets<br>that<br>you know in the in the recent cycle<br>the central banks of this world have<br>contributed to zero and negative rates<br>so they've really exacerbated<br>um those elevated asset prices but<br>underlying that over the past 20 years<br>has been a<br>downward secular trend<br>in uh real interest rates which has been<br>the underlying driver of the of the very<br>strong um asset prices<br>over the past 10 10 years and longer<br>so you know i just don't want to<br>exaggerate or overstate the the central<br>bank's contributions of this<br>underlying real factors<br>that are driving these markets as well<br>very fair point sharon we'll let you<br>have a final word on any of these topics<br>there's so much to talk about uh yeah<br>obviously new zealand doesn't have much<br>direct trade exposure to russia or<br>ukraine but it does seem likely to boost<br>world oil prices and energy more<br>generally um and it's also hit the new<br>zealand dollar so that all adds up to<br>more pressure petrol pump and the<br>reserve bank basically said that that<br>increase in global infra inflation<br>pressures was a big driver of why they<br>thought the ocr needed to stay higher<br>because their framework it basically<br>assumes that that has the potential to<br>have a persistent impact on inflation<br>expectations and in this environment<br>it's very hard to disagree so in that<br>context it definitely increases the<br>chance of the reserve bank hiking by 50<br>um at some<br>meeting in the in the future um if it<br>persists because it's going to boost<br>headline inflation but beyond the near<br>term it's it's symptomatic of a world<br>where geopolitical risk is a growing<br>threat and i think that's going to<br>contribute to<br>partial unwinding of the globalization<br>which has been such a deflationary force<br>in the last decade or two and so i think<br>it just does underpin that we're no<br>longer in a world where inflation needs<br>to be lovingly nurtured where we're in a<br>world where it needs to be smacked on<br>the head regularly uh which isn't in a<br>way back to normal and not entirely bad<br>in that sense but we've got we've got<br>quite a problem on our hands uh for now<br>though and i think we're all<br>pretty much on the same page that that's<br>going to be a very very challenging<br>environment for some some time yet<br>thank you very much all three of you for<br>your time a sobering assessment but also<br>very a a very<br>sensible assessment of where things are<br>at charles thank you very much for<br>joining us from london late in the<br>evening there now i know we do<br>appreciate your contribution and also to<br>grant and sharon thank you very much for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
