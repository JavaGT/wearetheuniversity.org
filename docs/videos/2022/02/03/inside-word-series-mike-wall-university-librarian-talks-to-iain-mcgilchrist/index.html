us and have a chat you've got quite<br>an adventure<br>um as to how you arrived at otago to get<br>to this point um so<br>welcome um i hope you're enjoying your<br>time in dunedin so far i've got a list<br>of questions um a mile long we've got<br>some very good research elves<br>but um i thought maybe let's start by by<br>asking one question that has really has<br>been on my mind as i've been in the<br>university libraries uh lots of times<br>how good are staff and how good are<br>students that returning their library<br>books on time<br>um that's quite a narrow question but um<br>yeah i understand why why you're where<br>you're asking<br>understanding so far is is pretty good<br>um<br>i think this is something across the<br>globe that um university libraries are<br>getting less concerned about now than<br>they<br>have been in in the past and that's um<br>partly through the expansion of digital<br>provision and actually that that changes<br>the the approach<br>for many students so um<br>yeah i have to say that's not a question<br>that<br>many people have raised with me so far<br>either<br>inside the library from students or or<br>or outside the uh sorry inside um the<br>library with library staff or outside<br>the library with students so<br>um<br>i don't think it's a big issue for us<br>all the university<br>excellent well i noticed with some sort<br>of horror that now as i went to get a<br>book from the library myself recently i<br>thought i don't know how to get a book<br>out anymore<br>because everything has changed so much<br>um since i since i first used the<br>library here yeah so um<br>look can we get into your your story of<br>how you arrived here in new zealand you<br>you hail from the uk originally<br>that that's correct yeah i lived um all<br>my life in the uk um until january the<br>end of january this year<br>um<br>i mean the reason i've uh i applied for<br>the job at otago was<br>i supposed to twofold one was um career<br>aspiration to become a university<br>librarian following<br>working at university of bristol for<br>many years and then more recently at the<br>university of durham<br>in both locations as deputy university<br>librarian<br>so partly it was a career aspiration and<br>partly we came wife and i came to new<br>zealand for a holiday extended holiday<br>five weeks back in 2018 the end of the<br>end of the year<br>and that was drew because our eldest son<br>has been in new zealand<br>actually been here now seven years<br>so that was our first visit uh to the<br>country and we just<br>loved the country we felt um a real<br>affinity<br>uh with the country and<br>it was later in 2019 towards the end of<br>2019 that the target job was advertised<br>and i had a a good conversation with the<br>recruitment company about the role and<br>the the university in the city and<br>um it lined up in a lot of ways so<br>research intensive university with great<br>reputation for research and for<br>education<br>um<br>a long established university with a<br>great reputation but also a relatively<br>small city and um<br>that was<br>one of the more challenging aspects of<br>finding a role that i felt would suit me<br>was finding a university in a small city<br>i think too there's a nice connection<br>you know dunedin and durham uh they're<br>both very much university cities where<br>the university is the focus of the city<br>so to some extent while it's uh you<br>can't get much further away from durham<br>than<br>dunedin um it's uh it's probably been<br>quite useful in making you feel<br>reasonably recently at home here quite<br>quickly in fact i couldn't have gone to<br>a university further away in in the<br>whole world and yeah without coming back<br>home again yeah yeah yeah<br>um<br>you your undergraduate studies you you<br>sp you majored in sport science is that<br>right that's correct yeah i did a<br>three-year undergraduate honors degree<br>in sports science back in the 1980s when<br>it really wasn't very common at all it<br>was<br>a relatively small number of<br>institutions<br>did sport science and<br>it really just aligned uh two of my<br>my passions really i suppose<br>and felt i'd have a really good academic<br>three years studying sports science and<br>i did it was a really good program<br>so can you talk us through the bridge<br>between you your your sport signs and<br>becoming a university librarian<br>that's an interest i mean<br>the starting point really was doing my<br>final year<br>dissertation and uh realizing<br>the library the institution i was at<br>wasn't going to meet the needs that i<br>had for for the information resources<br>so i um over the summer between the<br>second and third year i went to a couple<br>of<br>university libraries<br>in birmingham and in loughborough who<br>had very strong<br>services and collections for sport<br>science and i just realized<br>what a difference a really good library<br>makes to an academic career<br>whether it's as an undergraduate or<br>beyond so that sort of set my mind<br>thinking about future future directions<br>so<br>um while there's no<br>particular connection between sports<br>science and and working in in libraries<br>um<br>i honestly believe that any degree sets<br>you up for a very wide range of uh of<br>future work<br>um so it's all about you know what you<br>learn as a person and what you learn<br>sort of in analytical skills um<br>interpersonal skills and<br>and those generic uh skills that<br>actually<br>set you up for any any role so it's<br>really the the idea that i could<br>make a difference to<br>to the education and research<br>opportunities within higher education<br>through<br>being part of a library service yeah<br>yeah<br>so your career so far has seen you in<br>leadership roles in libraries for a<br>number of years now<br>uh<br>what was it that that sort of drove you<br>into leadership well do you have a<br>particular uh inspiration that led you<br>into a leadership role<br>um yeah it's a good question<br>i was in a way quite a slow burner as a<br>um<br>as a professional academically i um<br>probably didn't put as much effort in as<br>i<br>i could have done i was too busy playing<br>sport if i'm absolutely honest um<br>so i didn't have particularly particular<br>goals right from the start of my my<br>academic career<br>and before working in universities i'd<br>worked in hospital library<br>and public library for a while so i had<br>some different experiences and then<br>moving to the university of bristol<br>i suppose<br>i started to feel um okay there's a real<br>career<br>a role that i had managing a relatively<br>small branch and education library with<br>around 10 staff was my first real<br>leadership experience um you know on a<br>relatively small scale<br>um but it was actually the contact with<br>senior staff within the university who<br>sort of set my aspirations a bit higher<br>and gave me the confidence<br>that actually i could progress a career<br>but even so i didn't really have a<br>particular plan i was very focused on um<br>family and and staying local so i didn't<br>move institutions um to gain experience<br>that way<br>um but through<br>talking with senior colleagues and<br>taking opportunities to do lots of<br>different things within the university<br>library<br>um that led me to develop a wide range<br>of<br>skills and knowledge across library<br>services so i i did things<br>related to university library-wide staff<br>digital literacy information literacy<br>training sort of supporting academic<br>live academic librarians to teach<br>within their faculty programs<br>but also a wide range of things<br>relating to<br>areas not directly<br>for my role<br>so things like disaster planning for<br>libraries i had no experience in that<br>but i was just given a task<br>to develop a program and a policy<br>so it's through that wide range of<br>experiences that i started to<br>to develop informal leadership<br>good um i'd like to know a bit more<br>about your thoughts on leadership in<br>general what what makes a good leader<br>particularly in an academic field<br>such as the university<br>uh i mean i'm a strong believer in<br>personal qualities<br>and qualities that really allow<br>teams to to flourish<br>without having to continually ask<br>permission<br>to to develop ideas and to take<br>initiative so<br>i'm very much a collaborative<br>open leader who<br>expects a lot of of staff but also gives<br>a lot back and<br>gives opportunities for staff to<br>take initiative and develop their own<br>ideas within a<br>strong framework of the direction of<br>travel<br>which should in my view be developed<br>with a<br>wide range of library staff and<br>partners outside the library<br>whether they're academic departments or<br>professional services or indeed<br>people from outside the university for<br>whom we provide services yeah you said<br>two of my favorite words when it comes<br>to leadership you're hinted at enabling<br>and flourishing it was<br>very nice to hear thank you<br>um can we come to uh your transition<br>from durham university to uh otago tell<br>us a little bit about the the<br>the year that that took it took an<br>awfully long time obviously um no fault<br>of your own but can you talk us through<br>that that story please<br>yeah so i mean in fact it was really<br>almost 18 months from expressing<br>interest in in the post and talking with<br>recruitment<br>company<br>um and then having zoom interviews um<br>and then being invited out for interview<br>in<br>uh the end of february<br>2020<br>um so there was quite a lot of uh<br>waiting before i got to interview<br>um obviously the academic year in the uk<br>runs from<br>um september around to june whereas<br>in new zealand<br>that period around christmas and after<br>christmas was uh the summer so there was<br>a bit of a lull in in the recruitment<br>activity<br>um but i came for interview uh brought<br>wendy my wife<br>um to new zealand so she could<br>experience<br>dunedin as a city and location where we<br>were obviously considering moving<br>so i had a four day<br>recruitment interview process on site um<br>which was<br>slightly daunting to start with but once<br>i got into the process and understood<br>what it was about it was<br>really a two-way process<br>so an opportunity for me to talk with<br>academic and<br>library colleagues<br>senior university leaders um<br>and for the university to find a bit<br>more about me so that process was was<br>really uh interesting and<br>um gave me a<br>a good basis onto it under which to make<br>the decision about<br>uh when i was offered the job would this<br>be the right one for me<br>um like what you said there about being<br>a very much a two-way mutual process so<br>maybe maybe feel free not to answer this<br>question but when you got to that stage<br>in your interview process where you were<br>asked have you got any questions for us<br>what were you keen to find out<br>um i mean by the by the time i got to<br>the interview um there were not many<br>more questions left to ask if i'm honest<br>because i'd ask so many<br>um you know ranging from<br>you know what's it like working in the<br>university what's the culture in the<br>university what's the direction of<br>travel for that culture<br>um<br>what's done even like as a as a city<br>um<br>so i've done a lot of those questions<br>about fit you know<br>how do people feel about living in in<br>dunedin um you know the probably the<br>most southern university in<br>in the globe<br>um that distance from other universities<br>which is obviously a a feature of new<br>zealand<br>um but also that sense of where is the<br>university going and<br>um<br>i really liked the the concept of<br>moving away from a uk style university<br>to one that really is around um<br>a university that's serving new zealand<br>population as a whole but also the wider<br>pacific region and um i think for me<br>that was a really exciting<br>exciting aspect of the university's<br>direction<br>yeah i'm struck by what you said about i<br>think there's a phrase in a famous new<br>zealand song about the tyranny of<br>distance that new zealand often<br>experiences and arguably you know otago<br>being the world's southernmost<br>university experiences it more acutely<br>than others have you felt any of the the<br>tyranny of distance or isolation or<br>being disconnected from the world<br>uh<br>i haven't yet um i mean the experiences<br>that i had at the university of durham<br>which um<br>felt remote from much of the rest of the<br>uk<br>not really geographically because it's<br>you know<br>not too far you know you can get down to<br>london within um<br>five hours easily<br>um but more it was a cultural difference<br>in cultural isolation um in the<br>northeast of england so<br>i was sort of prepared for that type of<br>experience so i'm<br>very much aware of the um<br>the variation in view that uh from the<br>north of the north island from auckland<br>you know that dunedin is always freezing<br>cold<br>um and that sort of sense of remoteness<br>but i'm not feeling that that myself<br>yeah<br>excellent excellent so as you uh you you<br>were appointed uh and you and your<br>family uh were<br>moving to new zealand uh and then covert<br>hit<br>and that threw an enormous standard in<br>the works and can you tell us about your<br>experience uh with<br>either what was it like having to wait<br>so much time um and then arriving in new<br>zealand and miq what was that experience<br>like for you yeah so that um<br>from being offered the job and accepting<br>the job um in principle uh the right of<br>the beginning of<br>march last year<br>um i made a conscious decision not to<br>resign from my<br>uh my post at durham until i got a visa<br>um and that was uh otago were happy with<br>that that approach<br>um<br>so it was you know coming back to to the<br>uk<br>really kovid was just in the margins so<br>in europe there were<br>a lot of concern about italy or areas<br>within italy um and obviously within<br>china<br>globally<br>but there was really no indication of<br>what was to come so we started<br>immediately on getting our visa<br>applications<br>progressed um<br>but actually the day we<br>uh completed our visa applications was<br>the day that new zealand<br>closed its borders<br>so from that point we have this real<br>uncertainty<br>um<br>i think if i'm honest i didn't expect a<br>delay<br>beyond a couple of months you know so i<br>would have expected a three month notice<br>period so you know i thought i was<br>probably going to take four months from<br>being<br>invited for the post<br>tour to arriving um<br>i thought okay delay maybe another month<br>or two that's that's not too bad it<br>means i'll have a<br>slightly longer summer in the uk before<br>coming over to new zealand and and<br>coming to the spring<br>um but it got to probably august<br>2020 and really there was no sign of<br>things changing<br>and i had a really good conversation<br>with<br>the deputy vice chancellor academic pat<br>craig<br>just about<br>what were the next steps um i think pat<br>was concerned<br>that i was going to turn around and say<br>i'm not prepared to wait<br>i was slightly concerned that the<br>university was going to say we're not<br>prepared to wait and we'd end up passing<br>parting ways but neither of us were<br>taking that approach so<br>we had a period where the university was<br>able to make a case to<br>immigration um<br>for me to have an exemption<br>the first<br>application was refused but the second<br>application<br>that was put in in august<br>late august was accepted<br>and this was probably late october<br>and then it was a case of reapplying for<br>a different<br>visa<br>which we did very quickly<br>turned that around in about 24 hours<br>and then<br>a month i think a bit less than a month<br>visa application was approved so we<br>could then<br>apply for miq<br>um<br>places for for wendy and i and um<br>from that point in early december it was<br>you know all systems go selling the<br>house<br>preparing to move and um the miq um<br>places were available at uh towards the<br>end of january 26th of january so we<br>had flights booked and everything sorted<br>um it was a really concerning christmas<br>actually from having thought<br>everything's done to<br>seeing countries closing so our flight<br>was through<br>singapore and they effectively closed<br>their borders to the uk<br>um but the recruitment team otago were<br>fantastic actually in just taking all<br>that pressure off us and saying we'll<br>sort it all out<br>so in the end we<br>had to take a test cover test<br>within 72 hours of flying<br>which we managed to do got a negative<br>test<br>traveled down to london for the flight<br>we had to stay on the plane in singapore<br>we couldn't get off um so it was the uh<br>actually turned out fine it was an hour<br>on the plane we didn't have to wander<br>around a<br>massive airport<br>um and then arrived in new zealand<br>whisked into the cbd in auckland<br>into a great hotel four seasons um<br>in the cbd<br>thinking we'd have a relaxing fortnight<br>before flying down to uh to dunedin<br>it wasn't quite a relaxing fortnight<br>though was it from from no it wasn't um<br>i got really stressed by not having uh<br>nice coffee for a while and then that<br>paled into insignificance<br>once uh my wife tested positive for<br>covid on our seventh day in new zealand<br>um<br>which was such a surprise because we've<br>been so careful in in the uk we've not<br>been into a supermarket<br>since march 2020<br>and you know we signed the contract for<br>selling our house on the street we<br>didn't go into the solicitors<br>premises were<br>under umbrellas in the pouring range<br>signing our contracts so we've done<br>everything um<br>to avoid any kobe contact um but somehow<br>when he contracted it may have been at<br>the airport in the uk it may have been<br>on the plane we don't we don't know<br>so we were then moved from<br>the hotel in cbd in auckland to to jet<br>park<br>where we were really uncertain what<br>would happen next<br>i had<br>i think probably<br>10 negative covid tests on arriving in<br>new zealand<br>before we decided that i would<br>separate from wendy in in the hotel<br>as a way of trying to speed up our<br>combined discharge<br>in the end that didn't work as uh<br>my 11th kobe test was positive<br>so i then had to wait uh until i was<br>symptom-free<br>um for three days<br>so yeah it was uh an intriguing and um<br>frustrating but<br>looking back on it we got away lightly<br>really if you just think about how<br>devastating covert has been on people's<br>health<br>across the globe and you know we had<br>four days of<br>each<br>four days feeling really unwell but um<br>being well looked after and um knowing<br>what was coming for us which was<br>settling into dunedin<br>it's a really interesting story that it<br>just seems like almost a year of hurdle<br>after hurdle for you both um so i i<br>expect that when you finally did arrive<br>here indeed and there was you know quite<br>a quite a sense of relief<br>um can we maybe move on and talk more<br>about your role as the university<br>librarian uh now here at<br>otago um<br>the<br>we're very proud of the tiger of the<br>experience our students have you know<br>we're very much a a student-centered<br>university it's a a<br>you know a student town if you like<br>um part of that is pursuing academic<br>excellence as well as social and<br>cultural and sporting activities you<br>know the whole round person how do you<br>think the university libraries<br>contribute to the students experience<br>a really good question i think the you<br>know the line the role of the library<br>should be around um uplifting students<br>academic aspirations and just uh<br>exposing them to<br>not just the the content and the skills<br>that they need to develop but also<br>allowing them to go into areas<br>of<br>the academic<br>academic disciplines that aren't<br>necessarily directly related to the<br>course that they're doing<br>so<br>making connections in in different<br>academic uh disciplines um<br>experiencing um<br>you know not just the academic uh pure<br>academic side but you know if we think<br>about the hawken collections<br>um and the exhibitions uh and the<br>cultural materials that they can<br>experience<br>through that uh you know a very<br>different type of environment to the<br>collections so it's really trying to<br>provide that breadth of academic um<br>information knowledge experience um the<br>cultural knowledge and experience that<br>can be<br>obtained through<br>materials whether they're in print<br>whether they're digital<br>delivered in different ways<br>but also enabling students to feel<br>really safe and comfortable<br>in their learning environment so having<br>physical<br>spaces that are<br>um suitable to the whole range of<br>academic requirements um and individual<br>requirements so for students to be able<br>to bury themselves and isolate<br>themselves for a period of time so they<br>can<br>get their head down do that really<br>serious study but also<br>um have the opportunity to to be in<br>spaces where they're surrounded by<br>friends or others who are working hard<br>but also to be able to engage with other<br>students<br>to whether it's group work or studying<br>in preparation for assignments or<br>examinations or<br>presentations and how that range of<br>facilities<br>that enables them to do that whole<br>a wide range of academic work<br>i do know what you're saying about the<br>the libraries having a very important<br>role in sort of collaboration and<br>cooperation you know between students<br>and and also you know with academic<br>staff as well um every time i go into<br>the libraries i'm so impressed at how it<br>just feels warm and inviting and people<br>want to be there<br>um<br>yeah i mean i think on um probably<br>within my first couple of weeks i walked<br>around the library with with helen<br>nicholson who was at that point<br>my line manager was deputy vice<br>chancellor academic although now she's<br>acting university librarian we just<br>walked around the library this was in<br>early march this year so relatively<br>early on in the semester<br>and that was the experience we both both<br>felt were just that<br>impression of how busy the library was<br>how many students were there<br>um<br>but actually the variety of study that<br>students were undertaking and the<br>commitment they have to their study um<br>you know i think that's a<br>a distinctive feature of research<br>universities<br>yeah um which you know is why i so much<br>love working in research universities<br>well i've got a challenging question for<br>you now um<br>my research elf has given me the<br>library's strategic directions to 2022<br>document<br>and here's a quotation from it it says<br>it's more important than ever that the<br>library engages proactively in<br>rethinking its role in the digital era<br>and the way it delivers services to the<br>university's communities<br>so how do you see some challenges or<br>opportunities or both<br>in research and teaching<br>in a digital and a covered and<br>post-covered era<br>i mean it is really interesting<br>reflecting on documents that were<br>written pre-covered and<br>and actually this is one document that<br>sort of<br>um<br>doesn't exactly perceive the future but<br>the future it foresaw was absolutely<br>relevant to a covered and postcoded<br>covered world so<br>um that transition to um or from a<br>reliance on on the physical<br>to a<br>a combined reliance on the print and the<br>physical uh sorry the print and the<br>digital<br>um<br>so you know libraries across the globe<br>during the covid period transform their<br>services<br>to meet<br>the off-campus experiences and some of<br>those are absolutely going to continue<br>so being able to deliver<br>services in a digital way<br>um is an absolute prerequisite for for<br>the future environment and that works<br>both in a physical campus as well as a<br>covered<br>constrained world<br>so the challenges around that are<br>um are actually many there's some<br>technological challenges around ensuring<br>that we have systems um<br>that can deliver the content in the<br>formats that students and academics<br>needs academic needs<br>but also that it has the resilience to<br>uh to be there in uh in the long term so<br>that we're not um<br>putting up information that is going to<br>be difficult to find in the future or<br>we're not going to preserve in the<br>future<br>so examples of using um<br>you know digital objects whether they're<br>images from photographs images of<br>paintings<br>of art images of<br>um archival material whether they're<br>sound recordings or videos<br>we need to ensure that where we should<br>be keeping those for the long term that<br>we've got systems that will allow us to<br>do that digital preservation<br>and that's a big challenge across the<br>globe not just not just in<br>otago<br>but i think there's also the<br>the challenge of providing<br>content from publishers<br>and that's<br>has been a challenge<br>for the whole of my library career over<br>30 years<br>particularly over the last 20 years when<br>publishers have charged<br>increasing prices every year so the<br>inflation on information resources has<br>been<br>in double digits for many years i think<br>in the last probably last five years<br>that's come down to slightly lower<br>levels but it's still unsustainable<br>for universities to be able to afford<br>all of the digital content<br>that we need to provide for research and<br>education<br>um<br>with inflation that's above the level of<br>general inflation<br>so there's a lot of work going on<br>globally around how we can work with<br>publishers to<br>reduce the the cost of information<br>resources<br>but also within universities and<br>libraries in particular to explore<br>different ways of delivering that<br>content<br>so whether that's<br>making publications open access so that<br>there's no cost for the reader<br>or the university to pay for the<br>subscription there might be a cost for<br>publishing<br>but if that can be managed in a better<br>way then that reduces the overall cost<br>to to universities of<br>that content but there are also<br>interesting experiments going on<br>one starting in new zealand around open<br>access textbooks<br>but this is happening globally as well<br>so<br>the states of<br>the education department<br>in the states are providing seven<br>million dollars a year<br>to<br>organizations that want to provide open<br>access textbooks and developing those so<br>there's lots of<br>potential developments happening but we<br>need to see<br>some practical<br>actual examples that will be useful for<br>academics and useful for students<br>in the future<br>thank you i know to a lot of my students<br>and a lot of um<br>academic staff across university just<br>feel so well supported over the past um<br>through the whole covet era and moving a<br>lot of learning online and that couldn't<br>have been done without the support of<br>the libraries and all this stuff so so<br>thank you for that<br>um can i ask a question now about alumni<br>uh can you tell us about what otago<br>library services are available to alumni<br>students after they graduate<br>so the<br>students who are based in<br>dunedin can still use the physical the<br>physical building<br>and there are there is some digital<br>content that they can use if they're<br>physically uh on the premises so our<br>license some of our licenses allow<br>what's called walk-in users<br>we are starting to explore what that<br>might look like um in christchurch and<br>in wellington and in the cargill and<br>indeed in<br>um<br>in auckland for premises that the<br>university has in those on those sites<br>and<br>want to explore whether that walk-in use<br>can be available<br>for alumni<br>as well we also want to explore and<br>understand actually from alumni what um<br>in a bit more detail what would be<br>useful for them so there are some<br>some options within uh licenses for<br>digital content that we could take up if<br>there was demand from alumni<br>for that um<br>one of the other aspects is pointing uh<br>alumni to free content so this open<br>access content and i think that's a<br>a good starting point actually for the<br>university to be thinking about why<br>would we<br>make content<br>uh available open in open access format<br>um<br>the advantage of that it gives access to<br>everybody<br>so not just those in academic<br>institutions<br>wonderful thank you thank you um so i've<br>got two more questions left um<br>this one i'm quite quite keen on because<br>i'm very interested in uh what is sort<br>of our graduate profile of the students<br>as they leave us so from your<br>perspective what's your wish for our<br>graduating students as they go off into<br>um from a i suppose a broader<br>perspective than the library i think<br>it's having students who are um curious<br>and interested and have got experience<br>of<br>um not just academic uh develop their<br>own academic development but have had<br>opportunities to<br>do things outside academia as well so<br>learning skills through volunteering or<br>work experience<br>um whether that's paid internships or um<br>you know volunteering<br>um<br>i think that that rounded sense of<br>um<br>an individual who can contribute to new<br>zealand and uh in particular as a as a<br>country not just economically um<br>but in terms of being a good citizen<br>and i think a library can play a role in<br>develop allowing students to develop<br>skills to<br>interrogate information to<br>you know in this world of fake news to<br>be able to<br>understand how to evaluate information<br>that's presented in this<br>most<br>increasingly complex world information<br>world so having those skills to be able<br>to interrogate that that landscape of<br>the torrent of information that's<br>available<br>and developing that<br>both curiosity curiosity but also the<br>ability to analyze what is credible<br>information<br>well said couldn't agree more<br>finally last question um we haven't<br>talked much about books in fact we<br>haven't talked about any particular book<br>but um what are you reading at the<br>moment<br>um it's a good question i've uh<br>i've just finished um<br>a fiction fiction book by david nichols<br>i'm absolutely terrible at remembering<br>what i've read so<br>i'm not the typical librarian in that in<br>that perspective so<br>um<br>i picked up a book that i thought i'd<br>read from margaret atwood but realized<br>by the halfway through the first page i<br>had actually read it before so<br>um i picked up a book of world history<br>um<br>which was<br>one cents quite a good bedtime reading<br>because it sent me to sleep pretty<br>quickly<br>but did give me an opportunity briefly<br>to see<br>um actually what was this book saying<br>about um<br>new zealand in um you know pre-european<br>um<br>and it makes i think it made me realize<br>just how<br>one-sided<br>most history books are written from a<br>certain perspective<br>and how much more we have to do<br>to understand the uh the longer history<br>of new zealand<br>yeah so that's an example of you like<br>interrogating the text and looking for<br>the truth beyond what was actually just<br>there printed so yeah living up to your<br>own graduate profile<br>generally do you have a favorite author<br>um<br>no i wouldn't say that i wouldn't say<br>that i do<br>i tend to read more<br>non-fiction than fiction um<br>i still<br>will read pretty much anything about<br>cricket in particular which is my<br>my favorite sport although i'm very<br>conscious that<br>well i suppose this is a good time to be<br>talking qriket in new zealand with um<br>just being the world champions<br>deservedly so<br>yeah well very diplomatic of you uh uh<br>mike to say you don't have one favorite<br>author that's probably very apt for a<br>librarian well that brings me um we're<br>at the end now of of our talk so mike<br>thank you so much for joining us i know<br>you're very very busy<br>um and but thank you for taking the time<br>out of your day to have a bit of a chat<br>and um i look forward to meeting you in<br>person sometime i might actually cruise<br>around the library and see if i can find<br>you yeah please do it's really good
