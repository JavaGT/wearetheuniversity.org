uh<br>brought to you by the university of<br>waikato in the waikato management school<br>taro papa<br>as you know from the program ahead of us<br>we have a great couple of days<br>where we're going to be traversing a lot<br>of topics<br>and a world that's frankly facing a lot<br>of challenges on many fronts<br>it's a very strong program<br>unfortunately of course we can't be here<br>face to face but it does mean that we've<br>got a live stream going out to a much<br>broader audience<br>before i hand across to neil quigley the<br>vice chancellor to formally open this<br>forum<br>on the screen where you're watching the<br>live stream<br>please connect with the slido app or the<br>technology you can feed through your<br>questions the moderators over the next<br>two days will be able to see those<br>questions come through<br>and so they'll be able to feed those<br>through to the different panelists we've<br>got over the next two days<br>my name is matt bulger i'm the pro vice<br>chancellor of the waikato management<br>school and i'll be the host over the<br>next two days<br>now to formally open the 2022 new<br>zealand economics forum i'd like to hand<br>over to<br>the vice chancellor of the university of<br>greetings everyone welcome and thank you<br>all for attending the second university<br>of waikato economic forum<br>the current economic environment is very<br>complex and so the discussions in this<br>forum assume a particular importance<br>more so because we have a great lineup<br>of speakers who are in each case both<br>well-known leaders in their field<br>and able to provide a wide range of<br>perspectives on the current economic<br>environment and the challenges that it<br>presents<br>to set the scene i'd like to take just a<br>few minutes to reflect on the complexity<br>of this current environment that we find<br>ourselves in<br>the covert pandemic has created both a<br>demand shock and a supply shock to the<br>economy<br>the demand shocks been managed to a<br>large extent by fiscal policy with<br>large-scale government spending on wage<br>subsidies and investment designed to<br>stimulate economic activity<br>of course the government response has<br>not been costless and in particular<br>public debt has increased substantially<br>the supply shock has reduced our<br>capacity to produce goods and services<br>in some but not all sectors<br>it's particularly apparent in the labor<br>market following the closure of the<br>border<br>and the inability over a two-year period<br>to import both short-term and long-term<br>workers<br>as well as supply chain disruption<br>and of course significant increases in<br>the second area that's particularly<br>noticeable in the economy at present is<br>that there have been significant<br>relative price adjustments over the past<br>two years<br>while<br>some of those price changes are relative<br>domestic and international supply chain<br>disruptions and the closure of the<br>border mean that we face a real danger<br>of inflationary pressure becoming<br>widespread and feeding through into<br>inflationary expectations<br>with consequent implications for wage<br>and salary<br>expectations of course<br>up to this point there's been some<br>upward pressure on non-tradables<br>inflation that is domestic inflation<br>particularly in wage and salary<br>increases but the change<br>has been<br>mostly<br>in tradables inflation<br>remember that we're coming off a decade<br>in which tradables inflation was muted<br>or at times negative<br>and even changes in oil prices were<br>swamped by a wider trend for imported<br>goods and services prices<br>to stay static or in some cases decline<br>at least in nominal terms<br>it's not clear<br>over what period<br>or even if the forces that drove that<br>period of subdued tradable inflation<br>will re-emerge which puts more pressure<br>on our ability to manage<br>gdp in new zealand and our major trading<br>partners is now higher than before the<br>pandemic<br>but while some sectors have done and are<br>doing extremely well<br>in others it certainly does not feel as<br>though we're in the midst of a strong<br>recovery at this point<br>indeed a recovery at all<br>the country's annual trade services<br>balance has gone from an almost 4<br>billion surplus the end of 2019 to an<br>over four billion dollar deficit now an<br>eight billion dollar hole<br>and this has occurred essentially<br>because new zealand has written off two<br>enormous<br>uh foreign exchange earners tourism and<br>international education and of course in<br>those sectors<br>affected by tourism and education<br>the implications of that change are<br>enormous<br>so i'd just like to briefly touch on a<br>few of the implications of this<br>environment and some of the things that<br>you'll be hearing about from our<br>subsequent speakers<br>one topic of conversation will be about<br>our attempts to manage inflation over<br>the next<br>period of time<br>so one of the things we know is that the<br>neutral interest rate at the moment<br>is lower than it was in the past<br>due<br>in significant part to a global glut of<br>savings<br>in addition there's a lot more debt in<br>the markets that will be affected<br>by interest rate movements including of<br>course<br>in relation to mortgages<br>so interest rates probably don't need to<br>move as far as they did in the past to<br>have the required effect uh on dampening<br>inflationary expectations you'll be<br>hearing more about that later in the<br>forum<br>from the governor of the reserve bank<br>labour market shortages<br>are<br>in some mines anticipating to be<br>relieved reasonably quickly with the<br>announcement of the opening of the<br>border<br>but one of the things we know and i see<br>this from the perspective of the<br>education sector<br>is that<br>having<br>had our border closed for two years<br>means that it's not easy for immigration<br>new zealand to quickly turn around<br>to be acting in the way<br>that they were<br>before the covert pandemic hit<br>i think that means that<br>labour market shortages and<br>our ability to bring in international<br>students<br>and other key<br>aspects of our economy<br>are going to take some time<br>to return to what we were used to in the<br>past<br>a further significant area of discussion<br>in the forum which i think is obvious to<br>all of us as a really important<br>issue in our current economy and society<br>is the way in which the covert pandemic<br>all of the price changes and the<br>responses to the pandemic have affected<br>inequality<br>and i think we're all aware of the<br>implications of that<br>particularly as<br>the wealth of those who own houses has<br>increased relative to other people<br>in our society<br>and finally i mentioned<br>the<br>social<br>psychological and political implications<br>of the pandemic and the public health<br>response<br>while<br>in this forum we'll be focused on the<br>economic issues<br>i hope that a future forum will focus on<br>some of those wider implications of the<br>pandemic and our response to it because<br>i think it's apparent to all of us<br>that things in new zealand have changed<br>substantially as a result of the<br>pandemic<br>the way in which people think their<br>attitudes and<br>the way in which we are talking about<br>them<br>have all changed and i think it's really<br>important<br>once we have just a little bit of<br>distance between us and the worst of the<br>pandemic that we have that conversation<br>can i close just by thanking uh the<br>conference organizers for all the work<br>that they've done to pull this together<br>and for their perseverance in having<br>the forum despite the constraints of<br>needing to do it online<br>and to thank all of the speakers<br>for<br>their perseverance and sticking with us<br>as we move to online and being willing<br>to continue to participate<br>we look forward to all of the<br>discussions uh it's a great lineup of<br>speakers and i'm sure it's going to be a<br>very lively discussion uh thanks to all<br>of you once again for uh joining us at<br>thank you<br>so i'm joined here by a special guest<br>for the next two days uh stephen joyce<br>former minister of finance former<br>minister of many things uh it's great to<br>have you here so as you know we've got a<br>big program ahead you'll be moderating<br>several of the sessions yourself we're<br>touching on everything from<br>uh health education maori economy uh<br>traditional fear of monetary and fiscal<br>policy what are the big themes that<br>you're looking at over the next couple<br>of days well i think um<br>we've almost operating at about two<br>levels here we're we're actually dealing<br>with the uh economic<br>uh issues in each sector so you've got<br>the health sector which you know we know<br>has got big challenges education sector<br>the maori economy<br>business more generally so we're dealing<br>with those and a lot of those today and<br>then we're also dealing with the<br>macroeconomic which sort of is over the<br>top of everything and neil as neil<br>mentioned we're dealing with the<br>inflation challenges<br>which are out in front of us frankly i<br>think at this point so we have tomorrow<br>we have a we have a panel with monetary<br>policy we also have the reserve ban<br>governor tomorrow fresh out of the<br>monetary policy statement on wednesday<br>so he'll be very interesting fiscal<br>policy as well tomorrow and of course<br>you're about to have treasury secretary<br>carlea mcleish as well<br>who will no doubt have her views on<br>where we're at and how we're going so<br>i'm looking forward to it i think<br>it's really important to have these<br>conversations at a time like this where<br>we have a lot of force change caused by<br>firstly the pandemic but there's other<br>events in the world of course ukraine<br>and so on uh and it's important we make<br>that as wider dialogue as possible so<br>i'd encourage everybody to to get in and<br>uh and ask their questions uh that the<br>moderators are all ready to to to have<br>those questions and air those questions<br>with the presenters and we're going to<br>have as much of a two-way conversation<br>over the next two days as possible uh<br>with the technology which is pretty good<br>brilliant thank you steven so a timely<br>reminder please do<br>look at that slido app and get the<br>questions coming through they'll appear<br>on a screen for us here in the studio<br>uh big morning we're about to be joined<br>by dr carly mcleish<br>followed by a session on health and then<br>former prime minister the right<br>honourable helen clark will join us then<br>on through the afternoon so a fantastic<br>day ahead<br>without any further ado i am going to<br>introduce our first speaker so we're<br>joined now by dr carolee mcclish<br>she heads new zealand's treasury as<br>secretary and chief executive comes from<br>a background leading treasury functions<br>in australia and earlier in her career<br>had worked in washington dc at the world<br>bank<br>also at the international red cross and<br>at boston consulting group so a long<br>distinguished career<br>we now hand over to you carolee and<br>we'll see if the technology works and<br>thank you uh thank you very much matt<br>antenna<br>thank you for the the opportunity to<br>join you today and uh and to our host at<br>the university of waikato for bringing<br>us together it's a great occasion i'll<br>just move to sharing my screen<br>presentation<br>yes<br>very good so<br>this morning i would like to make a few<br>observations on the economy which has<br>been resilient thanks to the strong<br>economic and health response to covert<br>but we are seeing some shorter-term<br>issues around capacity inflation as well<br>as longer term issues including a higher<br>debt position<br>so how do we address these what are the<br>trade-offs we face and three goals of<br>fiscal policy<br>improving living standards macroeconomic<br>stability and fiscal sustainability<br>so so with those questions in mind<br>um what i'd like to do is outline some<br>of the three big choices<br>that uh new zealand faces around fiscal<br>policy<br>so let's start with the economy and how<br>the treasury's saying that<br>we're now in year three of the pandemic<br>covert 19 has caused some few disruption<br>in some sectors and for some businesses<br>and people<br>but overall the economy has proven<br>resilient to date<br>we've seen unprecedented volatility and<br>quarterly gdp<br>as you can see here but overall the<br>level of economic activity is now<br>starting to approach the creek over<br>trend and it's also stronger than in<br>many other advanced economies<br>government spending monetary policy have<br>played central roles in this resilience<br>among the really remarkable aspects of<br>the covert 19 downturn is the nature of<br>the supply shocks<br>lockdowns shut both production and<br>consumption in many industries and<br>subsequent catch-up production has not<br>been possible in the same way as<br>catch-up demand<br>in addition the availability of workers<br>has been impacted by border restrictions<br>global supply chains have been severely<br>disrupted which is constraining<br>businesses ability to meet demand<br>but the resilience of the economy and<br>the tightness of supply are especially<br>evident in labor markets so we've seen<br>unemployment under utilization at the<br>low pre-pandemic levels across all<br>ethnicities as well as for women and<br>youth although existing disparities do<br>remain<br>importantly participation in the labor<br>force is held up unlike some other<br>advanced countries<br>border restrictions have contributed to<br>the tight labour market as industries<br>experiencing skills shortages have been<br>less able to access international<br>workers<br>but in some cases water restrictions<br>have cushioned the bloat of the labor<br>market<br>for example while retail accommodation<br>experienced some of the highest falls in<br>uh in employment in the two years to<br>last december<br>this is offset by the falls and working<br>holiday visa holders that comprise about<br>a quarter of the jobs and alcohol and<br>combination of food services<br>so resilient demand combined with<br>interrupted supply has brought<br>inflationary pressures<br>inflation has risen overseas for similar<br>reasons and global inflation is also<br>impacting new zealand with fuel prices<br>being the greatest driver of inflation<br>as you can see here<br>at the onset of covert 19 central banks<br>in new zealand and overseas reduced<br>interest rates<br>this supported consumption and<br>employment and it also boosted asset<br>prices exacerbating wealth inequalities<br>between those with<br>and without assets<br>with inflation on the rise central banks<br>in new zealand and overseas have either<br>started lifting interest rates or signal<br>that they will and this will have a<br>dampening effect on asset prices<br>in new zealand we've already seen the<br>housing market start to slow which we're<br>forecast to continue<br>we're expecting inflation to peak in<br>march 22 and ease over the coming years<br>as conditions normalize<br>while the economy over overall has been<br>surprisingly resilient kobit 19 has<br>driven some real shifts in the economy's<br>structure<br>some of which have fueled inflation as<br>relative prices change<br>you can see here a breakdown of economic<br>growth that shows government consumption<br>playing a really strong role in<br>supporting demand<br>residential investment and to a lesser<br>extent private consumption have also<br>grown strongly supported by rising house<br>prices<br>imports exports and services have fallen<br>dramatically of course alongside the<br>lack of international travel and so<br>businesses that are reliant on overseas<br>tourists or students are really<br>struggling<br>new zealanders have also substituted<br>away from services into consuming<br>durable goods<br>people are buying new cars and kitchens<br>instead of taking their overseas<br>holidays<br>and that same switch from services to<br>goods is happening globally which is<br>boosting commodity prices our key<br>exporters are experiencing uh high<br>prices for their products and in terms<br>of trade are at their highest in more<br>than 100 years<br>consumer spending we also see shifts<br>there from in-person to online and the<br>increase in working from home has<br>changed consumption patterns within<br>cities<br>but despite all this disruption and all<br>these really significant shifts we don't<br>see evidence of widespread scarring to<br>date<br>and some of the longer-term trends that<br>new zealand has has faced have persisted<br>such as growing terms of trade<br>and low productivity growth<br>today we're facing into rising cases of<br>the omicron variant it's disrupting both<br>demand and supply through worker<br>absences and individual efforts to avoid<br>illness rather than by lockdowns<br>our analysis at treasury suggests that<br>omicron will reduce march quarter gdp by<br>about one and a half to percentage<br>points<br>however um international experience<br>suggests that omicron waves speak<br>quickly and that economic activity<br>rebounds relatively rapidly<br>so pandemic has shown us time and again<br>how quickly the outlook can shame can<br>change<br>main uncertainty continues to be covered<br>19 but new zealand remains in a strong<br>position to withstand some of the risks<br>and challenges ahead<br>with among the most robust economic<br>performance in advanced countries<br>through the pandemic but also<br>low levels of government debt relative<br>to uh relative to peers<br>so that takes me to<br>my next part of this presentation fiscal<br>policy<br>so fiscal policy has played a central<br>role in the resilience of the economy<br>through the pandemic to date<br>wage subsidy other economic supports<br>have helped keep people and jobs and<br>businesses running funding enabled an<br>effective health response and increases<br>to benefits and other welfare spend have<br>supported vulnerable people<br>new zealand had one of the largest and<br>also the most timely fiscal responses<br>among event among advanced economies<br>this was made easier by crown balance<br>sheet strong current crown balance sheet<br>entering into the pandemic<br>um support which was supported by firm<br>commitment across successive governments<br>over many years to fiscal sustainability<br>debt has risen dramatically although the<br>increase is uh close to the ocd average<br>and far less than originally predicted<br>as you can see here<br>thanks largely to the resilience of the<br>economy<br>um back at the start of the pandemic<br>treasury's view was that the choices for<br>fiscal policy were relatively clear<br>given the extreme nature of the shock a<br>swift and strong fiscal report response<br>was required<br>the risks of providing too little<br>support when it was needed<br>far outweighed providing too much<br>support if not needed<br>but looking ahead the choices for fiscal<br>policy entail a more considered balance<br>across the three key goals of fiscal<br>policy<br>improving living standards<br>macroeconomic stability and fiscal<br>sustainability<br>so as mentioned at the start i wanted to<br>highlight three areas where governments<br>based choices in setting fiscal policy<br>that we believe are particularly<br>relevant for the period ahead and noting<br>also that they're not exhausted of<br>course<br>so these are the weight that's placed on<br>macroeconomic stability versus other<br>living standards<br>objectives prudent debt versus for<br>investment<br>and fiscal versus other government<br>policies<br>i'll outline briefly the ways in which<br>treasury aims to surface the trade-offs<br>that are inherent in these choices in<br>our advice to ministers who are of<br>course ultimately responsible for<br>weighing the options and making<br>decisions<br>so first<br>weight place on macroeconomic stability<br>objectives so that the main focus of<br>fiscal policy is raising revenue<br>allocating spending in a way that lifts<br>living standards<br>fiscal policy enables short-term<br>long-term investments in schools<br>hospitals roads social environmental<br>services and essential infrastructure<br>for example<br>macroeconomic conditions such as<br>inflation state of the labor america<br>exchange rates they also matter in<br>setting fiscal policy but they're only<br>one factor and need to be balanced<br>against other objectives<br>governments have choices about balancing<br>macroeconomic conditions now with<br>shaping long-term well-being later<br>main policy tool for managing economic<br>cycles is monetary policy<br>fiscal policy has an important<br>supporting role though particularly<br>through automatic stabilizers that help<br>to make economic cycles less pronounced<br>and as we've seen through the pandemic<br>fiscal policy can also be really<br>effective in supporting living standards<br>by holding up activity in the face of<br>significant shocks<br>and by targeting those who are most<br>affected<br>but that said an excessive short-term<br>stabilization focus for discretionary<br>fiscal policy could lead to frequent<br>changes in spending and tax program<br>which<br>which in turn could impose microeconomic<br>costs<br>moreover given various lags that are<br>inherent in discretionary fiscal policy<br>outside emergency spending there's also<br>a real risk that attempts at<br>stabilization actually end up<br>exacerbating the economic cycle<br>fiscal policy can of course contribute<br>to inflation for any given level of<br>activity physical stimulus will add to<br>demand and that puts pressure on prices<br>a few important points of clarification<br>though first demand is boosted by fiscal<br>stimulus not just spending we need to<br>look at revenue also<br>second the extent of any effect on<br>stimulus on inflation will depend on the<br>nature and the timing of spending and<br>finally we need to look also the supply<br>side of the economy if an increase in<br>demand were accompanied by an increase<br>in supply we would expect growth not<br>inflation<br>so what does this mean for fiscal policy<br>today when inflation is high while the<br>extent of fiscal stimulus has been very<br>large the treasury's last forecast show<br>fiscal tightening from june this year<br>with a return to surplus by 2024 and a<br>negative fiscal impulse from next year<br>onwards<br>so that reflects the wind down of<br>economic supports that were temporary by<br>design<br>and also solid revenue growth offset by<br>significant allowances to achieve<br>government's budget objectives which<br>include tackling climate change and and<br>health reform<br>economic supports are still available<br>through the pandemic but they're more<br>targeted now and aimed at avoiding<br>scarring rather than the broader support<br>for demand that was provided earlier<br>net effect is that fiscal policy is<br>dampening pressure on inflation in the<br>coming years uh while the treasury's<br>forecasting inflation to remain above<br>the rbnz target range through 2022 for<br>the next couple of years fiscal policy<br>is not the main factor driving this<br>now of course there are options about<br>the speed the extent of fiscal<br>tightening interactions with monetary<br>policy are relevant to these choices<br>any government spending is expected to<br>add to demand relative to not spending<br>and will require a greater monetary<br>policy response than otherwise<br>fiscal multipliers are also higher when<br>rates are low<br>but with interest rates close to the<br>effect of lower bound fiscal policy may<br>support monetary policy in normalizing<br>and enable further headroom for future<br>downturns<br>ultimately the balance of these<br>macroeconomic and microeconomic<br>objectives are choices for the<br>government of the day and our role at<br>the treasury is to help inform these<br>decisions by making clear those<br>trade-offs<br>now the second<br>choice that i wanted to speak about was<br>between prudent debt and prudent<br>investment<br>so concept of prudent debt was<br>introduced in new zealand's legislation<br>through the fiscal responsibility act<br>back in 1994 part of a series of public<br>finance reforms that are that are<br>internationally renowned for promoting<br>fiscal discipline and performance<br>the the authors didn't define prudence<br>and instead they gave governments the<br>flexibility to interpret the principles<br>of responsible fiscal management in the<br>economic context of the time<br>so there's really no magic number for<br>optimal debt<br>as treasury advised back in 1994 it<br>varies with the circumstances<br>our view at the treasury today is that<br>today's level and trajectory of debt is<br>brilliant and consistent with the<br>principles of responsible fiscal<br>management<br>fiscal framework is enduring but um but<br>the context has changed<br>we examine three main factors in<br>determining prudent debt so debt<br>sustainability market access and the<br>welfare or well-being vex offer of debt<br>and you know just looking at context<br>network net core crown debt reached its<br>peak of 55<br>of gdp in 1992 that was shortly before<br>the uh the fra fiscal responsibility act<br>was passed and at that time a long-term<br>objective of net debt at 20 to 30<br>percent of gdp was established as you<br>can see here<br>you can also see here just how different<br>the context was at that time with crown<br>facing negative net worth low ratings<br>credit ratings and uh much higher<br>interest rates<br>and by contrast<br>as the treasury advises now on<br>post pandemic debt targets<br>debt servicing sustainability and market<br>access considerations are completely<br>different<br>the decline that you can see here in<br>debt costs reflects a uh a longer term<br>trend of falling neutral interest rates<br>the result is that interest rates are<br>lower than growth rates<br>which is a condition of considerable<br>importance to fiscal policy it reduces<br>the welfare cost of debt and um it<br>creates what creates more physical<br>headroom<br>now<br>we can't be certain that these favorable<br>debt dynamics will continue indefinitely<br>in the near term of course rates are<br>expected to rise as monetary policy<br>normalizes but falling neutral interest<br>rates is a global trend it reflects uh<br>strong savings with investment driven by<br>and while not unanimous the general<br>consensus is that these long-term forces<br>are unlikely to reverse and neutral<br>interest rates will remain will remain<br>low<br>so so an important point that i'd like<br>to stress is that prudent debt is also<br>inextricably inextricably linked with<br>the concept of brilliant investment<br>which captures the welfare or well-being<br>effects of spending<br>while lower debt targets can enhance<br>short-term fiscal sustainability set too<br>low they risk ineffective inefficient<br>cuts in public investment or increases<br>in taxation that can reduce overall<br>well-being and conversely debt limits<br>that are set too high can impose costs<br>on future generations or lead to<br>wasteful spend<br>there is some evidence that investment<br>has been below proven levels uh te<br>wahinga the new zealand infrastructure<br>commission have estimated a historical<br>infrastructure gap of 104 billion<br>dollars<br>for many years new zealand's capital<br>intensity has been below the oecd<br>average and one of the drivers of poor<br>productivity performance<br>higher rates of both private and public<br>investment are likely to be critical to<br>achieving objectives around new<br>zealand's long-standing challenges<br>such as housing climate change and<br>productivity<br>the two are closely related there's<br>international evidence that additional<br>public investment can catalyze private<br>investment<br>and increase certainty about the path of<br>public investment can also allow<br>industries like construction to plan and<br>prepare for higher levels of activity<br>but striking the right balance between<br>prudent debt and investment depends<br>critically on the rigor<br>and the enforcement of public investment<br>disciplines<br>more credible the investment framework<br>the better the ability to identify uh<br>value from money proposals and then the<br>less there is a need for blunt and<br>restrictive debt targets<br>without these disciplines there is a<br>risk that looser debt targets could lead<br>to wasteful spend<br>so choices on prudent debt and prudent<br>investment also require close attention<br>to rules on operating spending<br>the treasury's long-term fiscal<br>statement<br>shows that if historical trends continue<br>the greatest risks to debt<br>sustainability are from rising<br>superannuation costs and health<br>expenditure as you can see here<br>ensuring that operating expenses are<br>covered by operating revenue helps to<br>ensure intergenerational equity<br>it means that the current generation<br>pays for its own consumption and debt<br>can be used for investments that provide<br>returns to future generations<br>treasury is currently examining how<br>fiscal indicators can set the right<br>incentives for both prudent debt and<br>investment<br>for example in measures of net debt the<br>treatment of monetary policy financial<br>assets and crown entities can affect<br>the incentives on the direction of<br>fiscal policy and also how resources are<br>allocated<br>and what's clear is that there's there's<br>no one perfect fiscal target any targets<br>need to be considered along a<br>comprehensive suite of fiscal<br>performance measures that are embedded<br>in a broader and rigorous fiscal<br>framework<br>that takes me to the third trade-off<br>which is<br>the weight placed on fiscal versus other<br>policies so government has a wide set of<br>tools available<br>fiscal regulatory social policies and<br>and careful consideration is needed on<br>which tools to use when<br>i touch briefly on some of the<br>interactions of monetary and fiscal<br>policy earlier but more broadly in<br>setting fiscal policy we always need to<br>check whether alternatives can achieve<br>the policy objective more effectively<br>in many instances and particularly where<br>affordability and macroeconomic concerns<br>are high non-fiscal levers can provide<br>more attractive options for achieving<br>government's objectives<br>look i think new zealand's climate<br>policy response provides an example of<br>assessing healthy school and other<br>policy tools can be leveraged alongside<br>one another<br>global climate change represents uh<br>what's been termed as the greatest<br>market failure the world has ever seen<br>those who emit greenhouse gases have not<br>paid for the full cost of the emissions<br>and correcting this through price<br>signals on emissions is our first best<br>solution and uh and one that we stand<br>strongly behind at the treasury<br>but there are um reasons why emissions<br>pricing cannot be the only tool in in<br>our climate policy toolbox<br>while emissions pricing corrects for one<br>key failure there are more to be<br>addressed such as imperfect information<br>asymmetric information in complete<br>markets<br>consumer behavior<br>and<br>in addition at present the emissions<br>trading scheme our core emissions<br>pricing instrument in new zealand<br>doesn't cover all sectors and our<br>businesses in the economy<br>so given this<br>price mechanisms are necessary but not<br>enough complementary regulatory other<br>non-spending measures alongside value<br>for money spending measures are needed<br>to achieve our emissions goals at<br>minimum cost<br>moreover complementary measures may be<br>used to support equity in a climate<br>transition or achieve other social goals<br>ultimately a choice of how to use these<br>levers comes down to assessing a number<br>of trade-offs and requires consideration<br>of<br>efficiency equity broader distributional<br>concerns from<br>economic perspectives but also social<br>cultural and environmental perspectives<br>and the treasury's living standards<br>framework helps us to assess some of<br>so in closing then while the economy has<br>proven resilient to date uh covert<br>response policies have involved some<br>really tough trade-offs<br>as we as we continue to navigate the<br>pandemic and look ahead to recovery<br>choices and trade-offs for fiscal policy<br>will persist<br>they require considered balance across<br>the goals of improving living standards<br>macroeconomic stability and fiscal<br>sustainability<br>there are no simple answers here we need<br>to weigh<br>costs and benefits<br>we don't know yet what the next shock<br>will be but we must evaluate the lessons<br>from the pandemic response to help us<br>navigate what will be inevitable shocks<br>and changes ahead<br>we also seek to understand the effects<br>of economic policy not just on the<br>fiscal and traditional economic measures<br>as i've mainly focused on today but also<br>broader measures of living standards and<br>later this year the treasury is going to<br>release its first well-being report<br>which is a new stewardship requirement<br>under the public finance act that that<br>asked us to examine the state the trends<br>and the underlying drivers of wellbeing<br>in new zealand and we look forward to<br>engaging with<br>academics others in the economic<br>profession hopefully members of the<br>audience here on this important work<br>so thank you i will close there and uh<br>thank you<br>and uh some fascinating looks back<br>particularly of the contrast between now<br>and the the 90s where we went through so<br>many policy changes<br>can i<br>start i guess with the reflection there<br>are a lot of challenges coming at us and<br>there are also a lot of reforms in play<br>for those sitting outside<br>of the the mechanics of of government<br>what is the role of treasury in<br>doing the cost benefit analysis and<br>weighing the trade-offs you've really<br>dwelt in those trade-offs<br>and how is that happening now with<br>simply so many different things in play<br>versus analysis happening on<br>reforms with within one industry house<br>how's treasury's role in that<br>yeah yeah thanks thanks for that<br>question and there certainly is a very<br>large reform agenda as well as the<br>response to the code of pandemic and<br>treasury is a central agency is really<br>involved in uh in almost every aspect of<br>that in some way but i think it<br>importantly<br>um is a responsibility of uh of agencies<br>who are preparing policy proposals to<br>to really develop the analysis on those<br>choices the trade-offs the costs and the<br>benefits<br>treasury has a supporting role<br>and we<br>prepare guidelines and frameworks and<br>we'll work with agencies to uh to<br>conduct those sorts of assessments but<br>really the the<br>the responsibility lies where the<br>expertise also lies as well<br>treasury through the budget process will<br>have a really critical role in<br>providing our assessment on<br>policy proposals<br>and not doing bottom-up cost-benefit<br>analysis ourselves but reviewing uh what<br>what the proposals are and analysis<br>that's been that's been done we provide<br>that second opinion advice to uh to to<br>to government we also have a roles group<br>providing that second opinion advice<br>through the cabinet process for<br>regulatory proposals um or other funding<br>planning proposals<br>we are increasingly using our living<br>standards framework to uh help assess um<br>proposals that come through so that we<br>can identify some of the trade-offs that<br>i spoke about um today and we also work<br>with agencies to encourage use to the<br>living standards framework as well as<br>more traditional<br>ways to assess policy choices and<br>trade-offs<br>great thank you<br>i'm going to go to a question that's<br>come through from the audience so<br>the comment was that treasury had<br>previously advised that the reserve bank<br>should consider<br>broadening broadening the monetary<br>policy committee to allow academic<br>experts or others to serve is that a<br>current view of treasury or have you got<br>a view on that now<br>i'm sorry on the appointments of the<br>monetary policy committee of the<br>committee here<br>on the membership of the bank<br>so um you know we haven't given advice<br>on this recently but um but we haven't<br>changed our view and i'm aware that<br>there are no appointment processes that<br>are underway so we wouldn't want to<br>comment on that<br>but no we haven't<br>that's that's fine and that's one one<br>through from the audience can i then ask<br>another one<br>the<br>looking ahead particularly you've got<br>the living standards framework you've<br>touched on many things including climate<br>change and other issues<br>where do you see the best investments<br>being from a government point of view<br>that are going to meet<br>needs around commercial you know growth<br>of the economy but also the social and<br>environmental needs what are the what<br>are the items that you see are the<br>greatest opportunity for greater<br>investment over the next five years<br>oh um that's a great question and a very<br>broad one um there are there are many i<br>mean i think one of the biggest<br>transitions well without doubt one of<br>the biggest transitions ahead of the<br>country is climate change<br>uh and so investments that support um<br>climate resilient uh economy and uh low<br>emissions economy will be absolutely<br>critical i think there are big<br>opportunities as well as uh the costs of<br>transition um new zealand already has<br>great advantages in its<br>high use of renewable energy and a lot<br>of sustainable agricultural practices<br>uh and so you know that that shift to um<br>to climate friendly investments is one<br>that i just see is a big opportunity<br>but it's also an imperative and that<br>will be driving a lot of allocation of<br>resources in the economy uh overall<br>i think there are also opportunities in<br>rebuilding and deepening our<br>international connections<br>uh we know that that's a critical<br>element of driving productivity in<br>new zealand and as border restrictions<br>eat<br>there will be there will be many<br>opportunities that come from<br>strengthening those uh those channels<br>with the export markets<br>and also the exchange of people and<br>technologies and ideas that can support<br>uh support productivity and i guess the<br>final one that i'd highlight is just the<br>infrastructure um<br>infrastructure investment<br>government has significantly increased<br>funding for for infrastructure<br>um and i mentioned in my remarks the uh<br>the the measures of the infrastructure<br>gap now infrastructure you know the<br>right projects can also really drive<br>productivity there's a lot of work<br>that's underway in coordinating<br>infrastructure programs and the<br>infrastructure commission of course<br>is building up its uh national<br>infrastructure strategy to really help<br>focus<br>investments on where they can best lift<br>the productivity under the standards of<br>new zealanders<br>thank you carolee<br>another question that's come through<br>from the audience and it was<br>specifically about<br>whether and how treasury is thinking<br>about the potential of flow on shocks<br>from what's happening in europe at the<br>moment<br>tensions around russia and ukraine and i<br>might broaden that out to say<br>given the the pandemic shock that we've<br>been through over the last couple of<br>years there are obviously other things<br>that could be happening geopolitically<br>given the<br>the data you've shared with us today<br>around debt and resilience what's your<br>take on our preparedness for<br>other shocks or a potential sequence of<br>shocks over the next few years how do we<br>think about that or how does treasury<br>think about that<br>yeah thanks for the question i think<br>that's a great one<br>this is one of the things that we're<br>reflecting on as we um as we consider<br>how to evaluate some of the lessons from<br>the pandemic<br>is resilience how do we make sure that<br>we um we really capture<br>some of some of what we've learned and<br>ensure that we're ready for the next<br>shock which we know will happen and so<br>we've learned a lot about economic<br>supports and how to deliver those within<br>the treasury but also the interactions<br>of various um different policies and the<br>pandemic was health and economic policy<br>fiscal monetary policy<br>many more regulatory policies are<br>important but really trying to<br>understand those interactions will put<br>us in a better better stead form on<br>whatever shots come next uh on ukraine<br>look this is um this is uh something<br>that a treasury economics team are<br>monitoring it's an issue that treasury<br>economics team are monitoring uh closely<br>the tensions present they do present a<br>risk to the global economic outlook and<br>we've seen some volatility in um in in<br>global markets<br>um there's some risks around uh around<br>uh oil and and fuel prices and we've<br>already seen uh some of that uh<br>take it take effect um and uh present<br>more potential disruptions to uh to<br>supply chains<br>um which again may have uh impacts for<br>uh for inflation for the inflation um<br>outlook so it's an issue that we're<br>monitoring um closely new zealand isn't<br>heavily exposed at this at this point<br>but um no it's it's something that will<br>continue to keep close to handsome<br>thank you<br>i'm gonna ask another one from the<br>audience uh you shared some data there<br>around<br>changes in trade and drop-offs and<br>exports and imports and so on certainly<br>migration of people there was a question<br>that came through about<br>given the impacts of covet should the<br>government be considering should new<br>zealand be considering more national<br>production in case of uh rolling<br>pandemics rolling disruptions in the<br>supply chain over time<br>yeah and i think that comes to the<br>previous question about economic<br>resilience this is an element that um<br>that we in countries around the world<br>are considering we saw particularly the<br>early stages of the pandemic to some<br>really severe disruptions<br>um that uh that<br>exposed i guess the um<br>the the risks um that are inherent in um<br>in some of those international um<br>connections so diversification of uh<br>supply chains and diversification of<br>markets is something um to to explore it<br>is one of the reflections on uh<br>from the pandemic so we're feeding that<br>into some of our work on longer term uh<br>resilience<br>you know there are always trade-offs um<br>no when there are some short-term gains<br>to be made from<br>focusing in on certain markets or<br>certain suppliers that's that that makes<br>it challenging but we have learned that<br>that too much reliance<br>can<br>can increase risk<br>all right thank you<br>and another one<br>perennial topic he touched on the<br>revenue side of the equation<br>what's uh what thinking's being done<br>about tax at the moment taxes<br>as an incentive tax as<br>a driver of productivity and potentially<br>and also is a source of revenue to<br>manage debt of course um what's what's<br>been happening within the the halls of<br>treasury recently and the discussions<br>about tax<br>yeah so i mean tax of course that's<br>always an issue that treasury is uh<br>thinking about and um and doing some<br>work on the most significant work<br>recently was through the tax working<br>group a couple of years ago and um<br>proposals and responses by treasury at<br>the time really outline our thinking on<br>that i mean you can also see um our<br>thinking in some of our work in the um<br>in the long-term fiscal statement which<br>we uh released last year and explored<br>tax options to uh to address some of the<br>long-term fiscal sustainability um<br>challenges that uh that we face<br>back to my theme it is about trade-offs<br>um<br>you know the the the benefits of higher<br>taxes for um fiscal sustainability as<br>opposed to some of the uh welfare costs<br>that can be uh imposed and it really is<br>one of the key areas where<br>where policy comes down to choices for<br>government weighing up those are those<br>different factors but our work is really<br>trying to you know outline the analysis<br>on what the the costs and benefits are<br>of those choices um and as i said the<br>the most significant what we've done<br>recently on that is is summarized in our<br>kia ora thank you<br>right look we've uh we've reached our<br>time so i will wrap us up carolee thank<br>you so much for your time i know you and<br>the team obviously have a uh<br>a lot of things in place so i appreciate<br>your time with us today<br>i'm going to take us to a very short<br>break now<br>we will break for<br>30 40 seconds and then we'll be cutting<br>across to a panel on health and steven<br>joyce will be facilitating an excellent<br>discussion on health and the many issues<br>there so thanks again to carly and we'll<br>see you very soon<br>this<br>welcome back from the treasury view to<br>the first deep dive into one of our<br>sectors<br>um that we're examining as part of<br>investigating the long uh the the<br>impacts of covert over the longer term<br>and of course the biggest area of<br>government investment in the country is<br>the health sector<br>and so we have a panel now which<br>examines some of the issues that have<br>been challenging the health sector and<br>it's been buffeted by<br>a number of uh of trends firstly<br>obviously covert itself<br>and the challenge of preparing and and<br>coping with such a large public health<br>emergency<br>then of course you have the effect of<br>the<br>delay and a whole lot of normal health<br>activity and by that i mean electives<br>diagnostics operations all those things<br>which were normally would be taking<br>place while the uh health sector has<br>been in this state of uh emergency if<br>you like<br>the third area that it's being buffeted<br>is of course the borders where the<br>health workforce a lot of which comes<br>from overseas has been<br>buffeted<br>has been unable to come into the country<br>uh and that has created some supply<br>challenges there and then in the fourth<br>uh uh if you like of the of the four<br>horses of the challenge to the health<br>sector is uh is the reforms that the<br>government is uh<br>is seeking to introduce and will be<br>introducing later this year<br>uh the large-scale<br>operational reforms of the health sector<br>uh that are taking place at this time<br>during this pandemic<br>to discuss all these this morning with<br>me i have three excellent speakers<br>firstly we have professor robin gould<br>who's the dean and pro vice chancellor<br>of the otago business school and has a<br>lot of experience in health economics uh<br>we're about to be joined by des gorman<br>uh the emeritus professor of medicine<br>university of auckland uh very long and<br>distinguished career in the health<br>sector uh including areas like workforce<br>and acc<br>and ranjana patel who's the co-founder<br>and director of tamaki health now you<br>may not have heard of tamaki health but<br>it is the largest independent uh primary<br>care uh<br>primary clear set of clinics in the<br>country uh 300 000 patients particularly<br>prominent in south auckland and the<br>aucklandis so that's our panel we have a<br>total of 45 minutes we're going to put<br>the pressure on the panel and skip the<br>talk for 5 to 10 minutes to lay out<br>their stall if you like and then we're<br>going to have the conversation after<br>that so please get your questions ready<br>the first panelist joining us is<br>professor robin gould<br>robin thank you very much for joining us<br>and uh appreciate your your opening<br>comments<br>thank you very very much stephen for<br>your introduction and i just want to say<br>it's a real privilege to be here at the<br>ncaa economic forum and to be an invited<br>panelist<br>it's a really really impressive event<br>you've put together so congratulations<br>to the waikato management school for for<br>what you've achieved and bringing us<br>together today and in very challenging<br>circumstances<br>um<br>so just just uh to overview what i was<br>going to talk about the next couple of<br>minutes also a little bit of history<br>uh then a few words about the health nz<br>reforms themselves which as stephen has<br>said<br>are imminent<br>uh and then some really really important<br>questions<br>that are yet to be uh broached in terms<br>of those reforms which will have in my<br>view a very real impact on the way in<br>which they are implemented uh and on<br>whether the government is able to<br>achieve the goals that has set down for<br>those reforms<br>underpinning of this of course uh is an<br>institutional<br>perspective and by institutions those<br>are the underlying arrangements<br>and mechanisms<br>uh which sit uh within the healthcare<br>system in this country and in any care<br>system globally<br>so if we just roll the clock back to<br>1938<br>to the social security act which was<br>passed<br>uh by the first labor government<br>with the goal of healthcare<br>of um<br>health being a fundamental right with<br>all having equal<br>access to health care and the same<br>standard of treatment regardless of<br>socioeconomic status or of location<br>around the country<br>services being universally available<br>no access barriers such as financial<br>barriers a preventive rather than<br>curative focus on the health care system<br>and then services being integrated not<br>fragmented between primary and<br>hospital-based care<br>great goals and when you think today<br>about healthcare these are the sorts of<br>goals that governments right around the<br>world are focusing on<br>so quite visionary but what we then had<br>was a period through which the british<br>medical association new zealand branch<br>which evolved into the new zealand<br>medical association<br>um really stood up and resisted<br>this this legislation albeit having been<br>passed through parliament<br>and what what they argued was that um<br>there needed to be uh<br>an ability to maintain private practice<br>to charge patients a fee for service<br>uh and so forth and so over a period of<br>a couple of years a compromise was<br>reached between the government<br>and the medical profession and that laid<br>down the institutional arrangements that<br>primary care<br>certainly up until very recently being<br>dominated by private<br>practice<br>and<br>secondary care and ability for the<br>specialists who would be paid on on<br>salary along with all other hospital<br>staff<br>uh able to take up a private practice as<br>well and so those are the arrangements<br>we have in place today of<br>dual practice as it's called globally in<br>the secondary care sector and then a<br>sort of a privately dominated certainly<br>historically but less so recently<br>in primary care<br>and so this has led to a what you might<br>call quite compartmentalized healthcare<br>system when you think about these<br>different institutional arrangements<br>that sit across the sector and then<br>quite a lot of very intractable<br>questions which governments over the<br>years have sought to solve<br>and and that has led to<br>what i call pastry archi<br>which has been an inability of<br>governments to dig into these underlying<br>institutional arrangements and then<br>instead try and sort of paste on top of<br>those arrangements different operational<br>uh structures and so the most recent<br>version of that is the healthy nz<br>reforms so if there's one thing you take<br>away today it's pastry it's pasting of<br>policy solutions on top of underlying<br>institutions<br>and so um on to the health nz reforms<br>um<br>i i<br>in my view<br>one needs to take a really really long<br>term view of these reforms as one needs<br>to take with any<br>set of reforms certainly in the<br>healthcare sector which arguably is one<br>of the most complex components of public<br>policy and of government<br>in any country and so one needs to take<br>a very very long term<br>view especially when you have fairly<br>rigid<br>institutional arrangements that<br>underlay uh the reforms that are being<br>set and trained<br>the um<br>key challenges with the reforms and and<br>the reforms themselves what we're going<br>to see of course is uh the district<br>health boards being absorbed into health<br>new zealand as a as a preliminary<br>arrangement as they start to move into<br>the um<br>actioning of the reforms the maori<br>health authority will come into play<br>the primary health organizations will<br>effectively become defunct but continue<br>to function in some shape or form as<br>they seek to evolve into becoming what's<br>known as locality<br>networks and so these are<br>what you might call horizontally<br>integrated groups where you would have<br>say general practices and in other<br>primary healthcare services uh<br>integrated with various social services<br>there's nothing much new in this<br>governments over at least the last 20<br>years plus have been seeking to get this<br>sort of horizontal integration happening<br>between social services and<br>health services<br>that<br>so integration is a good thing and the<br>government's quite focused on<br>integration but if you look closely at<br>the health nz reforms and the various<br>presentations being given by the health<br>reforms unit<br>uh there is a quite there is a<br>separation between health nz funding the<br>public hospitals the former district<br>health boards<br>uh and then funding the locality<br>networks the primary care and so in my<br>view what's really needed is a mechanism<br>for vertical integration so that's<br>integration between the primary and the<br>hospital<br>sector and i don't see<br>much prospect for that happening<br>certainly in the short term<br>and that's because of the<br>funding pathway<br>leading to a separation of the two<br>in my view what's<br>really needed is<br>to take the funding out of the hospitals<br>and to take the funding out of primary<br>care out of the locality networks as<br>such and put it somewhere in between and<br>so that there is a requirement for<br>the two parts of the sector to actually<br>work actively and collaboratively<br>together in order to<br>access the important funding and this of<br>course<br>would<br>give way to the really important<br>clinically led conversations that need<br>to happen between the hospital<br>specialists and other hospital-based<br>staff and the primary care<br>practitioners general practice and<br>practitioners and other primary care<br>uh workers<br>because once you have those sorts of<br>conversations happening and the funding<br>sits there as well around the table then<br>you have the capacity to really shift<br>services between the sectors and again<br>there's nothing new in this and<br>the prior government and this government<br>have both been focused on these sorts of<br>questions but i think the reform is<br>going to work against them certainly in<br>the short term now if you're able to<br>have those kinds of conversations you<br>can get services such as for example<br>colonoscopy which is currently requiring<br>a visit to a hospital clinic<br>the<br>procedure is performed by a<br>gastroenterologist<br>um if you look around the world uh you<br>will find that these procedures are<br>performed by nurses with technical<br>skills freeing up the<br>out in gastrointestinal community not in<br>a hospital freeing up the<br>gastroenterologist's time to do high<br>level specialist work<br>so<br>there's a need to really rethink about<br>the gap between the primary and the<br>secondary and how we're going to resolve<br>that and in the second point uh i want<br>to make just to sort of close up is that<br>the reforms are really focused on equity<br>this sits at the heart of what the<br>government has been talking about<br>seeking to solve the long-standing<br>issues to do with equity around<br>healthcare access and healthcare<br>outcomes in this country<br>um<br>and i think there's a<br>fundamental<br>problem which the reforms are not<br>confronting<br>and that is the public private<br>divide in terms of health care is<br>delivered in this country and again this<br>is not uncommon globally every health<br>care system in the world has<br>a component of public and of private but<br>it's how you manage the two sectors<br>which is really critical to<br>trying to resolve the equity issue and<br>we all know that<br>those who have insurance which is<br>expensive<br>or who are lucky enough to have an<br>employer who provides an insurance<br>and that's not common<br>or who have deep pockets can simply pay<br>to get for example gallstones uh done<br>privately next week whereas in the<br>public sector uh getting gallstones done<br>you're really way way down the bottom of<br>the list and you're likely to be<br>prescribed morphine and sent back to<br>work<br>um until you have an acute episode and<br>are treated on a sunday morning at 2am<br>and so you know resolving these problems<br>is is just not<br>achievable within the current<br>arrangements and um and i don't think<br>the government government's going to be<br>able to deliver on its goals uh within<br>the current arrangements and so to me<br>uh and i've thought quite a bit about<br>this and there is no perfect funding<br>arrangement anywhere in the world<br>uh to me uh we need to start having a<br>conversation around social insurance for<br>health care in this country<br>now if you go to countries with social<br>insurance in germany is the prime<br>example but you'll find it in japan<br>korea taiwan and various other parts of<br>the world as well<br>what's important about social insurance<br>is that<br>equity is a key focus<br>in solidarity and so<br>you will find that<br>regardless of who you are what your<br>income status is or where you live<br>you can make a choice public or private<br>and the providers all work off the<br>social insurance fund and so it would<br>mean that the underlying institutional<br>arrangements public and private sector<br>which politically uh are deeply<br>difficult<br>to to try and broach uh would not need<br>to be<br>um<br>dug into any deeper uh because the<br>social insurance would simply become the<br>funder agnostic uh of provider<br>um so uh that's that's probably some<br>comments to open up with and uh look<br>forward to further discussion thank you<br>thanks robin that's great<br>uh and thank you for for your<br>comprehensive suggestions too throwing<br>the social insurance on the table so<br>early in the session i'm very impressed<br>with that<br>now<br>we do have a late apology unfortunately<br>des<br>we've just heard has been called a way<br>to deal with urgently with a patient<br>matter<br>which of course does happen to our<br>medical professionals and we have to<br>obviously respect that um so uh i'm<br>aware a bit of some of dez's feedback on<br>the topic so perhaps i'll introduce that<br>afterwards briefly<br>but of course we accept his apology and<br>hope everything goes well there and uh<br>we move on immediately to<br>the uh the primary care end of the<br>spectrum and ranjana patel thank you<br>very much for joining us uh this morning<br>uh and ranjan as i said uh lee is<br>co-founder and director of tamaki health<br>uh and uh<br>has a range of perspectives not just on<br>the current health reforms but also<br>what's going right and what's going<br>um as i'm speaking at a economic forum i<br>need to put a qualifier in i am not<br>qualified in economics in any way am not<br>a doctor but have been at the coal face<br>of general practice since 1977<br>starting in otara i am now retired from<br>the business and i work and working in<br>the community with police creating a<br>different model for family home in new<br>zealand our biggest shame<br>as you can imagine 45 years being in the<br>most vulnerable community my views on<br>recovery and reinvigoration are many and<br>thank you robin you have covered off the<br>health forum very adequately um of my<br>views colonoscopy we decided back<br>um must be 10 11 years ago bulldog a<br>whole medical center in otara to cope<br>with secondary care but the funding just<br>couldn't move from secondary to primary<br>so<br>it's deja vu for me these health reforms<br>we've been there done that hasn't worked<br>um<br>but as we have limited time today um i<br>will talk on the challenges we've faced<br>and covered and perhaps a few views on<br>recovery<br>workforce has been our biggest issue we<br>have over 1100 staff and over the past<br>two years they have lived up to our<br>values and their profession of here to<br>serve<br>but they are exhausted and they are<br>tired of being scared<br>covert is here to stay let's just get on<br>with the work<br>our pipeline of overseas doctors has<br>completely shut down<br>as a<br>and with the vulnerability of our aging<br>workforce our able staff had have had to<br>step up to cover<br>but there are 47 doctors i know of that<br>have passed the nzrx exam part one and<br>are unable to get placements in<br>hospitals or in general practice<br>to get their registration<br>and general practice isn't allowed to<br>take them<br>when 42<br>of our doctors are overseas trained and<br>we don't have enough here we need to<br>create a pathways for the ones already<br>sitting in new zealand to help with our<br>health care<br>a bit of background on this my husband<br>arrived in new zealand in 1974 from<br>india and no one would give him a<br>pathway to registrations hospitals would<br>say get your registration we'll give you<br>a job and medical council will say get a<br>job and we'll give you registration<br>it took six months for someone to sit<br>say sit this american ecfmg exam and<br>we'll give you your registration<br>at least he had a pathway but we don't<br>have a pathway in 2022.<br>since the mid-80s immigration changed<br>their laws<br>and we have a lot of overseas doctors<br>and nurses coming into new zealand that<br>are not registered in new zealand<br>majority because especially nurses from<br>the islands cannot pass the english exam<br>which my nurse leader on several<br>occasions said she would have trouble<br>passing<br>these people we've employed they are the<br>unemployable because they are not<br>doctors they are not nurses they are not<br>project managers<br>but we employ them to be our diabetes<br>educators recalling and talking to<br>patients about preventative health they<br>have come from an environment when they<br>have done outreach clinics and remote<br>areas with diagnose with little<br>diagnostic support they have delivered<br>babies they have done diabetes education<br>they've done immunization they've done<br>minor surgery<br>so even though they are only using a<br>fraction of their knowledge they got to<br>know the new zealand health system by<br>building their confidence<br>and then shadowing doctors many have got<br>their registrations to be nurses and<br>doctors<br>another example is a tongan health<br>practitioner<br>that we<br>employed she could not get recognized as<br>a doctor or a nurse because she didn't<br>fit into any category<br>she could just not move forward<br>she has worked with us for 20 years as<br>clinical family navigator visiting homes<br>education page educating patients on<br>self-management has put three children<br>through private schools through<br>scholarships and seeing them graduate at<br>university<br>we need to see people's strengths<br>not what they are not<br>that's how you provide equity<br>my second point is the mode of delivery<br>we need to be patient-centric not<br>wellington-centric and not pc centric if<br>we want to make a difference<br>we started in otara and we realized<br>nine-to-five appointment-based service<br>wasn't going to work and wasn't going to<br>pay our mortgage<br>it was the population that we were<br>serving<br>we needed to increase access time-wise<br>and financially<br>in those days phones and cars were<br>luxury in otara so we made it welcomed<br>and opened longer hours<br>totally against our profession must be a<br>dodgy indian couple<br>and then we introduced computers in 1984<br>so patients could go anywhere and their<br>notes would be there<br>patients own their notes not the doctors<br>patient centric majority of our clinics<br>across auckland are on one database<br>we need to let primary care come up with<br>what works for their patients it doesn't<br>fit into one box if telehealth works and<br>it did during covert let's see if we can<br>extrapolate that to do self-management<br>preventative health<br>and mental health<br>we we have to look at what mode works<br>for today and for your population and<br>not be suspicious of a different way of<br>working<br>regarding increasing access to health<br>care for maori and pacific while we<br>applaud the good work that pacific for<br>pacific and maori for maori general<br>practices do do for the wha now it needs<br>to be acknowledged that the majority of<br>the pacifica and maori are actually<br>enrolled in what is deemed to be<br>mainstream general practice<br>for example our practices in auckland<br>have 80 000 pacific patients enrolled<br>53 000 of those are in counties manukau<br>practices making us the largest provider<br>of pacific and south auckland<br>however<br>deemed being mainstream and not at<br>pacific providers means the practices<br>serving them don't have any additional<br>resources offered to pacific providers<br>yet our patients don't attend anywhere<br>else<br>as the practice endeavours to lower all<br>barriers such as cost extended hours and<br>placement of the practice within a high<br>needs communities<br>we have four generations coming through<br>our doors<br>this highlights their inequity in<br>equality in the distribution of the<br>health dollar the dollar has to follow<br>the patients not who you are and what<br>you are in primary health care<br>covert has highlighted we are the poor<br>cousins in healthcare general practice<br>the trust and confidence in gps from<br>patients has been broken over the two<br>years we are just the ambulance at the<br>bottom of the cliff<br>history showed gps could manage<br>outbreaks by getting their patients<br>vaccinated and seen<br>the first point of contact was taken<br>away from the patients<br>we look after eighty percent of health<br>care needs and get less than twenty<br>percent of the health care budget<br>if we do not address this issue we will<br>be filling the hospitals very quickly<br>our chronic disease patients diabetes<br>obesity cancers are all going unchecked<br>we have to remove the scare tactics in<br>the community and start to empower<br>people to look after their health<br>conditions<br>prevention is better than cure<br>we have seen a big difference in the new<br>way of managing chronic disease with<br>health coaches peer supports<br>self-management and getting off the<br>couch working with people over 200 kvs<br>doctors cannot do everything but they<br>know what works for their patients and<br>need to be able to let the other<br>professionals and community workers do a<br>lot more of the educating<br>mental health will be a big issue we've<br>seen that in the household family harm<br>has increased so much<br>um patients presenting with unknown<br>symptoms are quite<br>have underlying issues with mental<br>health and we're just not dealing with<br>it<br>our in-house psychiatrist david says<br>what's been seen in the homes during<br>lockdown is going to take three<br>generations to be stamped out of<br>people's head we do what we see not what<br>we're told<br>it would be a miss of me not to<br>highlight the issue general practice has<br>faced over the past two years<br>and yesterday it was really<br>revealed by the mp<br>it just announced<br>uh on tv that gps can do the rat test<br>from tomorrow it took all of us by<br>surprise<br>my ce had to act quickly as people<br>started to demand the rectes<br>i messaged as<br>stefan said i messaged ashley letting<br>him know that we received only enough<br>for testing staff for one exposure event<br>each and we would have to make an<br>announcement<br>due to the high volume of cause demands<br>from patients<br>rapid tests<br>are not publicly available we had to put<br>this on our website we have had a very<br>high number of requests for these tests<br>from our patients however although they<br>are on order from the ministry of health<br>supply none of our clinics have been<br>provided their necessary allocations for<br>general public supply or use we regret<br>we have no visibility of insuff<br>sufficient supply of rats will be made<br>available to us<br>now this is not serving our patients<br>this is not patient strength<br>centric<br>we had this happen with testing we had<br>this happen with vaccines and once again<br>the poor cousins are the ambulance at<br>the bottom of the cliff<br>thank you for listening to me<br>thank you very much<br>and<br>sadly the story that you've just relayed<br>about rap tests<br>um unfortunately is does appear to have<br>been symptomatic of some of the things<br>through the pandemic between the<br>ministry<br>and and the providers i suppose and the<br>people that are with the<br>uh are looking after the patients<br>i want to cover three things in the time<br>remaining if i can and we'll start<br>perhaps with that mode of delivery or<br>point of delivery<br>uh and<br>uh and then i wanted<br>to go into the reforms and finally a<br>little bit of workforce and perhaps a<br>comment from each of you on on those<br>three things<br>if we start with motive delivery<br>robin i think we're probably hearing uh<br>symptoms of<br>this issue with<br>with funding and that inability to to<br>move easily funding between different uh<br>modes of delivery uh you know<br>experienced their first hand with rajna<br>and the team at tamaki health<br>and you picked that up with this whole<br>issue of<br>of uh of hospital funding or or private<br>funding and i think it's fair to say the<br>dhb model has definitely meant that it's<br>much more hospital-centric<br>than probably because that's where all<br>the risk is right uh running a hospital<br>is expensive<br>but that doesn't solve it from a patient<br>perspective so uh i suppose my question<br>to you is<br>how can we make it work better i do you<br>agree with rajna that the the funding<br>actually has to follow the patient where<br>the patient wants to be is where the<br>funding should be<br>no i do and um<br>uh<br>you know this is this is actually a<br>critical component of<br>research and policy and health policy<br>globally now<br>uh is um<br>the patient perspective and um<br>you can<br>bring real power to conversations around<br>health systems through bringing in the<br>patient voice i mean we've had<br>quite a long history of<br>trying to work in this way in new<br>zealand but i don't think that we've<br>been able to articulate it as strongly<br>as it could have been or brought the<br>patient voice into the health system<br>and policy discussions<br>uh in ways in which we should have done<br>um<br>and again if i come back to the social<br>insurance um and i don't want to sound<br>like too much of a loud drum but uh with<br>social insurance i mean a patient<br>decides whether they want to go to the<br>private hospital or the public one or a<br>general practitioner you know you can<br>still have gatekeeping with a gp<br>but it actually gives the patient quite<br>a lot of choice within that context and<br>you think about acc which is for one of<br>a better term the form of social<br>insurance will be just covering<br>accidents and injuries so<br>um you know that that funding model<br>would give a bit more power to the<br>patient voice<br>i think um so now i completely agree<br>it's absolutely important we haven't<br>done a good enough job of it<br>and<br>you there's almost two parts to that<br>isn't it there's the funding itself and<br>then there's how you fund it so the<br>insurance part is how you fund it<br>uh then the equity part is the part that<br>runs has been talking about<br>reuniting do you see anything of these<br>current reforms that will make it easier<br>for tamaki health to do its job for its<br>300 000 patients<br>compared to now at this point<br>um<br>no we've been through localities um<br>you know 18 years ago it didn't work<br>um<br>the<br>assuming<br>all indians want to go to indian doctors<br>all pacific want to go to pacific<br>doctors is<br>very limited in its thought we don't<br>have enough doctors and nurses to cover<br>every ethnicity in new zealand um<br>we do need to look at<br>i like your social insurance<br>it is so important<br>that everybody is able to<br>have<br>um service as you say with<br>any kind of hip operation or um<br>if you go to private you can go do it<br>next week if you go to public you're not<br>that bad you can wait six weeks<br>we saw over<br>um covert that our platform better<br>worked very well with patients<br>but it worked patients in rural areas<br>where they couldn't get to gps<br>and because we made children free a lot<br>of parents were ringing to use that<br>service for children so that they could<br>get health care a funding model doesn't<br>allow any creativity and so over covered<br>we set up this better platform but we<br>couldn't charge the patients um and<br>because we've never ever made patients<br>um<br>not<br>to be seen even if they have large<br>accounts it's always been my husband and<br>my philosophy<br>that everybody deserves health care um<br>if you have patient loyalty and as i<br>said fourth generations of people coming<br>through us<br>to us is patient loyalty um it's<br>important we do the best for them<br>when we're seen to be<br>an effectual like this rats testing<br>um no one believes that no the prime<br>minister said you can have a vaccine but<br>we don't have vaccines you can have a<br>rat test no but we don't have raps yes<br>our credibility as primary care has<br>really deteriorated with our patients<br>our trust and confidence saying well you<br>know someone's telling us you can<br>and you can't really so if we just<br>allowed more people to be able to<br>deliver different types of health<br>service to what is needed um<br>self-management peer support is<br>invaluable to a lot of our patients<br>deterring from house a little bit um you<br>know when we talk about mode of delivery<br>i've started a family harm project with<br>the help of partnering with police<br>where you look at the perpetrators<br>and you reform<br>the two perpetrators because they are 95<br>of the offenders<br>now if you don't change the core problem<br>or address the core problem our family<br>home statistics are going to stay the<br>same and i i was criticized for working<br>with the scum of the earth the<br>perpetrators but majority of the women<br>take the men back and we're giving them<br>no tools to deal with the next episode<br>so<br>messy research has been done on our<br>program was sixty percent over a five<br>year period did not reoffend again<br>internationally unheard of in family<br>harm projects but it's still seen as<br>something suspicious i started it for<br>indian men and now it's majority pacific<br>and maori and so if you do it with<br>patient-centric it works for everyone<br>and i think the motor delivery has to<br>focus on being patient-centric what will<br>benefit the new zealand health system if<br>we work with the core need of the<br>patients<br>so what i'm hearing from rajna and robin<br>and you can both correct me if i'm wrong<br>is you're not convinced and des was the<br>same by the way in the notes that he and<br>i discussed ahead of time<br>that the health reforms are in many ways<br>just rearranging the bureaucracy<br>um to put it<br>perhaps less and charitably i mean that<br>people work hard but nevertheless<br>there's a rearranging of the bureaucracy<br>until we get to a much more patient<br>centered money follows the patient and<br>their needs then we're not really going<br>to change things too much<br>okay<br>i'll take that as as we're at because i<br>want to move on to one further thing and<br>that is the workforce challenges and<br>we've had a couple of questions here uh<br>we've got our own uh we've had got our<br>own nurses and doctors still leaving the<br>country uh people want to know why that<br>is when we're bringing in 40 odd percent<br>of our doctors and nurses from offshore<br>and they also want to know<br>with two years of the borders closed how<br>big is the whole how i mean how<br>desperately are we in<br>in regards to the health workforce and<br>and are we going to be able to solve it<br>using our normal training methods so<br>perhaps if i go with you robin first and<br>then randomly we've only got a few<br>minutes but a quick comment from each<br>yeah look no thanks this is a really<br>important question i'm of course not at<br>the front line but we historically have<br>been the<br>highest importer<br>in terms of total doctor percentage<br>of foreign born and trained doctors in<br>the oecd 45 46<br>of our doctors one one in four doctors<br>uh from the uk<br>and nurses is not far behind and it's a<br>revolving door they<br>uh<br>about half of those doctors will only<br>stay here two years and then and this is<br>pre-covered and then go back overseas<br>again they might go they might come here<br>and then go to australia or go back to<br>the uk or wherever they've come from so<br>it's really it's a historic very<br>pressing and very real<br>problem um part of it's to do with the<br>training i think we<br>have been increasing the number of<br>certainly medical trainees and nurse<br>trainees and other professions<br>but part of it also i think<br>relates to scope of practice the point i<br>was making about gastroenterologists<br>undertaking colonoscopies and if if we<br>were able to have and i know that des<br>has been very involved in these<br>conversations with health workforce nz<br>they're really challenging because of<br>the the strong strong um protection of<br>interests within for example the medical<br>colleges so as i said elsewhere in the<br>world nurses are trained<br>to work under the supervision of a<br>gastroenterologist to do the procedures<br>so they can spend all day doing the<br>procedures and free up the<br>gastroenterologist to do other work but<br>there's a private component to this as<br>well<br>and i'm not going to make accusations<br>you can have your own thoughts about<br>this people here today<br>but private gastroenterologists um you<br>know do a lot of work privately so there<br>are really important conversations to be<br>had<br>around all of this again and this is why<br>i come back to the social insurance<br>concept because it's agnostic of where<br>you provide the service<br>you know the funder has a fee schedule<br>and a method for sort of funding the<br>different services so you don't have to<br>dig into these<br>really difficult questions but i think<br>the scope of practice one's a a really<br>important one<br>thanks rajna um two things then one is<br>the um how big a problem are we dealing<br>with right now what's you know on the<br>front line what's the shortage like are<br>we likely to recover from it in the next<br>year or two and then secondly the scope<br>of practice question should we for<br>example be letting practice nurses do<br>more should we be letting<br>radiographers do more for example<br>rather than relying always on those<br>relatively small number of specialists<br>at the top of the system<br>from a general practice point of view<br>first of all the workforce we are at<br>critical stages we have the added<br>problem of people going back<br>home to uk and australia our doctors<br>especially our 24<br>7 centers we run two in auckland um<br>our local doctors don't want to work the<br>evening shifts over night shifts and so<br>it's usually the overseas doctors that<br>are manning them<br>uk and australia you're right robert<br>most of them do go back the money's a<br>lot better over there<br>the 47 doctors i'm talking about are all<br>ethnic doctors that would be<br>wanting to stay in new zealand and yet<br>we're not letting them um<br>the nurses<br>we have the added problems of the nurses<br>being attracted to the dhb on much<br>higher pay scale than general practice<br>can offer<br>and so we've lost quite a few nurses<br>two hospitals who have come back again<br>you earn more being a vaccinator for the<br>dhv than you do in general practice so<br>yes<br>economics has paid such a big part to<br>the doctors and nurses moving and job<br>security and longevity<br>scope of practice you know yes it's such<br>a<br>limiting thing in patch protective<br>protection for the medical council and<br>the nursing council that they do not<br>recognize anybody's capability of doing<br>it and we as general practice see the<br>benefit and peer support and<br>self-management from people that have<br>lived of the disease and mental health<br>people that have gone through it are<br>much more able to communicate with<br>people that are suffering from it<br>and so the scope of practice it<br>limits so much of what the professionals<br>can do what lay people can build up to<br>do and so we need pathways of doing that<br>we don't have enough doctors in new<br>zealand that are going to qualify um and<br>everyone's ambitious the kiwi way is to<br>have two three years overseas and that's<br>going to happen even though we've got<br>more doctors in the system at the moment<br>most of them will be going overseas for<br>the oe and so you know we're in the same<br>dire situation that either we increase<br>it dramatically<br>um<br>and allow overseas doctors in from<br>accredited universities um that can get<br>registration a pathway into general<br>practice because the hospitals can't<br>cope with them<br>these 47 doctors need to get hospital<br>space and no one's giving them jobs in<br>hospitals so the scope of practice and<br>who's in the who's doing what is so<br>important and let general practice<br>decide who does what um you know the<br>college can say<br>um<br>scope of practices we just you know i<br>can't put this on the government this is<br>the governing bodies of the different<br>institutions that are limiting what is<br>able to be done in new zealand<br>feels like scope of practice needs<br>looking at it feels like the method of<br>training needs looking at uh<br>i'll throw a plug-in for the host<br>university here uh that pretty keen on a<br>third medical school i know in your neck<br>of the woods robin they probably<br>wouldn't be quite so keen<br>but you know it's something that it<br>feels like it's time has come i mean we<br>need to get on not necessarily the same<br>as the other two medical schools but uh<br>perhaps one focus particularly on<br>general practice or something like that<br>which just provides those opportunities<br>greater opportunities for people<br>domestically to increase the supply<br>but also<br>we're going to have to be working pretty<br>hard to bring people in because i<br>imagine we're in a very competitive<br>world at the moment<br>for doctors and nurses<br>of all specialties and generalities look<br>and i thank you both very much for your<br>time this morning and also stepping up<br>in in dez's absence i think you've<br>represented uh very similar views to<br>what uh des would have offered in terms<br>of the<br>in terms of the views on the reforms i<br>think hopefully there's something there<br>for uh minister little to think about uh<br>there'll be a terrible travesty if we do<br>all this reform and we end up having the<br>same conversations in three years time<br>uh which and sadly it looks possible at<br>least at this point so thank you both uh<br>and on our cross back to matt who i<br>kia ora<br>welcome back to the other side of the<br>studio and we're very happy now for this<br>next session to be welcoming the right<br>honourable helen clark<br>now of course we know uh helen is our<br>former prime minister of new zealand but<br>also has led the massive united nations<br>development program and more recently<br>has co-chaired the independent panel on<br>pandemic preparedness and response so<br>given these roles she has a unique<br>perspective on the theme of this<br>conference dealing with coverts long<br>tail<br>cure helen welcome to the forum very<br>much looking forward to<br>hearing your views and of course for<br>those watching please do send in through<br>some questions and we'll have time for a<br>little q a with helen shortly<br>hiromat and good morning everyone<br>i've mostly you know focused uh since<br>leaving for the un<br>all those years ago on on global issues<br>but of course you know you always keep<br>an eye out for your own country and how<br>it's it's navigating through those<br>uh sorry i haven't been able to join<br>earlier but my conference calls went to<br>4 30 a.m this morning so i didn't think<br>i'd be um particularly on to advice<br>attend on the conference at 10 o'clock<br>but i thought i'd just you know make<br>some opening remarks and really invite<br>people to<br>come in and exchange uh views<br>the topic i know is major opportunities<br>and challenges for new zealand you know<br>following<br>following covert and i wish we were<br>following covert and that's part of the<br>point of what i want to say<br>we don't seem to be able to get this<br>this off our back uh globally<br>and i i think<br>really complicating the whole scene is<br>we're not just dealing with covert we're<br>dealing with as a world a syndemic of<br>issues a whole lot of major issues<br>coming at us<br>simultaneously<br>this is without doubt the worst health<br>emergency<br>in a century<br>that's<br>you know in the lifetimes of<br>almost everyone living in new zealand my<br>father's about to celebrate his 100th<br>birthday he wasn't here for the great<br>flu epidemic<br>in 1918.<br>yes aids<br>is described as a pandemic by unaids and<br>took a huge toll of lives but we haven't<br>seen anything like this global impact of<br>a pathogen<br>since uh 1918.<br>and we weren't ready for it which was<br>the<br>of course a key finding<br>of the independent panel for pandemic<br>preparedness response which i co-chaired<br>and on which we built recommendations to<br>try to do better<br>when a future threat emerges because you<br>can't stop these<br>kinds of events<br>arising a zoonotic spill overall<br>which is usually the cause<br>but you can stop them becoming a<br>pandemic and that's what the world<br>doesn't really fail to do<br>but then you you<br>put alongside this<br>extraordinary challenge<br>which is wrecked economies<br>challenge societies shaken some to their<br>roots<br>the fact that we're living through an<br>era of the worst relations between the<br>major powers since the cold war<br>ended<br>uh<br>some<br>30-plus years ago and a world where new<br>zealanders is pressured to take to take<br>sides which which threatens the rather<br>careful<br>balancing act<br>we have had particularly with with<br>respect to<br>china and then we have the other you<br>know existential what's what's happening<br>to the climate highly relevant to new<br>zealand with its you know enormous uh<br>agricultural and horticultural base<br>i retain very close uh family farming<br>connections and in the<br>south waikato area<br>the seasons are more unpredictable<br>the rain's unreliable when it comes and<br>comes and<br>amounts we can't deal with how many<br>times in the last year has westport been<br>told to evacuate i mean this is a crisis<br>and so not just for our rural<br>communities<br>and still very much the backbone of new<br>zealand<br>but also because we've always<br>traditionally built around our river<br>mouths and coastlines and our<br>settlements threatened time and time<br>again so<br>these these are a huge set of risks put<br>together something that doesn't impact<br>so directly on new zealand but the world<br>is facing its worst<br>forced displacement crises uh<br>ever<br>we could say since the end of the second<br>world war but at over one percent of the<br>world's population is now forcibly<br>displaced from its home by war conflict<br>repression and and so on and that puts<br>quite a burden on the international<br>humanitarian system which it isn't isn't<br>coping with<br>and of course the more<br>money that that has to be diverted to<br>that from playing ordinary mainstream<br>development the more you can't address<br>the underlying issues<br>so<br>we live in a pretty uh vaccine and<br>troubled<br>world<br>that leads me to say that<br>everyone is in the business of making<br>decisions which we all are from the<br>level of the individual<br>family<br>what they buy and invest in<br>social policy developers the business<br>community our economists our political<br>decision makers we're all making<br>decisions in times of huge<br>volatility<br>uncertainty and risk and this is the new<br>normal there's not going to be any<br>return<br>to you know perhaps the sort of cosy<br>days of 2000 when we worried about the<br>the y2 whatever bug<br>our<br>computer systems you know<br>these are<br>new times no return to the status quo<br>anti<br>and for<br>all countries including ours how you try<br>to build resilience and the strength to<br>ride through these kinds of events<br>minimize the the impact on<br>populations economy societies is really<br>a<br>critical issue<br>on covert i think you may have just had<br>a<br>session with health health people i see<br>the<br>reporting today that globally the cases<br>have been falling<br>for the last three weeks clearly we<br>account for cyclical this because we<br>uh have breathless headlines every day<br>about the<br>the growing numbers and we're now at the<br>point where i think everyone in new<br>zealand knows someone who's had it which<br>hasn't necessarily been faced<br>here in the past<br>again<br>huge uncertainty<br>about<br>predicting the path of this but<br>it is most likely to keep coming in<br>waves and surges<br>with the possibility<br>of<br>something worse than<br>omicron<br>coming along because we're giving<br>globally the virus the opportunities<br>to change<br>the way it behaves that's because we are<br>not on top of transmission<br>and while some have hailed on a crime as<br>perhaps the the beginning<br>of the end maybe it may not be because<br>of this virus<br>continually<br>surprising us<br>the problem is that if you let<br>transmission run unhindered<br>because of<br>substantial unvaccinated populations in<br>the world all because<br>countries which in my opinion like the<br>united kingdom shouldn't have better you<br>remove all controls and and let it erupt<br>to the point where your<br>very elderly monarch is among those<br>affected you are creating opportunities<br>for the virus south africa i see is now<br>reporting<br>more concern about the variant of obama<br>from<br>which is which is more<br>transmissible again<br>we're not on the current trends<br>expecting<br>uh much of africa to get anything like<br>even 70<br>vaccination until<br>2024 this is two years away for a virus<br>running wild and as i said it's not just<br>africa it's<br>myanmar it's afghanistan the failed<br>states where you can't<br>conceivably roll out a<br>vaccination program and then this<br>propensity in the northern hemisphere to<br>declare victory before the the job is<br>done look i understand people are<br>completely fed up and over this virus<br>i'm completely over it as a global<br>citizen has traveled a lot i haven't<br>left the country since march 2020 i mean<br>of course it's imperial<br>we can't just get on with life but we're<br>going to have to get on with life in<br>different ways from what we did before<br>we may be over covered but it's not<br>over us<br>and<br>with the work that that our panel did we<br>we charted the opportunities that<br>this outbreak had to<br>to get away from being a<br>fairly<br>low<br>number event in the province of china to<br>become a global pandemic there were many<br>opportunities missed<br>the who was<br>underpowered to deal with the challenge<br>and it didn't have the degree of<br>cooperation it needed from the source<br>country not notwithstanding that you<br>know and the fact that there were lost<br>weeks and dealing with it in january<br>2020 i think february 2020 will also go<br>down the history books as a huge missed<br>opportunity because the world<br>despite<br>having a declaration of a public health<br>emergency of international concern from<br>the world health organization kind of<br>sat back thought oh well it'll be sars<br>it will be a dollar it won't vote affect<br>us<br>and how wrong that was i had occasion in<br>recent months to dig out again<br>when the first press statement from the<br>health ministry here was about<br>a case of a covert in new zealand 28th<br>of february 2020 and the press statement<br>ended with words something like this is<br>not expected to lead to widespread<br>community transmission i mean yeah we<br>were out to lunch and much much of the<br>world was out to lunch and predicting<br>what uh what this could do and and the<br>rest is history so we're going to be<br>troubled by by this for<br>some time i'm<br>still<br>very much<br>advocating for the recommendations of<br>our panel there are also other good<br>panels<br>from from g20<br>which have good recommendations on the<br>table and we're working<br>uh to see if the un general assembly<br>will pick up the issue with a special<br>session and give momentum uh to the<br>reforms that are needed uh to try to<br>stop something was bad happening again<br>but if it happened again tomorrow that<br>the world would not be ready is this is<br>our guess<br>now it just perhaps to come to a few<br>words<br>on<br>the challenges of<br>i mean<br>when we took the measures which<br>of the health and well-being of new<br>zealand were<br>and new zealanders were absolutely<br>necessary it actually turned out in the<br>bigger picture<br>uh<br>to probably be best economic responsible<br>circumstances because we have<br>not only had the lowest death rate per<br>capita in the oecd through the pandemic<br>uh we've also been about the fifth best<br>economic<br>and<br>again the primary sectors that played an<br>enormous part in bringing<br>new zealand through we we ended up<br>writing off international tourism<br>writing of international education but<br>clearly the days are coming when we will<br>manage<br>some kind of rebuilding these sectors<br>but i think the challenge really is to<br>do it differently and always be looking<br>to<br>the value and<br>the productivity and the innovation in<br>these sectors<br>not just treating them as as commodities<br>where they have maximum numbers with a<br>with a low yield it's easy to say and<br>hard to do but i think that's where the<br>smart thinking has to be and and right<br>across across the economy it's always a<br>challenge for the uh the primary sectors<br>as well we need a huge focus on<br>innovation<br>i recall launching a government strategy<br>two decades ago on growth by innovation<br>you probably issued the<br>same today we get we can never stop<br>innovating we're in a race to the future<br>and if we get off that treadmill others<br>pass us by<br>pretty fast we have had opportunities to<br>um<br>have skilled and talented new zealanders<br>back here through the pandemic very<br>important to create the environment<br>where they feel that they can thrive<br>here<br>and<br>otherwise<br>as<br>circumstances relax particularly in<br>australia<br>we run the risk of the<br>brain drain<br>again<br>uh one last point perhaps i'd make<br>before stopping is that<br>globally the pandemic has<br>been exacerbated by pre-existing<br>inequalities and marginalization between<br>countries and within countries we're not<br>an exception to that this has exposed<br>our fractures<br>and i think<br>smart minds need to very much be turned<br>to how do we build social cohesion how<br>do we build an economy in society where<br>everyone really feels they do have a<br>state and we don't leave<br>people behind we have had opportunities<br>to move more new zealanders into work<br>because of the lack of immigrant labour<br>could can we make this a permanent<br>feature that the keys are doing more of<br>the jobs and we're consciously<br>rehabilitating those who've fallen too<br>fast through the cracks to rise<br>into the labor market before there are<br>opportunities here<br>to deal with some of our<br>longer standing issues<br>so uh<br>that's<br>probably all for me for an opening on<br>the kind of reset that we need but this<br>issue of the global reset has been very<br>much on the minds of world of night form<br>and others the problem is that we never<br>quite<br>get the clear<br>air for the reset because the pandemic<br>keeps coming at us and<br>offering us more surprises and then as i<br>say it's immensely complicated now by<br>the<br>uh<br>the<br>worsening relationships between western<br>china and obviously<br>devastating uh developments in ukraine<br>and all of these issues have threats for<br>us of one kind of another whether it's<br>supply chain disruption market<br>disruption<br>and so on back to you matt<br>gotta thank you helen and there are a<br>few topics that i'm very keen to pick up<br>there both on the on the pandemic and<br>looking more broadly at the geopolitical<br>situation as i know you're<br>you're still uh very well connected and<br>in the in the thick of things on many<br>levels there first<br>the panel that you co-chaired and you've<br>touched on some of these themes now<br>was highly critical about the missteps<br>in the early days also about inequities<br>in<br>vaccination rates across the world<br>hearing you just now talk about that<br>critical period of february two years<br>ago<br>what do you think this sounds like a<br>systemic issue it's it's hard to see the<br>way forward<br>what do you think<br>has changed what have we learned that<br>could prepare us because you'd have to<br>say the money would be on not being<br>another 100 years before an event of<br>this size we've got more people we've<br>got different interactions with um<br>animals people are moving around the<br>world or all of those things what do you<br>think we've learned and what needs to<br>change<br>there's nothing to say that a zoonotic<br>spillover event can't happen tomorrow<br>next week you know i mean in a way we've<br>been lucky to dodge a bullet like this<br>for a century<br>you know<br>what if sars had come<br>to us<br>a lot of ebola<br>come to us but<br>but this pathogen respiratory pathogen<br>just just took off when it wasn't<br>contained at an early stage<br>now<br>what<br>what we said was this<br>china was not<br>transparent<br>and<br>jim mcclay peter gluckman<br>probably alex gillespie like he's on the<br>line for law school some very smart<br>minds in new zealand linked up offshore<br>with with what is needed<br>by by means of a new<br>set of legal arrangements around<br>pandemics<br>we<br>this will be hard because member states<br>you know will stand on the pinhead of<br>sovereignty you know you can't tell us<br>what to do<br>but what the who needs is<br>when word of a pandemic threat emerges<br>it's got to get to the site<br>immediately<br>automatic access to visas and entry this<br>didn't happen<br>quite a while before the who actually<br>got to uh<br>also<br>there was not an official notification<br>from the government of china the who<br>and it's its networks um<br>are scanning<br>the the social media chatter the<br>the news networks globally<br>hour by hour minute by minute looking at<br>where there is news of some<br>event<br>and<br>what was picked up from wuhan<br>uh at the very end of december 2019<br>uh was that the wuhan<br>booth system issued a communication to<br>its hospitals about<br>a a pneumonia of of unknown uh<br>provenance<br>that's what was picked up and that's<br>when the who i think on the first of<br>january 2020 picked up the phone to<br>china you know radio silence<br>there was not proper information they<br>couldn't get access<br>also under the international health<br>regulations they they couldn't publish<br>the information that they had without<br>the permission of the member state<br>states<br>they seemed to feel very constrained by<br>the international health regulations<br>about taking a precautionary approach<br>and what our panel said was when a<br>respiratory pathogen with pandemic<br>potential is on the move<br>and there's a high likelihood of human<br>to human transmission which was denied<br>for a while<br>you need to act in a precautionary<br>fashion<br>now<br>the international health regulations<br>2005 were drawn up as a response to<br>sards<br>the director general of the time grow<br>harlem brooklyn former norwegian prime<br>minister<br>says to us if i had had to operate then<br>under sars<br>under the international health<br>regulations you have today i couldn't<br>have done my job<br>that's pretty stunning isn't it those<br>regulations are supposed to be improved<br>but actually they they tied the wh ho's<br>hands even more and before declaring a<br>public health emergency of international<br>concern they have to take so many boxes<br>they have to convene an emergency<br>committee the emergency committee is of<br>experts from around the world clearly<br>some of these come from states where<br>experts are not particularly free to run<br>an independent view the emergency<br>committee when called around the 22nd of<br>june january refused to recommend<br>that the international declaration be<br>issued so you lose another week while dr<br>tedros goes to china to<br>persuade them<br>i need help here i need to declare this<br>emergency all of this is nonsense he<br>needs access to the site he needs to<br>publish whatever information he's got<br>he's got to be able to act in a<br>precautionary way and he should have the<br>authority of his own volition backed by<br>his internal expert processes to declare<br>a pending that's how we lost the first<br>month lack of cooperation<br>and underpowered<br>who but as i said february uh when he<br>issued the declaration everyone sort of<br>sat back and said oh kind of interesting<br>what's happening in wuhan that that's<br>when it it got away<br>so the big lesson i think to countries<br>like ours is when a declaration like<br>this is made you wake up fast now<br>to the extent that we did act and we put<br>the travel ban on china and then iran<br>and then eventually it became the rest<br>of the world for a long time that at<br>least we did that heaven knows what had<br>happened that the nine flights a day had<br>had kept coming into new zealand uh<br>right through february that would have<br>been disastrous<br>but we need change to the international<br>health regulations we probably need in<br>our panel recommended an overarching new<br>pandemic framework treaty which sets out<br>the obligations of member states to<br>notify to cooperate with the who<br>that that<br>isn't in practice at the moment<br>no and it sounds<br>incredibly challenging to to get the<br>change that from the outside looks so so<br>obviously needed i'm gonna shift gears a<br>little bit but obviously the pandemic<br>affects every element of<br>society and geopolitics at the moment<br>this week<br>look at a tv screen<br>your news app there's a shadow over<br>europe there's a lot of tension<br>obviously<br>around ukraine<br>things are happening by the day by the<br>hour<br>but pull the pull the lens back a little<br>bit<br>and<br>from your time<br>and leadership at the un<br>from the longer perspective of the last<br>few decades there's a sense that the<br>global order is changing some of those<br>relationships between the superpowers<br>and in fact the power balances are<br>probably changing how do you see the<br>situation between some of the big<br>players at a geopolitical level evolving<br>over<br>not just<br>the next week or the next two<br>particularly around the ukraine but<br>those bigger forces how do you see those<br>well the ukraine<br>situation is catastrophic i<br>i mean bold prediction as things move by<br>the day i'm not yet convinced that<br>president putin's<br>going to try a you know a sort of total<br>angelus rolling the tanks right through<br>ukraine to kiev<br>but<br>he's he's created the ground<br>um obviously with the annexation of of<br>crimea uh eight years ago and the<br>he's in effect controlled those two<br>other two regions of ukraine since 2014<br>these separatists uh<br>yeah that is people uh<br>the russian military have been in there<br>one way or another that is now explicit<br>so what he's doing is he's testing the<br>boundaries he's testing how much will<br>the west do if i do this and then you<br>know he's the sort of guy if you give<br>him an answer he takes a mile<br>one of the big issues i think is whether<br>in his definition of recognizing the<br>independence of these two state lets<br>which is very much what he did with<br>those breakaway areas of georgia yeah<br>back in what 2008 nine uh<br>south ossetia and abkhazia<br>um<br>he's<br>basically made them for all intensive<br>purposes part of a larger<br>soviet union and he's trying to now<br>formalize those borders but how big is<br>that border how much over that line of<br>control has been of the conflict<br>never a frozen conflict from the last<br>eight years a lot of people die<br>well how far over that line will go<br>that's what he's testing now some maps<br>that they are issuing are suggesting<br>that the port of mario poll is within<br>the areas that he's recognizing is<br>as part of these statelets and the port<br>of mariopol<br>is not currently under separatist<br>control so there's a battle from for<br>mariopol<br>this will be pretty pretty shattering<br>but i think his assessment has been that<br>currently the west is is weak and<br>divided he would have looked at the<br>afghanistan debacle he will look at<br>you know a world distracted by by covert<br>president biden and us president now<br>always distracted by the major lack of<br>political<br>and shared purpose and<br>in the united states<br>uh he he will look at the us also<br>somewhat distracted by china and he'll<br>think i'll buddy up with china and you<br>know<br>i can<br>you know start recreating<br>the soviet union the demise of which i<br>said was the greatest tragedy of the<br>20th century that that's the mindset<br>uh so he'll just keep keep nibbling and<br>the u.s has got its<br>u.s and nato have got their sort of<br>escalating sanctions but at the moment<br>they're a slap over the west with the<br>word hanging they're not going to deter<br>him and you know at least going to the<br>formalization of the borders on the line<br>of control and i had a long conversation<br>with kevin rudd two or three weeks ago<br>and kevin had a very interesting phrase<br>about the challenge being how can we try<br>to return to some kind of managed<br>strategic competition<br>we know<br>there's you know all the difference in<br>the world between the political system<br>of new zealand and china<br>new zealand and russia the western china<br>west and russia but does that have to be<br>the first roadblock every time we have<br>any kind of interaction well can<br>sort of we<br>pragmatically scope out where we need to<br>work together and where we're going to<br>continue to have have differences can we<br>try to manage this better<br>actually we manage it better during the<br>cold war<br>but we've never really found<br>found the balance since and then since<br>then china has been on rise<br>uh russia's felt that it's been on the<br>on the decline and trying to<br>build itself up again<br>these are very challenging times what i<br>found really interesting was when there<br>was the special meeting of the security<br>council on ukraine<br>under russia's chairmanship because they<br>had the chair this month they didn't get<br>support from a single member not from<br>any of the usual suspects not from china<br>chinese foreign minister is making<br>statements about the sovereignty of<br>ukraine needing to be respected<br>so that they're kind of out on their own<br>there but i'm not sure that's any<br>concern to personal people<br>so<br>in the heat of this crisis it's hard to<br>see how you get<br>to sort of manage strategic competition<br>with russia in its present mood but<br>could it be possible with china because<br>you need cooperation<br>at the greatest geopolitical level<br>to end the pandemic<br>to tackle the climate issues<br>to try to stop some of the intractable<br>conflicts all of which have proxy powers<br>standing behind them whether it's russia<br>china the gulf whatever if if you just<br>have a lack of cooperation a lack of<br>dialogue we can't tackle any of these<br>issues effectively<br>no no it's a as you said at the start<br>it's a troubled world<br>look i'm uh i'm going to wrap us up now<br>we could obviously talk for several<br>hours more although it sounds like<br>you're on you'll be soon on to your next<br>bank of uh of conference calls in to<br>different parts of the world helen thank<br>you for your time and thank you for your<br>perspective it's great uh to have the<br>chance to connect um and i i hope you i<br>wish you well in your continuing work um<br>there's a lot on your plate obviously so<br>thank you for today kiara<br>thanks very much<br>and to all of our team we're about to go<br>into a break we will be back on at 12 30<br>time for a cup of tea and a rest and<br>pause<br>back after the lunch break we've got a<br>fantastic afternoon ahead<br>first session will be uh facilitated<br>again by stephen joyce a session on the<br>business environment then moving into a<br>panel on the maori economy<br>in the afternoon we'll then have a<br>session on economic disparity as<br>professor neil quigley outlined right at<br>the start of the day one of the most<br>important topics we're dealing with<br>into<br>a really interesting session given the<br>current stage around labor migration and<br>productivity and then<br>joined by one of helen clark's old<br>sparring partners another former prime<br>minister jim bolger who will close out<br>the day<br>for us later this afternoon so a lot to<br>look forward to enjoy the break and<br>gifted<br>the name raupapa papa<br>to the to the management school<br>and<br>uh for me<br>terror papa just fits this<br>space<br>ro papa<br>as a as a single word<br>means to arrange<br>things and put put things in there in<br>their in their place<br>uh so that they make sense<br>but that doesn't mean that they stay<br>there<br>they can be rearranged and they can be<br>reworked<br>so as a<br>as a simple word<br>that<br>management<br>in<br>that word is<br>it fits<br>it's amazing to look at the management<br>school and its achievements over the<br>last 50 years to imagine this place as a<br>couple of small pre-fair buildings on<br>the side of a hill in the hillcrest to<br>all of the achievements since<br>right from its founding<br>the waikato management school taro papa<br>has been focused on innovative<br>management and business education that<br>started with the innovative four-year<br>bachelor management studies bms degree<br>right through to being the first<br>management business school to launch a<br>digital business qualification<br>the first in new zealand and<br>one of the leaders in the world and<br>incorporating sustainability right at<br>the center of our strategy through to<br>the first in new zealand to achieve the<br>triple crown accreditation which places<br>us in the top 1 of business schools<br>globally and then even more recently in<br>the last six months<br>named is number one in new zealand for<br>business and economics and in the top<br>125 in the world and times higher<br>education rankings so when you look at<br>that and then look at the impact our<br>research has had and look at the impact<br>our alumni have had more than 24 000<br>students from prime ministers to ceos to<br>erie leaders to community leaders to<br>just fantastic people going out and<br>making a difference in the community<br>so<br>do<br>do<br>do<br>do<br>do<br>do<br>so<br>do<br>so<br>um<br>do<br>the<br>right<br>so<br>it's<br>kia ora and welcome back to the 2022 new<br>zealand economics forum hosted by the<br>university of waikato<br>had a great morning so far and we're<br>heading into a big afternoon<br>first up we will be having a session on<br>the business environment a panel<br>discussion on that followed by a session<br>on the maori economy<br>through the afternoon we're going to be<br>looking at economic disparity uh going<br>to be looking at labor immigration and<br>productivity such a critical issue at<br>the moment coming off an incredible two<br>years<br>with the border closures followed<br>by the right honourable jim bulger who<br>will close us out for some reflections<br>on leading in times of change so another<br>big afternoon with a lot of territory to<br>cover i'm going to hand over to you now<br>stephen to lead us through the session<br>on the business environment thanks matt<br>uh so yes the business environment well<br>it has been a game of many halves if you<br>like for businesses around the country<br>if you're in the primary sector<br>uh your prices are gangbusters and the<br>hardest thing you've got to do is find<br>the people to do the work to get your<br>product to market similar story in<br>construction although that may change<br>with the reserve bank's efforts this<br>last day or so<br>and they're they're signaling of a 3.4<br>percent ocr<br>then you have the tech sector who are<br>struggling to bring what we used to what<br>we might have used to call manufacturing<br>in a way but it's now very much high<br>tech i t and so on uh struggling to get<br>the people to continue their growth<br>and then the sector that's done it<br>toughest at all<br>and that's the services sector and in<br>particular people providing human<br>services tourism education uh getting a<br>haircut hospitality and they are<br>absolutely uh<br>struggling<br>some to the point of closing their<br>businesses either permanently or<br>temporarily and that's the nature of<br>this pandemic layout over the top though<br>the government has its own regulatory<br>reform agenda particularly in the<br>resource industries sector and climate<br>change and the environment and so on and<br>also in the labor market where they have<br>plans significant changes to unfold in<br>the next couple of years to help us<br>navigate this in this next session i<br>have three guests who know exactly what<br>they're talking about very knowledgeable<br>and right in this wheelhouse firstly<br>craig rennie who's economist and<br>director of public policy at the new<br>zealand council of trade unions<br>we have mike burrow who's the executive<br>director of the sustainable business<br>council and we'll follow them up with<br>brian chapel who's the deputy secretary<br>macroeconomics and growth at new zealand<br>treasury<br>so welcome gentlemen and we'll start<br>with you if we can craig i think you're<br>there yes there is uh and uh g'day to<br>you um what we'd like is from everybody<br>is just sort of five to seven minutes of<br>laying out your stall um the key points<br>you want to make and then we'll get to<br>the conversations and the questions uh<br>where we we get to talking about amongst<br>ourselves which i think is probably the<br>highest value part of the session so<br>craig welcome and fire into it<br>thank you steven for that introduction<br>um i hope you'll continue to be as kind<br>at the end of my speech<br>and i'd also like to thank waikato<br>university for providing with me the<br>opportunity to talk with you today<br>um we've been asked to talk about<br>navigating a changing regulatory<br>environment for businesses and for me<br>let's be clear all governments regulate<br>they regulate because they perceive a<br>problem in the economy or society that<br>requires rules they regulate to correct<br>the balance as professor van der hayden<br>the chair and regulatory practice at<br>victoria university states proper<br>regulation is not about restrictions or<br>limitations but rather about providing<br>equal opportunity and protecting<br>individuals from harm<br>sometimes this works the creation of acc<br>was essentially the creation of a set of<br>regulations it means that those who have<br>accidents receive support and we don't<br>have ambulance chasing lawyers on tv new<br>zealand is arguably much better off as a<br>consequence<br>sometimes it doesn't work the leaky<br>homes crisis was caused by regulation<br>failure as mr joyce will tell you it's<br>cost the government 12 and a half<br>billion dollars to fix and will continue<br>to cost more in the future<br>poor regulation or the poor application<br>of regulations can cause real harm and<br>there are few areas of life that<br>regulation does not touch<br>from the quality of the air we breathe<br>to the nutrition of the food we eat to<br>the slightly more terminal 1973<br>crematorium regulations they are<br>ubiquitous<br>but they are necessary<br>i haven't heard what my fellow panelists<br>might burrell is going to say today but<br>i would be astonished if he didn't say<br>that further government action was<br>necessary on climate change<br>action is necessary because for too long<br>we thought that our atmosphere was just<br>a free good that didn't require<br>regulation<br>the concern that some of you may hold is<br>that now is not the time to be making<br>further changes to regulations that our<br>recovery from covert will be freshened<br>up if we just paired back rules that we<br>should be cognizant of the overall<br>burden of regulation<br>as my former boss brian chappell used to<br>tell me we should take a system-wide<br>view of regulation whilst doing so we<br>should not forget that according to the<br>world bank new zealand is the best<br>country in the world to be a business<br>with the most business friendly<br>regulations<br>in my view regulation is a tool it's a<br>tool to help you deliver the kind of<br>economy you want to see and to manage<br>poor behaviors the government's economic<br>plan calls for the building of a more<br>productive sustainable and inclusive<br>economy and its overall aim is to<br>improve the well-being of new zealanders<br>and their families<br>the ctu backs that aspiration as i would<br>i hope many of you here today<br>the volume of regulation or the level of<br>regulatory change provided is actually<br>pretty unimportant what is important is<br>that regulation effectively implemented<br>helps to deliver on that policy in<br>that's why it's right for the government<br>to be delivering on its agenda for<br>regulatory change in environment in<br>industrial relations<br>even with unemployment at record lows we<br>can still point to sectors where job<br>insecurity low wages poor attempts and<br>conditions arrive where the costs of<br>competition are loaded onto workers<br>where health and safety is not the<br>priority it should be<br>that's why fair pay agreements are<br>essential to deliver both better<br>workplaces and sectors more focused on<br>product innovation and higher<br>productivity that's what we see now in<br>both australia and germany that already<br>have sector-level bargaining<br>that's why social unemployment insurance<br>is essential both the ctu and businesses<br>union have endorsed the proposals<br>because there's an opportunity to build<br>a better way much like we did with acc<br>according to motu wage scoring costs<br>workers 15 billion dollars and are lost<br>in a recession year<br>according to nzir employers number one<br>problem right now is a lack of access to<br>skills<br>we have a skills mismatching problem<br>that the current system creates and<br>entrenches<br>social insurance will provide better<br>opportunities for up skilling and career<br>transition and it will encourage the<br>sort of equitable structural change<br>missing from new zealand's economic<br>history it's exactly the more dynamic<br>market many economists have called for<br>this is why the government's reform<br>regulations around worker exploitation<br>are essential<br>some workers operate in a gray area<br>where they're treated like employees or<br>considered self-employed misclassified<br>workers miss out on basic employment<br>rights payment of at least the minimum<br>wage holidays paid leave and the right<br>to a proper process if fired are made<br>redundant<br>this harms workers it also puts a<br>disadvantage those businesses doing the<br>right thing<br>the race to the bottom just creates an<br>environment in which product and service<br>levels are of second order importance to<br>cost and it passes on the cost of that<br>regular lack of regulatory clarity to<br>others in the form of higher in-work<br>welfare and tax credits<br>now reasonable people can disagree about<br>what the government is doing<br>but it's been elected to deliver on its<br>agenda and that also means the delivery<br>of regulation that it believes will<br>deliver on that outcome<br>in my view the business community and<br>workers in new zealand have nothing to<br>fear and plenty to gain from these<br>changes<br>so how can businesses best navigate<br>these changes<br>my answer is engage<br>engage with workers and their<br>representatives to make the most of the<br>opportunities these changes will bring<br>an example here would be the high<br>performance high engagement work<br>commenced by christopher luxon at new<br>zealand now being rolled out elsewhere<br>working together with unions it<br>delivered higher output lower cost and a<br>safer company as mr luxon called it it<br>was about ending the punch and judy show<br>between workers and management<br>leading firms recognize that<br>understanding their regulatory<br>environment is as much a part of their<br>business as their product or service and<br>according to the 2020 ez and consumer<br>survey it's also increasingly part of<br>what customers and clients want to<br>that service that was becoming<br>increasingly important for businesses to<br>ensure they are meeting their legal<br>employment standards and to have the<br>appropriate systems in place to ensure<br>worker well-being<br>but let's go back to professor van der<br>hayden to end<br>as he said regulation is not about<br>restrictions or limitations it's about<br>providing equal opportunities and<br>protecting individuals from harm<br>the proposed changes to industrial<br>relations in new zealand help level the<br>playing field<br>they're also about reducing the harms<br>and rebalancing the costs that we see<br>from the current regulatory systems that<br>we have in place today<br>more importantly they're also about<br>delivering on the government's economic<br>goal of that more productive that more<br>sustainable and that more inclusive<br>economy<br>thank you<br>thank you very much craig<br>i'm sure there's much for discussion<br>there um one thing i do think we could<br>probably all agree on is the aspiration<br>um i've never doubted the aspiration on<br>both the left and right of the political<br>spectrum to deliver a more productive<br>and equitable economy for this country<br>the challenge is of course the method by<br>which is done which we will discuss over<br>the course of the next uh 30-yard uh<br>30-odd minutes 35<br>let's go then to mike burrell who's the<br>executive director of the sustainable<br>business council and that of course<br>related to business new zealand uh mike<br>uh i'm sure we'll have a few things to<br>say on what craig's said but also is<br>particularly interested in the whole<br>resource area our environmental concerns<br>and climate change so mike<br>all g'day<br>thanks steven<br>well look calm i think it won't cover<br>any surprise to anyone who's listening<br>to that today that i'll be looking at<br>this through a sustainable business lens<br>to start with release tonight i just<br>really want to make four points um the<br>first one is that in many countries<br>including new zealand businesses are<br>leading the way on sustainability and<br>climate action so<br>sustainable businesses like the ones i<br>represent in the sustainable business<br>council have been moving from seeing<br>sustainability as a bolt-on something<br>that you do in addition to your core<br>business to seeing it as something that<br>should be built into your core business<br>strategy over the last five years and<br>we're seeing more of that tune up in<br>those business strategies so these<br>businesses see that it just it's just<br>good practice since sustainable business<br>is about foresight it's about looking<br>ahead to anticipate risk and opportunity<br>and then responding to those elements<br>that are material to your business<br>so this mainstream of mainstreaming of<br>sustainability is evident both<br>internationally and here domestically<br>and we see it across a broad range of<br>sectors but we're also seeing pressure<br>coming from within the private sector as<br>investors like blackrock begin to signal<br>that they'll disinvest from companies<br>that aren't sustainable as um as<br>customers and uh clients begin to demand<br>more sustainable businesses as credit<br>rating agencies like moody's and<br>standard poor's now front load their<br>conversations with companies with a<br>session on sustainability employment<br>risk<br>you see banks like westpac and others<br>who are developing sustainable finance<br>products and insurance companies like<br>iag and others who are beginning to<br>focus on climate adaptation so a lot of<br>the pressure on companies is coming<br>actually from within the private sector<br>itself<br>and as we've seen in countries like the<br>uk it is the action from the private<br>sector that's having the most<br>significant impact on climate admissions<br>reduction and this is largely being led<br>by businesses themselves because they<br>see both the risk of not taking action<br>and of course the opportunity to adapt<br>into that new reality and the risk of<br>not taking it churn there and their<br>competitors taking it for them the<br>second point i wanted to make is that<br>we're currently in the midst of a very<br>major policy shift on climate action at<br>the point that uh the crane just made<br>before both globally and also here in<br>new zealand and it's an enormous amount<br>that's happening in terms of climate and<br>sustainability related regulation and<br>government policy and really what i<br>wanted to do is just<br>list a few of those things to give you<br>an idea of flavor just at the scale of<br>it so we've got the reform of the rma<br>we've got the outcomes of the climate<br>change commissions report which came out<br>last year and the government's response<br>to that through the draft emissions<br>reduction plan and that includes of<br>course finalizing emissions budgets for<br>the next 15 years which of course are<br>critical because they set the trajectory<br>and determine whether or not we'll meet<br>our climate goals or not and for that<br>reason of course they need to endure<br>across governments and so need to have<br>bipartisan support so that they're based<br>on independent advice and science and<br>don't go backwards and forwards<br>um<br>the work that's emerging from the<br>haywalker economic work that's uh to<br>reduce agricultural emissions is another<br>big piece of work that's coming down the<br>pipes there's the introduction of<br>mandatory climate-related financial<br>disclosures led by the erb<br>and of course there's the development of<br>the national adaptation plan um which is<br>i think coming out in a couple of months<br>time now in other like-minded countries<br>like the uk and<br>many other countries in the eu that work<br>unfolded over a quite a long time frame<br>but here in new zealand it's happening<br>in a very short time largely because<br>we're playing catch-up and across a wide<br>range of areas against the backdrop of<br>the global pandemic and the associated<br>economic challenges that were outlined<br>earlier<br>which is why my third point is why<br>partnering with business and the<br>development and implementation of all<br>that policy is critical if we want to<br>avoid the kinds of economic and social<br>shocks that we saw in the 1980s and<br>1990s when we didn't anticipate what the<br>intended attitude consequences might be<br>of those reforms so our view is that<br>it's really important that this work is<br>sequenced and that we work at a pace<br>that new zealanders can adapt to<br>otherwise we risk harming new zealanders<br>in the process or triggering a backlash<br>because we've not brought the public<br>along with us so we think that<br>government has a critical role in<br>setting a regulatory environment that<br>encourages businesses to make those<br>investments necessary for low-carbon<br>transition they also have a role for<br>making some investments themselves<br>particularly when it comes to the just<br>transition r d and other infrastructure<br>um<br>but what we've seen in other countries<br>like the uk is where the enabling role<br>of government is there you see a massive<br>investment by businesses and<br>decarbonisation and in fact well over 70<br>percent of the uh of the reduction in<br>emissions in the uk has actually come<br>out of the private sector<br>we see a just transition starting with a<br>conversation about where the impacts are<br>most likely to be felt and ensuring that<br>government is working in partnership<br>with businesses and communities to<br>mitigate those impacts so that we don't<br>see what we saw happen back in the 80s<br>and 90s<br>so this is a climate emergency and so<br>urgent action is needed but we need to<br>ensure that the unintended consequences<br>of those actions aren't harmful we think<br>the way to do that is to learn from<br>those who are ahead of us like the uk<br>and others and to work across government<br>business and communities<br>my fourth point is that when it comes to<br>climate action we need to learn how to<br>walk and chew gum at the same time we<br>already live in a world that's a 1.1<br>degree is one 1.1 degrees warmer than it<br>was at the start of the industrial<br>revolution so climate change is already<br>here and even if we take the action<br>necessary to limit warming it's likely<br>that by the end of the century we'll be<br>living in a 1.5 degree world for a<br>period of time until the impacts of our<br>actions are felt in global calling this<br>means that we need to work on both<br>climate mitigation it's reducing<br>emissions and climate adaptation at the<br>same time<br>and many businesses are just getting<br>their head around reducing their<br>emissions and now they've got to get<br>their head around how they adapt this<br>climate that's going to continue to<br>change for at least the next 50 years or<br>more<br>so we've kicked off some work in this<br>area in the anticipation of the draft<br>national adaptation plan and we<br>anticipate that the impacts on climate<br>adaptation will be every bit as<br>significant for new zealand businesses<br>as climate mitigation has been and so<br>being able to take action on both<br>mitigation and education is going to be<br>really important uh for business<br>but that's all i'm going to kick off<br>with today um stephen and now looking<br>forward to the questions and answers<br>that cartoons<br>thanks very much mike uh comprehensive<br>view on uh<br>on the impact particularly of climate<br>change in a very short space of time so<br>well done uh now brian chapel from the<br>treasury our second treasury speaker of<br>the day we had the secretary carolee and<br>earlier brian um i suppose<br>uh i'm interested from a treasury<br>perspective<br>you've just heard sort of two passionate<br>discussions about firstly the labour<br>market and then<br>climate change from two different<br>perspectives what's treasury<br>keeping an eye on um in all this uh<br>environment<br>well thanks steven and uh kyoto koto and<br>i'll try not to contradict uh my boss as<br>you've uh helpfully pointed out she<br>spoke earlier um<br>look i'm not going to presume to tell<br>businesses how to navigate the<br>environment but i do think there's a few<br>kind of themes that are going on here<br>and it's kind of useful to think about<br>the types of regulation that are<br>happening differently but first i do<br>just want to pick up on something you<br>said at the beginning stephen about<br>covid and just acknowledge that<br>it's having very different impacts on<br>different types of businesses and i i<br>don't think i've seen as a sort of such<br>extreme heterogeneity in different parts<br>of the economy in my career so i think<br>we do have to be really cognizant of<br>that when we're thinking about<br>regulation in the way in which it's<br>going to land right it's not we can't go<br>back to some of these kind of<br>one-size-fits-all type approaches and<br>kind of think that because on average<br>the cost benefit says it's positive it's<br>kind of positive because the impacts are<br>going to be<br>really quite different<br>just thinking about the two areas that<br>craig and mike have talked about i think<br>they're quite different in nature so the<br>labor market ones and i'd include<br>immigration in there<br>they're sort of one-off i think of them<br>as one-off there's a whole lot of them<br>but they're kind of a big set of changes<br>um maybe a shift in the pendulum if you<br>like and<br>you know then business can kind of<br>you know whether they like it or not uh<br>can kind of get on and operate in that<br>new environment and there's kind of<br>certainty um about what that is right as<br>i say whether or not you agree with them<br>this kind of certainty i think the key<br>thing we've been thinking about there is<br>um<br>just the scale of those changes at once<br>and uh how do we make sure that they<br>don't undermine you know the ends that<br>they're trying to achieve which i think<br>as you said as well you know we all kind<br>of agree with the ends the aims but you<br>know<br>you know with a lot of things happening<br>all at once it's quite difficult to work<br>out what that end impact is going to be<br>and how all this is going to play out so<br>that's that the way we're approaching<br>those issues i think the resources and<br>climate<br>ones are different and that they are the<br>start of a longer term trend i think<br>we're going to see ongoing change in<br>those areas as we get to grip with the<br>kind of transition that we're we're<br>going to see<br>and i think in part that um you know<br>that's kind of about ensuring our<br>economic model is sustainable for the<br>long term<br>um and and i think of it as pricing<br>externalities and just getting those<br>underlying incentives right for the<br>economy that's the sort of basic<br>the other kind of point i'd make about<br>that is for both climate and adaptation<br>uh sorry climate mitigation and<br>adaptation you've got to think about<br>both the transition costs and what the<br>end point is going to be like so the<br>climate commission modeling suggested<br>that the endpoint for the economy won't<br>be all that different from what it would<br>have been without this transition yep<br>there's a bit of a negative impact but<br>it's not<br>what's well within the margins of error<br>of any kind of economic forecast going<br>up to 2050 let's put it that way<br>but what we haven't really focused on or<br>talked about is how we're going to share<br>the burden of the transition cost across<br>the private sector both business and<br>individuals and also across the<br>government clearly government's going to<br>fund some of it and some of it is going<br>to be<br>both incentivizing the change and um<br>compensating some of the people who are<br>losers on the way through or who are<br>adversely impacted on the way through<br>but i think most of the burden's going<br>to fall on the private sector via a mix<br>of both kind of relative price changes<br>and regulation<br>but importantly even where the<br>government does<br>fund some of these things it's really<br>important that<br>we are altering relative prices<br>so that those um to support that<br>underlying investment otherwise you<br>really like ken kanute<br>kind of standing there trying to fund<br>something and the underlying forces in<br>the economy are pushing you in a<br>different direction and<br>kind of that way lies madness so i think<br>it is really important um on my biggest<br>um<br>kind of i guess piece of context or way<br>of thinking about this massive climate<br>and resourcing change we're undergoing<br>is to think really hard about the<br>underlying relative prices and sort of<br>incentives and economic signals that we<br>need to be sending for the long term and<br>get those clear so that then people can<br>start operating in a coherent way and<br>although i said we're not really going<br>to get certainty about how all this<br>locks at least you can start<br>getting some sense of direction from<br>that<br>the final sort of<br>kind of observation i'd make about the<br>regulatory changes is you know as craig<br>pointed out<br>governments are elected and and have a<br>mandate to make changes and in<br>particular areas they they want to do<br>and um my job is to give them some um<br>really good advice and then<br>enthusiastically uh let<br>help them do whatever it is they decide<br>to do<br>and and that's the nature of the role<br>but i think you know<br>for people like me it's really important<br>we have a really good understanding of<br>the impacts on business and more so than<br>usual the impacts on different types of<br>business and how that's going to vary<br>across<br>given the covert context and then<br>communicate that clearly to ministers so<br>they make their decisions i think the<br>other kind of observation i'd make is<br>that within the um<br>you know within that regulatory change<br>there's often a lot of tiny little<br>details that the decisions that get<br>taken that make quite a difference to<br>the actual costs on the ground for<br>businesses and often we can make quite a<br>difference to those without you know<br>even while doing the going in the<br>direction the government's chosen to do<br>and achieving its broader objectives you<br>can make things much more simpler and<br>straightforward for business to do that<br>if we can work together on some of those<br>implementation details better and<br>there's any number of examples where we<br>don't get that done well uh and some<br>where we do so i think that is you know<br>just echoing mike's plea for business<br>stakeholders and government to work<br>together to make it work<br>and just finally a point on the broader<br>business environment clearly um free<br>flow of people is going to be very<br>important too and no doubt that's<br>something that will be touched on<br>throughout the rest of the two days but<br>i'll stop there stephen and um and let<br>you lead us through a discussion<br>thanks very much brian um that was great<br>the and and to all our speakers just<br>before i go back to the other panel<br>members uh one of the things uh<br>carolee was asked about this morning was<br>this whole question of who measures the<br>costs and benefits of different regular<br>initiatives and who's there<br>looking at the cumulative effect and you<br>mentioned it in relation to the labor<br>market<br>as you and i would both know<br>relying on individual agencies<br>to come up with robust cost benefit<br>analyses and so on<br>is variable um if we could put it that<br>way and so there is a role for treasury<br>but i also realized that treasury<br>uh is is has got to be a mile wide and<br>an inch deep really because you're<br>covering the whole of government<br>activity<br>have you thought and have you considered<br>for example in labor market reforms<br>immigration and so on<br>of perhaps putting together a more sort<br>of<br>uh given that that's a big error of<br>government activity a more sort of<br>robust<br>group of people with a specific whether<br>you call it a task force or whatever<br>with a specific mindset of understanding<br>those cumulative effects<br>better before they all happen<br>no but i think that is something we um<br>we need to think about i think that i<br>mean one area where i've seen government<br>try to do it is on the agricultural<br>sector where again a lot of these<br>environmental um<br>changes are kind of hitting but um we<br>have kind of thought about it in a site<br>abstract way in the labour market but<br>not in that kind of comprehensive way i<br>mean part of the challenge of doing it<br>is that the way in which even the labor<br>market regulations will affect<br>businesses will vary quite a lot between<br>businesses so<br>you know if you're a minimum wage<br>or sit close to that retail business for<br>example it's going to be very different<br>than if you're a you know a tech<br>business kind of thing so<br>it's hard to do<br>okay great thanks<br>let's stay with the labor market then<br>for the moment and craig<br>obviously as a representative of workers<br>in terms of ctu and so on<br>um<br>you'll obviously be keen to ensure that<br>everybody still has lots of work<br>there's a theme running around in some<br>business circles which is<br>that yeah we could be careful we could<br>break<br>break the sector a little bit if we rush<br>too hard and i know you did address that<br>a bit<br>but um i think it is a concern<br>and and also potentially a concern about<br>the competitiveness of international<br>facing businesses<br>and i suppose the unique aspect of this<br>country is just how small and thinly<br>spread we are<br>and i think of regional businesses you<br>know where you're the local<br>pub or whatever and you really are<br>you know you're struggling to just make<br>a buck um and uh and i suppose from a<br>ctu's perspective understanding the<br>direction you want to head down and what<br>the government wants to do<br>but do you think about<br>these<br>these potential externalities and<br>potential risks to perhaps particularly<br>regional areas and so on um from such<br>things as the fear power agreements<br>thanks david yeah certainly um you know<br>the ctu wants as many people to be<br>employed in good work as is possible<br>um so we want to live it we want to have<br>a minimum wage which supports the<br>aspiration of having as many people to<br>be in good work as possible and that<br>applies equally across the country um<br>fortunately for us the evidence on<br>things like the minimum wage and from<br>overseas and from other jurisdictions is<br>that for every 10<br>increase in the minimum wage general<br>prices rise by 0.4 percent um so you<br>know the evidence on things like the<br>minimum wage increases is is quite small<br>um in terms of price rises but certainly<br>one of the things we take into<br>consideration in terms of fair pay<br>agreements and the proposal that's on as<br>i understand that that's being discussed<br>um has the possibility um um of um you<br>know of providing for regional or local<br>variations<br>um and<br>as a you know there will be sector-led<br>um agreements which will be freely<br>bargained between um employers and<br>employees to commence with so they'll be<br>they'll be dealt with from bargaining<br>sides on both sides so you know and<br>clearly<br>the employment impacts of whatever goes<br>into a fair agreement and we're clearly<br>one of the things that we'll be talking<br>to the bargaining sites for trade unions<br>on but i'm sure it's one of the<br>considerations that unions will be<br>considering in setting and helping to<br>set a fair pay agreement for an<br>occupation or a sector<br>okay thanks<br>um mike what's your<br>uh feedback from from members i mean<br>obviously your direct interest to<br>sustainable business council but you<br>also have a involvement in the wider<br>business new zealand set up<br>what's your feedback<br>from members at the moment in terms of<br>pace the regulation i appreciate it<br>might be different from the beginning of<br>town to the little guys<br>you know your chambers of commerce and<br>emas and so on not so little the ema but<br>anyway um<br>all that<br>uh what's your what's your read of the<br>temperature check of of businesses at<br>the moment<br>yeah maybe i'll start with the area that<br>i just talked about um<br>i think the sense on um<br>on the sustainability side of regulation<br>is that there was a lot of catching up<br>to do and that some of that stuff had<br>been on agendas for quite some time the<br>rma reform was one of them that was on<br>the to-do list i think of a range of<br>uh governments over the years and so um<br>you know that's accepted that that's<br>going to be some pain for hopefully a<br>good outcome um and same with<br>the the work on emissions you know that<br>there was a bit of catching up to do<br>we'd fallen well behind our peer group<br>particularly the uk and others and there<br>was some catching up to do there i think<br>the concern is just with the breadth of<br>it<br>there's just happening all at the same<br>time and<br>at a really challenging time you know<br>this is a time where companies are you<br>know fearful for their own survival in<br>many cases and so one of the things that<br>we've talked to the government about is<br>is the be kind strategy<br>which is uh um we're really keen for<br>this to happen um we've done<br>not a lot for the previous 30 years um<br>we're now trying to cram 30 years worth<br>of work into two<br>we would rather see that happen in a<br>slightly slower pace and we're not<br>saying don't you know don't do it and<br>we're not saying don't lose the momentum<br>we're just saying make sure that you do<br>it at a pace that people can keep up<br>with that the companies can keep up with<br>particularly this morning to town<br>because um you know the larger companies<br>you know<br>have a bit more go on uh come and go on<br>this<br>i think the the point the question that<br>you asked brian earlier is a really<br>important one which is what is the<br>cumulative effect of what we're doing<br>here and i think the answer is i'm not<br>sure any of us really know because we're<br>doing a lot of you know quite<br>significant reform all at the same time<br>with the backdrop of you know the<br>largest<br>um you know crisis that the planet's<br>seen probably since the oil crisis in<br>the uh 70s possibly you'd have to go<br>back to world war ii to see something<br>that's significant so the truth is we<br>don't know and i i would like to see<br>some work done on what the uh cumulative<br>impact of this will be because i think<br>then that then we can make some choices<br>about sequencing you know what are we<br>doing<br>at what time<br>i worry that what we'll do is we will do<br>a classic new zealand thing of trying to<br>rush it all through<br>and then we will spend years trying to<br>unpick some of that and do it better<br>what i would rather do is we do it you<br>know my father's uh added you know<br>measure twice cut once um and i'm not<br>talking about years here i'm just<br>talking about you know the next<br>year two years i'd like to see some<br>sequencing<br>the other thing that we are seeing is<br>that the issue of um<br>when we ask our members what the biggest<br>issue on their mind at the moment is in<br>fact we go out to new zealand just<br>generally and ask them about that<br>in the top 10<br>five of them are about<br>standard of living<br>they're about affordability they're it's<br>interesting they're really crowding out<br>in fact of the top five four of them are<br>economic<br>and that's a huge difference from two<br>years ago and so what we're having to do<br>as an organization is kind of tilt into<br>that area around if you like the social<br>part of esg you know normally we we're<br>more focused on the environmental now<br>we're realizing that actually the impact<br>on um<br>uh people's lives of of just the last<br>two years really has been really<br>significant so<br>what we're hearing from our members and<br>i see it as being part of the broader<br>business new zealand network is just<br>that this the social and economic cost<br>of this um of this um<br>this crisis hasn't really come to bear<br>yet let's be honest we've been dancing<br>with her we've been shadow boxing hope<br>that happens now it hasn't actually been<br>here now we're about to experience the<br>real thing and so we're watching that<br>carefully and making sure that we go at<br>a pace that our businesses can adapt to<br>thanks very much uh mike the<br>well a couple of our questions have come<br>up with questions which i might<br>introduce at the moment which was a<br>thick<br>reflect a theme that a couple of you<br>raised already which is the quality of<br>implementation of policy<br>one particular question about the<br>current credit legislation which uh<br>suggests that you know an implementation<br>it hasn't been that<br>stellar i think is probably the term<br>and i think there's certainly some some<br>appearances that that's indeed the case<br>and you'd have to say looking at that<br>one there were plenty of people saying<br>ahead of time who you pull up um there's<br>going to be a problem here if you<br>proceed on this basis<br>and so there was no shortage of people<br>prepared to<br>to offer a view but for whatever reason<br>it didn't quite make it through to the<br>minister's table<br>uh and<br>uh and therefore and probably using that<br>as an example of the wider question of<br>implementation how good are we at it<br>really<br>and<br>what could we do better<br>you know beyond just talking to each<br>other because sometimes people talk and<br>you know i've been at select committee<br>submissions arrive<br>they're very good submissions well<br>argued um and they sort of go into a big<br>box<br>um and the minister charges on<br>regardless um and that's on both sides<br>of politics he said quickly and so how<br>do we how do we do that bit better uh<br>because with a lot with a lot going on<br>uh things are things you know the risk<br>has got to be pretty high let's start<br>with brian as the man in the hot seat um<br>and then we'll go to craig<br>yeah so um i'm not going to talk about<br>the triple cfa in any detail and just<br>let that play out for the time being but<br>i i agree with the general point if i<br>think about recent regulatory failures<br>um we've had around health and safety uh<br>you know the leaky building the um<br>finance company one um that i was<br>involved in some of the aftermath of in<br>the past and the gfc you know a lot of<br>those are actually not not so much about<br>the frameworks we've had but about the<br>way we've ended up doing kind of<br>enforcement and kind of that back in the<br>frontline stuff i think we have actually<br>got a lot better at that so there's been<br>some um<br>you know stuff that actually was<br>probably started when you were involved<br>in this um<br>stephen uh like g-reg you know<br>professionalizing some of the frontline<br>regulators giving them qualifications<br>and things like that so i think there<br>are things that are happening there but<br>uh it has been a bit of a a weak spot<br>where we've tended to concentrate you<br>know people like me do the framework<br>stuff um and then you know both<br>ministers and<br>and the policymakers move on to the next<br>thing and we don't think about how it's<br>actually going to happen and play it on<br>the ground enough<br>craig what about you<br>you must be concerned about access to<br>credit and things for businesses as part<br>of your remit that's particular example<br>but also more broadly<br>uh on the in the area of of<br>implementation<br>i'm sure i mean<br>i'm first of all shocked um uh stephen<br>that you suggest that politicians don't<br>listen um to people um you know i<br>followed that statement um however um<br>what i would say is that you know again<br>like brian there's a process underway<br>with the review of the triple cfa and<br>you know and i won't talk to that now<br>but what i would say is that the triple<br>c fa reforms were probably in themselves<br>an attempt to regulate a regulatory<br>failure um because we had a lot of<br>situations in which we had predatory<br>lending we had poor forms of lending<br>going on to households um who couldn't<br>afford to actually pay the lending in<br>the first place and you know i we're<br>doing a lot of work with fincap and with<br>households who you know have clearly um<br>had missed selling of financial services<br>delivered delivered to them and to our<br>members and that's really you know so<br>what we shouldn't do is seek to throw<br>the baby out with the bath water by<br>saying our regulation didn't work<br>therefore we should stop that regulation<br>and deliver a completely different<br>regulation what we should recognize is<br>that many of the problems that we have<br>are actually the consequences of<br>previous regulatory failings arguably<br>you know one of the biggest regulatory<br>feelings we have right now is the<br>housing crisis in new zealand and 30 to<br>40 years of failure to regulate land<br>supply failure to regulate and building<br>demand failure to regulate the the the<br>number of construction firms that we<br>have in the sector properly and so to<br>deliver the kinds of outcomes that we<br>actually want to see that's why i said<br>at the beginning of it in my my speech<br>the it's not it's not about the number<br>of regulations it's about making sure<br>that the regulations that you have are<br>delivering on your goal and and for me<br>certainly you know the you know the<br>ability to implement the regulations and<br>that we've got in new zealand we should<br>learn from what we've done in the past<br>and i think that's where sometimes we<br>fail a little bit in new zealand as we<br>we seek to regulate without seeking to<br>learn properly why we're needing to<br>regulate what's failed in the past in<br>the first place<br>yep<br>sort of increased thoughtfulness i<br>wonder sometimes too um this will be<br>heresy to my former colleagues um the<br>idea of of having the select committee<br>is a little bit more independent of the<br>executive<br>i think would be a very worthwhile<br>exercise unfortunately in our country<br>well fortunately in some ways but<br>unfortunately others because everybody's<br>aspiring to get into the executive<br>you don't have what we have in the uk<br>which is often a much more independent<br>uh back bench and much more focused on<br>scrutiny<br>of of pieces of legislation uh michael<br>are you any views in this particular<br>area i i do steve i haven't both sides<br>of the fence of course i've got some<br>peace offers um i suppose my first thing<br>would be to say that<br>what i observe is that when the private<br>sector wants to go about doing something<br>it really throws a lot of resource into<br>it<br>and what i've observed having worked in<br>government and worked as a consultant to<br>government and now working alongside<br>them as a partner is a chronic under<br>resourcing on big projects<br>uh but big policy projects i mean you<br>know the sense is uh once the policy is<br>signed off it's done<br>um whereas in fact the hard work begins<br>at that stage so i would say that we<br>um<br>we're not great at execution as a<br>country i think we uh we kind of we wing<br>it and as a result um i think a lot of<br>our work is is not as good as it should<br>be<br>the exception to that was um some of the<br>work that we did i think uh in the late<br>80s and early 90s when we did throw the<br>kitchen sink out in terms of resources<br>and we attracted a lot of talenting to<br>do that work i would say that we haven't<br>done that in quite some time so that's<br>my<br>comment on that one my other comment<br>would just be to say that we don't learn<br>from overseas again and again our<br>parochialism is legendary globally um i<br>worked in uh foreign affairs for ireland<br>you know we are known as being hyper<br>parochial people won't say it to our<br>faces but if they think you're an<br>australian they'll tell you um and um<br>you know we really are an island<br>a little group of islanders and we don't<br>like to learn from others even if it's<br>even if there's a model we can grab and<br>my class i mean i could give you<br>hundreds of more examples of this but um<br>i've seen it happen half a dozen times<br>where there was something a piece of<br>technology we could have grabbed from<br>somewhere for very little money or an<br>idea that we could have ripped off and<br>implemented in new zealand but no<br>we have to come up with something from<br>the ground up that makes no sense i say<br>to people it's kind of like developing<br>your own word processor fun but stupid<br>and we do that i think we do that far<br>too often and then my final point on<br>this i suppose would just be around<br>the<br>the rate of change you know we we we<br>love to fiddle we love to meddle and to<br>your point um you know uh you know there<br>was a little book written back in the uh<br>late 70s wasn't it uh uh by jeffrey<br>palmer<br>that originally had a christian mark and<br>then we got rid of the question<br>unbridled<br>um you know the reforms that were done<br>around our um around our voting system<br>were actually a proxy for dealing with<br>uh executive overreach in the 70s but we<br>didn't actually address that so what we<br>have is a situation now we're<br>effectively we have a as jeffrey palmer<br>used to refer to as elected<br>dictatorships you know they can't<br>governments come in there's no<br>regulatory check there really and i<br>think that leads to some optimal<br>outcomes on the quality of our of our<br>work so your point i do think that if<br>there was a greater independence with<br>that scrutiny would end up with a better<br>product because in the end that's the<br>benefit of a liberal democracy isn't it<br>is it that's actual scrutiny of<br>legislation as the critical piece so<br>thank you very much look i just want to<br>change tech before we finish because<br>there's a big elephant in the room which<br>is probably troubling for everybody here<br>and that is inflation<br>now<br>and<br>what seems to be as an outsider looking<br>and i'm not being critical of the new<br>zealand reserve bank at this point uh<br>because i think it's a worldwide<br>phenomenon where central banks feel like<br>they've been dovish for too long<br>uh and now we're now we're fighting<br>inflation from behind the eight ball<br>how worried are the three of you about<br>that from a business perspective<br>and<br>and i'd be worried about a wage price<br>spiral and that's not to pick on<br>are people going for wage increases<br>because i certainly would but uh but<br>more a case of that that's the logical<br>outcome of this at least in the short<br>term particularly with a you know closed<br>off labor market from the rest of the<br>world uh yeah we've got some we've got<br>some real challenges ahead of us so<br>interested in your views let's start<br>perhaps with craig and uh and then mike<br>thanks steven i mean in terms of um to<br>answer your second question first and if<br>there's going to be you know is there<br>evidence of a wage price spiral we've<br>got evidence of the um the price spiral<br>we have 5.9 percent inflation we don't<br>necessarily have evidence of the wage<br>spiral to accompany it um you know lci<br>and so labor cost inflation um for<br>memory is is 2.8<br>um in the latest data set um and you<br>know even if you take um ordinary hourly<br>meaning wages it's nowhere near um the<br>current level of inflation um and<br>similarly<br>none of the forecasts see that that the<br>the level of wages reaching the level of<br>inflation and in any short run um<br>scenario i also think we also have a<br>very<br>bifurcated labor market um the recovery<br>that we've seen to date and cover is if<br>you have skills if you're in demand<br>you're doing well and you may well be<br>benefiting and from the recovery and<br>from the growth that we genuinely have<br>seen post covered<br>if you are not doing so well if perhaps<br>you don't have the skills that they<br>needed in the economy or you were in a<br>sector that was suffering to date then<br>you're probably continuing to see your<br>relative quality of life in comparison<br>to others decline and that k-shaped<br>recovery that some economists talk about<br>i can see that certainly continuing over<br>the time period that's why you know<br>lifts to the minimum wage are quite<br>important in order to create a flaw for<br>that to make sure that doesn't get us no<br>worse than<br>it positively could be so i don't see<br>the wage price spiral yet i certainly<br>see the prices rising but i don't<br>necessarily see the wages rising on the<br>other side do i think it's a real<br>problem for businesses going forward<br>well<br>to be honest there's a bunch of<br>economists who tell me that it's<br>permanent that it's here and that we're<br>inflation's out of control and you know<br>we need to lift the ocr regularly and<br>because it's a permanent issue now in<br>the economy and there's a bunch of<br>economists who tell me that frankly this<br>is a transient issue this is about oil<br>this is about shipping costs this is<br>about a bunch of other things and<br>they'll go away once the bottlenecks<br>ease<br>one of them will be right um you know<br>for my money i'm still in still more in<br>team transient than i am in team<br>permanent um but it will create real<br>issues and for businesses even in the<br>short run um you know in terms of<br>managing costs um but right now that<br>doesn't seem to be having a depressing<br>effect on economic activity<br>and so you know it may be that one of<br>the things you want to look at is<br>is does does the reserve bank with its<br>current ocr track see that having a<br>depressing effect on economic activity<br>and from memory the last mps continues<br>to see<br>economic growth going forward so i don't<br>think it's it's don't think it's<br>uh fantastic i don't think it's the most<br>important issue yet i think skills um<br>access to workers is probably the most<br>important issue and that's what the<br>surveys tell us for um for businesses<br>right now but if inflation became<br>permanent then clearly it would be a<br>very important issue for businesses<br>thank you craig<br>mike<br>just a quick comment from you it'll come<br>as no surprise that i'm very worried<br>about it um you know and<br>all you need to do is you know i'm you<br>know i've got a background in<br>development economics and so all you<br>need to do is look at developing<br>countries and see that uh<br>you know why are they still developing<br>because they've let inflation run away<br>time and time and time again i agree<br>with craig it's one of the set of things<br>that we need to be concerned about it's<br>not just one of them but it is something<br>we need to be concerned about i'm<br>confident that we've got the tools to<br>manage it um i mean i'd be interested in<br>you know how long was transient<br>i think it could be a year or two you<br>know um but i am confident that we could<br>we can get on top of it using the tools<br>that we have<br>but um i think you<br>you know you'd be full not to be focused<br>on it because we haven't been in a<br>situation with such high uh inflation<br>for a very long time but i i'm confident<br>we can get on top of that it is an<br>indicator though of just how different<br>these times are from the last 30 years<br>you know we are in something that looks<br>feels a bit more like the 70s to me than<br>it than it does the 80s or 90s and that<br>means that we're going to have to use<br>some you know some reasonably big tools<br>in our toolbox to manage that get things<br>back on track and then go from there<br>and before i go to brian i can report<br>from a number of companies that i work<br>with they're dusting off all their price<br>escalation clauses and everything else<br>um so it doesn't feel transitory to me<br>at this point everybody's trying to<br>re-learn things that they haven't had to<br>know since the 70s to<br>to ensure they don't get underwater with<br>what they sell<br>brian how big a problem<br>yep i think it's definitely an issue um<br>you know partly because we haven't seen<br>it for a while um although i share<br>mike's view that we have got the tools<br>but it could be a bumpy road and then<br>three other observations i think while i<br>don't regret any of the decisions we<br>took over the last couple of years i<br>think this turned out to be more of a<br>supply side event than a demand side<br>event and our initial response was you<br>know what we do in the demand side i<br>think so that's a you know me a cop a<br>bit of a lesson there for us two on<br>wages interestingly if you disaggregate<br>the lci by skill level it's the lowest<br>and the second lowest skill levels that<br>are seeing most of the big increases<br>coming through in wages so that's kind<br>of just interesting seeing where that<br>pressure is coming through and third how<br>this ultimately plays out is going to be<br>dependent on the housing market just<br>given that such a big part of our macro<br>transmission transmission mechanism here<br>in new zealand so i'll leave it there<br>and a big thanks to you stephen and to<br>my fellow panelists<br>thank you brian and i just we hear this<br>last minute disagreement between brian<br>and craig that we have no time to<br>actually go back and delve into which is<br>never mind we can do that later at some<br>point in the future look thanks very<br>much to the three of you uh for being<br>with us today and for your insights i<br>highly appreciate it as i said at one<br>point i'm sure everybody agrees on the<br>outcome there's just difference of<br>opinions on how we might get there which<br>is the nature of political economy<br>thank you very much for your time and<br>look forward to seeing you again at some<br>point soon and that is our session on<br>the business environment<br>the inflation discussion at the end is<br>probably a good lead into tomorrow where<br>we have the reserve bank governor in the<br>morning<br>followed by a panel of macroeconomic<br>economists<br>it's always bad to pronounce that<br>wrongly when you're when you're at an<br>economic forum<br>but that's tomorrow morning and we'll<br>get to that right now we have another<br>excellent panel and matt bulger to<br>introduce it thank you matt gotta thank<br>you stephen and<br>really interesting discussions there we<br>are switching gears we've got a couple<br>of great sessions before we have another<br>break uh<br>before the break we'll have a panel on<br>education of course hugely disrupted<br>during the pandemic but right now i'd<br>like to cut across to our panel on the<br>maori economy and facilitating<br>moderating<br>driving driving us for this session is<br>professor shelly spiller<br>shelley is a professor of leadership<br>within the waikato management school<br>tarou papa a global leader in her field<br>and she's joined by a couple of<br>fantastic panelists so kyoto shelly<br>great to see you up in auckland and<br>welcome and in your hands<br>um<br>welcome to our session on the maori<br>economy and in particular we're going to<br>be looking at dealing with coverts long<br>tail as matt mentioned i'm a professor<br>at the waikato management school and i<br>waka papa to my tahumata friti on the<br>east coast just out of wair<br>so we hear glittering headlines about<br>the size of the maori economy<br>pre-pandemic in 2018<br>the asset base of the maori economy was<br>68.7 billion which is a phenomenal 60<br>percent growth since 2013.<br>but actually what's in a number that<br>number<br>68.7 billion tells a particular story<br>of an economy that is underpinned by<br>maori values an intergenerational<br>outlook<br>stakeholders in perpetuity<br>well-being as a perfect purpose and<br>profit as a means to an end<br>so amidst the surge of covert and the<br>long tail that we are all collectively<br>facing we have two expert economic<br>matakite so visionaries who are working<br>in the maori economy<br>at the interface between world views so<br>it's a great pleasure to welcome liz<br>tiamour and wayne tainoui<br>liz and wayne will speak for about five<br>minutes each on our session topic and<br>then we will open up to questions from<br>the audience i really encourage you to<br>put your questions through slido<br>so i'll briefly introduce each speaker<br>and then i'll hand over to you first liz<br>so wayne first you have very well known<br>to us here at the waikato management<br>school you've been on our business<br>advisory board<br>for a number of years now and you've<br>been a key contributor to our amazing<br>new strategy<br>wayne is pwc's manukaura maori business<br>leader responsible for developing and<br>leading the firm's strategy for the<br>maori sector and he has considerable<br>knowledge on the maori economy in new<br>zealand commercial landscape<br>and liz<br>as i recall we last met when you were<br>awarded a maori business leader award<br>for the incredible work that you were<br>doing as executive director at mb<br>responsible for leading the national<br>crown maori economic development<br>strategy in partnership<br>but you've been ceo at middlebury's in<br>tauranga since i think 2018 and it's one<br>of those businesses that puts maori<br>ideals into practice as a collective and<br>as the website says<br>combines ancient traditions and values<br>handed down by the ancestors with modern<br>technology in science so welcome liz<br>and you need to unmute<br>real privilege to be here today that was<br>a bit of a trip down memory memory lane<br>um<br>my background i spent about 16 years<br>with new zealand new zealand trade and<br>enterprise<br>half of that offshore half onshore so<br>representing new zealand and exporters<br>in trade um<br>10 years in the private sector and then<br>two years with mb as<br>shelley said<br>working closely with ministers including<br>um stephen joyce<br>uh on<br>the maori economic development strategy<br>for the country<br>um and so i'm very grateful for that<br>career and that perspective and that<br>lens and where that took me to was a<br>place where<br>it was time for me to go home so coming<br>back to where i papa to in and<br>around to poke where my whanau was<br>and what i understood and knew was that<br>for maori um i wanted to go right from<br>this helicopter view of talking about<br>the 70 billion dollar maori economy to<br>actually growing maori businesses<br>because<br>that was going to be the job creator<br>that was going to change the lives of<br>our people um<br>in in our rural communities our rural<br>maori communities and so i joined this<br>little company called middle it means<br>barry and maori and<br>as we try to wrangle a horticultural<br>startup<br>an indigenous business model against<br>some very commercial drivers<br>that's the mission uh certainly i joined<br>for um<br>four years ago now and so at the heart<br>of metal what are we with 30<br>maori shareholders<br>um growing starting with blueberries<br>growing high value crops we grow in a<br>hydroponic styled<br>growing system so that's tunnels it's a<br>substrate it's a fertigation system so<br>it's at the high-tech end of growing<br>and now shareholders joined up with a<br>view to<br>understanding they had<br>investments in<br>farming and dairy and fish and forestry<br>and tourism they wanted to understand<br>what horticulture could offer them as<br>well that's why they joined but they<br>joined together<br>to be part of a maori collective one<br>that was very much underpinned by<br>tikanga<br>by our values of kotahitanga working<br>collectively kaitiakitanga<br>sustainability<br>mana kitanga<br>care of people in place so that was<br>critical to them when they joined up<br>they had aspirations of owning ip but<br>didn't necessarily know what that<br>might mean the investment required very<br>much horizon 3 activity and also<br>building a global maori brand one that<br>they could see themselves in but also it<br>had to resonate with uh global consumers<br>so that's the journey we've been on and<br>if i think about what we are today<br>over the last four years we now have um<br>10 orchards just finished harvesting 11<br>orchards in our network we start with<br>ngati kuri right up in ho horo come down<br>to naitihura<br>in moorensville out to matakana island<br>for toronto moana ngati pero and tolaga<br>bay along with houthi incorporation<br>weepers trust in gisborne biggest<br>orchards in teteko<br>mahanakwata trust<br>there<br>te ho arihou um in<br>bulls and then ngati nui out with six<br>hectares in<br>taranaki south taranaki there so we're<br>spread around the north island in terms<br>of our orchards uh and what the the<br>ambitious task we took on was growing<br>these varieties of blueberries uh in a<br>system that was that were new to new<br>zealand in a system that was new to new<br>zealand um with all the other parts of<br>the ambition why<br>it's important because it took me from a<br>macro level right down to a very micro<br>level of what these communities and i'll<br>settle on to tickle because that's where<br>our biggest orchards are<br>what they look like uh the ten people in<br>a household which we've all become a<br>little bit more familiar with over in<br>these covered times uh the<br>intergenerational nature the the<br>patience required the lack of capital<br>available to help maori land development<br>and so if they hold<br>to ko papa dear to their hearts in my<br>shareholders it's that we must grow over<br>our own land we must go over maori land<br>so that means most of the developments<br>are leasehold<br>and that we are focused on jobs and<br>skills for our people and when we<br>started this we went in<br>this somewhat more closed economy of<br>covert where the horticulture industry<br>had access to rscs that had access to a<br>lot of backpackers and so we started<br>with this notion of<br>no we're here for our own we're going to<br>be you know above 90<br>local maori employed<br>and so if i think about that vision and<br>those challenges and how we've been<br>wrangling that uh there's been many<br>uh challenges on the way<br>but where i go to i guess is uh in the<br>reserve bank governor this is adrian<br>moore's favorite little triangle uh<br>which he gave us is that triangle of uh<br>thinking about the key issues capital<br>capability and connectivity or<br>connection<br>uh so when you are just developing doing<br>developments over mighty leasehold land<br>that is very hard to sell at retail it's<br>very hard to sell to anyone but the<br>landowners<br>and their friends basically so<br>i know uh reserve bank people are<br>thinking about how you might unlock um<br>lending to maori land but that's a real<br>constraint about how we get the<br>potential of maori land moving second is<br>our capability and<br>i see it both as a<br>an opportunity and a challenge<br>we need to invest probably two to three<br>times more effort in getting our own<br>local maori people who have never had<br>the opportunities of<br>an education of regular income<br>three four generations of<br>entrenched uh poverty in their household<br>so we're working in some of the poorest<br>communities in the country how we lift<br>them not only in confidence and spirit<br>and modi and waidua but but in basic<br>day-to-day uh capability of get up go to<br>work five days a week six days a week<br>and harvest and then the skills to grow<br>hydroponically work as teams uh all of<br>that and then the connectivity to me is<br>um a bit easier to talk about so i'm<br>just gonna pick a couple of things out<br>that really um are highlights for us and<br>i've come on to this call uh because<br>we're in a shareholder meeting on a<br>teams call at the moment um<br>is our two highlights this year is we<br>are building a maori brand and we've<br>just presented that to our shareholders<br>and they are related at um how it's<br>resonating with particularly our asian<br>consumers but how how it is very much<br>about us as maori and aotearoa new<br>zealand uh and the second thing we're<br>super proud of is we're now 50 hectares<br>um of hydroponic growing and having<br>created uh well over 500 jobs<br>across the network while we've built<br>these orchards so it lands us as a<br>collective now the largest grower of<br>substrate theories in new zealand<br>um and i think i'll just stop there with<br>the<br>middle story and um<br>and hand over to you<br>wayne<br>thanks les yes wayne would you like to<br>comment on our kaupapa<br>uh<br>um<br>so hello everyone my name's wayne um so<br>yeah i guess my experience in terms of<br>just growing and having experience in<br>the modern economy is a little bit<br>different to us so my my<br>journey has been you know the upbringing<br>from down to the grassroots in terms of<br>so of nothing money budget descent so<br>i'm going to take a video to hang a<br>coffee that type of thing is a boy but<br>learning in terms of our you know<br>cultural imperatives our te kang our<br>and then uh you know got the opportunity<br>to study at the waikato management<br>school uh and then i went into the<br>corporate uh setting uh joined<br>pricewaterhousekeepers just over 20<br>years ago so<br>um probably give you some perspectives<br>in terms of working through you know<br>that pathway um quite different very<br>very<br>very kind of uh<br>non-naughty kind of environment if i can<br>express it that way so the challenge for<br>me personally was how do i balance you<br>know my values and my upbringing in a<br>corporate setting um and and<br>it'd be fair to say it's being<br>quite a journey from coming from what's<br>quite a conventional corporate kind of<br>setting to where we are today<br>uh so the group i have today just to<br>give you a sense of the journey that<br>we've had you know there's there's 80 of<br>us across this country in our monaco<br>group<br>uh and we've got uh approximately you<br>know six uh partners with uh maori<br>heritage within the corporate setting um<br>quite a journey from working with uh pre<br>and post settlement groups you know ten<br>years ago when i came back from north<br>shore<br>having workloads on the united kingdom<br>in australia<br>um and seeing the transition in the<br>journey and the impact that's had for<br>obviously for maori and for um<br>ayat in terms of working through that<br>process and the issues and the<br>challenges there but the maori economy's<br>always been at the heart of it<br>it's always been about how do we unlock<br>it um you know lots of literature and<br>stories and and love what liz just<br>shared with you in terms of ambition<br>around you know how we take this how we<br>take this and make it real in terms of<br>productivity in terms of opportunity for<br>maori across the landscape um what's<br>been kind of some of the key<br>definingness for me personally<br>one is around<br>embedding a stronger knowledge of things<br>to almighty<br>um embedding uh tikanga and bidding<br>matapuno our values embedding<br>in organizations like this one and<br>corporate one and be now to use this<br>size and scale to work with maori<br>such as mero such as many organizations<br>eew hot water throughout the country<br>to support them to enable their<br>ambitions commercial<br>social<br>environmental uh or otherwise<br>and so some of the things that we've<br>been focused on as a group uh through<br>our experiences with our people on the<br>ground<br>uh have been you know a number of things<br>one of the things that we did in terms<br>of setting our strategy is we built our<br>railtaki our strategy based on the<br>principles of city or waitangi and so<br>one of the challenges i guess today for<br>both<br>multi-focused entities and non-naughty<br>entities is what does a good treaty<br>partner look like<br>what does that mean<br>and how do you embrace that in terms of<br>the things you want to do with your<br>non-maori or maori and but you're still<br>making a contribution or you are working<br>in the remote economy to get the<br>outcomes that maori seek and obviously<br>you know what that means for ayatura at<br>large so it's a big one the other one is<br>equity just you know what's happening<br>and what do we need to do around some of<br>the challenges that are out there in<br>equity and they're pretty obvious when<br>you think about it in a social<br>perspective from health<br>that we've got in the pandemic at the<br>moment and you know just uh just just<br>looking out at vaccine rates um to you<br>know education to justice to to a range<br>of issues that are real for us as a<br>people in our households and amongst our<br>whanau<br>um so you know technology um you know<br>what do we look like in the digital<br>space got some challenges there you know<br>we we need we need to see what solutions<br>and how we introduce those solutions<br>from a tower maori perspective as we<br>travel in a digital world that's quite<br>real<br>uh maybe one of the other areas um there<br>are significance is just around the<br>whole agribusiness<br>environment maori land owners the use of<br>maori land again reference point in<br>terms of list with metal um and how we<br>get you know outcomes that are going to<br>be relevant for us in terms of the<br>utilization of maori land there are many<br>others what's happening with the water<br>reforms uh for example<br>and um<br>you know just just the kinds of things<br>that are going to be the catalyst for<br>change that is positive for us as maori<br>um the last one probably i'll share is<br>just around wealth management what what<br>do we need to do uh to enter into you<br>know a new chapter uh that's uh that's<br>gonna embed for us in terms of<br>intergenerational perspectives and how<br>do we do that uh with uh with a mindset<br>or wealth management and some of the<br>challenges that are associated with that<br>so i think that's just um that's just<br>the lead in that some of my thinking in<br>terms of you know my experiences within<br>the corporate i'm looking from a<br>different lens i suppose from from this<br>but none the least real and probably the<br>final thing i'll comment on is you know<br>how do we get it right living in a real<br>world where ultimately it's tel pakia<br>and i'm not just talking in terms of<br>this territory but i'm talking globally<br>as well and then from indigenous<br>perspectives so how do we get the<br>balance right in terms of telemari<br>which<br>which is what we live and breathe in<br>terms of our culture and making sure<br>we've got the right balance in terms of<br>the old pacquiao and the tensions that<br>are involved there so i'll leave that<br>shelley as my kind of opening remarks oh<br>cool dwayne thank you so we'll turn to<br>the questions now um there's lots of<br>questions coming through so<br>first of all one for you liz and this<br>will be really drawing on your<br>background um with nzte and mb<br>but to what extent does the maori<br>economy need to be considered separately<br>from the overall economy including for<br>i really have to wrestle my brains back<br>into that mb uh in space<br>um as a separate economy i<br>um<br>i guess at the top level i go to treaty<br>partnership and so i think not joined up<br>but what is a real partnership look like<br>uh it's not a subset it should be a<br>joined up in my view a totally joined up<br>economy where both partners are true<br>partners they understand each other<br>um and uh are respectful of each other<br>and to me that was i always used to<br>think of the phrase of we're growing<br>aotearoa new zealand and that's the the<br>kind of ahu that we took offshore this<br>is where i'll tell new zealand we're a<br>partnership of these two peoples<br>um<br>from a policy perspective uh what would<br>i say if i um<br>reflected on uh previous previous<br>ministers if you focus on the greatest<br>areas of need and the greatest people of<br>need<br>then you don't have to put a badge on it<br>like the mighty economy or the pacifica<br>economy or the anything else economy<br>you're just trying to lift all new<br>zealanders uh up to<br>um a better level a better living<br>standard a better life sort of thing so<br>in some ways i understand that but what<br>i saw across um<br>uh policy in general was that it was<br>very general and it was sort of a one<br>size fits all and so for maori because<br>we do have the worst health stats<br>housing stats uh income stats all of<br>that you can either say<br>the maoris need to get up more we need<br>to catch up to be a partner uh or you<br>can just say really focus our effort and<br>our policies where it's needed and<br>required and that will naturally attract<br>to and attach to maori<br>and also other vulnerable people in the<br>economy whether they are disabled or or<br>what have you<br>thanks liz and our previous speaker new<br>brian from treasury did mention that you<br>know particularly now in covert you know<br>there's these different impacts on<br>different parts of the economy and we<br>can't have a one-size-fits-all so that<br>also reflects what you're saying here<br>and and that you know maori do have a<br>different way of looking at things in<br>the sense of it oftentimes a different<br>purpose it's inter-generational it's<br>underpinned by maori values and<br>sometimes those differences um force<br>businesses such as yourself into making<br>conscious compromises so it's not<br>necessarily<br>a one-size-fits-all economy<br>um so that<br>working those tensions<br>uh wayne a question for you and you<br>might want to comment on the previous<br>one and see the way into this question<br>the maori economy is pretty heavily<br>skewed to the primary sector<br>so do you see this continuing or do you<br>see<br>more of a move into technology<br>i think you've got to realize that you<br>know from a maori perspective the fennel<br>and the ola<br>will always be very significant for us<br>um so when we talk in terms of you know<br>fishing forestry<br>uh farming um<br>we're always going to be uh you know in<br>in that space and will always be<br>significant for us in my view<br>but yeah i mean as as we're moving into<br>you know a world that's quite you know<br>challenging and diverse then you know<br>we've got food we've got fashion we've<br>got fiber and we're starting to see<br>other things kind of come to the fold in<br>terms of you know the opportunities<br>for for maori and that will will<br>agribusiness play a big part going<br>forward i believe so in my view i i<br>think<br>it will i think um there's a significant<br>amount of interest being shown in fino<br>maori from diverse backgrounds<br>um there's a greater appetite for<br>probably land use alternative land uses<br>and that's been driven by sustainability<br>as well<br>but there's a lack of basic and core<br>infrastructure<br>um in my view to to enable you know if<br>you know where development it's getting<br>better but but still there's a long way<br>to go<br>um and then you've got to take into<br>account you know some of the element<br>other elements in terms of the the<br>changes to to to defender act moddy act<br>um<br>and reforms to provide access to capital<br>uh for final and maori as well um i<br>think those things will have an impact<br>as well so my my answers you're still<br>going to see a component of what we<br>understand those traditional sectors<br>particularly in<br>um you know at the agribusiness space<br>but nonetheless you're starting to see<br>an appetite for diversity and going into<br>the areas where we believe are real<br>opportunities for us given you know our<br>background<br>um and that i think we can play<br>significant role in those areas as well<br>great thank you and a question for both<br>of you<br>wayne but we'll start with you and then<br>hand over to you liz how do you and how<br>do we grow more partnerships between<br>maori and non-maori organizations and<br>what advice would you give firms wanting<br>to do business with maori<br>uh from my from my experience in recent<br>years it's quite interesting i think the<br>appetite<br>is a lot a lot higher now than probably<br>would have been a decade ago for sure um<br>i think the greatest challenge there is<br>is you know<br>how do non-maori organizations go about<br>that<br>you know<br>what's their understanding now how do we<br>help<br>them with the understanding around what<br>a good treaty partner looks like<br>and across the corporate environment in<br>recent you know in the last years i've<br>seen a huge change in attitude and<br>appetite for that some big brands really<br>putting their hands up and saying can<br>you help us out we're not quite sure how<br>um and i think they just you know need<br>to actually just take the measures and<br>steps uh that are necessary to um<br>position themselves<br>uh to be treated as you know or to be<br>seen as good treaty partners<br>uh from uh from a uh manifesto<br>perspective i think it's really<br>important that they build those<br>relationships<br>they get them strong or hot<br>or all those<br>focused organizations i think that's<br>really really important to see some<br>success here and i'm probably going to<br>also comment in terms of crown agencies<br>i think that they probably now are<br>starting to have a change in mindset<br>around what that looks like you know in<br>some of those crown agencies mb mpi<br>nzte you're seeing a shift in that<br>attitude as well um but i i think<br>relationships with monophenol are quite<br>key<br>to get the shift that i believe needs to<br>happen<br>thank you wayne liz would you like to<br>comment on<br>you know good partnering and you know<br>advice to businesses wanting to work<br>with maori do i'll take um a slightly<br>different angle and pick up on the last<br>question actually around um how do you<br>partner with maori so if i think about<br>the government and big government<br>agencies in particular it is not about<br>having a mighty policy or sticking a<br>little maori team or person in the<br>corner in your big agency<br>uh any kind of commitment<br>um to partnership or learning more about<br>maori needs to start at the highest<br>level so it starts with your governance<br>and then it starts with your ceo and<br>your leadership team and it filters down<br>through the agency<br>so uh on the government side and the<br>same thing happens on the in the private<br>sector and so i'll mention tejono the<br>primary sector network has been an<br>amazing catalyst for bringing maori and<br>prime mainstream i'll call them primary<br>sector leaders together over a period of<br>eight or nine years bringing ceos<br>bringing directors together taking them<br>away together and what we have seen is<br>that far more connectivity in the<br>primary sector between maori and<br>non-maori you've seen a lot of cross<br>boards happening<br>and that really just comes back to<br>diversity diversity of thought diversity<br>of thinking and so in the primary sector<br>a lot of companies said we actually need<br>to know our people we need to get closer<br>to maori understand what their<br>aspirations are so you saw them taking<br>directors onto their board my own board<br>i have five amazing shareholder<br>directors and we bought on three<br>non-maori uh friends with very high and<br>very specific capability that we need<br>and together we work as a whanau and<br>bring all those perspectives to us and<br>then we sort of dropped down from there<br>so wayne mentioned nzte<br>i was part of that and it was a<br>year-on-year growing with commitment of<br>the top to go from one maori executive<br>to about 40 when i left and the culture<br>of tikanga and<br>maori underpinning and creating the glue<br>of nzte and it was very visible and very<br>relevant and very easy to reach out and<br>touch for the 45 officers around the<br>world who all wanted to tap into that<br>who are we and what do we look like<br>and so yep diversity starts at the top<br>don't stick a little unit in the corner<br>uh you actually have to um have to be it<br>uh and aspire to it and i would say pick<br>up the phone and and figure out who your<br>local ewe uh is the best place to start<br>and go and have a cup of tea with them<br>great thank you both very much we do<br>have other questions here and i<br>apologize we didn't get to them there<br>was a final um question which i really<br>liked because it was very much about<br>that matakita<br>futurist vision of a future and would we<br>even have a term like the maori economy<br>and you know i like to think that we<br>will have a well-being economy based on<br>the principles of<br>kaitiakitanga a sustainable world in a<br>world where we're all well including our<br>environment and i really appreciate now<br>the rich insight that you have both<br>brought to our session it's insight<br>based on grounded practical experience<br>thank you both for sharing your<br>knowledge in in service of a better more<br>sustainable world and i really want to<br>thank our audience for the great<br>questions and for engaging and also to<br>the organizers and the tech support so<br>and wayne a fantastic session strikes me<br>listening to some of our sessions during<br>the day today<br>we are facing a challenging world and it<br>was<br>lovely to hear the discussion there and<br>i think one of the greatest areas of<br>opportunity is of course<br>the growth of maori economy whether we<br>use that term off into the future as<br>you've just said shall we or not<br>so thank you for the discussion just now<br>all right on with our next topic we are<br>going to move into a session on<br>education of course<br>any of us i know as a parent education<br>of the kids in my house has been pretty<br>disrupted over the last couple of years<br>many people are going through changes<br>and challenges it's always a fascinating<br>topic here at a university<br>anyway i'm going to hand over to the<br>moderator for this session professor eva<br>collins another member of the waikato<br>management school team eva we're in your<br>hands<br>thanks matt<br>uh tennokoto katoa as matt said this<br>forum is being hosted by an educational<br>institution so you can imagine the<br>interest in what this next panel has to<br>say<br>keeping to the now familiar format<br>after introducing the panel and giving<br>them a chance to make some opening<br>comments we'll take questions from slido<br>and also we're letting in encouraging<br>the panelists to ask each other<br>questions<br>we have until 2 30 to explore<br>educational issues in covid<br>so on to our panel our panel includes<br>alex fernandez de alevera chief<br>investment officer at the international<br>finance corporation<br>professor don klinger pro vice<br>chancellor division of education<br>university of wakato<br>dr michael johnston<br>senior fellow at the new zealand<br>initiative and senior lecturer in<br>education at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>so over to you alex to get us started<br>thank you eva and first of all thank you<br>very much for for the opportunity and<br>the invitation it's my first time<br>attending the forum a little<br>disappointed that we're not uh in person<br>in hamilton but but hopefully um for the<br>next one<br>i thought i'd use these initial minutes<br>to talk a little bit about ifc i<br>realized that many people in attendance<br>might not be familiar with whom we are<br>and what we do<br>talk a little bit about<br>my role at ifc<br>and then sort of leave<br>a high level message<br>that is hopefully useful in<br>in starting the the panel discussion<br>so ifc is the private sector arm of the<br>world bank group<br>we share the same development objectives<br>as the world bank itself<br>but we work exclusively with private<br>sector so all of the investments we make<br>all of the projects we engage with are<br>driven by private sector no<br>government<br>interference<br>we are active across a whole range of of<br>industries<br>our last fiscal year we did about 30<br>billion<br>dollars worth of investments<br>and we<br>do<br>sort of a full range of of<br>financial<br>investments from senior loans to<br>straight equity<br>and i think the other feature is or two<br>important features<br>one is we only work in emerging markets<br>so we work with companies from all over<br>the world but the projects they are<br>investing in have to be uh in emerging<br>markets and<br>the second angle you know<br>uh<br>we are a development institution so<br>way before sort of the the concept of<br>impact investing<br>was was developed<br>we had already been doing it so all of<br>our investments we have to justify the<br>financial return<br>but also some measure of broader good<br>uh to the economy to to<br>a society a particular country<br>that's that's sort of part of our role<br>i lead our<br>health and education investments across<br>asia<br>the theme that binds health and<br>education together is for us development<br>of human capital our view is countries<br>cannot develop unless they're able to<br>accumulate<br>human capital and health and education<br>are both<br>critical pillars<br>in<br>stimulating<br>helping countries i guess develop<br>human capital<br>we do<br>in education which is this afternoon's<br>topic we have today a portfolio of about<br>a billion dollars<br>most of it out to higher education<br>institutions that's been<br>uh typically our focus more than primary<br>and secondary education although we have<br>invested in in primary and secondary<br>education<br>schools<br>a<br>fairly well<br>diversified portfolio<br>significant in latin america significant<br>in asia uh but also<br>middle east in in africa so a fairly<br>balanced geographically very balanced uh<br>education portfolio<br>and i think the the<br>the<br>key<br>uh sort of<br>uh message um<br>as i mentioned we we work with with<br>private sector<br>and in emerging markets what we have<br>seen i think our experience has been<br>that the private sector actually<br>contributes quite a bit<br>to strengthening local um education<br>systems at one level it's just a sheer<br>you know additional<br>resources uh<br>fiscal situation<br>in many of the countries we work in is<br>challenging colvit has not helped<br>and private sector uh<br>you know brings<br>additional resources which uh tend to to<br>strengthen education systems in in these<br>countries<br>i think the the the other angle<br>um<br>is<br>i i would say if i had to summarize our<br>strategy for<br>uh investing in education in private<br>education in emerging markets<br>we're trying to support institutions<br>that<br>provide relevant education and typically<br>help<br>uh<br>young people<br>obtain relevant jobs i think that is<br>at the core<br>what we see as sort of our strategy what<br>we see as as our objective help<br>especially young people develop the<br>skills that are relevant in the job<br>market and as a result<br>obtain relevant employment<br>and i think in our in our experience<br>private sector plays an important role<br>uh<br>establishing i would say better links to<br>labor markets<br>tailoring education<br>that is more relevant<br>i would say helps this transition<br>from sort of from school<br>to to the workplace<br>we don't see it as<br>one or the other it's not public versus<br>private our experience has been i would<br>say that private sector complements uh<br>uh very well in in many of the countries<br>we work in sort of uh public sector<br>efforts in<br>in promoting education<br>that was a lot um i hope it was clear<br>but i'll stop here in terms of opening<br>remarks and<br>pass it over to<br>to the panel<br>thank you alex that was very clear and<br>and helpful to hear about ifc's role and<br>in your discussion about the<br>opportunity for private uh sector<br>investment and education<br>let's now turn it over to don for his<br>and as evan mentioned i am the professor<br>i'm professor don klinger i'm the pvc<br>for tewananga toy tanganya division of<br>education at the university of hokkaido<br>um<br>you may have also quickly surmised that<br>my own story did not begin in in new<br>zealand i prior to coming to the<br>university of waikato i was in canada<br>with experience as an as an educator and<br>an academic researcher in the field of<br>educational measurement<br>i've long been interested in the uses<br>and misuses of large-scale testing<br>and and also the factors that impact<br>student success<br>and i've looked at you know whatever<br>however we defined uh success i mean i<br>think there's lots of ways we can talk<br>about what success really looks like<br>um i think what you'll see from the<br>panelists i mean there's a lot we agree<br>on and you know i've actually done some<br>work with yaga khan foundation which is<br>also a private organization that funds<br>educational initiatives so we've worked<br>as a panel to try to really highlight<br>where we're coming at this from<br>different perspectives<br>so with that<br>what i'm going to talk about here<br>is<br>my central argument is that the<br>challenges of covid<br>and what what its impact has been on<br>education um is<br>the solution to it has to be in the ways<br>we support and help public education<br>i don't think the solutions are going to<br>be in the private sector the same way<br>that the other panelists are going to<br>talk about<br>um<br>now you know before you dismiss me as<br>one this just another one of those<br>left-wing socialists that has no<br>understanding of finances or economics<br>uh please know i've long argued that<br>education does have to be more like a<br>business<br>too often educators talk about you know<br>they're different than they don't have<br>to worry about finances i've never<br>bought into that argument<br>we are a resource intense industry and<br>therefore we have responsibility to<br>really think about our how we use those<br>you know i have<br>a background in finance and business<br>i also worked in a school system<br>where we had school-based<br>decision-making and so i saw when edge<br>schools can become what i call resource<br>pits and we just can't have that<br>so as i said i've always had the<br>position i used to get in big debates<br>with colleagues around this whole<br>position around you know our schools a<br>business um<br>you know i would argue they're not a<br>business but that be business-like as<br>i've just said<br>um<br>where i do struggle with some of the<br>economic philosophies in education is<br>when it's centered around the notion of<br>competitive structure rather than of<br>what i would call a fundamental social<br>responsibility framework<br>and i think this is where i'm going to<br>push some of my my work<br>and i'll talk about this from the work i<br>do on statistical modeling and education<br>and over the past several years i've<br>really looked at<br>you know models of educational outcomes<br>uh what predicts them<br>what are the things that seem to impact<br>student achievement or student outcomes<br>whether it be health and well-being<br>physical education<br>you know belongingness all sorts of<br>issues success outcomes like that<br>and<br>what i've what i've been telling people<br>and i've said this a lot if you want to<br>see the best education system in the<br>world go to the usa<br>just look to the u.s<br>uh there's a reason the u.s has got more<br>nobel prize winners than the next six<br>at the same time i've also said if you<br>want to see the worst education in the<br>world<br>go to the us<br>the u.s is a really strong model it's a<br>competitive model where you have massive<br>educational equities and so the work i<br>do is called hlm hardcore linear<br>modeling and if you can see what we<br>typically see is the us has a growth<br>curve like this the top performing<br>schools are right up top<br>and the lower performing schools are<br>quite low there's a big difference<br>in the us the school you go to<br>the schools that you go to really matter<br>on your educational outcomes<br>now in contrast to that we look at<br>countries such as finland and canada and<br>they've been they have very high<br>educational standards they do extremely<br>well on pisa<br>assessment and in the other kind of<br>assessments that are out there but you<br>also find much greater equity<br>so if i show the graph like the us is<br>there the graph for canada is basically<br>like that<br>now what you will see<br>is that in canada<br>the peak is typically not as high we<br>just don't have the same high high<br>top-end schools that the us has we have<br>one or two<br>but what we don't have are big<br>differences at the bottom in fact in<br>canada and the same in finland the<br>school you go to doesn't really matter<br>you'll get a high quality education in<br>now there are issues that we talked<br>about in canada about raising that bars<br>that you get everything higher<br>and the reason i talked about this is<br>the second reason both canada and<br>finland do not have a large private<br>school system they're very much a public<br>system<br>now statistically alter new zealand<br>looks more like the us than either<br>now i'm painting a i won't say an<br>artificial picture but i'm highlighting<br>some big differences but i have to be<br>open and honest here even in canada and<br>regardless of the educational outcomes<br>we measure there's a large proportion of<br>students we're not meeting the standards<br>we want for children<br>they feel they don't belong<br>their academic achievement is below uh<br>they're connecting it to school<br>uh is missing so we get between about 15<br>and 30 percent of our children just<br>don't feel connected to schools or don't<br>succeed<br>it's like it's less in canada but it's<br>still there<br>now it's these eq in equities<br>sorry these inequities are not random<br>they're systematic they're systemic we<br>see them across certain population<br>groups in certain communities in regions<br>uh you can imagine some of them already<br>you know if you think about about new<br>zealand itself<br>and<br>i think it's not hard to argue that<br>covid and its long tail will really<br>likely exacerbate these existing<br>inequities<br>there's a long list of factors that<br>contribute to these inequities under<br>covid<br>teacher readiness and their their own<br>skills in dealing with online learning<br>home learning resources that children<br>have access to whether it be books<br>computers<br>ipads<br>chromebooks<br>broadband internet<br>dedicated learning spaces<br>either in the community or in the home<br>uh family and community supports<br>i mean many of us here were well versed<br>in how to support our children under a<br>number of different challenging<br>circumstances that's not equally<br>distributed across our populations<br>and these are all critical factors but<br>also they're ones that are largely are<br>the control of the students themselves<br>it's not their fault<br>and yet they're the ones that have to<br>struggle with the<br>implications of these inequities<br>so what i'm arguing is we have to<br>differentially distribute resources to<br>our schools in order to address these<br>inequities<br>especially as a result of coving<br>and this is where the competitive<br>education models are really challenging<br>these models tend to<br>reward prior success<br>and it's a classic case of the rich get<br>richer<br>not a bad model for businesses perhaps<br>but it's not really a strong model in<br>education<br>what we actually need to do is to direct<br>the resources and research supported<br>professional learning as well to those<br>educators to those educators in the<br>public system who are best situated to<br>address these inequities<br>where are the problems how do we get<br>support into those schools into those<br>communities<br>we already have evidence that this kind<br>of model works<br>uh the province of ontario in canada did<br>use something called the ofip project it<br>was called the ontario focus<br>intervention<br>and what they did is identified the<br>lowest performing schools and they<br>directed<br>research-based professional learning to<br>their teaching staff<br>and other resources community to support<br>the performance of students in this case<br>in literacy and numeracy on critical<br>outcomes in those areas<br>and as a result what they found was that<br>those schools that and it wasn't<br>universal by any means this is not a<br>simple solution but what they did find<br>that in many of those schools they were<br>able to move themselves well out of that<br>bottom<br>what they call quartile range into the<br>you know they still weren't above<br>average but they were moving up towards<br>average performing schools<br>and i think this is the same kind of<br>structure we have to think about as we<br>deal with a coveted tail<br>we've got 15 to 30 percent of our<br>students that are really going to<br>struggle and these are the ones are<br>going to have the the biggest challenges<br>uh catching up<br>and meeting the standards we need for<br>so there's<br>thank you don um and what i like about a<br>panel and particularly an afternoon<br>panel<br>is one that um represents a broad range<br>of perspectives on the important issues<br>so don i appreciate<br>uh your<br>the view that was quite different from<br>what alex just presented<br>our final speaker in the panel is<br>michael so over to you michael for your<br>comments<br>thank you very much oprah<br>i'm really going to i think build<br>largely on what don has said and on the<br>issue with public sector and private<br>sector involvement in education i<br>probably sit somewhere between the first<br>two speakers i i certainly take on board<br>don's point about the<br>risks of<br>a system which has<br>a private sector within the public<br>domain<br>exacerbating<br>educational inequality i saw it in<br>action when i was<br>at the university of melbourne lecturing<br>there<br>nearly 20 years ago<br>most of the students who got into that<br>university were private school educated<br>and<br>the<br>certainly the private sector is much<br>more involved in education there<br>than it is in new zealand and in general<br>i would like to see<br>a public school system that is well<br>funded and that does a good job of<br>teaching children what they need to<br>thrive in the world i think it's<br>if it's working well it's a very good<br>way of overcoming<br>intergenerational poverty<br>however<br>there is the crux of it is is it working<br>well uh is it delivering those outcomes<br>and at the moment there's a great deal<br>of evidence in new zealand that our<br>system is not as don said we resembled<br>the american system in some ways and and<br>that is<br>a very large gap between<br>the the students who are doing the best<br>and the students are doing the poorest<br>we have some large<br>socio-economic and ethnic gaps in our<br>educational data and this is something<br>that ought to concern us<br>um<br>and as don also said you know<br>this inequity has it has its<br>sources beyond the control of the<br>students themselves but also in fact<br>beyond direct control of schools a lot<br>of the time the socioeconomic factors<br>that play into things and as don also<br>said i think that it's almost inevitable<br>that the covert lockdowns will have<br>exacerbated educational inequality for<br>almost obvious reasons despite the fact<br>that we haven't seen any hard data on it<br>yet i think that's going to turn out to<br>be so<br>so<br>what can we do about it<br>well one thing you know<br>that we need to be aware of and where i<br>think<br>the private sector<br>may keep the public sector honest to it<br>to an extent<br>is in the provision of high quality<br>teaching and learning<br>so if the public's school system can<br>provide<br>teaching and learning of equal quality<br>to what you can get in a private school<br>why would anybody spend 25 000 a year to<br>use a private school<br>or maybe for snob reasons but not not<br>many people you know have so much money<br>they can afford to to spend it on that<br>so if we can<br>uh<br>equip the public school system<br>with what it needs to to do<br>as well as those private schools then<br>there shouldn't be an issue um and to<br>that that extent i think it's good that<br>there are private schools there as an<br>element of competition if you will so<br>that we can measure something against<br>uh what the public schools are capable<br>of<br>so there are some problems<br>in in the system and they're not all<br>related to money that's the thing it's<br>we could spend a huge amount of money on<br>the public school system and have better<br>teacher student ratios and better<br>resources and you know these wouldn't be<br>a bad thing but however there's some<br>things that we can do that are not going<br>to cost all that much in comparison<br>uh that could improve things markedly<br>and a lot of that has to do with just<br>following evidence<br>so<br>i think for one thing um we need to look<br>at what is taught in schools<br>so<br>i'm quite a fan of the critical realist<br>educational school of thought which uh<br>perhaps the biggest thinker in the world<br>was michael fd young he's a british<br>educational philosopher and sociologist<br>and<br>he had an insight that really what we<br>need to do<br>inequality that affects education is to<br>make sure that<br>all students but especially those from<br>disadvantaged<br>communities have access to powerful<br>knowledge<br>and powerful knowledge he he said are<br>things like mathematics and science and<br>literacy and<br>as well you know things like english and<br>history<br>so the disciplines of our cultures that<br>ground us you know in<br>where we've come from and also<br>in<br>what we need to do to test ideas<br>so things like science for example<br>obviously is about testing ideas using<br>evidence<br>and<br>these are the things that i think we<br>need to emphasize as coherent bodies of<br>knowledge<br>and we can get into perhaps in question<br>time where some of that is is lacking<br>um but the other thing that we need to<br>focus on is the pedagogy of teaching<br>itself and make sure that we're doing it<br>in the most effective possible way<br>and at the moment we're just not<br>there is<br>at least two decades maybe three decades<br>for which we've been teaching literacy<br>in a way that<br>really doesn't work optimally well<br>in spite of having an enormous amount of<br>evidence from cognitive psychology and<br>related disciplines about how to teach<br>reading effectively<br>and that creates these<br>these socioeconomic gaps in in learners<br>because those who have home resources<br>will still do all right but those who<br>really need<br>the sound science of learning behind the<br>pedagogy they experience in schools will<br>often struggle<br>so<br>that may be a a good place to conclude<br>my opening remarks and we can we can<br>start to have some discussion<br>thank you michael i appreciate that<br>um so<br>each of you touched on this topic and<br>looking through the slido questions it's<br>the one that<br>comes up most of all and i encourage<br>participants to keep keep those<br>questions coming through<br>the the worry that i'm seeing through<br>the questions and is about the um<br>exacerbation of inequalities<br>um through covid especially for our most<br>vulnerable so michael you said something<br>a little controversial there about uh it<br>does it takes more than money<br>but i'd like to just unpack this a<br>little bit more from each of you about<br>what how how are we going to address<br>shall i<br>yeah so i mean it will take some money<br>it takes money to do just about anything<br>of course<br>but i don't think it takes the sort of<br>massive resources that parents put into<br>private schools say when they when they<br>you know buy a place for their child in<br>a private school<br>it takes a ministry of education that<br>will use<br>an evidence-based approach to uh advice<br>to teachers it takes<br>faculties of education who will train<br>teachers according to that advice<br>and and according to the evidence<br>and<br>that actually you know doesn't cost very<br>much at all it's just a change of tack<br>in terms of how we approach<br>what what actually happens in schools<br>when we teach things like literacy and<br>numeracy<br>so that's why i say that it needn't be<br>we could get a lot of bang for it for<br>not that many bucks for it that way<br>alex or don would you like to come in on<br>this<br>yeah i mean i think uh for me<br>i mean i agree it's not purely a money<br>situation<br>in terms of throwing cash at the system<br>especially depends on the nature the<br>problem is if it's still a problem of<br>uh students living or trying to learn<br>online i think that needs money we've<br>got to get systems to them broadband and<br>that that's an infrastructure issue<br>i think if we've got students that need<br>to be schools catching up what we<br>actually need is exactly what michael's<br>talking about and that's an influx of<br>really<br>strong professional development for our<br>teachers that they can use while working<br>with students so it can't be a one-off<br>type of professional learning it's got<br>to be something that's going to last for<br>the next two years to help work with<br>their students<br>um<br>you know<br>covert has been impacting us for now for<br>for two and a half years<br>well two years now it's going to be it's<br>going to be for longer it's going to<br>take that long to fix it as well so i<br>think we've got to play the long game<br>and that is work with schools<br>that have seen these real inequities<br>surface<br>and then get some good science teaching<br>science behind them and working with<br>those teachers to implement those kinds<br>of structures to help their students<br>succeed um<br>you know we talk about resilience i<br>don't like that term<br>but<br>you know students are able children are<br>able to learn and they can learn<br>effectively with good teaching so i<br>think it's really about solving that<br>problem making sure they get the best<br>teaching possible in those in the<br>situation and it might look different<br>than what they're used to<br>probably in fact it will<br>okay<br>i'll come in<br>i guess from a slightly different angle<br>but the first<br>um<br>you know not wanting people to walk away<br>with the sense that you know ifc were<br>unscrupulous uh<br>you know capitalists uh<br>not at all i think this issue of equity<br>and education is is front and center um<br>in in our thinking<br>um<br>in all of our investments uh without<br>without exception uh they are<br>relatively speaking<br>accessible perhaps not to the very very<br>base of the pyramid to the extent that<br>we uh the companies we support charge<br>tuition uh but don't think of the<br>institutions we support is sort of<br>accessible<br>only to the elite of a particular<br>country<br>it's<br>we<br>strive and help these companies actually<br>uh reach<br>as far as they can uh down down down the<br>pyramid<br>um<br>look<br>i think<br>i think we're all still<br>learning about this i<br>a little bit of the evidence that i've<br>seen uh<br>studies done by the world uh bank itself<br>i think the impact is significant the<br>past couple of years have not been kind<br>uh to<br>primary and secondary students all over<br>the world in my sense it<br>makes and that makes sense the less<br>resources a particular system had the<br>worst their kids have been hit<br>and i don't know i mean<br>dawn and michael<br>are<br>uh the education experts i i come at<br>this from a different uh point but<br>in in my mind<br>you can't make up for lost time without<br>investing more time so there's no magic<br>bullet that you can get these kids<br>and just you know do something<br>and recoup the past couple of years<br>unless they stay you know twice as long<br>in school<br>which then for a number of other reasons<br>is unlikely to happen uh one thing one<br>area<br>and we might not uh be in full agreement<br>technology can help<br>i think<br>short sometimes of being able to afford<br>a private education what we have seen in<br>many of the countries we operate in<br>is sort of<br>a<br>remedial<br>services tutoring services<br>that leverage technology and make that<br>available um<br>to<br>to kids at scale it's not an ideal<br>solution by any uh stretch of the<br>imagination but to the extent that<br>um you know your kids are more or less<br>forced to attend an underperforming<br>system<br>and you're short of alternatives this is<br>better than nothing<br>and i i say this with with<br>caveats and reservation<br>but i think the gap that's been created<br>these past couple of years will not<br>magically disapprove<br>and i think the only way to address this<br>is remedial uh services and there i<br>think technology has has a role to play<br>that's a that's a good segue because the<br>probably the second most common theme in<br>the questions on slido is about<br>technology and specifically about online<br>learning<br>with one questioner uh controversially<br>suggesting that with the disruptions<br>maybe we should just go completely<br>online um so<br>uh maybe not going that far but it'd be<br>interesting to hear<br>michael and dawn cause alex has just<br>talked about this about what your views<br>about technology is specifically online<br>learning and what's the role there<br>yeah of course sorry you go down<br>go ahead i i think it's an interesting<br>one i'm i don't think online learning is<br>a solution to all of our problems<br>i think it's it's a good technical<br>resource i think it has some real value<br>you know i i think<br>you know let's talk about industry and<br>and what what our industries need and<br>what our commercial enterprises need and<br>i don't think we want a world where<br>everybody's working online either<br>there's a real skill set i mean when we<br>look at graduate profiles what what<br>industries and and businesses want from<br>their our graduates<br>it's communication skills it's ability<br>to work in groups and teams<br>i think online learning really struggles<br>to create those kind of atmospheres to<br>do that again especially for some groups<br>of students<br>so i think we have to be careful on that<br>um<br>you know one thing that<br>will be important<br>is you know as as i said it's going to<br>take time to fix it there's going to be<br>a requirement for<br>tertiary education and businesses to<br>provide some of the opportunities for<br>learning also now how to work in these<br>different kinds of environments as well<br>so you know technology on its own won't<br>solve it unless we have really good<br>systems in place to help people<br>integrate that into the everyday<br>workplace and learning in higher ed<br>yeah i agree with that i mean i think we<br>have to distinguish between technology<br>in general and you know kids learning on<br>zoom or something i think<br>you know zoom<br>it's been a necessary evil i mean look<br>at us we're here today on so we probably<br>couldn't have this conference without it<br>so it's certainly better than nothing<br>but i think it's one of the main reasons<br>why<br>we will see an exacerbation of<br>inequality um as a result of cohort and<br>i i do not want to see my children or<br>other children<br>learning on zoom or in these kinds of<br>environments<br>schools are social places and that we<br>must never forget the huge importance of<br>social learning i feel immensely sorry<br>for both the primary and secondary<br>students are at different stages of<br>their social learning and i've had that<br>badly disrupted<br>and and i agree with alex that we will<br>not see<br>the<br>the legacy of this disappear quickly uh<br>unfortunately it's going to be with us<br>for a while uh the worst thing we could<br>do is carry on as if you know this was a<br>good thing because<br>while some people you know i think it<br>goes to actually to the whole experience<br>of lockdown itself there are people here<br>in wellington who have secured jobs in<br>academia and the public service sitting<br>at home in their nice houses<br>working away quite comfortably there are<br>others in crowded accommodation<br>losing their jobs losing their<br>livelihoods losing their minds and that<br>there's no way to live and there's no<br>way to learn<br>so but yes technology can<br>certainly help us i mean literacy as a<br>technology has been with us for<br>thousands of years and a massively<br>important one for education so of course<br>we should be looking at new technology<br>and what it can offer us um but not at<br>the expense of being together as people<br>and the the<br>relationship that is uh<br>absolutely at the heart of teaching and<br>learning<br>so<br>i i don't want to see us perpetuate<br>anything that comes from the covert euro<br>honestly to see us try to put it behind<br>us and as alex said it will take a while<br>i do think that if we<br>focus hard on<br>some of the things that we haven't been<br>doing as well as we might<br>like<br>you know effective teaching based on the<br>science of learning<br>we started to really put that into place<br>with with gusto and enthusiasm then we<br>could catch up somewhat because<br>tragically for some time we have not<br>been<br>as effective as we could be by any means<br>in some of the basics of education so<br>we could accelerate things if we started<br>to do that<br>yeah agreed<br>thank you michael and you touched on um<br>the the social fabric and the importance<br>of the social fabric and i want to<br>switch gears a little bit uh and and<br>cover another important aspect of<br>education that's come through on the<br>slido and that's about the query is what<br>insights does the panel have<br>on teachers mental health and workload<br>issues and is there a crisis around<br>losing teachers which relates to the<br>immigration panel from the economics<br>forum<br>and then importantly what are the<br>solutions so so going um to the staffing<br>alex do you want to start<br>don go ahead go ahead<br>uh certainly<br>new zealand with its mandates has<br>certainly had a<br>sudden loss of the teaching force<br>um due to the current mandates<br>um<br>i mean it's an interesting profession i<br>think people that go into teaching uh<br>learn or the ones that survive learn<br>early on it's a stressful position a<br>profession that takes a lot of time and<br>effort<br>uh<br>so<br>you know i think they're ready for that<br>and they've done well<br>where the real struggles have come is<br>certainly been let's see<br>the uncertainty that comes across as as<br>many of us have experienced and having<br>to then teach also both in online and in<br>person environments<br>i think that's challenging any of us<br>have tried it they've really found that<br>as well<br>and i think it just that extra<br>additional time that teachers are facing<br>um there's another hidden one that's out<br>there and you see this again we're a<br>caring profession<br>you know to our strength and to our<br>weakness at times<br>there's many again the research isn't<br>great on this but there's lots of<br>anecdotal evidence of teachers spending<br>time in the evenings with their students<br>and trying to support them and families<br>in crisis as well so they're giving up<br>their own health and well-being for<br>their families to support other families<br>in crisis<br>so i think this is where the the<br>unknowns are certainly are there and we<br>have to really watch for that<br>i think principals are doing a good job<br>monitoring it but many of us don't say<br>i have a phd student who's um<br>commencing a<br>project on<br>burnout and teachers um and<br>you know she's been in schools for a<br>while she she teaches yoga actually as<br>one of her<br>things and<br>um<br>so she's coming at it from a perspective<br>of what can be done to mitigate<br>as don says what is intrinsically quite<br>a stressful<br>uh profession<br>uh i do think that there's been<br>an issue for a long time<br>which has again been exacerbated by the<br>coveted situation<br>the amount of pressure that the teachers<br>work with and and while i think<br>there is inevitably<br>because you're dealing with young people<br>you're dealing inevitably there are<br>social problems that come into your life<br>that<br>your students are having um because of<br>things that are happening<br>in their households or in their<br>communities but<br>those issues<br>are hard to deal with<br>by their nature i'm not sure that we do<br>enough to support teachers in what<br>they're expected to do i think schools<br>are now you know becoming more and more<br>almost social work centers as well as<br>educational centers to an extent perhaps<br>they always have been but you know we're<br>seeing schools feeding children who<br>don't have breakfast these kinds of<br>things and you know these are good<br>things to do but<br>we have to recognize the amount of<br>pressure that that puts on<br>uh education workers<br>and the extent to which<br>burnout is a danger and then we do lose<br>people from the system and that that's<br>terrible because you lose experienced<br>people and it's cerebral for them<br>because first of all they lose<br>their profession because they can't cope<br>with it anymore and also they've got a<br>legacy of<br>anxiety and depression to deal with so<br>i don't know what the answers are to<br>this um but it's something that a<br>problem that we need to recognize and<br>try to grapple with<br>thank you michael um alex we have just a<br>few minutes left and i'm keen to hear<br>your views on this topic so so in a very<br>very briefly um<br>look and this is more anecdotal from the<br>experience of some of the education<br>institutions that we've invested in<br>um so<br>we monitor and talk to them often right<br>and remember that we work in emerging<br>markets<br>so countries with much more challenging<br>uh environments than new zealand or<br>or the us europe<br>etc and i think that in these countries<br>where there's virtually no safety nets<br>uh unfortunately what we saw are schools<br>closing because<br>you know if if the teacher him or<br>herself or somebody in the family is ill<br>or<br>there's just no alternative<br>and so he or she cannot show up<br>uh<br>that happens to a few people the schools<br>are closed and we have seen<br>so again anecdotal but<br>evidence but schools in india shut down<br>for months on end<br>um and that's as i said that there's no<br>you know there's not<br>and connectivity is an issue so as bad<br>as the zoom class<br>that my kids<br>had to sit through that's not available<br>it's a real loss<br>i i think it is a huge issue<br>in general it is not uh unfortunately a<br>profession that is<br>uh uh better remunerated uh across the<br>world certainly in emerging markets<br>um and in countries with no with very<br>little safety net uh<br>not not in a bad way but the students<br>pay the price because the school<br>yeah i just want to agree with what alex<br>is saying as well i mean i<br>i have worked in pakistan and in<br>tanzania and<br>certainly in those areas<br>you know the challenges are so much<br>greater uh for all those reasons so it's<br>all the problems we're talking about are<br>even bigger there<br>and so we we end this conversation on<br>the the inequities that that we started<br>with with covid um and we've covered a<br>lot of ground i really appreciate and<br>want to thank our panelists for their<br>input and and<br>has given us lots to to think about so<br>thank you very much<br>and thank you to michael to alex and to<br>don for that panel<br>when we look at the wider theme uh<br>dealing with covid's long tail but also<br>that that range of issues that we're<br>facing<br>of course the people that are going<br>through some of these education uh<br>systems and therefore the challenges<br>that you've just described<br>uh also the people who are inheriting<br>the the challenging world that we're<br>grappling with now so it's an absolutely<br>critical topic<br>we are going to go to a break we'll have<br>a 15-minute break now we'll be back at 2<br>45<br>next two sessions we have the first on<br>economic disparity uh be very<br>interesting session there and then on to<br>labor productivity and migration<br>settings very topical and last we'll<br>have the the wrap with former prime<br>minister jim bulger joining us at the<br>end of the day look forward to seeing<br>you in 15 minutes<br>so<br>good<br>so<br>do<br>so<br>do<br>um<br>do<br>kia ora welcome back to the 2022 new<br>zealand economics forum<br>we're going now into a session that i've<br>been particularly looking forward to<br>we're going to be getting views on<br>economic disparity it's been a theme<br>that's run through many of the<br>discussions today<br>and one that i think the wider society<br>is grappling with we've got a couple of<br>fantastic panelists here who are going<br>to be bringing different takes on this<br>and then hopefully we'll have some<br>lively debate i'm sure so i will hand<br>over to my colleague professor anna<br>strut<br>also from the waikato management school<br>and looking forward to this discussion<br>in your hands anna<br>thank you very much matt and i've been<br>particularly looking forward to this<br>this session too uh neil started right<br>out in his intro comments talking about<br>the importance of inequality helen clark<br>mentioned that covert has globally<br>increased inequality and new zealand is<br>no exception that certainly came through<br>in the last session on education<br>so you know i'm really looking forward<br>to the insights that our panelists today<br>will bring our two distinguished<br>panelists that we have with us today we<br>have professor jonathan boston from<br>the school of government at victoria<br>university of wellington<br>and we have matt burgess from the new<br>zealand initiative<br>very very much looking forward to the<br>insights that each of the panelists are<br>going to bring but i'm also looking<br>forward to the probing questions that<br>the audience will bring that will really<br>draw on the expertise of our panelists<br>so keep those slido questions rolling in<br>and with that i'd like to pass straight<br>over to you jonathan thanks<br>well thank you anna uh<br>katoa everyone thank you for this<br>opportunity to contribute<br>to this forum<br>currently new zealand has significant<br>disparities in income and wealth<br>these include both intra and<br>intergenerational disparities along with<br>ethnic<br>gender and geographic disparities<br>our attitude to these disparities is<br>inevitably<br>shaped<br>by our philosophical ideological and<br>religious convictions<br>there is no moral<br>neutrality in this space<br>the territory is inherently<br>value-laden<br>and deeply contested<br>people disagree about both the ends<br>and the means and of course there's much<br>complexity<br>for multiple ethical reasons i believe<br>that a just or fair society requires a<br>broadly egalitarian approach<br>and this entails at least four things<br>first a strong commitment to the equal<br>value worth and dignity of every person<br>supported by a comprehensive set of<br>equal citizenship rights<br>second a requirement to satisfy every<br>person's basic needs which in turn means<br>minimizing income-based poverty and<br>material hardship so<br>a commitment to intergenerational<br>justice which includes protecting<br>ecological integrity and sustainability<br>and fourth support for the principle of<br>fair equality of opportunity applied<br>broadly but also to specific goods and<br>services like education which was the<br>subject of a previous discussion<br>our current relatively high rates of<br>income and wealth inequality<br>with gini coefficients in this country<br>for both well above 30 percent<br>are not consistent in my view with these<br>principles of justice<br>moreover there is reliable international<br>evidence that higher rates of income and<br>wealth inequality<br>tend other things being equal<br>to reduce social cohesion and trust<br>increase corruption<br>weaken democratic institutions and<br>exacerbate ecological degradation<br>there was a good case in my view for<br>reducing income and wealth inequality in<br>new zealand well before the covert 19<br>pandemic<br>but the pandemic has almost certainly<br>increased wealth inequality and worsened<br>intergenerational inequality<br>given the massive increase in house<br>prices<br>the current ecological crises climate<br>biodiversity loss and so on will<br>ultimately<br>impose vast additional costs on future<br>generations<br>unjustly<br>the pandemic has not however worsened<br>poverty<br>stats new zealand released their latest<br>poverty data this morning for the year<br>ended june 2021<br>and in brief across the three key<br>primary poverty measures<br>child poverty rates which essentially<br>measure family poverty<br>these rates remained broadly stable<br>over recent years or declined slightly<br>as a result two of the three<br>intermediate targets<br>that the government set for child<br>poverty reduction<br>have been met<br>nevertheless significant rates of<br>poverty remain<br>and there has been little change to the<br>rates of severe material hardship over<br>recent years which is particularly<br>concerning<br>i had expected material hardship rates<br>to increase in the year to june 2021<br>because of the pandemic but it did not<br>perhaps for two reasons<br>first<br>the government's multiple covert<br>response measures appear to have been<br>relatively successful<br>for example median household disposable<br>incomes were up around 4.5 percent in<br>the year to june 2021<br>second stats new zealand doesn't<br>interview destitute people<br>or those in emergency housing<br>and it is quite likely that the covet<br>pandemic increased the number of such<br>people<br>for those who accept the case for lower<br>rates of income<br>and wealth inequality including less<br>poverty<br>the fundamental question is how to do so<br>in the most cost effective and<br>sustainable manner<br>and there's no simple answer<br>unfortunately there is a powerful<br>political asymmetry at work<br>it is much easier politically to<br>increase inequality than to reduce it<br>also in a globalized world there are<br>constraints on what individual nations<br>can do<br>broadly speaking the key to reducing<br>economic inequality is enhancing the<br>redistributive impact<br>of the tax and welfare system or the<br>transfer system<br>on the tax side there are obviously<br>various options<br>but they're all problematic for one<br>reason or another<br>the options include capital gains taxes<br>land taxes wealth taxes<br>inheritance or wealth transfer taxes<br>like the lifetime gifts tax in ireland<br>and more progressive income taxes<br>and i note that at least some oecd<br>economies economists favor a combination<br>of a capital gains tax and in<br>inheritance tax<br>on the income transfer side the current<br>options in new zealand include more<br>generous welfare benefits more generous<br>tax credits such as the family tax<br>credit uh linking core benefit rates to<br>prices<br>as well as wages as they are now<br>uh<br>and increasing the age of eligibility<br>for new zealand super for say to 70<br>years<br>in relation to housing which uh matt<br>will probably speak more about um<br>housing is critical to wealth inequality<br>and it's interesting that new zealand<br>successfully increased<br>home ownership rates<br>very substantially during the immediate<br>post-war period and significantly<br>increase the social housing stock as a<br>proportion of the total housing stock<br>and ideally we need to do both these<br>things again because we've been<br>backwards for the last 40 years<br>i realize that will be difficult not<br>least fiscally<br>so to conclude<br>as an egalitarian i lament the current<br>levels of income in wealth inequality<br>locally and globally<br>i think they're thoroughly bad<br>i accept however that there's no optimal<br>level of economic inequality but i would<br>prefer less for the reasons i've<br>indicated<br>there is however no easy way to achieve<br>this goal but in my view we should at<br>least try<br>well thank you very much jonathan for<br>those rich insights and your perspective<br>and including some very very fresh data<br>so that was great to keep us up to date<br>with the um latest data that's been<br>released there so thank you very much<br>jonathan matt let's um turn to uh<br>to your uh insights please<br>uh good thanks everybody thank you for<br>uh the invitation to speak um<br>uh helen clark was right wealth and<br>equality has increased uh in this<br>country over the last two years we've<br>genie wealth index has increased from 67<br>two years ago to 69 or 70 depending on<br>which source you look at<br>um<br>our wealth inequality is about double in<br>on the genie measure of income<br>inequality substantially higher but<br>that's in line with most if not all<br>other countries around the world wealth<br>is just less equal when you look uh<br>around the world compared to income<br>the good news is that new zealand is at<br>the bottom end of the wealth<br>inequality uh when you look across<br>countries we're in the<br>uh i guess you'd say the best or the<br>least um uh inequal uh unequal uh 20 of<br>countries uh around the world uh and<br>we're actually moving<br>down that scale towards more inequality<br>in relative terms uh compared to other<br>countries<br>so that's the good news of the story now<br>of course the reason we're talking about<br>wealth distribution is because over the<br>last two years in particular asset<br>prices have<br>essentially gone vertical and in new<br>zealand of course it's housing of all<br>assets that matters the most housing is<br>about half<br>our net wealth of the average household<br>in this country it's a big deal and of<br>course prices have gone uh<br>not quite vertical but not too far from<br>it<br>the average house new zealand's now one<br>million dollars uh the average house<br>price in auckland city 1.7 million<br>dollars these numbers are uh shocking<br>in my view<br>new zealand has the worst performing<br>housing market in the oecd<br>over the last 30 years in terms of real<br>uh<br>increase in prices so we've got a<br>serious problem<br>but<br>in terms of wealth distribution housing<br>has actually been had a negative impact<br>on inequality<br>uh a really interesting study from<br>treasury recently showed that the<br>increase in house prices has improved or<br>reduced inequality within the group of<br>homeowners which is a large group 64 of<br>houses uh are owner occupied in this<br>country<br>it's increased inequality between<br>non-homeowners and homeowners but that's<br>a small enough group that the within<br>homeowner group effect dominates so<br>surprisingly housing has actually had a<br>negative impact on<br>wealth and equality even though wealth<br>inequality overall has increased in the<br>so yeah treasury uh 10 uh increase in<br>house prices reduces uh wealth<br>inequality by 0.7 which is quite a<br>substantial uh effect so look why does<br>wealth inequality matter and i think<br>there's two uh at least two reasons why<br>we need to think about it or it's worth<br>considering the first is what's the<br>relationship between wealth distribution<br>and social outcomes that we care about<br>does chain do changes in wealth<br>distribution tell us something about<br>outcomes for people on the ground<br>and the second i think with this<br>particularly with respect to housing is<br>is the increase in housing uh telling us<br>something leading to exclusion uh which<br>for such an important asset class so<br>looking at the literature on wealth<br>inequality it's not a huge literature<br>because i think about wealth is hard to<br>uh hard to measure particularly in this<br>country we don't uh tax it<br>the relationship between wealth<br>distribution and social outcomes like<br>life expectancy education outcomes<br>infant mortality is surprisingly<br>ambiguous<br>essentially there is no consistent<br>relationship with wealth distribution<br>those outcomes in the way there is with<br>that other measure of inequality income<br>inequality<br>so<br>in terms of a metric that you can look<br>at and infer bad things are happening on<br>the ground for real people wealth<br>distribution or changes in wealth<br>distribution<br>isn't a particularly good measure income<br>inequality is much more interesting and<br>arguably important<br>compared to wealth<br>even though wealth of course has been on<br>the news over the last couple of years<br>in terms of house prices<br>homeownership rates have fallen<br>substantially i think as jonathan<br>mentioned uh 73 homeownership rate uh 30<br>years ago all the way down to 64 today<br>the change who's who's won and lost from<br>that fallen home ownership<br>20 and 30 year olds have lost by more<br>than other age categories but not by<br>that much<br>another interesting thing first time<br>share of first home buyers of all home<br>sales has been roughly static over the<br>last 20 years there hasn't been a<br>collapse in first-time buyers they're<br>still buying about a quarter of all<br>home purchases<br>so<br>on its face the picture in terms of<br>exclusion despite this massive increase<br>in house prices is that<br>not too many people are being locked out<br>of the market in the way we might have<br>expected but one final data point on<br>this which comes from australia i<br>couldn't find an equivalent number for<br>new zealand what percentage of first<br>home buyers are getting help from their<br>parents<br>in 2010 12 years ago in australia that<br>number was three percent today it's 60<br>percent and if there's anything like uh<br>something similar going on here in new<br>zealand that could be a serious uh<br>question for those who whose parents<br>don't own homes under the market<br>they may well be excluded and that's<br>potentially a very serious issue um so<br>look uh i'll wrap it up there but i<br>think you know<br>in terms of the outlook um<br>it's been an interesting picture<br>statistically it hasn't yet turned into<br>serious outcomes at the front line uh on<br>social outcomes but ahead of us now<br>we've got inflation we've got interest<br>rate rises on the horizon we've got<br>rents going up by 10 in the last year<br>rents have been a safety valve in the<br>new zealand housing market we've had<br>persistent increases in house prices<br>over the last three decades more than<br>anywhere else in the oecd<br>rents have been pretty stable in this<br>country and now they're taking off<br>so it's<br>potentially we're in uncharted territory<br>and potentially uh interesting and um<br>dangerous territory i think<br>over the next two years potentially<br>back to you anna<br>thanks very much matt thanks for very<br>sharply reminding us of the importance<br>of housing to equality issues and my<br>kids will certainly be hoping that the<br>australian data applies to new zealand<br>as well um<br>thanks also for you know sharply um<br>reminding us of of the importance of<br>looking at income versus wealth<br>inequality because there are some<br>different um there are some significant<br>differences there what i'd like to do<br>now is move on to a few questions the<br>first question is actually going to be<br>addressed to both of you<br>and that is let's say you've got a magic<br>policy wand<br>both of you um express some desire to<br>reduce inequality perhaps in different<br>forms but what's the number one policy<br>intervention with this magic policy wand<br>what's the number one policy<br>intervention that you would make to<br>you want me to start hannah go ahead<br>jonathan yes okay uh so i don't think<br>there's one<br>magic wand here<br>we need a combination of measures and<br>those measures would need to be applied<br>over a significant period of time to<br>make a substantive<br>and sustained difference so i would be<br>as i was sort of indicating in my<br>remarks trying to pull both the tax<br>levers and the income transfer levers<br>but maybe also labor market um<br>levers one could move as well but i<br>would i would focus on the tax<br>transfer system uh i'm not a tax policy<br>expert but from what i've read i think<br>there is a reasonably convincing case<br>for a capital gains tax a recently<br>comprehensive capital gains tax and i<br>certainly think there's a case for some<br>kind of inheritance tax<br>or um<br>lifetime gift tax<br>on the on the transfer side<br>i would<br>argue as i have over many years for a<br>further increase in core welfare<br>benefits and for more generous uh tax<br>credits particularly the family tax<br>credit<br>um and i would also argue for uh uh<br>increasing the age of eligibility for<br>new zealand super<br>uh we now have a situation where an ever<br>increasing number of people<br>age 65 plus are<br>working and yet they're eligible for<br>universal<br>income transfer<br>and i don't think that is either fair or<br>reasonable<br>in the kind of circumstances where so<br>a raft of measures um<br>many of which would be politically very<br>difficult to introduce<br>so lots of policy ones is what you would<br>like matt<br>fix the housing market uh some might be<br>a broken record on this i'm afraid but<br>look housing really matters when you<br>look at the before and after housing<br>cost um data particularly brian perry at<br>msd<br>housing's enormous i mean it really is<br>new zealand<br>you know we're pretty good on a lot of<br>things but we're terrible at housing um<br>and it affects everybody it affects<br>those at the bottom uh the most actually<br>uh higher proportion of income<br>goes on housing if you're in the bottom<br>end of income and it's a big number so<br>um and if you want to get really<br>specific about nothing to fix and<br>housing it is the housing supply<br>that's not more subsidies uh and it's<br>convincing councils to release more land<br>and build more water infrastructure in<br>particular and so the very specific<br>measure if i had a magic wand that would<br>be to improve council's ability to fund<br>water infrastructure get the pricing<br>right get their access to finance right<br>um get the incentives right and maybe<br>that's already happened with recent<br>policy changes and then watch a thousand<br>hours bloom and i think you'll see you<br>know the basic model in all of this is<br>that good policy policy that works<br>policy that targets um the right areas<br>um is going to fix well it's going to<br>raise all boats and you're going to see<br>um inequality among lots of other things<br>moving in the right direction<br>and could i quickly respond just simply<br>to say i agree with uh matt that housing<br>is absolutely pivotal but it's not<br>enough so it's it's necessary but not<br>sufficient and i for one don't support<br>the idea of just simply paving ever more<br>green fields with concrete<br>however the water infrastructure is<br>funded i'd much prefer we increase our<br>housing density<br>and go up but i appreciate the problem<br>there is nimbyism<br>and that's a political problem<br>but<br>from an environmental point of view uh i<br>think we need to ensure we keep our<br>green belts around our cities and we<br>protect valuable agricultural land from<br>ever<br>greater sort of increasions from um<br>urban sprawl which also has big<br>implications for transport and so forth<br>anyway that's enough for me can i<br>respond to that<br>if you don't mind um look i i don't<br>necessarily disagree at least in gross<br>terms with jonathan but let's just get<br>serious about the trade-offs here you<br>know um<br>productive agricultural land<br>human consequences from having a<br>persistent severe under supply of<br>housing that means you've got<br>overcrowding and damp homes people<br>getting sick<br>high share of their incomes going on<br>housing as opposed to everything else<br>they'd like to enjoy in life now that's<br>the trade-off and i think it's pretty<br>steep and as nice as you know potatoes<br>growing in productive land immediately<br>outside auckland might be<br>um i'm much more concerned uh about the<br>thousands tens of thousands of people<br>that are effectively locked out of the<br>housing market right now so um you know<br>the trade-off's very steep here but we<br>can go up as well as out<br>and indeed and we should do<br>one a policy one that i don't recall<br>either of you mention mentioning is the<br>proposed income insurance scheme<br>what do you think this would do to<br>i'm going look i don't think it's going<br>to do much actually it's workers that<br>are paying into the pool it's workers<br>that are drawing out from the pool um<br>you know compared to um other things you<br>know superannuation other transfers tax<br>um housing uh look i don't think the<br>schemes uh i think it's gonna be large<br>pretty much a wash in terms of<br>distribution<br>yes i would tend to agree with that but<br>i would add two other elements<br>the first is what impact might<br>an unemployment and health insurance<br>scheme have<br>uh core benefit rates and the benefit<br>system generally there are concerns that<br>some people are how i know that it would<br>result in a less generous benefits<br>benefit system which would then impact<br>particularly on disadvantaged people um<br>i'm not sure that the international<br>evidence is consistent with that view in<br>fact i i think it's it's not<br>the second aspect which i think we need<br>to think about is what impact would<br>increasing the amount of social<br>insurance in our system moving beyond<br>acc and into unemployment and health<br>what will that do to the political<br>economy of the welfare state and the way<br>which people<br>ordinary voters think about the welfare<br>state my reading of the international<br>evidence<br>is that social insurance<br>tends to<br>enhance support<br>uh for uh<br>the welfare state as a as an overall<br>kind of entity and it does that because<br>when people are paying<br>inter schemes and getting earnings<br>related uh benefits if they need it<br>because they become unemployed there's a<br>sense of reciprocity uh people<br>contribute and then they get assistance<br>if they need it<br>in a way that a tax-funded flat-rate<br>means-tested system of the kind that we<br>have doesn't generate that kind of<br>perspective so very simply uh i think<br>there's a possibility that enhancing<br>social insurance could actually help<br>strengthen<br>the welfare state and to that extent<br>actually help um reduce inequality long<br>run but i may be wrong<br>jonathan there's a specific question<br>that's come through for you um<br>you um you mentioned that<br>incoming inequality is is influenced in<br>part by the people who are voting is<br>there a case for reforming<br>uh<br>the way we vote to reduce the the<br>influence of older people and wealthier<br>people<br>well having<br>said in my remarks that i believe in<br>equal citizenship rights i certainly<br>have no desire to reduce the<br>political rights of particular<br>sections of the community<br>there is a case for reducing the<br>voting age from 18 to 16. i happen to<br>support that but i don't think it would<br>make a huge difference<br>um but it might if we did ensure that<br>younger people are more likely to vote<br>because it would mean that people would<br>start voting at school<br>and it would get them familiar with the<br>whole process of being a citizen and<br>contributing to public life<br>but no i i wouldn't i don't think<br>changing the electoral system is going<br>to make any difference in the overall<br>scheme of things to um<br>to uh<br>and a question that will take you both<br>into some slightly different space why<br>does the toolbox to reduce income<br>inequality not reach beyond tax transfer<br>maybe even housing mat<br>and include investment in healthy early<br>child development and skills<br>matt would you like to start with that<br>one<br>well look i think it does i mean the<br>whole idea of the social investment<br>program under the previous government<br>was to do exactly that to find<br>opportunities to invest early and make a<br>huge difference um<br>you know with data it's you need data to<br>find these opportunities and it's really<br>hard to do um especially from the center<br>um that was that was a whole idea so<br>that absolutely is part of the toolkit<br>the problem is the technical difficulty<br>of actually achieving it um in a system<br>from the center it's it's just hard to<br>do<br>but i think it's i think it's going to<br>happen<br>and i'd completely agree with matt uh<br>we only had five minutes so<br>it's not possible to kind of cover the<br>whole raft of policies that influence um<br>uh income and wealth distribution<br>which you know<br>obviously vast ranges a range of<br>policies have have some impact<br>covering health housing uh education<br>tertiary education and so forth<br>so that would certainly be another one<br>that you might look at uh adding to the<br>toolkit there<br>let's move on to it ready we already uh<br>can spend quite a lot that education<br>there is certainly<br>a case i think<br>uh for giving more weight<br>to the early years relative to perhaps<br>the later years of education um<br>but we already invest quite heavily in<br>thanks let's<br>perhaps take you to a broader um<br>question there's been quite a theme of<br>the impact of covert including on<br>inequality through a number of the<br>presentations during the day<br>i wonder your views about whether covet<br>has permanently changed the dynamics of<br>inequality in new zealand is it has it<br>done something permanent that's changed<br>the dynamics or is it<br>you know just another transitory impact<br>that um<br>that doesn't fundamentally change<br>anything about the the the inequality<br>i can have a go with that<br>i<br>i thought of maybe this is<br>oversimplifying it but i've thought of<br>covert as an exogenous shock that's come<br>not as the product of economic malaise<br>or male investment within the economy<br>but it's just been come<br>from the outside it's hit us pretty hard<br>um and it's caused disruption while it's<br>here<br>but i've long thought that ultimately<br>the fundamental<br>dynamics within the economy don't need<br>to change in response um and we can<br>have this sort of bullish view that we<br>can bounce back rapidly<br>re re-establish the networks that have<br>been lost um they're still there they<br>may not be connected right now but they<br>can be re-established quickly because<br>the fundamentals there isn't that normal<br>thing you get in a recession of having<br>to reorganize the economy<br>shut down businesses free up capital<br>shift to somewhere else and all of that<br>i think<br>so i've always felt that the recovery<br>from covert will be faster than it will<br>be from other recessions<br>the thing that gives me pause though is<br>that policy settings may not go back to<br>what they were now we've got inflation<br>and a lot of fiscal impulse um still in<br>the pipeline<br>um and uh<br>also zoom you know just the fact that<br>people might be working keep working<br>from home after all of this those are<br>potential<br>longer-lasting structural changes<br>none of it<br>seems to have any obvious direct<br>implication for inequality<br>um you've got you know the one thing you<br>would say is you've got a bigger<br>government coming out on the other side<br>of this um and that may have uh well<br>have comp uh consequences for inequality<br>but in terms of covert per se<br>i i can't see anything for inequality in<br>that<br>jonathan do you share that can i say i<br>absolutely agree with matt but i would<br>add two things first that if you think<br>about this globally many countries have<br>experienced significant increase uh<br>increase in their levels of public debt<br>and<br>that runs the risk of exacerbating<br>intergenerational inequality<br>um particularly given that many of the<br>people who've suffered quite a lot from<br>covet have been<br>young people<br>in school or in early<br>years of work<br>or in tertiary education the second<br>thing though is this and this is<br>we will take years to find out<br>but i'm sitting in an office across the<br>road from an encampment of thousands of<br>people<br>most of whom are probably low income or<br>unemployed um or retired or semi-retired<br>um<br>many of them i think quite sort of<br>marginalized from the mainstream of new<br>zealand's society<br>and many of them are very aggrieved um<br>by what covert has done to them uh some<br>of them have lost their jobs because<br>they've refused to be vaccinated uh and<br>so on um<br>my sense is that covet has among other<br>things exposed<br>and heightened<br>some some significant<br>um<br>tensions<br>uh and and dislocations within our<br>society<br>and and that concerns me<br>and and the effects of that could be<br>quite long lasting<br>i i hope not but<br>we'll i guess we'll find out<br>one of the other<br>sorry just to pick up on something<br>jonathan said inflation of course what<br>we are getting out of code that is<br>inflation not just us right around the<br>world<br>that is that does have consequences for<br>inequality that will uh tend to hurt<br>people at the bottom end that's what<br>inflation does<br>um<br>the good news is that uh certainly i<br>think for new zealand it will be<br>transitory in 18 months we will be back<br>within one to three percent<br>um that's and substantially because we<br>well you know i've actually looked at<br>the history of inflation and they are<br>about two years long uh on average and<br>actually new zealand's pretty well<br>placed to recover from inflation we the<br>institutions are sound we've got an<br>independent central bank nice clean<br>legislation it's a good setup and we've<br>got low public debt and that really<br>counts it makes the promise credible<br>when the reserve bank says we're getting<br>back to target now consider the<br>situation in europe christine lagarde<br>the president of the european central<br>bank<br>has got one or two or three members that<br>are going to exit<br>rather disorderly in a disorderly way if<br>interest rates rise too much further at<br>least hitting 160 percent public debt<br>greece is more than 200 percent uh<br>it's a serious problem when interest<br>rates go up when it's time to fight<br>inflation so they're sitting there<br>hoping that um their inflation really is<br>transitory and just cobit<br>nothing to do with all the zero interest<br>rates and uh spending um we'll wait and<br>see but for europe where debt is high uh<br>inflation uh is a serious problem so you<br>know as if any reminder when they<br>needed the value of fiscal prudence uh<br>and a clean balance sheet um<br>new zealand's going to win uh relatives<br>certainly to europe and a lot of other<br>countries in the oecd coming out of this<br>well i agree with that now but just one<br>i guess<br>question mark and that is uh what russia<br>does over the coming weeks and months<br>and then what the response might be<br>okay that could potentially have<br>profound implications<br>for<br>oil markets and gas markets uh with with<br>long-term um uh increases in fossil fuel<br>prices which may be good for climate<br>change in the long run<br>but but uh won't be good for global<br>inflation isn't that wonderful to be in<br>a country that's<br>crowned in a 40 and not a 150<br>um my gosh at nervous times in italy<br>and i think we're going to have to wrap<br>this session up um now but of course<br>these topics including inflation will be<br>picked up again tomorrow tomorrow um<br>when we have adrian orr<br>presenting to us<br>huge topics i know we've only had time<br>to scratch the surface of of some of<br>these<br>and we certainly haven't got into the<br>data issues and we've really focused<br>more on on new zealand than global<br>inequality and that's a whole story and<br>it's in its own right as well<br>and i'm not sure whether your response<br>to the covert question would have been<br>the same if the question had been on<br>global global inequality um but you know<br>thank you so much for your very very<br>rich insights the expertise that you<br>bought the um<br>uh reminding us of this new data that's<br>just out jonathan and and uh matt<br>reminding us not to take our off that<br>housing market because that really<br>matters greatly for uh for income<br>disparities in new zealand so thank you<br>so much thanks also to our audience you<br>guys have been sending the questions<br>through slido um really appreciate those<br>and um with much gratitude thank you<br>very much to our panelists<br>kia ora uh fantastic session and<br>foreshadowed much of tomorrow's program<br>where we will be touching on inflation<br>we'll be touching on fiscal policy and<br>touching on housing infrastructure and<br>the last comments there about the<br>geopolitical scene we've got a session<br>tomorrow uh late in the morning on<br>geopolitics as well<br>so i guess it goes to show the uh the<br>interlinked nature of some of these<br>topics<br>we're moving now to another session the<br>last panel session of today before we uh<br>welcome jim bolger back into the last<br>session so this one is going to be<br>really interesting productivity<br>immigration and labor<br>critical issues the borders have been<br>closed new zealand's had a long history<br>of struggling to<br>shift the dial on productivity and i<br>will hand back across to stephen joyce<br>who's going to facilitate this<br>discussion for the next panel stephen<br>over to you thanks very much matt and a<br>very good previous panel no challenge to<br>our new panelists<br>to to get the discussion going as<br>strongly as that but we'll we will<br>definitely give it a decent crack<br>we have uh two<br>uh i would say uh valuable uh uh<br>participants in this debate firstly<br>uh<br>we have john gibson professor of<br>economics the waikato management school<br>and simon chapel who's the director of<br>institute for governance and policy<br>studies at victoria university of<br>wellington the subject is the labor<br>market immigration policy to enhance<br>productivity and the labor market has<br>already become quite a strong theme<br>through this<br>conference forum to date and the reason<br>for that is there's so much change going<br>on certainly covert has caused a fair<br>bit of it in terms of closing the new<br>zealand labour market off from the rest<br>of the world for the last two years<br>but we also have a government that has<br>made absolutely no secret that it wants<br>to change immigration policy and quite<br>significantly<br>and we have<br>labor market policies internally<br>which also signal quite significant<br>changes and depending on your<br>perspective<br>they're either long overdue or a<br>worrying return to rigidity in the<br>labour markets take your pick<br>and so to try and make sense of this for<br>us<br>we have john gibson and simon chapel i<br>should note that simon unfortunately has<br>a technology issue in wellington<br>hopefully unrelated to what's been going<br>down there with the protest so he'll be<br>coming to us in audio only<br>meanwhile john gibson looks like he's<br>actually orbiting the planet at this<br>point with his uh<br>with his uh backdrop so john uh uh<br>welcome to you with your uh excellent<br>perspective from above us all<br>um could you uh launch into it and uh by<br>the way gentlemen uh about seven minutes<br>each to lay out your stall and then<br>let's do the discussion thanks very much<br>john<br>uh perfect thanks very much stephen so<br>ukraine's actually just at the back of<br>my shoulder if you can see uh there and<br>we might talk about that in a moment so<br>over the last four censuses in new<br>zealand the foreign-born share has gone<br>from roughly one in six people 18<br>to now more than one and four people uh<br>26<br>and it's worth thinking about how<br>unusual that is if we compare ourselves<br>with um<br>small oecd countries and so countries of<br>around about you know between two<br>million and six million eight million it<br>doesn't really matter uh almost all of<br>whom are<br>right behind me in this picture of<br>europe at night um<br>they've seen almost no change in the<br>foreign laws year and so in new zealand<br>we've now got twice as large of a<br>foreign-born share<br>as our comparative countries if we<br>compare ourselves with australia<br>australia has always had a larger<br>foreign-born share but we've basically<br>very rapidly closed the gap and so the<br>foreign-born share in new zealand<br>proportionately rose 44<br>while in australia it only rose 26<br>and if you think about it for a moment<br>then<br>it's pretty clear this is almost<br>entirely policy driven rather than being<br>driven by economic fundamentals and so<br>the distance or the time it takes<br>someone to fly from new zealand to<br>sydney three hours once we can do it<br>again<br>within europe someone deciding to move<br>to europe to a small oecd country there<br>can cover 750 million people and so<br>you've got a large market you've got a<br>market which is much richer and which<br>actually has seen much faster<br>productivity growth and so it's<br>surprising that we've got such a strong<br>inward growth in migration from from the<br>stocks i prefer working with the census<br>compared with comparators<br>and at the same time as as you know and<br>as many people watching will know our<br>productivity record has been pretty<br>dismal so we hide that partly by working<br>longer hours and so the correct way to<br>look at this is in real gdp per hour<br>worked and compared to the top half of<br>the oecd which is something we once<br>aspired to rejoin uh we're working about<br>67 as productively and so gdp real gdp<br>per hour worked in new zealand is only<br>about two-thirds as high as it is for<br>the top half of the oecd<br>if we compare ourselves to the bottom<br>half and the bottom half includes a lot<br>of these small countries in europe which<br>up until 30 years ago faced really bad<br>incentives under central planning well<br>they've got far far higher productivity<br>growth and so it's only greece and<br>mexico for whom our productivity growth<br>has been better<br>and so we've had this massive growth in<br>immigration we've had this stagnant<br>largely stagnant productivity growth and<br>what growth we have had in productivity<br>has been primarily in the primary sector<br>and it primarily occurred in the 1980s<br>and the 1990s in the early post-reform<br>era not in the period since 2000 and the<br>other symptom and i talked about this<br>last year is that we're an increasingly<br>inward-looking economy and so the share<br>of foreign trade to gdp in new zealand<br>is far lower than it is for other small<br>oecd countries and it's going down<br>rather than up and so we're getting more<br>and more inward looking we're focusing<br>much more on the non-traders<br>particularly on on housing real estate<br>and that's again a sign of an economy<br>which isn't terribly productive and and<br>isn't terribly um competitive in some<br>sense and so again it makes it<br>surprising that uh we would have such<br>strong inward migration compared with<br>places which are doing doing much better<br>now the problem is and and the<br>hypothesis that the inward migration is<br>raising the real exchange rate which is<br>skewing incentives towards the<br>non-tradable sector is very closely<br>associated with michael riddell former<br>reserve bank economist<br>i'm a microeconomist rather than a<br>macroeconomist and so<br>it's difficult for microeconomists to<br>look at macro evidence and say well you<br>know am i fully convinced by this<br>because the standard of proof is quite<br>different between things and so i'm<br>going to talk about two micro um bits of<br>information which which people may or<br>may not know and which might be relevant<br>to this so the first one relates to<br>housing and so what we've seen is that<br>um for a standard deviation higher um<br>foreign-born share in new zealand at the<br>very small level at the aerial unit<br>level which is the suburb level then we<br>see the native born home ownership rate<br>go down by one-sixth of a standard<br>deviation and much of it occurs not<br>directly but through spillover effects<br>and so if we're going to have a big<br>inward migration push then having really<br>restrictive land market settings in<br>urban areas as matt burgess just talked<br>about was really inconsistent with that<br>and so we've got the worst of both<br>worlds<br>the second<br>little bit of micro information i'll<br>talk about because it's not all doom and<br>gloom on migration programs and they're<br>not all cut of the same cloth<br>from the uh get-go of the rse the<br>recognized seasonal employment scheme uh<br>then i've been involved along with the<br>world bank along with david mckenzie<br>along with people in wellington and<br>analyzing them and so we do see pretty<br>big productivity effects of that<br>particular migration scheme and so when<br>we were able to look at physical<br>productivity how many uh apples or how<br>many grapefruit or other things that<br>people were picking the foreign workers<br>were picking 50 percent more or more<br>productive than the new zealand contract<br>labor and about 80 percent more than the<br>casual labor backpackers and so there<br>was a really big micro level<br>productivity shock and that showed up at<br>the sectoral level because we have about<br>one billion dollars per year pre-covered<br>uh extra exports from kiwifruit apple<br>and wine which are the three big sectors<br>affected by rsc<br>um and last year or late 2020 there was<br>a report by nz-ier which fed into the<br>productivity commission which emphasized<br>the idea of substitution but actually<br>when we look at this particular example<br>then there's much more story about<br>complementarity because most of the<br>employers who had now a guaranteed<br>source of labor from the rc workers from<br>vanuatu and so forth then expanded and<br>actually we're employing more new<br>zealand workers as well and so it's a<br>rather more complicated picture than<br>than we typically get<br>so<br>because you asked me to to<br>speculate or contemplate on the issue is<br>this a good time for us to keep the door<br>shut and i would argue that actually<br>despite the the macro level productivity<br>story it's not necessarily a terribly<br>good time to keep the door stuck shut<br>and there's a kind of smugness if i'm<br>going to put it there then and last year<br>ellen bullard used the kind hermit<br>kingdom it might now be the smug hermit<br>kingdom rather than kind her kingdom<br>where people assume people in new<br>zealand assume that we can just turn the<br>tap on or off because of course people<br>want to come here and it's not clear to<br>me that that's that's true it's not<br>clear it was ever true and it's<br>certainly not clear that it is true<br>currently and so just even thinking<br>about seasonal migration for the moment<br>when new zealand first set this scheme<br>up australia struggled to get theirs<br>going and dick bedford emeritus<br>professor here at the university pointed<br>out that once australia got their scheme<br>up and running they would be a preferred<br>destination for many pacific island<br>workers and indeed that proved to be<br>true and the disruptions to covet is<br>going to make that even more so but the<br>big picture here is that starting three<br>decades ago the world economy<br>basically absorbed a huge meal of<br>opening up a new frontier of labor which<br>was a billion workers who were stuck<br>previously behind the iron curtain and<br>behind really bad incentives of central<br>planning in china and eastern europe and<br>certainly with some disruption it<br>absorbed them<br>brought about this era of globalization<br>brought about a really big fall in<br>absolute inequality across countries but<br>very disruptive within countries um and<br>now it's looking for more labor so it's<br>no surprise that china is very very<br>active in africa and it's not just there<br>for raw materials it's there for<br>youthful labor markets because it's run<br>out of labor the east asia region of the<br>asia development bank is going to see<br>the working age population fall by 200<br>million people between now and 2050 and<br>so there's a huge competition for labor<br>it used to be just the skilled level but<br>it's increasingly at the at the less<br>skilled level as well and it's just not<br>at all clear that we're as well<br>positioned as we think we are to just<br>automatically turn on the tap and find<br>that there's the swelling supply and so<br>with that i'll i'll leave it<br>for for simon to pick up great great<br>work thank you john um and a lot there<br>to digest i've written down about four<br>things i want to come back to which<br>we'll see if we manage in the time<br>available um simon you've been listening<br>to john there um it'd be interesting in<br>your perspective at this point uh let's<br>try and keep it to the seventh i think<br>john almost got to ten minutes but try<br>and keep it to the seven uh and um and<br>then we'll get time for some discussion<br>at the end simon<br>right thank you stephen and thank you<br>john um<br>i i guess my starting point is to say<br>that new zealand has a long run history<br>of relatively poor productivity that<br>probably dates back to the uh<br>the second world war<br>and in the biggest picture we've had two<br>broad explanations for this one is we've<br>basically had poor government policy be<br>that spend tax regulate the second<br>explanation is the tyranny of distance<br>argument that that john has has touched<br>on um<br>in terms of the<br>small economies in europe and the<br>distance from major markets<br>we also need to be aware that<br>productivity here is not to be all and<br>end all of well-being it's important but<br>policy doesn't start<br>we'll stop there<br>so if we're thinking of policy<br>behind poor productivity to what extent<br>can we conceive of immigration as a<br>policy solution<br>economic theory says the simplest model<br>of immigration says that<br>there's a relatively smaller media gain<br>from immigration there is a big<br>redistribution from<br>the uh factor that's becoming uh less<br>scarce to the scarce factor<br>but in the longer term<br>with constant returns we're simply<br>replicating uh production processes at<br>infinitum with immigration<br>so no gains in the long term uh the<br>minute you complexify it the conclusion<br>gets more complicated<br>but your best bet for a productivity<br>impact from immigration is if<br>people who come in uh bust up production<br>functions they come in with new ideas<br>new ways of doing things and they<br>innovate<br>um<br>the challenge of course is that<br>we have great difficulty in identifying<br>those people in the first instance and<br>in the second instance ensuring that<br>they<br>um come to new zealand<br>in terms of the evidence we have john's<br>touched on some of the<br>recent relationship between very high<br>rates of immigration<br>and a lack of a productivity response<br>and this is not really very surprising<br>because if we look at the income survey<br>data from the household labor force<br>survey we find that on average<br>immigrants earn pretty much the same or<br>slightly lower wages than new zealanders<br>as a whole so that suggests on average<br>they're about as productive as the<br>average new zealander we're not going to<br>get a big immigration gain there all the<br>evidence suggests if you're going to run<br>an immigration policy you want to get<br>people who are not like the average you<br>either want people at the bottom end of<br>the labor market who are very different<br>from the average or the top end of the<br>labor market<br>obviously they have very different<br>now<br>the issue further issue<br>sorry<br>is if we don't have access to<br>the sorts of scale economies that europe<br>has because we don't have the population<br>can we get there through a big new<br>zealand strategy well if we had three<br>times our population we had 15 million<br>people we would still be 15 million<br>people miles from anywhere so the short<br>answer is no it's highly unlikely that<br>big new zealand is going to overcome the<br>in terms of um<br>a couple of the issues raised by john in<br>terms of census data we need to be aware<br>that in addition to<br>more people coming over the border as<br>citizens or as residents we've had<br>enormous growth in people coming to new<br>zealand temporarily with a right to work<br>and in fact the growth here has in some<br>cases been larger um working holiday<br>visas have exploded students who have<br>the right to work in new zealand uh<br>those numbers have exploded in some ways<br>it almost like seems like we're selling<br>the right to work in new zealand rather<br>than the the right to study so numbers<br>have been very large<br>uh in terms of<br>what's happened through the covert<br>lockdown which is a really interesting<br>experiment<br>we observe ourselves with<br>a rate of unemployment that it's<br>historically<br>at its lowest level since we first<br>started collecting the data in 1986.<br>correlation of course is not causation<br>um<br>and the reserve bank indeed has argued<br>that the structural unemployment rate uh<br>has risen as a consequence of no longer<br>being able to use migrants to fill skill<br>shortages<br>now if that was the case we would<br>anticipate in the current environment<br>seeing a lot more wage pressure if<br>structural unemployment has gone up but<br>we've got<br>wage inflation at the moment massively<br>lagging consumer price inflation in a<br>very low unemployment environment so<br>it's not a plausible uh story<br>where i get to overall on this is that<br>broadly speaking<br>migration is very second order in terms<br>of our productivity<br>yes we do need people and i would argue<br>we need people who are at the high<br>school the end of the distribution we<br>probably could do with fewer people<br>than we've had in recent times<br>the issue here is in terms of<br>productivity do we buy the smarts from<br>overseas or do we build it in new<br>zealand and i think historically we have<br>seen buying the smarts as a reason for<br>not doing building well in this country<br>we need to focus much more on building<br>the skill sets of people in new zealand<br>and doing that effectively rather than<br>trying in effect the last vestige of<br>central planning in new zealand is<br>picking winners in terms of immigrants<br>we've tried it it hasn't worked<br>particularly well we need to focus on<br>the real things<br>but building people<br>thanks steven thanks john thank you<br>simon um great start everybody just want<br>to pick up on one thing<br>because happened already today somebody<br>else has said that we're not seeing any<br>wage inflation yet isn't it possible<br>that we're just not measuring it yet<br>certainly anecdotally<br>and maybe it's just in the industries i<br>walk in but wage inflation<br>is about to hit us fairly hard i think<br>going on construction sector going on uh<br>the professional services sector uh the<br>farming sector you know we're starting<br>to rack it up so maybe it's just not<br>showing in the numbers yet would you say<br>that potentially<br>um i i'm uncertain about that i think<br>you can tell a plausible story along<br>those lines every time new wage data<br>comes out though i'm struggling to see<br>it in the data<br>so one story is the sort of the long and<br>variable lag story which the reserve<br>bank is running with and it's possibly<br>true<br>a second story is that and and this is<br>one i've recently started running is the<br>new public sector act effectively gives<br>massive monopsony power to the public<br>sector commission and is therefore very<br>effective in screwing down public<br>servants wages which effectively are<br>frozen and this is spilled over into the<br>private sector since the private sector<br>don't need to compete with the public<br>sector and so in fact the public sector<br>act has been very good in terms of<br>lowering the rate of unemployment at<br>which we can comfortably operate<br>so that that's one possible story uh<br>there but i mean i guess stephen the<br>proof of the pudding there is going to<br>be in the eating over the next year to<br>18 months whether that wage pressure<br>genuinely starts coming through uh and<br>the reserve bank have indicated in their<br>position okay well let's leave that<br>there at the moment because i don't<br>think we can answer it we could we could<br>trade anecdote for anecdote i'm sure for<br>some time um gentlemen the the<br>this<br>what does what does good look like i<br>mean how real is this isolation argument<br>because i i've been grappling with it<br>you know the time that i was in<br>government and there's no doubt about it<br>this country is a long way from markets<br>some would say that our high levels of<br>productivity historically post world war<br>ii<br>uh and leading up to britain joining the<br>eec was really because we were uh<br>located right next door to the uk we<br>were britain's farm and and there was<br>uh effectively we as soon as they joined<br>the ec we were shunted off to the south<br>pacific in geographical terms and<br>haven't been back since<br>uh is<br>is it realistic even uh what or what are<br>the tools that we can pull to to to to<br>defeat this you know geographic<br>isolation i mean or is it a case of we<br>are where we are john first<br>it's true that that certain costs have<br>fallen dramatically for spatially<br>transacting what we're doing at the<br>moment right so we've got some people in<br>wellington and so forth but um the the<br>paradoxical<br>um argument is that because of that then<br>what we demand becomes ever more complex<br>and so many of the things which require<br>um actual face-to-face have put more of<br>a premium and so rather than being the<br>case that you know the the thomas<br>friedman the world has become flat the<br>argument is very much that actually the<br>world became more and more curved and<br>and location became much more important<br>and of course we were in the wrong place<br>you raise the point you know what what<br>levers can policymakers pull so a few<br>years ago um david mckenzie uh who's a<br>new zealander at the world bank and i uh<br>surveyed the best and brightest from new<br>zealand and a few other countries and so<br>these are people that all central<br>planners and immigration would love to<br>have as inward immigrants you know they<br>were math olympians chemistry olympians<br>daxes of good schools and and so on and<br>so forth and by age 40 for the new<br>zealanders it's about a three-way split<br>so a third of them are overseas and are<br>pretty much going to stay overseas and<br>that included david um about a third of<br>them have been overseas would have come<br>back and about a third of them have<br>never been overseas for long-term work<br>or study so they've they've they've<br>stayed in new zealand throughout and the<br>people who came back which are really<br>the target market for some of these<br>questions um leave a lot of money on the<br>table and so they could be earning<br>around about a hundred thousand dollars<br>per year more overseas than they earned<br>in new zealand and so we asked them you<br>know what was it that attracted you back<br>and none of it was things that you and<br>your former role or your credit or your<br>successes could do anything about<br>because it was a chance to have the<br>growing up experience that they<br>experienced connecting with family and<br>so forth now what's happened for two<br>years is all of those things if they're<br>overseas have really been um<br>unavailable to them and indeed again the<br>sudden smugness almost of saying well<br>you deserved it because you went<br>overseas you you betrayed us and so you<br>know this is the basis of the grounded<br>kiwis case and so forth there's really<br>very little that policymakers can do to<br>to attract and alter these flows uh and<br>so i think we've just got to be a lot<br>more realistic about how undesirable in<br>some ways we are and obviously people<br>are going to say oh look at that guy<br>he's just talking us down but it's just<br>the reality of where we are compared<br>with where the rest of the world has<br>moved<br>okay now what about you simon uh on the<br>on the issue of how real is this<br>isolationism and what what policy levers<br>can be pulled to counter not<br>isolationism sorry isolation<br>yeah i mean really interesting i've got<br>kids who are in their mid to late teens<br>and<br>obviously as a parent i'd love to have<br>them still in new zealand they perceive<br>massive opportunities overseas compared<br>to new zealand which of course i i did<br>too and i took advantage of those<br>opportunities but there's another push<br>factor and it harks back to the previous<br>session my kids are utterly convinced<br>that they will never be able to afford a<br>house in this country and the only way<br>that they will be able to afford to own<br>a house will be going abroad<br>and these are a 16 year old and the 18<br>year old<br>so you know even as simple things as<br>getting the housing market right are<br>really important now i'd like to chuck<br>in an anecdote that that in some<br>respects um beefs up john's one i worked<br>for a portion of my academic career on<br>the dunedin child longitudinal study and<br>it it tracks all the children born in<br>the cohort of about a thousand kids at<br>wherever they go around the world<br>and<br>we thought that these people would go<br>overseas in their 20s and then they<br>would bounce back in their late 20s well<br>that didn't happen they stayed overseas<br>the interesting thing however as they<br>got older they relocated and they<br>relocated from the northern hemisphere<br>to the southern hemisphere<br>so you might be working in london and<br>new york but you don't come back to<br>auckland or wellington or dunedin you<br>come back to a major australian city<br>and uh so the other reason that people<br>go overseas is for the amenity value of<br>lots of other concentrated numbers of<br>people around there are the arts there's<br>listening to interesting people uh talk<br>there is the whole big city vibe<br>auckland is an overgrown medium-sized<br>city<br>australia offers you know sydney and<br>melbourne are truly international cities<br>so those are all challenges we as a<br>country have to overcome i think john's<br>right the principal attraction is to get<br>new zealanders back is uh you know the<br>chance to grow up in<br>you know the society and this culture<br>i'm a pessimist on on this one generally<br>speaking i think uh there's probably<br>relatively little we can do<br>as a country to<br>permanently shift our productivity<br>growth rate we can do things that<br>improve our productivity level<br>but i do not see a higher long-term<br>growth rate arising out of anything<br>policy makers in wellington can do<br>okay<br>that's um sobering um i would note too<br>that of course auckland um a city that i<br>live in uh often thinks of itself as<br>pretty big but it's the fifth largest<br>city in australasia and doesn't like to<br>be reminded of that uh because you're<br>making an exactly right point i've got a<br>brother who's just returned to sydney<br>and uh and<br>so many people do exactly that<br>one of the questions from our audience<br>is what would oh here's a chance for you<br>guys to write the policy what do you<br>think giving your<br>comments about the limitations of public<br>policy nevertheless uh politicians have<br>to do things right um so in terms of<br>designing an immigration policy post<br>covert because we are in this rather<br>unique position where it's been stopped<br>and now it gets to start again<br>and obviously in wellington they're<br>talking about pulling the levers they're<br>very excited about the opportunity to<br>construct a new immigration policy so<br>what would you two do<br>and what would be what would be your<br>approach to to attracting that high<br>skilled labor force<br>but also ensuring local school upgrading<br>and you know the comments that simon was<br>making earlier about grow your own as<br>well<br>and i think we can definitely take that<br>as a desirable thing and i know from<br>years as minister of tertiary education<br>that just doubling the number of<br>engineering graduates took a huge amount<br>of heavy lifting<br>but nevertheless there's definitely a<br>need to do that so what would you do<br>let's start with start with simon<br>what would i do well first of all i<br>would get rid of any rights that<br>students have to work in new zealand so<br>if you're coming to new zealand you're<br>not going to be operating in the low<br>school end of the labor market to the<br>detriments of<br>others who operate in that labour market<br>and equally<br>the right to work<br>working holiday visas i think tend to<br>create a dynamic at the bottom of the<br>labor market where we've got 300 000 new<br>zealanders who are plus who are on a<br>welfare benefit which we need to<br>provide as much incentive as possible to<br>get work um we need to think about why<br>it is that we get so many migrants in<br>the middle of the income distribution<br>um and we need to think much harder<br>about exactly who do we want to buy and<br>what what are the the set of skills in<br>new zealand where it is not worth our<br>while spending money educating<br>um people<br>and i'd like to finish stephen by<br>picking up on your politicians to have<br>to do things well no they don't have to<br>do things doing nothing is always an<br>so so<br>again there are limitations here about<br>what politicians<br>can actually do and and sometimes it's<br>worth not pulling on a lever because in<br>fact<br>the negatives overwhelm the positives of<br>of of punting a ball into the dark we've<br>punted a lot of bulls into the dark in<br>new zealand in the last 30 years in<br>search of<br>the chimera which will unlock the<br>treasure trove of productivity and we've<br>been incredibly unsuccessful in<br>unlocking that so maybe there isn't uh<br>that treasure trove out there i was<br>being slightly mischievous in that in<br>that comment but um but nevertheless uh<br>it's interesting because i think you<br>know your comments there sounded quite<br>central planning in terms of you know<br>who we should train and in what areas<br>i mean isn't that the difficulty here uh<br>that it's the individual choice we have<br>to counter we have to cater to<br>and it seems that the reality of for<br>example fruit picking in in in our fruit<br>picking regions is such that<br>unfortunately a lot of young kiwis don't<br>yep that that that that's absolutely<br>true uh they don't and so the question<br>arises is it better that we reallocate<br>the resources that are currently in the<br>fruit industry and put them elsewhere<br>where there may be longer term options<br>for productivity i think<br>there's very much mentality amongst new<br>zealand employers which has only grown<br>in the last decade or so<br>that they have a right to<br>what arthur lewis called unlimited<br>supplies of labor at the going real wage<br>what that does is encourages a<br>employer mindset and a strategy that<br>focuses on replication<br>as opposed to innovation<br>um because there's no induced innovation<br>by saying oh my god it's costing me a<br>lot more to hire workers what are new<br>smart and different ways of doing things<br>as opposed to i've got a business model<br>that works and if it stops working i'll<br>knock on the government store and i'll<br>let more workers in<br>rightly john respond to that thank you<br>simon and also those questions i asked<br>simon as well john so you've got your<br>magic wand um<br>thanks<br>so so i think the first thing that needs<br>to be done is to raise the standard of<br>what counts as a valuation in in<br>wellington but more generally right so<br>so we've got um some migration programs<br>which i think we can make a plausible<br>argument for that they uh enhance our<br>comparative advantage they're sensible<br>things to do they don't necessarily put<br>terribly<br>large resource strain on resources in<br>central cities and i'm thinking<br>particularly of the rsc but what's<br>required to evaluate and make that claim<br>is is far beyond what typically passes<br>for evaluation we think of you know<br>provincial growth fund or all sorts of<br>things and it's just<br>it's frankly terrible right so so the<br>nobel prize in economics in 2021 and<br>2019 both went to what we would call<br>better ways of working out did x cause y<br>well so much of what politicians want to<br>do is first of all they want to play<br>with the x's as as you and simon have<br>pointed out but they would like some<br>evidence that well did x actually cause<br>y okay and and what counts as evidence<br>in new zealand has often been pretty<br>weak and so we need to first raise the<br>standard of that now of course an<br>academic would say that because we think<br>that's going to be more more work for us<br>but once we've done that then we can say<br>okay let's go through all of these<br>various types of migration let's go<br>through student migration let's go<br>through family reunification migration<br>let's go through uh unskilled well lower<br>skilled seasonal work let's go through<br>top talent which one of these seem to be<br>ones which are actually having an impact<br>and which ones don't that would be the<br>basis of building and unfortunately<br>we've gotten to an equilibrium where we<br>really are almost evaluation free uh<br>where you know major major changes are<br>done and and there's some you know<br>um not terribly um rigorous uh x posts<br>well it looks like it improved<br>well-being well well i'm i'm i'm not<br>convinced so yeah<br>can i respond very briefly to that<br>stephen and go and say that i 100 agree<br>with what john's said<br>our the quality of our feedback loops in<br>this country is incredibly poor<br>and that's actually become a theme uh<br>through the day we were discussing this<br>in the business uh session earlier um<br>same sort of discussion about the<br>quality of not in that case the quality<br>of implementation<br>which i think also<br>comes to real question look thank you<br>very much for your time we're out of<br>time uh well i know we've only just<br>scratched the surface but you've<br>certainly stimulated some discussion i<br>hope some of my former colleagues in<br>wellington<br>get a chance to<br>see this session perhaps over the<br>weekend<br>but thank you both very very much indeed<br>and thank you simon for persevering<br>despite the technology challenges<br>and we'll catch up with you both again<br>soon thanks and now we uh go to an<br>another session which uh<br>i think gives us<br>an opportunity look at the slightly<br>broader sweep of of where we sit<br>relative to uh the last<br>40 years anyway<br>by talking to a former prime minister<br>who has seen a lot of things in his time<br>in government<br>jim bulger of course was in government<br>in the 70s 80s and 90s<br>which makes him a much more resilient<br>politician than i ever was<br>and<br>understands that sweep of history and<br>that challenge of change<br>so<br>we are in tumultuous times we are<br>certainly seeing a lot of change right<br>now so i'm pleased to be able to<br>introduce jim<br>thank you for joining us<br>and uh it's great to have you here<br>thank you thank you stephen thank you<br>everybody and good afternoon all sorry<br>we can't meet in person we could have a<br>chat and find the real thinking of<br>people look good beside the government<br>of the reserve bank and see what he's<br>really going to do with interest rates<br>but<br>now we can't do that so it's<br>disappointing we can't get beside<br>everybody but the changes that the<br>pandemic has caused of course to society<br>been touched on by many if not all the<br>speakers today and the implications of<br>those are still to be played out and how<br>we might see them but i want to very<br>warmly congratulate the university<br>for bringing together what i describe as<br>a stellar lineup of speakers i think<br>it's tremendous<br>and i especially acknowledge my former<br>colleague the right honourable helen<br>clark<br>for her i think insightful thoughts on a<br>variety of issues particularly<br>international ones<br>collectively of course very important<br>issues have been raised and discussed<br>and i hope that they will encourage<br>people to seek<br>new or search for new thinking and new<br>ideas<br>as i put it here i don't believe we can<br>continue to rely on adam smith's wealth<br>of nations which was written in 1776<br>for today's problems from a new zealand<br>perspective it's important that this<br>forum continues if i might add plug for<br>the university<br>as an annual on an annual basis a sort<br>of a new zealand davos if you like where<br>ideas can be promoted debated shared<br>discussed<br>as you probably know from the<br>program my the title of my remarks is<br>leading in a changing world<br>my approach to that is to challenge all<br>of us to think carefully but boldly on<br>the leadership our changing world<br>requires now he's talking about changing<br>world if we don't do something about it<br>on the issue of leadership<br>there are two big issues that leaders<br>must face<br>one is a willingness to when necessary<br>to put old ideas aside that's a<br>challenge and display the capacity to<br>embrace new ideas and accept that some<br>earlier decisions you made were now<br>wrong or simply that circumstances have<br>changed<br>and secondly most importantly to have<br>the ability to see as it were a<br>different tomorrow<br>a more just tomorrow we've talked a lot<br>about that more just tomorrow and then<br>the ability to devise determine or<br>detect emerging new options and the<br>courage<br>importantly the courage to accept them<br>big issues like a four-day week or even<br>a universal basic income now that might<br>address some of the social issues we<br>talked about today prepare the public<br>for the impact that artificial<br>intelligence and robots will have on the<br>world of work those in leadership<br>positions and it's always difficult need<br>to talk about the implications of these<br>and how we might respond to them<br>easy to say<br>but with regards to economic policy many<br>are inclined to stay with the tried and<br>true<br>and hope for better results the next<br>time around<br>here albert einstein's definition of<br>insanity is relevant<br>broadly it was repeat the same policy<br>but expect a different result<br>it doesn't work<br>that means if we want different outcomes<br>and every speaker has been in that space<br>what different outcomes tomorrow<br>if we want a more equitable and fair<br>society tomorrow if we want more focus<br>on protecting mother earth<br>then policies have to change that's the<br>bottom line<br>the challenge of change was reflected on<br>by keynes when he observed that quote<br>and the facts change<br>i changed my mind<br>what do you do sir<br>the answer to that question from my<br>experience is that most seek to find a<br>way to avoid whatever the issue is take<br>for example just been touched on the<br>reality that with an aging population<br>new zealand will too will have to slowly<br>raise the age at which people qualify<br>for universal<br>superannuation the oecd raised the issue<br>again in its recent report<br>but again it was just brushed aside<br>every economist and leader at this<br>gathering knows that the age of which<br>people qualify for national<br>superannuation<br>must go up<br>and the sooner we and the government<br>have the courage to say so<br>the more time people<br>have to prepare<br>further it's a given that we need to<br>protect the vulnerable with this change<br>in my term as prime minister we faced<br>the issue and lifted the qualifying age<br>from 60 to 65 over a five-year period<br>and while that was strongly opposed at<br>the time you will have noted that no<br>politician now says it should go back to<br>60 years<br>my point is that to make big difficult<br>changes you need to have done your<br>homework that's essential<br>then you have to have the political<br>courage to front up to your critics and<br>explain to them the need for the change<br>and remember<br>difficult issues don't go away by<br>ignoring them<br>thinking of courage i'm sure that all<br>have watched some of the remarkable<br>athletes demonstrating their incredible<br>skills<br>at the beijing winter olympics just<br>amazing stuff<br>but you may have also been fortunate<br>enough to see on the screen another<br>woman of courage named finna cooper<br>holding the hand of a young child as she<br>started a decoy from the far north to<br>parliament<br>so little history to start<br>yes it has relevance to the issue of<br>change<br>the late dane finna commenced her long<br>march in late 1975 to deliver a petition<br>to parliament on historic grievances<br>regarding the alienation of maori land<br>she addressed her remarks to the then<br>prime minister bill rowling and all<br>members of parliament<br>the petition which is framed and hangs<br>in a prominent position in our home our<br>home is dated the 13th of october 1975<br>and states in its opening<br>quote greetings to you in whose assembly<br>is vested all the powers to amend and<br>adjust all laws which inflict injustice<br>and hardship of the maori people and in<br>whom is vested the power to confirm all<br>promises which are made to give relief<br>to the indigenous people of new zealand<br>under her majesty's magna carta long<br>lived the queen<br>quote in a quote the petition then<br>advanced some key issues that should be<br>addressed<br>a few and a few weeks later of course<br>the november 75 election was held and<br>saw a return of the national party and a<br>different prime minister rob mulder<br>and i was appointed the parliamentary<br>under secretary to the minister of<br>agriculture and the minister of maori<br>affairs the right honourable duncan<br>mcintyre<br>in that position i became chair of the<br>maori affair select committee and as<br>chair of the committee i had agreed to<br>hold a meeting to hear damn phoenix<br>petition in auckland<br>i must add that petition had over 200<br>additional signatures as well as named<br>phoenix<br>we on the committee heard passionate<br>submissions outlining the many<br>grievances that in common justice had to<br>be addressed<br>now let me move forward fifteen years to<br>1990 when i became prime minister and<br>drawing on the developments of those<br>years and reflecting on dan finner's<br>petition petition<br>i decided that the honor of the country<br>demanded that we must do better<br>with the support of other ministers but<br>especially sir douglas graham then<br>minister of trading negotiations we<br>started a new approach that new approach<br>was clearly going to cost much more and<br>the treasury suggested an additional 250<br>million<br>but they clearly would have been<br>inadequate so i put forward 1 billion<br>dollars<br>yes a huge sum in those days but already<br>the cost is over 2 billion and much more<br>to come<br>from my perspective a relatively small<br>amount to help bring honor to new<br>zealand and help create the huge and<br>growing maori economy of which we heard<br>a little about earlier today i was<br>pleased to hear it<br>a few days back<br>the euro we're aboard<br>which i remember held its regular<br>meeting<br>and thinking back to my title leading in<br>a changing world<br>you may recall how seven years back the<br>then minister of treaty negotiation the<br>honorable chris finlayson<br>and tuhoy agreed to a totally new and<br>bold approach<br>to certainly naitah's treaty claims i<br>was involved in the last meetings<br>instead of long and divisive<br>negotiations on who owned the euro eras<br>the crown and two boy agreed to a<br>totally new approach<br>that the euro areas own itself<br>the land which endures forever<br>owns itself<br>and we who live but a short while<br>have a duty to care for the land<br>that the euro era board has the<br>responsibility to speak in law to speak<br>for the land and care for the land<br>that new approach has now been picked up<br>by other countries like canada and india<br>now the hard part<br>they're not getting weight easy<br>hard passing the challenge to senior<br>economic thinkers<br>looking out at the gross inequality<br>spoken about often today<br>the inequality across new zealand and<br>the world<br>can you suggest<br>an equally bold new approach<br>as we did in treaty settlements<br>surely<br>no one is going to suggest just tinker<br>with the present model<br>with hunger and climate crisis advancing<br>almost everywhere<br>for example<br>the whole back hunger in new zealand<br>in 2022 we distribute more and more food<br>parcels<br>we don't talk much about that when<br>talking of a team of five million or<br>when talking about the strength of the<br>economy<br>and we don't talk about how daily more<br>families can't afford a home that's been<br>touched on<br>and about 10 000 are in emergency<br>housing costing<br>350 million<br>when i went<br>on the q a program on tv one a few weeks<br>back discussing the characteristics i<br>would look for in a leader<br>i drew on professor rebecca henderson of<br>harvard's<br>new book titled reimagining capitalism<br>in a world on fire<br>i encourage you all to read it<br>as she dissects much that she sees as<br>wrong with the current economic model<br>model you don't have to agree with all<br>of it but looking around new zealand and<br>the world we do need<br>we do need to reimagine capitalism<br>i won't try and cover all the points<br>made in the book i won't do that at all<br>i'll just instead quote a little from<br>the back page<br>back cover<br>reimagining it said<br>reimagining capitalism in a world on<br>fire is the definitive book about the<br>make or break point now facing business<br>the capitalist system as we know it is<br>doomed unless we can really fix climate<br>change raise wages remake our politics<br>and take meaningful action about the<br>issues of inequality and structural<br>racism we've touched on those today<br>it goes on reimagining capitalism<br>requires balancing the enormous power of<br>the free market<br>with the power of democratic accountable<br>government and strong civil society in<br>the quote<br>but to back it up i'll give you a stark<br>example from the book rate based on u.s<br>statistics unfortunately i couldn't find<br>comparable ones for new zealand<br>but these are stark<br>between 1946 and 1980<br>us total pre-tax income nearly doubled<br>the poorest half of the population saw<br>their income increased slightly more<br>than it's yeah slightly more than double<br>well the richest 10<br>saw slightly smaller increase<br>then going forward and this is the<br>crucial bit that we're dealing with<br>today going forward between 1980 and<br>2014<br>pre-tax national income grew by 61<br>but the income of the poorest half grew<br>by only 1<br>while the income of the top 10<br>grew by 121<br>just reflect on that for a moment when<br>we were talking about inequality earlier<br>and the income of the top 1 of course<br>more than tripled<br>if you want a more just a more equitable<br>world we have much work to do<br>so where to next<br>going forward we could hopefully agree<br>that the environment is a common good<br>belonging to all and meant for all so we<br>should treat it accordingly<br>can we also agree<br>on the principle in principle<br>with the goal of meeting the needs of<br>all<br>rather than the unlimited wants greed<br>of the few<br>if you sign up to those two points<br>you are signing up to a big change in<br>how we measure progress<br>i believe such a change is needed and<br>agree with the economist and thinker<br>professor jeffrey sachs who put it this<br>way<br>quote our greatest illusion is that a<br>healthy society can be organized by the<br>single-minded pursuit of wealth<br>close quote<br>today the almost universal measure of<br>success<br>is economic growth is measured by gdp<br>gross domestic product<br>in the context of this discussion<br>to really measure societal progress we<br>must develop must develop a more<br>inclusive index that not only measures<br>money transactions but also important<br>personal and community issues such as<br>health education all touched on housing<br>of course pollution and broader<br>environmental issues to replace gdp as a<br>measure of progress<br>dr marilyn waring a doctoral graduate of<br>this university is one of those who has<br>written extensively on this issue and i<br>invite thought leaders here today and<br>elsewhere to engage with her because we<br>mustn't just talk about these issues we<br>must develop policies to address them<br>that's the important part going forward<br>developing new policies and please don't<br>say it's too hard<br>think of the changes we have accepted in<br>our lives in response to the covert<br>pandemic we've agreed to isolate<br>ourselves for long stretches we have<br>worked attended meetings and had deeply<br>personal conversations talking to our<br>computers or laptops<br>we have taken online courses and seen<br>doctors and therapists using<br>telemedicine<br>people previously ignored are now<br>designated as essential workers but<br>unfortunately are often still on a very<br>modest income<br>but a little bit of courage and that's<br>simple to resolve i could go on<br>but back to the beginning<br>the issue is to find the political will<br>in the public world to accept big policy<br>shifts so let me conclude<br>this is not a call to overthrow<br>capitalism but a call to use the energy<br>and drive of individual initiative and<br>open markets to create new opportunities<br>but having done that to change the<br>discussion from only individual<br>advancement<br>to community advancement<br>leading in a changing world requires we<br>move past economic slogans or slogan<br>economics and slick pr through to<br>carefully thought out policies that<br>address real community concerns<br>and important<br>listen carefully<br>and sadly there are very<br>many unhappy people across new zealand<br>today<br>don't just dismiss them as losers or nut<br>cases yes some maybe<br>but as a society we need to hear and<br>respond to legitimate concerns<br>this could as others have said be a very<br>challenging issue<br>if the world economy was to move into<br>recession as a result of the russian<br>i leave it there<br>thank you for your attention i'm happy<br>to accept your questions<br>thank you very much jim that was a very<br>thought provoking and<br>appropriately challenging<br>uh set of comments so thank you very<br>much indeed<br>i'm<br>happy to have questions we've got one or<br>two on the on the question machine<br>so please please pass them in i'm going<br>to ask jim a couple of things to start<br>us off uh we've got about 10 minutes to<br>go<br>jim<br>in terms of your own experience in<br>politics<br>yeah we're going through obviously a<br>quite dramatic period of change brought<br>on by the pandemic first time in 100<br>years<br>we all know about the challenges of<br>russia's<br>approach to the ukraine<br>and the world has to some degree been<br>tipped up uh over the last two years<br>from what was a reasonably settled uh<br>period prior to that or at least back to<br>the gfc<br>but<br>in terms of your experiences and your<br>understanding of political history how<br>do you think this period rates as over<br>the last say uh last 100 years<br>or at least back to the 70s i mean we<br>are we dealing with the sort of changes<br>that we were dealing<br>when britain joined the eu and and so on<br>which was you know really tipped up new<br>zealand society<br>what do you think where do you think we<br>sit in this current period in terms of<br>the dramatic nature of the change or are<br>we dealing with a passing phenomenon<br>i don't think it's passing i think it's<br>uh<br>permanent and the change will be<br>permanent<br>and uh<br>and that's why i touched on things like<br>a four-day working week and uh even the<br>universal basic income i think there are<br>big big issues coming down<br>and i would like to see society<br>discussing them i'd like our leaders to<br>be discussing them<br>even if they want to dismiss them i<br>think you can't just brush them out but<br>i think if you go right back<br>to the 30s depression which uh some of<br>us<br>don't remember but we know of from<br>parents talking about them<br>um<br>the the challenge is in that scale i<br>think to face an entirely different<br>world and why that's important and why<br>it fits into my remarks steven is that<br>at that stage after that there was a<br>radical change in economic thinking and<br>economic policy the difference between<br>the response of the government today and<br>the response of the government in the<br>30s is stark in the 30s they still tried<br>to balance the books<br>there was front and center of the<br>finance minister of new zealand's goals<br>at that stage it was a disaster<br>this time<br>the finance minister almost seems to<br>have had a policy to print more money<br>you know we've increased our debt<br>dramatically to take new zealand through<br>this period so i think we have<br>approached it quite differently we need<br>to<br>but we are still not focusing on<br>approaching the change that technology<br>is going to pick up and move forward<br>afterwards after the pandemic<br>you mentioned superannuation<br>and i think we both speak as people who<br>at least tried to<br>adjust the super age unfortunately in my<br>case in 2017 winston had other ideas<br>um<br>but um<br>but<br>is there room now do you think for a<br>consensus on on some of these things<br>unfortunately the default position of<br>governments seems to be<br>you know let's not scare the horses<br>let's not make the chain let's<br>kick the can down the road<br>but i suppose with a pandemic you can<br>argue don't waste a good crisis if you<br>need to actually make some of these<br>changes you should get on with it and<br>that's the old winston churchill quote<br>isn't it<br>absolutely i should get on with it<br>clearly as i said you know deferring big<br>decisions doesn't make them go away and<br>this decision only gets worse people<br>need to know what's certainly one of the<br>challenges that we know people are<br>uncertain in today's world one of the<br>challenges is to bring back certainty<br>you need to managing change big change<br>is go from a period of certainty a<br>position sorry of certainty then move<br>quickly through the uncertain page<br>and place to certainty again quick as<br>possible don't leave people<br>pondering the uncertainty<br>give them the facts tell them what's<br>going to happen and move there and don't<br>waffle around<br>that's a very good point because you<br>touched on<br>the disaffected through covert<br>and the most visible group is the people<br>camped outside parliament<br>but we don't have to walk very far in<br>life to hear other people now who are<br>also disaffected and have had their<br>lives turned up<br>and i think of the time in history um<br>with<br>longing government and the end of smps<br>and so on where you know there was a<br>probably a similar<br>you know where people had been doing the<br>right thing they've been doing the<br>things the government told them to do<br>and then suddenly it all changed on them<br>and that feels a bit like that today for<br>some of these industries<br>uh so so what's your message there<br>because they would sit and say gosh not<br>more change<br>yeah we need some return to normality<br>well they need to go to a new normality<br>they have to move from the position of<br>stability they had before the pandemic<br>to the new position of stability as<br>quickly as possible that means<br>government policies have to be made<br>quickly firmly and clear so people know<br>where they're going to be and we must<br>move away from just leaving it all<br>floating in the air and because that's<br>what kills people metaphorically i mean<br>the uncertainty of not knowing what<br>tomorrow brings try and remove the<br>uncertainty and give people certainty<br>what people want to know is certainty in<br>their lives that's been one of the<br>debates through the pandemic with a lot<br>of people arguing for more certainty<br>from the government<br>you know when will this happen when will<br>that happen and then supporters of the<br>government coming back and saying well<br>we don't know so you know the prime<br>minister's right to say we don't know<br>but what you're saying is i i'm<br>detecting anyway and you you correct me<br>is that you're better to say something<br>definitive anyway almost as definitive<br>as you can be<br>i think but most of these issues we<br>could be definite upon i mean i think<br>while the pandemic is uh<br>untamed if that's the word<br>um the<br>uncertainty was unnecessary in some<br>spaces i mean the uncertainty about<br>instant testing has been unnecessary i<br>mean we could have made that decision a<br>long time ago we could have made the<br>decision that we had the testing kits in<br>new zealand now not still just waiting<br>for them they'll be here tomorrow maybe<br>the next day or the day after or the<br>week after<br>there are things you can do if that's<br>your ambition to get certainty and i<br>think we need to do more of that but we<br>need to do more of it across the economy<br>too i mean it'll be foolish to pretend<br>that this<br>pandemic is just going to have an impact<br>and then vanish<br>we started today or yesterday with<br>deciding the rise of interest rates well<br>i through my political career live<br>through very very very high interest<br>rates and now all about very very high<br>inflation rates and if anybody believes<br>and i'd like some of the economists to<br>respond i know we can't in this form but<br>um anybody believes that the inflation<br>just going to go up and then vanish i'd<br>invite them to read history because<br>that's not what's going to happen that's<br>unfortunate it's worse than unfortunate<br>but that's what we're going to now<br>struggle with for a few years to get<br>inflation back down to the levels we<br>want which is three percent up to a<br>maximum of three percent in the reserve<br>bank act so i<br>think we're in for a challenging<br>transition<br>and the clearer we can give advice to<br>the public as to what's going to happen<br>the more stable society will be<br>thank you<br>two quick questions to finish uh from<br>the from the viewers<br>firstly uh one of them says beyond gdp<br>and welfare<br>sorry well-being economics<br>the the economics of well-being and and<br>and the term beyond gpdp has been around<br>now for about 20 years and it's been<br>promoted by organizations such as the<br>oecd<br>why do you think it hasn't had more<br>traction in the last 20 years<br>when it's obviously something you feel<br>quite strongly about as well<br>because it's more complex and people<br>like the simplicity of gdp<br>it's same in black and white<br>metaphorically stephen you can just<br>count it and measure it and add but i've<br>often used the example the extraordinary<br>tragedy of the terrorist attack in the<br>christchurch mosques that added to gdp<br>the help that society gave to those<br>distraught communities<br>added nothing<br>in the terms of measuring gdp<br>and the starkness of those two positions<br>i think should persuade more new<br>zealanders that we need a different<br>measure and i just go back i visited the<br>remote himalayan kingdom of bhutan once<br>a few years back and in that remote<br>kingdom in the mountains beautiful place<br>on a sunny day wouldn't be that good in<br>winter and<br>they introduced a global happiness index<br>yes challenging complex to contemplate<br>how you measure that but they are moving<br>forward on it and i wish them well<br>and finally<br>a very<br>a topic that sort of<br>casts a shadow on this gathering and<br>around the world of course is<br>ukraine and russia<br>questioner has asked from your<br>experience in washington<br>of course you were ambassador there for<br>our country for a period of time<br>what advice would you give president<br>biden now if you had the opportunity<br>regarding russia in the ukraine<br>first of all he has to be firm<br>from my perspective<br>and it's only my perspective and there's<br>many writing on this<br>uh president putin has decided there is<br>a weakness in the western position<br>he has very cleverly<br>orchestrated the move i don't think it<br>was going back when he<br>assisted those two provinces to break<br>away from ukraine proper but he now has<br>a<br>sort of an explainable cause he's going<br>in to help true independent republics<br>he will already or has already started<br>to say that threatened by ukraine and<br>therefore he has to send in troops to<br>protect them<br>the tragic reminder this is telling you<br>and me<br>is when hitler invaded the student land<br>in czechoslovakia as an excuse to start<br>world war ii<br>and he had the same reason that the<br>student people were mainly german<br>speakers just as the ones in the two<br>breakaway provinces are mainly russian<br>speakers in fact they're all russian<br>speakers through there but so we're<br>seeing history sadly<br>has appearances of repeating hopefully<br>the power of the<br>his persuasive power and the solidarity<br>of the western country who demonstrably<br>collectively much stronger<br>than russia will persuade putin that the<br>ultimate folly he could do is to try and<br>start a proper war but<br>god willing that's what happened but at<br>the moment we're in a very unstable<br>position and that unstability<br>instability is going to impact on new<br>zealand whether it's through economics<br>or through societal value so it's a<br>tough time stephen yep<br>thank you jim um and i concur with your<br>worries about um the echoes of history<br>in that regard<br>look thank you very very much for your<br>time this afternoon uh very much<br>appreciated it<br>uh and i think the challenge you've<br>given is one that this forum is up up<br>for in terms of becoming a place to<br>share ideas and challenge ourselves to<br>examine new ideas which is the whole<br>point if you can't do it in a forum like<br>this then then where can you do it so<br>thank you very much<br>that's why i brought in that huge change<br>we made in the treaty settlements<br>we moved from trying to spend endless<br>times determining whose land it was<br>and took it totally new and bold<br>approach<br>and i think in economic thinking and<br>i've listened to the whole of today's<br>presentation it has been very very good<br>i'm still waiting to see the new<br>thinking<br>most of it was repeating thinking i've<br>heard for many many years i really<br>encourage people to try and think a<br>different framework<br>thank you very much<br>everybody<br>uh thank you for joining us<br>well there we go the end of a a really<br>good day and um somebody looks vaguely<br>vaguely similar to german sitting next<br>to me now that's right you can imagine<br>what easter's gonna be like in in my<br>household it might sound a little bit<br>like the last uh half hour um i was<br>gonna ask you a question stephen we've<br>had an enormous day uh thank you to all<br>those that have been with us<br>uh and zoom thanks to all of the<br>presenters<br>you're sitting in a unique position here<br>you're obviously still engaged in the<br>world of business the world and policy a<br>policy you've been in the hot seat in<br>government through a tumultuous time<br>yourself what have you picked up is the<br>biggest themes when you connect you know<br>it's starting with currently this<br>morning from treasury right through uh<br>we've had uh helen clark and jim bulger<br>from different sides of the house both<br>have had roles within new zealand and<br>globally<br>and a whole bunch of other topics in<br>between what have been the big themes<br>you've picked up<br>well obviously the rate of change is<br>going on right now and<br>actually all our speakers in various<br>ways are grappling with that change in<br>their own thinking as well as as as<br>as as what other people are going<br>through<br>um i think that's a that's a big part of<br>it um<br>i think what was fascinating a bit for<br>me were some themes that i didn't expect<br>necessarily<br>although i think they are enduring<br>themes and one is the quality of policy<br>development and implementation in this<br>country and evaluation<br>we do tend to and partly it's the joy of<br>being small right so we do tend to go<br>let's just do that and you get a bunch<br>of people in the corridor lounge they<br>talk to the minister and suddenly it's a<br>good idea and away we go so<br>i not so much the corrie lounge lately<br>of course but um<br>but uh so so i think um you know there's<br>some big changes coming and we need to<br>make sure they're in the right direction<br>because i agree with jim there needs to<br>be change<br>but um you know<br>there is there needs to be there needs<br>to be change that we understand why<br>we're making the change and what what<br>we're doing so if you look at<br>you know the discussions around<br>productivity it's fascinating got two<br>people on probably on opposite sides of<br>the debate simon chapel and john gibson<br>both asking the question<br>you know are we really trying to create<br>a rod for our own backs with these with<br>this this challenge and productivity<br>and maybe we have to measure things a<br>slightly different way in this country<br>well that you know a few years ago was<br>political heresy i mean<br>uh politicians have always been beaten<br>around the ears about productivity uh<br>levels as measured uh by stats<br>departments and censuses and so on so<br>that's a significant one<br>i think<br>i think that's discussions around<br>the health sector<br>you know there's some real challenges<br>there to uh current uh health minister<br>and the ministry of health which let's<br>face it the ministry of health hasn't<br>covered itself in glory lately<br>and<br>the the ministry<br>you know is making some changes<br>and unfortunately all three members of a<br>panel we didn't get dez gorman in the<br>end but uh he and i had a preliminary<br>discussion all three members of the<br>panel<br>were of the view that the changes that<br>were being you know that are hugely<br>expensive a lot of change we're<br>effectively just changing the<br>bureaucracy at the top again to make us<br>feel good about what might happen but<br>doesn't actually change anything in<br>terms of<br>patient-centered care in terms of<br>putting the care in the right places i<br>mean that's a big red flag for the<br>government if you because these are<br>these are people with different views<br>they're not all on one side of the<br>spectrum or other so there's some<br>significant sectoral stuff<br>we heard from the business sector the<br>maori economy some of the challenges<br>that they're going through and i think<br>you've got to listen to those people<br>because they need to have a<br>an understanding of where we're going<br>which was the point that jim picked up<br>which is you know people don't well<br>people do mind change but people cope<br>with change better if they know where<br>we're going uh and there's some<br>some debate about that so and over<br>across the top of the whole thing uh is<br>is you know these big macro economic<br>issues inflation<br>uh fiscal policy debt um you could add<br>housing into that as a theme that's run<br>through the day<br>and so that leads us nicely into<br>tomorrow i think because that's when we<br>hit some of those big macro economic<br>issues yes yeah the uh the agenda<br>turns out to to work i<br>reflecting on what you said something<br>that struck me today<br>if you read through the the program<br>looked at the issues that you've just<br>touched on look at tomorrow monetary<br>fiscal<br>policy geopolitical housing issues<br>each one of these could be unpacked into<br>a two-day conference there is so much<br>going on so i was also struck by the<br>comment there at the end when we're<br>talking about productivity and labor and<br>both john and simon made the points<br>about measurement<br>there are so many reforms in play and if<br>you then listen to jim bulger now<br>talking about the need for bolder<br>thinking a huge challenge in this is<br>landing things is execution and as the<br>analysis right where we started with uh<br>treasury and currently this morning is<br>actually seeing how these things<br>interrelate because you'd have to say<br>listening today listening to today<br>there's a high risk of unintended<br>consequences playing out just because<br>there are so many moving pieces at the<br>time where you've got exogenous shocks<br>well i was quite troubled uh actually<br>and i thought brian chappell spoke very<br>well but when i learned that you know<br>treasury doesn't have an overarching<br>um sort of unit devoted to assessing all<br>these labour market reforms at this<br>point in time<br>and i'm thinking well you know there's<br>there's a lot going on we've got new<br>immigration policies we've got the fair<br>pay agreements we've got the big<br>increases in minimum wage we've got the<br>social insurance<br>and i know how government works i mean<br>every every policy group that comes up<br>with these policies they do their own<br>analysis<br>which is fine<br>um sometimes needs improvement but<br>nevertheless it you know there's some<br>good policy that comes out but you do<br>need to be when you're doing a lot of<br>stuff at once you do need to look over<br>it<br>and have somebody going and this is<br>treasury's ideal role is to is to be<br>saying right let's look at this in tota<br>and in totality now where is this<br>heading and being prepared to stand up<br>and say<br>well we're either in favor of it and<br>these are the reasons or we're concerned<br>about it<br>um yeah it's gonna it's a fascinating<br>time uh<br>look we will wrap up for today we've had<br>fantastic discussion again a huge thanks<br>to everybody that's joined us online and<br>particularly to our presentation uh<br>presenters and moderators for the day<br>thank you stephen for joining us we will<br>be back tomorrow so again a big day we<br>will start at 8 40 tomorrow morning<br>brief recap and then straight into it<br>with reserve bank governor adrian orr<br>followed by a panel discussion around<br>monetary policy a very strong panel<br>around fiscal policy and then<br>if you're looking for more more protein<br>in the meal we've got a session on<br>housing and we'll wrap up before lunch<br>with a session on geopolitics and we're<br>in a stage where<br>we don't know what the geopolitical<br>situation will be like by tomorrow<br>lunchtime and so<br>fascinating times challenging times<br>these are some pretty weighty topics<br>it's been very good discussion today and<br>we look forward to seeing you all<br>tomorrow thanks all and<br>until tomorrow<br>campus the university of waikato is<br>building an innovative and versatile new<br>facility<br>designed to transform the
