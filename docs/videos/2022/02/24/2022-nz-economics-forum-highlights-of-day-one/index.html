from today or<br>some of them well there was many<br>highlights um and and actually as it was<br>a really big day and lots to think about<br>i think the health forum for me was a<br>highlight uh<br>we were one speaker down but um we we<br>did find<br>some real concerns about the health<br>reforms which<br>uh uh something i think for everybody to<br>chew on a bit<br>because they came from people who are<br>across the<br>different perspectives on the health<br>sector<br>uh and some some real ongoing challenges<br>with uh with the covert uh response<br>which we've known about from the media<br>but we heard firsthand um today so that<br>was one significant session that uh<br>stood out for me the business<br>environment session also uh we had three<br>very different perspectives we had the<br>the ctu we had uh business new zealand<br>in the form of the sustainable business<br>council and of course treasury as well<br>and<br>it we came away from that i think with<br>the sense that there was lots more work<br>to do around both the evaluation of<br>policy options uh and the and the<br>execution of of of policy that affects<br>business i think all three of our<br>speakers uh you know in their own way<br>and in their in the way they describe it<br>they were all that was where they were<br>all about so those were two particular<br>sessions but uh you had a number of<br>sessions that you might write it as well<br>yeah i<br>had a fantastic session with helen clark<br>you know lucky to have some time with<br>her so she's of course bringing a really<br>unique perspective not just as a former<br>leader of new zealand um former leader<br>of the enormous united nations<br>development program but also having<br>coach co-chaired the independent panel<br>on pandemic preparedness and response<br>hearing her first-hand account of<br>looking at that analysis of how the<br>world responded in the early days of the<br>pandemic<br>and the missteps that we made back and<br>then back in january and february 2020<br>really striking about all of the things<br>that have followed from that and what we<br>could have done differently and i think<br>concerning in that<br>when she described what we might have to<br>do differently and consider this in the<br>context of what's happening<br>geopolitically we'll hear more about<br>that tomorrow but every hour we're<br>seeing more developments in the ukraine<br>the ability of international<br>organizations to coordinate<br>i admit hearing her you know it raised<br>some questions about how well some of<br>those institutions can act in times of<br>crisis<br>well we're dealing with um<br>issues across borders uh and and as the<br>world gets more integrated you know<br>these things require more international<br>cooperation and coordination so whether<br>it's a pandemic uh whether it's climate<br>change uh all these things that you know<br>it's it's getting harder and harder and<br>i think she made the point of<br>uh acting alone is more difficult in the<br>in the modern world so i thought it was<br>fascinating yeah completely<br>closer to home really enjoyed the<br>session on the maori economy uh some<br>great insights there from liz tiamo<br>i mean this is a huge sector more than<br>60 billion dollars in assets now it's<br>grown so fast and looking at<br>the future there are some questions<br>there about whether the term the maori<br>economy will even make sense in 10 20 50<br>years time because of the integration of<br>aotearoa inc new zealand inc<br>but also<br>strong encouragement for all businesses<br>all organizations in new zealand to<br>engage heavily with tao maori i thought<br>that was fantastic i also really enjoyed<br>the education sector<br>listening to the questions coming<br>through there's a lot of concern about<br>this generation of covert kids what's<br>going to happen uh there was you know<br>from the educationalists on the panel<br>the notion that we should just move<br>everything online yeah strong belief and<br>it's not backed by research that's<br>that's not going to work we<br>the importance of human connection is so<br>fundamental to how we learn and of<br>course as the generations coming through<br>now<br>we're going to have to front and address<br>a lot of the other issues that we're<br>facing<br>i i don't think there's any doubt that<br>the the lack of social interaction<br>has been damaging for many um school age<br>kids at this point the question is how<br>damaging and of course is something<br>we're going to find out the next year or<br>two and hopefully not too much<br>i just want to do a shout out too for<br>jim bulger<br>fantastic session at the end there<br>where he really challenged the whole<br>forum in a couple of ways actually he<br>challenges to keep meeting um and<br>i think he rightly identified that this<br>forum provides a real opportunity uh to<br>to bring out new ideas but then also<br>challenge people to come up with more<br>new ideas<br>and it's it's it's great to see somebody<br>uh with with jim's history and politics<br>to actually demand of today's thinkers<br>to come up with more ideas and test more<br>ideas and really that's what we'll be<br>looking to do tomorrow um with the with<br>the remainder of the<br>of the forum we've got some big issues<br>to address tomorrow oh huge now you<br>facilitated a session at the end around<br>productivity immigration labor<br>big themes around there that<br>i guess they spanned a lot of our other<br>topics particularly around how we how<br>the mechanics of government policy<br>setting works interested in your views<br>on that from from a former practitioner<br>yeah well it's it's it's slightly<br>worrying uh and i think<br>quite a few of our uh panelists today<br>from both sides of the political<br>spectrum were a bit concerned uh<br>about<br>some of the way in which policy is<br>developed and i don't think it's a<br>i don't think it's a criticism just of<br>the current government i think<br>the previous government which i was part<br>of would have to put our hands up and<br>say you know not all of it was perfect<br>by any manner of means<br>and<br>you know one of the great things about<br>this country in many ways is<br>as we like to think of things and get<br>things done which can be a real<br>advantage in some situations but i think<br>in policymaking<br>it can be a real disadvantage because<br>the unintended consequences of policy<br>making that goes wrong<br>can be<br>quite far-reaching<br>and and there seems to be<br>a lot done on the fly in the last couple<br>of years and perhaps not had the even<br>the normal level of scrutiny and to be<br>fair to the politicians not the normal<br>level of media scrutiny because when<br>you've got 24 7 covet coverage it's very<br>hard to analyze policy and to really get<br>the public debate going on individual<br>policies besides covert i worry that<br>we're that we may<br>reap a bit of that over the next few<br>years because we haven't had the sort of<br>mental space as a country to really uh<br>pulled a bit some of these policy ideas<br>i think it's a excellent point might<br>add the state of the media to a future<br>forum because i think it influences<br>everything else we're talking about we<br>started the day of course with dr<br>carolee mclesh from treasury really<br>interesting stats on a relative debt<br>position compared to the 90s when some<br>of the legislation we work with now<br>concepts of prudent debt and prudent<br>investment were introduced<br>some some comfort there that we are in a<br>much stronger fiscal position in terms<br>of government debt and certainly the<br>cost of servicing it with current<br>interest rates so i took some comfort<br>out of that<br>that's you know you can read um read<br>many headlines on any side of the<br>political spectrum<br>but i thought that was positive to see<br>and great to see treasury highly engaged<br>in the forum as well yes i think that's<br>good this year<br>we've seen a greater engagement from<br>treasury<br>and and i think long may that last i<br>think because you need the current uh<br>policy analyst policy developers<br>interacting with the academics that's<br>the whole idea of this forum so<br>good to see absolutely now tomorrow a<br>huge day we are kicking off with<br>adriano the governor of the reserve bank<br>followed interestingly by a panel of<br>experts uh new zealand and international<br>on monetary policy<br>that's right the challenging friends<br>challenging friends challenging friends<br>so your take and then on a fiscal policy<br>uh housing and globalization i mean it's<br>uh any one of them is worth hours of<br>discussion but your take on tomorrow<br>well i think we'll bubble up some themes<br>that have been talked about today<br>inflation's come up a lot<br>uh<br>uh the um<br>you know the new zealand uh workforce<br>policies uh the labour market has come<br>up a lot i think that'll come through<br>again tomorrow housing's come up a lot<br>yeah and an inequality so<br>these are these are strong and emerging<br>themes uh climate change sits there as<br>well uh and we had us you know quite a<br>lot of focus on that in the business<br>environment uh session today and i think<br>if you look at it from a microeconomic<br>perspective it's quite clear that<br>resource management climate change<br>environment is is a big complex<br>theme and then there's the labor market<br>which is also a complex theme including<br>immigration but then you've got the<br>overlay of<br>of macroeconomic policy uh particularly<br>you know the settings of interest rates<br>what's happening with inflation uh and<br>how uh i think one of the things we'll<br>be discussing tomorrow is<br>that that monetary policy needs friends<br>so notwithstanding um carrie mcleish's<br>uh session today where she said you know<br>debt was okay<br>um the question that really does become<br>is do you is do you help out this this<br>this very difficult landing uh that the<br>reserve bank is trying to pull off as is<br>central banks around the world i think<br>you're exactly right and that that<br>metaphor you know there's a lot of<br>planes in the air in terms of policy<br>reforms that have been kicked off<br>there's<br>huge amounts going on structurally<br>across the country<br>and a big theme i took out of today and<br>interested in tomorrow<br>is the rigor of the analysis the rigor<br>of the policy making and taking that<br>holistic view about how all these<br>different moving pieces work because<br>we're going to have to land these things<br>in sequence they're all interrelated<br>we've heard all of the themes<br>weaving together today so a challenging<br>time a challenging time for the world<br>challenging time for policy makers and<br>an excellent time to bring together some<br>leading thinkers to debate these issues<br>so thank you for your time today stephen<br>really enjoyed it and looking forward to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
