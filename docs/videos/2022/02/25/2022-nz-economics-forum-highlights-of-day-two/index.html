russian<br>invasion of ukraine um but we touched on<br>some huge topics started the day with uh<br>reserve bank governor adrian orr and<br>then of course you know hard acts follow<br>but then immediately the the panel of<br>experts on monetary policy what was your<br>take well what surprised me perhaps a<br>little bit was the contrast between<br>adrian and the three panelists they<br>obviously seemed to have a pretty<br>different view of the world adrian was<br>very reassuring which is great<br>the other three were more worried<br>and not just about the rbnz but more<br>about the world economic situation and<br>the challenges that central banks are<br>going to have<br>landing this inflationary plane on the<br>aircraft carrier was was the metaphor<br>that was was uh discussed and<br>you know there's there's a lot to be uh<br>uh can probably concerned about in in a<br>world that has almost forgotten what<br>inflation is all about and is there's<br>fast playing catch up in terms of in<br>terms of the impacts of inflation<br>particularly on lower income<br>people<br>and but also more broadly so<br>that was a a sobering discussion<br>through the morning um and um and i<br>think it's something we're gonna be<br>talking about a lot you know for over<br>much of this year yeah monetary policy<br>is uh<br>certainly in the in the mainstream media<br>we we went from that into fiscal policy<br>and again a really strong panel<br>something that struck me in that it's a<br>theme over the last two days<br>is the trade-offs that the government is<br>facing and the sheer complexity coming<br>at the government policy makers<br>regulators<br>really drives the need for<br>uh rigorous analysis i think<br>frank scrimmage said this morning it's<br>it's soft hearts with uh hard heads<br>we really need that and<br>a theme that had come through yesterday<br>is bold ideas to be prepared for the<br>shocks that are happening but gosh think<br>them through there are so many pieces of<br>action in play here that came through in<br>fiscal and then of course we came to the<br>perennial kiwi economic favorite of<br>housing uh interesting topics your view<br>well i think a lot of the arguments<br>we've heard before uh and and i think<br>uh there's been progress made over the<br>last decade i i think<br>one of the challenges we've got now is<br>this still doesn't seem to be consensus<br>at the moment as to what exactly is<br>causing what's going on right now and i<br>think<br>it's quite apparent that interest rates<br>are a much bigger driver or have been<br>ultra low interest rates have been a<br>much bigger driver recently of house<br>prices anyway<br>so uh it was it was a great discussion<br>we had some interesting ideas it was<br>interesting to see dominic stevens in<br>his new role promoting capital gains<br>taxes again it'll be interesting to see<br>whether he's<br>you know it gets anywhere with that<br>given given where the current government<br>has gone on the inside now he's on the<br>inside<br>but<br>i think<br>yeah acknowledgement of progress being<br>made but significantly more to do<br>i wonder though whether again it's going<br>to be slightly overshadowed with some of<br>these other issues this year<br>and particularly if house prices start<br>to<br>soften the way<br>it seems that certainly the<br>macroeconomic economists including the<br>reserve bank governor<br>see it as happening<br>and then of course<br>we finished with the panel on<br>globalization i mean if we thought that<br>the discussion or monetary policy was<br>sobering<br>i talked to the globalization panel<br>fascinating the connections drawn<br>between obviously the the dramatic<br>events<br>in ukraine and in wider europe at the<br>moment and the connections of those<br>through to china uh we heard rodney<br>jones call out february 4th as a date<br>that might uh live on when the history<br>books are written about the joint<br>statements<br>between china and russia so i mean it<br>was a fascinating discussion we're we're<br>here in a small country that's you know<br>we ride the waves on this we're not the<br>influencer or the power player what did<br>you make of that<br>well the most sobering aspect was<br>rodney's comments you know and what was<br>already a sobering topic was was<br>rodney's comments about the risks around<br>taiwan<br>and i think i think he's right to bring<br>them up it's not something we'll discuss<br>yet<br>in in the world the focus will be<br>rightly on russia's invasion of the<br>ukraine but it does seem that we're<br>we're seeing a significant change in the<br>world order uh currently<br>which led to a conversation about<br>globalization and how much it was in<br>retreat<br>and and how much uh<br>the u.s led if you like post-world war<br>ii system<br>is fraying around the edges and you know<br>the reality is we've we've had the was<br>currently the 10th the 12th largest i<br>think 12th largest<br>economy isn't is invading its neighbor<br>and<br>the world seems powerless to do anything<br>about it at this point and you know<br>there was a period in the 90s when we<br>all thought that<br>uh that where as economic growth<br>occurred there was a famous story about<br>you know if you had a mcdonald's in both<br>countries they'd never invade each other<br>well i'm sorry um it's just happened<br>and and so we uh<br>we are in suddenly very difficult times<br>the reassuring aspect of that was the<br>consensus amongst the panelists that<br>if if the west rediscovers its mojo<br>uh by that was really referring to gigi<br>foster's views about about uh the sort<br>of<br>subsuming of economic um policies in<br>recent times but but when when when the<br>west does grow again there are certain<br>things about globalization that are<br>going to reassert themselves<br>and and so they really talked about a<br>retreat of globalization<br>not a complete abandonment of the model<br>which i think is importantly<br>right for this country because we we<br>survive on the global trading system<br>nobody owes us a living it's not like<br>we've got mother england sitting over<br>there like we did prior to the 70s so we<br>do need the system to work and all the<br>small countries the world need the<br>system to work so that was it was<br>positive but yeah very very sobering uh<br>backdrop and um and and you know we're<br>in the middle of<br>an upheaval of the world of of the world<br>geopolitics at this point it's it's<br>massive and<br>again i see the the overlay here between<br>the economic forces the political forces<br>and some of the sociological forces you<br>know those those senses of national<br>identity people have been talking about<br>culture wars within country<br>but i think we're looking at some of the<br>culture wars that maybe people thought<br>we had put behind us around liberal<br>democracies versus autocratic states i<br>think you're right we could be looking<br>at you know watching it unfold on our tv<br>screens<br>a real shift in the global order<br>tim grosso was very interesting on that<br>subject too i mean he<br>he raised the issue as to as to whether<br>putin is completely miscalculated<br>and<br>and really signaling the economic<br>impacts on on russia's population of<br>this invasion could could be a<br>significant um a problem for vladimir<br>putin and we don't know how that's going<br>to play out to made the point actually<br>neither does he but<br>but<br>it it it is you know we're seeing<br>history being made in front of our eyes<br>and<br>and the challenge as you said for a<br>country like new zealanders how do you<br>navigate<br>that your way through that and and<br>achieve the best outcomes for your<br>people yeah absolutely<br>so<br>as you know we we started the new<br>zealand economic forum series uh for<br>rigorous analysis vigorous debate we've<br>had a lot of that over the last<br>couple of days what are you most looking<br>forward to when it's a hard question<br>2023 who who would have been able to<br>predict today<br>last year but 2023 when we meet again<br>what's what's on your watch list well i<br>remember how much things have moved on<br>since we started planning this thing um<br>you know four or five months ago and as<br>to where we ended up and think yeah<br>that's a that's a tough question<br>but i think i'm excited about the fact<br>that hopefully next year it'll be in<br>person<br>i'm hoping that we'll still do it online<br>as well because i think we can attract<br>an audience online and a discussion<br>online which is different than one in<br>person but jim bulger made the point<br>yesterday there's a big part of these<br>conferences is the conversations that<br>happen around the conferences and<br>unfortunately we've had less of that<br>this year but you've got the new<br>building coming on stream the par which<br>i think will be a phenomenal venue to<br>host this conference<br>and hopefully next year we'll be will be<br>in person<br>and have the opportunity to discuss<br>hopefully a clearer<br>forward environment um post covert<br>that some sort of order has been<br>reestablished in in<br>eastern europe<br>and uh hopefully china has<br>not taken any lessons from from the<br>putin adventures so we'll see how we go<br>yeah it's a we're living in interesting<br>times which is not always a blessing as<br>the saying says anyway thanks a lot for<br>your uh your help and your work over the<br>last two days and we'll look forward to<br>a<br>to another forum in the next few months<br>and we know that there will be eventful</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
