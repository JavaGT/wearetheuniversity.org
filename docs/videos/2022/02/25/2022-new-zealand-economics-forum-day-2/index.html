the<br>waikato management school<br>of course we're waking to news today<br>very sad news out of europe that it<br>looks like there is<br>war in ukraine we touched on that<br>yesterday and of course i suspect it<br>will be a theme during today's<br>conversations<br>we've had a long discussion yesterday a<br>long day for those watching online but a<br>lot of fantastic presenters so thanks<br>again to all that presented yesterday<br>and we've got a very strong session this<br>morning<br>we'll be joined here soon by reserve<br>bank governor adrian orr of course<br>monetary policy very much in the<br>spotlight<br>he'll be speaking at about 8 45<br>following him we'll have an expert panel<br>on monetary policy so that's going to be<br>an interesting back-to-back session<br>we'll then have a session on fiscal<br>policy again looking forward to that and<br>the interplay between them<br>we'll take a brief break at 11 then<br>we'll go into a perennial favorite in<br>the new zealand economic scene of<br>housing and infrastructure<br>before our last panel on globalization<br>which has taken on new significance of<br>course with the events over the last<br>weeks and particularly overnight<br>to start us off for the day before we're<br>joined by the reserve bank governor i'm<br>going to<br>welcome professor frank scrimgeour<br>a distinguished professor of economics<br>here at the university of waikato and<br>also head of our school of accounting<br>finance and economics i'll pass over to<br>you frank welcome<br>thank you matt tina koto kato<br>may i add my welcome to this second day<br>it is a great opportunity uh for us as<br>we<br>build on the depth of uh<br>analysis and see how the different parts<br>as we<br>move into this day i'd like to remind<br>you of<br>the famous saying of<br>that<br>economist and educator alan blinder that<br>we need<br>hard heads and soft hearts if we are to<br>really address the major challenges of<br>our age<br>i'd also<br>remind you of<br>nobel laureate james buchanan who<br>reminded us that we need to address the<br>big questions and get those uh<br>fundamentally right<br>and and spend less of our time focusing<br>on specific<br>levers or real world observations or<br>complicated uh econometric models if we<br>are to make progress<br>however<br>we<br>we do need to use these skills<br>but we do need more<br>than good<br>attitudes and kindly aspirations<br>action<br>analysis<br>execution<br>planning and persuasion<br>increased understanding<br>making progress in all of these areas<br>requires us to have<br>engaging conversations and so<br>this<br>event today it it's a point in time when<br>we can grapple with these important<br>issues which we must grapple with<br>but we are part of a longer<br>term conversation and<br>and i believe that what we're doing<br>today builds on the the legacy of of<br>brian philpott and brian easton who<br>spent a<br>lifetime trying to enhance<br>the economic literacy of this nation<br>and so now it is our<br>opportunity to participate<br>yesterday we heard from<br>academics<br>and officials we heard from<br>business people and labor<br>representatives we heard from retired<br>politicians we have more of the same<br>today joined by<br>bank economists and others<br>but the challenge for us is is to engage<br>to listen to put the difficult questions<br>on slido<br>to um if you like to to suck the juice<br>out of the orange and spit out the pips<br>so that we might<br>we have this conversation as i said as<br>part of history<br>and history<br>hits us in various forms<br>we've watched<br>emerging destruction in europe overnight<br>and it's a reminder to us all that we<br>need to listen<br>and speak<br>and listen again<br>and then act with<br>focus and<br>integrity<br>i welcome you all to your participation<br>today<br>and i personally am enthusiastic to uh<br>hear your voices<br>kia ora frank thanks for that<br>right without any further ado<br>i would like to welcome the governor of<br>the reserve bank adrian orr back to the<br>new zealand economic forum it was great<br>to have you here in person<br>uh last year adrian at your old<br>university uh no doubt brought back some<br>memories and uh<br>hopefully next year back in person again<br>but in the meantime looking forward to<br>your talk today i'm sure it will be<br>keenly watched given other statements<br>earlier in the week we'll hand over to<br>you for those watching online please do<br>get questions through on slido i'll<br>receive those here in the studio and<br>after adrian's speech we'll have the<br>chance to put some questions to him<br>adrian over to you<br>um<br>and thank you uh matt thank you wakato<br>university um for this opportunity<br>and welcome everyone um uh and i look<br>forward to your questions so uh today<br>i've actually we've uh putting a speech<br>out on the record so um the good news is<br>you can put your notes down you'll be<br>able to read<br>what i've had to say<br>uh in the comfort of your own homes um<br>and yes i do look forward to being there<br>in person and i i strongly believe that<br>will be the case for this time next year<br>so um central banks around the world are<br>currently confronted with a<br>a significant challenge and it's a<br>challenge we haven't seen for some time<br>but it is a challenge we're familiar<br>with and that is rising inflation<br>pressures<br>the unfamiliar part really is the<br>environment within which we are tackling<br>this uh inflation challenge<br>these environments are always unique and<br>the world is always uncertain so this<br>morning i really just want to touch on<br>the context that we made our monetary<br>policy decisions in um particularly over<br>uh<br>this week<br>and also some of the challenges both the<br>ones we have faced and we face ahead and<br>in particular unique<br>aspects of these challenges for monetary<br>policy<br>so without doubt the covet 19 pandemic<br>provided<br>really a unique setting for many central<br>banks<br>we had to meet our low and stable<br>consumer price inflation goals<br>are really in the context of a unique<br>and emerging health economic shock<br>throughout<br>the world<br>in early 2020<br>there were some really challenging<br>factors facing policymakers economic<br>policymakers globally<br>the economic outlook and hence any<br>optimal policy response became very<br>dependent on the scale and the severity<br>of the covert 19 virus<br>this scale and severity in the meanwhile<br>became dependent on a host of factors<br>how individuals households governments<br>and central banks<br>would react to the pandemic environment<br>the pace at which a vaccine would be<br>developed and how effective that vaccine<br>would be and how quick it could actually<br>be rolled out internationally<br>and of course how the virus would evolve<br>over time<br>so we're still amongst this at the<br>moment but<br>they were very unique and uncertain<br>challenges for us<br>epidemiologists<br>throughout the world struggle to model<br>and predict the path of the virus<br>but these predictions played a<br>considerable role in how governments and<br>central banks developed any<br>appropriate economic policy response<br>from the outset of the shock um we made<br>it very clear here at the reserve bank<br>and through our monetary policy<br>committee that any search for economic<br>certainty was futile<br>and instead we needed to provide as much<br>monetary policy certainty<br>as possible within that uncertain<br>economic environment<br>this is why we adopted a leased regrets<br>framework for deciding on our actions<br>and we continue to do so today<br>and by this we mean ensuring that we<br>avoid the worst policy mistakes while<br>maximizing our ability to continue to<br>meet our objectives over the medium term<br>in early 2020<br>the risks to the global economy were<br>heavily skewed to the downside it was an<br>incredibly biased<br>outlook to the downside for inflation<br>and for<br>economic growth and employment<br>governments had<br>deliberately restricted economic and<br>social activity<br>so as to control as best as possible the<br>spread of the covert 19 virus<br>people also acted to protect their own<br>personal health and well-being first and<br>foremost<br>new zealand faced a very material threat<br>of experiencing a prolonged<br>period of below target consumer price<br>inflation and employment levels well<br>below any measure of uh maximum<br>sustainable levels<br>uh the situation that we most wanted to<br>avoid was one where inflation and<br>economic economic activity and<br>employment became persistently depressed<br>we were especially concerned about the<br>scarring impact on new zealand's<br>economic capability as business<br>investment<br>came to a halt<br>and to avoid<br>high unemployment and high unemployment<br>becoming persistent through time<br>so obviously our path of least regrets<br>was to move very quickly to ease<br>monetary conditions and to take other<br>steps to bolster what i would call cash<br>flow and confidence throughout the<br>economy through this initial wave of<br>uncertainty<br>uh a unique challenge was of course that<br>we entered this period like many central<br>banks around the world with nominal<br>interest rates very near their effective<br>lower bound<br>by that i mean where the official cash<br>rate any further reductions in the<br>official cash rate become ineffective in<br>bringing forward spending activity<br>uh i mentioned this was the case<br>globally<br>and it followed after a very long period<br>of low and stable inflation and<br>declining global real interest rates<br>so i meant the committee like many other<br>peer central banks needed to supplement<br>our official cash rate policy tool with<br>additional forms of monetary policy<br>easing<br>our aim was to further lower long-term<br>interest rates below where what we could<br>achieve with the official cash rate<br>fortunately for us we had been preparing<br>for these types of um uh<br>uh situations prior to the covert 19<br>outbreak and so we were able to operate<br>and work<br>pretty quickly in the face of this shock<br>uh we responded to the cover 19 shock<br>initially by lowering the official cash<br>rate uh by 75 basis points so we took it<br>down to as<br>what we would consider it's then<br>effective lower bound and we implemented<br>additional monetary policy tools and<br>this included the large-scale asset<br>purchase program and the funding for<br>lending program<br>our monetary stimulus over time<br>was thankfully accompanied by<br>significant government spending and<br>investment fiscal support um<br>including transfer payments<br>and this was incredibly important given<br>some of the specific supply-side nature<br>of this economic shock<br>the government's response in the end<br>turned out to be one of the largest<br>with across the oecd across advanced<br>economies<br>and it was very welcomed again i should<br>say from the monetary policy committee<br>the combined health and economic policy<br>response of new zealand has to do to<br>date<br>uh been ranked as one of the most<br>effective<br>across a wide range of countries<br>i will<br>point you towards some recent work that<br>david skilling<br>new zealand economists has produced a<br>simple hybrid index of of economic<br>health measures<br>and economic outcome measures and it<br>puts new zealand<br>you know at the top towards the top end<br>of the nation's global response<br>uh with the massive caveat that the<br>pandemic is not over yet of course<br>the reserve banks uh<br>monetary policy response you know<br>looking ahead um so you know that was it<br>was the early stages and then more<br>recently and looking ahead<br>uh our policy response is always going<br>to be based on achieving our mandate<br>we set our policy responses on<br>the information we have to date in hand<br>our assessment of how we think the<br>economy best works<br>and of course<br>retaining optionality around being able<br>to evolve policy through time<br>and be resilient to<br>any unanticipated future economic shocks<br>we are of course aware that monetary<br>policy can only provide a temporary<br>buffer to any economic shock and really<br>it's by bringing forward household<br>spending and investment or delaying<br>household spending and investments so<br>you know we understand that our impact<br>on the real economic activity is is<br>primarily temporary<br>as more information has become available<br>and we've had time to observe how our<br>economy and the global economic outlook<br>has evolved<br>our policy response has evolved<br>in aggregate we've been very pleased<br>with how remarkably resilient<br>the economy has remained in face of such<br>high uncertainty and<br>economic and social restrictions<br>we managed to avoid the worst scenarios<br>of embedded deflation and unemployment<br>but we now face a more traditional<br>challenge of con contro constraining<br>consumer price inflation<br>but still within this unique context of<br>this coveted 19 pandemic<br>we're now sure that employment is above<br>its maximum sustainable level and we are<br>very sure that inflation is too high<br>and this is occurring of course this<br>challenge for us is occurring at a time<br>when new zealand is now experiencing its<br>first widespread<br>to a significant extent the recent<br>increases in the consumer price<br>inflation have been driven by global<br>disruptions that have caused very sharp<br>upward price pressures in the economy uh<br>in particular for critical commodities<br>but a broad range of imported goods and<br>services<br>i you know i've just referred to the<br>events that are ongoing at the moment in<br>europe that's just another example of<br>how commodity prices can spike we've<br>oil prices uh well north of us 100 per<br>barrel so<br>this is uh these prices are things that<br>monetary policy can do nothing about<br>particularly new zealand's monetary<br>policy<br>in the decade prior to the pandemic all<br>of this imported consumer and price and<br>consumer price inflation into new<br>zealand was actually putting a downward<br>pressure on overall cpi inflation<br>we had these deflationary tradables<br>price pressures and they make up a very<br>large proportion around 40 percent of<br>new zealand's total consumer price index<br>basket and they acted as an anchor to<br>total headline inflation<br>meanwhile domestic driven consumer price<br>inflation the the non-tradables<br>inflation averaged more than two percent<br>per annum<br>over these years so headline cpi<br>inflation was being constrained by below<br>average tradables inflation and above<br>midpoint uh non-tradables inflation<br>downward pressure on prices from global<br>competition and technology uh progress<br>has at least for now abated um this has<br>resulted from<br>uh the pandemic induced shocks to<br>changes in demand patterns for example<br>from services to goods<br>the ongoing supply disruptions that<br>are everywhere and the reduced mobility<br>of goods services and labor<br>what it means is that we can no longer<br>rely on declining price pressures from<br>these internationally traded goods and<br>services and central banks globally<br>grappling with exactly this challenge<br>new zealand's monetary policy of course<br>has no direct influence on these<br>imported uh global prices other than<br>perhaps indirectly through our exchange<br>rate and even then that relationship is<br>the global nature of the economic shock<br>really has meant that exchange rates<br>have been incredibly stable over recent<br>times the whole world experienced this<br>kobe 19 shock at the same time and it<br>means there has been very little<br>relative work for exchange rates to do<br>um adjusting to the shocks and in fact<br>over over recent months what we've seen<br>is that global interest rate<br>differentials have narrowed<br>as other central banks have moved<br>towards uh more of the tightening<br>horizon that we have and we've seen the<br>new zealand trade weighted index<br>exchange rate um decline and it's<br>currently down around seven um if not a<br>slightly higher uh percent down around<br>seven to eight percent from um it's<br>pretty pandemic level<br>the most notable driver inflation<br>pressures has been um<br>in terms of new zealand has been<br>oil prices but i will say that the um<br>that tradable inflation is far more<br>widespread than just oil prices<br>the global economy continues um<br>to struggle to supply sufficient goods<br>and services to meet the strong ongoing<br>demand there's both a catch up from<br>from<br>demand running ahead of the supply and<br>there's also continued ongoing supply to<br>the future<br>so the degree of inflationary pressures<br>experienced across economies has to some<br>extent<br>very much depended on the different<br>starting points for economies as they<br>headed into the economic pandemic we do<br>have to remember that most of our<br>advanced<br>economy trading partners had experienced<br>for a very long long time<br>very low and subdued inflation<br>and persistently high unemployment in<br>fact it was only until recently<br>the central banks of japan the united<br>states the euro area australia and less<br>so here in new zealand we're all<br>increasingly concerned about<br>undershooting their inflation targets<br>rather than overshooting and obviously<br>this has since been tipped on its head<br>um by this pandemic<br>central banks are now signaling and<br>undertaking policy tightening these<br>policy responses do vary across<br>countries based on the starting points<br>for inflation for output gaps for<br>employment but they're all heading in<br>the same direction around reducing<br>stimulus and starting to tighten<br>monetary policy<br>enough about what's going on<br>internationally around which we have<br>limited influence if any<br>back here at home<br>domestic inflation pressures have also<br>been rising and this is an important<br>reason why the committee has responded<br>recently with tightening policy<br>and why we continue to have to expect to<br>do so<br>until we know that our inflation<br>expectations are well anchored and we<br>will have uh consumer price inflation<br>back within our target range<br>uh in one sense this is uh business as<br>usual<br>new zealand has a long history of<br>of bringing inflation down<br>as does the rest of the world where we<br>have a shorter history is working out<br>how to bring domestic inflation back up<br>so we're using our tried and trusted<br>monetary policy approach and that's to<br>ensure that inflation comes back into<br>its target and of course we have to do<br>this without causing undue volatility<br>and interest rates the exchange rate and<br>output and employment itself<br>again this is our mandate it's our<br>business as usual<br>our path of lease regrets has now become<br>one where we must ensure that consumer<br>price inflation and inflation<br>expectations do not rise persistently<br>above our target level and i think<br>anything less risks long-term economic<br>cost costs and reduced well-being for<br>all new zealanders<br>i suppose to highlight<br>our resolve to meet our remit<br>it's useful to compare our actions<br>globally amongst many of our central<br>bank pairs we were one of the first to<br>begin<br>removing monetary stimulus and start<br>this tightening cycle<br>we ceased our quantitative easing<br>activities in mid last year july 2021<br>and this was by ending the purchase of<br>our purchases of government bonds<br>and over the remainder of 2021 and until<br>recently we have now lifted the official<br>cash rate three times so by 75 basis<br>points<br>importantly we've also signed all these<br>more to come<br>and we have talked a lot about where we<br>believe the neutral<br>nominal interest rate is and how far we<br>may need to go above neutral<br>to achieve our inflation targets so<br>really the idea is we're taking our foot<br>off the accelerator as quickly as<br>possible<br>to avoid having to use the brake<br>unnecessarily in the future to maintain<br>our inflation mandate<br>so that's all um<br>strictly central banking<br>tasks nothing particularly unique or<br>unusual globally more unique and unusual<br>historically<br>uh some of the challenges that we've had<br>to face through all of this uh have been<br>um you know have provided great lessons<br>and and<br>we'll talk about how we're going to try<br>and capture these lessons and work with<br>everyone on this call<br>in the near future<br>one real interesting challenge was the<br>immense government fiscal support that<br>occurred internationally<br>it was very timely it was well received<br>and necessary<br>the level of of that fiscal support in<br>response to the pandemic was much larger<br>than we've seen in any recent shocks and<br>that was both in timeliness and scale<br>in new zealand fiscal support for<br>bolstering aggregate demand was very<br>welcomed by the monetary policy<br>committee given the size and the pace of<br>the shock we're dealing with<br>given the ongoing low nominal interest<br>rate environments and given some of the<br>very specific supply side effects of<br>of the health response that<br>we're undertaking globally and of course<br>here in new zealand<br>we do acknowledge now though that the<br>bulk of the fiscal impulse is<br>behind us<br>the government's response to the covert<br>19 pandemic was very strong over 2020<br>2021 and looking ahead it's becoming<br>more business as usual for fiscal policy<br>uh the treasury's current outlook<br>suggests that fiscal policy is expected<br>to be less symmetry for aggregate demand<br>in terms of impulse and hence add less<br>upward pressure on spending or potential<br>inflation in the economy<br>the committee's ongoing challenge of<br>course is to ensure that inflation<br>remains low and stable through this<br>period and that the fiscal policy can go<br>about its uh longer-term activities<br>activities<br>and i understand you all heard from<br>carolee mcleish yesterday which was a<br>very clear articulation of their<br>challenges<br>while fiscal policy has been an<br>incredibly important tool for this<br>aggregate demand<br>management i would say that monetary<br>policy will need to be stepping back up<br>more into the front line<br>over the period ahead<br>as it remains the most effective tool<br>for stabilizing<br>economic activity through business<br>cycles<br>and this is largely due to the ease and<br>frequency with which we can adjust<br>policy<br>our operational independence which is<br>critical to enabling us to go about our<br>business and of course the these<br>potential significant economic costs of<br>dynamically adjusting government<br>spending taxes and transfers<br>to cyclical behaviours<br>um<br>of course we will need to continue to<br>observe uh ongoing fiscal decisions and<br>um our monetary policy actions will<br>ensure that that any implications of<br>fiscal spending uh or fiscal policy<br>taxes spending uh wells fare transfers<br>and of course uh policies around uh<br>border opening labor mobility and other<br>things that impact on the supply side of<br>the economy these are all critical<br>inputs into setting our monetary policy<br>decisions i do want to emphasize of<br>course that there is no simple rule of<br>thumb between<br>fiscal spending and an inflation outcome<br>or<br>government decisions and an inflation<br>outcome it's going to always depend on<br>the impacts of supply to the economy<br>what's happening to the long-term<br>productive capacity<br>any implications for demand and of<br>course any offsetting implications what<br>it means for private sector investment<br>or spending decisions<br>so there's no simple uh rule of thumb<br>it's all about the nature of the<br>spending the nature of the tax changes<br>and the nature of the regulatory<br>environment that ultimately depend on<br>an optimal monetary policy response<br>response<br>another real challenge for us and one<br>that has been<br>very high profile and will continue to<br>be really is the role that monetary<br>policy is played with regard to asset<br>prices and asset price volatility in new<br>zealand you know this has been mostly<br>evident and most talked about through<br>residential house prices<br>like high consumer price inflation the<br>rapid rise in asset price inflation has<br>been a global phenomenon<br>um but the increase in new zealand house<br>prices has been exceptional and well<br>above uh global averages and it's taken<br>new zealand house prices what i would<br>say<br>is well above a sustainable<br>level by sustainable what we can explain<br>just through traditional supply and<br>demand<br>type<br>modelling<br>our research shows that it is the<br>persistent decline in global nominal<br>interest rates that most affect asset<br>prices<br>whereas changes in new zealand's<br>official cash rate relative to the<br>global rate has a much smaller effect<br>and we've been observing this global<br>secular decline in uh interest rates<br>for at least a couple of decades uh<br>driven by that low and global and state<br>low global stable inflation um a long<br>period of very low<br>inflation and structural factors that i<br>know this audience knows well<br>demographic issues productivity issues<br>all things that affect the level of<br>expected real economic growth in the<br>long term<br>a key reason why<br>lower global interest rates have had<br>such a significant impact on house<br>prices in new zealand really has been<br>the lack of supply of housing itself<br>land use restrictions and other<br>constraints on building have restrained<br>the supply of land and hence housing<br>i do note though that this trend has<br>recently turned building consents are at<br>a record level<br>and this is at a time when the<br>population growth through 2021 was just<br>less than half of one percent its lowest<br>level since 1988<br>and mortgage interest rates are now<br>rising and there is tighter access to<br>credit<br>we're now confronted with thinking about<br>how us how asset prices will reflect<br>will react to this rising interest rate<br>environment<br>and how homeowners might react to<br>declining household balance sheet worth<br>i will reiterate that house prices have<br>remained at a very high level<br>and i will note that household balance<br>sheets and corporate balance sheets are<br>in a very strong position<br>but it will feel different if house<br>prices start to decline and we're seeing<br>aggregate household balance sheets being<br>impacted already through their kiwisaver<br>accounts and other financial investments<br>as the global economy as asset prices<br>respond internationally to rising<br>interest rates<br>we also recognise that monetary policy<br>has distributional impacts<br>including through the housing markets<br>our research has shown that monetary<br>policy easing and tightenings<br>can affect the distribution of wealth<br>and income through multiple channels<br>but our mandate is very humble and<br>appropriate it recognizes the<br>limitations that monetary policy has on<br>influencing these distributional effects<br>the best impact monetary policy can have<br>is reflected in our mandate and that is<br>through<br>maintaining low and stable inflation and<br>doing so in a manner that contributes to<br>maximum sustainable employment<br>of course tiputian mature the reserve<br>bank of new zealand is what we call a<br>full service central bank and we have<br>responsibilities for both monetary and<br>financial stability purposes<br>our purpose for responding to any<br>unsustainable asset price movements is<br>really to ensure that the broad<br>financial stability is maintained<br>we would love to ensure that both<br>borrowers and lenders are able to manage<br>their financial risks through good times<br>and bad<br>and that any specific issues to the<br>otherwise do not lead to broad financial<br>instability<br>so to manage some of the cyclical<br>drivers of financial instability we have<br>been deploying over over the recent<br>decades uh<br>an increasing suite of macro prudential<br>tools since the onset of this pandemic<br>we have been active in<br>using<br>these tools particularly the key tool<br>around our loan to value ratio<br>restrictions at the onset of the<br>pandemic crisis we removed our lvr<br>restrictions load to value<br>ratio restrictions and that was so that<br>we could be confident that monetary<br>policy would be its most effective<br>that<br>cash that banks were able to have full<br>use of their balance sheet<br>to bring forward spending and investment<br>by early 2021 we were in a much more<br>certain position and we were able to<br>see how the pandemic was evolving and we<br>were confident enough to put<br>restrictions back on our put our lvrs<br>back in place and in fact tighten them<br>in a means of heading off any undue<br>financial risk<br>and high leverage particularly for<br>people entering the housing market<br>in recent times<br>so that's uh will always remain an<br>important and active part of not just<br>monetary policy but macro prudential<br>tools to assist<br>cyclical<br>challenges the economy faces<br>another real challenge for us was both<br>and the broader bank of course and the<br>fiscal authorities was in the design the<br>implementation um the calibration and<br>the explanation of our additional<br>monetary policy tools<br>in particular on the exploration front a<br>significant challenge was this<br>persistent singling out of the new tools<br>as the cause of<br>house price inflation<br>but as we all know causation and<br>correlation are different concepts<br>the additional monetary policy tools<br>were<br>that we utilized was simply there to<br>assist lowering nominal interest rates<br>across the yield curve<br>it was up then up to the financial<br>institutions and individuals to decide<br>how to utilize these lower interest rate<br>environments it was not simply a cash<br>flow transfer from us<br>into households to buy houses it was<br>about lowering interest rates it was<br>business as usual albeit through<br>additional tools<br>uh our large-scale asset purchase<br>program<br>affects long-term interest rates really<br>through this exchange of settlement<br>accounts at the bank<br>with retail banks for their bonds and<br>that puts downward pressure on bond<br>yields and heads downward pressure on<br>the yield curve and interest rates<br>in the economy<br>the level of government bonds on offer<br>is determined solely by the government<br>the fiscal authorities not the reserve<br>bank<br>likewise the amount of bonds the<br>committee chose to buy depends solely on<br>the committee's needs<br>not the fiscal needs of government so<br>monetary and fiscal policy remains<br>separate and the operational<br>independence of the bank remains clear<br>looking ahead<br>we are continually continually reviewing<br>our work<br>to improve the implementation and<br>formulation of monetary policy<br>uh our new legislation which comes into<br>into work in july one of this year<br>actually requires us which i think is a<br>wonderful thing and consistent with what<br>we see across other best practice<br>central banks globally it requires us<br>every five years to do a thorough review<br>of these monetary policy tools<br>and the idea is to ensure that we remain<br>accountable transparent<br>effective<br>and capable to undertake<br>the monetary policy agreements<br>our review process it's now underway<br>we've kicked it off<br>internally<br>and we are about to go externally and we<br>are going to be encouraging um insisting<br>that you all take part in assisting us<br>um work through this review<br>we're thinking about it in two legs the<br>first one is a backward looking review<br>an assessment of our policy performance<br>over the last five years<br>and the other part is about formulating<br>advice on the monetary policy agreement<br>for the minister of finance about what<br>if any changes are needed going forward<br>from these lessons we are legally<br>obliged through the legislation to have<br>this advice in front of the minister of<br>finance<br>no later than towards the end of 2023<br>but this is going to be a project that<br>we're undertaking<br>it will involve public consultation and<br>the first round of public cost<br>consultation is in the middle of this<br>calendar year<br>we're going to be looking at a lot of<br>the structural changes that may have<br>impacted on the remit and the operation<br>of monetary policy and the lessons of<br>activities of recent years<br>so i encourage you to take part in this<br>it's<br>really exciting to be involved<br>and it gives us a great opportunity for<br>everyone to be able to contribute their<br>thoughts<br>i'm going to finish up then just to say<br>look what have i done i've outlined the<br>unique global context to monetary policy<br>some of the unique tools<br>and contexts that we've operated in<br>uh i've acknowledged the role of asset<br>prices and distributional impacts that<br>monetary policy can have<br>can have on these issues and of course<br>i've put the panui out and the flag up<br>for the review of our monetary policy<br>agreement<br>kia ora alastair thank you<br>and uh the first reflection is just the<br>degree to which you and your team have<br>been in the hot seat over the last<br>couple of years um monetary policy has<br>probably<br>never had quite so many clicks on the<br>mainstream media<br>than in the last couple of years look a<br>lot of questions coming through over<br>slido and please keep them coming<br>through i'm going to start with a bit of<br>a nuts and bolts one you've<br>picked inflation coming back to<br>more normal levels we might call it<br>within within target ranges i believe by<br>mid 2023<br>which is sooner than some might have<br>picked and you're also looking at an<br>official cash rate uh up above three<br>almost three and a half percent out to<br>2025.<br>so can you give us guide us through the<br>committee's thinking on this<br>and where we see uh i guess<br>how long do we see inflation there what<br>gives you confidence that it's going to<br>come back within bound and you're<br>looking at the higher ocr out you know<br>three four years<br>wonderful the first thing that gives me<br>confidence<br>that inflation will come back<br>so the first thing that gives us uh<br>confidence around the inflation is our<br>policy remit and our operational<br>independence<br>so you know we can still uh have<br>significant and effective influence over<br>consumer price inflation within our<br>monetary domain<br>and and that's our task<br>now the second bit around around um<br>what we have to do to achieve that i<br>think it's really important to remember<br>where we're coming from is as important<br>as to where we're going with the<br>official cash rate so we're coming from<br>an extremely historically low<br>nominal interest rate<br>and a lot of the work we're doing at the<br>moment is simply getting us back to a<br>neutral a neutral interest rate and then<br>we're saying we may need to be north of<br>that for some time to be<br>effective i.e slowly stepping on the<br>brake<br>neutral nominal interest rates um you<br>know<br>i can't believe i'm saying this but we<br>say around two percent nominal that<br>still feels incredibly low historically<br>and so you know for a lot of people out<br>there in the economy this is um they're<br>going wow interest rates are rising but<br>they're going from something very low to<br>something at most quite average<br>and if not just marginally above average<br>so it's not quite as dramatic as it may<br>feel and that has been part of the<br>warnings and discussions we've been<br>trying to put out to people that normal<br>interest rates are well above where they<br>are making their first borrowing<br>decisions<br>the good news is that a lot of that rate<br>rise that we are talking about with<br>regard to the official cash rate is<br>already priced in to those<br>forward-looking curves and all and in a<br>large part being reflected out there<br>in mortgage rate land<br>and we know that uh over half of all<br>mortgages that<br>money that's out there at the moment is<br>going to be reset over the course of<br>this year so there's a lot built in and<br>a lot that already happen but we must<br>follow through with what we've said as<br>well um in order to to bank that um that<br>tightening that is priced at the moment<br>with regard to the actual inflation you<br>know a significant part of shifting from<br>where we you know we expect to be<br>peaking between six and a half seven<br>percent first quarter of this year i'm<br>deliberately being quite loose on the<br>first quarter cti inflation because<br>the swing variable of course is oil<br>prices and so this is the noise that<br>happens in near-term inflation<br>now a lot of those are one-off price<br>level shifts that even if they don't go<br>back down the mere fact they don't keep<br>going up you're going to see measured<br>cpi inflation come off<br>um over the course of 2022 and into 23.<br>we don't see headline cpi inflation<br>getting below the three percent you know<br>just getting into our target range until<br>next year<br>and being at the midpoint of our target<br>range until the year after so you can<br>see we are still trying to<br>ensure expectations remain anchored but<br>not be too dramatic<br>to interest rates output the exchange<br>rate we're trying to focus on that<br>horizon that we are most impactful on<br>and do it in a credible transparent<br>manner<br>thank you and that thank you for the<br>clarification<br>i'm going to go a little bit back into<br>the<br>the days 2020 and i'm sure they were um<br>they'll stick in your memory it must<br>have been a sense of drama almost<br>certainly across the world is as<br>everybody was figuring out how to<br>respond to the situation and then maybe<br>look forward you've talked about the<br>legislation requiring review i think<br>that's excellent that's part of the long<br>run of you'd say new zealand's<br>legislative tools around central banking<br>which have put us in a very strong<br>position<br>when you go back into that period when<br>was it that the bank<br>made the switch and i guess all of the<br>world and if you consider the the<br>economic consensus at the time around<br>demand shock<br>and then of course we've said now<br>actually it was more on the supply side<br>when did the bank start seeing that and<br>and start switching that view because of<br>course many of us have gone through and<br>we all know a lot more now so it's a lot<br>easier 2020 hindsight when did the bank<br>start seeing this as more of a supply<br>shock versus demand<br>yeah so i would say right from the<br>outset<br>we were very convinced it was going to<br>be both a demand and a supply shock<br>but in our least regrets framework uh<br>and given that demand is immediate<br>supply takes time<br>um we were<br>could see very strongly that the risks<br>even though it's both demanding the<br>supply this will dominate demand will<br>dominate first<br>and we needed to<br>dramatically reduce<br>the monetary conditions we also had to<br>dramatically reduce monetary conditions<br>because<br>being the only one standing there<br>was higher than otherwise interest rates<br>etc we would have had the exchange rate<br>going through the roof so part of it<br>so<br>the immediate shock to demand and supply<br>demand wins today do that and then let's<br>see where the dust settles around what<br>the supply capacity or constraints<br>actually are in the future<br>when did the supply can when did we have<br>confidence around the demand<br>had stabilized and when did supply<br>the supply issues really start to become<br>evident that was uh<br>more towards the end of and i'm<br>struggling to do more towards the end of<br>2020 and this is when we had said um you<br>know<br>don't expect a lot more we are just<br>maintaining monetary conditions at this<br>low level we're not looking for<br>additional things to do<br>and fiscal policy was the main show in<br>town we were actively trying to take<br>monetary policy off the stage<br>and say this is from here a fiscal<br>policy show<br>and<br>that was because of the more the more<br>targeted nature that fiscal policy and<br>general government um policy could take<br>on sectors of the economy on supply side<br>issues of the economy that monetary<br>policy just said no no effort over and<br>as<br>economic resilience<br>proved both on the global side in<br>particular and the holding up of<br>commodity prices and our terms of trade<br>holding up and as we saw the wage<br>support and businesses maintain balance<br>sheets maintain their strength through<br>through all of the<br>unprecedented uh fiscal policy response<br>that gave us the confidence by mid-2021<br>that we could now start to exit this<br>extraordinary uh monetary policy<br>loosening period and start to<br>re-normalize<br>uh in a manner now remember all this is<br>still being done in the environment of<br>the ongoing rolling pandemic<br>you know it's heady times yeah without<br>even factoring in the um the events in<br>europe overnight so<br>it might be a last question given time<br>constraints we could we could go for<br>hours um it's a theme again of what have<br>we learned and also looking forward<br>you've touched on distributional impacts<br>i i look at the the banner behind you um<br>well-being and prosperity for all new<br>zealanders and i know that you have made<br>that a central point of um of the bank's<br>focus<br>obviously some are sitting out there<br>saying this is the the stimulus that was<br>needed in the early days this has had<br>quite devastating impacts on those that<br>might not get into the housing market<br>you have made very clear there are only<br>so many levers the bank has<br>but thinking now again hindsight 2020<br>it's much easier but with hindsight as<br>you go into this review period if we<br>were to have another similar crisis what<br>have we learned<br>from the early days of what we as a<br>nation went through then<br>or as one of the questions came through<br>did we over rig it did we over stimulate<br>the economy in retrospect and what might<br>we do differently now<br>which i say isn't necessarily a critique<br>on where we were because now we have<br>more information but what have we<br>learned out of last time that we could<br>i would say first and foremost build<br>houses<br>you know this is the continuous<br>challenge of<br>wanting our cake and eating it too not<br>in my backyard not on my watch i'm<br>against it<br>challenges<br>that are writ large globally but<br>especially strong in new zealand<br>we had an unbelievable population growth<br>and a very very poor response<br>around housing i would be thinking hard<br>around the lack of depth and breadth of<br>our broader capital markets<br>which you know generally means that so<br>much of our intermediation is done<br>through<br>through uh reliance on housing as<br>collateral and also housing and as an<br>investment tool so those are much longer<br>structural things<br>i'm not um obfuscating from where the<br>central bank is but i actually think<br>it's really small um<br>incremental improvements you would make<br>around monetary policy relative to<br>significant changes you can make outside<br>of this institution<br>when you say whether have we under over<br>egged it well you know core inflation is<br>at the top end of our ban maximum<br>unemployment is<br>slightly above its maximum sustainable<br>employment i would say that's not a bad<br>outcome to date given from where we've<br>been and we're now<br>still firmly in control of keeping<br>inflation down<br>what uh did the committee most struggle<br>with throughout<br>getting line of sight and timeliness<br>around fiscal policy responses you think<br>internationally fiscal policy had been<br>told go away as an aggregate demand<br>manager um yet globally fiscal policy<br>appropriately immediately stepped up and<br>became the most significant<br>we had no real experience in new zealand<br>of direct wage subsidies or business<br>guarantee schemes etc around how that<br>would support and bolster housing so<br>that ongoing connectedness of monetary<br>and fiscal policy whilst retaining<br>the the operational independence is<br>critical<br>number one and number two the terrorists<br>uh tipu tiamata and the treasury worked<br>incredibly closely together and so but<br>we can always<br>think much harder you know i would love<br>the academic<br>effort<br>capability in this audience to be<br>thinking around that monetary fiscal<br>policy response and how<br>our supply side of our economy can be<br>more flexible to ongoing ongoing shocks<br>and innovation<br>um i see a um<br>a whole branch of uh<br>academic articles coming out on this<br>period over the years ahead i mean it's<br>it's been some heady times look we're at<br>the end of our time adrian thank you so<br>much for your time and and for your<br>team's time uh we'll of course now have<br>a policy uh a panel on monetary policy<br>so we'll get other views coming in and<br>then a session on fiscal policy as well<br>there are a lot of questions on the<br>inter-relationship between those two uh<br>part of a longer conversation another<br>time i think<br>but for today thank you again and wish<br>you well<br>until next time<br>thank you all the best<br>i'll pass back across now we're going to<br>go to our next panel uh this is the<br>panel on monetary policy and it's going<br>to be moderated by stephen joyce so back<br>across to you stephen thanks very much<br>matt uh very interesting uh comments<br>there from the reserve bank governor<br>adrian orr<br>and a couple of things he noted i mean<br>there's the ongoing discussion about how<br>much inflation is imported and how much<br>of it is generated internally<br>he did note uh and i've certainly picked<br>up that we had the i think he said one<br>of the biggest fiscal responses in the<br>oecd<br>and also we've had one of the biggest<br>house price increases in the oecd<br>in fact around the world uh<br>is wider than the oecd one of the<br>biggest house prices<br>increases over this period so the<br>question is<br>uh is the bank in the exact right space<br>which seems to be adrian's view which i<br>suppose is understandable if you're the<br>reserve bank governor um and or we<br>should be doing something differently<br>and we now have three panelists who<br>are able to help us with that discussion<br>to no end so uh<br>we have firstly sharon zolner who's the<br>chief economist of our biggest bank the<br>anz bank we have grant spencer<br>former deputy reserve bank governor and<br>acting reserve bank governor when yours<br>truly was finance minister uh and also<br>currently the adjunct professor in<br>economics and finance at victoria<br>university of wellington and live from<br>london and thank you very much charles<br>for uh giving us your time at this time<br>of the evening in london uh professor<br>charles goodhart who's the emeritive<br>emeritus professor of banking and<br>finance the london school of economics a<br>very illustrious panel um the plan is<br>team that we don't uh do too long in the<br>prepared comments you know you've heard<br>me on this already um five to seven<br>minutes to lay out your stall as to what<br>you think uh uh we are up to and what we<br>should be doing<br>and then uh<br>discussion for about the second half of<br>our session so sharon you've drawn the<br>short straw so you get to go first<br>thanks very much and thanks uh for<br>inviting me to be here again today<br>uh so i guess i'll stay right back here<br>how did we we get here and i think there<br>is an emerging consensus on what<br>happened<br>and that is that when covert hits it was<br>widely thought that it would be a rerun<br>of the gfc to some extent insofar as<br>that it would be a big<br>negative long lasting hit to confidence<br>and spending and therefore both monetary<br>and fiscal policy should do everything<br>they possibly could to shore up demand<br>and that while there were obviously<br>consequences for the supply side of<br>things that those would be relatively<br>short-lived and sort themselves out<br>pretty quickly because that's what<br>capitalism is good at<br>however what we've seen of course is the<br>complete opposite<br>that with the very able support of both<br>monetary and fiscal policy what we had<br>was a series of very short-lived demand<br>shocks whereas the hit to the supply<br>capacity of the world and the ability to<br>move goods around um all that sort of<br>thing has been extremely long lasting<br>and is showing no signs of of getting<br>better at all it's still getting worse<br>um and so of course that is a far far<br>more inflationary mix<br>um and it's<br>obviously problematic that policymakers<br>got it wrong they weren't alone in that<br>though i mean we were also waiting for<br>the other shoe to drop thinking we're<br>not believing our own business surveys<br>businesses were telling us that we were<br>in one heck of a v-shaped recovery we're<br>going but<br>we've had a national income shock we're<br>all poorer now how can we possibly be<br>all spending like we've won lotto and<br>yet that's exactly what happened we had<br>incredibly strong retail spending um<br>underpinned by the very very strong<br>performance of the new zealand housing<br>market with house prices up um 40<br>since covert hit which is quite<br>something<br>um so and of course we now sit here with<br>much higher government debt um and much<br>and higher household debt businesses<br>however have have been<br>pretty pretty prudent so they're not<br>quite in the same boat as some countries<br>where every sector has leveraged up um<br>but nonetheless we are sitting with a<br>heavier debt load<br>than we had before um and much much<br>higher asset prices so in new zealand<br>it's mostly about housing but this has<br>of course been a global phenomenon so<br>whether you're talking about equities or<br>bitcoin or some of the more obscure<br>cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens<br>people paying a thousand dollars or more<br>for the ownership of an anime picture<br>which is this different from this other<br>one that's for sale for us ten thousand<br>dollars you know people are buying<br>investments that they don't understand<br>even necessarily what they are or what<br>they're for or what the risks are around<br>them that has definitely been a theme of<br>the last couple years uh it was emerging<br>before that but the obviously the easing<br>and monetary conditions the massive<br>surge of liquidity uh really did put the<br>fire under that<br>um we've been there before and it didn't<br>end well um and so i think there does<br>need to be some kind of reckoning uh in<br>some pockets of asset markets where risk<br>has been severely mispriced um for for a<br>very long time and of course the party's<br>been able to continue as long as central<br>banks are your friends but central banks<br>are now backed into quite the corner you<br>know u.s inflation's already seven<br>percent new zealand inflation could well<br>end up there uh given what's happening<br>to oil prices now um and so in that<br>situation there is really only one<br>mandate that counts everything else is a<br>nice to have<br>um and so<br>with supply shocks there are unpleasant<br>trade-offs that central banks have not<br>had to face for a very long time in<br>terms of stabilizing employment and<br>output versus stabilizing inflation so<br>you can see that in the forecast the<br>reserve bank is forecasting raising the<br>official cash rate steadily<br>as house prices fall so<br>that's unprecedented and so<br>the question is you know having had this<br>boom<br>globally can we now solve this inflation<br>problem without a bust is there a<br>forward path for the official cash rate<br>that will bring inflation back to target<br>in an acceptable time frame without<br>causing a hard landing in the housing<br>market<br>and in the economy more broadly because<br>obviously the housing market is<br>extremely important um for the new<br>zealand outlook we're all forecasting<br>exactly that we're all forecasting a<br>soft landing that the goldilocks<br>scenario i mean it's not it's still not<br>great but it's the best of a bad lot<br>where the economy does struggle we've<br>got supply constraints most obviously<br>the supply of labor but it really is<br>across the board uh board would be<br>another pressure point um but they're<br>all over the economy so we're going to<br>struggle to deliver strong growth in<br>that environment we've got rising<br>interest rates falling house prices um<br>six percent inflation there's a massive<br>cost of living impost on on households<br>now that's not a great growth picture<br>but we've got the reserve bank raising<br>rates throughout because that's the<br>reality of what you get with a high with<br>a supply shock<br>um so yeah our forecast for a soft<br>landing that would be pretty much<br>unprecedented that central banks managed<br>to beat 7 inflation without a recession<br>somewhere in the mix<br>so perhaps that's a good segue uh to to<br>grant spencer uh to talk about what he<br>thinks uh the reserve bank should be<br>doing from this rather awkward starting<br>point<br>thank you thank you very much sharon um<br>there's lots of points there we will<br>come back to and you're right we will go<br>straight to grant<br>uh uh who's in the interesting position<br>of after a long period of time at the<br>bank and now an observer of the bank and<br>observer of the monetary policy<br>responses of central banks around the<br>thank you well thank you stephen um and<br>thanks sharon<br>it's a pleasure to be here<br>um i'll make uh three points<br>the first one is that i do think<br>monetary policy has been easy for too<br>long<br>and the reserve bank does need to move<br>faster than this tightening cycle<br>is the highest it's been since 1990<br>it's across all the main cpi components<br>and so there is a real risk that<br>inflation is going to become embedded in<br>expectations and become very difficult<br>and costly to remove down the track<br>and as sharon mentioned you know with<br>the further pressure on oil prices<br>that's just going to make it even more<br>difficult<br>now the bank you know was<br>relatively speaking an early mover<br>with its first tightening in august last<br>year<br>but it's still been slow<br>it's just been a bit faster than other<br>central banks<br>it's expecting to still really have its<br>foot<br>on the accelerator up until the end of<br>this year in other words it's not<br>expecting to get back to neutral<br>until the end of this year<br>so<br>that's not a good place to be if you've<br>got a really serious<br>inflation problem brewing<br>you should be moving back to neutral<br>more rapidly<br>that that still is what's going to<br>reduce the regret of an embedded<br>my second point that is that<br>if the bank<br>does move more promptly<br>move faster<br>i think the overall tightening the<br>overall increase in the ocr and the<br>cycle<br>may not<br>need to be uh huge<br>and it may not need to be as high as<br>the terminal rate of 3.4 percent that<br>the bank indicated on wednesday<br>the fact is you know some of these<br>touched on by sharon<br>is that you know a very high level of<br>debt at the starting point<br>in the private sector particularly in<br>the household sector so that any<br>increase in ocr is going to quickly<br>erode discretionary<br>incomes<br>we've got the weakening housing sector<br>the housing market<br>and we know the rafter factors affecting<br>housing apart from the higher interest<br>rates<br>so that's going to you know reinforce<br>the<br>impact of the tightening policy<br>and thirdly the the synchronization of<br>global monetary policies<br>so you know if<br>if the reserve bank<br>actions are going with the global tied<br>they're going to be a lot more effective<br>so you know i feel that if the bank does<br>move properly the terminal rate<br>could be stay between you know two and a<br>half to three percent rather than being<br>north of uh three percent<br>if you're getting north of three percent<br>you that's the situation where you're<br>going to have embedded inflation as a<br>problem<br>and that risk of a hard landing that<br>sharon was talking about is going to be<br>greater<br>um the third point i wanted to make was<br>around<br>the unconventional monetary policies<br>quantitative easing accredited<br>so in our case the lsat program and the<br>in my view they can have benefits in the<br>short term<br>but bring significant risks and<br>distortions<br>the longer they're left in place<br>the main risk is that governments come<br>to rely on monetary financing of their<br>fiscal deficits<br>and the distortions is the undermining<br>of the fundamental drivers of term<br>interest rates which are the demand and<br>supply of loan funds and expectations<br>so while these policies may be used in a<br>crisis or an extreme situation<br>they should not become a mainstream<br>if we look at the lcap i think the bank<br>is sensibly<br>you know winding that up we called the<br>whole july last year and on wednesday it<br>announced<br>sort of a<br>the total zeroing out the government<br>bond holdings on the reserve bank<br>balance sheet over five years i think<br>that's a reasonable approach<br>and<br>so i would support that<br>on the other hand with the funding for<br>lending program<br>you know this this program is in fact<br>more interventionist than quantitative<br>easing because it's a it's a subsidy<br>it's a lending subsidy<br>and when you're normalizing policy i<br>would think that that should be the<br>first policy removed<br>um<br>not the last policy removed and you know<br>the bank has that not uh finishing up<br>until uh december this year<br>so that remains a bit of a mystery to me<br>but my central point here is that the<br>unconventional policies can be useful<br>but they should be more seen more in the<br>stabilization<br>lender of last resort category rather<br>than being adopted as mainstream<br>policies<br>so back to you stephen thank you very<br>much grant and we may come back on the<br>funding for lending program and<br>and of course other elements of your<br>comments as we proceed<br>uh to get the full picture we're going<br>to now take charles uh good hearts view<br>from london charles has been a friend of<br>this country for a long long time<br>uh he's had a relationship with the new<br>zealand reserve bank going back many<br>years and senior staff of the bank and<br>although it's fair to say in preparation<br>for this we've been giving them a quick<br>i suppose catch up on current situations<br>in this country obviously probably<br>helped by the last two speakers in their<br>comments so<br>charles with that in mind we'd really<br>appreciate your thoughts from a more<br>thank you very much i'm very glad to<br>talk to my various friends in new<br>zealand<br>um i'd like to start by saying that the<br>governor is absolutely right when he<br>says both that all central banks have<br>really followed exactly the same kind of<br>policies<br>uh facing the same kind of conditions<br>and that new zealand is not<br>unique in this respect in any way<br>and what is more that the reserve bank<br>was one of the very first to realize<br>that there was a need to stop the<br>massively expansionary monetary policies<br>that all the central banks<br>had followed<br>nevertheless<br>i think the 2021 is going to come<br>out as a year<br>when all the central banks including<br>the rbnz actually got it wrong<br>and they got it wrong by not seeing the<br>persistence<br>uh and strength of the inflationary<br>pressures<br>that were getting getting in place<br>um i could actually illustrate that<br>by saying that one of the standard<br>approaches<br>uh to trying to decide what kind of<br>interest rate was appropriate<br>is the tailor rule and the taylor rule<br>says that you ought to raise interest<br>rates nominal interest rates by more<br>than the increase in inflation over the<br>target level<br>and by the degree to which your<br>unemployment is<br>below the sustainable rate<br>now if you do that for new zealand i<br>haven't actually done the figures<br>exactly<br>my guess is that what you would get<br>would be the taylor rule would suggest<br>an interest rate of somewhere between<br>six and seven percent<br>in other words double the sort of three<br>point four<br>uh that people have been talking about<br>uh as the neutral rate<br>well okay um this is because there's<br>been a supply shock<br>um and it's oil prices and supply shocks<br>and with that and the other<br>um but i am<br>reminded very much<br>of how we got into the stagflation<br>conditions<br>uh in the 1970s<br>there was an oil shock in the 1970s<br>after the arab-israeli war<br>when some of you who are older like me<br>will remember that oil prices doubled<br>the traffic quadrupled quadrupled went<br>up four times a much percentage higher<br>increase than we're likely to see now<br>and a lot of countries and a lot of<br>monetary<br>central banks thought that because this<br>was temporary you should look through it<br>the problem with that<br>is when you get a sufficient increase in<br>prices<br>that it actually reduces people's living<br>standards and they don't like it and if<br>the labor market is strong enough they<br>will<br>seek and demand higher wages in line<br>and there was a difference between<br>countries which had tried to absorb uh<br>the arab israeli oil shop like the uk<br>and italy which got into an inflation<br>price spiral<br>and germany which said well we must<br>accept this uh because we have got to<br>keep uh the demand down so that we don't<br>hit a wage price spiral<br>now again you're talking about the<br>decline in housing prices but i'm when<br>you've got inflation rising faster than<br>the rate at which nominal interests are<br>going up<br>real rates are going down and people<br>will think that actually<br>the cost of borrowing in real terms<br>isn't rising yet very much<br>okay so that rises and nominal interest<br>rates will have an effect even if real<br>rates are still very low and for the<br>time being declining and given what's<br>been happening to oil prices and gas<br>prices and will happen to wheat prices<br>and food prices and fertilizer prices uh<br>the likelihood that inflation will rise<br>even further over the next three months<br>is almost baked in<br>and rising nominal interest rates are 25<br>percent when inflation is probably going<br>to be rising<br>at 50 basis points a month<br>is not what you might describe as<br>particularly strong<br>finally<br>um the governor and<br>the general consensus was<br>okay we're going to go back to neutral<br>well<br>alan blinder has just is just writing a<br>book<br>looking at how the fed<br>tried to deal with inflationary spikes<br>over the years since 1965<br>and in most cases not all but in almost<br>every case<br>you actually needed<br>interest rates well above neutral<br>and you had to have<br>possibly a short recession in order to<br>bring the inflation spike back<br>even if the initial cause of the<br>inflation spike appears to be simply<br>temporary because you cannot allow a<br>wage price spiral to develop and the<br>idea that people will go on believing<br>in<br>that that inflation will come back<br>to low levels if inflation goes on<br>rising<br>for a few quarters more is i think<br>somewhat wishful thinking<br>um<br>central banks are in horribly difficult<br>position<br>uh on the one hand if they don't do<br>enough inflation will get embedded<br>on the other hand if they do too much<br>uh<br>anywhere and that's not any new zealand<br>it's anywhere in the world we could have<br>an asset price collapse leading to a<br>recession which will do no one any good<br>trying to get a soft landing under these<br>conditions is actually rather it's an<br>analogy i didn't set<br>i didn't make myself but i think it's<br>rather a good one it's like trying to<br>land a 747<br>on the deck of an aircraft carrier you<br>know one one little slip either way and<br>you're in you're in the soup either<br>inflationary soup or recessionary soup i<br>wish every central banker and those of<br>the monetary committees the best of luck<br>in an extraordinarily difficult<br>condition situation and i think they<br>will need a hell of a lot of luck to get<br>out of this<br>without their reputations being<br>in difficulty<br>thank you very much charles and i think<br>we should probably credit uh<br>former prime minister bill english uh<br>with that uh new zealand former prime<br>minister bill english with that saying<br>because i where you and i discussed it<br>earlier in the week and we agreed that<br>it was quite a good one for the current<br>um scenario before we go back to the<br>rest of the panel i have a question for<br>you it's been<br>head scratching for me just how slow the<br>federal reserve has been<br>and just how little debate there was in<br>the us<br>beyond i think larry summers<br>about the inflationary effect of the<br>biden stimulus package soon after he was<br>elected<br>uh are we in a situation where people<br>have forgotten the lessons of history<br>and does that include the federal<br>uh i think it does i'm people are are<br>really quite myopic<br>um and and expectations you will expect<br>what you had in the recent past uh<br>they're not particularly good at looking<br>forward the idea that markets and sort<br>of swaptions and uh options uh are a<br>good predictor of what's going to happen<br>in the future the idea that the<br>difference between index linked<br>and nominal bonds are a good predictor<br>of what's going to happen in the future<br>that's for the birds<br>we can't foresee the future<br>and we have to be<br>much more<br>quickly adaptive to current conditions<br>and the belief that central banks have<br>somehow credibly anchored<br>inflation expectations and therefore<br>everything will come back to normal is<br>it i'm afraid it's just wishful thinking<br>i want to bring in the rest of the panel<br>now if i could there's a great old<br>saying which comes from<br>i think the inflation the last<br>inflationary period is that monetary<br>policy needs friends<br>and<br>the question we have now is<br>is<br>does<br>is monetary policy being complemented by<br>other government policies<br>or is there work to be done there i<br>think governments around the world are<br>trying to sort of contract out all<br>responsibility for inflation to their<br>respective central banks<br>in the new zealand context we have uh<br>minister robertson uh talking about<br>further increases in spending in this<br>year's budget<br>uh and we also have a government talking<br>about constraints further constraints<br>notwithstanding of course the very big<br>constraint at the moment of covert and<br>the borders but talking about tighter<br>immigration policy going forward than it<br>has been in the recent past<br>are we in a situation where<br>where other government policies are<br>going to make the reserve bank's job<br>harder to achieve that goldilocks<br>landing if you like let's start with<br>grant<br>thanks steven yeah well those uh other<br>policies are very important i think<br>from the point of view of fiscal policy<br>per se we heard carolee<br>yesterday<br>and so even though spending has<br>increased and is staying at a high level<br>the actual fiscal impulse apparently<br>um is actually is starting to come off<br>so<br>the<br>the the fiscal impulse<br>because you know the economy has been<br>strong the tax takes has been great the<br>deficit hasn't been<br>rising as fast as expected<br>that fiscal impulse is not a big<br>counterweight to<br>tightening monetary<br>policy but you know the other policies<br>you mentioned the sort of ones that<br>affect the supply side<br>uh clearly<br>housing housing supply is<br>an important factor<br>where the government is is making some<br>contribution there<br>and the other very important one that<br>you just mentioned the migration<br>that clearly plays<br>is going to play a major role in terms<br>of the these supply-side pressures so if<br>you're looking to ease the supply-side<br>pressures<br>by the freeing up of migration is<br>probably the biggest<br>factor<br>uh the biggest contribution they could<br>make<br>okay sharon what's your view should the<br>should the government be tightening its<br>fiscal response at this point<br>well<br>in a pure macro economic monetary policy<br>friend perspective probably yes but one<br>of the unfortunate consequences of this<br>pandemic has been widening inequality<br>and so it's pretty difficult to say<br>there isn't a role for<br>government to try and address that<br>but then in so far as you're supporting<br>incomes and trying to boost spending<br>power then you are working in exactly<br>the opposite direction uh to monetary<br>policy but then you start getting into<br>the question of who is going to pay the<br>price for solving inflation is it going<br>to be businesses who find it harder to<br>pass on price increases and we're in<br>their margins is it going to be minimum<br>wage or low wage earners who who don't<br>get perhaps the wage increases that<br>others might or is it going to be highly<br>indebted uh recent home buyers you know<br>the choices that monetary and fiscal<br>policy make will determine to some<br>extent who who wears the the cost of<br>that and what we have seen unfortunately<br>in the last two years is is that those<br>uh the more vulnerable members of<br>society have have worn quite a lot of it<br>and also the younger generation they're<br>the ones sitting there with the fiscal<br>debt they're the ones who have paid<br>through the no's for houses<br>and so you have to take that into<br>account as well unfortunately they're<br>not a very large voting bloc and they<br>seem to be a little bit athletic about<br>voting um but i do think that that's<br>something as well that fiscal policy<br>needs to take into account i've been on<br>a broader picture we've got the the<br>big numbers but we don't yet know what<br>they're going to spend it on and in such<br>a capacity constrained economy i think<br>that's going to matter a huge amount in<br>terms of how much inflationary pressure<br>it adds<br>charles what would be your advice to the<br>government of the day in<br>probably any country i suppose in terms<br>of<br>where they should be going with their<br>fiscal stance now and and their other<br>microeconomic regulatory policies<br>because it feels to me we're still<br>acting to some degree as if inflation is<br>not um<br>the the very significant problem that it<br>is<br>um well again new zealand is not allowed<br>it's not unique in any respect<br>uh on immigration<br>uh the population and particularly the<br>working age population for the uk and<br>the us<br>would go down from here on if it wasn't<br>for immigration<br>the only way that we're going to get a<br>increased supply particularly um and<br>this is something as an old person i<br>feel very strongly about of care workers<br>the proportion of old in our societies<br>is going to go up by leaps and bounds is<br>not something that most people attenuate<br>in the uk<br>actually want to do<br>we don't get immigrants in to help us<br>with it we're going to have a crisis of<br>lack of care of the old<br>and<br>also a massive great increase in wages<br>for those carers so on immigration<br>policy uh a lot of countries are going<br>to have to to uh to struggle with this<br>particular problem it's not just new<br>zealand<br>it may well be that attitudes for in<br>towards immigration of<br>the countries at large will have to<br>change actually quite dramatically one<br>of the other things that i would<br>advocate is that<br>uh prices of energy petrol gas and so on<br>are going to go way up<br>one of the things that i would suggest<br>is that when these prices as they will<br>start coming down<br>uh that you keep the domestic prices<br>high in order to deal or help to deal<br>with both climate change<br>and the fiscal problem both at the same<br>time so that i would hope that ministers<br>of finance simply don't allow the<br>subsequent decline in energy prices<br>which will come<br>to bring about a decline in cpi take the<br>opportunity<br>to raise taxes and keep pressure uh on<br>uh reducing fossil fuel usage okay<br>folks i want to move to uh<br>the impact of ultra loose monetary<br>conditions on asset prices<br>um and then of course the the the flip<br>of that which is the potential for<br>a rapid downward trend in asset prices<br>now new zealand context of sharon's<br>pointed out it's it's it's it's through<br>the housing market more than anything<br>else<br>uh the<br>early on in the pandemic uh the governor<br>or was making quite a virtue of the fact<br>that one of the great things about all<br>tourists monetary policy was people felt<br>wealthier um because their house price<br>was going up and their asset prices were<br>going up and they then they could<br>therefore feel confident about borrowing<br>more earlier this week he was distancing<br>himself from that<br>and saying well they should have been<br>more careful potentially if uh interest<br>rates are now going to go up<br>uh so sort of a little bit of having<br>your cake and eating it too but<br>nevertheless<br>one of the things that strikes me is<br>we've had a long discussion in this<br>country about house house supply and<br>and and the impact of various factors on<br>house prices but certainly in recent<br>times it seems that you know no infla no<br>immigration<br>uh<br>large numbers of housing consents and<br>building going on that we've we've<br>really been driven a lot by low interest<br>rates that that's that's pushed people<br>um to perhaps pay more than they would<br>ever pay previously in the housing<br>market<br>have we got a problem here<br>that as rates go up uh you know get to<br>three and a half percent in the bank<br>scenario possibly more than that and<br>charles's scenario<br>how are people going to feel<br>uh if the impact is less equity in<br>housing and the drop in housing prices<br>about the whole monetary policy<br>construct i mean this is a big deal<br>isn't it isn't it isn't there a<br>political dimension to this<br>in terms of the impact of particularly<br>first home buyers<br>so i don't know i'm going to throw the<br>ball to first but let's start with with<br>well you're right<br>um stephen um<br>housing whether we like it or not has<br>been one of the main<br>and probably the main transmission<br>channels for monetary policy for many<br>years i'd say the other main one is the<br>exchange rate<br>and both of them can cause problems from<br>time to time<br>so<br>yeah when<br>when<br>with the initial easing of policy a lot<br>of the impact was was generated<br>through<br>increased wealth<br>increased house prices increased wells<br>people feel more confident better off<br>than they go out and spend<br>and aggregate demand<br>is boosted<br>and you know and the policy has effect<br>so<br>all of those sort of side effects<br>related to equity and difficulty for<br>first-time buyers etc<br>but basically the the reserve bank sort<br>of sidelined those and tried and tries<br>to play them down<br>even though they realize you know they<br>are real issues they're unintended you<br>know distributional effects for example<br>but you know<br>monetary policy is not a perfect tool<br>and you know that's the way it has its<br>greatest<br>leverage as you say in the reverse<br>scenario now where we're headed down the<br>other side<br>a lot of those effects are going to be<br>unwound and there's going to be a lot of<br>discomfort<br>for people existing<br>homeowners but maybe some of the you<br>know the the the first potential first<br>time buyers lining up the younger people<br>may feel a little bit<br>better that that you know that maybe<br>housing is within reach after all<br>sharon i'm conscious that you're in the<br>sort of front line of this given that<br>you know you're the chief economist for<br>new zealand's largest bank so i imagine<br>you'll step carefully through this<br>minefield um so what's your read and<br>should we be worried probably as policy<br>makers<br>if you think about this debate i mean<br>one of the things i worry about is<br>whether we take asset prices into<br>consideration sufficiently<br>in monetary policy decisions so maybe we<br>can go a bit broader<br>yeah that is a thorny one because<br>bubbles are hard to identify in real<br>time but i i think there's a fundamental<br>problem actually with the way monetary<br>policy works and that is that recessions<br>are by their very nature unforecastable<br>they're basically a collective freak out<br>and that's a very unstable thing that<br>you can never forecast<br>so<br>therefore monetary policy<br>isn't forced to take into account the<br>consequences of its actions today on<br>what the next recession looks like<br>because we know another recession is<br>going to happen there's always another<br>recession um you don't know when it's<br>going to happen but in in norway the<br>central bank actually has as one of its<br>objectives to lean into to counteract<br>the build-up of financial imbalances<br>that might make the next recession worse<br>so i mean there are issues with that<br>what how much should you lend should<br>doesn't that risk you setting interest<br>rates higher than necessary sometimes<br>but it would at least<br>force a discussion<br>about what are we doing to the next<br>recession because the depth of a<br>recession<br>depends very very much on the degree of<br>silliness that preceded it how how<br>bulletproof everybody felt and we have<br>definitely gone into the silly zone in<br>the last two years and we are going to<br>pay that price in the next recession<br>which you will not find in our forecasts<br>you won't find it in the reserve bank's<br>forecast we're hopeless at seeing<br>recessions coming but we know they will<br>come and we know that the asset price<br>appreciation we've had in the last two<br>years<br>is going to make that recession worth<br>worse was it worth it did we even even<br>ask that question the framework doesn't<br>actually encourage central banks when<br>they're setting policy to think about<br>that that bigger picture it's all about<br>maximizing growth in the near term if<br>it's currently too low<br>obviously we're in a different game now<br>where they're trying to dampen growth<br>but<br>yeah<br>we've overfilled the hole<br>and and now i'm a little bit worried<br>that we have actually<br>unnecessarily exacerbated the business<br>cycle and how bad that's going to get we<br>don't know but we are currently in in<br>quite a fragile situation<br>can i just make a comment there a<br>relevant comment chair<br>is that<br>sharon's point with<br>in the reserve bank legislation it does<br>actually say that monetary policy should<br>have shall have regard for financial<br>stability<br>you know there's the objective financial<br>stability objective and there's the<br>dual mandate<br>now you know in that major easing that<br>happened in early 2020<br>there was no there was no mention of the<br>having regard to financial stability<br>but you know this is something you do<br>that the central banks have to think<br>about and and different governors and<br>different central banks think about it<br>in varying degrees some put more<br>emphasis on the financial stability<br>aspect there's<br>uh this you know costs of<br>generating asset price<br>extreme asset price movements<br>and if that had been given more weight<br>in early 2020 you know maybe that<br>initial<br>uh major easing would not have been so<br>great when it started to become apparent<br>that housing was going to really take<br>off<br>just uh yeah put that doesn't that<br>there's there is that capacity in the<br>framework<br>the governor talks a lot about the least<br>regrets policy and every time he says it<br>worries me a little bit it was sort of<br>like just go big and then go bigger and<br>we'll worry about it later that's how i<br>interpreted it a little bit<br>charles can i bring you in i mean this<br>is not the first time we've had a debate<br>about asset price bubbles and<br>loose monetary conditions you have alan<br>greenspan back in the 90s and and then<br>they had the<br>dot-com bubble<br>here we are again potentially<br>is is do central banks as a as a rule<br>take enough notice of the impact of of<br>i think that you could uh suggest that<br>they take too much concern not all of<br>the central banks but the fed in<br>particular as you mentioned the green<br>span could<br>uh whenever asset prices in the u.s have<br>gone down really sharply<br>the fed<br>has to come back from any restricted<br>policies<br>in order to ensure that asset prices<br>don't collapse too much<br>uh and the very fact that uh financial<br>markets are declining quite sharply<br>after<br>putin's invasion<br>means i think that at the<br>next fed fomc<br>we are almost bound to get 25 basis<br>points rather than 50 basis points<br>because they don't want to upset markets<br>too much because they don't want to<br>upset markets too much<br>not not just<br>out of interest for the markets and such<br>but if you upset markets too much uh you<br>can get a recession there's always the<br>fear of 1929 at the back of the minds of<br>central bankers<br>um and uh the very concern about<br>uh asset markets being too frothy<br>and the likelihood is that the from now<br>on there's going to be quite a sharp<br>decline<br>means that it's going to be very hard<br>for the fed and for anybody else any<br>other central bank<br>really to raise interest rates<br>sufficiently fast<br>uh to keep a wage price spiral from<br>developing and getting going<br>and it's a very very nasty<br>you want to<br>tell the markets<br>no we're not going to support you in<br>which case under present circumstances<br>you've got a free fall in recession<br>or you effectively say we're going to do<br>things very gently and we're going to<br>warn the markets every time we're going<br>to move that sort of thing<br>and then the likelihood that a wage<br>price spiral will develop<br>is actually quite high<br>and aren't we at the point where this is<br>that that<br>that<br>approach has got completely out of hand<br>i mean look at the look at the multiples<br>of share prices<br>on the us stock exchange the nft<br>phenomenon<br>uh you know all the other things we<br>could highlight from earlier this year<br>the the i think it was the<br>the um takeaway joint that was worth you<br>know a couple of hundred million um the<br>whole thing<br>feels like this has all gone a bit too<br>far doesn't it and if if the bank the<br>federal reserve is running scared of<br>upsetting asset markets<br>then really effectively the green span<br>put continues<br>and will never get back to a more sort<br>matrix if you like<br>he said<br>sounding slightly<br>worried about these things sharon any<br>any thoughts from you there<br>you can suppress all evidence of risk<br>for a surprisingly long time but you<br>cannot eliminate risk as a central bank<br>and so i think people for a long time<br>have thought oh central bank's got our<br>backs um it's we're all good but you<br>know that that risk that volatility it<br>it gets bottled up and then it explodes<br>so i don't doubt we're going to get back<br>to a more sustainable and sensible<br>valuation for assets we may undershoot<br>but but we'll get there because<br>those market forces will not be denied<br>forever it just could be a bit of an<br>uncomfortable path as i think i think<br>we're all on the same page on that one i<br>sense that if i think i pulled this<br>panel on the likelihood of achieving a<br>soft and gentle landing it might not um<br>fare well um with with the three of you<br>can i get one final word then on the<br>russia ukraine situation charles you've<br>already made the point about the risk of<br>increased commodity prices further in<br>some of the key commodities<br>is there a chance for example uh well<br>will it will this make the current<br>situation worse you think from a you<br>know economic perspective and of course<br>you know we're all very worried for the<br>people of ukraine and<br>and there's a much bigger issue than the<br>immediate sort of economic impacts but<br>here we are talking about macroeconomics<br>or is there a risk actually that it<br>sends uh it sends the markets into a<br>negative tailspin which which actually<br>um alleviates the inflation risk or at<br>least assists the central banks with the<br>inflation<br>inflation risk again not wishing ill on<br>anybody<br>i think the answer is that both are<br>going to happen markets are already<br>weakened<br>uh i think they're inevitably going to<br>weaken further<br>but<br>in the short run this is a massive<br>further adverse supply shock<br>which sends prices higher and the prices<br>of fertilizer for example are and in the<br>uk absolutely virtually triple<br>uh you reduce massive wheat<br>uh exports from ukraine and russia<br>and the prices of basic foodstuffs of<br>flour are going to be shooting up over<br>the next six months i don't yeah there's<br>any alternative<br>um and they<br>only just makes the<br>both the outlook uh and the problems of<br>market weakness on the one hand and<br>inflation getting out of hand on the<br>other uh that much worse and it's it's<br>bad news<br>uh however you look at it<br>grant and sharon particularly from the<br>new zealand perspective um<br>well you know it's a it's a terrible<br>event<br>um and it will have significant<br>short-term effects but being sort of<br>clinical about it<br>from from a sort of an historical<br>perspective um<br>if you look at the impact of wars on<br>on financial markets often<br>it can be quite a short sharp<br>uh sell-off<br>um<br>i don't have much doubt that the market<br>i mean the markets are selling off but<br>it's it's not major<br>obviously if it blew up into something<br>really uh<br>more serious and bringing in other<br>countries then that's a different<br>picture but<br>the way it's looking now<br>i would see markets uh bouncing back<br>and even now you know the market analyst<br>focusing on really you know what the<br>fed's going to do whether it's going to<br>be it is starting to adjust from 50<br>points back to 25 points<br>you know and focusing on the policy as<br>opposed to this particular um<br>geopolitical event in europe<br>and just for just one point on the<br>interest rates in terms of those<br>overvalued assets<br>that<br>you know in the in the recent cycle<br>the central banks of this world have<br>contributed to zero and negative rates<br>so they're really exacerbated<br>those elevated asset prices but<br>underlying that over the past 20 years<br>has been a<br>downward secular trend<br>in<br>real interest rates which has been the<br>underlying driver of the of the very<br>strong<br>asset prices<br>over the past 10 10 years and longer<br>so you know i just don't want to<br>exaggerate or overstate the the central<br>bank's contributions of this the<br>underlying real factors<br>uh that are driving these markets as<br>well very fair point sharon we'll let<br>you have a final word on any of these<br>topics<br>there's so much to talk about uh yeah<br>obviously new zealand doesn't have much<br>direct trade exposure to russia or<br>ukraine but it does seem likely to boost<br>world oil prices and energy more<br>generally um and it's also hit the new<br>zealand dollar so that all adds up to<br>more pressure petrol pump and the<br>reserve bank basically said that that<br>increase in global infra inflation<br>pressures was a big driver of why they<br>thought the ocr needed to stay higher<br>because their framework basically<br>assumes that that has the potential to<br>have a persistent impact on inflation<br>expectations and in this environment<br>it's very hard to disagree so in that<br>context it definitely increases the<br>chance of the reserve bank hiking by 50<br>um at some<br>meeting in the in the future<br>if it persists because it's going to<br>boost headline inflation<br>but beyond the near term it's it's<br>symptomatic of a world where<br>geopolitical risk is a growing threat<br>and i think that's going to contribute<br>to<br>partial unwinding of the globalization<br>which has been such a deflationary force<br>in the last decade or two and so i think<br>it just does underpin that we're no<br>longer in a world where inflation needs<br>to be lovingly nurtured where we're in a<br>world where it needs to be smacked on<br>the head regularly uh which isn't in a<br>way back to normal and not entirely bad<br>in that sense but we've got we've got<br>quite a problem on our hands uh for now<br>though and i think we're all<br>pretty much on the same page that that's<br>going to be a very very challenging<br>environment for some some time yet<br>thank you very much all three of you for<br>your time a sobering assessment but also<br>a very uh a very uh sensible assessment<br>of where things are at charles thank you<br>very much for joining us from london<br>late in the evening there now i know we<br>do appreciate your contribution and also<br>to grant and sharon thank you very much<br>for joining us on the economic forum<br>today<br>well matt a very interesting uh<br>session and taking the two together with<br>reserve bank governor adriano<br>and uh<br>and this group a lot to think about a<br>lot to talk about<br>huge i think it's been a big warning<br>already thank you to the to the panel to<br>charles grant and to sharon um there's<br>a lot to consider<br>on many different fronts and it's<br>particularly valuable of course having<br>had the governor and the expert panel<br>back to back<br>what you would have picked up of course<br>a theme right through the the last<br>couple of hours is the interplay between<br>monetary and fiscal policy so obviously<br>the two are uh<br>working in tandem somebody said monetary<br>policy needs friends and that brings us<br>into our next panel just a quick run<br>through of how the rest of the morning<br>is going to pan out before we wrap up<br>the forum a little bit before one<br>o'clock so our next panel will be on for<br>school policy and i'll introduce that in<br>just a moment we'll then have a short<br>break at about 11 for 15 minutes<br>after that we'll come back with two<br>other topics that have been<br>discussed regularly that's housing<br>that'll be at 11 15 and on to a panel on<br>the global situation that'll be at 12<br>noon<br>so all of these have been raised<br>regularly during the morning and i<br>expect will<br>will continue to be a lot to consider<br>i'd like now to pass over to our panel<br>on fiscal policy this will be moderated<br>by professor liz oxley<br>one of our team here at the waikato<br>management school so liz over to you and<br>looking forward to another good<br>discussion<br>maureen and welcome everyone to today's<br>session this morning looking at fiscal<br>policy alternatives and opportunities<br>my name's les oxley i'm professor of<br>economics at new zealand's number one<br>business school the waikato management<br>school<br>toro papa and<br>it's<br>i think very opportune that the fiscal<br>policy session follows what has been a<br>very active monetary policy session<br>but also follows the<br>discussion coming from carolee mcleish<br>our opening session<br>and i'd like to stress that this<br>particular session is looking at<br>alternatives and opportunities for<br>fiscal policy moving forward<br>and<br>we heard last night from jim bulger<br>a bit of a call for something different<br>from us in terms of moving forward he'd<br>heard many of these things before and<br>was throwing out the<br>opportunity for us to produce something<br>new<br>but also i've just heard in passing<br>charles goodhart<br>talking about<br>an opportunity here<br>for new zealand to take the opportunity<br>to increase taxes<br>so we have alternatives and<br>opportunities available to us<br>we've got a wonderful panel here to help<br>discuss and<br>put their cases in terms of alternatives<br>and opportunities i'm going to give a<br>very brief<br>introduction<br>we have mark holmes<br>who's a professor of economics here at<br>um the wecado management school<br>mark's<br>expertise is in macro policy<br>and also macro theory but also has done<br>a lot of work on<br>housing infrastructure and other tax<br>related issues<br>we have sir robert mcleod who is<br>chairperson of sanford keysight holdings<br>he's got a long history in terms of his<br>tax expertise so he knows what has been<br>done<br>and has a equally strong reputation in<br>terms of looking at issues related to<br>indigenous in particular maori issues<br>which i think<br>we haven't really touched on<br>apart from under the maori business<br>session that we had<br>and we have oliver hartwich who is from<br>the new zealand initiative<br>oliver has a a much more extensive track<br>record than we have seen necessarily in<br>the in new zealand coming from a<br>background working in sydney and<br>advising i noticed the house of lords<br>in the uk a very<br>interesting advisory role so without<br>further ado i'd like to call upon mark<br>holmes to um to to pitch his<br>five to seven minutes<br>store here and tell us about some<br>opportunities and alternatives thank you<br>mark<br>i want to say a few things about fiscal<br>policy alternatives and opportunities um<br>clearly this is a<br>big topic and falling on from the<br>closing comments yesterday you know this<br>is one of those areas that could have<br>occupied an entire forum<br>um<br>within itself<br>um but i i want to uh<br>just broach um<br>one or two issues related to the uh the<br>way forward that we might um<br>experience<br>so<br>as we're aware<br>there's been a deterioration in<br>public finances not just new zealand but<br>elsewhere<br>and<br>we have a degree of<br>uncertainty over the future course of<br>covet so<br>we're aware of the potential for stop<br>start<br>economies impact on business confidence<br>problematic international travel<br>so on and so forth<br>so from the point of view of<br>fiscal policy makers<br>volatility of revenue streams<br>challenges in terms of planning fiscal<br>expenditure in the context of<br>stabilization policy<br>and against that we have a background in<br>terms of issues that include an aging<br>population and<br>concerns over<br>productivity growth<br>so<br>what i see the opportunity here is in<br>terms of<br>a reflection on<br>tax and spending policies you know what<br>once um<br>if you like a recovery is well underway<br>from the covid era and it seems that the<br>new zealand<br>government will need to start thinking<br>about getting its fiscal position<br>in order but of course a premature<br>withdrawal of fiscal support or<br>increased taxes<br>could potentially<br>undermine<br>undermine the recovery so<br>what i'm<br>really going to touch upon is<br>you know what what might happen<br>post covid and<br>perhaps relating to um<br>an issue that was covered in the opening<br>presentation yesterday in terms of<br>prudent investment versus<br>prudent debt<br>you know do we need to be very careful<br>about<br>rolling things forward in that respect<br>or do we have a case for bringing<br>public debt to income ratios back down<br>to where they were<br>previously<br>now if we look at the<br>data i mean i've just delved into the<br>oecd database<br>before the talk and it's clear that uh<br>by the measures presented there if we<br>look at the budget deficit<br>as a percentage of um gdp<br>new zealand sits um<br>relatively okay compared to other um<br>oecd countries<br>uh that i've been<br>looking at of course out with other<br>countries there's been a deterioration<br>there but um<br>you know it's it seems to be in a<br>in such a<br>negative territory um over time and if<br>we look at um<br>debt to income which you know where debt<br>is um<br>you know in part based on the<br>accumulation of past deficits<br>we can see that um nz<br>public debt to gdp again<br>looks um<br>reasonably respectable<br>compared to other oecd members and the<br>oecd<br>average okay sure there's been an<br>but<br>it seems to be um<br>an issue that is not as high as some of<br>the scary values that we've observed for<br>other countries so perhaps things don't<br>look as uncomfortable<br>as compared to<br>elsewhere so a question is<br>whether new zealand should aim to<br>rapidly re-establish<br>pre-pandemic levels of debt<br>or perhaps even pre-global financial<br>crisis<br>levels of debt<br>which saw a lower still<br>debt to<br>income ratio now fiscal stabilization<br>measures<br>might still be related to you know<br>pandemic issues over time we don't<br>really know how the situation is going<br>to unfold and as we're talking of course<br>we have an ongoing<br>major international crisis<br>and uh you know<br>we're cautious that this may to impact<br>on future<br>fiscal planning<br>as well but i wanted to<br>think about another question that has<br>come up in terms of prudent long-term<br>infrastructure projects and<br>is there still the opportunity to<br>invest in those projects at what are<br>still<br>low<br>interest rates and i'm thinking of<br>health education transport<br>we still have our climate change<br>obligations of course<br>and um whether we still have um an<br>opportunity to<br>um push forward on that in a sense if<br>you think about the<br>times going into better times uh post<br>covid does that free up<br>um<br>an element of uh budgetary support that<br>can provide resources that can be<br>allocated elsewhere<br>now when we think about the debt to<br>income ratio we might think about<br>um sustainability of that we see the new<br>zealand debt to income ratio<br>increasing we've had much lower values<br>now increasing above i'm going to say 50<br>percent of gdp<br>um is that a stable or<br>unstable trajectory<br>over time<br>so<br>commentators might think about the real<br>interest rate that's<br>paid on debt and compare that to the<br>growth rate<br>of the<br>economy<br>okay so<br>comparison of if you like r and g real<br>interest rate growth rate of the economy<br>might provide a<br>an approximate rule of thumb not a<br>strict one because um you know there are<br>many um<br>um many bells and whistles many ifs and<br>buts in in<br>drawing out the um<br>theory but it might suggest that a<br>higher debt to income ratio may still be<br>sustainable if the real interest rate is<br>relatively lower but of course we now<br>observe interest rates going up<br>um obviously we have developments this<br>week in new zealand us fed next month<br>and we certainly will<br>increase interest rates i think and so<br>is this becoming a missed opportunity<br>with rising rates<br>over time<br>so<br>we<br>it's my opinion worth you know thinking<br>about this as as a potential issue if we<br>free up resources that can be<br>um put into longer-term<br>investment there are a number of<br>concerns okay so a fiscal expansion<br>could be in conflict with an inflation<br>targeting<br>central bank<br>there are consequences of high debt okay<br>we could be vulnerable in a future<br>financial crisis we have reduced<br>fiscal space<br>the economist recently published um<br>uh an estimated effective take not just<br>public but private debt as well twelve<br>percent of world gdp goes on um interest<br>costs<br>burdens in on future generations perhaps<br>um though longer-term investments may be<br>to the benefit of future generations<br>um so we've got all these these types of<br>issues so if that remains where it is or<br>stays high<br>then um you know maybe we need to think<br>carefully about why we've gone into debt<br>um in the<br>um first place there<br>so<br>when we<br>think about um<br>you know the way forward<br>we might say well<br>there's perhaps a need to improve<br>infrastructure but is new zealand<br>comfortable<br>with that are we better with<br>a lower debt to income ratio<br>i think of the work by reinhardt and<br>rogoff published in 2010 which you know<br>brought suggested that countries with<br>debt to income ratios above 90 percent<br>of<br>gdp<br>have a one percent lower<br>growth rate<br>now there's a lot of empirical scrutiny<br>there a lot of uh critiques of that<br>um but it's out there for<br>consideration and of course the prospect<br>that<br>if we go more into debt then that might<br>lead to an interest rate premium being<br>added to what new zealand tries to<br>borrow<br>rounding things off and say well you<br>know let's think carefully about where<br>we want new zealand to be in terms of<br>national indebtedness in terms of where<br>the public debt should be but perhaps<br>there are opportunities that we want to<br>think about that we can carefully<br>invest in if i look around new zealand<br>at the moment um<br>i'm<br>inclined to ask with one or two things<br>going on is there a fundamental problem<br>in terms of new zealand getting projects<br>completed you know i see projects out<br>there which<br>a huge value to the economy<br>transmission goalie that this is a you<br>know private public partnership joint<br>venture of course<br>you know two years overdue and no<br>guarantee will be finished by the end of<br>the year but<br>you know the obvious issues why that<br>hasn't really um<br>come about uh the auckland light rail<br>saga appears to um you know drag on for<br>quite a while<br>um<br>does lee want to wonder you know when<br>will this occur so you know<br>is there a fundamental problem<br>in new zealand in terms of you know<br>pushing ahead with projects that<br>are<br>you know desirable but<br>not really getting the act together to<br>put them into place and it seems this<br>has been an issue going on for<br>many years<br>okay i think i've<br>probably used my my time up there so i<br>will hand back to<br>les thank you for that mark um it seems<br>to be that<br>the opportunities that you're looking at<br>here relate to<br>issues of investment<br>which again as you suggest<br>haven't really delivered<br>even with lower interest rates<br>so um for now we'll we'll hold that<br>conversation and i'll um ask for sir<br>robert mccloud's views on alternatives<br>and opportunities<br>in this fiscal space<br>so robert<br>well thank you liz<br>and uh good morning everybody it's a<br>pleasure to be here um<br>as liz mentioned my background in fiscal<br>policy is tax and so i've um i'll focus<br>principally on that topic<br>um but perhaps this is a segway to that<br>um to that topic it's just worth<br>reflecting just on what shapes<br>tax policy and indeed the demand for<br>taxation in a<br>um in the new zealand economy<br>um<br>one thing i like to<br>to remind people of is that<br>the effective tax rate for the nation is<br>probably best thought of as as<br>government spending<br>as a percentage of gdp um<br>most people would uh you know not not<br>tend to think of it that way but the<br>point that that metric makes is that<br>essentially<br>deficit in um<br>financing spending through taxation<br>ends up obviously in a fiscal deficit<br>and if we're the other way we get a<br>surplus so i like the just to remind<br>ourselves that um the metric that's<br>important to keep a finger on or an eye<br>on<br>is government spending to gdp and um<br>and i think to me um spending being a<br>fiscal conservative spending is the<br>challenge<br>um<br>and<br>the government is resource constrained<br>as is everybody in new zealand let alone<br>the world and<br>the the public sectors and the private<br>sector really compete for resources so<br>if government spending gets out of<br>control gets too high<br>effectively it's crowding out the<br>private sector and one in this debate on<br>fiscal<br>management one has got to develop a<br>philosophy about what is to be done by<br>our government and what is to be done by<br>the private sector<br>and conventionally<br>most thinkers have taken the view that<br>the private sector is more productive<br>in producing our goods and services in<br>the government sector um but i think in<br>modern times that that old point tends<br>to be<br>is tending to be um put on the back<br>burner<br>and um cara lee's comments yesterday<br>morning for example about prudent<br>investment<br>which is focusing on government's<br>investments<br>is sort of taking us in the direction of<br>having more confidence in the quality<br>of government spending government<br>investing<br>and<br>for me that's an empirical matter as<br>well as a theoretical ones it's largely<br>an empirical one and you've got to<br>actually stand back not only in new<br>zealand<br>but in the world and ask whether the<br>quality<br>in our goods and services and our<br>investing actually comes from public<br>sector it comes from the private sector<br>but anyway that i think shapes obviously<br>the way a government will think about<br>fiscal policy<br>because ultimately<br>taxation has got to finance the spending<br>and the spending is essentially as i say<br>a decision is between how much is done<br>by public and private sectors<br>one thing people may be interested to<br>know is that the new zealand tax system<br>is lauded by the oecd and is lauded by<br>most overseas commentators<br>it's it's held in high regard<br>and i think it deserves to be held in<br>that regard because of the effort that<br>past governments have put into getting<br>tax policy right<br>and that's that's as much about the way<br>policy is done as it is actually about<br>the policy<br>settings<br>and um in 1994 sir iva richardson<br>gave us the generic tax policy process<br>which puts a heavy emphasis on shaping<br>tax policies<br>on consulting with the public sector<br>effectively seeing tax policy as a joint<br>venture between government<br>and the in the private sector<br>in recent times and from time to time<br>all through the various government<br>regimes there's an inclination<br>sometimes for governments to<br>put that process aside<br>and for politicians to rush into<br>legislating<br>tax policies<br>with minimal consultation<br>um as a general observation um looking<br>back on that empirically those policy<br>changes tend to be<br>criticized the most or they tend to be<br>the weakest and i think it's it's<br>imperative for us to keep lobbying our<br>politicians to ensure that they do in<br>fact do the proper consultation and<br>and in the context of the pandemic and<br>in the context perhaps of this seminar<br>we're sort of thinking about<br>interventions to smooth business cycles<br>monetary policy i think is rightly seen<br>as the lead steer on doing that because<br>fiscal instruments are more medium to<br>longer term and they are more clunky and<br>lumpy<br>and tax policy for example is not<br>something<br>that you can necessarily<br>put into the system at short term to do<br>immediate and short run impacts<br>probably the closest you come to that<br>ability and tax policy is tax rate<br>setting but as far as tax base<br>determination is concerned that is not<br>uh something that delivers fiscal<br>consequences immediately<br>and also tax policy on the base design<br>is far more suited to long-run<br>thinking and long-run<br>settings<br>and you can observe that empirically let<br>alone theoretically<br>so take the last reformed debate on the<br>calendar review about our capital gains<br>tax<br>um matter um i think that demonstrates<br>that that's a tax reform that not only<br>takes time in terms of its shaping and<br>thinking on the government side but also<br>on getting it politically past the<br>electorate and getting the public by and<br>that those sorts of massive tax reforms<br>involved<br>in the new zealand system we have<br>uh<br>gst and income tax as our substantial<br>tax-based sources<br>and it's hard to imagine that those two<br>tax bases leave gaps in<br>covering the gdp and indeed<br>in the mcleod review which i chaired<br>some years ago now in 2001<br>uh when we proceeded very closely on<br>examining where gaps in the tax base<br>were and we had kind of evaluated the<br>prospect or the attractiveness of taxes<br>by reference to the gaps that they might<br>plug all the gaps that they may fill<br>and the general view at that time was<br>that there weren't that many there were<br>some but there weren't that many<br>material<br>tax gaps now i for one am not<br>a strong advocate for miracle countries<br>putting in myriad taxes and tax types in<br>their tax base<br>the the duality the duopoly of gst and<br>fantastic mass tax bases that work in<br>partnership to give us the broad<br>coverage that we need and it's given<br>rise to the mantra of the broad base and<br>the low rate<br>which is very again i think very hard to<br>beat<br>as a practical concept that delivers<br>revenue results and stable results<br>in tax cyclical terms to a government so<br>i think really the burden of proof is on<br>anybody advocating<br>supplements to those taxpayers<br>indeed to the extent that government<br>once more tax<br>they've got the right<br>opportunity in respect of those bases<br>and there has been ongoing debate about<br>whether the gst at 15 is high enough or<br>indeed 39 top marginals on the income<br>tax base at the personal level is high<br>enough 28 for the corporate base<br>um and those arguments go in both<br>directions<br>but i i think that we need to preserve<br>the assets that we've got in our tax<br>policy and the broad-based low-rate<br>mantra i think is part of that<br>um<br>i was just going to sort of touch on the<br>fact also that revenue taxes are there<br>to raise the revenue to finance the<br>government spending it's important to<br>realize that the taxes as incentives or<br>taxes as instruments to modify behaviour<br>really belong to a different category of<br>taxation thinking<br>the tax taxes that we live with in new<br>zealand most people think about our<br>revenue taxes<br>and the design of those taxes is the<br>exact opposite<br>of the design of<br>corrective taxation or behavioural<br>taxation<br>revenue taxes are actually designed not<br>to alter behave<br>because if they do alter behavior the<br>deadweight losses associated with them<br>go up<br>and it's really the province of the<br>corrective or the pagodian tax<br>you know that narrowly focuses on<br>correction of behaviour or addressing<br>market failure and i would argue also in<br>the context of a pandemic or fiscal<br>pressures<br>that that dichotomy between revenue and<br>corrective taxes is important to<br>maintain and not conflate people<br>shouldn't think<br>really about revenue tax design as an<br>instrument to modify behaviour<br>i'll just conclude my remarks on<br>inflation i'm very really pleased that<br>the commentators to a person all<br>recognize that inflation is one of the<br>most evil things that can inflict be<br>inflicted on an economy and in the tax<br>system it is also evil<br>in the sense that can lead to over<br>taxation when you've got negative real<br>interest rates and we're still taxing<br>nominal interest people are being over<br>taxed in terms of economic income<br>and the same goes for other categories<br>of assets on the flip side liabilities<br>get a tax break in inflationary times<br>um<br>and obviously fiscal drag which is<br>people being taxpayers being pushed<br>higher into higher tax brackets<br>is great for government but actually<br>also bad for the private sector and bad<br>for tax rates<br>in general and it's important to ensure<br>that governments don't become addicted<br>to inflation because<br>inflation can give it more tax revenue<br>and can also depreciate<br>it's dead obligations one way of<br>actually paying off<br>uh government debt in the future really<br>is to inflate it away so<br>there are<br>addictive features of inflation that our<br>fiscal masters need to basically ensure<br>that they don't become addicted to<br>so hopefully those are a few comments<br>and foods for thought that um that are<br>useful and<br>i'll pass over back to you<br>liz and and to oliver<br>thank you sir robert again some<br>useful reminders of the fact that we<br>have uh revenue raising and pigouvian<br>type taxes but we move straight on now<br>thank you less and uh good morning<br>everyone<br>when in fact it's not a good morning it<br>is a completely different world<br>from the one we had until last week ago<br>the world in which we woke up this<br>morning<br>and i find it difficult actually to talk<br>about fiscal policy on a day when<br>russian tanks are rolling towards kiev<br>and when the global order the order of<br>post 1989 is really now coming to an end<br>in front of our eyes<br>makes it really hard to talk about<br>fiscal policy but maybe that makes it<br>all the more important to talk about<br>fiscal policy in the world we are facing<br>i look a little bit tired that's<br>probably because i spent most of last<br>night glued to the television watching<br>everything from cnn to bbc to a lot of<br>german channels just trying to figure<br>out what is happening<br>because i think what we're seeing really<br>is<br>a completely different world emerging<br>with a lot of threats and risks and<br>uncertainty<br>and that makes it even more difficult of<br>course than to talk about alternatives<br>and opportunities for fiscal policy here<br>but i think we have to we have to talk<br>about all of this we have to talk<br>about these global affairs about these<br>global risks<br>i don't think you think we do that<br>enough in new zealand i mean the<br>dominion posts today at least had the<br>conflict on the front page<br>but you had to go to page 19 to find any<br>more reports on it and i find that<br>dangerous for us in new zealand because<br>i think these global affairs they matter<br>they will impact us here they will have<br>an effect on fiscal policy and all sorts<br>of other policies as well<br>and when we talk about geopolitics of<br>course russia is not the only threat<br>that we see<br>we could equally talk about china and<br>china's ambitions not least in south<br>china sea<br>we should probably still talk about<br>north korea we should keep an eye on<br>iran there is no lack of geopolitical<br>risks today<br>and it's not just geopolitical risks of<br>course we have big economic risks fiscal<br>risks big<br>monetary risks as well<br>we see the rise of inflation worldwide<br>and i think for some regions that's<br>probably a challenge even bigger than a<br>challenge it is to us<br>i think of europe i think of the euro<br>crisis which never really finished which<br>has always been kept under reps but i<br>think which is coming back now<br>with the rise of inflation in europe<br>because the european central bank will<br>find it really difficult<br>to balance the needs of some of the eu's<br>member states with the need to fight<br>inflation and bring europe back to price<br>stability<br>we could talk about the potential of a<br>global financial crisis and actually my<br>colleague bryce wilkinson just published<br>a report on that<br>late last year where we basically came<br>to the conclusion<br>it's probably a matter of when and not<br>if we have a global financial crisis 2.0<br>and then of course oil and energy prices<br>again<br>linked of course to the geopolitical<br>events we're just witnessing now um we<br>have seen the oil price rise above 100<br>um just in the last 24 hours it's<br>probably not the end of the story so<br>there are plenty of risks threats<br>uncertainty<br>when i said that makes it really<br>difficult to talk about fiscal policy<br>alternatives and opportunities<br>the question i have for new zealand is<br>are we prepared are we prepared for any<br>of these developments that we can see<br>overseas<br>and when i say are we prepared i mean<br>not just as an economy<br>dealing with it but are we prepared with<br>our institutions are our institutions<br>prepared and more specifically<br>are our economic institutions prepared<br>the government's institutions that<br>actually guide us through fiscal policy<br>economic policy and monetary policy<br>and on that one<br>i have grave doubts and i just want to<br>explain that with a little example which<br>i find telling it is just this tiny<br>little example but it tells you the<br>problem in a nutshell<br>there was a job advertisement from<br>treasury just a couple of weeks ago and<br>treasury which starts itself as the<br>government's key economic advisory<br>agency was looking for a senior analyst<br>for its economic strategy team<br>now this is what treasury wrote into the<br>job at<br>it specified that quote an economics<br>background is not essential<br>and instead treasury told us about the<br>successful candidates the following<br>they were looking for someone with good<br>critical thinking skills through<br>constructive debate with people in<br>relationship skills comfort working at<br>pace and dealing with ambiguity probably<br>quite important these days<br>they were looking for a superb<br>communicator with eq the ability to<br>motivate and influence others and<br>interested in mentoring and supporting<br>other team members<br>the<br>job advertisement and really this was<br>all about the candidate was so bland and<br>so general really anyone could have<br>applied probably even my nine-year-old<br>son<br>if treasury has given up on even asking<br>for economic expertise we shouldn't be<br>surprised that we won't get it anymore<br>and this is a development that has<br>worried me since i arrived in new<br>zealand i've been here for 10 years now<br>and one of my very first meetings<br>actually was a joint workshop organized<br>by treasury and vic<br>where they were trying to develop the<br>first bits of the living standards<br>framework frankly i've been following<br>this now for 10 years i still do not<br>know what a living standards framework<br>is supposed to achieve that a proper<br>cost-benefit analysis couldn't and<br>actually i think it is worse i think the<br>living standards framework is<br>distracting us from what a proper cost<br>benefit elizabeth would actually tell us<br>it makes it very difficult to balance<br>different competing objectives it<br>actually prevents the kind of economic<br>rigor that we would expect from a<br>treasury that we're no longer getting<br>i think this living standards framework<br>is leading us astray it is a pentagram<br>it doesn't really add any value and it<br>distracts<br>and when i listened to the treasury<br>secretary's speech yesterday we saw some<br>examples of that she of course went on<br>about the living synods framework how<br>important it was in the development of<br>well-being policies well<br>actually what i would like to see is<br>some economic rigor we're not getting it<br>because treasury for a long time has<br>actually neglected appointing properly<br>qualified economists<br>not saying that that's the case for all<br>of treasury there are pockets of<br>excellence within treasury we look at<br>the housing team within treasury they're<br>doing a really good job<br>but overall i think the quality of<br>advice coming out of treasury has<br>diminished<br>i also founded telling yesterday that in<br>the treasury secretary's speech we<br>didn't hear anything about global risks<br>it was left to the question and answer<br>session and someone asked about that and<br>then she gave us a statement but it<br>actually didn't feature she talked a lot<br>about fiscal forecasts but all the big<br>risks the kind of risks i mentioned<br>earlier didn't even feature and i think<br>the worst bit of it was actually then<br>when she talked about climate change<br>policy and the ets<br>she asserted without giving us any<br>evidence that we needed policies beyond<br>the ets when in fact the ets actually<br>covers our emissions now we have a<br>binding cap in emissions trading scheme<br>and a lot of the policies that you try<br>to introduce on top of it actually are<br>completely superfluous they don't have<br>an effect on the total amount of<br>emissions all they do is they distort<br>carbon prices when actually we need<br>carbon prices to guide our investments<br>in the future<br>so i think that particular economic<br>institution in our<br>government<br>scene doesn't really help us it is not<br>providing the kind of advice that would<br>even allow us to identify opportunities<br>and alternatives and sadly the same<br>could be said for the other big<br>institutions in the country i think the<br>rbnz has come under a lot of flag<br>recently for its management and i must<br>say i have lost count of the number of<br>deputy and associate governors of the<br>army and said no employees<br>and again we have a qualifications<br>problem recently the rbnz appointed a<br>governor and associate governor<br>with responsibility for macroeconomic<br>policy but that person didn't have any<br>economic spectrum whatsoever<br>or look at the monetary policy committee<br>actually the economics background would<br>be a hindrance now being appointed to<br>the monetary policy committee because<br>they have actually specified that if you<br>have any previous research in<br>macroeconomic policy monetary policy or<br>any research interest for future<br>research you do not qualify because they<br>see<br>see it as a potential conflict of<br>interest well by that standard you<br>basically couldn't employ anyone<br>currently serving on the monetary policy<br>committees or boards of governors of the<br>big central banks in the world i find it<br>ludicrous and again<br>the treasury secretary was asked in the<br>q and a session about that yesterday<br>where the treasury provided any advice<br>on that and basically dug that question<br>and finally where we previously got some<br>decent advice<br>on economic policy apart from treasury<br>the productivity commission i read the<br>latest speeches from the chair of the<br>productivity commission almost<br>apologizing for the task of his<br>organization namely to lift our<br>productivity our actual economic output<br>standards and make new zealand a much<br>better more highly productive economy i<br>sometimes read these speeches coming out<br>of the protcom as an apology for the<br>task for which it was initially<br>instituted<br>so<br>really going back to the theme of this<br>conversation<br>fiscal policy alternatives opportunities<br>i actually see a lot more risks and<br>threats and uncertainty arising from<br>international economic circumstances<br>monetary circumstances<br>the state of the banking system globally<br>but also of course and especially on a<br>day like today from the geopolitics<br>there are too many risks hanging above<br>us risks that we in new zealand of<br>course cannot even<br>properly um influence<br>but we should be prepared for them we<br>should actually take this as our<br>challenge now to make sure that new<br>zealand can weather the storms which<br>will come our way i think it is not a<br>question of whether we will get a new<br>global financial crisis of whether we<br>will face<br>problems in international energy markets<br>it is a<br>question of just when this will occur<br>and how bad it will be<br>i wish new zealand to be prepared for<br>that but in order to prepare for this<br>properly we need all our economic<br>advisory agencies all our core<br>institutions of government in this field<br>to be prepared for this to have the<br>intellectual firepower to have the level<br>of information necessary to really<br>confront these challenges because<br>otherwise i think we will not be<br>prepared and we will head for very very<br>dangerous and difficult times in new<br>zealand thank you<br>thank you oliver and i i second the<br>issues in relation to the ukraine and<br>also to global risk<br>um we're sort of running quite quickly<br>out of time here i could briefly<br>summarize where i think we're at<br>mark uh holmes was um<br>giving um opportunities in terms of<br>longer-term investment with relatively<br>low interest rates so robert was i think<br>um giving us a very clear picture that<br>he believes that the<br>the the the tax base the tax system is<br>is well placed in new zealand and well<br>respected<br>and oliver<br>um reiterates some of the issues that<br>sharon zollner was talking about in<br>terms of risk<br>um sharon made it clear that we can't<br>reduce risk totally risk will be<br>everywhere but whether we are actually<br>um aware and prepared for global risk<br>again oliver talked in relation to<br>an issue that has been coming through a<br>number of the the questions here in<br>relation to whether our institutions are<br>sufficiently well placed to be able to<br>deal with what are a series of quite<br>unique problems for new zealand the<br>issue of a growing deficit<br>and one where we're facing global risks<br>and i have questioned here with several<br>questions from<br>those tuning in<br>relating to how fast<br>we should be thinking about closing this<br>deficit and also the relationship<br>between<br>the monetary<br>um<br>system<br>and the fiscal system where in the past<br>fiscal policy has always been playing<br>really the back room role<br>um and as robert suggests<br>um this is a medium and longer term role<br>monetary policy through the reserve bank<br>had a tradition of being very<br>transparent that transparency seems to<br>be<br>a little more opaque there seems to be<br>more uncertainty and the question i ask<br>all of you for the quick reply here is<br>the extent to which moving forward<br>we need treasury and the reserve bank to<br>make it plain to everyone what their<br>plans are for the future<br>many of<br>our people have never lived through<br>inflation they have never lived through<br>the consequences of inflation<br>and for me trying to teach inflation to<br>18 and 19 year olds over the last 10<br>years you know basically that's when the<br>laptops open and the cell phones open<br>because they don't know what i'm talking<br>about<br>so are we prepared as a as a nation are<br>our institutions sufficiently robust<br>well qualified and powerful enough to<br>deal with this crisis<br>postcovid<br>so rob do you want to answer that ques<br>put a view here<br>sure thanks<br>um<br>look the um<br>the the question starts with the fiscal<br>deficits and how and the speed with<br>which we should remove them um<br>one thing to go back to perhaps by way<br>of example i'm going all the way back to<br>the muldern administration which was<br>possibly the peak of where our fiscal<br>books were in the worst state of<br>disorder and the switch of government<br>through to the longi labor government<br>and<br>that took a long long time to work<br>through the system but asset sales for<br>example were a big component of it<br>essentially you know that fiscal<br>accounting and management really has the<br>the capital streams of<br>of capital spending and capital receipts<br>by the government<br>um but also has the tax component and<br>and what i would call the revenue<br>receipts and economics economic national<br>income accounting that capital revenue<br>distinction is not emphasized<br>but as a practical matter it needs to be<br>emphasized but ultimately<br>the government needs a plan in my<br>opinion it needs a plan on fiscal<br>management in terms of deficit<br>management which is medium term<br>it's not sensible um to actually make um<br>precarious and abrupt changes and tax<br>design in my opinion<br>to actually um<br>try and get rid of deficits in the short<br>run<br>and and the most important lever for the<br>government in medium-term fiscal<br>management is spending<br>um<br>the<br>spending comes first and financing of<br>that spending comes second<br>it's not the other way around you don't<br>um you don't try and you know spruce up<br>a tax system that can suck out<br>as much revenue as possible from the<br>economy and then actually have a spend<br>up in the in the in the next phase of<br>that<br>i think australia provides an<br>interesting example for example<br>australia<br>total total government spending in total<br>taxes all governments<br>has been about five percentage points<br>below the new zealand statistic<br>and i've often wondered why that is and<br>having spent seven or so years there um<br>in the last decade i came to realize<br>that actually their tax system has got<br>so much bad design in it particularly<br>the gst<br>that it's actually starved off the<br>government from from from revenue<br>and that starvation of revenue has<br>caused the spending by that government<br>to actually<br>um to be less than would otherwise be<br>and<br>i i've never actually been an advocate<br>for designing bad tax policies or in<br>fact strangle government spending<br>although i've been tempted to from time<br>to time to advocate that position<br>but australia is a living example of<br>that happening<br>but anyway hopefully those remarks are<br>uh i don't trust that i'll pass over to<br>my colleagues i i've been given a wrap<br>here so um does anyone want to take the<br>mark i think you're on nude mark you're<br>mute<br>mark<br>yeah i'll just briefly um<br>say something on the speed of<br>removal<br>uh reducing the um<br>the deficit and of course the you know<br>the these geopolitical events um<br>can be crucial and i think economies can<br>be more vulnerable in a crisis with high<br>debt than low debt and um depending on<br>the perceived magnitude and length of<br>the crisis and how it's going to impact<br>new zealand<br>then of course that yes that would<br>constitute the case for<br>um definitely bringing debt to income<br>down<br>for the economy um and so the economy<br>can be a better place when if the crisis<br>hits um<br>fully but i i still you know still<br>believe in prudent investment is is a<br>way forward as and when the time would<br>be right<br>oliver i fully agree with everything<br>that mark just said and i would add to<br>that that of course new zealand has a<br>specific um challenge to deal with as<br>well we know that this country every few<br>years uh gets a natural disaster to deal<br>with whether it's a volcanic eruption or<br>an earthquake or tsunami<br>we have to be ready for these events<br>because they are a feature of our<br>geography and geology<br>and therefore i think it is only prudent<br>to reduce that levels to a level<br>that would allow us in the future to<br>deal with them when they occur again<br>because again they will occur at some<br>stage we just have to be ready for them<br>well i'd like to to wrap up here by<br>thanking all of you mark<br>sir robert and oliver for<br>some very insightful observations and<br>comments moving forward<br>and now i think that we're going to have<br>a short break<br>uh this discussion could go on for much<br>longer<br>but we have to to move on so thank you<br>very much from<br>everyone here at the economics forum<br>and um yes please keep thinking and<br>posting about these ideas thank you<br>thanks liz<br>again a fascinating session and a theme<br>there about preparedness uh is oliver<br>highlighted and many of us have been<br>glued to screens<br>watching what's happening in the<br>are wondering how that will play out<br>and i think there's an enormous theme<br>here and come right through the morning<br>that we don't know what will be around<br>the corner we don't know what risks are<br>coming so preparedness in a financial<br>sense but also in a capability sense<br>it's fundamental we're going to go to a<br>break now it'll be about 10 minute break<br>we'll be back at 11 15 with a perennial<br>kiwi favorite housing<br>obviously some of the other policies<br>that we've touched on this morning have<br>big impacts on that it's a huge part of<br>the economic life in new zealand and<br>then<br>the last session of the day will kick<br>off at 12 on the global picture another<br>fantastic panel<br>and it's never been a more important<br>time to discuss that and we'll wrap up<br>just before one o'clock so we'll see you<br>gifted<br>the name raupapa papa<br>to the to the management school<br>and<br>for me<br>terapapa just fits<br>this<br>space<br>ro papa<br>as a single word<br>means to arrange<br>things and put put things in there in<br>there in their place<br>so that they make sense<br>but that doesn't mean that they stay<br>there<br>they can be rearranged<br>and they can be reworked<br>so as a<br>as a simple word<br>that<br>management<br>in<br>that word is<br>it fits<br>it's amazing to look at the management<br>school and its achievements over the<br>last 50 years to imagine this place as a<br>couple of small pre-fair buildings on<br>the side of a hill in the hillcrest to<br>all of the achievements since right from<br>its founding<br>the waikato management school taro papa<br>has been focused on innovative<br>management and business education that<br>started with the innovative four-year<br>bachelor management studies bms degree<br>right through to being the first<br>management business school to launch a<br>digital business qualification<br>the first in new zealand and<br>one of the leaders in the world and<br>incorporating sustainability right at<br>the center of our strategy through to<br>the first in new zealand to achieve the<br>triple crown accreditation which places<br>us in the top 1 of business schools<br>globally and then even more recently in<br>the last six months<br>named is number one in new zealand for<br>business and economics and in the top<br>125 in the world in times higher<br>education rankings so when you look at<br>that and then look at the impact our<br>research has had and look at the impact<br>our alumni have had more than 24 000<br>students from prime ministers to ceos to<br>erie leaders to community leaders to<br>just fantastic people going out and<br>making a difference in the community<br>do<br>do<br>so<br>right<br>kia ora and welcome back to the new<br>zealand economics forum here at the<br>university of waikato i've just taken a<br>short break even in that time i<br>connected with a couple of friends and<br>colleagues offshore and obviously all<br>watching the unfolding events in ukraine<br>and closely so it's very sad situation<br>that's happening there<br>we are moving into the home stretch of<br>our two-day forum here we have two<br>sessions left uh the first is on the<br>housing and infrastructure and then the<br>last will be that session on<br>globalization so for the housing<br>infrastructure session again a very<br>strong panel and i'm going to hand it<br>across to my colleague professor frank<br>scrimmager of the university of waikato<br>frank over to you<br>thank you matt<br>it's great pleasure to have our panel<br>here today<br>dominic stevens<br>leilani free and brad olsen all<br>well-known people with long experience<br>in housing and infrastructure<br>so we'll go um straight into the<br>presentations before we do that i just<br>make the one observation uh that last<br>week housing in new zealand made the<br>economist so<br>we must be doing something right or<br>something terribly wrong uh<br>to get there so let's see what the<br>insights are<br>we'll start off with uh dominic then go<br>to leilani<br>welcome dominic<br>thanks very much frank for the for the<br>introduction um i do think it's fair to<br>say that over the past 20 30 years the<br>rise and rise and rise of new zealand<br>house prices has<br>has really bested many economic<br>forecasters and policy makers in new<br>zealand and i think as a profession we<br>owe it to the public of new zealand to<br>confront that fact<br>and to think through well what is it<br>about the housing market that is<br>behaving a little bit differently to<br>perhaps what we've thought um i thought<br>jim bulger said it really well in his<br>sort of closing remarks yesterday he<br>talked about the definition of insanity<br>it's trying to do the same thing over<br>and over again and expecting the same<br>different result<br>so i think the the dominant idea<br>that has pervaded thinking on the<br>housing market in new zealand for the<br>past 20 years is that the ups and downs<br>of house prices or mostly the ups are<br>related to physical supply and demand of<br>dwellings on the ground<br>so whether house prices go up or down<br>people talk about migration construction<br>activity<br>the relationship between the two or<br>perhaps construction costs<br>and i really think that idea um it has<br>it really has theoretical merit but it's<br>really been challenged by the data on<br>the ground<br>most obviously over the past two years<br>we've seen zero net migration um to new<br>zealand so very very low population<br>growth and absolutely booming<br>construction activity highest in decades<br>and yet the rate of house price<br>inflation has been the highest on record<br>off a really big base<br>more subtly if we look back over 20<br>years<br>well if it was really about supply of<br>dwellings and the housing shortage or<br>there is a housing shortage if that was<br>the cause of rising house prices well<br>it should have caused rents to rise too<br>but actually over 20 years back to 2001<br>rents are up in real inflation-adjusted<br>terms 47<br>house prices have more than trebled so<br>the difference between the two is a<br>completely different order of magnitude<br>increase between prices and rents and<br>indeed it's the house price to rent<br>ratio and the blowout in that ratio that<br>needs explaining<br>construction sector again probably has<br>played a role but in real inflation<br>adjusted terms again since 2001 uh<br>purchase of new dwellings part of the<br>the the consumer price index which<br>measures the cost of putting a dwelling<br>on empty land up 67 percent house prices<br>up 240 in real terms so again it most of<br>the increase is actually in land not<br>construction and then finally there's<br>just no concordance between where<br>the<br>population growth and housing shortages<br>have been in new zealand and the house<br>price inflation actually there are four<br>territorial authorities that have had<br>population decline over 20 years and<br>they're among the biggest house price<br>increases in the country<br>so i think there's there's definitely<br>some real challenges to the way housing<br>markets have been thought about and i'm<br>pleased to say that at the treasury and<br>and elsewhere that how we think about<br>housing markets is changing<br>we heard the reserve bank governor just<br>today say that or acknowledge that the<br>biggest cause of rising house prices<br>over the past 20 years in new zealand<br>according to their research is a global<br>decline in interest rates at the<br>treasury we are putting more more focus<br>on interest rates and our house price<br>forecasting of course you know interest<br>rates affect asset prices of all stripes<br>they drive them up relative to the<br>underlying stream of earnings and<br>new zealand houses are no exception<br>but the really interesting thing is why<br>drops in interest rates lead to higher<br>house prices not not lower rents and<br>that comes down to the supply of land<br>opposed to the supply of dwellings<br>as i say the traditional thinking on the<br>housing market it's it's got really good<br>theoretical foundations it's it's it's<br>based in the traditional housing model<br>which which actually at its core<br>has an assumption that there's plentiful<br>land available for development<br>so if there's something like an interest<br>rate decline comes along and it's<br>permanent well that could drive house<br>prices up but it'll drive them above the<br>cost of getting some more land off of<br>farmer at the edge of town<br>and plus the cost of actually putting a<br>house on that land that'll create a<br>supply response<br>and that'll bring house prices back down<br>again<br>and actually that model predicts that a<br>permanent decline in interest rates<br>would lead to lower rents over the long<br>run<br>actually that traditional model is<br>unable to<br>explain<br>persistent changes in house prices<br>relative to incomes it can't<br>uh and that's why people forecast<br>typically think that houses a housing<br>market will come to its senses and come<br>back down when they when they see house<br>prices go up or that<br>people think about well there must be<br>something wrong with the construction<br>response because because supply hasn't<br>kicked in<br>i think the theoretical or the the<br>theory of that model is fine but the the<br>underlying assumption of plentiful land<br>just is not new zealand's reality and<br>has not been new zealand's reality for<br>quite some time<br>i think in fact in new zealand the<br>ability of urban areas to obtain land<br>for development either out or up so to<br>use land in a different way either out<br>or up<br>is is really very constrained so<br>restrictions on the supply of land<br>really change the way you think about<br>housing markets and i'll just just get<br>you to imagine for a second a world<br>where land was completely restricted<br>well in that case price of land will<br>have nothing to do with the value of a<br>farm at the edge of town<br>um rents will be anchored<br>to<br>what tenants can pay so incomes and<br>physical supply demand of dwellings that<br>sort of thing<br>but if an interest rate decline comes<br>along well that'll drive house prices up<br>as the net present value of the future<br>flow of rents goes up so<br>you know standard asset pricing theory<br>but here's the key<br>what will happen is that that decline in<br>interest rates or the value of it will<br>get captured<br>in the value of land if land is really<br>very restricted in supply<br>so what you'll see is land prices going<br>up as well as house prices and the gap<br>between the two won't change<br>meaning no real change in incentive to<br>build new dwellings<br>no supply response necessarily and no<br>not necessarily any change in in rents<br>and in fact that's a general idea that<br>if land is really restricted in supply<br>then changes to things like taxes even<br>construction costs will be captured in<br>the value of land and will not<br>necessarily alter<br>the incentive to build new dwellings on<br>that land and will therefore not<br>necessarily alter rents and i think<br>that's why we're seeing house prices<br>respond to interest rates um not not<br>rents<br>now i do want to<br>qualify a couple of things here um i've<br>just sort of presented a really extreme<br>case of completely fixed land supply and<br>contrasted it was completely abundant<br>neither is the real world actually<br>reality lies somewhere in between and<br>what we need is more thinking and<br>research on<br>where new zealand sits on that spectrum<br>and i also just want to qualify that i'm<br>not for a second saying that physical<br>supply and demand doesn't matter at all<br>for the housing market of course it does<br>it really matters for rents for example<br>it's just that<br>we can tell its importance by what has<br>happened to rents we can see say for<br>example christchurch after the<br>earthquakes you saw<br>supply of housing relative to the<br>population really dropped away you saw<br>rents rise actually more than prices<br>supply response kicked in rents and<br>prices both underperformed the rest of<br>new zealand that's what a market looks<br>like experiencing a shortage of<br>dwellings and it just doesn't explain a<br>lot of what's happened in the in the<br>wider new zealand housing market over 20<br>years although it does explain<br>particular places in particular times<br>okay so restricted land supply or<br>falling interest rates in the context of<br>restricted land supply is the biggest<br>thing going on in the new zealand<br>housing market how does that<br>affect our policy thinking i think first<br>of all we're using<br>the relative role of interest rates<br>relative to migration and physical<br>supply demand is changing in our<br>forecasts we're putting more weight on<br>interest rates<br>secondly your policy solutions are going<br>to really zero in on<br>the effective supply of land the ability<br>of urban markets to access or change the<br>use of<br>either change the use of land within the<br>urban area or access land on the outside<br>and that's what i'm hoping um leilani<br>will will talk about and that's why<br>we've got infrastructure connected to<br>housing in this in this topic outside of<br>that i think that the idea that changes<br>get uh absorbed into land prices means<br>we should revisit tax<br>when we think about the housing market i<br>think successive tax working groups have<br>feared that taxing housing would cause<br>would reduce the incentive to build new<br>houses causing a reduction in supply and<br>an ultimate increase in rents and again<br>i i think that's<br>abundant land supply thinking and new<br>zealand's reality is actually different<br>to that<br>um i think we should really focus our<br>attention on what drives rents both<br>because if you're locked out of the<br>housing market rents are really what<br>matter to you they matter for well-being<br>but they're also<br>really important for thinking about well<br>if we're thinking of of housing kind of<br>prices are being affected by their<br>investment value well the underlying<br>stream of rents really matters<br>and lastly i think we need to zero in on<br>what the problem actually is in new<br>zealand<br>it's actually interest rates have fallen<br>so far that it's actually really very<br>affordable to service a mortgage even at<br>very high house prices now<br>relative to incomes<br>what's changed is the affordability of a<br>deposit it's exceedingly difficult on<br>new zealand incomes to to muster a<br>deposit to buy a house that is the<br>actual nub of the issue and it's causing<br>people to be locked out of the market so<br>let's zero in on that and maybe consider<br>what would help people overcome that<br>essentially liquidity constraint<br>of mustering a deposit<br>thank you dominic<br>you've put a number of issues on the<br>table and<br>so<br>so thank you for the opportunity to join<br>you today and to the university<br>of waikato and my customer management<br>school for bringing us all together<br>um<br>so<br>the topic of housing and infrastructure<br>is so broad i think we could go in a<br>number of directions and i appreciate<br>that john has sort of zeroed into a<br>couple<br>um but i also appreciate that the q a<br>section of this panel may indeed go into<br>more broader areas<br>i did want to kind of start with the<br>qualifier i'm not an economist so i'm<br>not going to come up the discussion from<br>that perspective so apologies to those<br>that i hope that i do<br>i am however fortunate enough to be a<br>homeowner i'm fortunate to be a home<br>investor and i am currently a renter as<br>well<br>and in my day job my focus is on the<br>delivery end enabling housing and<br>infrastructure to be delivered and<br>bring that perspective to<br>the policy development and<br>implementation activities of government<br>so kind of what is my perspective i<br>start quite at a high level we've all<br>got these really basic needs and<br>expectations when it comes to housing<br>and infrastructure<br>home is a base where we and our whanau<br>can feel safe and warm<br>and infrastructure that kind of connects<br>us to all the places that we want to<br>either work live play<br>um<br>and or<br>access the services that we're looking<br>for to be our personal services that we<br>need<br>and so don mentioned you know we've got<br>some growing population challenges and i<br>would add into it changing citizen<br>expectations on how we want to actually<br>access those places that we want to live<br>work and play and get services from<br>um so those couple of factors have kind<br>of created this step change and how we<br>need to think about housing and<br>infrastructure so i fully support john's<br>perspective that we need to really quite<br>think differently<br>as we sort of lean into those headwinds<br>that are creating the challenges for us<br>but in particular from my perspective<br>it's about how we facilitate and enable<br>that access<br>to uh housing and infrastructure that's<br>important<br>and unfortunately you know there's no<br>silver bullet no one-size-fits-all kind<br>of solution as you all know um many many<br>drivers that are impacting access and<br>enabling um they're very they're diverse<br>they're interdependent and dom's touched<br>on a<br>few of those<br>um<br>what also is clear from my perspective<br>is that there is a need for the whole<br>ecosystem to align to deliver all of<br>these solutions that are grounded really<br>really chronic around it enabling people<br>to get access to housing and<br>infrastructure<br>so there's a real role for the private<br>sector you know as employers for jobs<br>banks access to financing businesses in<br>terms of access to construction and<br>supply the supply side and there's<br>definitely obviously a role for<br>government in the regulatory policy and<br>funding<br>side so again supporting predominantly<br>access on this from the supply side<br>so<br>um as don mentioned you know it's pretty<br>clear from government perspective that<br>restricted land supply is one of the<br>biggest underlying drivers of the high<br>cost of housing and i'd also suggest<br>that it's also quite a constraining<br>factor in our ability to provide<br>infrastructure needed to service the<br>populations<br>um<br>the populations and the civil and the<br>regional and city centers when um when<br>they need it<br>so<br>and what what can government kind of do<br>is as i said i'm kind of focused on a<br>delivery end um<br>agree completely with dominic's position<br>that the focus has been on<br>creating a greater ability to free up<br>land supply for housing and<br>infrastructure and also a greater<br>ability to enable development now and<br>into the future so things like planning<br>for more growth um up and out is<br>probably the way to think about that<br>um greater land use and infrastructure<br>integration and we've seen a few<br>recent government announcements that are<br>very much around<br>integrated housing and infrastructure<br>projects coming forward<br>wider use of infrastructure corridor and<br>site protections<br>to facilitate and maybe reduce the<br>impact of<br>land price inflation when and if<br>government's ready to make those sorts<br>of investments<br>creating a sort of a more enabling<br>regulatory environment that provides<br>the ability to not just look at how we<br>implement um<br>change or planning of getting planning<br>approvals through e0 but also the types<br>of uh teams that are going to be needed<br>in the in those types of planning<br>approvals need to kind of be facilitated<br>easier<br>um<br>and then infrastructure funding and<br>financing i think it relatively speaks<br>for itself and then the other sort of<br>sleeper is probably the capacity and<br>capability of the whole ecosystem<br>to deliver and i'll touch on that one a<br>little bit later<br>a little bit<br>so<br>um<br>the focus there for what we kind of what<br>we are doing is<br>in terms of enabling access<br>and facilitating some of those outcomes<br>i just mentioned<br>a lot of focus in that planning space<br>the key signature because<br>activities around the appeal of the<br>resource management act i know you're<br>very very very familiar probably with<br>what that act is trying to achieve<br>taking one act breaking it into three<br>but very interrelated pieces of<br>legislation<br>one that focuses predominantly on the<br>natural and built environments it's<br>going to be the primary piece of<br>legislation that replaces the rma<br>and it's focused predominantly on<br>land use and environmental protection<br>it'll work in tandem with the sec the<br>second act the strategic planning act<br>that's to set out an approach to<br>long-term and strategic planning<br>around how we use land and the coastal<br>marine area in new zealand and then the<br>final act<br>is around climate adaptation as we<br>lean into the complexities of what we<br>need to do to really address the complex<br>environment that we need to operate<br>operate in to meet<br>the the needs and commitments for the<br>country in terms of climate change<br>so taking all together those three acts<br>of kind of<br>being brought<br>to the fore now<br>and really trying to support<br>that enabling role in the regulatory<br>space particularly the planning space<br>and facilitating easier<br>decision making to unlock<br>a sort of land supply<br>as<br>big piece and definitely a big lever and<br>i think an important lever but it's not<br>sufficient allowing to address the<br>issues so infrastructure provision and<br>funding is also going to play a really<br>key role in enabling the development<br>that the player that acts sets up<br>us to be<br>to to hack a step change in the way we<br>address these issues but um we do yeah<br>we do need to<br>realize that it's not the silver bullet<br>it's not a silver bullet so one<br>initiative and that's happening at the<br>moment is the there's an iff act 2020<br>and it was it was established to enable<br>new funding and financing for<br>um the provision of new infrastructure<br>for housing and urban development so not<br>the big eye infrastructure you know not<br>the big chains and schools and hospitals<br>but predominantly their small<br>infrastructure and in my opinion the<br>most important infrastructure to<br>facilitate increased land access for<br>housing infrastructure like<br>telecommunications water sewerage and<br>local roads so that's you know a sort of<br>initiative that government's pushing<br>forward with um to try and and<br>acknowledges and realizes that enabling<br>infrastructure for land development is<br>just as important as having the land<br>itself<br>um<br>i note that um<br>even if we do get some of those enabling<br>factors that i just mentioned are sorted<br>and in place<br>as i mentioned earlier it's the capacity<br>and capability<br>of people businesses and government that<br>will be just as important to<br>make sure that we address the challenges<br>in front of us that ecosystem that i<br>mentioned earlier you know getting that<br>aligned and working together i<br>appreciate that is a whole topic in and<br>of itself but as you all know we're<br>already seeing headwinds particularly<br>say in the construction space of the<br>constraints that are impacting<br>our construction sector in particular<br>around capacity and capability<br>and unless we kind of find a way to<br>address those i think that they will<br>also<br>impact the speed at which<br>newly available land can be developed<br>and released to support housing and<br>infrastructure development<br>so i'll probably leave it there and<br>hopefully i've given a couple of<br>perspectives of how i see the challenges<br>and shared you know what government's<br>kind of doing to try and enable<br>greater access to land and<br>infrastructure and look forward to the q<br>a part of the panel discussion<br>thank you leilani<br>we will go to bread but before we get to<br>bread<br>i just encourage them to be brief you<br>know it's really good if we can get some<br>q a at the end so brad we look forward<br>to your um sharp and incisive insights<br>kia ora uh frank and kyota and good<br>morning everyone i i will keep them<br>brief i think uh dominic made a<br>an important<br>starting point very clear<br>around that need to acknowledge where<br>we've gone wrong previously and i think<br>to expand that<br>certainly new zealand as a country i<br>think needs to admit the failure that<br>we've had when it comes to<br>infrastructure because really that is at<br>the key of where we've gone wrong and<br>and just how uh we've got ourselves into<br>the position that you're telling young<br>new zealanders that they need to find<br>you know potentially quarter of a<br>million dollars and a deposit to get<br>into a house<br>because the well-being implications are<br>clear<br>new zealand for a long time has really<br>suffered with that under investment in<br>our infrastructure and our ability to<br>both<br>provide fix and maintain uh the the<br>network assets that really keep us going<br>and i think we need to consider as well<br>what we do differently in that space our<br>analysis of infrastructure across the<br>country<br>and internationally has shown that new<br>zealand has under-invested relative to<br>our international peers over a number of<br>years<br>we've invested at a rate<br>below the likes of the us certainly<br>below canada and australia and a touch<br>below the uk as well and it shows uh in<br>wellington we have pooh every now and<br>then running down the streets we have uh<br>hospitals uh you know which which are in<br>disrepair schools as well and i guess we<br>must ask ourselves how we let ourselves<br>get to that position how did we not<br>figure out that things were breaking<br>around us until we put a media spotlight<br>on it and it suggested importantly going<br>forward we must have a much we must have<br>a much better focus on uh asset<br>management because as we've seen uh and<br>as domex pointed out the supply of land<br>and the supply of of uh<br>housing becomes secondary to that supply<br>of land and actually being able to do<br>something with that land change its use<br>around is critical yet at the moment we<br>are spending most of our money when it<br>comes to network infrastructure on asset<br>maintenance and repairs we're not<br>actually putting a huge amount into<br>additions and it does really highlight<br>leilani's point around the need to<br>better fund our infrastructure i do want<br>to make make a point around supply and<br>demand and note that although we all see<br>nearly 50 000 consents a year in the<br>headlines and talk about how much<br>building we're doing we in our mind at<br>infometrics do highlight that we're<br>probably only just right now this uh<br>year starting to build uh more than we<br>are needing to that huge increase in<br>supply is important but relative to<br>where we've previously been we've<br>underbuilt for over a decade we're only<br>now starting to get into a better<br>position and as uh politicians of both<br>sides have often made the point you<br>cannot live in a dwelling consent you<br>can only live in a dwelling and in our<br>estimates we're still a few years away<br>from actually getting things in a better<br>position<br>by that time we will likely have uh more<br>pressures coming onto the housing market<br>so<br>the point around there being no silver<br>bullet from ailani was very well made<br>and and my submission there would be<br>that we should throw the kitchen sink in<br>it<br>just finally i want to discuss why uh<br>housing actually matters dominic touched<br>on this from a well-being point of view<br>but i think it is important to go to a<br>very basic level uh for for new<br>zealanders that if you don't have a home<br>uh that is comfortable if you don't have<br>uh something that that you can go to<br>sleep uh in at night<br>you aren't going to be a very productive<br>member of society you're not going to<br>worry about going to work and and being<br>your productive best you've had a<br>rubbish night's sleep you're not<br>comfortable you're cold and miserable so<br>really<br>homes and housing does set the<br>foundation for new zealanders and we<br>know that those at the bottom end have<br>been left behind since 2016 lower<br>quartile rents have increased by 34 but<br>medians have only increased 29 so we<br>know that squeeze at lower end has come<br>through quite clearly now with 25 000<br>new zealand households on the waiting<br>list<br>and as we move forward that difficulty<br>that we find particularly for young new<br>zealanders becomes a huge<br>intergenerational uh challenge where<br>we've said we've made decisions as a<br>country<br>that young people will be screwed over<br>on the housing market as we go forward<br>that is the decision that new zealand<br>has made and it does suggest we need to<br>rethink all policies that we have on the<br>books<br>and i'll leave in and the point that<br>dominic has very well isolated in the<br>point that i made at the start is around<br>that the difficulty when it comes to<br>housing relates mostly now to the<br>deposit requirement and i remember quite<br>fondly my grandfather uh late<br>grandfather noting the potential of<br>government support back when he was<br>young state advances corporation the<br>capitalization of<br>child benefit and similar at the moment<br>uh i will save my own kiwisaver i get a<br>thousand dollars<br>a year uh sorry a thousand dollars at<br>start and 500 a year from the government<br>uh chump change really compared to what<br>uh other support has been seen<br>previously in new zealand<br>we do need to rethink that entire model<br>the entire ladder and the entire amount<br>of state support that we provide because<br>for too long it's been focused on<br>subsidising the continued rollover of<br>housing through the accommodation<br>supplement and similar we haven't built<br>enough state homes we haven't used the<br>crown's balance sheet to actually invest<br>properly in infrastructure and maintain<br>the basic bones of new zealand we are<br>paying the price for it unless we make<br>those changes now we will continue to<br>suffer and young new zealanders will be<br>locked out of that future increasingly<br>thank you<br>thank you very much<br>so one of the key themes which comes<br>across all presentations is the supply<br>of housing and coming back to the supply<br>of land<br>and<br>my question is<br>the recent legislative<br>changes the changes to try and increase<br>capacity to dwell in the major urban<br>areas to what extent is that going to<br>alleviate things or or<br>is it not<br>we know that many councils haven't<br>complied with national policy statements<br>on urban developments um<br>you know what<br>what can be done to increase this land<br>supply what are the next uh steps so<br>uh dominic do you want to go first<br>followed by leilani<br>yeah and i think that'll be a good<br>combination i'll talk to the sort of<br>where are we on the spectrum and i'll<br>let leilani talk about what what could<br>actually drive a difference um actually<br>the answer frank is we don't know um<br>there's<br>a number of years ago there were some<br>metrics generated on um sort of relative<br>availability of land but they've sort of<br>fallen into disuse<br>so<br>i'm on i'm chairing a housing technical<br>working group which is a collaboration<br>between ministry of housing and urban<br>development reserve bank of new zealand<br>and the treasury and one of our key<br>research topics is to<br>is to<br>try to understand you know i mentioned<br>that in reality we're somewhere between<br>this world of<br>fixed land supply and a world of<br>abundant land supply and we're somewhere<br>in the middle and different parts of new<br>zealand will be in different places<br>and i'd really like to get a metric of<br>where we are on that spectrum<br>and where different parts of new zealand<br>are<br>and then secondly i'd like to um do<br>further research on how far that<br>spectrum can shift<br>my sense<br>is that uh is that actually<br>it can shift but it's slow really slow<br>and more institutional than simply you<br>know let's build this piece of<br>infrastructure here it's it's it's deep<br>down in the in the institutions<br>um um of the nation but<br>that's my sense let me hand over to<br>leilani to give give more of a sense on<br>it is a big question in and of itself<br>and it's multi-faceted i suppose in<br>terms of answers i think um i think one<br>of the things that the rma acts trying<br>to do is actually what is the plan what<br>is the what does the plan for our cities<br>and our regions need to look like to<br>support future generations and<br>the population growth<br>and that's not an it sounds easy to do<br>but it's actually not because it does<br>also need there for you know the number<br>of partners to come together to to sort<br>that out if i kind of reflect on my<br>experience in new south wales because<br>for me coming to new zealand nine months<br>ago there were some elements that i was<br>recognizing in the challenges and issues<br>that we are having here<br>that<br>resonated with me from when i joined the<br>new south wales government about 12 10<br>years ago<br>so similarly infrastructure deficit<br>after 16 years of non-investment um<br>things the issues that brad raised in<br>his talk um<br>housing affordability going up<br>system not really you know<br>some livers in the system not quite set<br>up and strong enough to support the<br>ambitious agenda that government had<br>which was to adjust housing<br>affordability and infrastructure one of<br>the things that they did was they<br>started to look at how do they support<br>regional and urban planning what is<br>needed<br>where is it needed where do people want<br>to live work and play<br>and so those factors came into saying<br>well then and then what what do we<br>actually do to address that<br>um and so at the moment we<br>we don't quite house that baseline<br>um so we have a number of tools like<br>we're getting money to get together<br>we're getting a you know planning acts<br>and everything um<br>being amended and addressed<br>to um<br>to work out<br>to make it easier uh once we get to<br>figure out what we have to do to make<br>that happen but we still don't quite<br>understand or have we have a clearer<br>picture at quite transparent levels<br>where people want to live work and play<br>um<br>and what therefore do we need to<br>facilitate in terms of infrastructure<br>and then what does that mean in terms of<br>housing and what does that mean in terms<br>of<br>um do we<br>intensify or do we go out and spread so<br>there's a there's a lot in there and i'm<br>not really giving you any direct or<br>short answers on it<br>but i think that what we have is that<br>some some pillars that need to be<br>delivered and i agree with brad it's<br>going to take some time to get those<br>things in place<br>before we can actually see what's<br>possible<br>thank you<br>i i guess just adding to and i will be a<br>bit more definitive and and very brief i<br>i think the changes we've made recently<br>uh are very much a step in the right<br>direction and importantly starts to<br>change our frame of reference because<br>our prior settings our prior laws had a<br>very hands-off approach it was you can<br>develop but there are constraints and<br>and sort of how you develop what we<br>don't care about but there are settings<br>and frameworks in place recently though<br>we've said actually no we're more<br>permissive we're a bit more forthright<br>the country as a whole through our<br>political leaders are saying yes build<br>build don't don't not build build go go<br>on and do it and in fact for those of<br>you who didn't want to build sorry your<br>choice has gone because your property<br>rights at current are impinging on<br>people's future property rights and<br>there is more fairness over generations<br>that need to be introduced so i think<br>that's important because i do think it<br>starts to shift the psyche we're now in<br>a position where we're saying yes to<br>things more than we're trying to find<br>reasons not to go ahead but that does<br>need to continue and i speak<br>particularly in the local government<br>sector uh we're in indeed in my mind the<br>incentives still aren't strong enough to<br>do it because for a new development uh<br>you go along to a council and and it's<br>not often that you<br>necessarily find someone with a bottle<br>of champagne saying you want to build<br>let's go let's let's let's have fun<br>and importantly that's because again for<br>a council additional work yes means<br>eventually additional income but<br>importantly additional expenses to start<br>with and that focus like i said from an<br>infrastructure point of view has been<br>very very skewed towards maintaining<br>what we've got because we let it get so<br>run down for such a long time that we<br>cannot easily fund expansion and so it<br>does suggest that alongside the changes<br>we've made to infrastructure funding<br>recently we need to go further and again<br>i start to ask if we need to be much<br>more forthright instead of<br>financing uh you know for some large<br>developments<br>the taxes that that people have have<br>paid in recent times and people will pay<br>in the future could well allow us to get<br>ahead of the ball if we are courageous<br>brad um i'd like to go back to you again<br>to to continue this<br>my concern is uh local government uh<br>funding of infrastructure um<br>it doesn't seem to be happening at a<br>speed<br>that we would expect and and so my<br>question to you is is what can be done<br>to to speed that up um<br>and and get some momentum in this space<br>oh i think a lot i think at the moment<br>we also probably need to recognize the<br>temporal issues that we face around the<br>country there is a lot of stuff going on<br>and we simply can't do it all we're<br>pushing up prices what i do suggest<br>though is we need to have a much better<br>focus on prioritization<br>economics is about scarcity we know<br>there's only so much resource in a<br>certain given period of time to do stuff<br>what is it that new zealand decides is<br>the important thing to pay for right now<br>is it sports stadiums convention centers<br>and similar is it hospitals or schools<br>is it roading is it apartment blocks is<br>it office blocks we don't know we make<br>no decisions and importantly we<br>have not in my mind put the right sort<br>of pricing incentives uh in there<br>because the pricing metrics matter but<br>going forward i think as well as that<br>you sort of see the difficulties that we<br>face you you look at<br>the the challenges that local government<br>has also from a purely political point<br>of view now economists don't often<br>touch on the political view but<br>realistically we must remember it and so<br>i think the the direction setting that<br>central government has provided is<br>important uh but there is an increasing<br>need in my mind that if the government<br>takes uh the money from local government<br>in the form of gst in the form of<br>building consent fees and and similar<br>over time there is a need to emit some<br>of that back uh to find a better funding<br>stream than we currently have at the<br>moment we uh<br>the government uh provides a subsidy for<br>roads but if a local council wants to<br>fund some water pipes themselves or any<br>other sort of infrastructure sorry<br>that's on you we are not in my mind<br>having a full discussion about the<br>financing that could be done i think the<br>infrastructure financing uh that came<br>through in 2020 is an important step in<br>the right direction more of that please<br>thank you<br>so we've got six minutes left and um<br>i'm going to allocate you two minutes<br>each and and i've got um two questions<br>for you to answer um<br>in your two minutes so<br>what's the most important thing to be<br>done in the infrastructure space going<br>forward<br>question number one and question number<br>two<br>what else is is your priority what's<br>your first priority in um<br>leading to a an improved housing market<br>and improved housing outcomes for new<br>zealand citizens<br>so we'll start with you dominic<br>if you don't mind i'll start with the<br>second question just in case i run out<br>of my two minutes but it's it's the tax<br>system<br>so the tax system in new zealand<br>favors ownership of assets that yield<br>capital gain rather than<br>taxable income<br>housing really firmly fits into that<br>category<br>i'm concerned about the equity<br>considerations there there's those<br>locked out of the housing market don't<br>access those those uh tax benefits while<br>those who do have capital access the tax<br>benefits um secondly i think that that's<br>again in a in a restricted land supply<br>world<br>what we expect is that tax benefits for<br>housing manifest in higher land prices<br>so i think changing it there would would<br>affect land prices more than more than<br>rents will supply<br>infrastructure only point i'll make is<br>um i think i think brad's right that<br>this needs to be a centralized<br>effort<br>so basically if you fix up you know<br>availability of land in one part of new<br>zealand what will happen is people will<br>flood to that part and quickly<br>exhaust that availability of land so it<br>really does need to be a nationwide<br>effort um so that we don't get this<br>cross city sort of equilibrium<br>so i guess i think<br>i'm going to take some liberties on the<br>infrastructure one because i think<br>there's two for me there is that<br>coordinated planning um aspect which is<br>related to what tom's uh what um john's<br>just talked about<br>but i think we can have all the plans<br>and we can have a little enabling uh<br>legislation and access and everything<br>but if we don't have the capacity to<br>actually make it happen<br>then it's all for naught so i think<br>there needs to be this<br>now<br>while we're getting all of the other<br>things sorted some real focus on how<br>we're going to attract the skills the<br>capability and capacity and experience<br>to actually deliver and to position<br>ourselves to be ahead um rather than<br>catch up which is the point that brad<br>raised um so in terms of housing and<br>what's my priority at the moment it's<br>just getting those reforms the work on<br>the reform management act through<br>to look at the the the infrastructure i<br>i think we need to have asset management<br>planning going forward uh and looking<br>back and and the ability probably for<br>the infrastructure commission rather<br>than taking everyone's capital plans and<br>and sort of noting them to be much more<br>directional and say no<br>we don't need these resources right this<br>second in this area we need to redeploy<br>our resources into<br>pipes or whatever it might be in<br>taranaki because that's where we see the<br>greatest need and also therefore the<br>funding that's attached that from<br>government<br>i think in terms of priorities i i'd<br>agree with dominic in terms of the tax<br>system i feel like at the moment uh we<br>are screwing over younger new zealanders<br>and we are increasing the wealth gaps as<br>we move forward new zealanders will only<br>be able to get into property if they<br>inherit it going into the future and for<br>those families that don't already have<br>property they will continue to be locked<br>out we either face that problem front on<br>and soon or we wreak<br>the havoc that we continue to see and<br>exacerbate the challenges for future<br>thank you very much<br>so um we've made a lot of progress there<br>are still issues in play i<br>put on the table this this whole<br>discussion about uh the replacement to<br>the resource management act<br>is it coming fast enough<br>is it uh dealing adequately with the<br>challenges i think i think that's<br>another further challenge for us<br>there's lots of questions come through<br>on the the slider we haven't been able<br>to uh<br>get to them all but<br>it does seem that the<br>supply chain issues are exacerbating the<br>problems that we're facing in the short<br>run and and one of the questions is how<br>soon we will get through to the other<br>the other issue that's uh coming up is<br>the current uh<br>lending requirements uh<br>associated with the the banking system<br>your interpretation of the recent<br>finance legislation<br>and i wonder whether dominic i'll give<br>you the chance for uh for a final<br>observation on that matter<br>yeah i think i um agreed with the way<br>the reserve bank um looked at this i<br>think those lending requirements can<br>have a fairly transitory effect<br>on on housing markets if they are at all<br>i i think the real reason that house<br>prices have started falling and the<br>fallen over december and january is that<br>there was a really sharp lift in<br>interest rates around september that's<br>about the normal timing in new zealand<br>we've seen it before big change in<br>interest rates you see a shift in the<br>housing market and it's it's coming to<br>pass<br>um<br>yeah i think<br>thanks<br>thank you very much thank you to the<br>three of you for your contributions<br>today very helpful and we look forward<br>to this<br>conversation continuing over the coming<br>months and hopefully better outcomes in<br>infrastructure<br>and housing markets i'll hand it back to<br>thank you frank and uh thanks to the<br>team<br>dominic and brad and as as you're<br>highlighted and brady said quite<br>eloquently it's it's not housing for<br>housing's sake it's the impact that that<br>has<br>on the way that people live their lives<br>look we've come to the last session of<br>the 2022 new zealand economics forum<br>and of course there's there's no bigger<br>topic than the global in the<br>geopolitical situation today<br>so i'm going to hand across now to<br>stephen joyce who will moderate a panel<br>we have a fantastic panel of speakers<br>here for this topic and i'll hand over<br>to stephen for the last panel session<br>thanks<br>thanks matt uh cured everyone and uh<br>well what a session that we're walking<br>into uh with everything that's happening<br>around the world in the last 24 hours<br>and in particular in europe with russia<br>invading the ukraine and pretty much as<br>we speak tanks heading across<br>the ukraine countryside<br>which probably does change slightly the<br>tenor of our<br>discussion today<br>uh<br>obviously we want to be cognizant of of<br>what's happening there we do also want<br>to get the more macro issues and i'm<br>sure our panel will do that for us<br>uh and and the impact of of what we're<br>seeing on on<br>on<br>decades-long trends like globalization<br>and so on<br>anyway we have three excellent panelists<br>for this discussion firstly<br>from the university of new south wales<br>professor gigi foster professor of<br>economics who's joining us live from<br>sydney thank you very much gigi from<br>doing that<br>we have<br>rodney jones principal economist and<br>analyst at wigram capital advisors<br>and we have the honourable tim groser<br>former minister of trade and climate<br>change issues but also a long-standing<br>diplomat with quite a lot of experience<br>in around the world including in europe<br>now we're changing the batting lineup<br>slightly today on what we've planned i<br>will get gigi to continue to go first<br>tim's going to come in second and<br>probably do a bit more specific<br>stuff around uh russia and ukraine and<br>and the impact of that although gigi<br>you're most welcome to to to start with<br>that and then rodney is going to look a<br>bit more specifically at the china<br>situation and and perhaps some lessons<br>um through there now um i've talked to<br>all the panelists ahead of time we're<br>going to do sort of five to seven<br>minutes uh and uh each and again the aim<br>of the exercise is to have a good<br>discussion for about half of our time<br>and so there's a chance to sort of<br>lay out the the key arguments and then<br>we'll come back to them so gigi thank<br>you very much for your time and over to<br>you<br>my pleasure thanks for having me and uh<br>thanks for uh forging ahead with this<br>conference despite the uh the online and<br>in-person uh you know debate that was<br>going on for a while um so i want to use<br>my five to seven minutes to focus on the<br>things that uh i think are most<br>important for the antiquities going<br>forward we'll speak a little bit about<br>russia and ukraine but the main thing<br>that i think is important to bear in<br>mind is that the last two years have<br>been a a catastrophic policy ball drop<br>they have been uh very very<br>bad for the economies and the welfare of<br>both australia and new zealand and so<br>the best thing that we can do going<br>forward for our economies is to exit the<br>coveted madness as quickly and uh sort<br>of methodically as possible while uh<br>reassuring people that this is the right<br>direction to go in because we have<br>basically um paralyzed people with fear<br>and and really hurt them<br>in terms of their perspective on uh<br>covet and other health problems and we<br>need to help them to recover some sense<br>and to be able to then<br>activate their their consumption<br>investment behaviors as they need to be<br>activated in order to grow our economies<br>going forward so um the first thing is<br>to drop all of these restrictions about<br>kovid that are limiting business and<br>consumption activity all over the<br>antiquities uh well again reassuring<br>people and i think that some use of<br>things like on-the-spot testing or um<br>you know other kinds of uh<br>very easier i suppose methods to<br>reassure people are much better than<br>border restrictions and<br>mass mandates or the kinds of mandates<br>um that that are really distracting from<br>what new zealand and australia needs to<br>work on going forward so that's the<br>first thing second thing is that as part<br>of our covet policy um response<br>we have seriously disrupted many of the<br>industries that australia and new<br>zealand have relied upon in the past and<br>that really play to our comparative<br>advantages immigration uh tourism<br>education the arts and entertainment of<br>course but you know all of these these<br>things uh maybe with the exception of<br>arts and entertainment rely heavily on<br>borders being open and uh people being<br>able to freely move about and and<br>of course as well<br>and so um from my perspective and i<br>think that the politicians here in<br>australia do see this i'm not sure<br>whether that's the case in new zealand<br>but i think we have to refocus on on<br>making our countries um an appealing<br>place to work study do business uh and<br>live<br>and so we need to uh try to get rid of<br>the the brand uh image that we have at<br>the moment of uh you know very scared<br>populous uh with a lot of control<br>response to anything that's potentially<br>going to be threatening uh not very much<br>risk tolerance and uh and not a very<br>friendly place to be if you happen to<br>get caught here when there is a crisis<br>because you will not be uh treated very<br>well you'll be turfed out as our<br>temporary migrants and ours our students<br>were at the height of coven so i think<br>we need to repair our brand damage<br>basically repair the image of the brand<br>of australia and new zealand and uh try<br>to encourage as much uh immigration as<br>possible and and tourism and students<br>coming back and all of that if we don't<br>do that see the issue is not that the<br>economy is necessarily going to sink in<br>the short run in fact we see here in<br>australia that the unemployment rate is<br>very low um you know the gdp doesn't<br>seem to be you know taking as much of a<br>knock as people that expect it although<br>that's always<br>an arrears number that we that we<br>collect and release here um but it just<br>doesn't seem that there's the the<br>evidence yet in these kind of standard<br>statistics that we've really hurt<br>ourselves um but in the long run without<br>immigration we will grow more slowly we<br>will become more parochial and there is<br>a danger of being more xenophobic um and<br>i think other countries in the world<br>like for example scandinavia um the uk<br>who are dropping those restrictions will<br>not suffer those longer-run effects and<br>so over the longer run australia and new<br>zealand risk being left behind so that<br>to my mind is the main danger um very<br>briefly the other things that i'm<br>looking at the labor market is a very<br>interesting uh phenomenon at the moment<br>um people are re-evaluating where they<br>want to be in the labor market they're<br>changing their hours up there's<br>obviously been so much disruption that<br>new choices are possible sometimes new<br>discoveries of technology have been made<br>which i think will stick<br>that's fine but uh i don't think we're<br>going to get back to the levels of<br>productivity that we were looking at<br>pre-covered um for another probably a<br>couple of years um natural resources of<br>course is a huge issue for the<br>antiquities for australia particularly<br>in iron ore for example for new zealand<br>i suppose you have your sheep um and a<br>lot of other things and so i keep an eye<br>on the irr price and of course that<br>comes down to how much construction is<br>happening overseas including in china um<br>and um yeah the debt repayment um that<br>of course is going to have to happen<br>which will crowd out other kinds of<br>expenditure i worry that that may uh<br>also you know drag the economy down and<br>human welfare down with it now on russia<br>and ukraine um i from my perspective is<br>a bit of a useful distraction at the<br>moment for us to be thinking about<br>something other than covid i wish it<br>weren't a war<br>um but i think that maybe it will help<br>some people to recover some sense about<br>what's actually important and uh and and<br>speed our exit from the the covert<br>madness i think i'll leave it there<br>okay<br>thank you very much gigi um i'm sort of<br>sensing that you think um some of the<br>health responses overwhelmed um the<br>economic response uh for covert we'll<br>come back to that definitely<br>uh let's go and talk a little bit more<br>specifically then about<br>russia and ukraine and the impacts<br>globally<br>we we have seen uh dramatic scenes uh in<br>the last 24 hours and i'm sure we'll see<br>more in the next 24 hours tim grosser is<br>a former diplomat and uh foreign a trade<br>minister who is very familiar with that<br>part of the world tim<br>um i know i asked you late this morning<br>whether you could change your comments a<br>bit to give us a bit more of that flavor<br>i hope<br>i didn't catch you too much by surprise<br>no not at all stephen uh and uh thank<br>you for inviting me on this panel um i'm<br>going to start with an anecdote which i<br>think has certainly become very topical<br>because i happen to be in moscow at the<br>time the russians<br>started this process of trying to<br>redraw the map of the ukraine<br>so<br>i had<br>a long-standing relationship with<br>essentially russia's chief trade<br>negotiator when i was still um wto<br>ambassador and chairman of the global<br>agriculture negotiations in geneva<br>and i wrote a think piece for his boss<br>elvira naviolino who was then the<br>minister of commerce and now she's the<br>governor of the central bank of russia<br>but she's going to have her hands full<br>in the next two to three months<br>so i said to them look you'll eventually<br>get into the wto and join that global<br>system but that's only half the game<br>why don't you do what china has done<br>take this small apec economy in new<br>zealand and create your first fta<br>and to my astonishment they said yes<br>so um<br>two years later it took a long time to<br>negotiate i'm up in moscow i do a deal<br>with an outstanding russian uh<br>intellectual<br>um julio who is now in jail for eight<br>years on trumped up corruption charges<br>by president putin<br>and i<br>finished the negotiation in moscow and i<br>texted the prime minister john key and<br>said do you mind if i<br>miss the cabinet meeting next week<br>because i need to be here for a signing<br>ceremony he texted me back and said no<br>problem congratulations see you on your<br>return<br>so i went out partying in moscow with<br>the ambassador and his team<br>didn't read the news and on monday<br>morning i turned on my ipad to find that<br>the lead item in the new zealand<br>main media was prime minister orders<br>trade minister grosser to return from<br>moscow immediately<br>and i'm thinking well what the hell has<br>that got to do with his last instruction<br>what i did not realize<br>was that they had in the previous 48<br>hours started this process of<br>dismantling the ukraine<br>and it was obviously in both the prime<br>minister's eventually my view not going<br>to be a good look if a small western<br>country and member of the five eyes<br>arrangement was seen in pravda front<br>page smiling signing a trade russia's<br>first ever trade agreement with an apec<br>economy after they had done this<br>now i think we<br>need to understand that that process of<br>integrating russia into the global<br>economy via both<br>the wto<br>which took them i think 12 years to<br>negotiate their way in there and then<br>eventually into apec and the agreements<br>that are sort of associated with the<br>apec framework<br>is part of the broader picture we're<br>debating today which is the post-war<br>global<br>era<br>and we shouldn't forget for example that<br>the<br>resignation of the<br>pro-russian president of ukraine in 2013<br>i think<br>uh early 2014 yanukovych<br>was actually sparked by his refusal to<br>sign a comprehensive trade agreement the<br>eu<br>so i'm not the only analyst that is<br>commenting on these terms<br>the raster of essentially three pillars<br>of globalization in the post-war era<br>one is respect for sovereignty and in<br>particular not no attempt to redraw the<br>lines of<br>boundaries established after the war<br>because it has trapped ethnically<br>comparable people behind different<br>political configurations<br>the second was<br>to enforce peace through u.s lead<br>deterrence and security agreements and<br>the third was inside each sovereign<br>country was you know a movement towards<br>respect respective human rights peaceful<br>transfer of power democracy largely<br>defined<br>so all of these things are part of the<br>post-war global era and they're all<br>under pressure<br>and<br>my story about the collapse of this fta<br>is i think a sign of the times that we<br>are under and i'm very concerned about<br>it stephen uh<br>primarily because i'm a great devotee of<br>uh robert kagan the the so-called neocon<br>although i don't find that label<br>particularly revealing<br>who<br>whose recent book about two years ago<br>the jungle grows back it the very title<br>suggesting globalization<br>is slowly under massive pressure<br>and fundamentally it all comes down to<br>the united states<br>all of this was underwritten by the<br>massive relative power of the united<br>states as kagan points out many of his<br>writings liberal ideas have been around<br>since the enlightenment for centuries<br>the only reason they succeeded after the<br>catastrophe of two european initiated<br>wars in the 20th century was because for<br>the first time they had massive relative<br>power to enforce those liberal<br>principles<br>and now we see the united states in real<br>trouble they withdrew from tpp when i<br>was ambassador new zealand ambassador in<br>washington i witnessed that disaster of<br>american policy<br>they<br>are occupying essentially an empty seat<br>approach in the wto and i spent 11 years<br>of my life in the wto and the gat before<br>that<br>and i think we're under a lot of<br>pressure frankly on the institutional<br>frameworks of globalization i think it's<br>not about collapse um<br>i could elaborate on that if you're<br>interested but i do think we need to<br>recognize that we are living in very<br>uncertain times<br>and i'd like to finish my introductory<br>comments by referring to a quote that<br>anyone has ever been a student of<br>globalization would have come across<br>it's a very famous quote from keynes<br>it's brilliant um polemic the economic<br>consequences of the peace when he said<br>something like i don't have the quote in<br>front of me but an english gentleman<br>this is could prior to the outbreak of<br>world war in 1914 sit in his bed and<br>drink coffee from plantations and salon<br>order more investments in argentinian<br>railways and so on so in other words<br>the pre-world war one globalization era<br>and of course it all came down to a<br>shattering collapse as the consequence<br>of war<br>because at the end of the day<br>globalization is a political construct<br>yes it's driven by technology and by<br>profit maximization and the search for<br>business opportunities but it runs<br>through the arteries of certain<br>political understandings keeping a<br>global trade and payment system open and<br>they right now stephen are under a lot<br>of pressure<br>okay thank you very much tim will come<br>back<br>and address<br>where they might go uh with with the the<br>russian invasion of ukraine and what<br>might happen next<br>um and in fact our next guest may<br>comment on that as well uh rodney jones<br>is the principal economist and analyst<br>at william capital advisors he has a<br>long history of working in china for a<br>range of clients<br>and has been a a<br>china watcher for a long time but i also<br>understand his much broader knowledge of<br>the of of the<br>geopolitical world as it relates to<br>relates to business and economics<br>rodney thank you for joining us<br>these are indeed strange times what's<br>your current take<br>i've spent the morning revising or since<br>4am ukraine time yesterday revising what<br>i was going to say um<br>like what tim grossa said that keynes<br>quote i i come at globalization as an<br>economist<br>and so and again look back at that 1870<br>to 1913 period where you had free<br>movement of capital labor and goods and<br>that all came to a crashing end in world<br>war one<br>and<br>then<br>you know part of the reason the uk went<br>back on the gold standard in in the 20s<br>was to try and recreate that world<br>in a sense we're in a similar position<br>now<br>um<br>and i that's the what framing we've been<br>going thinking in terms of and the<br>pandemic represented that sort of break<br>now it appears either you know that<br>seems a bit trite given what's happened<br>in ukraine in the last 24 hours<br>and so it kind of reminds you of that<br>hemingway line that you go back up two<br>ways<br>you know slowly then suddenly or<br>gradually then suddenly<br>and that has been the path of<br>globalization it's been<br>this slow unwinding and it was<br>fascinating to hear the story from from<br>tim about crimea and new zealand's fda<br>living in china at that time<br>you know that 2014 2015 period was a key<br>turning point in terms of the south<br>china sea<br>the rise of xi jinping<br>the the move away from collective<br>leadership<br>and<br>that culminated in 2017 with the end of<br>term limits and she now this october<br>or more likely you're going to have a<br>third term<br>and so<br>what we've got is now we've got this<br>accelerated<br>downward shift in in globalization um<br>i'll come to some of the domestic<br>economic factors that are working in<br>china but first of all i think just<br>because of what's happened we need to<br>turn to kind of russia china and i think<br>when the history of this period is<br>written<br>february 4 or loom is a large date and i<br>think it's a small country like new<br>zealand<br>that's a very challenging<br>what's happened is extremely challenging<br>that was a joint statement from between<br>putin and xi jinping<br>where two things stood out from that<br>um<br>they're friends with no limits<br>and there's no forbidden areas well<br>within three weeks<br>putin has tested that new definition of<br>friendship<br>there was some hope yesterday<br>uh that she had been caught off guard by<br>this and that we would see some<br>commentary from the initial foreign<br>affairs in china<br>unfortunately when wangi spoke to lavrov<br>he kind of affirmed<br>that<br>china was sorry that russia was acting<br>on legitimate concerns around security<br>and so<br>this means today<br>and i've always never done this in<br>public so this is the first time i've<br>spoken in public on this is that we do<br>need to now start talking about taiwan<br>but in some ways<br>the the joint agreement<br>and then immediately followed by an<br>invasion of ukraine<br>establishes the caused valley from from<br>china's perspective and so<br>this is you know somewhere but you know<br>we haven't wanted to go that we're going<br>to have to start thinking about those<br>dynamics and that's something new<br>but for right now that's still in the<br>future<br>um but it's it's a new factor in the<br>equation that i've tended to downplay<br>myself<br>domestic factors have been um really<br>important there's this<br>the factors around the economic policy<br>in china that we associate with kind of<br>diminishing globalization and that's<br>common prosperity we've seen the claim<br>down on the tech and property sectors i<br>i kind of i tended to remain quite<br>optimistic<br>until<br>you know early last year that china<br>could still grow fast even with this<br>shift towards going prosperity<br>that's now misplaced so we've kind of<br>got the market in retreat in china and<br>the state-owned enterprises on the march<br>and the state with that advancing<br>so<br>we've got internal dynamics in china<br>that means it's turned it turns inwards<br>and as gigi kind of referred to kovid<br>has had this turning inward effect in a<br>lot of countries including new zealand<br>australia but particularly in china and<br>the xero covet keeps that in play we now<br>have an opportunity to kind of exit our<br>policies over coming months<br>in china as we see in hong kong they're<br>doubling down on zero covered and what<br>we're seeing in hong kong just a brief<br>comment there<br>they've used cyanovac for about half<br>their vaccinations and it looks like<br>it's it's completely ineffective on<br>stopping transmission and<br>uh<br>maybe less effective than previous<br>studies have suggested so hong kong is<br>looking at very high death rates hong<br>kong universities to about seven<br>thousand our modeling suggests 10 to 15<br>as possible but certainly omicron's<br>going to spread<br>and it's likely to spread into the<br>mainland and so we've now heading ahead<br>in china to a year dominated by covert<br>policies by zero covert<br>which means we have another year of<br>training inward<br>so it's<br>um<br>a lot to absorb um but that's you know<br>my initial comments<br>thank you very much rodney thank you to<br>all our panelists for that initial<br>comment<br>so we're doing a sort of a bit of a<br>stock take um<br>listening to the three of you one thing<br>that's quite apparent is<br>the absence of us leadership in this<br>most recent period in different ways<br>and<br>uh<br>and and<br>particularly in the around the around<br>the uh the world the world order the the<br>wto for example<br>uh and<br>and uh you'd have to say in the last 24<br>hours i mean i completely understandable<br>that they're not rushing to go into<br>ukraine but<br>but but again a sense of u.s impotence<br>and i and i sit there look thinking<br>about that and thinking well gosh<br>russia's about the 12th largest economy<br>in the world these days it's smaller<br>than italy it's not much bigger than<br>australia economically<br>and<br>and yet here they are thumbing their<br>noses at the world<br>um and and this is a the question really<br>becomes i suppose what's you know<br>has the west lost its mojo and i don't<br>mean it not mean that in terms of<br>militaristically but just in terms of<br>economically in terms of its sense of<br>direction<br>uh and<br>um<br>and and where we where are we going with<br>this over the next little where's global<br>trade going are we going to see<br>a reduction in trade or a particularly<br>in services trade uh or are we or we is<br>the west in a position that it can re<br>recover and reassert<br>these what have been global norms ever<br>since world war ii so there you go gigi<br>just a quiet couple of questions um your<br>thoughts<br>um well i mean we certainly have seen in<br>the last two years a significant<br>reduction in services even within<br>countries not<br>not<br>even covering between countries um i<br>think that the opportunity exists for<br>countries that see the writing on the<br>wall to actually move proactively to try<br>to reignite and reactivate their<br>comparative advantages in the global<br>economy which still exists and it's<br>still true that australia just is going<br>to have a comparative advantage in<br>natural resources it is going to have a<br>comparative advantage in services within<br>a western uh english-speaking<br>environment for people who want that um<br>so you know that that doesn't go away<br>the economic realities don't go away and<br>i'm you know i did study a bit of<br>politics in school but i am very much<br>constantly an economist and so i'm<br>thinking about opportunities from that<br>perspective and you see this being you<br>know taken advantage of already in place<br>where there have been reductions or<br>elimination of restrictions florida<br>texas um obviously scandinavia these<br>places are you know they've dropped<br>restrictions or they you know even a<br>long time ago they dropped them and you<br>can see just from the demographic<br>movements in the united states that that<br>that does lead to<br>more economic prosperity you know the<br>californians are moving to texas why<br>because it's better for business and<br>it's better for life there so if<br>australia and new zealand really want to<br>be on the front foot and capture what<br>remains of the good will for<br>global trade and<br>you know movement of goods and services<br>and growth and and human welfare then<br>that's what they should do that is the<br>opportunity um so use this as a as a<br>reason if you need one politically<br>because that's been the problem for more<br>than a year now it's politically it's<br>been impossible to extract uh you know<br>the story from covet and place focus on<br>something else but use the ukraine<br>situation or something with china or<br>whatever as a reason to reject all of<br>this this madness on covid and refocus<br>on what is actually good for new zealand<br>and and that doesn't just mean<br>limiting numbers of people who die from<br>covert uh so i think that's the that's<br>the opportunity and i do think that we<br>are going to see a continued long tail<br>of the cold shower effect from the the<br>kind of inward turning as i think they<br>put it but we can try to push against<br>that and we should<br>and and globalization seems to be in<br>retreat currently<br>but do<br>panel members and person bring in tim<br>and rodney do you see that as transitory<br>or are we seeing a fundamental shift now<br>um in<br>great power politics which you know<br>really new zealand rides along on the<br>way we don't get to influence that a lot<br>we we have to sort of cope with whatever<br>happens<br>well first of all going back to the<br>ukraine i mean we're all familiar with<br>the law of unintended consequences<br>and if any<br>situation merits application of that<br>principle it is war<br>so i think as<br>i thought helen clark's comments<br>yesterday were absolutely on the money<br>the russians are probing<br>the boundaries uh of the western powers<br>and<br>what will actually happen is extremely<br>difficult to forecast with even slight<br>confidence i suppose if priest i would<br>say the most likely end game is the<br>installation of a puppet regime in kiev<br>but it won't stop there<br>and the consequences for putin himself<br>in the long term could be disastrous we<br>just don't know where this is going to<br>go<br>going back to the broader framework i<br>mean globalization is i mean putting<br>aside uh covet my own i don't want to<br>elaborate on this because i'm this is<br>not my field but my own view is that<br>we're at the beginning of the next<br>phase in management of covet which will<br>involve in fact dismantling of all these<br>restrictions um it's just that this<br>needs to unfold over time it's already<br>started in denmark another place like<br>that it will happen in australia and new<br>zealand which is the we're just six<br>months too early on this point so we'll<br>get back to um living with covert uh and<br>then we confront the central problem<br>you've raised stephen which is is<br>globalization i mean globalization being<br>smashed by covert but when that is then<br>just part of the background noise as it<br>will be in my view where do we go<br>well the first thing it goes back to my<br>point about american power<br>the globalization period since 1945 as i<br>have argued like as a very conventional<br>view<br>rested on massive relative power<br>and what we've seen is the rise of an<br>alternative power center mainly china<br>that does not accept many of the<br>underlying norms<br>well i thought they did<br>but<br>the situation has changed dramatically i<br>you mentioned rodney wong i<br>i still remember<br>going up to beijing to have discussions<br>with wangi when he was minister of cross<br>straits relations to clear the lines for<br>me to begin a negotiation of a<br>comprehensive fda with taiwan<br>using of course the chinese taipei title<br>and that went very smoothly we were able<br>to do it our trade with taiwan has gone<br>through the roof as a consequence but<br>that window that was a high we took<br>advantage as a small western country of<br>the high point of globalization no<br>question about this<br>situation since then has gone backwards<br>question is<br>is it perpetually in retreat and the<br>answer that can only be<br>well don't you know the old phrase<br>predictions of my death have been<br>greatly exaggerated don't fall into the<br>trap of predicting the end of<br>globalization because there are massive<br>technological and economic forces to<br>hold many of the achievements in place<br>and if we look into my area<br>specialization trade policy that is<br>absolutely the case<br>so after the disastrous decision of the<br>united states trump i was sitting on the<br>floor of congress when he announced it<br>and it was an astonishing uh site to see<br>these u.s<br>politicians respond to him with complete<br>stunned silence<br>but<br>japan canada australia new zealand and<br>the other members have kept that show on<br>the road<br>uh united kingdom which is the sixth<br>largest economy in the world<br>uh we'll end up joining that or that i<br>have zero doubt um korea will be next in<br>so<br>with respect to the wto that's more<br>problematic and far more important than<br>cptpp because it controls roughly 60 to<br>70 percent of global commerce<br>we're now testing the limits of what<br>used to be called the bicycle theory of<br>international trade which posited that<br>is a little bit like a bicycle either<br>moves forward or it slips backwards<br>but actually the analogy is wrong<br>because there are many trick cyclists<br>who can keep this thing wobbling in a<br>stationary position for some time and<br>that is essentially what is happening in<br>geneva it's done nothing in the last 20<br>years<br>but it has not gone<br>remarkably backwards except with respect<br>to the united states withdrawal from the<br>dispute settlement process<br>so i am i think we should be overly<br>dramatic about this i have no doubt<br>we've seen the high point at least in my<br>professional life of globalization<br>but it's not going to suddenly all fall<br>away because there are very powerful<br>technological economic and political<br>forces trying to hold on to what it has<br>achieved<br>so<br>xi jinping uses this line you know the<br>east is rising the west has then<br>declined<br>but<br>as tim says that underestimates the<br>resilience<br>so<br>yes we're past i i i like that framing<br>we're past the high point i mean<br>rather than saying it's the end of<br>globalization<br>that can globalization survive china<br>tuning inwards<br>and then russia but you know russia is<br>less important<br>economically than geopolitically it's<br>china that matters economically and so<br>china turned can globalization still<br>survive<br>china turning inward and it's going to<br>be tested<br>global imbalances are going to worsen as<br>the private sector struggles in china<br>we're seeing exports rise and china's<br>kind of structural imbalances large<br>surpluses come back so we've got big<br>tests ahead of us particularly<br>you know what happens to chinese growth<br>this year and next year what happens<br>with xero covid<br>china's run a good surplus<br>services deficit now their services<br>deficit has shrunk as they don't travel<br>for education for holidays<br>it's impossible to go there to sell your<br>services<br>so<br>we can get back to somewhere<br>but for now in 2022 and in 2023 the<br>choices that xi jinping makes what<br>happens in china<br>is in some ways more important than<br>than anywhere else<br>and<br>so you know the long term is always<br>difficult i prefer to focus on the short<br>term and what we see<br>right now is that china's turning<br>inwards turning away from globalization<br>it's not over and the question then is<br>you know what happens in ukraine<br>is important what happens to russia<br>and then also what happens with china's<br>zero covert policy does the economic<br>costs the social cost of that become too<br>high so um i used to say that i i was a<br>short-term pessimist on<br>on china and long-term optimist i'm much<br>less optimistic long-term but there's<br>condition on xi jinping staying on this<br>track if we can see a change<br>then<br>better things can happen so gigi taking<br>your point about new zealand and<br>australia getting getting back to their<br>competitive advantages of course what's<br>been going on is that through this<br>period<br>commodity trade has really kept both<br>countries on their feet<br>and particularly<br>uh<br>particularly you know australia iron ore<br>but also to china right it's china<br>that's underpinning in a funny way i<br>remember as a minister<br>five years ago being told we were way<br>too dependent on china and way too<br>dependent on dairy well hello um today<br>we're a lot more dependent on china and<br>a lot more dependent on dairy<br>so from your perspective geopolitically<br>and and australia's have many more<br>run-ins with china than we have<br>diplomatically in the last last year or<br>two do you see<br>the bigger risk being the china<br>or the risk that china actually gets it<br>wrong as they as they centralize control<br>more under president xi the potential<br>for<br>things to get mucked up must be must be<br>getting higher<br>sure so i mean you're of course very<br>very right that china is extremely<br>important to australian economically and<br>that was also reflected in the other<br>panelist comments um<br>um but i i do think that it comes down<br>to<br>whether or not it's actually sustainable<br>for china to cut off<br>their one of their best sources of<br>natural resources if they in fact decide<br>as the party okay we want to build more<br>here or build more there right i mean<br>iron is required for steel which is<br>required for construction right that's<br>that's sort of how it goes and same<br>thing for other kinds of natural<br>resources so first of all you wonder<br>about what's the level of production<br>going to be of those uh downstream<br>products around the world but<br>particularly in china which will then<br>require us to you know require natural<br>resources from some place australia will<br>continue to have a comparative advantage<br>in supplying this now there is uh some<br>activity in africa now that may compete<br>with some of our uh natural resources<br>and that's the sort of thing that you<br>know we should worry about but then<br>there's other exploration here you know<br>rare earth metals and whatnot so<br>um you know i think it was what tim was<br>saying about the powerful economic<br>forces right there are just very<br>powerful forces in play which come down<br>to the distribution of resources across<br>countries and the actual economic<br>self-interest of those countries um and<br>you know i am i am<br>more more of the mind that you know<br>australia will continue to have those<br>natural resources and we'll need to find<br>other ways to trade with other countries<br>including there but also in services if<br>we don't have chinese students we'll<br>have indian students if we don't sell<br>our iron to china we'll try to sell it<br>someplace else and<br>or we'll you know build something here<br>so economics has a way of working out<br>the opportunities and exploiting the<br>opportunities when you allow people to<br>make decisions freely<br>and go where they want to go and<br>and trade where they want to trade so um<br>again that that restriction<br>of of covet and the restrictions that<br>are put in place by any centralized<br>regime really what the government is<br>saying here's what you should do here's<br>what you shouldn't do including in china<br>um that is a huge drag on uh on<br>discovery of new opportunities that<br>could replace some of the ones that have<br>been damaged during this time or where<br>we feel there's less less certainty<br>about the uh the demand going forward<br>for our products and our services so um<br>i am<br>cautiously optimistic but uh i agree<br>very much that there's going to be less<br>um less of a rosy future in terms of<br>growth and we've known that since you<br>know the start of our coveted response<br>we have uh significantly damaged the<br>trajectory that we otherwise would have<br>been on in terms of gdp per capita and<br>that of course rests very much on our<br>trade uh overseas so we you know we've<br>sort of already damaged ourselves now<br>and now we're trying to recuperate and<br>uh and looking at a much less uh rosy<br>future that's for sure but there's<br>definitely things australia you can do<br>and should do and the same with new<br>zealand right now that would be in the<br>interest of the countries without doubt<br>and so politically i think it's quite<br>easy to put together a package and and<br>sell it and<br>uh you know just avoid the more damaging<br>directions that some other countries<br>have going are going because because the<br>world has<br>i suppose subsumed economics and a whole<br>range of other things for good or for<br>bad over the last 20 years so<br>we are sorry for the last 20 30 years<br>the world has been all about trying to<br>make uh their people more prosperous to<br>do things collectively as a group to try<br>and boost trade and increase prosperity<br>and and then in the last two years or<br>three years probably uh you know you<br>hitting pretty hard and some of its<br>sectors sort of irrespective of the<br>economic impact you've had the covert uh<br>which we've talked about and and and<br>that's putting you know for lots of<br>people can can say it's the right thing<br>to do to put the health response ahead<br>of the economic response but<br>nevertheless it's been done<br>and now you have a situation in<br>in russia where uh there's no doubt that<br>the economic price that eastern europe<br>and russia in particular is going to pay<br>for that for this you know<br>incursion into ukraine is going to be<br>pretty high you sort of wonder at what<br>point does the world wake up and say<br>well actually we've we've got to<br>actually make our people more prosperous<br>uh and that has to become front and<br>center again tim do you think that's the<br>sort of<br>calculus that we've got to start<br>i don't think i can give you a snappy<br>one-line answer to that um<br>one of the things that's going through<br>my mind is what impact<br>the<br>the russian breaking of all the most<br>fundamental rules of stability in europe<br>will have on american politicians and<br>their thinking<br>and it's just possible that this could<br>be a giant wake-up call into washington<br>and that in itself could become a<br>positive matter i just don't know it's<br>just<br>there are too many uncertainties around<br>this uh new game uh uncertainties around<br>how far is president xi um going to take<br>china in this direction i<br>listening to rodney i just keep on<br>coming back to that wonderful analysis<br>of professor nicholas lardy the<br>i think one of the great analysts of the<br>chinese economy peterson institute who<br>points out that<br>the state-owned sector of china<br>is the greatest drag on the chinese<br>economy the total factor productivity of<br>the soes is appalling compared with the<br>chinese private sector so if he<br>continues to move in this direction<br>taking<br>nicholas's title of his book the state<br>strikes back in this direction it's<br>going to<br>increase his problems and china's<br>problems and in the long run the biggest<br>issue china faces is the demographic<br>change in chinese<br>data<br>the chinese population is likely to<br>shrink<br>massively over the next 30 or 40 years<br>and i always remember a professor of<br>demographics pointing out to an audience<br>that i was a participant in the<br>demographic projections tend to be the<br>most reliable of all long-term<br>projections<br>so we'll wait and see how that plays out<br>in the meantime i do think there's a<br>very intriguing political problem facing<br>australia new zealand and um<br>other partners in the tpp or cp tpp<br>exercise and that's the chinese<br>application<br>all of these trade agreements are not<br>just agreements about international<br>commerce they're also statements of<br>geopolitical alignment<br>and i find it really intriguing to think<br>how on earth are australian new zealand<br>going to react to this<br>you see in the early discussions i had<br>with a man that i know uh you rodney<br>will if you don't know and personally<br>know of him won't you win<br>who is um excuse my appalling anglo<br>version of chinese pronunciation but<br>he's an old friend of mine<br>and i've known and worked with him for<br>about 15 years<br>and<br>he even consulted me along with this<br>team<br>in washington on what on earth they<br>should do<br>in response to trump's ludicrous trade<br>war on them so during the earlier<br>discussions when i was the administrator<br>of the tpp negotiations because new<br>zealanders new zealand's the country<br>that established the tpp exercise<br>the discussion with<br>um once you win and the senior chinese<br>economic officials was<br>they didn't have a political clearance<br>to join but it's quite clear to me that<br>ministry of commerce wanted to join and<br>the really intriguing reason they wanted<br>to join was because they wanted the<br>disciplines on soes<br>they were well aware as nicholas<br>that the soes are the weakest part of<br>the chinese economy<br>and they wanted those disciplines to<br>reform the weakest part of their economy<br>because as they used to say to me the<br>impetus from wto reform has now run out<br>we need further external influence now<br>these people are still there i don't<br>know how that's going to play out<br>but politically for the united states of<br>war australia and new zealand and our<br>other partners<br>an interest by china in joining<br>cptpp is fundamentally a different<br>political challenge to when the united<br>states was involved in it<br>and i think this is going to be a real<br>political<br>problem<br>okay<br>look we're running out of time as always<br>and we've always got so much more to<br>talk about<br>i do want to come back if we can to the<br>events the last 24 hours and<br>and the impact of those and how they<br>might play out in the southern<br>hemisphere i mean we know that uh it's<br>not as immediate and large as it is for<br>uh yeah our relationship with china when<br>things happen there but nevertheless<br>we're seeing a pretty big tearing of the<br>fabric<br>of of geopolitics and and globalization<br>at the moment with russia's invasion of<br>ukraine an earlier panel talked about<br>increases in commodity prices and<br>protect potentially increases in<br>inflation as a result particularly oil<br>and gas obviously<br>what do you think<br>are the sort of short and are there any<br>longer term impacts of what's happening<br>now with russia and<br>and ukraine perhaps rodney if i come to<br>you first<br>and um and then just go quickly around<br>the panel to finish<br>yeah it adds a layer of disruption on<br>our already disrupted world as we see<br>with supply chains movement of goods the<br>frozen movement of services so it is a<br>real shock and it will add to inflation<br>um and particularly for europe<br>it's a classic supply shock board that<br>will diminish growth so we're going to<br>take time to work<br>through this what it means if there's<br>one glimmer of optimism<br>from this discussion today is that maybe<br>putin has sped up the protest process<br>maybe the invasion doesn't go as well as<br>maybe<br>in the end there's a backlash within<br>russia and even within china that this<br>is the wrong track to go down and so<br>you know maybe we're in a things can<br>happen faster and in five years we find<br>ourselves in a better position than we<br>uh so i think basically i agree with uh<br>the analysis that you know there's going<br>to be probably a an impact on<br>prices overseas and of course if<br>commodity prices go up that's uh good<br>for australia potentially um it depends<br>on what commodities we're speaking of<br>but you know we've been worried about<br>inflation anyway for a while now because<br>of the signals in the us and elsewhere<br>and so it's really just a question of<br>how long it takes to propagate through<br>the supply chains and come here<br>and we have had a lot of fiscal stimulus<br>um and i think new zealanders also have<br>that because of it and so that gives<br>sort of the capacity of prices to<br>actually rise um because people have the<br>spending capacity so i am a bit worried<br>about inflation going forward which<br>would have uh other effects on the<br>housing market but<br>just to see things in perspective um you<br>know the kinds of effects on uh<br>dampening effects on global trade that<br>we are seeing or may see because of this<br>incipient and now happening war um are<br>really small in comparison to what we've<br>done to ourselves over the last two<br>years again just to keep it in<br>perspective um we have we have kicked a<br>massive own goal not just here in the<br>antiquities but overseas as well many<br>places and so to focus now on one<br>particular event um it's sort of like<br>saying gee the canadian truckers you<br>know stopped trade over the ambassador<br>bridge and isn't that horrible because<br>it's disrupting supply chains and<br>everything well that's exactly what we<br>did<br>that what the the politicians the<br>leaders of countries all around the<br>world did for<br>many months if not years during the<br>covert period so keep perspective on<br>what's happening and also remember all<br>politics is local<br>you know australia and new zealand care<br>about what's going on in their backyard<br>and our political choices are going to<br>be<br>reflective of what's important to<br>australia and new zealand and you know<br>as much as it's sad and dismaying to see<br>this sort of tearing of the geopolitical<br>fabric as rodney said um in russia and<br>ukraine<br>it's it's just not that relevant to the<br>guy on the street in australia and so<br>what's relevant to him is<br>can he keep his job can he feed his<br>family can he see his children thrive<br>can you take a vacation in bali et<br>cetera and so the the best move for the<br>politicians again is while things play<br>out overseas as they will uh and there<br>may be some ups and downs and commodity<br>prices and and general uh willingness to<br>to<br>trade with other countries um you know<br>try to do the best that he or she can in<br>his own patch and that means again<br>lifting restrictions getting back to<br>normal as quickly as possible oh by the<br>way if people want some information<br>about that this is my new book a<br>reasonably new book about the coveted<br>period<br>um just have to give a plug it's<br>available on amazon and it does talk<br>about how there isn't a health economics<br>trade-off economics is about health<br>economics is about providing an<br>opportunity a platform for the creation<br>of human longevity and well-being and uh<br>and the policy response we've seen<br>during covert has not been good for<br>health<br>congratulations on being the uh panelist<br>across the two days who's been able to<br>get through the most naked plug of their<br>book well done indeed um and uh finally<br>tim last word for you just very briefly<br>uh<br>in terms of the impact on new zealand of<br>what's playing out at the other end of<br>the world<br>well the first question would be what<br>will be the direct trade impact um<br>sanctions will be imposed but it's<br>important to remember that our total<br>exports to russia are a tiny 200 million<br>dollars that's about one percent of new<br>zealand total global<br>goods exports and in any event it is<br>highly unlikely in the past when<br>sanctions have been implemented for<br>political reasons almost always food has<br>been exempted so i think one kind of<br>move immediately to say that the front<br>of mind thing of the media will be you<br>know what will this cost if new zealand<br>joins in sanctions says we will join in<br>sanctions i have no doubt about that<br>will be absolutely minimal you wouldn't<br>even notice it<br>the bigger impacts economically will be<br>through the subtle impacts on<br>the price of oils now i think this<br>morning reached 110 in the futures<br>markets<br>this will add further to u.s inflation<br>this will influence decisions by the fed<br>as to how quickly they want to move on<br>the federal funds rate and therefore<br>what the outlook for global inflation<br>will be so i think this sort of the<br>indirect economic impacts are going to<br>be vastly more important than any<br>immediate trading banks<br>but you know you need to have a separate<br>discussion try and put numbers around<br>that<br>but certainly far more important<br>the bigger issues for new zealand really<br>will be political and i think we've<br>covered those issues<br>great thank you very much to the three<br>of you tim grosser former trade minister<br>rodney jones uh principal economist at<br>wigram capital advisors and uh gigi<br>foster professor of economics the<br>university of new south wales in sydney<br>thank you all three for joining us today<br>and wrapping up our<br>our conference program<br>well matt<br>it's been a busy day or two and of<br>course playing out<br>in a geopolitical environment which is<br>very dramatically changing yeah it's<br>happening live i think you and i have<br>discussed in the past i'm<br>reminded i was in here in 2004 uh late<br>in that year when of course there was<br>you know this is not a new conflict and<br>it's going the relationship between<br>russia and ukraine of course is<br>spanning centuries uh but i remember<br>walking waking early walking through the<br>empty streets of kiev which we've seen<br>on the media today that was just at the<br>time of the contested election between<br>uh yushenko and yanukovych<br>which was again a part of this tension<br>between ukraine as a western nation or<br>ukraine as part of the wider russian<br>sphere<br>i know you have been up to yourself it's<br>it's quite amazing very sad obviously to<br>watch all of this<br>play out and see the scenes there so<br>i guess it adds a note of realism to all<br>of the other discussions we've had look<br>i'm uh<br>i've been amazed at the the panelists<br>we've had on over the last couple of<br>days covering so many topics we said at<br>the start any one of them could have<br>been exploded out into a couple of days<br>worth of discussion where obviously<br>we're skimming stone we're only able to<br>touch onto them<br>lightly i've got some views but what<br>have been<br>some of your biggest themes over the<br>last two days<br>i think just the in some ways actually<br>in the last 24 hours particularly since<br>since the invasion in<br>uh uh the ukraine just how<br>challenging it is uh for policy makers<br>to make sense of everything that's<br>happening at the moment<br>and you've had covert you've got<br>suddenly inflation which as somebody<br>pointed out to me today you know half of<br>the workforce has no probably more has<br>no personal experience of<br>uh<br>another person said to me that you know<br>graduates from the school and other<br>schools that will be going to work and<br>treasury will have had absolutely no<br>personal knowledge of of inflation<br>and and the detrimental impacts have on<br>everybody and and in particular lower<br>income people<br>and so you've got sort of history<br>cascading and on top of<br>of a range of events and so so to me<br>that's it so it's going to require cool<br>heads<br>i think it is also going to require a<br>focus on<br>on economic activity again um you know<br>there are entirely reasonable reasons<br>why all these things have<br>subsumed the importance of economic<br>activity in in recent years but<br>uh<br>you know if we don't get back to<br>helping people<br>grow their incomes<br>improve a lot of their families<br>and and succeed in their own lives then<br>actually we'll see<br>more<br>geopolitical unrest around the world<br>because there's a whole lot of people<br>that are getting pretty impatient um<br>with with with the way things are so<br>i think for policy makers uh here and<br>and elsewhere we've we've really got to<br>get back<br>focused on on you know what makes people<br>more prosperous what helps them get<br>ahead uh and i think there's a bit of<br>that that's been missing and in some<br>ways the debate has evolved in the last<br>48 hours i think you said it that uh<br>our um you know that what's happened in<br>russia and ukraine has suddenly put you<br>know some some pretty cold hard realism<br>over some of the policy discussions that<br>have occurred in the last few years that<br>don't seem to have you know gone<br>particularly far<br>yeah it's uh it's a<br>striking and<br>difficult event to grapple with but<br>so there were two or three things that<br>you mentioned there that have been on my<br>mind too listening and observing uh so<br>many of the panelists we've had um<br>the first<br>i had was actually the shared aspiration<br>people are looking for the same things<br>it is<br>thriving businesses thriving society<br>thriving natural world that's what<br>that's what mike do management school is<br>all about<br>and the disagreements come of course and<br>how you get there so okay that's that's<br>easy to say um<br>i really took from helen clark's talk<br>yesterday this notion of preparedness<br>this is a complex interconnected world<br>every session we've had<br>has interwoven into every other session<br>you know housing is connected to<br>monetary policy globalization is<br>connected into everything else it's all<br>of those are connected it's a lot going<br>on<br>so when i look at that the the quality<br>of anal analysis the rigor that's being<br>applied we heard jim bulger yesterday<br>challenging people to think more boldly<br>and yet do the hard work do the homework<br>to see how are these policies going to<br>work together that's come through as a<br>is a huge thing for me we need the bold<br>thinking but we need to be very careful<br>because there have been a few punts into<br>the darker area<br>and we heard about this we've been<br>hearing about that uh some of the<br>uh policy analysis<br>and then and then execution risk is<br>pretty high and there were some points<br>in the last two days where you didn't<br>get a massive amount of confidence um<br>that the work had been done<br>and and we talked about the kiwi number<br>eight wire mentality as it applies to<br>policy making and it's not tidy um so we<br>do need to<br>improve the the rigor of some of these<br>decisions i completely agree i also<br>wonder whether we're seeing some of the<br>debates um<br>uh overtaken a little bit<br>so for example the debate around housing<br>which i<br>know is a particularly big issue<br>but i get a little bit of the sense that<br>we're still rehearsing the arguments the<br>pre-inflationary arguments<br>and now we're moving into a period of<br>quite high and growing interest rates<br>potentially relative to where we've been<br>yeah and that might change the whole<br>discussion around housing i suspect so<br>it's a very fluid time it's a it's a<br>time of some pretty quick changes<br>and<br>and yeah i think the great thing about<br>this is we're having a discussion and<br>people are actually being encouraged to<br>come up with different views and that<br>was really the the real positive of jim<br>bulger's<br>i think contribution yesterday which was<br>you know let's just think up some new<br>ideas um and let's let's have a crack at<br>them uh and and and think them through<br>uh and i think that's hopefully we've<br>started that process over the last two<br>days i agree thanks i i<br>i'll wrap us up but i think it's a good<br>place and it's where we began uh<br>actually when we started the new zealand<br>economics forum last year<br>our intention was to bring together<br>people from lots of different<br>backgrounds to debate you know we're not<br>seeking consensus here we're seeking<br>informed disagreement you know rigorous<br>analysis vigorous debate was the motto<br>we need it more than ever and so that's<br>absolutely critical we wanted to provide<br>a forum for that i think my last<br>observation is and particularly from the<br>the panel that we've just heard<br>the overlay from the the sort of<br>clinical economic arguments and the<br>overplay of politics and all of this you<br>know what are the what are the national<br>stories and you certainly see that in<br>russia and the ukraine but that<br>political overlay on all of the topics<br>and i think you know there will be<br>plenty of opportunity to weave that in<br>for next year and speaking of next year<br>yes so<br>we will wrap up the conference here it's<br>been a great two days again a huge thank<br>you to all of our presenters who have<br>joined us<br>over over zoom next year we hope of<br>course to welcome you here on campus uh<br>thanks to all of our moderators who've<br>joined and
