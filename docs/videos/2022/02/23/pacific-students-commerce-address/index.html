relatives<br>witnessing this pacific welcome<br>celebration online<br>fat i love talk to all of our targo<br>pacific new and returning students<br>greetings to you all<br>in the name of our lord jesus christ<br>our scripture reading this morning is<br>taken from psalm 71<br>20<br>and<br>philippians chapter 4<br>verse 13.<br>it reads<br>though you have made me see troubles<br>many and bitter<br>you will restore my life again<br>from the depth of the earth you will<br>again bring me up<br>i can do all things through him<br>who gives me strength<br>the theme of<br>our message this morning is<br>look up to jesus<br>david was the greatest king of israel<br>he never knew that a shepherd boy<br>could be one day become king over the<br>whole nation of israel<br>being a shepherd means<br>he needed to deal with his enemies<br>of vicious wolves and wild animals<br>trying to devour<br>his flock<br>but even when he became king he never<br>runs short of peter enemies<br>who wanted to destroy him<br>that is why i believe he uttered these<br>words<br>in his psalm 71 verse 20<br>though you have made me see troubles<br>many and peter<br>david had his share<br>of<br>so many problems<br>so many hurdles so many difficulties and<br>troubles in his time<br>both from his enemies<br>and also from his own<br>now for you new students<br>your academic journey in otago starts<br>today remember<br>you will become<br>on your graduation day<br>but until then<br>you must have your shares of trials<br>shares of problems shares of<br>difficulties<br>shares of challenge during your studies<br>that you need to go through<br>in your life in otago campus<br>sometimes you will wish that you have<br>your parents<br>alongside you sometimes you miss your<br>families you miss your friends<br>you miss the ordinary way of life that<br>you used to have<br>but these are all part and parcels<br>of<br>your journey<br>you need to look up to jesus<br>and you will always find help<br>now to the returning students<br>some of you are finishing this year<br>congratulations<br>some of you are struggling to cope with<br>covert crisis<br>even some of our international students<br>were isolated even<br>during the time of<br>the pandemic<br>and unable to go home to their families<br>during holiday<br>yes we know<br>we have shared<br>your pain and suffering<br>but we all need to look up to jesus<br>and we can find help<br>we are all trying our best to deal with<br>the reality of covet and its impact upon<br>our lives<br>but everything is not about covert<br>but it's how<br>we can resolve<br>and this is how<br>by looking up to jesus<br>and have faith<br>that we can find help in him<br>but listen to david's words in his<br>prayer to god he said you will restore<br>my life again from the death of<br>the earth you will again bring me up<br>who is this person that they will pray<br>to you<br>god<br>his father<br>and i believe this is the same<br>a god that paul wrote<br>in his letter to the philippians 4<br>chapter 4 verse 13 and he said i can do<br>strength you have that inner strength in<br>you<br>and that power in you<br>that will enable us and strengthen us<br>during this time of trial<br>and during<br>your time of studies<br>so it is our prayer<br>that our heavenly father will continue<br>to bless you not only the students<br>but also for vice chancellor<br>and the staff<br>and also the manager of bic center<br>and all of these supporting staff<br>providing that support for our new and<br>our returning students<br>otago can be a place of new beginnings<br>it is a place<br>of hope and a place that will give<br>abundance<br>to our students<br>as we come to<br>engage<br>with these<br>difficulties<br>when jesus said all power<br>on earth<br>and heaven is given to me<br>go therefore baptize everyone in the<br>name of the father the son of the holy<br>spirit<br>look up to jesus<br>and find help<br>amen<br>let us pray<br>our precious heavenly father king
