I'm a marine ecologist and I'm the director of the <br>Master of Marine Conservation programme and all of  <br>the Marine Biology programmes at Victoria University <br>of Wellington.<br>I'm Nicky Nelson. I'm a Professor of Conservation Biology in the School of Biological Sciences at Victoria University of Wellington.  <br>Both the Master of Marine Conservation programme <br>and the Master of Conservation Biology  <br>programme are 180 point programmes and both can <br>typically be completed within a one-year period.  <br>So the Master of Marine Conservation programme is <br>a programme that is primarily focused on marine  <br>environments and a very strong focus on marine <br>biology. If you join the programme you'll conduct  <br>a number of courses that are field course-based <br>and these include visiting locations throughout  <br>New Zealand and also the opportunity to join our <br>tropical marine biology field course which runs in  <br>alternate years between Indonesia and Australia. <br>There are still the opportunities for you to  <br>take courses while you're here in terrestrial <br>ecology and fresh water ecology but the primary  <br>focus of that programme is on marine environments.<br>The Master of Conservation Biology programme is a 180  <br>point taught masters programme that is predominantly <br>focused on more terrestrial environments  <br>so there is the opportunity to learn from all of <br>the experience that we have in New Zealand about  <br>how to manage terrestrial environments from <br>a whole range of human impacts. There are the  <br>opportunity to take some marine courses but the <br>core courses to this programme are focused around  <br>terrestrial conservation biology and terrestrial <br>management. You'll cover courses like invasive  <br>species management, pest management and also <br>can include things around law and policy too.<br>Students in our Conservation Biology programmes <br>will gain confidence in themselves. They'll gain  <br>the capacity to question, to do critical <br>thinking, to apply the science that they  <br>learn about in different areas. They'll go <br>out able to access a whole lot of experts  <br>information and apply that to a new situation <br>that they are tasked with managing.  <br>We're really looking for students who have a <br>strong desire for a career in conservation.<br>We are generally looking for students <br>who have got a background in ecology  <br>or marine biology and a strong desire to <br>make a difference in the in the future.<br>Our students go out into the world after <br>their Master's programme and they might make a  <br>difference in setting the rules under which <br>we do our environmental management through  <br>policy. They might go out and become conservation <br>educators understanding the science that underpins  <br>conservation and helping other people <br>to understand that and make a difference  <br>themselves. Or they may be those people on the <br>ground hands dirty saving a threatened species.<br>The single biggest lesson i think <br>conservation biology has taught us  <br>particularly a New Zealand example here is don't <br>give up. We have had actions for conservation that  <br>have brought species back from one single female. Don't give up. Don't give up. Try something new.<br>The clear advantage that Victoria University <br>of Wellington has over other universities  <br>particularly in New Zealand is our capital city <br>location. The fact that we are located so close  <br>to central and local government means that we can <br>draw on a huge range of people to contribute to  <br>our programmes. And that's what we do. So we have <br>people come from the Department of Conservation,<br>from the Ministry of Primary Industries, from local <br>non-government organisations, who contribute to  <br>our programmes in a variety of different ways. It <br>also gives you the opportunity when joining this  <br>course to interact with people working in real <br>situations and real life conservation scientists.<br>The world needs more people studying conservation <br>because there are so many ways you can contribute  <br>and let's be honest we're not necessarily <br>winning the war right now. Conservation is the key  <br>to us having a very balanced lifestyle. It's <br>connecting us with nature for our well-being.<br>We need more conservation biologists because we <br>need more people who can apply themselves to this  <br>very vital area of study.<br>If you have really strong conservation values and a real desire to make a big difference in the future to the way that we look after   <br>and manage our marine and terrestrial and freshwater environments then this is the kind of program that that would suit you.<br>Write us an email. We're really well practiced at chatting to <br>students to help them figure out how to make these  <br>programmes work for them or in fact discuss them in <br>comparison with other things that they're wanting  <br>to investigate.<br>So if we've told you about our Master of Marine Conservation programme or our Master of Conservation Biology programme interests you<br>then please don't hesitate to get in contact with us.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
