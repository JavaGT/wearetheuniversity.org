Master of Environmental Science, or the Master of Climate Change Science and Policy.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may

need<br>students who are creative and critical<br>enough to be able to engage with these<br>environmental issues and then to find<br>those solutions for us<br>there's quite a bit of overlap<br>in the masters of climate change science<br>and policy the masters of environmental<br>science and the masters of environmental<br>studies the key element that you'll<br>develop more so in the masters of<br>environmental studies is an<br>understanding of the social elements of<br>the environmental issues that we're<br>facing around the world<br>climate change is one of the most<br>pressing issues in our world we don't<br>have much time to wait<br>and we need<br>to understand the issues we need better<br>skills and we also need more people to<br>study and promote climate change<br>solutions i guess broadly with a<br>definition of environmental science<br>what is an environmental scientist i<br>look into them as someone who<br>is interested in earth systems generally<br>so the atmosphere the hydrosphere the<br>biosphere and the lithosphere so someone<br>who's interested in environmental<br>science very much has a grounding has a<br>love of nature and the environment<br>they notice that things are kind of<br>they're kind of going astray a bit and<br>they're using the toolkit of the<br>scientist data collection and analysis<br>in order to remedy those issues<br>kia ora my name is andrew reese and i'm<br>a senior lecturer in environmental<br>science at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>my name is alex lowe i am senior<br>lecturer in climate change i am also the<br>program coordinator for the master of<br>venue<br>so the introduction i just gave is a<br>pepeha<br>and that identifies for maori our<br>genealogical connections both to the<br>landscape and to the people of the<br>landscape<br>so the masters of environmental studies<br>program is very much about the social<br>aspects of environmental issues the<br>focus is the development of this really<br>important social sciences skill to<br>actually engage with these environmental<br>issues define them well or define the<br>human element or the societal element of<br>them and then solutions that really<br>focus on change in society but we have a<br>focus on how indigenous voices being<br>negotiated in contemporary environmental<br>research policy and governance we have<br>environmental psychology<br>which allows you to reflect on your own<br>place in the environmental issues that<br>we're talking about and we have<br>environmental activism which is appeals<br>to lots of people and then we have a<br>focus on environmental policy as well so<br>lots of different avenues for people to<br>pursue<br>our muscle climate change science and<br>policy has both science and policy<br>components here and the other programs<br>such as martial environmental science<br>focuses on designs whereas the<br>environmental studies master has a<br>stronger focus on the human dimensions<br>we are<br>standing in between the two programs<br>addressing both dimensions the science<br>and policy at the same time we also<br>allow and encourage our students to<br>select<br>elective courses from other programs<br>which means that<br>even if you join the master of climate<br>change science and policy you will be<br>able<br>to take some courses from the other two<br>programs in fact many of our students<br>are also interested in environmental<br>studies generally and also environmental<br>science<br>so you'll want to have a background in<br>science and the joy of environmental<br>science is that it's so broad<br>any discipline will do so you could be a<br>biologist a physicist a chemist a data<br>scientist you want to have some sort of<br>backing or background in scientific<br>methods but the way that we've<br>structured the master of environmental<br>science at victoria university of<br>wellington is perhaps you've been in<br>industry or you've been working for a<br>few years and you want to upskill or<br>perhaps you've got a background more in<br>policy and management<br>we've designed the masters of<br>environmental science to be pretty<br>generalist depending on on your specific<br>situation we're happy to take you in and<br>teach you the skills that you need to<br>address these environmental issues<br>so wellington is a great place to study<br>in a masters of environmental studies<br>because of its explicit connections<br>to government agencies here in<br>wellington being in the capital i think<br>that gives our students a really good<br>sense of being able to influence<br>not only policy but culture of alterator<br>or new zealand in terms of our<br>environmental ethic new zealand's an<br>excellent place for<br>a host of reasons one it's essentially a<br>real-time sandbox the environment is<br>changing so drastically in so many ways<br>so it's got the southern alps which are<br>some of the fastest created mountains<br>but also the fastest eroding mountains<br>in the world because we're on plate<br>tectonic boundaries we're in the zonal<br>westerlies so lots of precipitation hits<br>new zealand year round so in terms of<br>atmospheric interplay lithospheric<br>interplay it's really really interesting<br>our university is the only<br>university in new zealand offering a<br>specialized<br>master program in climate change so we<br>are in a much better position in<br>offering you the right skill sets we<br>will likely in climate change<br>specifically if you're interested in<br>getting to know more about the masters<br>of environmental studies if you would<br>like to learn more about the master of<br>climate science and policy program if<br>you're interested in learning more about<br>the environment please get in touch with<br>us and we welcome you in the victoria<br>university of wellington<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
