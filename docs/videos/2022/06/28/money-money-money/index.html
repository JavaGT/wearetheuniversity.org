about all<br>things to do with an important topic<br>money<br>today we're going to be talking with a<br>group of learned experts a group of<br>great people<br>about starting businesses about<br>investments about<br>planning for our future whether that be<br>in a career sense or in a retirement<br>sense and about growing wealth and<br>security<br>for our whanau for our<br>our lives and for the things that we<br>love<br>so the first thing i need to note in a<br>discussion about money is that none of<br>what we talk about here is<br>investment advice or financial advice um<br>talk to an expert<br>in<br>in real time if you want that kind of<br>advice and and this isn't constituting<br>that<br>uh second i just want to introduce the<br>members of our panel so we're joined<br>here by jen baird<br>ceo of the real estate real estate<br>institute of new zealand uh by liz coe a<br>financial expert with particular<br>expertise around planning for a<br>fantastic retirement by billy joe hopper<br>a business owner and entrepreneur also<br>an investor in her own right<br>and by stuart anderson an investment<br>advisor with craigs so kyora tatou<br>welcome to the wonderful panelists and<br>thank you for joining us we're going to<br>start with a rapid fire round table<br>digital roundtable questions so that<br>people can understand a little bit about<br>you and your your mindset on money so<br>the first question and i'll go around<br>the group in the order we just did there<br>is<br>if you were<br>gifted a hundred thousand dollars<br>tomorrow<br>to invest as you chose what would you do<br>with that money and i'm going to start<br>with you jen<br>i love this question thank you for<br>giving it to me i feel like i've spent<br>ages dreaming about this<br>um so after many many hours of careful<br>thought<br>i think probably what i would do is put<br>half of it on my mortgage so 50 grand on<br>a mortgage and then i think i would like<br>back myself to buy a nice car or some<br>really nice art because life's short<br>right you've got to have a bit of a<br>balance and enjoy yourself um<br>but probably what would happen is that<br>over the following 12 months<br>all of the other 50 000 would end up on<br>great answer honest<br>tying strongly into the real estate uh<br>platform there<br>and liz what about you 100 dollars<br>tomorrow what would you do<br>it sounds like a lot of money but<br>actually it's not uh for me personally<br>i'm in a stage of life where i'm<br>de-accumulating wealth uh and so what i<br>would do for me personally is set up<br>probably um an endowment fund with my<br>local community foundation for<br>charitable purposes but for anybody else<br>who's not in that state for someone<br>younger i would say the first thing to<br>do is to pay off debt<br>uh and then set yourself up a decent<br>emergency fund and then either pay off<br>your mortgage if you have a home or if<br>you don't have a home saver you know use<br>that money to<br>as a deposit for your first time so that<br>would be my recommendation<br>excellent good your own situation and<br>and others and billy joe<br>yeah i i think my husband would love a<br>dodge charger but the price of petrol<br>right i would say absolutely no<br>because i'm in a business and i'm<br>getting return on ad spend at around<br>three to four times<br>i'm sorry to say i'd have to spend it on<br>my business and<br>um mr facebook would get all that money<br>but um yeah i would put it back into my<br>business<br>excellent that's a very<br>immediate investment and<br>uh stuart<br>yeah thank you<br>it is a great question um<br>and it's easy to put your your<br>business head on or your academic hat<br>and say for example in my line of work<br>i'd invest a lot and um and look i would<br>be investing a decent amount of it<br>obviously with markets pulling back in<br>my world it's a great time to be having<br>spare cash flow to invest but as jen<br>said life's about balance you know i'd<br>obviously want to do something uh nice<br>with the family um but i also<br>am involved with a number of<br>philanthropic<br>organizations and my family have a<br>little giving program that we do every<br>year as well so we'd allocate some to<br>that some had a bit of fun with um but i<br>would like to get my hands on a decent<br>chunk of it and invested into the market<br>over the next couple of months<br>yeah brilliant interesting everybody's<br>uh<br>everybody's got a<br>quite a wide range of um approaches<br>there which probably sets the scene for<br>the<br>rest of the discussion because of course<br>um people people watching this will be<br>in a range of different situations um<br>personally and professionally as well so<br>i am going to<br>dive into a series of questions here<br>some of them might apply generally some<br>of them will apply to you know just one<br>or two of you depending on your sector<br>as we go through over the next 50<br>minutes or so we'll wrap up within the<br>hour<br>can i start on a<br>perennial new zealand wealth creation or<br>investment<br>favorite which is the real estate<br>market and here jen i think you're the<br>right person to start with<br>for people looking to get into the real<br>estate market we've all been looking at<br>the news and watching house price of<br>portability stories um<br>their sort of mainstay of media in new<br>zealand what would you advise for<br>somebody to get onto that ladder<br>well i would say do your homework and<br>then if it's the right decision for you<br>to have property as part of your<br>portfolio or you want to own a home to<br>live in you just got to get in there is<br>a lot of media around and regardless of<br>which way the market is going it is like<br>you say one of those conversations that<br>new zealanders love we love reading<br>about it we love talking about it and of<br>course everybody's an expert but there<br>is no crystal ball and so we never know<br>where the top or the bottom of that<br>market is until afterwards but really<br>it's about your own personal<br>circumstances and what's right for you<br>and what's right for you when um you<br>know so really it's kind of getting<br>getting a lot of information really<br>knowing what you're getting into i think<br>that actually is the same as any other<br>investment it's about having your<br>information lined up talking to the<br>right people at the moment there's so<br>much data out there there's numbers<br>coming at you from everybody every<br>second day in the media you know i think<br>about the data that the real estate<br>institute puts out our data is<br>last month's unconditional sales so a<br>few weeks old potentially for some of<br>them everybody else's data has settled<br>sales so a month or so older than that<br>the people that really know what's going<br>on on the market people that know what<br>happened at open homes on the weekend<br>and what sold in your area last week are<br>real estate agents talk to them they<br>know what's happening right now<br>fantastic interesting liz did you have<br>any views on that one as well<br>look i think it's really important if<br>you're aiming to buy a home for yourself<br>or rental property to be in a really<br>solid financial position because the key<br>thing at the moment is being able to<br>borrow money<br>and so any uh lender will look at your<br>track record they'll look at<br>your spending patterns whether you're<br>able to save so you really really need<br>to focus on spending less than you earn<br>you know demonstrate your ability to<br>save to be in a strong solid position<br>and like particularly if you're if you<br>think you're buying an investment<br>property we you know you might need to<br>prop that up a week but out of your<br>uh out of your um income so you need to<br>be able to withstand that you don't want<br>to be in a situation where you can't<br>make your payments and you're forced to<br>sell up<br>especially if it's in a declining market<br>so just be in a really strong financial<br>position have some emergency funds have<br>good savings good track record on your<br>spending habits that kind of thing<br>that will stand in good stead<br>thanks for that and i'm going to<br>stay on that one for a moment because<br>you just<br>raised the the concept of investment<br>properties and you know for some this<br>will be the challenge of getting onto<br>the property ladder as a first-time<br>buyer but how how do you think of<br>investment properties a second home<br>third home<br>what strategies might you consider if<br>you're looking at investment properties<br>as part of a portfolio for people who<br>are in that situation and then might<br>link back into youtube as well<br>well i think that um you know property<br>is is a great way to grow wealth because<br>it it uses leverage in other words it<br>uses other people's money the key thing<br>is to manage your cash flows because<br>that's where people get called out with<br>property so you know leverage works both<br>ways it can leverage you way up for us<br>or it can you know magnify your losses<br>so you absolutely have to focus on cash<br>flow and so most of the successful<br>property investors that's what they do<br>you don't want to get caught short<br>so um it's about you know i i'm a big<br>fan of probably i've been investing for<br>20 years in property and i know how well<br>it works<br>um but you've really got to do your<br>homework uh just to know the numbers um<br>to know<br>just how it ticks and um<br>and and have a a<br>a well thought out strategy you know<br>what type of property you want to invest<br>in what geographic area make sure you<br>get a really good team of experts around<br>your accountant's lawyers what have you<br>to advise you as you uh as you build<br>your portfolio<br>that's brilliant jen what are you seeing<br>in the investment property side it's<br>obviously been a tumultuous time<br>yeah i mean i would say everything that<br>um that liz has just said absolutely<br>support that but also i think you know<br>buying the property is the<br>straightforward part when you're a<br>landlord you know a lot has changed in<br>that space in the last few years there<br>is significantly more regulation um for<br>landlords than that than there has been<br>for well forever um you know all of the<br>healthy homes regulations and then<br>obviously tax changes that came out the<br>at the beginning of 2020 i think it was<br>gosh i was going to say last year<br>um<br>and you know and so and having a good<br>property manager those sorts of things<br>are really going to make that process a<br>lot<br>more straightforward for you because<br>it's you know when i think about housing<br>in new zealand it's a big challenge<br>right and actually more and more people<br>are going to be renting for a long time<br>and so private landlords have got a<br>really important part to play in solving<br>or helping to solve that<br>particular challenge for new zealanders<br>but it's important that you're not just<br>seeing it as an asset that you recognise<br>that there are people that are going to<br>live in that house and that you have<br>responsibilities to them as well<br>yeah yeah it's a really important point<br>and i might<br>bounce across to you now billy joe i<br>think<br>i think property investment played a<br>start in your your business investment<br>career so i want to move into business<br>investment but can you just give us a<br>little bit more of a background about<br>how you got going in your investment and<br>business career<br>yeah well i um so my husband and i we<br>ended up buying our first home and when<br>i say home it was a 1.5<br>um<br>bedroom townhouse in<br>wellington and that's what we could<br>afford right we couldn't afford a big<br>home um on its own um standalone<br>property you had to either buy units or<br>something small and that's what we did<br>but we wanted to get into the property<br>investment space and so we ended up<br>going to a um lecture on with lisa<br>dudson who's huge in property and we<br>ended up<br>um being there for two hours bought her<br>book read it in two days then six weeks<br>later bought our first<br>property and that was basically off the<br>equity on the home that we had<br>bought and it had<br>increased by um<br>fifty thousand dollars um in six months<br>and so it was quite a hot market but um<br>on on that point of property i was just<br>at a home<br>on the weekend and it's been wanting 250<br>000 with a 320<br>a week return on rental so i still love<br>property i think we you know as<br>landlords have a responsibility to<br>provide homes that people can't afford<br>there are bargains to be had and i think<br>there's a lot of investors that are<br>getting rid of um a lot of their homes<br>so it is a good time um you know<br>interest rates are still quite low i<br>remember we bought ours and it was up to<br>nine even 11<br>so you can still get in um maybe you<br>know get a three year<br>um uh mortgage but i think you know just<br>get on the ladder<br>anytime's a good time i say but you your<br>expectations have to be lowered and it<br>is a do up<br>you know and and that's part of that<br>only in a home journey<br>yeah yeah and it is you're right it is a<br>journey with a and with a lot of<br>different people involved whether<br>they're on<br>on your team or the people living in the<br>in the property so i think when you get<br>into property investment you should be<br>the manager like you should take care of<br>that's your investment so make sure you<br>know who your tenants are and they know<br>you and every three months you go and<br>check on your property because it is<br>your invest it's your baby right<br>and you make it known that that is they<br>they need to take care of it too we you<br>will take care of it as well that's<br>that's kind of your your responsibility<br>but<br>both of you have a responsibility<br>um to take care of that asset<br>and so how did<br>property uh<br>play into the launching of your business<br>and i guess put that in the context of<br>what<br>what risks did you have to take<br>financially in order to start in your<br>business career you as an entrepreneur<br>yeah i suppose well we were lucky enough<br>to get into property investing before we<br>got into business so this<br>i've been a journalist for 20 years so<br>um business wasn't re it was a dream<br>but it became a reality after i<br>put in the investment and doing the mba<br>so got the tools<br>and then wanted to use them but because<br>we had made that investment into<br>our first property we were able to sell<br>it and get a hundred thousand dollars<br>which became seed funding for our um our<br>first business uh which our second<br>business which is b day<br>um our company we have uh today so<br>hugely i mean i'm not a trust fund baby<br>wish we were um but we as a whanau had<br>to pull in our resources and you know a<br>lot of com you know a lot of people have<br>to that's the reality you<br>yeah and i can imagine that those are<br>you know it suddenly gets a little bit<br>more real when you're putting an asset<br>that you've worked hard for up um up as<br>collateral and getting things going<br>yeah yeah and in terms of the risk i<br>think we always like i've learned a<br>really good framework it's called the<br>swot analysis so you look at you know<br>what are the strengths of your business<br>what are the weaknesses the<br>opportunities and what are the threats<br>and if you really glean down on each of<br>those categories you kind of work out<br>hey i think i've got something really<br>good here<br>it's not it's going to be tough because<br>people don't know about our product and<br>what it does<br>it's going to be a journey but i think<br>if you back yourself and a lot of it is<br>purely belief you cut it's not there's a<br>whole lot of theory but there's a whole<br>lot of just belief behind what you're<br>doing and what you get into in business<br>but it's not a quick win that's it<br>she's not going to las vegas<br>no<br>well i was um going to go to you<br>liz actually on that and then i'll pop<br>over to you stuart on a different asset<br>class but different investment approach<br>but<br>liz when you think about<br>business we hear billy joe talk about<br>risk and you know this is a it can be a<br>it's not a guaranteed win and risks<br>risks can sound great when they come off<br>and they all work out fine that's what<br>movies are made of um but the other side<br>of risk is of course it doesn't always<br>come off when you talk to business<br>owners and you consider your career how<br>do you think about failure<br>and<br>absorbing failure dealing with failure<br>courting failure how do you think about<br>the role of failure<br>in a wealth creation over the span of a<br>career<br>well i think um this is where a lot of<br>entrepreneurial people can come and<br>start you have to plan ahead for failure<br>and like we don't want to necessarily<br>focus on failure you obviously want to<br>focus on success but i always encourage<br>people to have what i call a safe<br>deposit box<br>and i mean i don't mean that literally i<br>mean figuratively so you don't go all in<br>you know like when you're playing poker<br>you know you don't put all your chips in<br>you you<br>leave some reserved so if things do fall<br>over<br>you've got something to build from again<br>and you know you you don't look very far<br>to see you know like people who are<br>truly entrepreneurial they're they you<br>they're often you know boom or bust you<br>know donald trump's an example i guess<br>doesn't mean you know<br>but<br>those sort of people take a lot of risk<br>and so there is always that possibility<br>that things won't work out so you've<br>just got to have that in the back of<br>your mind<br>that you say okay if this doesn't work<br>out uh what's my plan b have i set<br>enough assets uh aside that i can<br>rebuild<br>because yeah you don't want to be wiped<br>out but you know so badly that you can't<br>start again so<br>yes look um the people who are seriously<br>wealthy are the ones that have taken a<br>lot of risk the ones that are most<br>successful are the ones that don't uh<br>risk absolutely everything so that's how<br>i would really summarize it so you be<br>prepared to give it a go but do it in a<br>in a kind of a safe way<br>do your homework<br>yeah<br>reflecting on that it sounds like the<br>the safe deposit box almost um<br>the degree of conservatism or carving<br>off a<br>a fullback plan actually empowers you to<br>take more risk because you know you know<br>you can take<br>that's right and also keeps your other<br>family members happy as well you know<br>i've seen you know marriages fall apart<br>because you know one person wants to<br>risk everything and the other one's a<br>lot more conservative so you know by by<br>having that safety net you know you<br>you're bringing other people with you<br>especially your spouse or a you know<br>close family member so it's a good idea<br>to you know just have that safety net<br>there<br>thank you it sounds like billy joe might<br>have been through that i can imagine and<br>can i um stuart i'm gonna um<br>come to you in a moment on<br>cryptocurrency but you you also<br>talk a lot with people uh who are<br>considering how to<br>spread i guess a portfolio of<br>investments and so on so just on that<br>last point that liz raised<br>how what kind of conversations do you<br>have when you're in discussion about how<br>to manage risk levels and so on<br>yeah look matt it's the biggest part of<br>what we do when you're setting up an<br>investment portfolio is to understand an<br>investor's risk tolerance<br>so a lot of that is understanding um<br>aspects of their own asset base of<br>figuring out what assets they already<br>hold<br>are they already heavily exposed to<br>property or forestry or farming<br>et cetera<br>and then just going through a series of<br>questions to really get our head around<br>what their general risk tolerance is<br>like what kind of moves in the market<br>can they tolerate um also understanding<br>what their requirements are yeah how<br>much income do they need off their<br>portfolio what certainty do they need do<br>they have capital projects coming up are<br>they planning on you know buying a batch<br>or another property in a few years time<br>and therefore need a degree of certainty<br>around that so there are lots of<br>questions that frame the development of<br>a portfolio and what that drives is what<br>we call an asset allocation so how much<br>should they have in shares how much<br>should they have in property how much<br>should they have in fixed interest or<br>bonds and the different degree that you<br>have in those assets is depending on the<br>answers to those questions if you need<br>much more certainty of income or capital<br>you have a reasonable degree of exposure<br>to fixed interest<br>if you are in a position in your life<br>where you're looking to try and grow<br>your capital base as much as possible<br>and you don't have any upcoming capital<br>requirements maybe you're younger and<br>you you have good earnings then you can<br>focus more on the growth assets your<br>shares and your property there's there's<br>a lot to discuss and it's very personal<br>um so every client will be slightly<br>different we don't believe that everyone<br>just fits in these boxes<br>and it's something that's also very<br>fluid so as you go on over the years<br>your your risk tolerance may change and<br>it might be because of personal<br>circumstances or it might be because a<br>market event flushes out what your true<br>risk tolerance is so for example with<br>what's happened in the past couple of<br>months in investment markets clients<br>that thought they could cope with risk<br>quite comfortably<br>we're starting to find that maybe their<br>risk tolerance isn't quite what they<br>thought it was when they go through an<br>actual event and their money's you know<br>invested<br>um so lots of questions around that that<br>determine what a portfolio looks like<br>but just touching on on that last<br>question as well on failure<br>you know that's something we spend a lot<br>of time analyzing as well all companies<br>come under pressure and have situations<br>that<br>um that are tough on them<br>and we put a lot of credence on the<br>quality of management on how they deal<br>with those challenging times so when we<br>analyze the company we're looking at the<br>company but we also look at the<br>management and how they cope with bad<br>times<br>and that to us says a lot about that<br>company and the management team going<br>forward<br>you know classic example i always<br>remember back in the early 90s michael<br>hill you know was was doing really well<br>in the jewellery sector<br>and they decided to try and diversify<br>and get into shoes and they actually<br>opened michael hill shoes as an add-on<br>to michael hill jewelry stores<br>and it was a disaster<br>you know they really misunderstood the<br>market and<br>that part of the business started losing<br>money very very quickly but the quality<br>of management to recognize that got it<br>wrong<br>you know cut it focus back on what their<br>core business was and what their<br>strength was and recover to us that was<br>a really good sign of good quality<br>management so you can learn from failure<br>yeah really really interesting and i<br>if we were never failing it would imply<br>that we're probably not um taking<br>sufficient risk to get to an optimal<br>outcome you know we're playing too far<br>within the boundary if um if we would<br>never risk failure<br>yeah and i think different cultures look<br>at failure differently i think in new<br>zealand we're all about you know you<br>feel a bit bad about if things go wrong<br>and an american business<br>they almost wear like a badge of honor<br>um that they tried and failed but at<br>least i tried to to really you know go<br>for it and it didn't work out and i<br>picked myself up and carry on so but<br>it's interesting how we view failure<br>yeah<br>yeah there's a lot of<br>psychology and culture in there all<br>right so speaking of psychology uh<br>cryptocurrencies and um<br>there was a question that we had here<br>which i think is almost impossible for<br>you to answer you know are they a solid<br>investment or are they fed and you know<br>where i think that the future's<br>the only way to find out the answer but<br>what's your take i guess on<br>cryptocurrencies digital currencies<br>and the movement towards investments and<br>those and even volatility in the last<br>few weeks what are you what are you<br>seeing on the analysis there yeah so<br>look i actually think the question of is<br>cryptocurrency a fad or something we<br>should take seriously<br>and is it a good investment are quite<br>separate<br>um and i think that's where people get a<br>bit unstuck<br>uh they think they need to be in this<br>cryptocurrency market because well<br>that's apparently what you should do and<br>it's going to be the future<br>um but<br>look cryptocurrency and digital currency<br>um<br>blockchain technology<br>from a technology point of view look<br>that may develop into something that<br>becomes the future and you're right<br>we're only going to know that with the<br>benefit of of history but we've seen<br>lots of industries where that's happened<br>you know you look right back to the<br>combustion engine<br>automobile a lot of people thought that<br>was ridiculous and would never replace<br>the horse and cart and it became one of<br>the biggest technological changes of our<br>your life<br>but from an investment point of view you<br>know there was something like 80<br>year-old automobile manufacturers in the<br>states in the 1930s i think<br>well that got whittled down to about<br>four by the late 90s and most of those<br>round overseas because they're all going<br>broke so<br>what is<br>a great technological change and could<br>be a huge influence doesn't necessarily<br>mean it's a great investment<br>and the other issue is that<br>cryptocurrency like any<br>we would class it more as a commodity<br>type asset<br>that people are buying basically hoping<br>that tomorrow someone is willing to pay<br>a bit more for it than made it but<br>that's no different to a lot of metals<br>like gold or silver or standard currency<br>that's speculating on an asset and we<br>don't really view that as investment<br>investing to us is buying something that<br>has the power to generate a return in<br>its own right so buying a business or a<br>property where you know the rent from<br>the property or the dividends from the<br>company can generate that return<br>regardless of what the value of the<br>assets doing but i think people need to<br>understand really what they're doing are<br>they investing or are they speculating<br>on an asset<br>really thought thank you<br>i'm gonna stay with technology but link<br>it back into your world jen so<br>um there were questions here about<br>what opportunities or disruption<br>blockchain might bring into the real<br>estate market but<br>more broadly what are you seeing in<br>terms of disruptive trends from<br>technology as it relates to the real<br>estate market<br>um<br>a lot so uh interestingly so i was in<br>real estate for 10 years and then 2017<br>stepped out and came back in four years<br>later and i just can't believe the<br>amount of technology investment that has<br>happened in this industry in that four<br>years um you know particularly around uh<br>covert 19.<br>you know<br>real estate like every other industry<br>had the handbrake pulled on on the 23rd<br>of march 2020 and had to adapt really<br>really quickly and so a lot of firms<br>invested enormous amounts of time and<br>energy and money um into their<br>technology and<br>it has just come along in leaps and<br>bounds i mean the really obvious and<br>most public one will be online auctions<br>um and how that uh you know enabled<br>enormous amounts of real estate to be<br>transacted over the period of the<br>pandemic um but yeah one of the things<br>that we've been talking about a lot is<br>what is the industry of the future and<br>how do we start thinking about what that<br>is going to look like for real estate<br>agents and for new zealanders who are<br>looking to buy and sell real estate so<br>we partnered with um the real estate<br>institute australia and um did a piece<br>of work with the blockchain innovation<br>hub at rmit uh in melbourne<br>um on exactly that what what is what is<br>the opportunity in the space and you<br>know it's interesting how we tend to you<br>know it's really early days in this<br>technology and we tend to put blockchain<br>and cryptocurrency together as it almost<br>has a single thing um but you know i<br>think that the crypto piece is the it's<br>the sexy interesting piece it gets the<br>media attention um in fact there's a<br>some<br>recent media about a property that uh<br>you can buy in cryptocurrency there's<br>actually been um a recently i think a<br>deal that was half done in bitcoin so<br>you know it's starting to become<br>something people are thinking about in<br>new zealand um i of course bought<br>bitcoin when it was 68 000<br>um a coin so when it's a million dollars<br>i'll feel better about like how i feel<br>about it right now um but i think like<br>stuart said it's speculation uh but i<br>think that underlying blockchain chain<br>technology if it becomes the internet of<br>the future if it really becomes the kind<br>of technology that we use in our lives<br>in general that is when we'll see the<br>disruption<br>you know i think in our world there's a<br>thing that you have to go through when<br>you do a real estate transaction that is<br>part of the anti-money laundering<br>legislation in new zealand you know i<br>look at that and i think that is just<br>credentials if i can own my own digital<br>credentials on a blockchain it's<br>completely transparent and immutable and<br>i can be in control of that i can just<br>give them to you i don't then need a<br>third party aml provider to do that you<br>know it's those kinds of things that you<br>know seem like little pain points but um<br>when you take cryptocurrency away and<br>think about the actual use of blockchain<br>it's those sorts of things that i think<br>you know in the short term will make<br>that difference um but i think we can't<br>you know if if this ends up being a<br>thing like the internet was<br>i think we probably can't conceive of<br>what life in a blockchain world will<br>look like just yet<br>yeah the um<br>the the march of time has never kind to<br>our um the inside of our previous selves<br>you know it's yeah<br>i think one of the one of the things<br>that is quite interesting um is in terms<br>of the it opens up decentralized finance<br>and the ability for fractional ownership<br>of assets like real estate so if we<br>start thinking about you know<br>conversations around affordability um<br>you know you might not have 10 friends<br>that want to go<br>uh 10th in a property but you might be<br>able to find 100 strangers and you know<br>and have a fractional piece of property<br>all over the world potentially and that<br>you know really changes the game for<br>real estate and for property investment<br>um<br>yeah that's very interesting can i i'm<br>thinking then slightly<br>i'm thinking of the concept of time then<br>and<br>how we consider investments<br>might pass back to you lives for a<br>moment<br>when you look over say the next 20 years<br>are there any<br>industries sectors asset classes that<br>you think are particularly attractive to<br>invest in and then more broadly<br>how do you think about uh the changes<br>and you reference this a little bit with<br>a hundred thousand dollar question to<br>start but how do you think about the<br>changes and the kinds of investments you<br>might make over the next 20 years of<br>anybody's career um you know depending<br>on where they are in their life journey<br>okay well i think the the theme going<br>forward i mean you know 20 years that's<br>a long time who knows what it was going<br>to be like in 20 years whether we'll<br>still be here even if uh<br>putin does they but um i think you know<br>the big theme for me is environmental<br>sustainability and if you look at you<br>know there is an absolute um growing<br>trend for people to put their money into<br>businesses and industries where<br>environmental sustainability is um a key<br>focus so i that's where i think you're<br>going to see a lot of money is heading<br>down that track<br>um<br>in terms of um<br>other sectors i think you know we've<br>we've still got the the baby boom is<br>aging and i think there's going to be a<br>lot of you know in terms of health care<br>there's going to have to be a lot of<br>innovation and investment in that<br>particular sector<br>you've got your standard ones of<br>infrastructure that's always a good<br>standby kind of solid things but your<br>technology i mean who knows where that's<br>going to go i mean we all know that the<br>rate of change in technology is just<br>exponential so over 20 years period i<br>mean to be things that develop that we<br>you know just beyond our comprehension<br>right now so but i i think you know with<br>those kinds of things as we were talking<br>about before with bitcoin you know they<br>tend to be more on the speculative end<br>of things rather than core investment<br>and i think so where they belong in a<br>portfolio is perhaps at the sort of the<br>dabbling end you know they're the sort<br>of things where you might want to put<br>your toe in the water and have a go and<br>i'll sit and say that about things like<br>nfts i should say<br>um<br>uh you know they're the sort of things<br>that you might want to dabble in just to<br>kind of learn about and and and see how<br>they go over time but you wouldn't want<br>to necessarily make them a cool part of<br>your investment so<br>you always be keeping an eye on the<br>technology space in terms of you know<br>that's where you might get you know you<br>might strike it lucky and and find that<br>one thing that's going to<br>make you a serious lot of money um but<br>it comes along with high risk so um yeah<br>it's always you know better with<br>hindsight to just so you know the big<br>winners are<br>really hard to pick them in advance but<br>i certainly think there is a really<br>rising trend you know in this whole esg<br>space<br>ethical investing you know there's going<br>to be huge pressure i think going<br>forward on<br>on particular companies but also<br>industries to take really take that on<br>board and and the ones who are going to<br>attract the funding will be the ones<br>that do take it seriously<br>um<br>thank you and strong theme there and<br>expect to what you said earlier stuart<br>about you know essentially having a<br>degree of balance across your asset<br>allocations and thinking about different<br>risk profiles when you<br>when you go into<br>something depending on what stage you're<br>out of line<br>yeah and even with an asset um<br>allocations or than the classes having a<br>degree diversification and<br>diversification is such an important<br>thing across any form of invisa<br>um you know not having too many eggs in<br>one basket because you just don't know<br>what the future holds when you can focus<br>on core fundamentals sectors you know<br>necessities of life<br>food and energy and health care and you<br>would think that over time you should be<br>you should do well<br>but yeah technology is a<br>space that we know is going to become<br>more important over time but we don't<br>know exactly who the winners will be so<br>having a decent spirit of coverage<br>nestle said you know what we call it<br>thrill capital so we tell clients if you<br>want to get into something that's a bit<br>different call it your thrill capital um<br>but you you reinvent it it's a small<br>part of your portfolio and we'd be quite<br>disciplined about how much exposure you<br>have to those types of types of sectors<br>it's a great that's a great term i'll<br>use that uh<br>i might link down to you billy<br>so liz mentioned<br>you know if you were going to choose i<br>guess mega trends then the move towards<br>environmental sustainability is clearly<br>one you've<br>taken a career turn into<br>business ventures linked to<br>environmental sustainability can you<br>talk<br>well i think probably it's appropriate<br>you can do the shameless plug for your<br>uh for your business and your product<br>but i know you've got a huge mission<br>and also just how you've transitioned<br>into thinking about business as a means<br>to have impact as as well as create well<br>yeah well we<br>do we launched our business late 2018<br>but we registered in 2019 and it was<br>literally born out of the vision for<br>sustainability<br>so<br>my company's b day we've created a wet<br>wipe alternative so it's a natural foam<br>that pumps onto toilet paper or tissue<br>and turns it into a flushable cleansing<br>gentle wipe<br>so we've got that visual there everybody<br>so<br>as we know wet wipes are being used for<br>hygiene needs down there<br>and more and more people are flushing<br>them which is creating huge damage<br>across the wastewater infrastructure and<br>also for the environment<br>how i came about it i was actually at<br>waikato university<br>studying and i i came up with the<br>concept then so really by the time we<br>launched the product it really had 20<br>years of r d<br>um<br>and it wasn't until my kids uh um kind<br>of changed the formula to to really what<br>it is today but i absolutely agree liz<br>um it's a global movement the whole<br>sustainability for products and and<br>thinking about you know it's not only<br>the bottom line it really is a push and<br>a move and a conscious movement<br>for products um in the way we do<br>business<br>to limit our<br>footprint with whether it be carbon<br>whether it be pollution plastic<br>so you know we're in our fourth year of<br>trading<br>i'm so proud of where we are today we<br>are still trading and i i still believe<br>we're in a start-up phase just because<br>you know with cover three years taking<br>us out it's really kind of limited our<br>ability to get over overseas<br>um<br>but there's a real movement in that<br>space um so we uh yeah we're at an<br>exciting time and we we're looking for<br>investors<br>put that plug out there but um i think<br>you know we we've gone through our our<br>um lots of failures and it is a test but<br>it's it's been<br>you know thrown<br>at us because we've been through a<br>worldwide pandemic and still going<br>through it but um<br>yeah um totally love the journey but it<br>definitely is about sustainability and<br>i'd like to also<br>say like in 20 years time definitely<br>around the wellness space<br>i think we just you know we're becoming<br>um more mentally<br>drained and kind of psychologically<br>damaged right and we've got to say these<br>things that sit right in front of us are<br>just<br>the you know it's creating a different<br>way to and i think<br>that's that space where we're going to<br>have to really<br>find<br>oh we've got to have to have time off<br>devices really and that's going to be<br>hard because we've got a whole<br>generation<br>that it just glued to devices but<br>definitely wellness food energy<br>for us to really think about as a nation<br>and in their innovation space<br>which is a huge<br>a huge thing here you know university at<br>the waikato management school we talk a<br>lot about<br>empowering people to grow thriving<br>businesses but those thriving businesses<br>have to<br>well they sit within a thriving society<br>and they have to contribute towards that<br>and that thriving society sits within a<br>thriving ecosystem a thriving natural<br>world<br>and<br>we do see that you've got to you've got<br>to<br>create value across all those all those<br>realms you can't you can't purely just<br>trade them off against each other<br>i'm<br>um i might stay with you there but<br>others would have a view on this we um<br>we often<br>hear a little bit about you know the<br>need for<br>new zealand altera i think to become<br>more productive and there's a whole<br>bunch of different ways into this but<br>when you look at<br>our economy this this leads into wealth<br>creation and investment certainly as<br>well what kind of startups do you think<br>we need or what kind of investments do<br>you think we need as a country that our<br>opportunities for individuals to invest<br>but also you know areas that we as a<br>nation should be investing in to grow<br>definitely ones that grow gdp so have<br>that exports<br>um the we need to be exporting to make<br>money so<br>anything that has kind of a global lens<br>that is that is unique that is<br>licensable that we can we can really<br>distribute<br>um<br>you know where tourism numbers are down<br>so we can't really you know we can't<br>really sell to tourists at the moment so<br>it's definitely we've got to look to<br>overseas and whether it's you know in<br>technology<br>um you know but we've also also got to<br>be mindful we're going to maintain our<br>ip and lock it up because that is so<br>unique to altera so<br>it's a it's a tricky balance there<br>that's right and anybody else have<br>strong views on that one otherwise keep<br>going yeah look i think and it's<br>interesting i was talking to some people<br>not from the mighty waikato uh this<br>morning and trying to give them a bit of<br>an update as to you know<br>something we see locally all the time is<br>that people not from this region still<br>associate uh this area with being mostly<br>agricultural based or uh you know the<br>old cow town but yeah the development of<br>technology businesses especially out of<br>hamilton has been separate um certainly<br>from what i've seen in my time here in<br>the last you know 25 odd years um and<br>that sector is such a powerful sector<br>for new zealand because it is<br>um as billy joe said you know that<br>you talk about adding to gb gdp you know<br>technology businesses um are huge with<br>regards to the margins they can create<br>and how quickly and easily they can<br>expand overseas without the need for<br>massive physical infrastructure so um i<br>think likely we're doing a great job at<br>diversifying away from yeah the rural<br>economy will still be our backbone but i<br>think yeah this uh region is so much<br>um right i might um i'll ask<br>a couple of um tactical questions for<br>those that are thinking about how to uh<br>how to grow their wealth and how to go<br>about it and first one it's probably for<br>you staying with you stewart and also<br>liz i think you might have some news on<br>this so people are thinking of investing<br>um do it yourself online there's plenty<br>of<br>options for people to go and become<br>traders on the phone<br>on the sofa or using a broker what do<br>you think provides the best return and a<br>holistic sense of return risk for the<br>whole the whole piece i suspect i might<br>know where you go stuart but<br>uh yeah you probably would but um look<br>it's it's horses for courses i guess the<br>main difference to really understand is<br>um<br>your ability to do the research and the<br>analysis yourself versus getting someone<br>else to do it for you<br>uh i mean things like um you know<br>hatched and cheers et cetera like yeah<br>they've allowed people to on their own<br>um have a look and start experiencing<br>the world of investing and doing it for<br>relatively small amounts of money um<br>which is a positive for people starting<br>to build your knowledge overall but i<br>guess what we find<br>is that one of the biggest risks to<br>investing is actually<br>uh people's emotions um you know there's<br>a great book written by benjamin graham<br>called the intelligent investor in the<br>40s and the lessons he tries to instill<br>in investors are still soaking in today<br>the biggest risk people buy is yourself<br>you know it's not so much about the<br>things you invest in it's your own human<br>behavior and markets can be driven by<br>fear and greed very much in short term<br>and that leads to people making mistakes<br>um and the benefit of a full service uh<br>invested in firm like us is our job<br>really is as much part of it's picking<br>the right investments but a huge part of<br>it is making sure clients don't make you<br>know human mistakes and their emotions<br>overtake sensibilities we saw a great<br>example of that you know when code first<br>had in 2020 uh and a lot of people that<br>had diy he was saved for funds etc um<br>you know thought the sky was falling and<br>immediately<br>shifted their exposure from maybe a high<br>growth portfolio to a conservative<br>portfolio fearing the worst um whereas<br>if they were long-term investors needed<br>plenty of time the best strategy would<br>have been just weighted out and in fact<br>tried to chip away and add to it as<br>markets below markets rebounded very<br>very quickly and before they knew it the<br>markets were above where they exited and<br>then they were stuck in a situation of<br>not really knowing what to do so yep<br>great for people having a bit of a play<br>and starting to develop their knowledge<br>um but you've got to be wary of you know<br>not having the expertise and skills to<br>do it properly<br>um excellent thank you and it reminds me<br>i just<br>listened to a very long<br>interview session with a guy morgan<br>houselord whoso i think<br>who's uh written a book recently called<br>the psychology of money and fascinating<br>it's on it's on my um it's on my<br>purchase list because the way that the<br>emotional side that you talked about<br>um and<br>the degree to which you think you can<br>absorb risk when risk isn't happening<br>versus actually going through the<br>experience<br>and what decisions you make turn out not<br>to be the ones that you you promised<br>yourself you would make when it wasn't<br>yeah i spent half my time being an<br>investment uh analyst and advisor and<br>half my time being a guidance counselor<br>and psychologist clients it's um it's<br>fascinating<br>excellent and um liz what's have you got<br>any views on that about how to think of<br>you know doing it yourself and using<br>advisors or brokers specifically well i<br>think you need to decide if you're going<br>to be a speculator or a long-term<br>investor you know there's nothing wrong<br>with having a devil yourself if you want<br>to you know try your luck on on a few<br>investments but for the long term the<br>key driver of return and risk is asset<br>allocation and you know you need to be<br>in a diversified portfolio and really<br>understanding asset allocation and the<br>art of rebalancing your portfolio it's<br>not something that your average person<br>knows a lot about and that's where your<br>advisor can really add a lot of value is<br>in terms of<br>advising you on that asset allocation<br>honestly you find<br>you know stock picking adds a small<br>amount of value to a portfolio but the<br>key driver is you know how much you've<br>got invested in shares versus property<br>versus um<br>fixed interest in cash you know and and<br>that's the thing to really get right and<br>what you need to manage over your<br>lifespan<br>really interesting<br>all right i'm<br>going to stay with the uh the tactical<br>practical<br>side and jen for those<br>engaged in the national conversation<br>about property investment um<br>what are you<br>seeing in terms of locations and also<br>types of investments or that might be<br>current or it might be a<br>recent what have you seen work and what<br>have you seen go wrong in terms of<br>people investing in a property could be<br>a could be a town in new zealand that's<br>working it could actually be<br>something village oh you raised you know<br>you want to be in that place doing the<br>inspections yourself that of course<br>works if you're approximate not so easy<br>all the time and it could also be the<br>types of property are you seeing people<br>invest in in units and apartments newer<br>older<br>town houses uh larger properties what<br>what have you seen work and fail i feel<br>like my answer to all of that is yes<br>all of that<br>there's i just think there's it's so<br>dependent on what you're into and what<br>you're looking to achieve and the kinds<br>of properties that you understand and<br>you know i just think about you know the<br>question about even where<br>um i would always say<br>buy in a market that you know<br>so for me i've lived in auckland i've<br>lived in hamilton so like those are<br>markets that i would buy in if i thought<br>that there was property in i had like i<br>don't know telpo um that would be useful<br>i would make sure that i did an enormous<br>amount of research to really understand<br>what was going on in that market because<br>it's not a space that i know well i<br>don't know where the good areas are i<br>don't know where tenants want to live<br>where the schools are all of that sort<br>of thing and so it really comes down to<br>and i think that's been touched on<br>really understanding<br>why you're investing like what that<br>property investment is all about um<br>really is the point number one like is<br>it really just about capital gain and<br>are you looking to buy somewhere at the<br>bottom of the market and hope um that<br>the property market goes up make sure<br>you know that that market in particular<br>is underpriced and in order to know that<br>you you really have to dig under the<br>hood you know that's not something that<br>that is on the front page of the paper<br>you know these are these are things that<br>take years to understand in terms of the<br>detail around different markets it's<br>kind of like you know the different<br>types of the different shares and the<br>different asset allocation buying<br>commercial property in tokurawa is very<br>different to buying commercial property<br>in nelson<br>you know and which market is right for<br>you<br>probably the market that you know best<br>the market that you have the best<br>connections in we've got the best<br>relationships with the experts you know<br>it's those sorts of things um what we<br>have seen though is because the<br>government changed the rules around uh<br>the tax deductibility we have seen<br>a much more attraction for investors to<br>new belts and um you know we've seen<br>across the last four or five years<br>record numbers of consents across new<br>zealand particularly in those high<br>growth areas including around the<br>waikato<br>and you're seeing a whole load of<br>intensification so lots of townhouses<br>lots of duplexes<br>slowly some apartments it would be great<br>to see some more of those in hamilton i<br>would say that um<br>and so and property both property<br>investors and people looking to live in<br>those properties are interested in those<br>properties because they had a different<br>price point<br>but importantly had a different<br>lifestyle point and i think that when<br>you're buying property for yourself or<br>for tenants people are making property<br>decisions about their lives the property<br>you know for the investor it's about the<br>property but for the people that live in<br>it it's about the life they want to live<br>so different typologies are attractive<br>to different types of investor different<br>types of tenants and there is much much<br>more variety<br>around now which is a really positive<br>thing for um you know the needs of new<br>all right we're getting near the end<br>another question i'd like to ask you all<br>before we uh wrap up and i'll give us a<br>closing round as well after that so<br>um<br>that's the property side if we could<br>invest in property this is the inverse<br>if we if we've got somebody who couldn't<br>invest in property or at least they<br>believed they couldn't<br>what would you advise<br>they put their money into it it's a<br>little bit like the opening question<br>what what why you put your money into if<br>you thought you couldn't get into the<br>property<br>space you just couldn't make the believe<br>you didn't have enough uh i might start<br>with you billy joe<br>um<br>i<br>yourself education<br>one um that would be a biggie so you<br>yeah you can always get a masters um and<br>then turn it into summer mba is really<br>good<br>good investment on that one um otherwise<br>i yeah it shares but i would go to<br>stuart because you know he'd put your<br>money into a portfolio that kind of had<br>global and local reach as opposed to you<br>going and saying sharesies and going oh<br>look i'm going to invest in that tech<br>company and then who knows so i think<br>play the long game anything you go in<br>with play the long game if you have an<br>expertise in something or a passion it<br>might be umbrellas<br>buy some umbrellas off alibaba sell them<br>put people's you know like branding just<br>just find a niche and find something you<br>you'll<br>yeah these products that people need<br>here in alterador um you can start from<br>there and go wider and become container<br>door who knows<br>you you've displayed your deep uh bias<br>towards entrepreneurialism there that's<br>brilliant<br>liz where what would you uh advise<br>i would absolutely set up my own<br>business if i couldn't buy a property<br>you know the the key to wealth is<br>leveraging<br>if you're just an employee and trying to<br>save out of your income you're basically<br>going to get<br>nowhere really you know i mean it's a<br>long hard graft i mean it is really<br>important to do that as well but if you<br>seriously want to make a lot of wealth<br>you've either got to<br>get big time into property or big climb<br>into running your own business and i<br>would have a serious think about that<br>you know<br>you know it's not that hard to think of<br>something that you can<br>make money in you know there's that many<br>opportunities out there now there's a<br>lot of people that will help you there's<br>a lot of government funding available<br>even<br>so why not give it a go you know we are<br>an entrepreneurial nation you know<br>where i live in i'm currently living in<br>culture you know and but not we have a<br>huge uh percentage of self-employed<br>people here and you know people who are<br>running<br>global businesses out of their<br>back bedrooms you know i<br>it's it's doable you know just um<br>think of something that that really you<br>know<br>uh you you do feel passionate about you<br>have an interest in uh and<br>um and and give it a go um but you know<br>what that safety is approaching from the<br>area if you're not keen on that if it's<br>if it's not for you then i would invest<br>in shares it's got to be in a growth<br>asset you know you you have to keep<br>ahead of inflation you're not going to<br>do that by saving money in the bank so<br>it's it's got to go either into<br>property into shares or into your own<br>business if you really want to get it<br>here you get left behind if you don't do<br>yeah look um<br>i i think billy joe was talking to her<br>20 or herself and she was saying i kind<br>of felt like you were talking to me<br>yourself<br>many years ago about what you you do um<br>that was cool but yeah look i think<br>investing in growth assets is critical<br>and doing it when you're young um is a<br>real benefit you know the early start<br>not only do you learn more about<br>investing but you get the best thing the<br>power to do its job which is all about<br>compounding returns over time um the<br>tricky bit is when you're in your 20s<br>you don't really know what is it and you<br>might think right now i'm never going to<br>get into property i'm not going to buy a<br>house<br>so yeah you set up an investment<br>portfolio where you go and start a<br>business but your situation is quite<br>fluid when you're younger um so you<br>should be in a position if you're<br>earning um you've got a job you've got<br>your career reviewing ahead of you to be<br>as growth oriented as you possibly can<br>and take the most risks when you're<br>young because you've got time to recover<br>from them and learn from them but you do<br>need to constantly be just checking back<br>in with yourself<br>we encourage people every year no matter<br>how old you are to reassess your risk<br>tolerance and race allocation has<br>anything changed is anything coming up<br>you know maybe in two years time<br>suddenly you are<br>look looking at buying a house and then<br>you need to change what your asset base<br>is to make sure you've got enough<br>capital protected<br>where it is so<br>yeah look i think building on on the<br>answers beforehand you should be going<br>for growth um but you you always need to<br>sort of check what your situation is<br>here by you<br>brilliant<br>all right we are going to do a rapid<br>fire last round question so a short<br>answer and i want you to think<br>that the goal of this is to build<br>people's capabilities so they can go and<br>take action better better action in<br>their lives<br>what is a top tip<br>that you would provide to somebody in<br>order to grow their own wealth in the<br>framework we said at the start<br>um<br>and it might be something uh the best<br>piece of advice that you've received or<br>it could be the tip that you wish you<br>had got earlier in your career<br>but uh roundtable what's the what's your<br>top tip for people growing their wealth<br>gonna start with you jen<br>uh i would probably say like there's an<br>old adage in real estate that the best<br>time to buy property is today and the<br>second best time is tomorrow and i think<br>that the same is true about<br>thinking about your financial future the<br>best time to start thinking about it and<br>doing something about it is today<br>and so don't put it off like start when<br>you're start when you're young it'll be<br>worth it when you're 50 60 70.<br>brilliant thank you<br>billy joe<br>i would say if you don't have a deposit<br>budget budget budget<br>my big top tip is get that bottle of<br>mount difficulty in every party that you<br>go to fill it up with reunite wine no<br>one knows you turn up with that forty<br>dollar fifty dollar bottle<br>that you'd save from your auntie's house<br>and fill it up with the cheapest wine<br>honestly it's budget anything you can do<br>to save money and make it a game like<br>know where every cent goes and you will<br>save that deposit seriously it'll become<br>like a yeah every cent and every budget<br>tips and and do it in a group you know<br>find find your tribe like when you start<br>business find your tribe find people who<br>want a budget too<br>and fill up really expensive wine<br>bottles with cheap wine<br>love it extremely practical<br>let's do it<br>you know i guess similar to um the two<br>previous answers make a start i mean as<br>i've talked about in previous tanza yeah<br>the jewel of investing is compounding<br>returns and how it works is the longer<br>you're investing the more you make it's<br>a snowball and it builds and builds and<br>builds so the earlier you start<br>hopefully the more you're going to make<br>it a long period of time so<br>make a start get some skill in the game<br>um feel how uh how it works and the<br>emotions kick in you know yeah it's it's<br>all a learning process um and and on the<br>back of that talk to kids about it you<br>know if you're an adult you're making a<br>starkey kids involved talk to them it's<br>a real lack of understanding about<br>investments<br>at a younger age in new zealand we don't<br>do a good job of educating our kids at<br>intermediate and high school about<br>property and shares in the world of<br>investing<br>and if they had that knowledge base at<br>that level they would be in a much<br>better position to make a start in their<br>20s and 30s when they ran into money<br>yeah great great point thank you<br>and last word liz<br>okay so over the last 20 or so years<br>i've spent a lot of time talking to<br>people just you know before the point of<br>retirement and the ones that have<br>successfully built a lot of wealth over<br>their working lives have had two<br>characteristics in common one is they<br>have consistently spent less than what<br>they've earned in other words then<br>really good budget is always saved<br>and secondly they've stayed out of<br>short-term debt that's credit cards<br>school cards all that kind of thing<br>you know<br>that's the key thing i would like to<br>really drive money for people is get<br>into that habit of spending less than<br>you earned<br>because you know money doesn't come out<br>of thin air you've got to have a deposit<br>for something you've got to have savings<br>you've got to have spare cash you've got<br>to have an emergency fund<br>the only way you're going to build up<br>your reservoir<br>is if you are spending less than what<br>you're earning and it doesn't take much<br>you can start out small<br>even if it's ten dollars a week and just<br>grow from there but get into that habit<br>of um having some surplus and and not<br>going into short-term debt it's just so<br>so vitally important<br>excellent<br>uh i'll wrap up now thank you so much um<br>brilliant insights all around mixture of<br>philosophical psychological and deeply<br>practical which is i think what we need<br>for a topic like this so<br>um thank you once again stuart billy joe<br>jen liz i've really enjoyed the<br>conversation that's uh prompted me to do<br>some uh do some thinking i'm sure it<br>will for many others as well so we<br>really appreciate your time and uh and<br>your expertise so kyoto thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
