on<br>okay i apparently have to press play on<br>this i chose otago because it's<br>nice and close to home i can still<br>remind you<br>thank you<br>cool would you better look after it for<br>a wee minute i've just got to do this<br>video and then i'll be able to come find<br>it with you<br>uh kia ora my name is kane johnson my<br>name is erica coolmer<br>um my name is sami hi i'm alicia de<br>corsi i am a third year student doing<br>the bachelor of teaching endorsing<br>primary education<br>i think the really great thing about the<br>college of education is the fact that<br>the lecturers are always available for<br>you so you can go and ask for help or<br>guidance or just anything really and i<br>think that's what makes the college of<br>education really special the topoka unit<br>is an opportunity for anybody to be part<br>of<br>whether you're tawiwi your maori or<br>pacifica it doesn't matter it's not just<br>about speaking moldy it's about the<br>concepts and ideas behind it and giving<br>you a better<br>a better world view i guess of of tao<br>maori and how we can incorporate that<br>and it's something to be<br>celebrated and not afraid of the early<br>childhood program involves a bit of<br>class time which is<br>lectures tutorials and workshops<br>you do that usually about four days a<br>week then you get put in an early<br>childhood centre and<br>yeah that's sort of when you get to put<br>into practice everything you've learned<br>in class ah good work placement's been<br>awesome um<br>i find that i've been learning a lot<br>more very quickly in my time here and<br>also has been good pairing up with<br>teachers with mental teachers to help us<br>who are quite young in the profession<br>quite fresh to be able to practice and<br>develop our pedagogies too once you get<br>into the school and you're in the class<br>environment you really realise why<br>you're doing the degree the kids<br>absolutely love having student teachers<br>and it gives you a chance to<br>experience life as a teacher you see how<br>busy it is but also how amazing it is<br>especially when you see students make<br>progress or you realize that you have a<br>really cool impact on their life<br>can't speak highly enough of their<br>lecturers and the support that we get<br>and also from the students that you're<br>uh you're working alongside as well yeah<br>yeah we'll go with one of that and then<br>you're building that sense of whanau and<br>getting each other through<br>in terms of the lecturers they are very<br>helpful very informative very<br>knowledgeable people<br>and it's awesome to know that if we are<br>struggling that we are able to approach<br>them on a more<br>pastoral conversation that's very<br>comforting and very reassuring for a<br>student who's not from here there wasn't<br>ever really another option for me i<br>always wanted to come to otago<br>with the ousa<br>at their events and things like that<br>brings you into the whole dunedin<br>experience i think and<br>another map on your map yeah i did oh i<br>can see you did it there in there<br>that doesn't matter<br>okay<br>so it's a beautiful video and some of<br>the stars of the video you'll meet<br>tonight<br>so one of the things is is it really is<br>uh thank you anne it is really a<br>supportive learning environment so um i<br>think anywhere in the university of<br>otago is quite supportive but<br>particularly at the college of education<br>there's a really strong pastoral care<br>emphasis and we'll talk a little bit<br>more about that um<br>one of our graduates said the sense of<br>community created through this room of<br>course is exceptional and we know this<br>because teaching is about relationships<br>so the relationships we have with our<br>students and the relationships that we<br>want our students in our class or our<br>early childhood setting to<br>really foster with each other as well as<br>with the kayak or the teachers<br>um placement type<br>you have a so you're coming to the<br>university to do your courses and your<br>classes but you also spend a lot of time<br>out in depending on your sector early<br>childhood setting or your school so so<br>it really is um sort of an iterative<br>interactive process between the school<br>and in the college and it is fun um a<br>lot of people in uni i've never heard my<br>daughter say that i don't want to go to<br>class today but it's it's not the same<br>um according to the college of education<br>students<br>the just to talk a little bit more about<br>uh pastoral care so<br>every program and every program has<br>a program coordinator that you'll meet<br>tonight and they are responsible for the<br>pastoral care within that program and it<br>really is a family and looking after<br>like a family but we also have another<br>a group of people that are really<br>important uh we have a pacifica<br>coordinator karina nafatali and the<br>beautiful purple shirt tonight uh it's<br>samoan language week so she's not able<br>to be with us tonight she's got a lot on<br>in the samoan community and then we have<br>um<br>rachel who martin who leads a group of<br>kaiafina and the the gentleman on the<br>right hand side of that picture is going<br>i need to use this because of the um<br>very good<br>am i heard<br>nice to see everybody<br>so yeah a bit of a surprise to see<br>myself up there uh that happens all<br>those surprises uh so uh yeah there are<br>many levels of um keeping tabs on people<br>and kaifina is about providing that<br>support<br>to maori students or pacifica students<br>i'm responsible for those in the early<br>childhood program<br>and as others there are different<br>secondary primary et cetera and<br>uh you know it's that<br>especially this i was just thinking the<br>three years there's two uh students over<br>here on my right rosie<br>has been um<br>they've uh<br>they started when covert came upon us<br>sort of that's all i've known at college<br>um and it's uh<br>there's been a fair bit of stress out<br>there uh and it's our job to sort of<br>support people through that as as best<br>we can<br>so i think that's all i need to say<br>but there are many of us doing this so<br>if it's a place you want to come away<br>and get away from other things you'll<br>find that<br>there's always people are looking out<br>for you which we think is a good thing<br>hi hi<br>thanks<br>and so we also have a um i've got to<br>make sure i don't have a double<br>we also have a maori and pacifica room<br>at the um the college as well which is<br>welcomes um people and it's a really<br>like a whatanui home for them<br>so<br>find my rose gold it's rose gold rose<br>gold okay<br>so now we're going to talk about each<br>individual program and just before sonia<br>gets up i'd like to say i'm very proud<br>of our programs we have just been<br>renewed by the teaching council<br>for a whole new set of programs which<br>launched this year which launched this<br>year that's way better isn't it<br>and um so you can do with a bachelor of<br>teaching an early childhood<br>primary primary goal by cultural so i'll<br>just i'll talk more about those later<br>but right now sonia gaichus is going to<br>come up<br>like naomi said as you can tell i'm not<br>originally from around here<br>spent over 20 something years teaching<br>little people in the us and<br>primarily in arizona and i'm originally<br>from kansas eastern kansas not the<br>farmlands but yeah okay anyways so i get<br>to talk about wonderful early childhood<br>education and in a minute our two third<br>years are going to get up here and and<br>keep me honest so you know when i tell<br>you they're here to double check and<br>share with you their experiences but<br>first of all uh naomi already touched<br>upon the fact that<br>um<br>relationships are really important<br>and definitely that's a very strong it's<br>the first thing i have done here<br>relationships are key<br>and that's really at the at the heart of<br>our program because it's also the heart<br>of early childhood education<br>everything's built upon relationships<br>we are a very small program and we'd say<br>that the university isn't particularly<br>like that because that means we cost a<br>lot<br>but<br>it's important because that's how you<br>have these relationships we're fono um<br>you come into our program and you are<br>going to go through the three years in<br>basically a cohort the same group of 25<br>or so we are lucky people or sometimes<br>smaller um<br>and so that it's it's a close-knit group<br>you share a lot<br>lifelong friends really um so that's the<br>important piece but i also want to talk<br>a little bit about this slide right here<br>because i think people are oftentimes<br>surprised to find out what early<br>childhood education means<br>so in early childhood education we focus<br>in new zealand outside of new zealand<br>the focus is on children's learning<br>dispositions and helping them develop<br>their working theories about how the<br>world works<br>so in this picture what kind of learning<br>might be happening<br>that teachers are hoping to facilitate<br>you've got three children digging in the<br>sand playing in the sand so there's some<br>uh trust going on there that they're<br>going to be able to play in the sand<br>they're kind of their kayako there<br>supporting them along the way there's<br>some contribution to each other's<br>learning<br>as they're playing together<br>the kayak was probably there kind of<br>helping to facilitate some of that<br>um what else do we see there<br>you guys want to chime in<br>lots of language going on language being<br>built because they're talking to each<br>other are kayaking's going to be asking<br>some beautiful open-ended questions what<br>do you think might happen if oh i wonder<br>what would happen oh how did you do that<br>that's teaching in early childhood<br>education<br>oh if we can get we could get into the<br>subject the other content areas the<br>the maths of quantity filling up the<br>bucket<br>the physics of how wet sand and dry sand<br>is different are similar the chemistry<br>there<br>so all kinds of things happening all<br>along the way that kayako is<br>facilitating that growth<br>we do plan for children's learning<br>because we're along the way we're taking<br>we're writing narratives about the<br>children's learning that says oh<br>here's what i saw happening today with<br>you today this is what i think it means<br>and now i'm going to use that to help<br>you learn in this way maybe<br>don't know if it's going to happen<br>that's what i'm going to go for we're<br>going to try that<br>that's what teaching early childhood<br>looks like in australia new zealand<br>yeah so i think there's another slide<br>there's another side i'm supposed to<br>but it's your special rose gold<br>okay um so this is a three-year<br>undergraduate program um as naomi<br>mentioned you have uh<br>in the executive you mentioned it or<br>they did a movie in the film there uh<br>that there are<br>professional experiences you have each<br>year if two in the first year two in the<br>second year and in the third year you're<br>in the same place the whole time<br>so that you have those relationships<br>the pro the degree qualifies you to<br>teach in kindergarten<br>early childhood care and education<br>settings<br>um<br>what else does it say yeah other early<br>childhood students home-based<br>any place that requires a qualified<br>early childhood education educator<br>that's what the bachelor teaching<br>program will give you um for one of the<br>questions i frequently get is what about<br>otago polytech<br>metagoli tech offers a level three and<br>level four qualifications those are not<br>teacher registration qualifications so<br>you have to have at least the bachelor's<br>teaching for that one thing you can do<br>though it's really cool you can do in<br>your study as you're studying for your<br>be teach<br>is we always need in the community<br>because we're always out in the<br>community with your placements<br>there's always a need for more early<br>childhood relievers and what a lot of<br>our students do<br>is while you are doing your bachelor's<br>teaching<br>instead of working at mcdonald's or<br>something you can be a relief teacher<br>and when you're not in classes you can<br>be relieving at early childhood<br>not the one you're placed at though but<br>nonetheless<br>um it's where you can automatically be<br>engaging with children from the very<br>beginning<br>so<br>i think that's enough of me talking<br>because i have these two wonderful<br>students here who have come to talk to<br>you tonight so i'm going to hand it over<br>taste test<br>um so we are third year early childhood<br>students<br>i actually<br>started my tertiary education with<br>first year health sci as a lot of<br>students do<br>and i quickly realized that actually<br>yeah so i quickly realized that it<br>actually wasn't for me<br>i'd always loved children education was<br>always<br>an option out there and so<br>in 2020 i decided to<br>change and do early childhood which<br>i'm so glad that i did<br>i have a great cohort so we're actually<br>one of the smallest cohorts<br>there's currently what like seven of us<br>but it just means that we're such a<br>close-knit group<br>we've got to become really close with<br>our teachers our lecturers<br>yeah which was great<br>in terms of<br>probably the most<br>important thing that i've kind of gained<br>out of these three years<br>is<br>the tedio maori so<br>just the journey that you go on and how<br>much you learn and how much you apply<br>into your placement is just like<br>very rewarding<br>um<br>yeah i think looking back on the three<br>years i've definitely grown so much and<br>progressed so much in my te o maori<br>and i'm doing like more outside of uni<br>now so i've kind of realized that once<br>these three years are up it's up to me<br>you know when i go into<br>my career as an early childhood teacher<br>it's up to me on how much i implement<br>into the centre that i'm at<br>even the placement that i'm at at the<br>moment is<br>a bilingual centre so that's really<br>pushed<br>my tedious journey even more um<br>but yeah that's probably the biggest<br>thing also just as sonia said like<br>relationships not just um with our<br>cohort and the lecturers but with the<br>tamariki as well that's kind of our<br>center focus and everything builds from<br>relationships so<br>yeah that's such an important<br>point and moment in a child's life and<br>just watching them grow like<br>they develop so so quickly in the first<br>few years of their life and you get to<br>be part of that and you get to<br>yeah help them develop and grow into<br>these confident capable young learners<br>so<br>yeah that's something that's really<br>rewarding as an early childhood teacher<br>yeah<br>so kiara i'm rosie um i first came into<br>ece um<br>actually i had a conversation and i was<br>somebody and i never really thought of<br>ece as like a career and i thought oh<br>like that sounds really interesting you<br>know i like getting to teach tamariki<br>and so i i worked at a centre for a<br>while like um<br>and then<br>i started studying and once i came here<br>like i just learnt so much more and so<br>much<br>more like sort of theoretical<br>understanding of like what happens<br>behind the child's play and like all the<br>learning that happens and how you see<br>that learning how you can extend it and<br>it's such a rewarding um<br>thing to study in a career and you just<br>learn so much about yourself and how to<br>see things from like a to our maori<br>world view is really cool as well and<br>like just um<br>yeah like enhancing the manner of the<br>child and<br>yeah it's so cool just getting to see<br>like the child<br>like just go cut like overcome<br>challenges and<br>get through each like stage of learning<br>and it's yeah it's so rewarding and um<br>yeah all of our lecturers are so<br>supportive like they you can tell they<br>really care about you and so if you're<br>ever struggling with an assignment you<br>can come to them<br>um<br>and yeah like you yeah the relationships<br>as everyone said are like really strong<br>just like you would um have with<br>tamariki as well so<br>yeah<br>oh<br>okay so next is my colleague fellow<br>coordinator and we're going to talk<br>thank you for lava i'm kiara kato katoa<br>andrea tokungua<br>i am the primary program coordinator and<br>it's wonderful to have you all here<br>tonight and get to share with<br>you that you're heading into or<br>potentially heading into the greatest<br>profession in the world<br>um call me by us i have been a teacher<br>for 25 years<br>but that says something too you know i<br>haven't changed multiple careers i from<br>the moment i stepped out the door of<br>this college i have loved being a<br>teacher<br>it's rewarding in so many ways<br>every day brings a different moment<br>there will be laughter there will be<br>tears but thankfully there'll be more<br>laughter because teaching is actually a<br>really enjoyable fun<br>job and you just get so much out of it<br>so it's really exciting to meet you and<br>think that you're considering this as<br>your next step<br>i think for me one of the highlights of<br>being a teacher has been able to share<br>my passions and my interests over the<br>years so i love music i love literacy i<br>love technology i'm all about well-being<br>of people and so that's one of the<br>privileges of being a teacher i get to<br>bring these passions and<br>things that i'm into into my classroom<br>and share it with my students<br>it's something that you will get to<br>bring into here at college and share<br>with us so i'm going to give you a<br>couple of tips for interviews in<br>particular<br>we want to know you and we want to know<br>what your curriculum strengths are do<br>you love music do you love math science<br>health<br>in the interview we will ask you what<br>your strengths are and we'd love for you<br>to share those with us<br>we also we want to get to know you and<br>part of lots of people have talked about<br>relationships that's another part of<br>being a teacher that i have really loved<br>the connections i've made over the years<br>with students and now that i'm in here<br>at college the connections i make with<br>the students here<br>we know you all by name in primary we<br>have a great cohort of first second and<br>third years<br>there are about<br>almost 300 students across first second<br>and third year and first year this year<br>we've got<br>97 students i think<br>so you're heading into a big group but<br>you will make friends for life but i'll</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
